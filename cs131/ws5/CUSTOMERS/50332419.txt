US	50332419	R3F98335JLS6J5	0670034231	929027984	The Big Over Easy: A Nursery Crime	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Sam Spade and the case of the sat-upon tuffet	Done with the Thursday next novels for now, Jasper Fforde has given us a brand new world (or has he?) with The Big Over Easy, a noir-like detective thriller set in a world where nursery rhymes are considered part of reality, where Humpty Dumpty can have a great fall and the police will actually look into it, and where Humpty is a notorious womanizer to boot.  While Fforde makes a valiant attempt, the book isn't quite as funny as it could be, but thankfully the story is interesting enough by itself that I can forgive it those little foibles.<br /><br />Jack Spratt, Detective Inspector of the Nursery Crime Division (and killer of four giants, though only one of them was *technically* a giant, and he was absolved of all blame), has a mind-boggling case on his hands as the good egg Humpty Dumpty has fallen off his wall and died.  Suicide is the first conclusion made by everybody, as he was depressed, seeking therapy, and acting very strangely.  However, it wouldn't be a murder mystery if there wasn't a murder now, would it?  Unfortunately for Jack, his superiors would like any excuse to shut down the Nursery Crimes Division, he's saddled with an assistant, Mary Mary (who insists that she's *not* contrary, thank you very much) who doesn't want to be there and who has dreams of becoming the assistant of the most popular Detective Inspector in the Reading Police Force, Friedland Chymes.  Will Mary betray the case in order to get her position?  And will Jack be able to figure out who murdered the egg without getting yolk on his face?  And what's with those beans that he received in exchange for his mother's picture?<br /><br />The Big Over Easy does a wonderful job of combining the mood of the typical detective novel and the world of nursery rhymes, with everybody taking them completely seriously.  I loved the extrapolation Fforde makes for these characters, with Wee Willie Winkie having narcolepsy and Humpty being a philanderer as well as a philanthropist.  Jack is just getting off of a case where he tried to pin murder charges on the three little pigs, saying their killing of the Big Bad Wolf was premeditated because it took them at least six hours to get the pot of water boiling.  These sorts of flights of fancy are what really make the book, and I couldn't resist a chuckle or two.<br /><br />I also liked the nods to mysteries, and how detectives gain more prestige by being written up in detective magazines, though it doesn't say much for the justice system that the jury bases a large part of its verdict on how famous the detective is.  The mystery part of the book even has a wink to Agatha Christie in it, which was really nice.  Fforde succeeds in making the characters come off the page in interesting fashion, making us care about how downtrodden Jack feels, the elation when he gets one over on Chymes, and the feeling that Chymes will be back next book and not very happy.  How Mary is torn between her growing respect for Jack and her ambition to become Chymes assistant.  Even the minor characters have their moments, and are interesting to read about when they're on the page.<br /><br />This is a good thing, because as much as I'm sure I was supposed to, I just didn't laugh that much while reading this book.  I had a chuckle or two, I was amused at times, and a couple of the chapter headings made me laugh out loud (like how the \\"Locked Room Mystery\\" has been laid to rest, but then it was found to have been murdered).  Each chapter begins with a  snippet from a newspaper account of something, often having something to do with the chapter it is in, but other times just being there for amusement's sake.  These were often quite good (and as I said, occasionally made me laugh), but they did start to sound the same after a while.  I found the idea that the ending centers around amusing, but the actual ending itself I thought dragged on a bit and lost its humour value very quickly.<br /><br />Fforde doesn't really tie this book into the Thursday Next series, with the only reference being the aging starlet Lola Vavoom, so I hope this means that they aren't part of the same series.  The change in venue really seems to have revived his creative juices, as there is a lot of neat stuff in The Big Over Easy  Every time I thought of something that defeats the internal logic of this world, Fforde would offer up something that makes everything fit.  His vivid imagination is what kept the Next series going, and I see that it will continue with Jack's series.  That's a good sign.  If Fforde can make the next book funnier without slipping into absurdity, then he will have a wonderful series on his hands.  Jasper (if I can call you Jasper), you already have me interested in the characters.  Make me laugh, and you'll have another sale.<br /><br />David Royinto the Thursday Next series, with the only reference being the aging starlet Lola Vavoom, so I hope this means that they aren't part of the same series.

US	50332419	R3AZUMU70H2YDN	0060776056	3244097	Year's Best Fantasy 5	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Another year, another collection of great fantasy stories	For the past five years, editors David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer put together a new Year's Best Fantasy book, and every year it is a thoroughly enjoyable read.  I may not agree with all of their choices, but I rarely find a story that I really didn't want to read.  This year's 5th edition is no different.  There aren't as many stories in it that make me stand up and pay attention, but all of them are quite good, even the ones that I have a bit of a problem with (stand up Joel Lane).  Even better is the wide range of sources the editors draw from for their choices.  A great number of them came from the book Flights, which I haven't read, so there weren't too many stories that I was already familiar with (though since I am now subscribing to three different short story magazines, some of them have been read before).<br /><br />Thankfully, some of the regular contributors to these anthologies (Neil Gaiman, Tanith Lee) don't annoy me like they have in the past.  Lee's writing has never been my favourite (though I did like her \\"Moonblind\\" in last year's book), but \\"Elvenbrood is a very strong story about a shattered family who is attempting to move on, and the weird things in the woods outside that want the daughter as part of a pact that the father made.  Gaiman finally moves on from the \\"weird character in the story tells a story\\" motif, though just barely, with \\"The Problem of Susan.\\"  Like \\"Beyond the River\\" (discussed below), this is a story of an interviewer visiting an author, though Gaiman's story goes in a different direction and takes a bit more of a horrific turn at the end.<br /><br />The one story I had a problem with was \\"Beyond the River,\\" by Joel Lane.  A young journalist goes to visit an old children's book writer for an article on her life, as well as the breach of contract charges that have been brought up against her by the company that has bought her books.  It seems they want to re-issue them with a lot of changes to make them more \\"accessible\\" to the modern reader, which she refuses to do.  It's a pointed story about the publishing business, but it has a major misstep that threw me out of the story.  It takes a weird turn when the interviewer, a woman, is asked to spend the night at Susanne's house because it's late, and the interviewer starts talking about whether or not the invitation was sexual or a seduction.  While this may be a normal first question in a male-female meeting, it's not in a female-female meeting when there has been no hint of sexual tension before that, and there has been no hint that either of the characters are gay.  It felt completely out of left field.  Plus, the storyline is tremendously heavy-handed in its vilification of the mass-publishing market and how book lines can become mass-produced.  The world that Susanne introduces the interviewer to is kind of interesting in a fairy-tale sort of way, but these two things made the story much less enjoyable to read than it should have been.<br /><br />For me, one of the strongest stories in the book (I'll refrain from mentioning Kage Baker's story here, though it is well worth reading) was \\"Life in Stone,\\" by Tim Pratt.  It's the story of an immortal that wants to die, and the assassin he hires to do it.  The immortal hid his soul away hundreds of years ago, and can't die until its container is destroyed.  Unfortunately, he can't remember where he hid it.  Mr. Zealand, the assassin, is trying to find it, based on obscure clues that Archibald Grace, the immortal, can remember.  Usually, this sends Zealand on a dangerous wild goose chase, like at the beginning of the story where he has to fight something straight out of Lovecraft.  When Grace's long-lost daughter, Hannah, gets involved, things get even trickier.  I loved the tender relationship between Zealand and Grace, especially contrasted with the harsh way that Zealand treats Hannah.  The ending is also quite good, with things not quite turning out the way you think they will.<br/><br />Another real winner was \\"A Hint of Jasmine,\\" by the ever-reliable Richard Parks.  I'm really starting to like his stories, as his current ones in Realms of Fantasy have been quite inspired.  This story is a ghost story about past regrets.  Eli is a ghost hunter, and he's asked to an old southern mansion by an old classmate and her daughter.  Around the end of the Civil War, there was a slave massacre, and the ghosts of the slaves continue to haunt the mansion.  However, there is much more to the story, including the story of the two women, then meets the eye.  Why was Eli called here, and what do the women really want?  This is not a horror story at all, despite being about ghosts.  Instead, it's about family and heritage, and the relationship between a woman and her daughter.  All of the characters are done beautifully, and the mystery just continues to build until Eli figures out what is going on.  The prose is good and Parks has created yet another interesting plot to put them through.  Well-recommended.<br /><br />Year's Best Fantasy 5 is another winning collection of fantasy short stories, with every story offering something to the reader.  There are also a lot of famous names in the fantasy field included in this volume, so there should be something for everyone.  Unless you have an aversion to short fiction, this is one you have to pick up.<br /><br />David Royl. <br /> <br />Another real winner was \\"A Hint of Jasmine,\\" by the ever-reliable Richard Parks.

US	50332419	R1Y3DYW314EM8M	1416507744	254295588	Harbinger (Star Trek Vanguard)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	An interesting new Trek series	Pocket Books has launched a new series of Star Trek books, set during the early period of Kirk's time.  The series is Star Trek: Vanguard, and the first book, Harbinger is an excellent start.  Written by David Mack, one of the premier authors of the line, it carries an interesting concept, some rather unique (at least for Star Trek) characters, and some wonderful plotting.  It definitely leaves me waiting impatiently for the next book.<br /><br />Starbase 47, also known as Vanguard, is a station way out beyond Federation space, in a zone sandwiched between the Klingon Empire and Tholian space.  Built very quickly, it also has a secret purpose, one which only a few members of Starfleet's hierarchy know.  Captain Kirk is bringing the Enterprise back from the edge of the galaxy, after the events of the television episode \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before.\\"  The ship is battered, his friend is dead at his own hand, and Kirk just wants to get home and refit.  He discovers that the Vanguard station is along their way home, and is much closer than limping back to Federation space, so he takes the Enterprise there.  When he gets there, his suspicions are aroused by the reluctance of Commodore Reyes to answer his questions about why the station is out there, and he becomes determined to get to the bottom of what's going on.<br /><br />Let me start right away by saying that, while a lot of the description of the above was about Kirk, this is *not* his book.  Kirk and the Enterprise are only in this book to do a \\"hand-off\\" to the crew and characters of Vanguard, much like the appearance of Picard in Deep Space Nine's pilot.  This is the raw rookie Kirk, not yet the legend, and people don't kowtow to him (though he isn't above bullying his way in anyway).  Reyes shoots him down quite quickly when Kirk begins demanding answers.  I quite liked Reyes' character, as he has quite a few flaws, but he is loyal to his crew and to Starfleet, as well as harboring a secret or two of his own.  I loved the scenes between Kirk and him, where Mack illustrates the differences between the two commanders.<br /><br />Mack handles the other characters brilliantly too, introducing them all in scenes that don't sink to \\"info-dump\\" level, instead having their initial scenes flow from the characters themselves.  Pennington, the Federation News Service reporter, is having an affair with one of the officers on the Bombay (a ship assigned to Vanguard), whose husband happens to be a crewmember on the Enterprise.  He's a reporter with a keen eye for a story, and a willingness to dig very deep if necessary.  Throughout the book, Pennington's life goes from a great high at the beginning of the book to a deep low as events happen.  By the time the inevitable happens and he begins to think his life can't get any worse, the reader has grown to care about him a great deal.  He is probably one of the best new characters in the book, but he is not the only one.<br /><br />This crew is not your typical Star Trek crew.  This is a time where the utopia of the Next Generation series hasn't happened yet, and the Federation is still in danger of falling to an outside threat if they're not careful.  The characters are not perfect, and some have really deep flaws.  Not only that, but Mack doesn't present us with the normal \\"captain, first officer, chief engineer, etc\\" crew.  Reyes is the commander, we briefly see the first officer, but he's not a main character.  Instead, we have a reporter, a merchant/smuggler (for those of you familiar with the old Trek series, think Cyrano Jones), an Orion crime lord, a Federation diplomat and his assistant (the assistant also being a Klingon spy) and a Starfleet Intelligence agent, among others.  This eclectic mix just adds to the story possibilities.<br /><br />As for the plot, Starfleet has discovered something mysterious and potentially valuable in the Taurus Reach (the area of space where Vanguard is), and it must be kept secret from the Klingons and Tholians.  They desperately want to know what it is.  This storyline will continue through the series, so we're not given too much information about this find, other than it appears to be a massive amount of raw data.  The way Mack has written this first book, the ideas for where this story can go are endless, and they don't all have to revolve around this overarching plot.  That's the sign of a good series, and I hope it continues.<br /><br />In typical Mack fashion, Harbinger has quite a lot of death and destruction, but uncharacteristically, this only takes place in one scene.  The rest of the book is quite character-based, introducing all of them and showing us how they are related.  Mack writes these scenes almost flawlessly, with each one building strongly on the ones before it. He switches effortlessly between the numerous character threads, having them interact occasionally, and parceling out their secrets like he's awarding treats to the reader.  It's quite effective in making you keep going, and I finished this book much more quickly than I usually do, as I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Harbinger makes a wonderful beginning to the Vanguard saga, and as Kirk and company head off back to Earth, I'm quite confident that the crew and residents of Starbase 47 can stand on their own numerous feet.  David Mack's given them a good start, and the stars are the limit for where they can go.  This is one of the best Trek books of the year.<br /><br />David Royhe Klingons and Tholians.

And if that sounds confusing, that's because Tor has decided to put all six books into that series name, despite the fact that it's two different trilogies.  In this book, a lot of the intricacies of the previous two books are undone and it's a lot more straightforward than either Medalon or Treason Keep.  That can be a good thing, except that it loses a little bit of what makes Fallon's work so special.  It's still a fitting conclusion, but things are wrapped up a bit too quickly and the characters are a bit flatter than normal.<br /><br />Usually, I really like the way Fallon handles political intrigue, juggling so many balls that many authors would likely lose them all.  In Harshini, she does a decent job, but I didn't get the same sense I have in her previous books, where R'Shiel and her companions have to constantly be moving in order to keep all of the balls in the air.  Instead, this book almost has her do it in step-by-step fashion.  She's solved one problem with Damin and Adrina's marriage, so she travels with them to Hytheria.  There, Damin has his own problems, especially with having a Fardohnyan bride, so R'Shiel has to help him solve that problem.  Then another roadblock gets in the way, and dealing with that one also helps her deal with a subsequent one.  Then she has to go back to Medalon for the final showdown.  It's almost fantasy politics by rote, and it got a little boring.  Thankfully, Fallon's skill with characterization made sure that it didn't get too dull.<br /><br />R'Shiel is still done very well, though she became a bit more wooden in this book than she has in the past.  The only time I was able to get deep into her character was when Brak, another half-Harshini man, showed her the true meaning of being Harshini.  The wonder that was on her face and in her eyes was fabulous, and Fallon described it very well.  However, the rest of the book she's like a bull in a china shop, demanding that various gods help her in certain ways, being reprimanded even as the gods sullenly do as she asks; always promising that there will be a reckoning, but there never seems to be.  One might say that her final heartbreak would be punishment enough, but that was already coming even before she annoyed a number of the gods, so it can't really be considered her comeuppance.<br /><br />While Tarja is much the same way, more two-dimensional than I'm used to from Fallon, she really excels at characterizing Damin and Adrina.  Their relationship is a joy to watch, as both of them have walls around themselves so high that they don't trust the other one, even when it's obvious to everybody around them that they love each other.  Damin is a wonderful combination of sarcasm and intelligence, with the sarcasm hiding a deep devotion to Hytheria and to the people he loves.  Adrina is, at times, too much of a spoiled brat, but it was how she was raised.  Other characters aren't as strong, with Adrina's father coming off the worst.  He's stereotypically greedy and wimpy when R'Shiel demonstrates her full power to him, and he just doesn't come off the page very well.  I found him annoying every time I saw him, which makes it nice that it wasn't very often.<br /><br />The major problem with Harshini, however, is the dropped plot threads that just scream for better treatment.  The book is short by today's fantasy standards, and I think it could have used a few more pages to handle some of these, or at least Fallon could have re-worked things to actually resolve them better.  The first is Loclon (who I also complained about in Treason Keep), whose storyline just withers on the vine until it's resolved in an almost perfunctory fashion at the very end.  He hates R'Shiel for what she did to him, and she hates him for what he did to her in captivity.  They spend a lot of time talking about having to find him in the Citadel and not letting him escape during the siege, but then he simply disappears.  He then turns up again for a brief appearance so that Fallon can end his storyline.  The other plot thread that goes nowhere is what happens to little Mikel.  After what he's coerced into attempting to do, he's cast off without a second thought.  At least his story does end in a fairly believable fashion, but it's not very interesting.  Sure, it manages to throw some more conflict between Damin and Adrina, but that doesn't really go anywhere either, making this storyline seem even worse.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, Harshini is an enjoyable climax to the series, and I'm looking forward to the next one (a prequel).  While it's not as good as the first two books, it's not a complete dud.  I just wish Fallon would have done a few things differently.<br /><br />David Royscape during the siege, but then he simply disappears.

US	50332419	R3NWQKKU8BFUPC	0345451120	142978299	Straken (High Druid of Shannara, Book 3)	Books	4	15	17	N	N	A touch of the familiar, a touch of the obvious...	And so, another Terry Brooks trilogy has come to an end. With Straken, Brooks has now ended his High Druid of Shannara series, and he does it on a pretty good note. This has certainly been his strongest series for quite a while now, but even so, the last book has some major faults that keep it from being wonderful. According to his web site, he is writing a \\"Pre-Shannara\\" trilogy next, which is supposedly about the fall of the civilization that led to the way the Four Lands are today. It seems different enough, and I hope that it stays that way, as Straken (not to mention this entire series) shows that he really needs a break from it. Maybe completely changing the focus will help.<br /><br />When we last left our heroes, Grianne Ohmsford, the High Druid (or \\"Ard Rhys\\") had been captured in the Forbidding (an alternate plane where the druids had imprisoned all of the demons of the world) by a demon with ambitions beyond the Forbidding. In fact, they were plans to destroy it and unleash the imprisoned demonic hordes on Shannara itself. Grianne's rival druids had imprisoned her there, ostensibly because of her evil past, but mostly because they are hungry for the power she wields. But they don't know about the demon's plans, and they are unwittingly helping him. Meanwhile, Pen Ohmsford, Grianne's nephew, has sacrificed the woman he loves and a part of his body in order to forge the Darkwand, a way into the Forbidding so he can rescue his aunt. Pen's parents have been captured by the druids and must escape themselves, while Pen's friends fight desperately to come to his aid. But even if Pen succeeds in freeing his aunt, he finds he must still face the demon that has escaped the Forbidding, before it destroys the only thing that stands in the way of waves of demonic invaders.<br /><br />I have to say that Straken was certainly more interesting than Tanequil was. While the book contains the normal brooding of all of Brooks' characters, it's not as noticeable as it usually is, making for a much more engrossing book. Brooks avoids some of the predictable pitfalls, but he falls into others. The ending is telegraphed a mile away, as Brooks just can't seem to allow a tragic ending, especially where romance is concerned. With Grianne going on and on about how much she fears using her magic after some of her encounters in the Forbidding (where she had to unleash some of the magic she used to wield when she was a villain), you know how she'll end up. Granted, I didn't realize how Brooks would tie things together, but those are just the details. The overarching plot was very obvious.<br /><br />That being said, the trip was mostly interesting. There's a good deal of action, and Brooks usually excels at those scenes. Some of it is a tad unbelievable (some characters go a very long time with almost mortal injuries that never seem to end up killing them), but it's well-done for the most part. The final confrontation between Grianne and her fellow druids is actually quite good, with just the right amount of power, skill, and luck involved. Two of the more interesting secondary characters, Kermadec and his brother (both Trolls loyal to Grianne) are heavily involved, and that makes for a riveting scene. In fact, the final fifty or so pages, making up the attack on the druid castle and the ultimate battle really gripped me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book continues on from there for a bit, and gets dull and thoroughly superfluous again. The plot that's been hiding behind everything, of the demon wanting to destroy the gate to the Forbidding, is ended almost perfunctorily, with little of interest in it. I'd almost say it was an afterthought, if the characters hadn't been talking about it for two books already. It does give us a reason why Brooks shows so much of the war between the Elves, Dwarves, and Gnomes against the Federation, which seemed completely pointless throughout the last two books, but that doesn't help with the ending. Not only that, but again Brooks, who hasn't been afraid to kill characters before, thoroughly invalidates one of the more tragic and touching scenes he's written by bringing the characters back to life (oh, I'm sorry...I mean that they were never dead). I can say no more without spoilers, but you'll probably recognize it when you get there.<br /><br />Up to this point, this review has been mostly a rant, and you must be thinking \\"four stars? How does he give it four stars?\\" There are some (unfortunately long) dull passages in Straken, but Brooks makes up for it by providing us with a lot of interesting characters, even if their actions don't seem to lead anywhere at times. I've always enjoyed Bed and Rue, Pen's parents, and they are on good display again here. They show determination, courage, and loyalty to each other that make them extremely interesting. They throw themselves into the action despite Bek's vow not to use his magic ever again, and Rue's horror when she discovers that Pen has magic similar to his father's is quickly set aside in order to continue the mission. Rue's love for Bek shows in how desperate she fights for what will turn out to be the rescue of a woman she has never really liked since she caused the deaths of a number of her companions all those years ago.<br /><br />Add to these any number of minor characters, most of whom Brooks also characterizes very well, and you get one heck of an interesting read for the most part. The strains of the continuing Shannara saga are showing, and Brooks really needs the change that it seems is coming, because this series is running on fumes. Thankfully, some of those fumes are quite powerful in themselves, and make what should be a thoroughly pedestrian read a lot better than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />David Roybeen afraid to kill characters before, thoroughly invalidates one of the more tragic and touching scenes he's written by bringing the characters back to life (oh, I'm sorry...I mean that they were never dead).

Thankfully, some of those fumes are quite powerful in themselves, and make what should be a thoroughly pedestrian read a lot better than the sum of its parts.     David Roy	2005-09-06

Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy, has to be one of the best books I have ever read on World War I, and one of the most compact yet comprehensive history books I've seen.  It is less than 500 pages, but it covers every aspect of the war, from the strategy involved to the politics of starting, running, and, most importantly, ending the war.  It goes beyond even that, though, by discussing the impact the war had on the post-war years, analyzing the years between the two world wars and even how memories of the war affected how the second one was fought.  As a final thought, the conclusion discusses how the war has been looked at over time, how perceptions have changed, not only of who started the war, but also how it was fought.<br /><br />All of this in under 500 pages?  The coverage must be fairly superficial then, right?  Not at all.  Not only is Cataclysm thorough, but it's incredibly dense.  This is not a book that you will read quickly.  I am a fairly fast reader, and it took me nearly two weeks to finish the book, because it is extremely packed.  Long paragraphs (sometimes almost a page long) abound, with the richness of the detail flowing off the page.  Some books take this long to read because they are excessively dry, trying to stuff everything into the book but not integrating it very well.  This book doesn't do that.  Everything is related, and Stevenson draws the reader in with a lot of interesting information about whatever he is talking about.<br /><br />The flow of the book is logical, but it is not completely chronological.  The first section discusses the outbreak of the war, giving extensive detail about what led to the war.  He even gives a few details about the minor wars that happened in the years leading up to World War I, such as the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, and discusses what the world was like before the outbreak of the war.  He uses all of this information to give insight into the thought processes and events that led to the almost inevitable conflagration that turned into one of the most horrific wars of our time.  After this section, he discusses the widening of the war, the battles of 1915-1917, and then jumps back to cover other aspects of the war.  This includes the home front, the political maneuverings in all of the belligerent governments, naval warfare, tactics, economics, and war aims, just to name some.  He then moves on to the outcome of the war, how it ended, the politics of the ceasefire, and the collapse of the German army.  Finally, he discusses the aftermath, and he doesn't just stop at the peace treaty.  He goes all the way up to the end of World War II and beyond.<br /><br />This is what I loved about Cataclysm.  Stevenson doesn't just give us what happened.  He discusses the purpose (or at least what the purpose was at the time, even if it doesn't seem to make any sense in modern times) of what happened, what the politicians were thinking, and what they were trying to accomplish.  He delves into how the politicians managed to keep the civilians engaged in the fighting, and how limited any anti-war movements were until the war seemed to be an intractable stalemate.  Stevenson even gives great detail about lesser-known campaigns, such as that in the Middle East which has produced much of the modern-day strife.  He covers Austria-Hungary and their battles against both Russia and Italy, as well as the war with Serbia, most of which have been given short shrift in World War I books I have read.<br /><br />The writing, as I have said, is quite dense, but it's not his prose which makes it a slow read.  I did not see any superfluous text in the book at all, and almost all of it was interesting.  I kept stumbling upon things that I didn't know, or I knew little about, and Stevenson covers it all in a depth that is surprising in a book under 500 pages.  I did have to laugh at his introduction, where he says that he has deliberately kept the end notes to a minimum in each chapter.  Then I discovered that there are many chapters with notes that run into the three digits.  I think this is a good thing, as I love notated history books, but I did find it funny that he would say that.  Cataclysm is thoroughly researched, and the number of notes reflects this.  The bibliography is quite extensive too.  All of the maps are at the front of the book, and there are definitely many.<br /><br />The only minor fault was the use (or non-use) of commas, and this could just be a legitimate way of doing it that I have never heard of before.  A number of times, I would read a sentence and have to go back and re-read it because a comma appeared to be missing, completely jarring my understanding of the sentence, or at least the flow of it.  However, if that is the worst thing I can say about the book, it must mean the book is wonderful.  And it is.  This could be considered the definitive book on World War I and all its aspects.  I do know that you won't find anything like this in as small a package as Cataclysm is.  If you have any interest in the war, or just military history in general, you should pick this one up.<br /><br />David Royhave to laugh at his introduction, where he says that he has deliberately kept the end notes to a minimum in each chapter.

US	50332419	R2IAWAZH3L3QDQ	1416505202	599086759	Tales From the Captain's Table (Star Trek)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	I want to go this bar!!!!	A few years ago, Pocket Books came out with a series of six Star Trek books that were called Captain's Table, each a story of one of the series' captains at that time (Picard, Janeway, Sisko, Calhoun, Kirk, and Pike).  That series was quite successful, but there have been quite a few more captains in the series since then.  Thus was born the latest Trek anthology, Tales from the Captain's Table, edited by Keith R.A. DeCandido.<br /><br />Probably my favourite story in the bunch is \\"The Officer's Club\\" by Heather Jarman.<br /><br />I've criticized Jarman in the past for her two novels, but  I greatly enjoyed her last short story (in Tales of the Dominion War), but this one was even better.  It's a story of Kira's time in the resistance, where she has to infiltrate an officer's club run by collaborators, apparently including her brother, in order to kidnap one of the Cardassians' greatest communications techs in order to stop the upgrading of communications in the Bajoran sector.  What she discovers there is not what she expected, as apparently the club is a front for another resistance cell.  Or is it?  Who can Kira trust?  And is her brother the collaborator she thought he was?  Kira will have to sacrifice a lot in order finish her mission, and she will not remain unaffected by it.  This story is even better than the previous Jarman story I mention above.  It has a completely believable Kira, who hasn't been completely hardened by the circumstances of her life yet, though she's well on her way.  It has betrayal, intrigue, and wonderful characters all the way around.  It's the longest story yet (though it's not the longest in the book), so Jarman has space to create these characters, manipulate them, and make us care for them.  There are also enough twists and turns that the reader is kept guessing until the very end what the truth really is.  This is probably my favourite story in the book.<br /><br />Another good one is \\"Pain Management\\" by Peter David.  Shelby is one of my favourite New Frontier characters (what I've read of it, anyway), so I was looking forward to this story.  Here, the Trident is in for refit and repairs after being damaged in a massive ambush during the Selelvian/Tholian war.  At the starbase, Soleta, science officer of the Exalibur (Shelby's former ship, captained by Shelby's husband) happens to be there for a conference and offers her a ride back to Excalibur to see her husband while the Trident is being repaired.  On the way, they are shot down by an Orion ship and crash land.  Surrounded by Orions in a cave, Soleta does what she has to do to take them out, knowing that either she will die, or her horrible secret (she's half-Romulan) will be revealed.  Shelby must choose between an oath to a friend, and loyalty to that very same friend.  And she's not happy about it.  This story is also quite good, filling in a little bit of backstory on both Shelby and Soleta, detailing how Soleta's heritage came to be known.  There's a little bit of that old \\"Peter denying Jesus\\" feel at the end, where Shelby has to choose whether to deny knowing about Soleta's secret in order to save her own career.  The action is well done, and David's characteristic humour is there for all to see.  He manages to make Soleta both very Vulcan and yet very sardonic at the same time.  At times tense, at times heart-wrenching, this story is one of the good ones.<br /><br />Which brings me to my least favourite.  \\"Darkness\\" by Michael Jan Friedman.  Picard is asked to provide his own tale, and he tells the story of what happened just after he had lost his own ship, the Stargazer.  He is very depressed after the inquiry into the loss of the ship, as even though he was acquitted of any wrong-doing, he still feels responsible. He's on a journey to see an old friend, to see if she can offer any solace and advice to him on where to go from here.  On the way to her planet, he passes through an ion storm that ends up messing with his engines,forcing him to ditch his ship.  The population of the planet he lands on is being subjugated by the Skillig, ruthless raiders, and he ends up getting involved with them.  Helping them and discovering a forgotten portion of his past brings him to a decision point about his present and future.  As with many of Friedman's stories, I found this one kind of forgettable, though it is well-told.  The twist at the end is well done, but otherwise it felt much the same as other stories I've read.  There's not really a lot different here.  To show how forgettable the story was:  most of these min-reviews, I've had to look at the story again to get a detail or a name right.  This story, I had to look at the story again to remember what happened in the story.  That's not a good sign.<br /><br />As with most anthologies, the quality of the stories varies.  I can say, however, that they are all enjoyable, even the ones from authors I have questioned before.  DeCandido does a wonderful job tying all of the stories together, almost giving them a sequence as one captain leaves and another comes to the bar.  With a mixture of tall tales, tales of \\"dubious credibility,\\" and a couple of stories that fill in a hole or two in the respective series, Tales from the Captain's Table is definitely a must read for any Trek fan.  Who knows?  You may find a series that you like and decide to go read it.<br /><br />David Roynes, forcing him to ditch his ship.

Beaumont mystery by J.A. Jance.  Set in Seattle (one of the series' draws for me), Beaumont has gone from police detective to part of the Special Homicide Investigation Team (with an unfortunate acronym which gets brought up quite often) for the state of Washington.  For some reason, the Jance books I have read always seem to be the ones where Beaumont makes a monumental change in his life, and this one is no different.  That's another draw for me, as I like it when characters change, circumstances are adjusted, and nobody remains static.  Thus, Long Time Gone is another great entry in this series, and I greatly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Beaumont gets involved in two cases this time, one by assignment and one by friendship.  A middle-aged nun unexpectedly recalls what happened fifty years ago that traumatized her to this day.  She witnessed a neighbour's murder and she hasn't been able to remember anything about this until now.  This wouldn't be that big of a deal, because most of the participants are almost dead (and some are dead already), but the coconspirators happen to be prominent members of the Seattle community, and they will go to any effort to cover up their crime, no matter how long ago it was.  Secondly, Beaumont's former partner, Ron Peters, is the prime suspect in the murder of his ex-wife, and a lot of the evidence points against him.  Beaumont cannot help getting involved, despite being ordered not to, because the ties of friendship are very tight.  Beau has to tap dance very carefully in both of these cases, and if he makes one misstep, it may be his last.<br /><br />One of the things I loved about Long Time Gone is that, while the events of the two cases do end up intertwining, they are unrelated.  In a lot of clich&eacute;d mysteries, Ron's wife would have ended up stumbling upon something to do with the murders the nun saw, and thus the two cases would end up being related.  That isn't the case this time.  Characters do become involved in both (the nun comes with Beau to Ron's house and helps deal with one of Ron's daughters, and the female detective that Beau starts falling for, who is investigating Ron, ends up helping with the nun's case), but they remain separate issues.  I get so tired of that clich&eacute;, and I loved how Jance avoids that.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about the book, and the series in general, is the way that Jance draws the characters.  Beau, being the hero, is the most three-dimensional.  He's still coming to terms with his wife's death, even though it happened a long time ago.  He finds his growing attraction to Melanie very hard to deal with, as he still feels the ties to his wife.  The fact that they work very well together just makes it harder, and there are the typical bumps in the road in their growing relationship. The story is told in Beau's first person, but Melanie is still three-dimensional, with Jance giving us little touches like her addiction to talk radio.  And given that addiction, it was nice to see Jance avoid the stereotype of the typical \\"conservative.\\"  Mel is actually quite a likable character, and I loved seeing the developing relationship between the two of them.  They are mature individuals, who don't hop in the sack at the first sign of attraction, and that was nice too.<br /><br />The other characters are given as much depth as they deserve, with some (Ron's family) getting a lot, and others, who are only in the book for a couple of scenes, getting just enough so they're not cardboard.  The various suspects and those involved in the cases are also well-done, giving us enough information that we can make our own conclusions about whether they would be capable of committing the murders.  In fact, I don't think there is a character misstep in the book at all.  They're all interesting in one way or another. The only minor annoyance was Beau's old boss at the Seattle Police Department, who was just a bit over the top in his antagonism toward Beau (and everybody else).  That is a long-standing character trait for him, so it's fruitless to hope that it would change here, but he has always been my least favourite character.<br /><br />The mysteries are both intriguing, and Jance hops between them with a lot of skill.  It's interesting how the fifty-year-old murder trail is pretty cold, but things start to heat up when it's discovered that somebody is trying to open it again.  When people start dying again, it positively burns.  Jance does touch briefly on Beau reflecting on the fact that these people's deaths are directly caused by his meddling in the case, as a long-dormant hornet's nest is stirred once again.  Meanwhile, Jance handles Ron's case well too, showcasing the close relationship Beau has with Ron's daughters, almost as a treasured uncle.  What really happens in Ron's case is very tragic, and shows the effects that family strife can have on young girls (or young people in general).  The final revelation about the killer's past is a little bit \\"yeah right,\\" but it's not too bad.  Once you know, you can see how Jance has laid the clues for it, so at least it doesn't come out of the blue.  Both are interesting, though, and I never wanted Jance to move back to the one when the other was \\"on screen.\\"<br /><br />All in all, Long Time Gone was a great mystery with surprising depth of character.  It holds your attention and doesn't let go.  It doesn't deal with deep philosophical issues (do many mysteries?), but it does give the reader an interesting plot with intriguing characters to read about.  It's a nice way to spend your reading time.  And if you're from Seattle, or familiar with it, the location is just an added bonus.<br /><br />David Roym toward Beau (and everybody else).

Nevertheless, I decided to ask my library to get a copy of the New Frontier short story anthology, No Limits.  The series is exclusively written by Peter David, so it was interesting to see how these characters would be handled by other writers (though edited by David).<br /><br />Perhaps I expected to be able to catch up before it came in to the library, I don't know.  But it didn't, and I realize after finishing the book that it may have been a mistake to read this book first.  It doesn't contain many spoilers for the book series (except for the New Frontier timeline at the back of the book), but it tells some of the back story of a lot of the New Frontier characters, some of whom I haven't met yet.  These stories also give us history to some of the conflicts that are currently taking place in the series, such as that between Kat Mueller and Cray, the Andorian.  Of course, I haven't encountered either one of these characters before, so the story (\\"Performance Appraisal,\\" by Allyn Gibson) lost a lot of its impact.  It's still a well-told story, and I did enjoy it, but the nuances were completely missed.<br /><br />That being said, the anthology was a hit and miss affair, but most of the stories were at least entertaining.  In the aforementioned \\"Performance Appraisal,\\" we get the story of Kat Mueller when she was still an assistant chief engineer on the Grissom as she vies for the position of \\"nightside\\" commander.  She has developed a new method of detecting cloaked Romulan warships that they are testing near the Neutral Zone.  Unfortunately, they come upon a Romulan ship that claims they have crossed the border and threatens to blow them to pieces.  It will take quick thinking from Mueller to save the ship and prevent the Romulans from figuring out exactly why they were there in the first place.  Even without knowing the characters, the story is still extremely well-written and fun (especially seeing the Romulan commander, Tomalok, again).  Cray's malevolence is palpable, especially in the final scene which obviously leads up to what's happening in the book series now.<br /><br />Another good story is the first one, \\"Loose Ends,\\" by Dayton Ward.  This tells the story of an intelligence mission when Calhoun was working for Starfleet Intelligence, involving the aftermath to the \\"Next Generation\\" episode, \\"The Pegasus.\\"  Picard has agreed to turn over the illegal Federation cloaking device that as on the Pegasus.  Calhoun has been tasked with infiltrating the Romulan ship and destroying it.  The way he does so is quite ingenious, and Ward's story is definitely a great way to kick of the anthology.  The story has an energy and a wit that is very much in the vein of Peter David, though it doesn't sink into silliness as David's work sometimes can.  I did think that Calhoun succeeded a little too easily in his task, but that would be the only fault I can think of.  The writing is crisp, the story moves quickly, and Ward packs a lot into a few pages, showcasing Calhouns sense of loyalty (to Picard, who sponsored him for Starfleet).<br /><br />The best story in the anthology, though, is David Mack's \\"Waiting for G'Doh,\\" or \\"How I Learned to Stop Moving and Hate People.\\"  This is an early story in Zak Kebron's life.  Zak is a Brikar, huge and rock-like, with a wicked sense of humour (though it's not really in evidence in this story).  He's assigned a mission of staking out a park on the planet Iban, where a Federation bureaucrat named G'Doh is meeting some Cardassian agents to pass on some secrets.  Zak, being rather conspicuous, is going to be beamed inside a statue in the park, where he will have to remain motionless until the meeting takes place.  His only point of contact with the outside world isSotak, the Intelligence agent who communicates with him about the constant delays in the meeting.  Poor Zak suffers all the indignities, including having a bird do its business on him, all of which he has to suffer silently.  This leaves nothing but his thoughts, and those are hilarious as told by Mack.  This is one of the few stories in the book that really seems to capture the Peter David humour.  From the title of the story to all of the jokes inside, to the seemingly never-ending wait for the arrival of the G'Doh, this story doesn't miss a beat.  Even more surprising, since nothing actually happens in the story until the end (which, I guess is probably more than happens in the original play).  I couldn't stop laughing while reading this story.<br /><br />The rest of the stories in No Limits are range from fairly good to pretty good.  Some of the stories seem quite inconsequential while others obviously set up parts of the book series.  For me, the least interesting stories were \\"Redemption,\\" about the origins of the god of the Redeemers, Xant, and Terri Osborne's \\"Q'uandry,\\" where Dr. Selar meets the female Q entity from the Voyager television series.  Osborne's writing was fine, and tried to salvage the story, but it used one of my least favourite episodes from the series (the Q civil war) and was based on the in-joke that Selar and the female Q were played by the same person.  It just didn't grab me.  Xant's story might have if I were more familiar with the Redeemers.<br /><br />Ultimately, I am glad that I read No Limits.  I may have to reread it once I have caught up on the books, to see if it resonates a little more with me.  On the other hand, I was gifted with being able to read some good stories by a lot of the current crop of Trek writers, in addition to a few I had never known before.

One of the many questions Star Trek fans were asking during the long Dominion War arc of \\"Deep Space Nine\\" was \\"What was the Enterprise doing during all of this?\\"  Some of those questions were answered in a couple of other novels, as well as the movie Insurrection.  But what about Counselor Deanna Troi's homeworld of Betazed?  I remember the astonished feeling when I heard that it had been taken over by the Dominion, and I knew there had to be a story there.  This brings us to Charlotte Douglas and Susan Kearney's The Battle of Betazed, where Counselor Troi is forced to come to terms with what her people may have to become in order to rid their world of the Dominion.  Unfortunately, the book has horrible pacing and is quite pedestrian all the way around.<br /><br />Betazed has fallen to the Dominion and the Cardassian forces, and a new space station is being built in its orbit, similar to Deep Space Nine.  The Resistance movement on the planet is running dangerously low on food and resources and isn't causing much damage.  They are in desperate need of relief, but an entire fleet of Federation ships is destroyed in an attempt to retake the planet.  Why is the Dominion investing so many resources into protecting it?  What horrible crime is one Cardassian, Crell Moset, committing in the name of scientific discovery?  The Enterprise is sent on a desperate mission to free a man who may do more harm to Betazoid culture than the Dominion is doing, even as they discover what the horrible result of Moset's experiments might be.  If he succeeds, it may spell the end of the Federation and the beginning of ultimate Dominion victory.<br /><br />Sounds exciting, doesn't it?  Ok, maybe my description doesn't do it justice.  However, the back cover blurb does make the book sound very interesting.  Unfortunately, Douglas and Kearney don't succeed in making the *book* interesting.  It takes forever to get going (at least as a percentage of its very short length).  We get a lot of Troi angst, as she has to decide whether to go through with a mission that could bring down the Betazoid culture she's trying so desperately to save.  After a while, the angst just got tedious.  We spend a lot of time getting to know Elias Vaughn.  Even if this is his first appearance (I'm not up on the publishing dates of all the books he has appeared in), we spend way too long learning about him.  There's also the predictable friction between the Cardassian in charge of the occupation and the Vorta who oversees everything.  Add to this Moset's insanity, which gets demonstrated way too often, and it all boils down to a lot of set up.<br /><br />When the action finally does start, the authors do a decent job of describing it.  The starship battles are kind of interesting, though not exactly logical at times.  The Enterprise and its support ships go into battle vastly overmatched, with all parties wondering if *anybody* will get out alive, but then everything suddenly becomes too easy.  Meanwhile, the action down at the prison, where Troi, Vaughn, Crusher and Data are, is also illogical.  The party happens upon a Jem'Hadar patrol and manages to talk them into letting them go despite not having their identification cards.  The Jem'Hadar *I* know would have just shot them on sight if they were the least bit out of line.  My last complaint has Troi managing to stun somebody holding Data prisoner by firing *through* Data.  I'm sorry, but if your phaser shot burned a hole through an android, there's no way it's going to only stun the target behind him.<br /><br />While the prose and characterization is somewhat pedestrian (Moset is very stereotypical of the single-minded scientist), there are a few nice scenes here and there that seem to set up what happens in the Insurrection movie.  Riker and Troi seem to grow closer together as he helps her deal with the weight of what her people might have to do to survive.  Especially nice is the final scene between them (though I can't go into detail, because of spoilers).  The plot itself is fairly interesting (despite the logic flaws in some cases).  There's only one major coincidence, and while it's a doozy, it's still forgivable given everything else.  The final solution doesn't come out of left field and is, in fact, quite good.  It's not a perfect solution, unlike a lot of plot resolutions.  It has its price.  Unfortunately, the price that we expect that Troi will have to pay after what happens doesn't come to pass, as she's let off the hook by developments.  It's a shame when that happens, as that really would have grown her character.<br /><br />One final compliment to the book.  The characterization of Lwaxana Troi (Deanna's mother, for those of you not in the know) is actually very nice.  She's one of the leaders of the local resistance cell, and while she is not unrecognizable, all of the changes that the invasion and four months of occupation have wrought have taken their toll on her.  She still has a couple of bantering comments with Picard, but you can tell they are just old habit and her heart's not in it.  It's wonderful stuff, and unfortunately she is underused (and anybody who knows my Trek reviews knows how much I hate the character, so that's really a compliment).<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm glad I read The Battle of Betazed, as it's good to know what happened (it's referred to in some subsequent books, especially Articles of the Federation).  It's a very quick read, so you won't waste much time on it.  I just wish it had been as interesting as the description promised it would be.

US	50332419	R35CI91YICTUN6	1416500154	342728349	Articles of the Federation (Star Trek: the Next Generation)	Books	5	10	12	N	N	So *this* is how Federation politics works!	Political Trek, eh?  Most Star Trek books deal with a Starfleet ship or station and the various crises that they encounter.  Articles of the Federation is basically \\"The West Wing in Trek.\\"  Sounds like it might not be that interesting, right?  However, this one is written by Keith R.A. DeCandido, the master Trek novel writer, so it was definitely worth a shot.  And besides, politics can be interesting too, can't they?  I'm happy to say that they can certainly be not only interesting, but fascinating.  It helps that the author has a cool president character, the talent to write great characterization of myriad people, and the memory of an elephant for Trek continuity.<br /><br />In A Time for War, A Time for Peace, Nan Bacco was elected president of the Federation.  Articles of the Federation is the story of her first year in office.  And what a full plate she has.  The Romulan situation, as left in Titan: Taking Wing, is starting to deteriorate, as a ship full of Reman refugees approaches an outlying starbase.  A first contact diplomatic mission goes awry in a very public manner.  The Federation Council makes things even more difficult for her to get legislation through, and a large number of people keep seeing her as a lowly planetary governor, too small for such an immense office.  The final capper, though, is when what really happened on Tezwa, as instigated by her predecessor, comes home to roost.  If that gets out, there will be nothing stopping yet another galactic war.<br /><br />Bacco is DeCandido's creation, and you can tell that he really loves writing her character.  She is a fully-formed, three-dimensional creation who just springs off the page.  She's also the unifying force in this book, as even when she's not \\"on screen,\\" the events happening are going to have a great impact on what she does and who she is.  She's pragmatic, willing to strong-arm two planets into negotiations by threatening to go to war with one of them (pretty much an empty threat, but she makes it believable).  She loves the newly revived game of baseball, religiously following the teams in the league on her home planet, and even arranging a publicity tour in such a way that she's available to throw out the first pitch of the season.  She's quick with a sarcastic remark, especially to her chief of staff, Esperanza Piniero, who gives it right back to her.  Their relationship is also wonderful to read about, as their friendship that goes back decades really deepens both of their characters.<br /><br />While these two are the main characters, the book has so many other characters that you would think they'd all start looking the same after a while.  That's not so in any DeCandido book.  Even those who are only in the book for a short while still have a feeling of depth to them.  There are many policy advisors and other governmental positions in the book, and those characters' names do start to run together after a while, but not their personalities.  How DeCandido manages to keep them all straight, I'll never know.  But he does.  Various other characters pop in to fill their small roles (Spock, Scotty, Chancellor Martok, Voyager's Doctor, to name just four), but their appearances never seem choreographed for a \\"Wow\\" factor, instead feeling absolutely necessary.<br /><br />This brings me to continuity, as the book is literally brimming with it.  In the past, I have been on DeCandido's back about the excessive continuity and how his explanations of it have ground a book to a halt.  Surprisingly, in a book this continuity-heavy, he largely avoids this.  All references are perfunctory, with just enough explanation to give the reader an idea of what happened and just enough information to make clear whatever the characters who mention it are doing about it.  To help those who are still confused, he has created a page of annotations, saying who these characters are and where these events took place.<br /><br />In fact, this book is not slow at all.  Yes, there is no \\"action\\" in it (unless you consider the wheels of politics and diplomacy as action), but it still grips the reader all the same.  Every two month period of Bacco's first year is given its own section, and each section is opened with somebody watching one of those news analysis show like you see on CNN or Fox News, with \\"experts,\\" journalists, and former politicians or military officers as guests.  This sets the stage for what is going to happen, as well as reacting to what has already occurred.  I thought this was an ingenious way to move things along and let us see how the outside world thinks about what Bacco is doing.  The only one that felt a little forced was the opening one, but otherwise these flowed very nicely.<br /><br />The book is certainly not flawless.  Bacco is a bit too flippant at times (such as in council or diplomatic meetings).  I had trouble keeping the advisors straight occasionally, and a couple of the in-jokes just made me scratch my head until I heard the explanation of them (Martok saying that the Romulan Praetor sounds just like his wife comes completely out of left field and pulled me out of the book wondering until I discovered that the same actress played both characters).  However, these are so small that they quickly disappeared as I went deeper and deeper into the book.  I was fascinated by everything and had trouble putting the book down.  It's dense for a Trek book, but that just made it all the more enjoyable.  While you certainly don't have to have read any of the \\"A Time to\\" books, Articles of the Federation has a lot more impact if you have.  It's a wonderful continuation of the Trek mythos, and you could enjoy it even if you don't like political books.<br /><br />David Royat all.

US	50332419	R2BNE2W6U67UEF	0743491513	970142147	Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Hollow Men	Books	5	26	32	N	N	Dark secrets come home to roost	Hollow Men, by Una McCormack, is one of those \\"love it or hate it\\" types of novels.  It's a Star Trek: Deep Space Nine story that takes place during the series itself (as opposed to afterwards, as the latest DS9 books have been).  In the series episode, \\"In the Pale Moonlight,\\" Captain Sisko had to go against all of his ethics in order to trick the Romulans into joining the Dominion War, as the Federation was losing.  The situation spiraled out of control until he was guilty of countenancing murder in order to get the job done.  Hollow Men is the aftermath, and it's told in McCormack's normal style.  Not many \\"events\\" occur, and the book lives or dies on whether you believe in (and are intrigued by) the characterizations and the internal aspects of the plot. Me?  I loved it.  But your mileage may vary.<br /><br />After the events of the television episode, Sisko is on his way back to Earth to attend a conference, the first one that the Romulans will be a part of.  Starfleet Intelligence wants Garak, the Cardassian tailor and ex-spy who performed most of the skullduggery, to come along.  Sisko is being eaten up by guilt for his actions, trying desperately to justify them internally but hating himself more and more, and this carries over to Garak.  Garak, of course, is concerned that Sisko will break and confess everything, and he's certain he's going to end up in a Federation prison.  When they get to Earth, however, they get wrapped up in more intrigue, as an ex-starfleet officer turned peace activist becomes even more important to the entire war effort, and secrets that should never be revealed are in danger of coming out.<br /><br />McCormack is the author of the Cardassian story in The Worlds of Bajor: Volume One, which I happened to love.  Her characterization of Garak was dead-on in that story, and she captures him very well in this one too.  His sarcasm and general wit are evident, but we also see his cunning and his intelligence.  When he gets wrapped up in the Starfleet Intelligence plot, he is determined to follow his own path to finish the job, and he will even refuse to do the job if he doesn't like what he finds out.  He's calm under pressure, he knows what torture is like and so is ready when he's about to be on the other end of it than he's used to.  I especially loved his reactions to the peace protests when Sisko takes him to one of them.  He honestly can't believe that such a protest would be allowed during war time, and thinks back longingly to the days on Cardassia where stuff like this would be stamped out immediately.  He has plenty of traditionally Garak quips.  Basically, if you like Garak, you should love this book.<br /><br />Sisko's guilt is also extremely well done.  Even better is his reaction when he doesn't get the reaction he quite expected upon revealing what happened.  He searches desperately for something to salve his conscience, and while this might seem out of character for the Sisko we know, to me it seemed realistic for a man who has transgressed his principles as far as he has.  He knows what happened was necessary, but he feels like he should be punished.  The various attempts he makes to get that to happen are excellent, ending in a wonderful discussion with the one person who he can depend on to talk him through this.<br /><br />There is also a story that takes place on DS9, involving Odo and a shipment of latinum (the main currency outside of the Federation).  This plotline isn't as interesting as the main one, and it doesn't even tie into the main story until the end (in a way that, admittedly, comes out of left field a little bit, and is my only real problem with the book).  All of the characters are well done, but there wasn't that much to really grab me until near the middle of the book.  Some people have claimed that a fault with the book is that nothing happens for long periods of time.  While this is true, I found myself so fascinated with the Sisko and Garak storyline, and interested enough in the station plot that I didn't really notice.<br /><br />I said that Hollow Men was a \\"love it or hate it\\" type of book, and basically it boils down to whether or not you like McCormack's style.  So far, she's written two novels for the Star Trek line, and both of them have been more internal books with events taking place as conversations between characters that advance the plot, or dealing with issues rather than events.  I think that she does a lovely job getting you into the minds of the characters, and enough happens that I'm not bored by them.  There is always some action later on in the story, and this book is no exception.  But she takes great pains to set up the action, making sure the action stems from the characters rather than just throwing in a random battle or two.  Occasionally, the set up drags too long, as with the story on the station here, and it threatens to lose the reader.  But I could hear Avery Brooks (Sisko) and Andrew Robinson (Garak) speak a lot of the lines she gives them, and they carry their sections even before anything actually happens in the story.<br /><br />Overall, Hollow Men is an excellent entry in the Deep Space Nine saga.  If you've read McCormack's previous book, your opinion of that will probably determine whether you agree with me here.  However, I can definitely say that this book is worth a try, especially if you're a fan of our favourite Cardassian tailor.  This one is up near the top of my Trek book list for 2005.<br /><br />David Royterested enough in the station plot that I didn't really notice. <br /> <br />I said that Hollow Men was a \\"love it or hate it\\" type of book, and basically it boils down to whether or not you like McCormack's style.

US	50332419	RR26T2C6S6CWW	0060554827	534832855	No Man's Land	Books	4	4	6	N	N	A death trek across the western United States	(Warning: a plot detail from the previous book, Red Tide, is revealed in the first paragraph)<br /><br />In No Man's Land, by G.M. Ford, Frank Corso is finally on his own.  In Red Tide, his companion, Meg Dougherty, finally left him for good.  I found Red Tide to be a great book with one of its only faults being the way that Meg leaves.  While her presence is definitely missed in No Man's Land, Ford manages to make the book gripping despite it.  This book also continues where Red Tide left off in how we get into the minds of other characters as well as Corso, which enriches this book enormously.  While it is still not perfect, Ford has written another gripping thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />There has been a riot at a privately-run maximum security prison in Arizona.  The leader of the inmates, Timothy Driver, has a special request.  He wants Frank Corso to come to the prison, or he will have a guard killed every six hours. It seems that Corso wrote a book about the murders Driver committed, and Driver wants him to come along for the rest of his story and write the truth. This riot also attracts the attention of Melanie Harris, of American Manhunt, who races down to Arizona after being informed of this big news story, as ratings have been going down for a while.  When Corso finally shows up, he finds a situation much more fluid then he imagined.  Driver, a fellow inmate named Kehoe, and Corso escape from the prison and a massive manhunt begins.  What is Driver's ultimate purpose in involving Corso in all this?  Does he want to go out in a blaze of glory documented by the only writer Driver trusts?  Or is there another motive involved?  And will Corso survive to tell the tale?<br /><br />No Man's Land claims to be a \\"cross-country journey\\" for Corso, but it turns out to just be a few western states.  Still, Ford has once again branched beyond his native Seattle, and this time it doesn't feel as forced as it did in A Blind Eye, when the Midwest didn't really feel like the Midwest.  This time, it feels more natural, as they travel from the deserts of Arizona to the mountains of Nevada and beyond.  However, that could be because I'm not as familiar with that environment as I am the Midwest.  Still, Ford seems to do a great job with the setting.<br /><br />The best things about Ford's books are usually the characters, and he doesn't disappoint here, with a few odd exceptions.  Corso is, of course, wonderfully done.  It's unclear how long it's been since Meg left, but he clearly still misses her at the beginning of the book, and she even pops up in his mind occasionally during everything else.  He's still the same man, though, always looking out for the underdog and not taking any grief from the higher authorities.  His relationship with the FBI in this one is typically rough, and it predictably causes some dangerous situations as he is not believed when he finally does try and call them in.  His relationship with Melanie is a little more unusual, as we're not used to seeing him in a casual fling (Meg has been around since the beginning for the reader of the series), but it does seem to develop in a natural fashion (at least as far as Corso is concerned).<br /><br />Melanie is a bit more of a mixed bag.  She's set up to be a mirror image of John Walsh (American Manhunt is basically America's Most Wanted), though she is given a few different characteristics (besides the obvious fact that she's a woman).  When her daughter was killed, she began a crusade in a similar fashion as Walsh, ending up with the show.  Unfortunately, she dragged her husband along with all this as she became a media star, but he's withdrawn into himself and doesn't want any part of this.  Her time in Los Angeles has seen a chasm form between the two of them, and he moves back to Wisconsin while she's on assignment in Arizona.  I kept wondering how much of her character was based on Walsh (just the history of a murdered child, orsome of the subsequent events too?).  On a side note, I was also a little uncomfortable with Ford stating that Samantha's death and Melanie's crusading resulted in the Amber Alert system.  In a fictionalized world like this, I believe he should have called it something else, as the Amber Alert was named for a real Amber, and not changing the name seems to trivialize Amber's death a little bit (besides making it very odd that it's still called \\"Amber\\" instead of \\"Samantha\\").<br /><br />Ford gets into the mind of the villain, Driver, very well, but he spends a little too much time there.  Fans of Corso may find that he's not in the book enough, as we see things from Driver's point of view, Melanie's, and a few other bit characters.  It's kind of fun to see the FBI agents and their internal reactions to Corso (rather than just what Corso himself sees), but I did miss Corso at times, wishing he'd come back onto the scene.  Driver's motivation isn't firmly established either.  The reason that seems to be given at the end of the book (which, of course, I won't tell you) doesn't indicate why Corso is so important to him, especially as he keeps insisting to Koher that Corso can't be killed because he has to tell Driver's story.  It just didn't seem complete, especially given the way the book does finally end.<br /><br />Even with that, though, No Man's Land will keep you turning the page, especially if you're already a fan of Corso's.  Ford's dialogue is always wonderful, and he avoids the political statements that Red Tide was filled with.  The plot is intriguing (even if Driver's motivation doesn't really work) and the characterization is great.  No Man's Land is another winner.<br /><br />David Royn a side note, I was also a little uncomfortable with Ford stating that Samantha's death and Melanie's crusading resulted in the Amber Alert system.

As you may remember from the movie Nemesis, William Riker, first officer of the Enterprise, married his long-time love, Deanna Troi, and was all set to take command of the USS Titan before the battle with Shinzon occurred.  Now, in Taking Wing, he has taken command, and they are ready to go on their first mission.  Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels do a great job of both introducing an almost totally new crew as well as getting the ship off on its maiden voyage.  While it does take a bit of time to get started and not all of the characterization is that great, the book is definitely a great read, and I look forward to future Titan books.<br /><br />Captain Riker has a lot to deal with on his first mission.  His choice for first officer has reservations about Riker's wife being on the command staff (Troi is the ship's counselor as well as its Chief Diplomatic Officer).  The Titan is the most culturally and biologically diverse ship in Starfleet, so a lot of accommodation has to be given, both physically and socially.  Some ship's quarters have to be refit for its crew, such as a low-gravity berth for Lt. Melora Pazlar, from a planet with very low gravity.  The new Chief Medical Officer unintentionally frightens some of the crew, or at least makes them uncomfortable.  Still, this is his first command, and they are going on a mission of exploration, a great change from all of the military work that Starfleet has been carrying out the last four years since the Dominion War.  Unfortunately, that mission is put on hold as the Titan is assigned to escort a relief convoy to the Romulan homeworld as unrest from Shinzon's abortive coup in Nemesis threatens to explode into civil war.  Riker, instead of exploring, must tip-toe through a diplomatic minefield, along with his wife, or war could again be coming to the Romulan empire, perhaps exploding into the Federation.<br /><br />The Titan is the most diverse ship in the fleet.  Yes, I know I'm repeating myself.  However, I am only taking after the book, which seems to mention it almost every chapter.  This diversity does make for some interesting situations, such as the new first officer (I won't say who it is, because the series leading up to Titan takes great pains to hide who becomes Riker's first officer) having to dress down a crewmember for making derogatory generalizations against both the Klingons and the Romulans.  In fact, the books does go overboard with this (the aforementioned scene being a good example).  I think the diversity of the characters goes along way in showing us this without actually having to be told about it all the time.<br /><br />That being said, the rest of the book is very good.  Riker's first meeting with the reptilian Dr. Ree is classic, his interactions with Deanna are very natural, both professionally and personally.  There is some concern in some quarters about Riker having his wife on his senior staff, and whether he would be able to be objective when it comes to Troi in a dangerous situation.  Riker handles it beautifully, though it remains to be seen if he can do it the way he talked about.  In fact, Riker is probably handled the best he has been in quite a while.  The same goes for Troi.  The highlight of the book, however, is the mixture of old and new faces.  A few faces have been seen before on the Enterprise or in previous books, while others are brand new.  Dr. Ree is probably the best of the new bunch, with his reptilian features masking a very gentle soul.  He has a gentle humour that I hope gets developed in future Titan books.  Nurse Ogawa, one of the older faces from the Enterprise, gets some good development too.<br /><br />With introducing a new crew, sometimes the plot can get sidetracked.  Thankfully, that's not the case in this one.  There is a lot of Romulan intrigue, with four different factions vying for controlof the Empire, and Riker having to make sure he doesn't set off an interstellar incident.  We get to see both Riker's diplomatic skills as well as his tactical skills as things start to go a bit too far.  Riker ends up with a novel solution to the whole thing.  Being a big Romulan fan, *this* is the book I have been waiting for (as those who have seen my complaints about both Nemesis and Captain's Blood can probably attest).  The Tal Shiar (the Romulan secret intelligence agency) is well-represented, we see progress in Spock's \\"Vulcan-Romulan reunification\\" plan (not much, maybe, but there are developments), and we see the Romulan military in action.

The Shadows of God, the conclusion of J. Gregory Keyes' \\"Age of Unreason\\" series, is a thrilling ride through war, mysticism, and a little bit of love.  The characters have been through a lot in the last 15 years or so, and this is the culmination of everything.  While the ending is not quite as good as I would have hoped, Keyes still manages to keep the reader intrigued, racing to the end to see exactly how it turns out.  While not completely unpredictable, there is enough uncertainty for the story to keep a hold of the reader.<br /><br />Ben Franklin has finally made it to the French court in the New Orleans area, where the former Duke of Orleans is now the only remaining French king.  He's trying desperately to set up an alliance among all of the former colonies.  Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to hem the colonies in on the west while English troops come from the east.  The demon-like Malekim, are making their final play for dominion on the Earth, and if humans manage to even come close to stopping them, they will unleash a horror that has never been seen before.  The key to everything could end up being Adrienne de Montchevreuil, a French sorceress who may know more science than Franklin and more magic than Red Shoes, the Choctaw shaman who may or may not be on the side of good.  Will they all be able to stop the Malekim while there is still enough left of the colonies to celebrate the victory?<br /><br />This entire series has been a fascinating alternate history with sorcery and alchemy playing a major part and historical figures we're all familiar with mixing with characters that Keyes has made up.  The Shadows of God continues this, though the story has gone so much more beyond alternate history that it is almost unrecognizable.  Instead, it's a fantasy with historical trappings, with Franklin, Tsar Peter, and Voltaire being the only recognizable historical figures left.  This is not a bad thing, as Keyes once again does a wonderful job of characterization.  I said in my review of Empire of Unreason that Red Shoes had become thoroughly uninteresting.  This time, however, Keyes succeeds in grabbing the reader's attention with him again.  He's fighting an evil that he has absorbed within him, that has caused him to do terrible things.  How he deals with this, with the help of Grief, his lover, made me want to read his sections of the book again (unlike the earlier book).<br /><br />Once again, Franklin and Adrienne are also extremely well-done.  Also well done is Oglethorpe, the general of the colonial armies who are fighting the invading English and Russian troops.  He shows a lot of intelligence in his battle tactics, using the resources that he has been given (a couple of airships, some magical guns) to their utmost.  He's also learned to deal with his prejudices and command a mixed group of men (escaped and freed slaves, Native Americans, and some colonists).  Before leading the army, he had been a slaveowner, but the escaped slaves become some of his best scouts, and it's interesting to see the change in his perception as he sheds his English sensibilities and becomes an \\"American.\\"<br /><br />I really like how Keyes has created a number of interesting characters, but he resists the urge to get inside all of their heads.  For most of the first three books, the only viewpoint characters have been Franklin, Adrienne, and Red Shoes (Red Shoes being introduced in A Calculus of Angels).  Oglethorpe is introduced in Empire of Unreason and also becomes a viewpoint character, but that is it.  Instead, Keyes manages to show us what's inside the characters by their actions and words, rather than thoughts.  The king of New France is a great example of this.  We can tell that he is horrified about what has happened to his old country, and he certainly doesn't want the responsibility of bringing New France up by its bootstraps, but he is a patriot and willing to do whatever is necessary for the good of his people.  He lovesscience but can be blinded by his subordinates when it comes to politics.  All of the characters are three-dimensional despite us not being able to hear what they think.<br /><br />The only exception to this, and it leads into the other fault with the book, are Tsar Peter and Charles, King of Sweden.  Peter gets a little more characterization when he's rescued, but once the final battle begins and Charles shows up (his sworn enemy), they become nothing but bluster and ultimately the interest plummets.  The results of their final battle are completely predictable (only the magnitude of what happens is in question).  Their characterization is a symptom of the fact that the ending just becomes one huge battle with flashes of characterization from a few sources.  There's nothing wrong with having a big battle at the end of a book, and Keyes does a decent job describing the action, but it seemed like a sidebar to the mystical element of the story, giving the characters something to drive them to the conclusion rather than something to care about itself.  We're already told that the Malekim will do something drastic if their human pawns' plans are defeated, so dramatically the battle doesn't really serve a lot of purpose.<br /><br />That being said, The Shadows of God is still riveting for the most part, and a fitting conclusion to the entire story.  The ending, while slightly predictable, leaves things in an interesting way.  It doesn't call for a sequel at all.  Instead, it's more of a \\"these characters have a lot of work ahead of them\\" feeling.  It's satisfying to see the old friends you've been reading about for four books finally getting a rest.  At least those who survive, at any rate.<br /><br />David RoyHe loves science but can be blinded by his subordinates when it comes to politics.

Gregory Keyes keeps the momentum going in the third book of the Age of Unreason series, Empire of Unreason.  The first two books were an excellent mix of historical and original characters all in a fantastic alternate history of alchemy and religion.  This one, the third in the series, takes place ten years after A Calculus of Angels and is a bit less complete then the first two books.  That's not to say it's missing anything, but it does end on a bit of a cliffhanger, which they didn't.<br /><br />Ten years after the battle with Russia's Peter the Great in Venice, a lot has changed in the world.  Ben Franklin is back in the Americas, the local alchemist in Charles Town as well as head of a secret group of scientists who are working to defeat the Malekim, sinister figures who might pass as demons or unruly angels to the non-scientific mind.  They are trying to get mankind to eradicate itself, or at least stop meddling in scientific pursuits that they feel are their own domain.  Meanwhile, Adrienne is in St. Petersburg where she was taken by Tsar Peter, but Peter is now missing and she is under threat from those who would take over for him.  She's also searching for her kidnapped son, who it turns out may be the evil that defeats them all.  Only a Choctaw Indian named Red Shoes may be able to stop them.  With the colonies in America under assault from a Russian backed English king, Franklin must endeavor to convince the disparate governments in North America to join together and fight back, though it may all be for naught.<br /><br />Keyes continues his excellent characterization, with all of his main characters being fully developed and interesting to read about.  Adrienne is a mother who is despairing about her son, especially once she learns who he may really be.  She's been allied to the Malekim at some point, but she realizes exactly what they are doing and that she must do her part to fight them, with the aid of some factions of the Malekim who aren't necessarily after mankind's destruction.  She's very narrow-minded, refusing to offer her lover much more than her bed and scorning most any other offers of friendship except for Crecy, her faithful companion and defender.<br /><br />Franklin is once again Keyes' masterpiece, as he is torn between the woman he loves but has neglected for the last ten years and the task he knows he has to do.  He does his utmost to keep Lenka out of any danger, but she bristles under his protection, thinking he's excluding her and putting her aside for his science.  Keyes portrays Franklin as somebody who loves women but can't seem to understand them.  He's not very knowledgeable about love and he feels trapped by his duty anyway.  The reader feels for him after each conversation with his wife, as we see her drift further and further away from him.<br /><br />The only misstep in characterization, and it is minor, is Red Shoes.  While he was fairly interesting in A Calculus of Angels, he went downhill in this one.  His character is the most mystic of all of them (though Adrienne is close), and Keyes doesn't really ground him in the real world that well to make him appealing.  He certainly tries, but doesn't quite succeed.  Late in the book, something happens that makes Red Shoes more of a tragic figure, but I found by this point that I didn't really care that much.  I wanted the action to get back to Franklin or Adrienne (or even Oglethorpe, who is a new character introduced in this book).<br /><br />Still, that is really the only \\"bad\\" part of the book.  Keyes' prose is once again serviceable, though the dialogue is at times a bit questionable (most of these are in the Red Shoes sequences, so perhaps that's why they were questionable compared to the rest).  He hadn't quite reached the level he's now at in The Kingdoms of Throne & Bone series, but it is still quite good.  There is a lot more action in this book, with war coming to the colonies, flying airships powered by the Malekim facingoff against the fledgling government of the Americas, the colonists outnumbered and outgunned, but they are slowly becoming united.  Oglethorpe is fighting a rearguard action while Franklin is trying to enlist allies, unaware that the mystic war is coming at them from the western part of the continent as well as the east.  Keyes' descriptions of the battles are extremely vivid and interesting to read about.<br /><br />Empire of Unreason also avoids the faults of the previous books, which is definitely a good thing.  He no longer (or at least, much less noticeably) begins chapters in the middle of the action and has the characters either tell or hear about what happened before.  There are far fewer coincidences involved in this book as well with everything having a good reason for happening besides trying to get all of the characters together.  Too bad that every time Keyes fixes a flaw, something else creeps in, but it is impossible for a book to be perfect.<br /><br />All in all, Empire of Unreason is yet another winner for Keyes, and I can't wait for the conclusion to see how it all wraps up.<br /><br />David Royim facing off against the fledgling government of the Americas, the colonists outnumbered and outgunned, but they are slowly becoming united.

US	50332419	R2TX3G89LUO7AM	0143035754	973558666	The Hollow Crown: A History of Britain in the Late Middle Ages	Books	3	52	56	N	N	Interesting historical information, needs water though.	There's a minor misstep in Miri Rubin's The Hollow Crown: A History of Britain in the Late Middle Ages.  Perhaps it's a problem with the entire Penguin History of Britain collection, I'm not sure, as I haven't read any other examples.  The problem is a matter of audience:  as in, I can't really tell what audience it's for.  The preface states that it's intended not primarily for historians, but for those \\"historians\\" outside the universities.  These would be people like curators of museums, history teachers in the public schools, those guarding historical sites, and those who publish amateur research, that sort of thing.  It also seems to be intended as history for the general public, those who may have an interest in history but aren't really experts in it.  This is all well and good, but the problem is that the book is way too dry for the layman and the information is probably already known to a great deal of amateur historians.<br /><br />Thus, the book seems to miss its target and be the wrong thing to the wrong people.  The Hollow Crown has a great deal of detailed information about life in Great Britain from 1307 to 1485.  It covers everything from daily serf life to how churches greatly influenced the daily life of both commoners and the nobility.  It covers economics, agriculture, politics, and everything in between.  For the historian who is just starting out, there is a lot of good information about British daily life in this book, and it becomes a valuable informational tool for the beginner.  It could also be greatly useful for any writer who wants to set a book in this time period, as there is a lot of background information that would make a setting seem realistic.  That was actually the first thing that occurred to me as I was reading it.<br /><br />The book is divided into chapters separated by the monarch at the time (the only chapter containing two monarchs is the one dealing with Henry IV and Henry V, but there is a reason for that.  Their rules were so much the same in exploits and aims that they almost must be studied together. Thus, we get to see how life was different under each of these kings.  Probably most interesting, Rubin provides us with the political fall-out (both by the nobility and the common man) when a king is deposed rather than chosen as an heir (Henry the IV was a prime example of that).  Rubin is at her most interesting when she is talking about the politics of the day, and I found that the book picked up my interest level when she was talking about them.<br /><br />Of course, learning about the daily life of these people can be interesting too, but here Rubin falls down a bit.  These sections are very dry, and while she is imparting good information, they were a real struggle to get through.  Each aspect of life gets its own section within the chapter, and she uses a lot of information she gathered from local records.  These records could be on food production (what was grown and exported where) or they could be marriage records or other ecclesiastical court documents.  She discusses the role of the clergy, both in religious instruction and legal matters, and about how some peasants grew tired of the constant corruption in the churches at times.  Rubin tries to tie these sections together and relate them to each other, but a lot of times it just seems like Rubin's listing a bunch of things to illustrate her point and then she moves on to the next one.  I can almost see her say, \\"Ok, I've got food production done.  Now on to the clergy, and then local courts.\\"  It doesn't help that her prose style doesn't really make these sections grab your attention, though she does try.<br /><br />Each chapter starts with an introduction, giving a general overview of that monarch's reign.  Rubin then leaves the king for the moment, except where he (or his queen) had an impact on daily life (such as a section on Edward III and chivalry).  She then ends the chapters detailing the politics of the king, various foreign adventures he had and what he did with his monarchy before dying (or being deposed, as two of them were).  These sections on the king are the most interesting of the bunch, as we see how Britain related to the rest of the world (which we also do when Rubin discusses trade, but that's not as interesting).  As the turbulence of the late 1400s hits, the book becomes almost fascinating, as she covers a lot of the political intrigue that took place during the Wars of the Roses (which term, interestingly, she only uses once, and this is when she says that Shakespeare christened the dynastic wars \\"the Wars of the Roses\\").  She also glosses over the Richard III controversy, pertaining to the killing of the two young princes.  She says that he was blamed for it, but she doesn't come down on one side or the other.<br /><br />The Hollow Crown is obviously well-researched, and Rubin works very hard to show it.  While there are no footnotes or end notes, she does provide a chapter-by-chapter list \\"essay on further reading\\" for the most heavily used sources, and she provides a complete bibliography of her sources on her web site.  This is actually the first time I've ever seen something like that, where the author actually tells you to go to a web site for more complete information on the book you are reading, but I guess it is a sign of the times.  Seeing as the book is already quite long, I can see why enclosing a complete bibliography in the book itself would be difficult.<br /><br />Overall, am glad I read The Hollow Crown, but it was a chore to get through at times.  Rubin's style (or maybe it's the content) doesn't really lend itself to popular reading and I almost put it down once or twice.  But I did ultimately find myself reading to the end and finding the information valuable.  I just wish the reading experience itself had been more pleasurable.<br /><br />David Roy, various foreign adventures he had and what he did with his monarchy before dying (or being deposed, as two of them were).

Mary Gentle is widely known for what I like to call \\"historical fantasy.\\" 1610: A Sundial in a Grave barely meets the definition of fantasy or science fiction, with the only fantastic element being the fact that mathematical precognition is a reality. She's also known as a meticulous researcher, and she shows that again in this book. 1610 is a wonderful book that just starts a little too slow.<br /><br />1610 is a year of change. Edward Fludd has perfected the mathematics of telling the future. However, he doesn't like what he sees, so he determines to change it. This is the year where that change becomes possible. Valentin Rochefort, a duellist and down on his luck aristocrat, as well as servant to the French spymaster Sully, is having his own problems. He is supposed to set up the assassination of his monarch, Henry IV, but it's designed to be a fake. Too bad for him that it happens to succeed. Disgraced and forced to run, he encounters his nemesis, Dariole, who revels in humiliating him, especially by being 16 years old and able to beat him at swordplay. Dariole ends up running with him, and they both find themselves trapped in Fludd's web. Fludd intends to use Rochefort in an assassination of his own, one that will change the future the way he wants it to be. With the addition of a shipwrecked Japanese samurai, agendas clash, different honor systems conflict, and secrets are revealed. The story goes all over the world, from France to England to Portugal and then to Japan before returning for an intriguing finish. There's even time for a little romance as well.<br /><br />1610 is written as if it were a computer-generated reconstructed translation of a fire-damaged manuscript written by Rochefort. This allows the \\"translator\\" to include other documents as well, so each part (the book is separated into five) begins with something other than his memoirs. Sometimes it's a translator's note or a partially reconstructed entry from Saburo to his Japanese liege-lord. These give us a little bit more background information that Rochefort wouldn't necessarily be privy to, enabling the reader to have a more well-rounded story. It's an effective way to write, and Rochefort makes a wonderful narrator. He's witty and he's not afraid to admit his own mistakes (and there are many). The only thing that's not completely realistic about this is that there is no white-washing whatsoever. There's no effort to make Rochefort look good, which is what would probably happen with anybody else's memoirs. Rochefort's honesty is refreshing, however.<br /><br />With the book being told in first person, it would have been very easy to make the other characters wooden. Thankfully, Gentle avoids this, with both Dariole and Saburo being superb. The relationship between Dariole and Rochefort is riveting, especially when Dariole's secret is revealed and Rochefort has to adjust. Saburo is fascinating because Japan is an unknown entity at this point, with just a few western explorers having been there. The culture clash between Saburo and Rochefort, and even Dariole to an extent (though Dariole seems a lot more willing to learn from Saburo, being only 16 and impressionable) makes a good subplot to the main action. It gets even more interesting when Saburo has to choose between duty to his leader and duty to the man who saved his life. Gentle handles all of these differing cultures admirably, showing again how detailed her research is.<br /><br />The only bad thing I have to say about the book is that the beginning is horribly slow. I almost gave up on it after 60 pages, especially when a bizarre sexual encounter took place. I was beginning to wonder if this is the type of book that I'm not interested in reading. I persevered, though, and discovered a rich, yet clearly adult, novel with wonderful prose and fascinating characters. Once Rochefort and Dariole leave Paris, the book takes off at a frenetic yet leisurely pace. I know that doesn't appear to make sense,but the story seems to be moving even when Gentle is pausing for breath. 1610 is a book that's hard to put down, even during these breaks. When there's no action, there are still plenty of ideas being put forward, or beautiful character interaction to keep the reader entertained.<br /><br />I have to reiterate that this is definitely an adult novel. There are some sexual situations in it, as well as some adult concepts. As long as that doesn't bother you, 1610 is a wonderful book.<br /><br />David Roye sense, but the story seems to be moving even when Gentle is pausing for breath. 1610 is a book that's hard to put down, even during these breaks.

These have been outstanding novels, but the latest (The Hallowed Hunt) doesn't quite measure up.  It's still extraordinarily well-written and carried Bujold's trademark prose, but the interest level just wasn't there.  The characters weren't as intriguing as previous volumes go.<br /><br />Lord Ingrey kin Wolfcliff has been sent to a manor house where one of the king's sons has been brutally murdered.  The accused killer is a young noblewoman who had been in the service of lord Boleso's sister.  However, he had planned to use her in one of his unnatural rites, and she bludgeoned him, supposedly in self-defense.  Ingrey has been sent to bring her back to Easthome for trial.  However, he finds himself caught up in a web of politics and deceit, as the king is fading fast.  Ingrey must not only deal with his growing feelings for this young woman, but also the dark secrets of his own past, and how they link him with the current plot to wrest the Hallow Kingship from its rightful heir.  Ingrey will find that getting involved with the gods is not always a pleasant thing.<br /><br />First, I can tell you that this is a completely standalone novel.  No knowledge of the previous two books (The Curse of Chalion and Paladin of Souls) is required at all, as they have only established the world these characters live in.  In fact, this story takes place in a completely different country and it's unclear if it's even in the same time period.  That being said, I kind of missed the fact that there was no connection between these books.  That might have made some of the characters a little more interesting.  Instead, Bujold has to create everything from whole cloth, and she's not entirely successful.<br /><br />I find the whole concept of the five gods to be fascinating, and Bujold makes good use of it here.  We've seen the gods before, but we've never seen them in conflict with what's going on in the story.  Instead, usually they're either the catalyst for what's happening or they're working behind the scenes.  This time, the conflict is going against them, and it makes it even more interesting.  The story is also tragic when we find out what is truly going on with the Weald magic and a massacre committed a long time ago.  When Ingrey finds out the truth about his past and the role that he must now play in it, the story comes together very nicely.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it takes a while in getting there, and Bujold failed to make characters that gripped me in the meantime.  They aren't bad characters, and I did find them somewhat intriguing, but long passages of the book dragged where the characters involved didn't grab my attention at all.  It's hard to really say what was wrong with them, as overall, Ingrey and Ijada were good, I found them a bit overwritten at times.  I just wanted Bujold to get on with the story, which is unusual for me.  Bujold is usually a master of characterization, and her quiet scenes are usually some of the best, but not these.  Another time where the story dragged was Ingrey's first meeting and subsequent carousing with Jokol.  The entire scene on the ship, while amusing at times, just made me wish Bujold would get back to the story.  Yes, Jokol turns out to be important and so this scene was needed, but I didn't find him that interesting and wished the scene had been shorter.  Finally, Wencel just irritated me.  Again, his situation (and his family's) gripped me, but the character himself just wasn't fun to read about.  This made the final journey to the Wounded Woods boring to me, making that sequence drag as well.<br /><br />That's not to say the book was bad, though.  I don't think Bujold is capable of writing a \\"bad\\" book, and The Hallowed Hunt certainly isn't one.  Most of the time, the characterization is wonderful, and even Ingrey and Ijada come into their own.  Oswin is hilarious.  His wife, the sorceress Hallana, is even more so, and adds a light comic touch to her scenes with Ingrey and Ijada, yet she's also fairly deep for a minor character.  Even the complaints above (save Wencel) are mainly about the characters at certain times.  Overall, they were quite nice.  Bujold's prose is as gorgeous as ever, with only a few internal monologues feeling a bit clunky.  She does manage to mix a little bit of tragedy with some comedy relief without making it jarring.<br /><br />The Hallowed Hunt is well worth the read.  Just because it doesn't quite measure up to her previous Chalion outings does not change that.  Bujold has written another page-turner that I'm really glad to have read.<br /><br />David Royd Ijada come into their own.  Oswin is hilarious.

(Dortmunder Novels)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Even thieves can be good guys...kinda	Watch Your Back is the first John Dortmunder book I've ever read.  If this is any indication of Donald Westlake's ability, then I will be reading some more soon.  He has shown that he is one of the masters of the \\"caper\\" novel.  I have no idea how Watch Your Back compares to Westlake's other books, but I found it greatly enjoyable, if a bit uneven at times.  There's no mystery involved, but there's a lot of fun, along with the coincidences that make novels like this enjoyable.<br /><br />The back room of the O.J. Bar & Grill is the usual meeting place for John Dortmunder and his gang of thieves make their plans.  When their usual fence, Arnie Albright, comes back from Club Med with information about an apartment loaded with riches but empty of anybody else, they try and get together there to finalize everything.  Unfortunately, it looks like the Mob is moving in on the bar, and Dortmunder can't have that.  Preston Fareweather is a filthy rich man on the run from a pack of ex-wives, staying down at Club Med and cruelly toying with women and everybody else who comes near him.  His apartment lies empty most of the time, and makes a perfect target.  But Dortmunder can't get his mind off of the O.J, and works to rid it of the Mob as they get the heist ready too.  Everything comes together as both the Mob and Fareweather learn that you don't mess with John Dortmunder.<br /><br />This book would probably be shelved in the mystery section of the book store, but it certainly isn't that.  This is a classic caper novel, and Westlake does it with style.  Dortmunder is a fun character, though he isn't exactly the main character.  Watch Your Back (and, perhaps, Westlake's other novels?) is more of an ensemble piece, with Dortmunder just being the lead guy.  He is the one who insists that something needs to be done with the O.J, but otherwise Westlake treats him as just one of the many colourful characters in this novel.  And there are quite a few of them.<br /><br />Probably the funniest for me was Tiny, the big man who orders a limo when he needs to go places because taxis are too small for him.  He can be rough when he needs to be or when he's irritated (which is why the others don't want him to find out about the bar until he is safely away from there). He's also quite matter of fact with a hint of menace behind his tone.  When he speaks calmly, that's when you'd better watch out.  He has a cute relationship with Judson, the new kid on the block.  He sort of takes Judson under his wing with some advice, especially about not volunteering too often.  He was probably my favourite character in the book.<br /><br />That's not to say he was the only good one, though.  The rest of the gang definitely have their moments too.  They all speak in a distinctive way which makes them identifiable and they reek of New York City (which is a good thing, since the series is set there).  Westlake manages to catch all of their voices perfectly.  Especially fun is when they're talking on cell phones and have to talk around what they mean because they don't want anything incriminating going out on a wireless.<br /><br />Where the book falls down slightly is in the bad guy department.  The situation with Preston down at Club Med is amusing for a while, but I found the book dragging a little bit when he was around, which is hard to do with chapters this short.  The character was supposed to be annoying, but Westlake didn't quite walk that fine line between annoying and fun to read about and just annoying.  The whole Florida sequence with Preston just sat there on the page.  On the other hand, there are the Mob characters, who aren't really shown much.  Unfortunately, when they are around, they are bad Sopranos imitations.  Granted, the comparison is slightly intentional (the back cover blurb actually says that the main Mob character is a \\"would-be Tony Soprano\\"), but Westlake takes the parody a bit too far.  There is not a lot of bad language in the book, but whenever the Mob characters are on the page, the f-word is featured almost twice a sentence.  I found that the parody fell flat.<br /><br />Other than the Mob, Westlake's prose fits the genre perfectly.  It serves its purpose, moves the story along, and occasionally comes out with a zinger (the old woman minding her own business in the airplane is a perfect example that I won't spoil, but look for it if you read the book).  The story is told in a breezy way that moves quickly.  You won't be spending a lot of time on this book.  However, I think that's the point.  The chapters are short, the type is big, and the book is only 320 pages.  Light and breezy can be fun too, and Watch Your Back is definitely that.<br /><br />The only other minor problem could just be a symptom of the genre itself, and thus won't bother fans.  The storylines tie together with a massive series of coincidences that, while fun, strain the disbelief a little bit.  I laughed when they happened, but in hindsight, the ending suffered from too much happenstance.  Check your brain at the door when you get to the ending, and you will enjoy it too.  It would have meant more and been even funnier if we had gotten to know the Mob guys a bit better (and if they hadn't been bad parodies instead of real characters).<br /><br />All in all, Watch Your Back is a really good book.  Enjoyable in all the right places and with a few not very annoying faults, you'll have an entertaining time reading this book.<br /><br />David Royook, but whenever the Mob characters are on the page, the f-word is featured almost twice a sentence.

Bick, is another in the series of Lost Era Star Trek novels taking place in between the original series and Star Trek: The Next Generation.  These adventures show us a bit of the history that has only been mentioned in the television series.  Well of Souls tells a story about Captain Rachel Garrett and her crew on the Enterprise C, which met an unfortunate end a few years later (as shown in the TNG episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\").  Unfortunately, while Bick gives us an interesting book, it didn't grab me nearly as much as other Trek books have.<br /><br />An archaeological find on a distant planet may have an impact on Cardassian history, but also some ramifications in the here and now.  Do the ruins contain a portal that will allow teleportation around the galaxy?  Some criminal elements have taken an interest in this find, one of which has brought the ex-husband of Captain Rachel Garrett, commanding officer of the Enterprise C.  Garrett's having enough problems of her own, however, as her new first officer (Halak) has just returned from his leave unconscious in a battered shuttle, his fellow crewman and lover's dead body beside him.  Starfleet Intelligence seems very interested in him, and she's not sure how much she can trust him.  Will the power beneath the ruins on this desolate planet reach out and affect everybody's lives?<br /><br />This book, much like The Sundered, doesn't relate a specific incident mentioned in the series, but instead just gives us an adventure of a ship and crew.  Perhaps that is the problem, as I had the same reaction to the previous book as I had to this one.  As with The Sundered, there are some wonderful things about Well of Souls and some things that really bothered me, making for an overall average book.  I really enjoyed Bick's writing style, and she tells an interesting story.  The prose is quite different from most Trek novels, but that is a good thing in this case.  It makes the typical Trek reader sit up and take notice.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the characterization for the most part.  Garrett is hard-nosed when necessary (her dressing down of Counselor Tyvan when he's late for the hearing is wonderful), but she's also capable of being soft.  One of her first scenes is when she's communicating with her ex and her son, and the remorse that she feels at having missed her son's birthday is palpable.  She's capable of quick thinking and making the hard decisions, but we see how those decisions can affect her (especially poignant in the climax of the book).  Bick has done a great job with the very slight characterization of Garrett that we got in \\"Yesterday's Enterprise,\\" extrapolating wonderfully.  The only thing I could have done without is the angst that she carries around with her about her former first officer.  It seemed a bit overdone, and I think her hostility toward her new first officer could have come from a better place.<br /><br />Most of the other characters are well done too, with the exception of Garrett's husband, son, and the rest of the crew on the planet searching for the portal.  I found all of them to be extremely boring and I didn't care about any of them.  Chen-Mai is a stereotypical villain and the others are pretty bland as well.  This robbed many of the scenes of any interest as I kept waiting for Bick to get back to either the Enterprise or Halak.  It's a shame, as the situation on the planet could have been nail-biting as well.  Instead, these scenes just drag, and they also harm the climax a little bit too.<br /><br />One other small problem I had with the book is the tone.  It is very dark, which isn't always bad, but not what I usually look for in a Trek novel.  I don't mind my Trek to be a little bleak, but usually there's a little bit of levity involved too, coming from the characters.  Since there are no characters that we really know in Well of Souls (the few we even know a little about aren't given a lot of depth in \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\"), Bick is given free reign to build her own characters.  The closest to lightness we have is Dr. Stern, who is marvelous as a sounding board for Garrett and can always be depended on for an acerbic comment or two when the chips are down.  She's good friends with Dr. McCoy, so he gets a cameo, and their banter is quite good, but otherwise the book is very gloomy.  All the crewmembers who we get to know have some hidden secret within them that they eventually have to unload on whoever is affected by it.  Halak's story begins on a brutal world being controlled by two separate crime families, so those sequences are quite intense (though well-done, I must admit).  The lies start compounding themselves until they all have to be sorted out at the end.<br /><br />I found the first half of the book really hard to get into, as the story begins building slowly.  There are a lot of flashbacks as a few characters reveal their inner secrets, making the story bounce back and forth a little bit.  I loved the character of Bat-Levi and her problems really affected me, but the flashback to what caused everything just dragged the book to a screeching halt.  Half-way through, however, the book really picks up steam and I raced through it.  It grabs your attention and won't let it go.  Even the scenes on the planet improve a little bit.<br /><br />Finally, I have to give Bick credit for giving a lot of scientific information (I have no idea how much of it was technobabble and how much was based on real science, but it all sounded plausible to me) without dragging the book down even further.  She goes into the maneuvering of the various ships involved in the final confrontation with great detail, but it was always understandable, as was the sequence inside the Draavids.  The ship performs a daring rescue and almost gets sucked into a black hole, and Bick makes it all exciting.<br /><br />When I started this review, I was going to give the book three stars.  However, I think there are enough positives in the book to put it over the hump to four.  It would rank third in the four books of The Lost Era that I've read so far, but it is well worth a read.  Just be ready for a little depression afterward.<br /><br />David Roy\\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\"), Bick is given free reign to build her own characters.

DeCandido is one of the masters of Star Trek books.  Whenever I see one written by him, I know it's going to be at least entertaining, even if there may be too many Trek continuity references for my taste.  The Art of the Impossible, the third in the \\"Lost Era\\" series of Trek books, by definition uses a lot of these references, but here it can mostly be excused, as that's the whole point of the series.  DeCandido tries to explain many of the minor references to past events that were made in the television series, making the Trek universe into a more cohesive whole.  At times seeming like a mish-mash of Trek continuity, overall DeCandido succeeds in writing a great book.<br /><br />It's about 35 years before the time of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the Cardassian Empire is in the process of expanding its borders.  This has both the Federation and the Klingon Empire a little concerned, the Klingons even more so when the Cardassians stumble upon a planet with an ancient Klingon wreck on it.  The Klingons think this is an ancient relic of their first spaceflight, and demand that the planet be given to them.  The Cardassians dispute this, and Federation diplomat Curzon Dax hatches a plan that would allow both empires to peacefully compete for ownership of the planet.  Over the next 18 years, galactic politics cause tension among all the empires, with this planet always remaining in the background.  The Romulans, hiding behind their borders after the Tomed Incident (see Serpents Among the Ruins), are still hatching plots and getting involved in a clandestine manner.  The results of all this will cause huge changes in the Klingon Empire, as well as for the Federation-Klingon alliance.<br /><br />This is one Star Trek that I cannot really recommend for anybody other than a Trek fan.  While it would be mostly understandable to the Trek neophyte, I can't see that it would be that interesting.  The Art of the Impossible covers the eighteen-year tensions between the Klingons and Cardassians that was referred to by Garak in a Deep Space Nine episode.  As a fan of Klingons, it was enjoyable seeing the inner workings of the Empire at a time before The Next Generation.  Many councilors are questioning the alliance between the Klingons and the Federation, feeling that it is making the Empire weak.  We see the inner workings of the Cardassian Empire as well, seeing for the first time (at least chronologically) how the military, government, and Obsidian Order (the Cardassian secret intelligence) work together, or sometimes not together.  All of this is probably fascinating for the Trek fan, but probably not that much to an outsider.<br /><br />That isn't to say that DeCandido doesn't try.  It is an extremely well-written book.  The various characterizations, both of people we have seen (like Colonel Worf, from Star Trek VI) and original characters.  Elias Vaughn, of Starfleet Intelligence, gets revealed even more, and is probably the best character in the book.  I also loved the tension between the diplomat Dax and the Intelligence agent Vaughn.  They really do despise each other and what they stand for, but are able to work together when they must to further the goals of the Federation.  Dax is even able to admit making a mistake, which is nice to see.  DeCandido even gives us interesting people who we know won't live for very long, such as Mogh and his wife (these are the parents of Worf, from the television series, which revealed that they died in a Romulan attack). I can't think of any character in The Art of the Impossible who seemed like a waste of space or time.  Characterization is one of DeCandido's strong points, and again it shines through.<br /><br />However, my head hurt bouncing from all the different situations, most of which were referred to in the television series in at least some fashion.  We see the Khitomer attack.  We get to meet Deanna Troi's father and hear more detail on how her mother did everything she could to erase the existence of her sister who died when Deanna was very little.  We see Rachel Garrett, captain of the Enterprise C in the episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise,\\" before she became captain.  We see the formation of the Klingon High Council that ultimately we become familiar with in various other Next Generation episodes.  It just became a little too much, and with all of this other continuity, I found the inclusion of Colonel Worf to be pointless.<br /><br />Given what he had to work with, DeCandido did a wonderful job with it.  It's a testament to his writing that I found the book enjoyable despite the \\"kitchen sink\\" feel to the book.  With Trek's already established history, DeCandido had a lot of ground to cover, and he does it really well. He succeeds in giving us characters that we like to read about, with events that go by quickly.  The book is very readable and will keep you hooked.  I finished it very quickly.<br /><br />Just to let you know, while there is some action in the book, the drama comes mostly from the politics involved and how these politics interact with the characters.  This is a thinking-man's Trek book, and if you find the give-and-take of the diplomatic realm boring, then you also may not like this book.  Written properly, as DeCandido has done, the cut and thrust of diplomacy can be as interesting as any gunfight.  Decandido has truly performed \\"the art of the impossible\\" with this book, tying together all of the disparate elements of Trek history into a wonderful tapestry.

US	50332419	R3BOIIPMPFJLMP	0743491793	506097072	Star Trek: A Time for War, A Time for Peace (Star Trek)(Star Trek The Next Generation)(Star Trek Deep Space Nine)(Star Trek Voyager)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Setting things up for the movie...	After nine books, it finally comes to an end.  Keith DeCandido's A Time for War, A Time for Peace finishes off this long series that leads up to the movie Star Trek: Nemesis.  In fact, the book even has an epilogue that takes place after the movie, leading into the new Riker book series, where he's captain of the U.S.S. Titan (as mentioned in the movie).  The series has shown the Enterprise going through trials and tribulations that would break a softer crew.  Old friends are moving on and nothing will be the same again.  Thus, the book has a lot on its plate.  It's amazing how little action there is in the book, considering everything that happens.  In fact, this cluttered feeling is one of its problems.<br /><br />This is almost a hodgepodge of a novel, with some politics thrown in, some grudges, backstabbing, hard memories and a little bit of intrigue.  The characterizations, as in most DeCandido Trek novels, is flawless.  Everybody from Picard to Chancellor Martok to Scotty is perfectly in character and interesting to read about.  The plotting is also quite intricate, with multiple storylines coexisting almost flawlessly.  DeCandido bounces from one to the other with great skill, bringing them together when the need arises.  It was a hard book to put down (in fact, I didn't, really, finishing it in one night).  He also resolves all the dangling storylines, such as Picard being in Starfleet's doghouse for the events at the beginning of the series, or Crusher's final decision on whether or not to take the job as head of Starfleet Medical.  Riker and Troi are planning their wedding, with much interference from Troi's mother.  Worf has to return to the fold somehow, since he's now an ambassador and he clearly wasn't in the movie.  He even includes a reason why Wesley Crusher was in a Starfleet uniform at the Riker/Troi wedding reception in the movie.  Finally, DeCandido has to ship off a few of the characters who don't show up in Nemesis, such as the wonderful security chief, Christine Vale.  Thankfully, it appears that she will be back, either in the Titan series with Riker, or in the continuation of The Next Generation.<br /><br />That's a lot of balls to juggle, along with the election, Klingon intrigue and the inspection.  So it's not surprising that occasionally the balls get dropped.  The book was captivating while I read it, but my neck also hurt because of the bouncing of my head from story to story.  The book feels very packed and some of the stories feel tacked on.  The Kahless story, while influencing the Worf storyline, is brought up and solved in a perfunctory fashion that didn't quite fit in with the rest of the book.  The inspectors created a lot of anxiety for the crew, especially given their background and their past dealings with the crew of the Enterprise.  However, we don't see a lot of them.  There's a classic scene between Crusher and her inspector, who she has harshly criticized for years after what happened in the television episode \\"Ethics.\\"  However, other than that scene, we never see her until the end where we get the results of the inspection. The commander of the inspection, Captain Go, is fleshed out a little more, but not by much.  The only inspector we see a lot of is Scotty, but that's for obvious reasons, not to mention because he is a sounding board for Geordi.<br /><br />Given those weaknesses, though, the book is still a great read.  One criticism of DeCandido I've had in the past is the tendency to include a lot of continuity references and then taking paragraphs to explain them.  He really lessens that tendency in A Time for War, a Time for Peace.  There are plenty of references, but the explanations are fluid and generally don't detract from the story.  The epilogue, with Vale and Riker talking about the Titan, was very moving and showcased Vale's character wonderfully.  In fact, Vale's part of the book is probably my favourite, from her joining the poker game with \\"The D Guys,\\" (thosecrewmembers who served on the Enterprise D before it was destroyed) to her sorrow at what happened to Data in Nemesis, she is perfectly done, and I'm glad we're going to be seeing her again.<br /><br />A Time for War, a Time for Peace is a fitting conclusion to the whole A Time to... series.  It wraps up everything, leaving things perfectly placed for the movie, but it also tells an interesting tale.  Even though you may recognize faults in the book, you will probably have a hard time putting it down if you're any sort of Trek fiction fan.  It wraps you up in a lot of familiar characters, both from the television show as well as those introduced for the novels, and gives you a warm feeling inside.  It also leaves things nicely laced for post-Nemesis books, making the wait very hard for the next book to come out.  That's the mark of a standout book.<br /><br />David Roythose crewmembers who served on the Enterprise D before it was destroyed) to her sorrow at what happened to Data in Nemesis, she is perfectly done, and I'm glad we're going to be seeing her again. <br /> <br />A Time for War, a Time for Peace is a fitting conclusion to the whole A Time to... series.

A Calculus of Angels, the second book in the Age of Unreason series by J. Gregory Keyes, does exactly what a second book is supposed to do.  It builds on the first book, giving us more insight into the greater problem that the series addresses, as well as moving all the characters forward.  The alternate history that Keyes has built is fascinating stuff, much richer than the \\"what if World War II turned out differently\\" that many authors use.  A Calculus of Angels is a wonderful mixture of sorcery, alchemy, and science.  Keyes also adds a few more characters to the mix, making for a much deeper story.<br /><br />We are a few years removed from when the great comet hit London and wiped out much of western Europe.  Those in the Americas, not having heard anything from Europe in quite a while, are ready to join forces (French, English, and Native) to send an expedition to find out what is happening.  Meanwhile, Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia, is on the march to conquer what is left of Europe.  Sir Isaac Newton and his young apprentice, Ben Franklin, are in Prague, attempting to figure out what is really going on.  Adrienne, former lover of King Louis of France, is on the run from the remnants of the French nobility, all vying for what's left of the French throne.  What spirits are using the world to fight their own war against humanity?  Are these spirits religious in nature, servants of God?  Or are they trying to fight everything that humanity holds dear?  Who controls who?  And will Peter be able to conquer everything in his path with the mysterious flying ships that he wields?  All will come together in one city, one fatal encounter that could decide everything.  And what does Adrienne's child have to do with all of this?<br /><br />A Calculus of Angels is a much better book than Newton's Cannon, mainly for its broader scope.  The first book was pretty narrow, concentrating mainly on Adrienne and Ben Franklin.  This one covers a lot more ground.  Ben and Adrienne are still prominent, and they get a lot of development, as Ben chafes under Newton's refusal to tell him what Newton is researching and Adrienne learns her place in this spiritual war that is going on.  But Keyes gives us more storylines to follow as well.  There is the expedition from the Americas to discover what is going on.  This party gives us a wonderful character in the Choctaw shaman, Red Shoes.  It also gives us Cotton Mather, Blackbeard (former pirate and now governor of a small colony) and the French governor of Louisiana, Bienville.  It is through them that we see most of the devastation that covers Europe, especially Great Britain.<br /><br />While Mather is a bit of a stereotypical religious figure, he does have his moments where he is surprising.  The others aren't quite as well-drawn, though they serve their purposes well in supporting Red Shoes and getting him where he needs to be.  Especially good is the scene where some of the ship's crew take Red Shoes for a night on the town, and he sees the deadness in the girl that is given to him, even as the others finish their night of debauchery.  This highlights the other world that only he can see, and gives us a great bit of his character.<br /><br />Probably the best scenes in the book, however, involve young Ben as he tries to make his way in Prague.  Newton is being very uncooperative and Ben is trying to do his best to fit in.  He is an intelligent young man himself, and he's invented many toys for the King to play with, but he knows that Newton's holding something back.  The interplay between the two is wonderful, especially in their final scene together as Newton realizes just how much he's hurt Ben.  Once Ben and the others leave Prague, it's not quite as interesting, and the scenes in Venice drag a little bit.  Still, he's the most important character in the book, and he carries it well.<br /><br />The only thing that really mars the book, and it's a small thing, is how everybody ends up in thesame place at the same time.  Considering the number of storylines that are going on, this stretches the coincidence just a little too much.  Once they are all there, it makes for a riveting conclusion as Ben tries his best to outwit his opponents and survive himself.  The ending is a bit predictable, but it leads into an epilogue that really makes you want to read the next book to see where the story goes from here.<br /><br />One aspect of Newton's Cannon that I hated was the way Keyes began chapters in the middle of action and had the characters reflect back on what happened to catch the reader up.  Keyes still does this occasionally, but it's not quite as noticeable this time.  This really adds to the strength of the book, as the prose flows a lot better.  The prose is rougher than it is in Keyes' Kingdoms of Thorn & Bone series, but it's earlier in his career, so a bit more acceptable.  Keyes has taken an interesting premise and spun half of a very interesting tale. I'm looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />David Roynds up in the same place at the same time.

US	50332419	R31E6MMZCD27NF	0380977109	267891813	Exile's Return (Conclave of Shadows, Book 3)	Books	4	6	11	N	N	Hack & slash, with a thought or two	Raymond E. Feist confuses me, especially with his latest book, Exile's Return, part 3 of the Conclave of Shadows. I said in my review of King of Foxes that the story of Talon of the Silver Hawk is over and that anything afterward would be extra. Here is that extra. However, it leaves off on a pretty massive \\"to be continued,\\" yet I have heard that the next book is the start of *another* series, beginning right after Exile's Return ends. What's the point? Why not have a book 4? It can't be marketing, as there are many series that go far past book 4 and are successful. I could even see Exile's Return being the beginning of a new series, as it involves a new character and Talon is only peripheral. However, the book is what it is, and it is a very good book. It's interesting, has a good main character who redeems himself in many ways, and introduces an otherworldly threat that will be very hard to defeat.<br /><br />Kaspar, the former Duke of Olasko before being deposed by Talon, has been exiled to a strange continent on the other side of the world for his crimes. He is left penniless, almost naked, and he is quickly set upon by bandits when he appears there by dimensional shift. Kaspar uses his wits, however, and quickly turns the tide on his captors, escaping into the wild. As he makes his way across the continent, he thinks about his predicament and what led to his downfall, including the lies and sorcery committed by the man who he deemed advisor, Leso Varen. He is determined to return to Olasko and avenge himself on Talon. However, circumstances get him involved in an artifact from another world, leading him to enlist Talon's help in contacting the Conclave of Shadows for assistance. In the process, Kaspar learns that there is more to life than power, and that he hasn't necessarily led a good one. Too bad that the process of learning that could kill him, and the rest of Midkemia.<br /><br />My review of King of Foxes criticized Feist heavily for the way the story portrayed women; basically, they were nothing but sexual objects throughout the story. Feist avoids that pitfall this time, mostly by not having any female characters in the book. The two who are in it, however, are much stronger (though very minor). Johanna is a woman whose husband has disappeared after going to the nearest town for market. While she doesn't do a whole lot in the book, we can see that she is quite determined to keep the farm that she and her son occupy successful, despite the fact that there are only the two of them. Kaspar admires her greatly, thinking back to the way he used to treat peasants in Olasko (when he could be deigned to notice them at all). There is nothing romantic about their relationship at all, and he leaves her farm a better man for it. I really liked her and what Feist did with her. The other female character is the wife of the head wizard in the Conclave, and she doesn't do a lot, but at least she acts like a normal woman.<br /><br />Most of the characters in Exile's Return are fairly thin, but they serve their purpose well in the story. Kaspar is the protagonist, and this is his story of redemption. He realizes that he was deceived a great deal by Varen, and that Varen is still a big danger to the world. He begins doing the right thing when he is compelled to by the magic around the artifact being carried by the group of men he falls in with, however, that magic eventually disappears and he still finds himself doing the right thing. A great deal of the first part of the book, especially when he's dying of thirst, is taken up with his thoughts on what happened, his determination to kill Talon, and the realization of what he had done. Thankfully, Feist avoids having him come to all the right conclusions immediately, as his determination for vengeance still rings brightly for quite a while. Kaspar is even more interesting than Talon was in the first two books, which is saying something.<br /><br />The plot isn't the most unique outthere, but it serves its purpose as sword and sorcery. The conclave is a bit clich&eacute;d, very reminiscent of the wizard councils in various Dungeons & Dragons books, traveling hither and yon through teleportation. The artifact that they have in their possession is kind of interesting, an unstoppable force that shows our heroes how tough it will be if more of those artifacts come into this world. I haven't read the Riftwar saga, so I hope that Feist isn't repeating himself with the rifts opening up keyed to the artifact they have. There's certainly a lot of action, or at least talking about action, throughout the book, so it isn't very deep. Once Kaspar's internal struggles with his philosophy are through, the book pretty much just plows through the plot without a lot of characterization. That does make it a fun read, however, just not very thought-provoking.<br /><br />This is my first Feist series, and I'm very happy to say that, despite the numerous references to past books, you don't have to read any of them first. Feist does a very good job of filling the reader in along the way, giving just enough information to tell us what happened without dwelling on it too much. Only somebody who has read them can say whether they are too detailed or not, but I valued it.<br /><br />Fans of Feist will probably love this book, and I definitely think it's better than King of Foxes. If you like some straightforward adventure, then this will appeal to you too. Just don't expect to think a lot.<br /><br />David Royique out there, but it serves its purpose as sword and sorcery.

US	50332419	R1H5O8XALXT8DF	0743491785	859293155	A Star Trek: The Next Generation: Time #8: A Time to Heal	Books	5	4	6	N	N	One of the most violent books is Trek history	One of the common things about the books in Star Trek's A Time to... series is that the two books by the same author are just one continuing story.  There's a cliffhanger at the end of the first book and then the second one goes on from there.  While David Mack's A Time to Heal is the same in this respect, it is much different in tone and substance from it's predecessor, A Time to Kill.  The first book had very short chapters and moved at a frenetic pace.  The political intrigue was there, but it was mixed in with six separate special operations missions that filled the book with the tension of one thing going wrong making the whole thing fall to pieces.  A Time to Heal, instead, is much more introspective.  There is still a lot of violence (and the infamous David Mack body count), but the passages are much longer, the violence much more personal, and the deaths a lot more meaningful.  This is another outstanding book.<br /><br />The planet Tezwa is under Federation occupation, as it was the only way to keep the secret that the Federation government had given advanced weapons to its despotic leader, Kinchawn, hidden.  Kinchawn and his government escaped, however, and captured Commander Riker in the process.  They head an insurgency of terror that kills many Starfleet officers as well as natives of the planet in bombings and other terror attacks.  Captain Picard and the Enterprise head a fleet of Starfleet vessels to help the new Tezwan government maintain control, as well as to hunt Kinchawn down.  Unbeknownst to them, many of their clean-up orders are designed to remove all evidence of the government's secrets.  As things begin to spiral out of control on Tezwa, more and more Starfleet officers are killed, but Picard's crew also begin uncovering what really happened.  If they are allowed to continue, a government could fall.  Or is that exactly what Section 31, the infamous secret intelligence organization, wants?<br /><br />I'll get the obvious out of the way first.  Yes, this book reads like a novel about the war in Iraq, and if you want to see it as a political novel, you're more than welcome to.  Personally, I think there's enough ambiguity in the book that it's not clear that Mack is using it to make a political statement.  Personally, I choose to read it as a novel set in a situation similar, but not exactly the same.  Mack has obviously used current events as a springboard to an interesting story, and that's all I'm interested in.<br /><br />And the story *is* interesting.  In many of my reviews of this series, I have stated how wonderful it is that we are getting to know various other crewmembers of the Enterprise in some detail.  This comes to a head in A Time to Heal, as many of these people we have come to know die pretty tragically in this book.  Some do survive, so you are still able to be surprised when a death finally happens.  Mack's ability to make each death felt by the reader is unmatched.  These are not just faceless characters, given a character trait or two for identification, ready to be bumped off at a moment's notice.  The carnage really does begin to affect you.  While the book is extremely interesting, this causes it to be a little depressing and hard to get through as well.<br /><br />In fact, that's probably the major strike against the book.  It gets very oppressive very quickly and then stays that way for long passages.  The death and destruction is vividly told, but it's also constant.  Thus, it may not fit what you expect a Star Trek novel to be and you may not enjoy it.  If you skip it, however, you will be missing one of the pivotal books in the whole Star Trek series, as events in this novel lead into both the next book (A Time for War, A Time for Peace) and the continuation of both Riker's story as captain of the Titan (Taking Wing) and the Enterprise's story (A Death in Winter).  Just be ready for a little grimness before all of this.<br /><br />The characterization in A Time to Heal is much the same as in the previous book.  Beverly Crusher gets a lot more characterization as she not only starts leaning toward accepting the position at Starfleet Medical, but finds a love interest that may spur Picard into finally making a move on her after all these years of guilt-ridden friendship.  The scene where Picard comes to her quarters for breakfast and discovers crumpled sheets is wonderful.  Riker gets to act all stoic as he's held prisoner for most of the book, and Troi gets some counseling of her own, which isn't quite as interesting.  LaForge and Data are mostly characterized through their attempts to track down what's really happening, though Data gets a lot of development as the acting first officer in Riker's absence.  In fact, that may be the best part of the book, as we get to see him in action, running constant battle drills because of the situation that they're in.  It's a vivid contrast to Riker's command style, and it's a major impetus for Riker when he finally returns.<br /><br />The only character who suffered much was actually Picard, as he's not really prominent in the book.  He seems to be very \\"hands-off\\" during the occupation and he doesn't seem very effective.  Most of the concentration in the book is on everybody else, so that's not necessarily a bad thing.  He just doesn't seem to be as \\"in charge\\" as he usually does, which doesn't seem like him.  He really comes into his own during the conversation with the admirals, near the end of the book.  He steers them around to his way of thinking very nicely.<br /><br />All in all, A Time to Heal is a wonderful book that's just hard to get through at times.  The continuing violence gets a bit monotonous after a while, but the attempts by the government to cover up what's really going on do help to break that up a little.  What we're left with is a great book that leads into the final book in the series.  If you're thinking of continuing the Next Generation saga, then this book is definitely important.  Feel free to read whatever politics you want into it as well.<br /><br />David RoyHeal is much the same as in the previous book.

David Mack's entry into the A Time to... series of books opens up a lot of political intrigue that could shake the Federation to its core.  A Time to Kill is another outstanding entry into this series.  Marred only by a mildly \\"everything works out for the best\\" atmosphere that doesn't quite fit the difficulty of the Enterprise's mission, Mack still gives us a stellar book.  The style fits the situation perfectly, making the reader read \\"just one more chapter\\" until the end of the book is reached.<br /><br />Federation president Min Zife has a problem.  During the Dominion War, the Federation sold advanced weaponry to the ruler of Tezwa to establish a fallback option in case the war went badly.  Unfortunately, the ruler of Tezwa, Kinchawn, is a power-mad zealot who is willing to go to war with the Klingons to satisfy his own material needs.  This would be very bad for Zife, as any war between the Klingons and Tezwa would reveal the weapons on the Klingon doorstep, sparking a war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.  Unfortunately, Kinchawn uses the weapons to wipe out a fleet of Klingon ships and almost takes out the Enterprise as well during a diplomatic mission to calm hostilities.  The Klingons want blood, and the Enterprise is sent to try and resolve the crisis before the Klingons can discover what's there.  Captain Picard must find a way to neutralize the weapons as well as neutralizing the Klingon fleet that's been sent to conquer Tezwa, all at the same time.  How will he do this?  It will take coordinated attacks to prevent the guns from firing on Tezwa, as well as a little help from Ambassador Worf on the Klingon homeworld to stop the Klingons.  If one thing goes wrong, the Federation will be plunged into a war that will weaken both parties, leaving everything open for the Romulans.<br /><br />A Time to Kill is quite intricate, almost too much so.  Enterprise personnel must disable all six guns at the same moment, and Worf must come through at the same time.  If even one thing goes wrong, everything goes wrong.  Yes, the assault teams have their problems and setbacks, causing what tension there is in the novel, but everything ends up being a little too convenient.  One thing that doesn't quite work out leaves a plot point for the next novel, but otherwise it feels a little unrealistic. I felt this would be the case when the situation was set up, so by the time it actually happened, I had grown used to it and went along for the ride.  Thus, it's not a major problem.  It's just something that's mildly annoying at the time.<br /><br />Otherwise, A Time to Kill is a non-stop thrill ride, full of tension.  The book has very short chapters, adding to the intense feeling.  The chapters jump from one assault team to another, back to the Enterprise, to the President's office, as well as to another secret organization that's watching all this from elsewhere.  There is a lot at stake, which just adds to the tension.  It's almost like a music video, never giving the reader time to relax.  The only parts that seem to drag a bit are the ones on Qo'nos, but that's only in relation to the rest of the book.  I found Worf's attempts to do what Picard needs him to do to be duller than the events on Tezwa.<br /><br />The book is very plot-driven, but Mack does do a good job with the characters as well.  Dr. Crusher is still considering the offer to assume the position of Head of Starfleet Medical, and she's hurt that Picard hasn't come to her about it.  Picard, meanwhile, is hurt that Crusher hasn't come to him to talk to him about it.  This does seem a little bit \\"high school,\\" but it doesn't come out that way in the book (well, not very much).  Instead, the book examines their relationship as it has gone throughout the years of the television series and the movies.  It's actually quite effective.<br /><br />Even better is the characterization of the assault teams.  We get to see a lot of new characters in action, and we're given some meaty looks at them.  Most impressive (though a bit clich&eacute;d), is Razka, a reptilian non-commissioned security guard who acts like most sergeants do in war films.  He's experienced, he's gruff, and he gets the job done.  He is stereotypical, but I still found myself drawn to him.  Maybe it was the scales.  The other security officers are also given a lot to do.  One thing this series has been wonderful with has been the security officers.  They are not just nameless redshirts, and they aren't treated that way, either.  We are starting to really get to know some of them, and while some of them die, some of them don't.  Since the characterization of them is so good, it actually hurts when one of them does die.<br /><br />One annoying aspect of characterization, however, was Zeitsev, one member of the mysterious organization that is following all of these events.  His superior officer, a Vulcan, is evidently very attractive and he has a crush on her, despite her being a lot older than he is.  This crush does nothing in this book except detract from the character.  I hope it becomes a plot point somewhere in the next two books, as otherwise it just stands out as a grating character trait with no purpose.<br /><br />This entire series has been a slow starter, but the last three books have been wonderful.  They keep the reader coming back for more, wondering what's going to happen next.  The end of A Time to Kill leaves a nice cliffhanger as well as a possible opportunity to comment on current events.  We'll see what A Time to Heal gives us.  I know I'm reading them as fast as I can.<br /><br />David Roywe're given some meaty looks at them.

US	50332419	R92E7MZGAPWIQ	0743467701	868844778	Dragon Precinct	Books	4	8	9	N	N	A day in the life of the Dragon precinct house?	Keith R.A. DeCandido is best known for his Star Trek books, of which there are many.  Now, however, he's decided to branch out into his own world, at least for a little while.  Dragon Precinct is his first original novel, and here's hoping there are some more.  Should he write more in this particular series?  I'm not sure how many it can sustain, but I wouldn't mind seeing some of these characters again.  Dragon Precinct takes a lot of fantasy conventions (elves, halflings, dwarves, and magic) and uses them for an interesting murder mystery.  The solution comes a little out of left field, but that doesn't hurt the book too badly.<br /><br />Gan Brightblade is one of the world's biggest heroes.  He and his friends have defeated many a monster and evil wizard, including the ultra-evil wizard Chalmraik.  They are in Cliff's End for an unknown reason, but Gan is destined to stay there:  dead.  Half-elven detective Danthres Tresyllione and her partner, Torin ban Wyvald, are tasked with finding out who murdered him and, more importantly, how.  No magic of any kind can be detected and he has no visible wounds.  Even worse, Gan was a friend of the Lord and Lady of Cliff's End, and they are putting great pressure on the detectives to solve the mystery quickly.  What do Gan's friends know about this, and will any of them survive to tell?  Is Chalmraik back from the dead?  And can they solve the murder before Danthres herself kills somebody?<br /><br />Dragon Precinct is a very quick read, but that's not a bad thing.  DeCandido gives us some interesting characterization that bends the molds of the typical fantasy characters.  Some of it is old-hat (both elves and humans hate half-elven offspring, elves are rather haughty people), but there are just enough differences that the book doesn't feel derivative.  Danthres has a chip on her shoulder that would seem impossible to carry around with her, but she's still fun to read about.  Her temper gets the best of her at times, even with her friends.  We learn early that she didn't have the best childhood, being one of those rare half-elves that survive past birth, and given the worst facial features of both races.  Unfortunately, we don't find out the reason why until the very end of the book, where she deigns to explain everything to her friends.  This felt a little awkward, though unloading herself does finally give her some of the freedom she needs to be a better person.<br /><br />Torin is also intriguing, with his ex-soldier background.  He once served with the current commander of the police force in the army and he carries some of that baggage around with him.  He has his own informants in various shady areas of town, is able to use some of his military skills in his job, and he makes a very good foil for Danthres.  He's also occasionally her lover, though that doesn't seem to have affected their working relationship.  It's a very casual relationship which jumps off the page.  He's the only one who can talk sense into Danthres when she's willing to lose her job rather than apologize to somebody.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are given interesting hooks and are fairly well-rounded, but the book isn't really about them.  There are two other sets of partners who figure prominently in the book, perhaps too prominently.  The inclusion of their cases gives the book almost a \\"day in the life\\" feel which doesn't really fit with the plot itself, almost as if there wasn't enough plot to fill even the 237 pages that there are in the book.  They're interesting characters, but they seem a bit out of place other than to flesh out the precinct.  Osric, the captain, plays the typical gruff captain's role, being there mainly to yell at his detectives or for them to report to.<br /><br />The other problem with the book is that the solution seems to come from nowhere.  A chance comment from the forensic wizard all of a sudden sparks a thought that ends up solving everything.  Even worse, it's a comment that the wizard, if he wasn't so arrogant, would probably have made earlier, though of course it may not have meant anything to the detectives earlier.  It's really the only fault of the mystery part of the story.  As for the other detectives' cases, they are solved rather perfunctorily as well.  Actually, even more so.  While Torin and Danthres' case takes center stage, the other cases are in the book just enough to detract from it, making the book seem a bit disjointed.<br /><br />Even with these problems, Dragon Precinct is an enjoyable read. DeCandido's prose is fairly solid and the dialogue is quite good as well.  He seems to let loose with the swear words a little bit, as if he's felt inhibited doing too many Star Trek books, so if swearing is a problem for you, stay away from it.  The good characters help save the fact that their cases are solved way too easily, making only the end of the book weaker than it really should be.  If a lot of Danthres' background that's revealed in the last few pages had been sprinkled throughout the rest of the book, I don't think any part of the book would have dragged.  If a police procedural in a magical fantasy world sounds like your cup of tea, you really can't go wrong with Dragon Precinct.<br /><br />David Royit's a comment that the wizard, if he wasn't so arrogant, would probably have made earlier, though of course it may not have meant anything to the detectives earlier.

Bring Own Ancient Artifact	It's been a while since I've read a straightforward fantasy comedy (as opposed to Terry Pratchett, whose books are comedic fantasy with a point), so maybe that's why I was definitely in the mood for John Moore's Heroics for Beginners.  This story is so light that it would blow away with a stiff wind.  Yet it's oddly enjoyable with a lot of silliness, poking fun at almost every fantasy convention that's out there.  Evil Overlord?  Check.  Dark castle with air vents for easy Heroic access?  Check.  The cover tells anybody who picks it up that \\"this will be a silly book.\\" I really liked it, though whether you will depends on how much silliness you can put up with.<br /><br />Prince Kevin Timberline, of Rassendas, is one of the four finalists to woo the \\"Ice Princess\\" of Deserae, not to mention her father and the other councilors who must agree to any wedding.  His main adversary is Prince Logan of Angostura, a military genius and veteran of many wars.  Then, the unthinkable happens, and word is received that Ancient Artifact Number 7 has been stolen by Lord Voltmeter (He Who Must Be Named) for whatever Diabolical Plan he has cooked up.  Whoever rescues the artifact will probably win the girl too, so Prince Kevin is determined to beat Logan to the punch, especially after reading Robert Taylor's Handbook of Practical Heroics.  Will Kevin be able to do it?  What is Lord Voltmeter's Diabolical Plan?  Is it different than any other Evil Overlord's Diabolical Plan?  And will it involve an Evil Overlord's Assistant for Kevin to seduce?  And just how will they get out of the Fortress of Doom's gift shop?<br /><br />Many things in Heroics for Beginners made me laugh out loud.  Some others made me groan the way a good pun makes you groan.  And then there are bits that made me groan in pain.  This book is very self-referential, using fantasy stereotypes as sources of comedy, as when Valerie, Voltmeter's assistant, is told to dress more like an Evil Overlord's Assistant, with her high leather boots and spiked heels.  Lord Voltmeter is all prepared to tell the captured Logan his plan, as all Evil Overlords do just before leaving the hero to die, but he doesn't feel that Kevin's worth it when he discovers that Kevin is not Logan.  A lot of these jokes work by catching you off guard, though they do grow tired after continual use (such as Valerie's clothes, said joke being used multiple times).  One that didn't grow tired, because Moore uses it in different ways each time, is the ventilation shaft joke.  It's introduced in the opening scene with Thunk the Barbarian, but is made even funnier as the Fortress guards try to convince Kevin to use it to get into the castle (a sign says \\"LOCKED OUT?  TRY OUR EXTENDED HOURS.  VENTILATION SHAFT OPEN UNTIL 10 P.M.).<br /><br />However, the original bits of comedy are often funnier as they hit the reader and then go on their way.  Some of these bits are short while others are long.  I found the safety posters in the torture chamber especially amusing.  A longer sequence in the middle of the book, detailing the rise of Lord Voltmeter, is even better.  He kills the current king of a fairytale kingdom, and then tries to figure out how to kill all of the heirs and thus assume absolute power, as the king had seven siblings, and each one of those siblings had many more children.  An edict to kill all children won't work as some are in their twenties.  Watching Voltmeter and his minions try and do the math was priceless.<br /><br />Of course, there are some faults with the book.  As stated before, some of the jokes are run into the ground a little bit.  Others fall flat right at the outset (unfortunately, one of those is a horrible pun at the beginning of the book, making me wonder about the book for a moment).  Like a Mel Brooks or a \\"Naked Gun\\" movie, the jokes come fast and furious, so even if one falls, another one will be right around the corner.  Oddly, the beginning is the slowest part, and it takes a fewpages for the book to become truly funny.  The ending, while somewhat predictable, doesn't turn out quite the way you would believe, which is another plus.<br /><br />Don't expect anything deep out of Heroics for Beginners, as you won't get it.  Moore obviously wrote this book to entertain, and he does his job.  There is no commentary on the fantasy tropes that Moore uses.  Instead, he just takes them and makes fun of them.  The characters in the book are either twists on these stereotypes, or people outside the stereotypes who are aware of them and trying to circumvent them.  Kevin is a good protagonist, as is Princess Rebecca, but neither one is given a lot of depth.  We get no real reason why Rebecca has the \\"Ice Princess\\" persona, but Kevin has a masterful scene that shows off his character and intelligence in the early part of the book.  He's the only one who gets even close to three-dimensional.  This weakens the story a little bit, but not enough to really detract from the reader's enjoyment.  The purpose is the jokes, right?<br /><br />Heroics for Beginners is the perfect light read for fantasy fans who are not only tired of the clich&eacute;s, but the brick-like books that contain those clich&eacute;s.  You'll even laugh some too, which can't be a bad thing.<br /><br />David Royes a few pages for the book to become truly funny.

US	50332419	REO5UE3Q18QCH	0553381946	181608296	Given Up for Dead: America's Heroic Stand at Wake Island	Books	5	22	22	N	N	One of the first tough fights for the American military in WWII	Everybody knows about Pearl Harbor, and the sneak attack by the Japanese that helped usher the Americans into World War II.  On the other hand, not that many people know about Wake island, the heroic stand of less than 1000 U.S. Marines and the civilian contractors who were there to help build it up, which began very shortly after Pearl Harbor and ended two days before Christmas.  With Given Up For Dead, Bill Sloan has done his part to rectify this lack of knowledge.  With powerful prose and words from the men who served there (and even a few from the invaders), Sloan tells us the story of these men and what they went through.  The book is riveting, relatively easy to read, and quite thorough.<br /><br />Wake island is a sleepy little atoll out in the middle of the Pacific, but it is strategically located.  It was originally supposed to be built up during the 1930s, but lack of funding hampered this, until the coming of Pan Am, who wished to use it as a base for transoceanic travel.  The island is mostly coral, scrub and trees, and is pretty desolate.  For these men, however, it would become a crucible, and it would also gain the American military its first victory over the Japanese, though it was short-lived.  The final defeat is shown to be completely unnecessary, as only a few miscues by the commanders (both on the island itself and back in Hawaii) result in the premature ending of a battle that was actually going fairly well for the Americans.<br /><br />Sloan has interviewed most of the survivors from this battle, and he references the books written by the two commanders who died in the 1980s. This gives a very vivid view of the battle, right on the ground watching as the 3-inch gun crews manage to blow up two Japanese destroyers who ventured too close to land.  We see the maneuvering during the second invasion, as Captain Wesley Platt manages to clear Wilkes island (one of the three islands that make up Wake Atoll) of all Japanese invaders, just prior to being ordered to surrender.  Sloan pulls no punches, with the occasional description of battle that is quite graphic, but he doesn't go overboard.  Instead, he makes it real.<br /><br />The book begins with the history of the Wake atoll, from its discovery until its use as a military base, culminating in the pre-war years of build-up through Pan-Am and the military.  This sets up the rest of the battle, as many of the civilian contractors who were on the island for this construction end up playing pivotal roles in the defense of the island.  Some of the most heroic men who died were the civilians who volunteered to do whatever they could to help the Marines who were dying for them.  Sure, some of the contractors fled to the jungle and survived on their own for two weeks, though strangely enough we never really hear about them again.  Sloan mentions them in passing, but we never know exactly what happened to them.  They were presumably killed, but if they were captured, Sloan never mentions them.  Most of the civilians, however, took part in the defense.<br /><br />Even more important than a detailed description of the battle, however, is the aftermath.  Sloan tells us about the horrifying sea voyage of some of the prisoners, from Wake to Japan and then to a camp near Shanghai, about the desolate conditions on the ship and the brutality of their captors.  There is no mention of any deaths on this voyage, except for the five who were beheaded up on the deck for no apparent reason (and Sloan states that the reason for this has never been revealed), so I'm not sure if that's glossed over or if it's just a fact that nobody died.  The journey was horrible, though.  Sloan also shows a few \\"good\\" Japanese soldiers, including Doctor Ozeki, who saved the life of Wiley Sloman back on Wake.  Sloman had taken a bullet in the head, and Ozeki eventually saved him.  None of the men had anything bad to say about him, and he even met with some of the survivors in 1995.  Ed Borne even called Ozeki his best friend after years of correspondence with him.<br /><br />In addition to all of this, Sloan examines the surrender and why it happened.  A relief fleet was sailing toward Wake, but it was going too slow because of both the slowest ship's speed and the ambivalence of the new temporary commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Pye, toward the relief effort.  Add this to the severed communications between the commanders of the Wake defense and the troops giving the commanders a wrong impression of what was going on and you get a recipe for a premature surrender.  Platt had cleared one island and was looking to go help on one of the others.  The Marines could probably have held out for two or three more days, but the relief convoy was aborted as soon as Commander Cunningham, commander of the garrison, indicated to the Pacific Fleet headquarters (in a cryptic, though dramatic message) that Japanese troops were on the island and the situation was grim.  What could have been a major American victory turned into another defeat.<br /><br />Given Up For Dead is a book that's hard to put down.  The book is well-researched, with most of the sources being interviews or the books written by men who fought there.  There are a few details missing, as mentioned above, but overall this is quite the comprehensive work.  It will keep any military history reader turning the page, and it is an important book for bringing to light a forgotten battle.  Everybody remembers the Alamo, but hardly anybody seems to remember the Alamo of the Pacific.<br /><br />David Royed Ozeki his best friend after years of correspondence with him.<br /><br />In addition to all of this, Sloan examines the surrender and why it happened.

Leading up to Star Trek: Nemesis, Riker has to consider the direction of both his personal and professional life.  As with A Time to Love, this was a short yet powerful book with a lot of character development and action.  Not only that, it sets the scene for the rest of the series, piling on a little Starfleet intrigue as well.<br /><br />The planet Delta Sigma IV is falling apart.  The Bader and the Dorset, with their natural aggressive instincts returned to them, are finding that one hundred years of peace has not prepared them for violence.  Instead, riots have broken out, murders are becoming very commonplace, and vandalism runs rampant.  Many blame the Federation, so they take it out on the Enterprise's security officers who are attempting to keep the peace.  Captain Picard is trying to buy time for Dr. Crusher to come up with a way to fix things.  Meanwhile, Commander William Riker has found his father, as Kyle Riker tries desperately to track down the person who committed the initial murder.  Tensions have always been high between the two men, but with Kyle suspected of some involvement in what's happened, these tensions grow ever stronger.  However, Kyle is just trying to rectify the mistakes he has made, and he tries to enlist Will to help him.  Will personal tensions between the two men keep them from fulfilling their mission?  And will Dr. Crusher be able to fix things before the entire planet erupts into chaos?<br /><br />A Time to Hate is only a minor let-down from the first book, mainly because the first book was so good.  There are a couple of minor issues with this one that bring it down a notch.  The first is the virtual disappearance of the native who has been leading Will around.  Once Will finds his father, Seer is not in the book anymore until the end, and I missed him.  The relationship that had developed between Will and Seer was interesting to read about, and I was sorry he was gone.  I was worried that he had been completely forgotten until he showed up at the end.  I suppose he would have detracted from the arguments that Will and Kyle had, but he would have been a more interesting companion than Bison was.  I just found Bison annoying, and even more so when he ultimately didn't have much to do with the ending of the book.  Incidentally, Bison is the other minor strike against the book.<br /><br />As with A Time to Love, characterization is the strength of this book.  All of the regulars are once again wonderfully portrayed, especially the Rikers.  The conversations between them were great, relating back to the episode of The Next Generation in which Kyle appeared, as well as the book Deny Thy Father.  Will is having a hard time forgiving the man for all those years of feeling abandoned as a child, but he slowly comes to realize exactly where Kyle was coming from.  Their personalities still clash, but it's nice to see the relationship that develops.  What happens between the two men cause Riker to think about a lot of other personal issues, especially his relationship with Deanna Troi.  The ending of the book is marvelous (though the climax is clich&eacute;d), with some quiet scenes that lead into the next book, setting up both the Riker/Troi relationship as well as Riker's professional choices.  We also see some of Deanna's side to this, but this is really Riker's book.<br /><br />Not as well-done as the Rikers, though still very good, was Dr. Crusher.  She has to make a decision about taking over the position of head of Starfleet Medical, which would mean leaving the Enterprise and Picard.  She agonizes over whether to tell Picard of the offer, as well as whether or not to take it.  Beverly is still unsure what her relationship with Picard actually is, which makes the decision all the harder.  I liked the way thebook left this, and I look forward to how the last three books finally deal with this.  There will be some stress there, especially considering how Picard found out about the opportunity.<br /><br />Even with all this, Greenberger has time to develop a few minor characters as he uses them to illustrate the situation on the planet.  Security Chief Vale comes into her own as she organizes everything, hurting with every loss of security personnel (though again, Greenberger avoids the clich&eacute; of having every security officer given any characterization killed off).  Some of the engineering staff are also given multiple dimensions, as they beam down to fix some of the infrastructure on the planet and have to deal with their own personal issues.  The combination of characterization and plot is especially good in these instances.  Because they are minor characters, they *can* die, but they don't always, and Greenberger gives us enough information so we actually care if they do or not.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a couple of clich&eacute;s in the book.  The climax is one of them, and the other is that of \\"the doctor saves the day when nobody else could figure it out.\\"  However, this is mitigated a little bit because it's not a perfect cure, and there are some moral issues to it.  This not only makes for interesting drama, but it also may add some spark to the Picard/Crusher issue that's clearly brewing.  Add that to the ending where we find out that not all is rosy in Starfleet as the Federation recovers from the Dominion War, and you get a top notch book.<br /><br />A Time to Hate is the perfect ending to this part of the series.

US	50332419	RQBIKTZV0NK2I	0743462858	154624477	A Time to Love (Star Trek: the Next Generation)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A decision point has come	A Time to Love, by Robert Greenberger, is the fifth book in the Time to... series of Star Trek: The Next Generation novels, taking place immediately before the movie Star Trek: Nemesis.  The first four books were up and down affairs, wallowing in Trek continuity and occasionally telling a good story.  A Time to Love, however, is the first one that's been fully satisfying.  It is rather lightweight, but for some reason it packs a punch.  It begins the story of how William Riker, first officer of the Enterprise, finally finds himself with a command of his own after all these years under Captain Picard.  While concentrating on this and his relationship with Deanna Troi, the book also tells a great story too.<br /><br />A Time to Love is a short book (263 pages), but somehow Greenberger packs a lot into it.  The first ten pages are a little slow as he summarizes what's happened so far in the series, but he does it in an interesting fashion:  having Troi and Riker going through crew transfer applications, commenting on what's happened so far and how it's affecting morale.  This scene is also important as it begins the realization, carried throughout this book and the next, that Riker has to finally make a decision about his life.  He's 42 years old, he and Troi have rekindled their romance (in the movie Insurrection, but they haven't moved forward. Just what is he waiting for?  Plus, he has turned down many command opportunities to stay with Enterprise, but is that still the right thing to do?  I've never seen such an effective summary before, giving us new information even as it goes over old.  Some of the later scenes, such as Geordi's, do slow down and tell us too much about the past without anything happening, but those scenes are not very long.<br /><br />The characterization in this book is wonderful.  Riker and Troi get the most, but everybody else is great too.  Picard is getting fed up with the boring missions that he's been given, mainly to keep Enterprise out of the spotlight and allow time for the furor to die down.  Picard feels put upon, and he wishes for a mission that he can sink his teeth into.  The Delta Sigma IV mission turns out to be just what he asked for, but perhaps too much.  His frustration when the ruling council on Delta Sigma IV is frozen with indecision is palpable, as his annoyance with himself when he realizes that he hasn't kept on top of the situation on the Enterprise very well during the mission.  Crusher's indecision about the offer to head Starfleet Medical is hanging over her head, and she keeps coming to the realization that she and Picard will never have a romantic relationship and she must also look to her career.  In the meantime, though, she is determined to do as much to help the people on the planet below as she is able.<br /><br />Even better are the scenes with the various security officers as they try to quiet the situation down on the planet before it escalates into even more violence.  We get scene after scene of these officers doing their job, many of which look like they're going to end with the typical \\"red shirt\\" ending, but they don't always.  This makes the scenes that *do* contain something bad even more effective.  Greenberger writes these scenes with tension, keeping the reader entranced to know what will happen next.  These scenes also give wonderful characterization to Lt. Vale, the security chief who is responsible for all of these men and women.  Greenberger perhaps has too many times where he says that Vale would give her life for Picard, over-emphasizing it a little bit, but overall her characterization is quite good.<br /><br />Kyle Riker doesn't figure a lot in this book, except by his absence and the effect of the search for him on Will.  These scenes are extremely effective, with Will contemplating what barriers that have been in the way of the reconciliation of him and his father, as well as taking stock of his life.  Riker is taken on his search by one of the natives and they visit the man's home as well, emphasizing just what Riker has been missing all these years.  While being full of action and conflict (emotional and violent), the book makes a very effective character study of Will, as well as the other regulars.  I found it incredibly entertaining to read.<br /><br />The only weak spot in the novel (and this may just be setting up something for the next few books) is the Geordi and Data story, where Geordi has to scrounge for parts by trading with various other starships in the area like some supply sergeant.  Data suggests that Geordi become a true supply sergeant by getting everybody's inventory and seeing what they have and what they need, facilitating the delivery of these parts through a Ferengi trader.  This subplot doesn't appear to have anything to do with anything except to give these two major characters something to do.  I hope that changes, but in this book they felt forced into the story, and as short as it is, I think the other storylines could have been developed a bit more.<br /><br />Still, that is the only true fault.  A Time to Love flows very nicely, flying by as you read it.  The prose isn't wonderful, but it's greatly functional, serving its purpose and getting out of the way.  These are the characters I know and love, and Greenberger manages to tone the angst down considerably.  No mean feat in this series so far.

Joe Queenan is a very funny writer.  Every one of his books that I have read, I have enjoyed.  He often brings his wit to the entertainment industry, but also attacks pop culture, especially those items of it that he feels are truly atrocious.  In Queenan Country, Queenan takes on Britain, but not in the way you might think.  He married an Englishwoman back in the 1970s, and thus he has made many trips to England to see relatives.  However, he has not really experienced all that Britain has to offer, as he has done the same thing every visit.  Thus, he decides that he must make a solo pilgrimage, without his wife or any other family, and immerse himself in British culture.  Will it survive?  Will he finally be able to truly understand the British mindset?  This is that story.<br /><br />Queenan obviously has great affection for Britain, even as he is not averse to criticizing the culture for what he feels are its faults.  This affection shows through in many passages, from the chapter on British literature to the wonderful day he had after taking a spontaneous late-night train ride.  He's also very complimentary about the British customs, such as always offering a guest something to eat.  Sometimes the affection shines through the writing, even when he's criticizing.  Other times, he just comes out and says it.<br /><br />Queenan covers a lot of topics in this book (\\"It is not a travel book per se, as travel books are dull.\\")  Instead of doing the typical travel book style, he talks about various aspects of British culture as they relate to where he goes.  He begins by discussing the British as a people, starting by saying that the term \\"British\\" has no precise meaning.  He gets into a discussion about national identity and then morphs into the different ways that the British treat their legends, compared to Americans.  This is embodied in his quest to rehabilitate Paul McCartney.  Queenan goes on a tour of Beatles country, taken by a rather unique cab driver who makes Queenan's day with wild stories, but he ends up altering Queenan's view of the whole thing.  Included in this chapter are asides about British cathedrals (one of which he visits to get the \\"cultural compulsories\\" out of the way before doing the things that truly interest him).<br /><br />This is just one of the examples of the fluid way that Queenan writes.  He can go off on a tangent occasionally, but he always ends up relating that tangent back to what he was talking about in the first place.  It's truly marvelous to see him start off talking about weird British history and then moves on to a story about Paul McCartney.  He can begin talking about the wonders of Scotland and then quickly go off on British theater as he takes in a play in Edinburgh.  He even refers back to previous books, as he references both Red Lobster, White Trash, and the Blue Lagoon (when he talks about something not sucking as much as he thought it would) and True Believers (where he reiterates a story about a rugby match).  This time, he didn't insult anything that I really like, but even if he ends up doing it, he writes with such panache that you can't help but laugh with him anyway.  There are plenty of acerbic comments that aren't about the British, too.  He has quite a few references to Americans (\\"By contrast, even the most appalling Americans are comfortable with themselves.  Americans don't mind being appalling.\\"), but also the French, Japanese, and others.  Of course, he saves most of his comments for the British. In fact, one of his chapter titles is \\"10 Things I Hate About Britain.  No, Make that 20.\\"  Even most of these, however, are things that I would think a lot of British people probably hate too, so it's not a slam against the people.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about the book is that you just might learn something as well.  Queenan talks about history, giving some facts that not everybody may be aware of.  He visits a number of historical sites (one of my favourites was his visit to a piece of Hadrian's Wall), and in so doing gives some historical insight to the whole thing.  Any true historian will already know most of it, but it would still be informative to those who haven't really paid much attention to history.  He does the same thing for almost everything British, which informed me a lot too.  I've never been to Britain (though I'd like to go someday), so I loved hearing about all the different places Queenan went.  He wasn't afraid to go into the less touristy spots, either.  He went to a concert put on by an Eagles tribute band, Talon, and actually had some nice things to say about them.<br /><br />The cover of the book is a nice homage to Abbey Road, with Queenan fulfilling all the parts (of course!).  I hesitate to admit that the pun in the title completely flew over my head until I was almost done with the book, but now that I have noticed it, it's very clever.  All in all, the book is quite a treat.  It's less acerbic than some of Queenan's other books, so even if that has turned you off of his books in the past, you might want to give this one a scan at the book store.  Even so, it's still as witty as any of Queenan's other books, and I'm finding that I like it more and more as I think back on it to write this review.  With more love than I'm used to from Queenan, I think Queenan Country is probably among his best.<br /><br />David Royf my favourites was his visit to a piece of Hadrian's Wall), and in so doing gives some historical insight to the whole thing.

US	50332419	R2IVI3FHPC2LQT	0563538694	61933614	The Domino Effect (Doctor Who)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Brutal world, brutal book	Another Doctor Who novel, another alternate universe?  Sadly, this will become the norm, as the current storyline is *about* alternate universes.  As begun in The Infinity Race and Time Zero, alternate universes are springing up all over the place.  This just adds another burden to a story that takes place in a continuing series, as we have to be given a reason to care about any of the characters in it, as we know it's not going to \\"matter\\" to the story in general.  Otherwise, it's just going through the motions.  Sadly, Bishop fails in this, as I didn't care about *any* of the characters, sometimes not even the continuing ones.<br /><br />It's hard to decide where to begin on The Domino Effect.  Characterization takes a back seat to imagery in the book, with none of the incidental characters eliciting anything other than disgust or boredom from this reader.  The bad guys are super bad, moustache-twirling evil minions (Hastings is the worst), and the good guys are sniveling dweebs (except Dee, who is a violent good guy, thus not necessarily twirling her moustache).  Instead, we're given an almost brutal book.  Hastings, the main character who interacts with Fitz, is just sadistic and nothing else (except when he turns into a sniveling dweeb).  All of the scenes with Fitz consist mainly of beatings and torture in some fashion and that's about it.  There's a point to Fitz's captivity, though he ultimately doesn't really do anything except introduce us to a character who becomes important elsewhere.  But the beatings?  They're overdone.  The atmosphere of the world has the same brutality, and Bishop constantly lets us know how oppressive everything is, sometimes to a fault.<br /><br />All of this is being done in the name of stopping progress.  There is a nice confrontation at the end spelling everything out, identifying just what the purpose of the scenes taking place in the past (where various instances of potential technological advances are nipped in the bud) is and how they interact.  However, this scene suddenly takes a sharp left turn into the realm of technobabble that really doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  I'm still not sure what the other prisoner has to do with the whole thing.  This technobabble goes on for pages at the end, trying to explain the whole plot, and worse:  trying to set up subsequent books.  This does not make me feel good.<br /><br />Are there other silly aspects to this book?  Of course there are.  How about a policeman who's conveniently forgetful, who just happens to be the one policeman who runs into the Doctor and his cohorts.  Gee, isn't it nice that he's so forgetful that he doesn't remember seeing the Doctor and Anji's pictures on the \\"Britain's Most Wanted\\" television show?  Not to mention the briefing I'm sure he received just that morning!  Nope, doesn't remember them.  But gee, the Doctor sure looks familiar.  Maybe he saw him on the telly!  I'm sure Bishop thought this was a cute scene, but trust me, it wasn't.  Not to mention the fact that the police force in this \\"timeline\\" is so brutally efficient that there's no way this person would be on the force.  Whatever shred of my disbelief that was left suspended, the fraying rope finally snapped.  This was absurd.<br /><br />Even worse, however, is Anji's complete *stupidity* in not knowing that something was wrong when she first arrives.  She blunders through the first 50 or so pages, weathering all the overt racism, the scorn heaped on her when she does things like ask where the ATM machines are and tries to pay with money that has the Queen's picture on it instead of the King's.  Anji is not an idiot, but you certainly couldn't tell from the beginning of this book.  The TARDIS crew has just been through an adventure where the universe starts splitting, and their last adventure was *in* an alternate universe.  You'd think she'd twig to the fact that this wasn't her 2003.  But no, she doesn't.  She keeps forcing her way through.  Gee, great portrayal of the real Edinburgh there, David, that she might actually believe that this *is* the real Edinburgh for any length of time whatsoever.  There is one line that attempts to rationalize this (blaming it on being shaken by her first encounter with the racism), but it doesn't wash.  Even shaken, she is smarter than that.<br /><br />So what did Bishop get right?  Not a whole lot in this case.  The book begins with a flashback sequence for Anji, even though the Doctor & Fitz's scenes are told in the \\"present,\\" but this only goes for about 50 pages and then disappears.  It doesn't really work, but the rest of the prose is ok.  Fitz is ok for what he does, though unless it has some ramifications for him in other books, it doesn't really work.  He should lose some of his gung-ho attitude after his treatment in this book.  If not, then Fitz becomes even less than useless.  The Doctor doesn't really do a whole lot, but the final confrontation (before the technobabble virus hits) is quite well-done.  Heather is also mildly interesting, though there turns out to be a reason for this that is, sadly, predictable.  Until she turns into a pod person, she's actually an effective character, though that could be because she's the only true character in this book.  There are multiple betrayals in this book, but none of them work because I didn't care about them at all.<br /><br />Unless you're a completist, give this one a miss.<br /><br />David RoyGee, great portrayal of the real Edinburgh there, David, that she might actually believe that this *is* the real Edinburgh for any length of time whatsoever.

US	50332419	R2RHERN7MJDHVE	0563486090	366226519	Wolfsbane (Doctor Who)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	There's a wolf at the door, and it's coming for Harry!	Wolfsbane does something that not a lot of Doctor Who stories do:  explore the question of what would happen if one of the companions got left in a time period when the Doctor and the others take off again.  This means a bit more in the era of the Fourth Doctor, when the TARDIS wasn't as controllable as it became in later seasons.  However, Rayner gives him a bit of control to make the story feasible.  Wolfsbane is one part werewolf horror novel and one part comedy of manners in the English aristocracy.  The meeting of the two is sometimes ingenious and sometimes jarring, but always at least slightly interesting.<br /><br />One of the strengths of this book is the beautiful characterization of the regular cast, at least for the most part.  The Fourth Doctor, notoriously hard to \\"get\\" in a novel (Tom Baker's performance on television is hard to catch in prose form), is actually pretty good. He's moody at times, always quick with an absurd witticism when it seems appropriate.  The escape from the scientists' lab is one beautiful sequence showing the Fourth Doctor at his best.  However, there are times where he seems a little too distant.  He barely seems to register the fact that they've left Harry behind, and Sarah's understandably angry with him.  However, while the Fourth Doctor is decent, the Eighth Doctor is wonderful.  This adventure takes place, as far as he is concerned, during his 100 years stranded on Earth, with his TARDIS slowly growing back from a featureless blue box and with no memories of who he is or what he was (explaining his not knowing Harry), Rayner captures him beautifully.  Especially noticeable is the need to fight evil wherever it is, even if he doesn't quite know why he must do so.<br /><br />However, this is not either Doctors' book.  Instead, it is Harry and Sarah's.  Harry is the perfect person to be stuck in a \\"proper\\" English household, always trying desperately to do the right thing, use the right spoon, and not intrude on private moments.  He even has the language down, with \\"very good of you...but, mustn't intrude - house of mourning and all that.\\"  He and George Stanton make a wonderful pair for dialogue when they're in a scene together.  Harry's comfortable allowing the Doctor to lead the way in the investigation into what's going on, but he keeps having doubts that this is *his* Doctor and so has trouble trusting him at times.  Harry blunders along, trying to avoid the passes that Emmeline Neuberger, a German woman who appears to be looking for a man so she can stay in England, and Harry would make the perfect match.  He shows a wonderful mixture of intelligence and naivet&eacute; that is the hallmark of Harry.  Sarah, on the other hand, is determined, willful, and the perfect embodiment of what Lis Sladen brought to the role.  She is independent, but understandably scared when something really awful happens to her.  She's a wonderful character that springs off the page whenever she's on it.<br /><br />The plot is a smorgasbord of stuff, from werewolves to Arthurian legends, along with the aforementioned British aristocratic comedy, and the tone of the book is slightly off at times when Rayner doesn't seem to be able to control the mixture.  The scene transitions are jarring at times, from the dark foreboding of Sarah's search for the truth about Harry's death to the Stanton family and their stiff upper lip.  While the overall atmosphere is very well done, it doesn't always fit.  The other problem is one that may not be a problem for some.  This is a Doctor Who novel solidly in the horror/fantasy genre.  There is no rational explanation for any of the things that happen in the book.  Instead, all of the explanations are magical in some way, either nature spirits or the werewolves themselves.  If you're a Who fan that can't stand any kind of \\"magic\\" in your stories, you will hate this book.  Personally, I'm on the opposite side of the fence, but I think Wolfsbane went a bit too far toward themagical side.<br /><br />That doesn't take away from an otherwise excellent book.  The characterization, aside from the regulars, is rather spotty and thin, but the intricate plot and atmosphere shine off the page.  While reading, the plot doesn't really seem that intricate, but I loved how Rayner sometimes related the two different timelines; Sarah finds out something in her investigation and then we see the real story of what happened for that event with Harry.  This often makes up for the jarring transitions.  Especially atmospheric is the story of the Night of the Long Claws, where the Germans rounded up the werewolves, starved them, and then set them loose on a town outside Munich on the night of the full moon.  This chapter, told by the wolf, is exceptional, and well worth the read by itself.<br /><br />So, Wolfsbane does what it sets out to do:  tell an entertaining story with a good use of the Who regulars.  While it's not a standout, there are enough excellent bits in the story to definitely make this worth a read.<br /><br />David Roye magical side.  <br /> <br />That doesn't take away from an otherwise excellent book.

US	50332419	RAJ9CTFJCV2O5	0743483537	665765683	Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Vol. 3, The Dominion and Ferenginar	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Greed, power, religion.  Something's gotta give.	After reading \\"Olympus Descending,\\" the Dominion story in Worlds of Deep Space Nine: The Dominion & Ferenginar, I felt like I had been kicked in the gut.  This feeling was heightened when I realized that there is no new Deep Space Nine book out this year (the only one on the schedule, Hollow Men, takes place during the television series).  What a powerful ending to a fascinating series of stories.  \\"Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed,\\" the Ferengi story by Keith R.A. DeCandido, was also fun as well, but \\"Olympus Descending,\\" by David R. George III was the perfect capper to the whole series.  While quibbles can be made about both stories, none of these little nits can overshadow the fact that these were both great stories.  The future of Deep Space Nine is well in hand with these people in charge.<br /><br />DeCandido's \\"Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed\\" is a fun story, a calm before the storm right in between Volume 2's Bajoran story and \\"Olympus Descending.\\"  It does almost the exact opposite of what the other stories have done, as Quark is (albeit reluctantly) fighting to keep the changes that have already happened on Ferenginar.  Thus, this is a fight for the status quo, rather than a fight to change worlds as has happened in the other four stories of this series.  It's all the better for it, too, as there is some great comedy in it.  While I think Ferengi stories are able to have depth, I don't think they work if that depth is too out in the open, without a veneer of comedy.  The best Ferengi episodes (not many, I admit) always worked on two levels, and \\"Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed\\" is the same way.  There are some wonderful scenes between Quark and Rom, especially when the possibility of Rom's having signed a horrible marriage contract comes up and Rom admits to some things that he would rather not admit to.<br /><br />I think the story works for a number of reasons.  First, we don't have actors trying to act smarmy and speaking in annoying, sometimes squeaky voices.  That puts it a step above most episodes anyway.  However, that's not the only plus to this story.  DeCandido is able to examine not only Ferengi society, but the internal workings of individual Ferengi as well.  Thus, we see Quark's thoughts about what is happening on his home planet.  We see the fact that, while he hates what Rom has been doing to his world, the idea of Brunt being in charge is even worse.  DeCandido also avoids showing us a completely stereotypical Ferenginar, showcasing all businessmen as horrible people.  I think the show sometimes went too far that way, but DeCandido shows us some of the good in Ferengi society as well.  Thus, the story is very well-rounded.<br /><br />Even better, we get to see an outsider's view of the whole thing.  The television show went to Ferenginar once, and it was a pretty horrible episode, partially because it consisted entirely of Ferengi.  This time, Ro comes along to help out, and we get some wonderful scenes of her adapting to the planet.  Her reaction to the ads that can't be shut off that show Brunt grinning in extreme close-up was hilarious.  Even her reaction to the near-constant rain and humidity were very amusing.  She gives us that perspective that we really need so we don't get lost amidst all of the Ferengi avarice.  The fact that the story also deals with the developing relationship between Quark and her is also a plus. In fact, I think Ro is the best part about the book, though the other characterization is equally well-done.  This is excellent work, all the way around.<br /><br />\\"Olympus Descending,\\" on the other hand, ratchets up the tension and is consumed by a very foreboding atmosphere.  Yet that doesn't bring the story down at all, and in fact heightened my interest in it.  I loved the entire philosophical discussions between Odo and Laas, especially when Odo begins investigating Laas' question about why the 100 were sent out.  I won't reveal what answer Odo finds, but it brings up a lot more discussion of the nature of religion and the difference between faith and fact.  The beginning of the story can be a bit slow, and part of me wishes that George had switched to Taran'atar a little bit sooner at the beginning, but overall it's extremely interesting stuff that has far-reaching consequences for the Dominion, and perhaps the rest of the Deep Space Nine mythos as well.  The story ends up tying into Ben Sisko's dire warnings in \\"Fragments & Omens,\\" which is a good thing and will probably lead into the next series of books.<br /><br />If the Odo story is fascinating, the Taran'atar story is gripping.  We have seen this Jem'Hadar struggle with the mission Odo gave him since the relaunch began, and it's not getting any easier.  In fact, he's reached a point where he has to make a decision, but he can't do it without help.  He and Kira go on a journey that he hopes will help him decide, but it only makes things worse for him.  I've grown to like the character throughout all these books, and watching him go through this was almost agonizing, especially because I knew that something bad was going to happen (unfortunately, I also knew *what* was going to happen, as it had been spoiled for me).<br /><br />Since the Bajor story had also left one of its plots dangling, it wasn't so jarring this time as \\"Olympus Descending\\" does the same thing.  I think another reason for the difference in my thinking was because while \\"Fragments & Omens\\" just coasted to halt with that plot dangling, \\"Olympus Descending\\" was a true cliff-hanger.  The wait for the next book is now going to be excruciating.  In the meantime, the Worlds of Deep Space Nine books will sate your thirst.<br /><br />David Roylot more discussion of the nature of religion and the difference between faith and fact.

US	50332419	R7BABY4GDR3QY	0743483529	553142613	Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Worlds of Deep Space Nine #2: Trill and Bajor (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - World of Deep Space Nine) (No. 2)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Worlds in flux.	So far, the Worlds of Deep Space Nine books have been very good.  Volume two, which contains \\"Unjoined\\" (about Trill) and \\"Fragments & Omens\\" (about Bajor) continues the strong showing from Volume 1.  This time, though, both stories are extremely strong.  \\"Unjoined\\" is by Andy Mangels & Michael A. Martin, while \\"Fragments & Omens\\" is by newcomer J. Noah Kym (though that is a pseudonym, so maybe the author isn't that new?).  As with Volume 1, one of the stories is fairly quiet while the other one has huge ramifications for the planet involved.  Both are excellent, with only the Bajor story leaving me slightly wanting, but in this case that can be a good thing.<br /><br />Both of these stories are powerful in their own way.  \\"Unjoined\\" hits you in the gut and keeps doing it as you need to find out what's going on.  As the violence escalates, we wonder if there will be a Trill society left for Dax to save.  There's also a great deal of tension between Bashir and Ezri, and the authors handle this very deftly.  All throughout the story, I was wondering if the tension was from what was going on around them or if it was internal to them.  It was definitely interesting to watch.<br /><br />Mangels & Martin show us an intriguing look at a world under siege by terrorists, though these terrorists have a point.  The government *is* hiding something from them all, part of which has been established way back in the television series, but some other information that's just in the books as well.  The story is very dark and downbeat, which is unusual for them.  However, dark does not mean bad in this case.  When the terrorists do something truly horrifying, I felt my gut clench a little bit.  The finale, which is a harbinger for massive change on Trill, leaves any long-term reader of the re-launch (or even a fan of the television series) wondering what will become of this world.<br /><br />The entire story is gripping, with the only real fault being that the sequence where Dax is trying to find the answers to what happened in ancient Trill history drags on a little too long (despite being interrupted by other, more interesting scenes).  It's nothing major, but I do wish that Mangels & Martin had avoided using the \\"a character is in an environmental suit, so something has to go wrong with it\\" clich&eacute;.  They do make good use of it, however, as in the process of being saved, she encounters the horror of what the terrorists have finally done.  The story also starts in the middle of the action and then backtracks.  While this can be annoying at times (and is overused in televised Trek), I think it was put to good use here.  It draws us into the story and bridges what could have been a slow beginning otherwise.  This story is definitely a keeper.<br /><br />\\"Fragments & Omens\\" has a lot of pluses and minuses, mostly pluses.  It sets up a large part of what is probably going to follow in the next sequence of books, with Ben Sisko warning about the coming of the Ascendents (a race of beings that even the Founders may fear).  The tone of the story alternates between dark foreboding (Sisko's warning, not to mention the destruction of the village) and somewhat lighter fare (Jake's story).  Kym handles this change in tone very deftly, however, never leaving the reader reeling.<br /><br />Jake's story is very sweet, and told from the point of view of Rena, a woman that he meets in a Bajoran village. The romance is quite sweet, but the story does even more by giving us a layman's view of how Bajor is being integrated into the Federation.  We see the common person's point of view, the worry about how all of a sudden there is no money, whether the Federation will rob Bajor of its core values and what life will be like within rather than as an outsider.  There is nervousness there, understandable given the massive change that is coming.<br /><br />What I found the most interesting part of the story, however, was the interaction between Ro and Cenn, a Bajoran major who is very leery of the Federation and what it represents.  Thousands of Bajoran militia members are leaving to join Starfleet now that the opportunity is there, and he feels that Bajor may lose a lot of its uniqueness.  He also doesn't like what Ro did, abandoning Bajor to the Cardassians to join Starfleet.  The tension between them is very nicely done, and I see great things ahead for the Cenn character.<br /><br />One major annoyance with this story, however, is that the story feels unfinished.  The first three stories, while leaving vast changes in the worlds' societies that will have to be dealt with, actually finished the story they were telling.

George III hasn't been the most prolific Star Trek writer, but he has been one of the most effective recently.  With two wonderful Deep Space Nine books to his credit (Mission Gamma: Twilight and co-authorship with Armin Shimmerman of The 34th Rule), he has rapidly become somebody who I *must* check out when I see his name on a Trek book.  In Serpents Among the Ruins, part of the Lost Era series of Trek books, George does yet another great job, this time rehabilitating the character of Captain John Harriman, captain of the Enterprise B (seen in the movie Star Trek: Generations).  In the movie, he's kind of an inexperienced dweeb, lessened in order to make Captain Kirk seem that much greater.  George obviously wanted to do something about that, and he's created a book with wonderful characters and a tense atmosphere.<br /><br />This story pretty much has everything a Trek fan could want:  Klingons & Romulans, interesting Federation characters (including Demora Sulu, our favourite Sulu's daughter), tension, a little bit of humour, and a huge action sequence.  It also provides us with an early look at Elias Vaughn, who later (in the Deep Space Nine relaunch series) becomes first officer of the station.  Having become very familiar with Vaughn from the Deep Space Nine series, it was interesting to see how he started out.  How much has he changed?  This is his first field mission for Starfleet Intelligence, so we do get a lot of nervousness and a little bit of angst when something happens that he's never done before.  While I did find the angst a little annoying at times (while realistic, I thought the book dwelled on it just a bit much), Vaughn is an interesting character who we want to learn a lot more about.<br /><br />The most impressive thing about the book, however, is Harriman.  As I said, the only exposure to Harriman that most of us have received is in Generations, and it's not a good one.  There is also Peter David's The Captain's Daughter, but I read that so long ago that I have no idea how he was characterized in it.  It's now eighteen years later, and Harriman has become a very skilled commander, well-loved by his crew and respected by Starfleet admirals (except his father, which really becomes an issue in the book).  He's also extremely interesting to read about.  At times, his introspection goes on a bit too long, but most of the time it's very enjoyable to get inside his thought processes.<br /><br />The rest of the characterization is done extremely well too.  Sulu is Harriman's first officer (she was just a new helmsman in the movie, but she became first officer about ten years ago) and we get a lot of insight on her, as well as some on her relationship with her father (in hindsight, though, as Sulu does not appear in the book).  When she has to take over the ship, she shows that she's ready for a command as well.  The Romulans are distinct and very intriguing, and the Klingon political intrigue is extremely well-done, though sometimes the Klingon politics doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the book. This may lead into the next Lost Era book, which deals with the Klingons and Cardassians a few years in the future, so it's not a major point.  Even the rest of the bridge crew for Enterprise have enough character hooks to make them interesting, even if they aren't truly three-dimensional.  All the way around, characterization is one of George's strong points.<br /><br />The other strength is the way the book is written.  The chapters are a countdown to the incident itself, adding to the tension and making the reader want to keep going.  The prose is extremely good for a Trek novel, bringing the reader deeper into the story with every page (and you have to keep turning that page).  George handles both the quiet moments and the inevitable action sequences with equal aplomb.  The last hundred pages are pulse-pounding, as Harriman's plan comes to fruition but obstacle after obstacle seems to keep getting inthe way.  I had to stop for breath when I finally reached the end of this section, it had me that riveted.  Finally, I have to give him credit for painting a bullseye on the forehead of a character and then *not* killing him/her off!  In fact, George does the exact opposite.  Bravo!<br /><br />The only problem with this book is that there is some repetition of little plot details that isn't really necessary.  I know this happened a few times, but the most prominent is the condition that befalls Ensign Fenn.  George has Sulu tell us about it in her thoughts at least twice, both times in great detail.  There are other times where George does the same thing with information, compelling me to say to myself \\"we already know this, can we move on?\\"  While this could be seen to emphasize how important something is, Fenn's condition doesn't really affect the plot much (which also indicates that the subplot could have been cut).  It became a bit annoying at times, but I was quickly engulfed in the story once again and forgot about it.<br /><br />Serpents Among the Ruins makes use of a lot of Trek history, which could be a good thing considering there are none of our \\"favourite\\" characters in it.  Thankfully, George doesn't hit us over the head with continuity explanations.  Instead, he gives us a solid tale that you will want to race through to see what happens next, but at the same time you'll want to read it slowly so you can savour it.  Personally, I raced.  I can't help it.  It was that good.<br /><br />David Roytting in the way.  I had to stop for breath when I finally reached the end of this section, it had me that riveted.

US	50332419	R13D5564OFX0QY	0743463838	176039067	3: The Genesis Wave Book Three (Star Trek: the Next Generation)	Books	1	6	6	N	N	The sequel that should never have been written	What do you do when you have written a really great two-book series full of galactic destruction and adventure?  If you're John Vornholt, you churn out a third book as a sequel to them (granted, it may very well have been the publisher's idea, but he could always have said no).  Genesis Wave: Book 3 is everything that the first two books weren't:  boring, plodding, with bad characterization and large stretches where nothing interesting happens.  It is not only entirely forgettable, but it's also inconsequential.<br /><br />The Genesis threat has been neutralized with the help of the Romulans and almost the entirety of Starfleet.  However, the problems are not over.  While the cleanup begins, the Enterprise discovers that the Genesis Wave has weakened the boundaries between our universe and another one, allowing horrifying creatures to bridge the gap.  A massive rip in space does not bode well for the Federation's survival, especially because this isn't the only rift out there.  Meanwhile, on a backwater mining planet, a Bajoran Prylar (similar to a lower-level priest or monk) is given what turns out to be a portable Genesis device.  Believing it to be the Orb of Life, he is determined to use it for the good of his people, no matter what the true consequences will be.  Aided by a Ferengi, a few Bajorans, and an enigmatic Vulcan, this Prylar could very well cause a lot more suffering than he thinks he will cure.  But will the Romulans kill anybody they have to in order to get a hold of this final device?<br /><br />It's almost hard to begin, there is so much wrong with this.  First, the characterization is way off.  Weird romance passages abound (Vornholt seems to have been bitten by the Christie Golden bug, as he describes many characters as \\"stunning\\") and even when the romance angles are a bit more understandable, they are stilted an obvious.  One of Crusher's patients falls in love with her, but Crusher is acting like a jealous fishwife because of the way Picard is acting with the Romulan commander on the other ship.  Picard's actions are made clear later in the book, but Crusher's are never really explained.  In all their years of working together, they have been attracted to each other, but she's never acted this way.  This book takes place between Insurrection and Nemesis, and there's no hint in either one of these movies that would allow for Crusher to act like she does in this book.  Troi and Riker aren't nearly as bad, but some of their scenes together really grated on my nerves as well.  There are times where they don't act like the professionals they are.  Even Vornholt's characters are not immune to this.  The Romulan commander has a hold on Picard's emotions (I won't say how, for fear of spoiling) but, for some reason, she has a scene where she tells the sleeping Picard that she really loves him.  It's never referred to again.<br /><br />The rest of the book introduces characters that I, for the most part, cared nothing about.  The book seems to be a showcase for a new series that never actually started, of \\"Genesis Warriors,\\" or at least warriors who banded together to fight the Genesis threat.  There's the Vulcan priestess, the Romulan who has a secret, the defected Romulan who is a Starfleet admiral's agent, a Ferengi, and a shape-shifter (not a Founder).  Sounds like a super-hero team, in a way, even down to them having a strong leader who gives them missions in Admiral Nechayev.  My first understanding was that Genesis Force would be their first (and last) adventure, but I recently discovered that Genesis Force takes place concurrently with this three-book series, so that's not true.  Even so, it does look like the \\"premiere issue,\\" even going so far as to really ignore the Enterprise crew for long periods at a time.<br /><br />Then there's the completely unnecessary references to Vornholt's Gemworld TNG series of books.  The characters (especially Troi) keep wondering if the rift is something similar to whathappened on Gemworld.  It's never definitively answered (and if so, I was so bored I missed it) and even if it was answered, it really had no bearing on the plot.  If there's anything I hate more than the overuse of continuity, it's the overuse of *useless* continuity.  Vornholt at least doesn't take large portions of the book to explain what happened on Gemworld, but he comes close.  Another use of continuity I had to laugh at is what ends up being the Romulan plan (and I shall say no more in fear of spoilage).<br /><br />Other strangeness abounds as well.  The entire Picard plot thread, though clear to the reader before this happens, is revealed to the characters in about two sentences as soon as Nechayev boards the Enterprise in a completely anti-climactic moment that allows them to plan a commando mission on to the Romulan ship.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about the book is that the atmosphere is pretty well done.  The excavation of the lab on Lomar, where all of the dead and dying bodies taken over by the moss creatures in the previous books reside, is quite chilling and oppressive at times, mirroring exactly how it would feel to work in that environment.<br /><br />Other than a few odd moments here and there (like Lomar), I had to really struggle with this book.  It reads very quickly, just like the first two books do, but yet it's also a struggle to get through as you the plot gets more and more outlandish.  The worst thing is that this book was *completely* unnecessary!  The first two books were so good, but this one almost cheapens them.  I say almost, because thankfully this book is not necessary for the enjoyment of those two.  It can be completely ignored, and probably should be.<br /><br />David Royhappened on Gemworld.

US	50332419	R3I6BJ4QHSMR8O	0743411838	220356746	2: Genesis Wave: Book Two (Star Trek: The Next Generation)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Not exactly the Garden of Eden	The second book of the Genesis Wave series continues the rollicking ride that the first book gave us, though it's not quite as tight as I would have liked.  We still have the galactic destruction, but this book is much more character-based, taking some of the characters in directions that are a little more absurd than I would have liked, but still enjoyable.  The ending is predictable (though the method isn't necessarily), and the story is weakened by what turns out to be multiple scenes of monster slaughter.  At times, the book felt like a variation on Dawn of the Dead, and lost a little bit of its luster because of it.  Still, it was quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Vornholt once again has some good characterization of the regulars in this book.  Maltz and Brahms are the highlights here, as they add a lot of fun to a rather downbeat book otherwise.  That Vornholt does this without making the Klingons caricatures is even more of an achievement.  Instead, they stay true to their Klingon heritage, trying to die with honour and taking as many of the enemy with them as possible.  They look down on the humans as soft (one amusing scene has Maltz on a Federation ship trying to get *uncomfortable* in the captain's chair because it shouldn't *be* comfortable), but they develop a healthy respect for Dr. Brahms, mainly because she realizes she has to be just as gruff and harsh as a typical Klingon captain.  Other than Maltz and Gradok, we don't really get a good sense of why the rest of the crew is following her.  That's a minor point, however.<br /><br />What's not quite as minor is one of the twists involving the Romulans, which I won't get into here other than asking:  for what possible purpose would the Romulans have a contingency plan in a fairly deserted area of space before any of this happens (we're talking a matter of days, so there's no way they could have set it up after the Genesis Wave began)?  There doesn't seem to be any point to it unless they somehow knew that this area would be important, but there's no indication of that.  This plot hole sets up the finale, which does cheapen it a little bit<br /><br />The other problem with the book is that it does, at times, become a monster hunt.  This hunt is related to the whole story, so it does serve a bit of a purpose, but on Myrmidon it doesn't seem to connect with the rest of the story.  Yes, these monsters are the same as are being dealt with elsewhere, but it only serves to give jeopardy to an already poignant storyline on Myrmidon, where all of these Bolians are trying to survive on a planet that's not really hospitable to them anymore.  That may have been an interesting story to tell.  These sequences also emphasize a \\"Super Data\\" that became a bit annoying at times.  Yes, I know Data is capable of leaping great distances, but picturing him bounding around, grabbing people and then jumping away again and again became a little silly.  All in all, the situation on Myrmidon did tend to distract from the rest of the book (though it did contain the classic line from Data, \\"Actually, you were trying to bite my face.\\"  Ok, you had to be there).<br /><br />What did I like about Genesis Wave: Book 2?  While I found them a bit far-fetched, I loved the Brahms/Klingon scenes.  They were just a lot of fun, filled with Klingon bluster and adventure.  Maltz is once again the highlight, either when he's swearing vengeance on Carol Marcus or when he's offering to pretend to be Leah's consort in order to protect her from any untoward advances from a crew member.  These scenes certainly aren't flawless, but my enjoyment of them outweighed any incredulity that I might have had for them.  Carol Marcus was also handled well, especially when she figures out that she's been duped, that Jim Kirk and her son are not really around her, and she must do whatever she can to stop the Wave from being unleashed again.  Again, there were a few bits here and there that didn't quite connect for me (I didn't buy how easily she was able to empty her thoughts so that her captors couldn't read them, for example), but I could put any faults aside for the sheer entertainment value and the strength of the characterization.  She's a woman who has the deaths of billions on her conscience, even though she was duped.  This guilt and determination to not let it happen again shines through.<br /><br />Genesis Wave: Book 2 is not as good, not as cohesive as the first book.  However, it is a fitting conclusion to a cosmic adventure.  I particularly liked how the ending is not all tied up in a neat little bow for the characters, though it is for the reader.  There are some questions that you know they will never be able to answer.  It's a nice change of pace.  This duology is definitely worth a look-see for any Trek fan.<br /><br />David Royidn't buy how easily she was able to empty her thoughts so that her captors couldn't read them, for example), but I could put any faults aside for the sheer entertainment value and the strength of the characterization.

US	50332419	RL2KDLLN6ZLC3	074341182X	662278591	1: The Genesis Wave Book One (Star Trek: the Next Generation)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	When "let there be light!" has a negative effect...	As a Star Trek books fan, I'm not one who likes books that dwell needlessly on series continuity.  I picked up the Genesis Wave books, by John Vornholt, because they looked interesting and they are another link from the Original Series (TOS) to the Next Generation (TNG).  I was hoping that it wouldn't be wallowing in continuity, and surprisingly, it doesn't.  Instead, we get a rollicking adventure (if you can call a book where millions, perhaps billions, of people die as \\"rollicking\\") that creates another tie to the old series but yet does something fresh.  Just a little bit of character whining detracts from an otherwise quite enjoyable book.<br /><br />Vornholt does a wonderful job of giving us just enough continuity to explain what's happening without going into excessive explanations about the whole thing.  I always wondered what had happened to the device after the Star Trek III movie, as it's never referenced again.  Sure, the planet was unstable and blew up, but that's it?  Vornholt takes what happened in the movies and extrapolates, giving us a horrifying force that is able to wipe out entire planets.  There is one chapter that is a report on the Genesis Device, from four different sources as Starfleet examines the ramifications of the entire project.  This gives enough background information for those who haven't seen the movies, but also gives additional information that even those who have seen it don't have, keeping it interesting. Otherwise, the continuity references are kept to a minimum, which I loved.<br /><br />The body count grows quite quickly, but it's abstract enough that it doesn't get overwhelming.  On the other hand, we do see, first-hand, the effects of the Wave, as Leah Brahms (the love of Geordi LaForge's life, though she doesn't know that) weathers it in a specially modified environmental suit that she was experimenting with for other reasons.  The descriptions of this can get a little graphic, but only in a PG-13 way.<br /><br />Vornholt also balances the personal and the cosmic pretty well, giving the reader a lot of character moments interspersed with the Wave itself.  Counselor Troi finds herself stuck on a planet taking readings of the Wave (in a modification of Brahms' suit) and also seeing it first-hand.  Riker has to do a last-minute rescue of Troi on another planet just before the Wave hits.  LaForge pines for Leah, as well as finding himself increasingly attracted to a geologist on board, Dolores Linton.  In fact, Geordi became the only annoying part of the book, as he was constantly thinking about Brahms, whining that she didn't know how he felt.  Or, later, wanting to tell her but unable to because her husband had just been killed by the Wave and she was after revenge.  Very human, but also annoying to read.<br /><br />One wonderful addition to the book is Maltz, the only Klingon to survive the events of Star Trek III.  It's now 90 years later and he's an embittered drunk.  He's never been able to live down what happened to him, being captured by Kirk & Company.  He's lived on the idea of vengeance against Carol Marcus since then, but when Leah meets him, he's just a drunk on an out-of-the-way Tellarite colony.  However, he recognizes Leah's description of the Genesis effect, and hitches a ride with her.  He becomes one of the more delightful characters, filled with gusto and energy, willing to follow Leah to the ends of the galaxy because he knows she feels the same way he does about the whole thing.  He gives a light edge to the whole thing, balancing out the enormous devastation in the book.  Of course, I had a hard time picturing John Larroquette playing him, but it *has* been 90 years.  Even better, Vornholt again gives us just enough information to know that *something* happened back then with Jim Kirk, but he doesn't spend two pages explaining the plot of Star Trek III.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are also well done, even if they don't stand out as exceptional.  I lovedthe relationship between Picard and Admiral Nechayev, mirroring perfectly what we saw in the series.  They exasperate each other some times, but both know that the other is good at his/her job and there is a great deal of respect there as well.  Riker & Troi are also handled well, given their relationship at the end of the movie Insurrection.  Good points all around for Vornholt on this basis.<br /><br />The plot seems simple at first, but Vornholt adds just enough intrigue to make it even better.  Ostensibly, the plot is just to stop the Wave and find out who is using it.  But little side-plots, some having to do with the main one and some tangents, are scattered all over, giving the book a lot more depth than it may seem to deserve. The tension is palpable, and the twists and turns are interesting and not *that* predictable.  It moves at a steady pace, which also makes for a quick read.  It's hard to put down.<br /><br />Vornholt, as an author, frustrates me sometimes.  He's either hit or miss for me.  His books in the Time to... series were really iffy, but this one is great.  Well worth a read for the Trek fan, and even a not bad one for the non-Trek one.<br /><br />David RoyI loved the relationship between Picard and Admiral Nechayev, mirroring perfectly what we saw in the series.

Having plundered World War II three times already, Harry Turtledove decides to go to the well once again with Days of Infamy.  This time, he goes to the Pacific Ocean, and wonders what would have happened if the Japanese had followed up their attack on Pearl Harbor with an invasion of Hawaii.  It's an interesting concept, but Turtledove is uncharacteristically dull in the exploration.  This book was an active chore to get through.<br /><br />The attack on Pearl Harbor happens much the same way as it did in the real history, so much so that Turtledove basically ignores it except in broad strokes.  The only change in the beginning of the book is that Japanese Commander Genda persuades Admiral Yamamoto to convince the Army generals that an invasion force should accompany the task force.  Once the attack has happened, though, things start to get interesting.  Hawaii is quickly captured as the Americans are unable to muster much of a defense.  They do make a heroic stand, however, before finally surrendering.  The rest of the book details life on the occupied islands, as well as introducing two characters further on in the book who give us the viewpoint of Americans who will be involved in the eventual re-taking of the islands.  In the course of the plot, Turtledove gives us a pilot who was shot down in the initial attack and is now a prisoner of war, a soldier who is also a POW, his estranged wife who has to live in an occupied city on Oahu, a surfer bum, and a Japanese family who have been living on the island for many years.<br /><br />The father, Jiro Takahashi, is an older Japanese man who will always consider himself Japanese.  He welcomes the invasion.  His sons have been Americanized, which causes a lot of family tension.  We are also given an assortment of Japanese military characters who are in various positions, though interestingly all of them are in the navy or are pilots from aircraft carriers.  We do not see the Japanese army point of view at all (though, in wonderful Turtledove fashion, we are told many, *many* times that the navy and the army don't get along).<br /><br />As usual, Turtledove does very well with the battle scenes.  When the fighting is going on, Turtledove is hard to beat, though he does include a very silly scene where two surfers are caught out in the water between the American defenders and the oncoming Japanese invasion force.  Don't worry, that scene is not included gratuitously.  It's an ongoing character moment for the surfer bum, Oscar Van Der Kirk, who talks many times of how he had an accident in his shorts during the incident.  The rest of the battle scenes are vivid and exciting, and even tragic as the Japanese wave just continues to wash over the islands with the American soldiers trying desperately to halt it, at least for a little while.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this battle ends fairly early in the book, giving us many interminable scenes of life on the occupied islands.  With the exception of the rare occurrence, all of these scenes are almost exactly the same.  We see Jiro and his sons, who argue (or fume silently) about their disagreement over whether the invasion was a good thing.  If we see Jane Armitage living in an occupied city, we're going to hear about how they have to grow what little they can to supplement their meager rations (we may read her thoughts on the execution she witnessed, too).  The scenes of the two POWs are almost the same, except the navy pilot's scenes also include repetition of how one man who only cares about himself has to be watched because he might sneak away from the work team, despite the Japanese promise to kill the rest of the team if anybody leaves.  Otherwise, they all talk about how hungry they are.<br /><br />Yes, Harry, we *get* it!  Life under occupation really stinks and it's almost impossible to survive on what little food you are given.  It's a valid issue, but come on!  Let's get the story moving, please?  The only time the story moves forward at all is when the Japanese characters are on the page, planning either the attack or how to defend the islands from an imminent attack.  That could be why they are also the most interesting characters in the book.  The Americans are given a couple of hooks to place a story on and then sent on their way, but the Japanese are pretty well done.  I could have done without the constant repetition (yes, I know this is getting repetitive) of how the POWs were sub-human and had no honour because they had surrendered, so they should consider themselves lucky for what meager supplies they received.  Again, a valid point, driven into the ground.<br /><br />Finally, I do have to give Turtledove credit for two things.  First, he mostly avoids the embarrassing sex scene (there is one, but it's not too bad and it actually builds a character a little bit).  Secondly, there's a bit of misdirection that I had to laugh at.  At the beginning, Fletch Armitage is introduced by saying he's extremely pale and he burns easily in the tropics.  I almost threw the book against the wall because we had yet *another* character like this!  However, there is only one other mention of this throughout the entire book.  You got me, Harry.  Good job.<br /><br />Days of Infamy is a great concept for a novel, but it is tedium interrupted by a few good battle scenes.  I usually blaze through a Turtledove book no matter how bad it is because the plot, at least, keeps me moving through it.  This one, I felt I was running in place throughout the book.  Only the page numbers told me I was getting anywhere.  That's not a good way to keep somebody reading.<br /><br />David Roye story moves forward at all is when the Japanese characters are on the page, planning either the attack or how to defend the islands from an imminent attack.

US	50332419	RYCSEOHV5A0EK	0765311321	291095927	The Life of the World to Come (Company)	Books	5	28	29	N	Y	A wrench named Alec is thrown into the works	Now that I'm caught up with Kage Baker's \\"Company\\" novels, waiting for the next one has been excruciating.  At the beginning of December, however, The Life of the World to Come was finally published, and it was well worth the wait.  Baker adds a lot more detail to the \\"Company\\" universe, telling us much more of the future than we even received in The Graveyard Game as we barrel toward the unknown event horizon of 2355, where not even Doctor Zeus Incorporated knows what happens.  For any fans of the Company, rest assured that this book is well worth reading.  If you're not familiar, then definitely don't start with this book.  While it is understandable (for reasons I'll get into later), you'll lose a lot of the richness of the plot.<br /><br />I was expecting this book to be mainly about Mendoza, and since I had not read the cover jacket, I was quite surprised when the book left her and never returned (except very briefly near the end).  Instead, we get the story of Alec, who has appeared in a few Asimov's stories but who I never really knew how he fit into everything.  The Life of the World to Come explains it all.  Were you bothered about how Mendoza always seemed to be meeting reincarnations of her old lover?  This book explains it quite rationally, making the Company seem even darker even as the scientists involved with his origin believe that they are doing good for the world.<br /><br />The book does a wonderful job of explaining everything and keeps up a good pace as well.  We see extended scenes of Alec while he's growing up and see how his personality is shaped by the strange, overly politically correct world that he's surrounded by, as well as the feeling that he was completely unwanted by his parents.  His only true friend is the Captain, a former computer playfriend that he reprogrammed to be the ultimate artificial intelligence and now his companion in everything he does.  He even goes so far as to get a cyborg implant so he can always be connected to the Captain.  Mixed in with these scenes so we never get too bored by too much Alec are the scenes with the scientists.  These are, at times, even better than the Alec scenes.<br /><br />Rutherford is a historian that wants desperately to return to the old times.  His ultimate goal is to recreate the Inklings, the writing group that Tolkein was a member of.  He and his companions, Frankie Chatterji and Foxen Ellsworth-Howard have fake wine, fake tea, a fire that only their service to Dr. Zeus allows them to have (fires are against the law).  They serve a couple of purposes in the book.  First, they explain Alec's background so the reader knows it before Alec does, along with explaining what happened with Mendoza in the 16th century and the 19th.  Secondly, they give us a little bit of insight into the company workings, or at least one side of it.  When they realize that the third incarnation of what they are doing is happening in real time (contemporary to them, rather than in the past), they get an odd thrill.  There's no way to know how it will turn out.  It makes them nervous, too, as Alec has already become too unpredictable for them.  Baker captures these scientists perfectly.  They have many idiosyncrasies like a lot of scientists have and each one is truly three dimensional.<br /><br />The star of the show, however, is Alec.  He is a very rich character and Baker is able to fully examine him.  He is damaged by the way he grew up, and he's even more damaged when he finds out the truth behind his childhood.  Baker never falters in her telling of the two intertwining stories, always capturing the reader's interest and moving on to the other story just when the reader needs a break.  The opening, told from Mendoza's point of view, gives us an update on how she's doing and becomes even more important when we see the same scenes from Alec's point of view later on.  For not being in the book much, we find ourselves caring even more about Mendoza as she does somethingthat leaves her in quite the precarious circumstance.<br /><br />For fans of Joseph and Lewis, Mendoza's fellow immortals, I'm sorry to say they are not in this one.  The way The Graveyard Game left off, that's too bad, but we must wait until the next one.  Baker is slowly building up to the event in 2355, and she's ratcheting up the tension as she goes.  The Life of the World to Come progresses the story a little bit, but it also fills in a lot of back detail.  It's clear that Alec will play an important part and so it's imperative we get to know him first.<br /><br />Both Baker's characterization and her plotting skills are on vivid display here.  Do yourself a favour and pick this book up.<br /><br />David Roysomething that leaves her in quite the precarious circumstance. <br /> <br />For fans of Joseph and Lewis, Mendoza's fellow immortals, I'm sorry to say they are not in this one.

US	50332419	R3U27UORQX9H75	074348780X	563079243	Star Trek: Strange New Worlds VII	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Fan fiction is coming up in the world...	In this seventh edition of the Strange New Worlds anthology series, we once again have the winners of the writing contest Pocket Books does every year for Star Trek stories.  Will some of these writers go on to become part of the stable of Trek writers for the ongoing series?  Perhaps, though I don't know if any of the stories in here justify that completely.  Still, there are definitely some good stories in here, well worth checking out.<br /><br />The stories are divided by the television series they are attached to, with another section called \\"Speculations.\\"  These are stories that are too broad to be tied to just one of the series.  Perhaps it's something that spans almost all the shows.  Or maybe they bring together elements from more than one series.  The other two stories in this section of Strange New Worlds VII don't really fit this concept, however, as one deals with a Dax, from Deep Space Nine (though it is a future Dax) and one deals with Picard and the history of the Borg.  Still, the stories are a bit broader than just \\"another adventure with the crew of the Enterprise,\\" so maybe that's why.<br /><br />The grand prize winner was the Next Generation story, \\"Life's Work,\\" by Julie A. Hyzy.  This is the story of Data's creator, Noonian Soong, and the time when his wife finally left him because he was too wrapped up in his work.  He was working on a final emotion chip that he would be able to put in Data when a crisis in his marriage happens.  His wife, Juliana, has determined to leave him because he's more married to her work rather than to her.  The weird thing is (as established in one of the Next Generation episodes), Julianna is actually an android that Noonian fashioned after his real wife died, because he couldn't bear to be without her.  He made her a perfect copy of his wife, so much so that she doesn't even realize she's an android.  He's understandably shocked when she tells him she's leaving, and it's a testament to his craftsmanship that he created her so perfectly that she has enough emotions to actually leave him.  Hyzy captures the characters perfectly, especially during a poignant scene where Noonian has deactivated her to examine what's happening, and carries on the conversation with her that he knows he would have if she were currently activated.  It's a touching story, compelling despite the fact that it doesn't have any of the regular Trek characters in it.  Definitely worthy of the grand prize.<br /><br />The second prize entry is \\"Guardians,\\" by Brett Hudgins, one of the \\"Speculations\\" stories.  This story travels a *long* way into the future.  It's about the Horta and how they've interacted with the Federation throughout the 50,000 year lifetime of the mother Horta.  Eventually, humans leave the Horta home planet of Janus VI, and leave them alone (though the former head of the mining colony there does make regular visits to his new Horta friends).  However, when a scientific station on the planet containing the Guardian of Forever (an ancient time portal discovered by Kirk & the Enterprise) is wiped out, an ancestor of the original mining colony head remembers the Horta and thinks that they would make great protectors of the guardian.  The rest of the story is various vignettes through almost 50,000 years, as various races come to the Guardian planet.  Some to try and conquer it (like the Borg) and some to just look at the past (like a certain founder who is remembering his past Bajoran lover many, many years in the future).  At times, this story seems to gloss over events a little too quickly, but all of the vignettes are good in their own way.  Some are just little snippets (such as a couple of visits by Q, complaining about how humanity is suddenly becoming equal to the Q as they move on to the next level) and others are a bit more detailed.  I did have a little trouble with some of the future history (the Federation is still around, virtually unchanged politically and socially, thousandsof years in the future, though they have obviously improved technologically), but overall, the story was quite good.<br /><br />Finally, the third prize winner is \\"Adventures in Jazz & Time,\\" by Kelly Cairo.  This is the story of a gift that Wesley (still a futuristic Traveller, and disguised as a Federation professor) decides that he wants to give something back to one of his role models, Commander Riker.  He gives him a truly interactive jazz holoprogram containing the jazz great Stan Kenton.  Even better for Riker, Kenton asks him to sit in with him and is willing to give him some lessons.  This is a dream come true for Riker, who has idolized Kenton for a long time.  Cairo captures Riker's love of jazz wonderfully, and the story, while pretty short, covers all the bases.  Wesley leads Riker to the program and then dutifully bows out of the picture.  While I don't know anything about Kenton, she manages to capture the feel of a jazz great as well.  There's no conflict in this story.  Just a young man wanting to do something nice for one of his mentors, and the love of jazz.  Just poetic.<br /><br />The rest of the stories in the volume are hit or miss.  Some have some glaring errors (one has Seven of Nine, from Voyager, speaking with a lot of exclamation points, something the rather monotone Borg woman wouldn't do).  Others are decent but don't carry that spark that carries them over the top.  Still, it's an interesting read, and a number of the current Trek authors got their starts in Strange New Worlds collections, so it may be something to pay attention to if only for that.

US	50332419	RO4PD87C184ZZ	0060531126	964752527	1812: The War That Forged a Nation	Books	4	85	87	N	N	A national identity is formed	1812: The War That Forged A Nation, by Walter R. Borneman, is a comprehensive, if somewhat superficial, look at the war that gave the United States a national identity, even as it ended in essentially a stalemate.  Borneman is mostly known for history books dealing with the western United States, and he even mentions in his Acknowledgements how this book seems to be out of his field.  However, Borneman maintains that the war set the United States on a course that would result in the western expansion that is his bread and butter, and thus deserves to be looked at more closely.  It's a very interesting book that covers the entire war that tells everything that happened, though it doesn't quite go into as much detail as I would have liked.<br /><br />Borneman sets the stage for the war by discussing the relations between Great Britain and the United States in the first decade of the 1800s, including one of the main reasons for the United States to go to war:  the impressments of American sailors into British naval service on the high seas.  The United States was still considered an extremely minor power and was bullied by pretty much everybody.  While the French didn't impress sailors, they did do other things, and some hawks in the American government actually advocated going to war with both Britain and France!  One other reason for the war, not as popularly known, was that many westerners wanted to steal Canada out from under Great Britain while they were distracted by Napoleon on the continent.  They didn't see any reason why Canada shouldn't be part of the United States, by force if necessary.<br /><br />Thus, the war drums were beaten, and war was declared.  Borneman does a great job showing us all of the machinations that went on behind the scenes to get the declaration of war passed in Congress, along with a couple of incidents that almost got the war started before it really did.  While this information is obviously well-known to history buffs who have studied the era, it was information that I hadn't known before and I liked how Borneman laid it all out for us.  He shows how Madison went along with all of this, though he was almost hoping that Congress would bail him out of the course he had set for the country.<br /><br />Once the fighting starts, Borneman also explains all the battles that happened during the war, sometimes in very vivid detail.  He tells us about the horribly executed three-pronged invasion of Canada that resulted in the loss of Detroit to the British, as well as the first major US victories on the high seas before the British finally started taking this upstart navy seriously.  The level of detail is amazing sometimes, though for some reason I felt a bit removed from all of the action.  I'm not sure if it's because he is sometimes unable to give reasons for what happened or if it's his style, but while the prose is detailed, I felt like something was missing.  Perhaps it's because the book comes in two modes:  detailed battle information and the reasons behind some of the events in the war, but these two modes never really mingle.  Instead, we get some battle detail, then we get some \\"big picture\\" information, and then we go back to the battles, etc.<br /><br />I do have to give Borneman credit, however, for making a (for lack of a better word) \\"boring\\" war very interesting to read about.  He has obviously done his research and he gives descriptions of tactics in each battle (including wonderfully rendered maps!).  These descriptions make you feel like you are right there on the battlefield, hearing the explosions and feeling musket balls whistle past your ear.  Sometimes his descriptions make it seem impossible that so few (relatively speaking, of course) men actually died in these battles.  He describes men being mown down by rows of musket fire and then we hear casualties of 81 killed and 500 wounded or the like.  Of note is his account of the Battle of New Orleans, a battle that was fought after the armistice had been signed but before news had reached the participants, and could have resulted in a resumption of hostilities if the British had won.  This battle is even more lovingly described than the rest of them and he really shows Andrew Jackson's leadership and tactical expertise in this chapter.<br /><br />The War of 1812 was a war that some in the United States wanted for their own purposes, but one that almost to a man it was desperate to get out of as Napoleon surrenders and the British are able to concentrate on this annoying gnat of a country.  Nothing was resolved officially, but it turns out to be the war that would cement the feeling of \\"America\\" on an infant country that was just trying to find its feet in the world.  Borneman does a great job showing how this occurred, with Jackson's resounding victory of a battle-hardened British army being the final piece of the puzzle.  While there may be more comprehensive books on the War of 1812 out there, 1812: The War that Forged a Nation is a wonderful starting point.<br /><br />David Royght after the armistice had been signed but before news had reached the participants, and could have resulted in a resumption of hostilities if the British had won.

US	50332419	RIWYUBL3WJLTL	1892389754	817090532	Mother Aegypt and Other Stories	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Kage Baker does it again!	As most of you who read my reviews know, Kage Baker is my favourite writer out there.  She has written numerous short stories that are scattered hither and yon, almost impossible to keep up with.  Thankfully, she has a habit of collecting her stories in compilations.  Best known for her series of books about \\"The Company,\\" Mother Aegypt and Other Stories is unusual in that it doesn't contain any Company stories.  Instead, it draws together a bunch of her other fiction, mostly fantasy.  It contains two stories about Lord Ermenwyr, from The Anvil of the World, as well as other fantastic stuff.  I have to say that, after finding this book, I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I had read two of the stories already, which had drawn me to her in the first place, and this just made me want more of her stuff.  As is usual with collections, there is the occasional clunker, but the overall quality is quite high.  Strangely, most of the weak stories seem to be ones she wrote for sale on Fictionwise.com, which makes me wonder.  They almost seem like they were churned out so that they would have some stories to sell.  I'm not saying that's what happened, but it certainly feels like it.  Thankfully, the final Fictionwise story is outstanding, redeeming the rest of them.<br /><br />Probably the two best stories are \\"What the Tyger Told Her\\" and \\"Desolation Rose\\".  While all the stories (even the weaker ones) have that wonderful Baker prose and characterization, these two just stand out.  The Tyger in \\"What the Tyger Told Her\\" coaches a young girl into seeing what lurks beneath the surface of her high-society family, and what greed can do to you.  It also touches on the role of women in a male-dominated world, as the child is effectively invisible because of her two brothers.  \\"Desolation Rose\\" is a redemption story for Lord Ermenwyr as he finds that sometimes romance isn't the end-all and be-all.  He ends up doing the right thing, though true to his personality he doesn't quite go all the way.<br /><br />Probably the weakest of the stories is \\"How They Tried to Talk Indian Tony Down.\\"  I just found the characters uninteresting and the story was too slight.  Thankfully, it was very short and thus didn't take that much time.  If it had been longer, I may have done the unthinkable and actually skipped it.  Other weak stories are \\"The Summer People\\" and \\"Miss Yahoo Has Her Say,\\" both of which I didn't really care about.  \\"Miss Yahoo Has Her Say\\" also forces the reader to get through a form of pidgin English which was annoying until I got used to it.  Even the only original story in this collection, \\"Mother Aegypt,\\" suffered from a weak ending, though the rest of the story was fabulous.<br /><br />Overall, though, the collection is wonderful.  If you're a Kage Baker fan, you have to pick this up.  If you want to see what the fuss is all about but don't want to get involved in The Company just yet, this is a good taste of the quality writer that is Kage Baker.<br /><br />Dave Royuite go all the way. <br /> <br />Probably the weakest of the stories is \\"How They Tried to Talk Indian Tony Down.\\"  I just found the characters uninteresting and the story was too slight.

US	50332419	R100L848W3F1OB	0765309874	844711788	Treason Keep: Book Two of the Hythrun Chronicles	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A riveting mixture of religion and politics in a fantasy set	Jennifer Fallon has become, to me, one of the premiere fantasy authors out there.  Her plots are always intricate, involving a mixture of politics and religion that is simply breath-taking.  Lots of interesting events happen, characters are betrayed, things go against them in unexpected ways, and the same characters solve their problems in somewhat unpredictable fashion.  In this second book of the Hythrun Chronicles, Treason Keep, Fallon continues her winning technique.  The sequel to Medalon, Treason Keep ratchets up the tension, adds some new characters, transforms one, and keeps the reader riveted in the process.  Her second book (published in Australia) shows a lot of improvement over Medalon, and that one was so good anyway that I was salivating for this one.<br /><br />\\"Unexpected\\" is the word to use for a lot of the events in Treason Keep.  Sure, there are some predictable occurrences.  Whoever doesn't see one of the budding romances in the book is completely blind, but even the predictable parts come from the characters rather than being imposed by authorial fiat.  Given the personalities of the two characters involved in said romance, and the circumstances of them coming together, it's very understandable how that happens.  Also, some happenings are predictable, but the manner in which they happen takes you by surprise.  The failure of a plan that would end the entire series if it worked is not surprising, but as the events unfurled I found myself gasping in shock, though looking at the lead-up to them and saying \\"so that's where she was going with that!\\"  In fact, many of the chapters end in jaw-dropping moments which made the book very hard to put down.<br /><br />Fallon's mastery of her characters is even better in Treason Keep than in Medalon.  In the previous book, I said that Fallon's only weakness was the evil character, Joyhinia (R'Shiel's mother).  This time, she doesn't even have that problem, though she comes close.  While she does a wonderful job with the religious fanatic, Cratyn, who marries the princess of Fardohnya, he is not the most three-dimensional character.  He is interesting to read about, though.  Perhaps that is because we only see him through others' eyes and not his own.  On the other hand, Loclon suffers a little bit from his single-minded need for revenge against R'Shiel.  The interest in his character is saved mainly because he gets into a situation that is supposed to help him get his revenge but instead makes him a pawn in a religious and political game that he wants no part of.  His thought processes are one-dimensional, but what happens to him grabs the reader and makes him more interesting than perhaps he deserves.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are wonderful, though, especially Mikel.  Mikel is a fervent believer in Xaphista who becomes thoroughly confused as he witnesses the adult events swirling by around him.  He thinks Adrina is the perfect Karien woman, devout and knowing her place as a woman, until he sees the real Adrina.  But then he sees the real Karien and realizes that it may not be the place for him.  All of the interactions between these characters are intricate and build layer upon layer into the story.  Even the minor characters are relatively three-dimensional, though Hablet, the king of Fardohnya, is a little stereotypically devious.  Thankfully, he's only in the book briefly.<br /><br />There were really only a couple of faults in the book (and the series), though one of them may be resolved in the next book, Harshini.  The first is that I'm a bit bothered by the fact that R'Shiel and Tarja's romance was imposed on them.  Fallon treats it like any other romance, with them mating like rabbits when they're together (though thankfully there isn't a lot of that, and no graphic scenes), but the fact that it's against their will (or at least, much more than either one had planned) is disturbing.  If Fallon has it revealed in the next book and there are some consequences, then I will be very happy.<br /><br />The second problem is there is a battle (more like a massacre) that seems to be in there for no real reason.

After reading Old Wounds, I was left to wonder whether a book series could get any worse.  I was almost dreading picking up the second book, Enemy of my Enemy, but since I had already bought it, there didn't seem to be much reason not to.  Whatever its problems were, Old Wounds was a quick read, so this one promised to at least be the same (despite being 30 pages longer).  I am happy to say that it is a lot better than the first book.  I am unhappy to say that the reason for this is because the first one is so bad, not because this one is that good.  Enemy of my Enemy doesn't have near the number of howlers as Old Wounds did, but that's mainly because it's using the same story and characters and thus we are used to them.<br /><br />Enemy of my Enemy contains many of the same problems as Old Wounds, but they aren't as prominent, mainly because there is actually some action and intrigue in this book.  The cat and mouse game between \\"Chakotay\\" and the doctor got interesting at times, even if some of the scenes were just laughable (especially the scene where Kaz sneaks into Kim's quarters to wake him up.  What, the door buzzer doesn't work?).  While I didn't buy how long it took for everybody to figure out that something was wrong with Chakotay (as spiritual a man as Chakotay is leaving behind the body of his sister when it would be very easy to retrieve her?  That's not the Chakotay I, or most of the others, know), I was able to put that aside and let some of the individual scenes wash over me.  Granted, there weren't many of them, but there were a couple.  The problem with this plot is that it's not even remotely believable.  Not retrieving Sekaya's body is one of the main points.  Sure, it makes everybody think that something's wrong, but nobody seems to realize that Chakotay's grief in no way explains it like they seem to think it does.  It drags out the plot a lot longer than it should have (but then it'd be a pretty short book, wouldn't it?)<br /><br />Golden's \\"romance novel\\" language is slightly toned down in this one, or at least I didn't notice it as much.  There is one \\"heaving [...]\\" reference which I had to laugh at, but overall it's not too bad.  The prose itself is fairly wooden, but at least I didn't feel like putting my finger down my throat.  She has an annoying turn of phrase at times.  One time, referring to Kaz and Kim, she actually says \\"The two Voyagers exchanged glances.\\"  Excuse me?  Ugh.  Golden also continues to have problems keeping continuity within her own books.  In Old Wounds, Kaz's previous host's personality keeps coming to the forefront of his mind because his isoboromine levels were too low.  Then, on page 97 of this book, he claims that his problems were caused by \\"elevated\\" isoboromine levels.  Which is it?<br /><br />Golden gets most of the other characters right (or at least close), but one character continues to stick out as being horribly designed.  That is Astall, the Huanni ship's counselor, who continues to be written as overly emotional and, thus, unrealistic as a counselor.  \\"Her huge purple eyes searched his, and tears welled in them.  She blinked them back, striving to maintain her professional demeanor despite her almost overwhelming emotions.\\"  This is a counselor?<br /><br />One of my earlier complaints was that the scenes with the holographic doctor and Seven of Nine didn't appear to have anything to do with the story.  I still believe that, but at least their few scenes in this book actually did have a little relevance.  The same can't be said for Torres' scenes.  Torres is on the Klingon monastery world of Boreth, and she begins delving into the prophecies that may involve her daughter.  This storyline is clearly intended for subsequent books and just feels shoehorned into this one, bringing what little tension there is in the main plot to a screeching halt.  The Deep Space Nine relaunch series does have a lot of continuing plotlines that carry from book to book, but at leastall of the characters are interacting within those plots.  The O'Briens had gone back to Earth, and they weren't featured in any of the books until they returned to the station.  Torres is so far removed from this story that she seems completely out of place in it.<br /><br />All in all, Enemy of my Enemy is a marginally better book than Old Wounds.  Some of the scenes are more interesting, the writing foibles are toned down slightly, and it didn't irritate me nearly as much.  Consider it a mild sunburn to the poison oak of Old Wounds.  I'm still not going to try any more of these Voyager relaunch books unless they get good reviews from people who are known to have hated these two.<br /><br />David Roycting within those plots.

With Unity ending the most recent Deep Space Nine storyline and sending many of the characters off in different directions, the editors have decided to devote three books to stories about various planets involved in the overall story.  Call Worlds of Deep Space Nine, each book will have two stories.  The first one, dealing with Cardassia and Andor, is a hit or miss affair, depending on which story you're talking about.  It consists of a Cardassian story, \\"The Lotus Flower\\" (by Una McCormack) and an Andorian story, \\"Paradigm\\" (by Heather Jarman).  Overall, the book is well worth reading, with even the weaker story having its moments.<br /><br />\\"The Lotus Flower\\" begins the book with a very strong story.  McCormack, who currently has only a Deep Space Nine short story to her name, proves to be very adept at capturing the O'Briens and their interesting marriage.  O'Brien is a tinkerer, and one of the best scenes in the story is when he's attempting to fix the air conditioning when he should be preparing his presentation to the Cardassian council.  The exasperation and the affection that Keiko has are perfectly done.  The story itself is kind of pedestrian, but it does highlight Keiko's ability to lead and be strong, something that wasn't really emphasized in the television series very often (though that may be from Rosalind Chao's performance than anything else).  O'Brien's feelings of helplessness when he sees the takeover of the auditorium is also well done.  It's even a little forgivable that, given all of the concentration on O'Brien and Macet, that they don't have much to do with the resolution.  Everything ties together quite beautifully.<br /><br />Garak, as usual, stands out in this one, though.  He has some great lines, especially when having lunch with O'Brien.  He's cognizant of what Cardassia has become, he loves the planet and the people but he knows that the old Cardassia is dead and that a new one must be reborn.  He fully supports Ghemor, but you get the feeling that it's more because he's the best of a bad lot than because he thinks Ghemor can get the job done.  He is devious and recognizes that deviousness in others as well.  In essence, he's the tailor/spy that we all know and love, with the exception of a line or two here or there that didn't ring quite true.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a story about the new Cardassia, and how many problems will continue to spring up as its people attempt to bring it back to prominence in the Alpha Quadrant.  It's a story of patriots who realize that a new Cardassia must be born, and ultra-conservatives who feel that the Cardassian way of life will disappear as it's more and more heavily influenced by Federation and Bajoran values.  It's this constant war between the two sides of Cardassia that keep this story interesting, and seeing how our familiar characters (Garak and the O'Briens) react to it that will insist on dragging me along with them.  This is a first class story.<br /><br />I wish I could say the same about \\"Paradigm,\\" but I can't.  I have criticized Jarman's work before, but this time it may not be completely her problem.  While \\"The Lotus Flower\\" was a story about the new Cardassia, we already know a lot about its society, so it didn't have to set up a lot.  \\"Paradigm\\" must give us a lot of information about Andor, and thus it becomes way too much of a travelogue rather than a story.  We hear a great deal about all aspects of Andor society, almost too much.  Pages go by as Prynn and Shar walk the streets of Andor, absorbing all the sights and sounds and causing the story itself to retreat to the background for a little while.  I have made no secret about how the Andorian aspects of the Deep Space Nine books have been the least interesting to me for the most part, though there have been some good uses of it.  Thus, spending this much time just getting to know the society felt really useless to me.  Perhaps you will feel differently if you enjoyed these aspectsof the previous novels.<br /><br />Thus, the first half of the story (it's 200 pages long, with small type as mentioned above) just drags to a halt many times.  When the Fodor's Guide aspect to the story isn't intruding, it's the developing relationship between Prynn and Shar getting in the way.  This was the least interesting and believable part of Unity, a fault that I didn't mention because the rest of the book was so good.  To see it highlighted here just made me cringe a little bit more.  Jarman handles them as well as she is able, but she was unable to get past my dislike of this coupling, at least at the beginning.<br /><br />Once the kidnapping occurs, however, things really begin to take off.  What this ultimately means to Andorian society grabbed me like nothing else Andorian has before.  It also helps that things actually start happening, but even the philosophical parts of the book have a bit more bite.  The arguments between Prynn, Shar, and another Andorian female who wants Andor to remain the way it has been, are riveting and it's almost a shame (though completely understandable) when Phillipa commands them to stop and continue on with their mission.  Shar's ultimate decision about his place in Andorian society is agonizing, and poor Prynn is caught in the middle.  In the last part of the story, Jarman's characterization of all the regulars is great.<br /><br />So the first Worlds of Deep Space Nine book gives us a great story and a so-so story.  Not bad, though not up to the level of the other Deep Space Nine books.  Let's hope the other two books are better, but this one is definitely worth checking out, even more so if you actually like the Andorians.<br /><br />David Royse aspects of the previous novels.   <br /> <br />Thus, the first half of the story (it's 200 pages long, with small type as mentioned above) just drags to a halt many times.

US	50332419	R2OX40WVEOOSP2	0743492587	118186550	Spirit Walk, Book One: Old Wounds (Star Trek Voyager (Paperback Unnumbered)) (Bk. 1)	Books	1	3	5	N	N	Oh, this does not bode well...	With the train wreck that was The Farther Shore, one had to wonder about the continuation of the Star Trek: Voyager series.  With Spirit Walk: Old Wounds, would Christie Golden be able to recover from it, or would she continue to wallow in overly emotional characterization and romance novel elements that permeated that book (and, to a lesser and more tolerable extent, Homecoming)?  Golden is finally able to create her own characters and take the familiar Voyager characters into uncharted waters.  Unfortunately, she falls more into the latter category than the former, and the book really suffers for it.<br /><br />I have four words for you:  Harry Kim, Security Chief.  With this jaw-dropping development, a lot of the believability of the novel just flies out the window.  Why Chakotay would choose Kim to be his security chief when Kim has not only not shown any desire to be in security before, but he has a truly appalling naivet&eacute; even up toward the end of the series.  This is not a man I would want taking charge of security.  He certainly deserves a promotion, but a new position as well?  What makes matters worse is that Kim is the only recognizable face that Chakotay takes with him on Voyager (the only other main character who served on the ship during the series is Lyssa Campbell, but she's also a creation from one of Golden's previous books and never actually appeared on television).  Thus, we are given a brand new crew for the most part, forcing us to trust in Golden's characterization skills to get to know the new people.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that doesn't go over too well.  Kaz, the medical officer, is from the previous two books and gets a bit more development here.  However, he treads old ground like it was new, as he's a Trill that wasn't meant to be joined with a symbiont but had to because there was no other host available.  We've seen this before in Ezri Dax, and only the circumstances have changed.  He's not a bland character, but the constant references to Grandak, his symbiont's previous host, started getting annoying.  He enlists the help of the new ship's counselor in dealing with the problem of the previous host coming to the forefront.<br /><br />Which brings me to Astall.  She is a Huanni, a race introduced in Golden's The Last Outpost.  The Huanni are overly emotional beings who have been absorbed into the Federation and have made wonderful counselors.  What Astall makes, however, is a really annoying character.  Her emotions are all over the place, and she shows little of the competence that I complimented Golden on in The Last Outpost.  Instead, Astall's emotions take over.  She's very affectionate to everybody, giving hugs in inappropriate places and tearing up at odd times for no apparent reason.  She got on my nerves in almost every scene she was in.<br /><br />The rest of the introduced characters are rather bland, though there is an indication that one of them will not be so bland in the future.  The problem with this is that we now get into another bad aspect of this book, which is the overly emotional writing.  The character in question, Lieutenant Tare, suffered a personal assault when she was a prisoner of vicious holograms in The Farther Shore, and it's deeply affecting her.  Not much is done with it in Old Wounds, but I foresee a very melodramatic subplot at some point coming up.  I don't really see why this would be such a stigma in the Trek universe that we've been presented with, but for some reason she's keeping it a secret from as many people as possible.  In our time?  Sure.  But not in the 24th century.<br /><br />In addition to romance novel subplots, we have our share of romance novel plotting and writing as well.  The Libby Webber storyline just has to go.  It's completely unrealistic, and her relationship with Harry is also grates on the nerves, as we get the standard \\"oh, I can't marry you because I have a secret that I must keep from you\\" plot.  Give me a break. She is not a believable Starfleet Intelligence agent and I roll my eyes every time she's \\"on screen.\\"  As for the writing, here's an example:<br /><br />\\"She closed her eyes and leaned forward, giving the honor of her first kiss to this sweet boy she had loved all her life, who pressed his lips to hers with at first a kind of hesitant awe, then with increasing passion, not dreamy and distant from her, not any more...\\" pg 208-209<br /><br />I believe \\"trite\\" is the right word for it.<br /><br />Finally, there is the attempt to shoehorn every Voyager character into the story, despite the fact that the story has nothing to do with them.  The Doctor and Seven of Nine have a few scenes together that do not further the plot at all and don't even further much of their own story either.  There's no reason for these scenes to be in there other than to pad out an already sparse book.  Large typeface and a short book make for a story that *really* should have been combined into one book.<br /><br />There's not enough space to go into everything else that's wrong with this book, but there is lots.  I already have the second book, so I'll be finishing the series, but unless it's a major step up, this will be the last.  I do like these characters, despite the weaknesses of the television show, but this novel series is doing them a disservice.  It's predictable (anybody who can't guess one of the major villains of the story is not paying attention) and it's poorly written.

US	50332419	R3JR1Z0MP404KA	074349654X	244865575	Unity (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Now *this* is an ending!	With Unity, by S.D. Perry, the first section of the continuation of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is concluded.  It's a nine-month arc that carries through the pregnancy of Ben Sisko's wife, Kasidy, and how the station has functioned since Ben was taken away by the Prophets to exist outside of \\"linear time.\\"  Perry started the whole shebang with Avatar, so it's only fitting that she be allowed to end it as well.  Unity is an explosive conclusion that ends a few plotlines, continues a few others, and sets the table for any future books to come.  It has to deal with the Ben Sisko situation, bring back a lot of other Deep Space Nine characters, and also tell an exciting story.  Can any one book do all of that?  Thankfully, yes.  Perry hits one out of the park with Unity, creating a book that I literally could not put down (I had to force myself a couple of times, but that was it).<br /><br />Perry throws everything except the proverbial kitchen sink in there, yet the story doesn't feel overstuffed.  Every Deep Space Nine character is seen in some capacity, no matter how briefly.  The threat to the Federation is handled extremely well, with the tension so thick you could cut it with a phaser.  Perry brings it all together with aplomb, never feeling rushed and allowing the characters to reflect a little bit on what's been going on.  Many of the ongoing storylines are resolved (Vaughn's and Kira's especially, but also the \\"should I stay or should I go\\" routine from both Ro and Quark) and others get new directions (such as the O'Briens, who have come to the station with Joseph Sisko for the birth of Kas' child).  The direction that O'Brien's story takes is actually very interesting, and is leading to a good story in the first Worlds of Deep Space Nine book, so that's good news.  It's also good to see everybody again, seeing how they interact and fall into the relationships that had been put on hold when they went their separate ways.  Perry does this and still gives us a story filled with action and adventure.<br /><br />Perry does still give us a little humour, though.  One scene involving the threat and its interaction with Taran'atar (the Jem'Hadar character, who is one of the few to get short shrift) is very abrupt but hilarious, adding a little levity to the whole proceedings.  Overall, though, the mood is dark and Perry allows you to feel every bit as nervous as the characters feel.  She's so vivid in her descriptions that she even makes you feel Kas' labour pains.  Now *that's* effective!  Perry has a beautiful style that keeps you involved with the characters, wanting to go just that little bit farther.  Especially effective are the scenes in the asylum with \\"Eli\\" and Benny, as Vaughn wallows in his guilt and Benny tries to help him.  I have complained about the excess angst in the Mission: Gamma books, but here the angst is used for a purpose that I found interesting, and thus it didn't become as annoying as it did in those books.  This angst is the very problem Vaughn has to deal with, and it illuminates not only Benny's character as he helps, but also Opaka's character before the asylum sequence.  The scenes between Opaka and Vaughn are wonderfully written, with lines such as:<br /><br />\\"Of course,\\" she replied, recognizing his need for control, or what he believed that to be.  It was unfortunate that he struggled so.  Over time, she'd come to believe that the only true emotional infirmity was denial; once a thing was accepted, it could be met without fear.  She wished she could tell him that it was no weakness, whatever he was fighting against, though she suspected that he would perceive her comment as intrusive.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, a couple of characters are sidelined to make room for all of this.  I already mentioned Taran'atar, but the other one is Dr. Bashir.  He does a few things and he has a few lines, but he doesn't really impact the reader at all. His main function is to do research on the problem at hand andto be concerned for Ezri.  This doesn't make him a very interesting character, but he has had a lot of time in the spotlight recently, so I guess it's justifiable.  Any other flaws in the book are extremely minor and steamrolled by the quality of the rest of the book.  At the end, they're flattened to irrelevance by this steamroller of a story, and I have to say that I enjoyed this book very much.  The ending is simply wonderful, especially the scene in Kira's office which brings the entire series full circle, with Kira repeating a line that she used in the opening story, Emissary, to great effect.  The whole sequence is touching and this story is effectively over.  Nevertheless, there is much groundwork for future stories to begin, and while some of the placesetting is a little awkward and trite (especially Quark's ending), the rest of it makes me desperately wish for more stories to come soon.  That's the sign of a good conclusion, and just reinforces why Deep Space Nine is my favourite Trek.<br /><br />David Royhand and to be concerned for Ezri.

US	50332419	R3MR4TYVZKMGI	0713992069	925148876	The Holy Grail - Imagination And Belief	Books	5	18	20	N	N	A journey through the ages of Grail literature	The Holy Grail, the Cup of Christ, it's been called many names.  The Grail has been the stuff of legends for centuries.  Almost always associated in some way with King Arthur, the Grail has made its way through time to the modern day through stories, epic poems, and other forms of media.  Where did it come from?  Was there some original legend that this was all based on?  Or was it all a figment of some writer's imagination that caught fire and lasted throughout the ages?  Richard Barber's new book, The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief, sets out to answer some of these questions.  Unlike some books, Barber does not try to prove the Grail is real, or where it can be found.  Instead, Barber's intent is to examine the legend of the Grail, to trace its history through all of the Arthurian romances of the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries, all the way up to the modern day.  When a book like this mentions both Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, you know it's complete!<br /><br />Barber begins at the beginning, probably the best place to start.  The first Arthurian tale about the Grail is thought to have been written by Chretien de Troyes, a French writer probably from the town of the same name.  Chretien was a writer of medieval romances, and he called this particular selection \\"The Story of the Grail.\\"  There is no indication that he was adapting any other story, either verbal or long-lost written, so it is widely believed that he invented the thing.  Unfortunately, he did not live to finish the story, and a number of men tried to continue it.  Barber examines the original in great detail, reprinting a great many passages from it.  He quotes it for four pages and then says:<br /><br />\\"I have quoted this at length, because it is the original of all subsequent descriptions of the Grail and its surroundings, and we shall see how the least detail becomes critical to our investigation.\\"  Pg 19<br /><br />He does this with many of the tracts that he analyzes, from the continuations of Chretien's poem after he died, to Robert de Boron, and numerous others.  Then he expertly analyzes the text to demonstrate just what part of the legend has changed or has been reused by each subsequent author.  He goes into great detail about all of the variations of the Grail story that appeared in the late 12th century to around 1240.  It's fascinating watching the history of the Grail, one of the most intriguing objects in literature, virtually change before your eyes as you get a different author's imagination applied to it.  These first few chapters seem kind of long at first, with great blocks of text, much of it in smaller font because it's a quote.  However, I quickly lost myself in these stories and Barber's dissection of them.  It's very important to establish this base for when he moves on to the later centuries.<br /><br />In these early tales, the Grail was variously representative of either the Eucharist or other specific rituals from the Christian mythos.  Each story always contained some sort of procession of young virgins carrying the Grail through the castle of the Keeper of the Grail as Percival or Galahad looked on.  There was always some kind of religious meaning to the whole story.  As the Church clamped down on heretical ideas in literature and other writing, the Grail stories died off, but were quickly unearthed when things lightened up a little bit in the 16th century and beyond, during the Enlightenment.  Since that time, other variations of the Grail story have been told, usually leaving out some part of it or adapting it to current political times.  Barber points out that, as time has gone on, the story of the Grail has become more secularized, making commentary on either society or on current politics.  He ends the book with a discussion of the Grail in modern times, where it has lost virtually all of its religious significance, instead becoming defined as the unreachable goal, such as a Unified Theory being \\"the holy grail of science.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book, Barber has undoubtedly left out some stories, but it's hard to imagine how little they must have to do with the Grail to deserve being left out.  His research is very thorough and his commentary on each piece is fascinating to read.  He's not afraid to call something nonsense when it clearly is, especially the attempts to tie the Grail into occult practices in the late 1800s.  He viciously tears apart Holy Blood, Holy Grail, calling it not real history, but a \\"conspiracy theory of history.\\"  He even examines the Grail as portrayed in movies, with an especially adept analysis of The Fisher King with Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges.  As more evidence of its completeness, there are over 300 endnotes (a lot of them for quotes from the various stories) and the bibliography contains close to 600 books and stories.  If you have any interest in the Grail or medieval history, this book holds your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief is about exactly that:  the contrast between the imagining of the Grail, all those years ago, to the belief in the ideal of the Grail.  Barber never goes down the path of \\"is the Grail real?\\"  Instead, he tells us about how the idea of the Grail has affected western literature and, at times, history throughout the ages.  From religious icon to chivalric symbol to secular goal, the Grail has stayed with us since its beginning, buried at times, but never truly forgotten.  It's been the spark of some very imaginative stories and some strange conspiracy theories.  This book takes you all along that winding path, on a journey of discovery that won't let you go.<br /><br />David Roya Unified Theory being \\"the holy grail of science.\\"   <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Barber has undoubtedly left out some stories, but it's hard to imagine how little they must have to do with the Grail to deserve being left out.

A Time to Harvest, the sequel to A Time to Sow, has most of the same strengths and weaknesses that the first one had.  Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore do give us a rousing conclusion to the story, but they wallow even more in continuity and explanations, dragging the narrative to a halt way too often.  Add a bit of angst (but not as much as the first book), and you've got a slow-moving plodder that can get quite interesting at times.<br /><br />The Enterprise, having discovered survivors of the planet Dokaal's destruction, has been helping them deal with both internal and external strife.  The Dokaalan are trying to make another planet in their system habitable for them, but it's not easy.  Internal dissent and terrorist attacks have been preventing progress in the whole endeavour.  Captain Picard has offered the Enterprise's expertise in the field and the Dokaalan have reluctantly accepted it, as long as there is no actual material help.  But the program may be able to get any further as an outside force has its own agenda for the Dokaalans, one that doesn't have their well-being in mind.  Once this is discovered, Picard and crew have an even tougher task on their hands as the external threat proves to be more ruthless than even Picard had realized.  Old friends have come to visit, and they want to stay!<br /><br />This review could almost be a carbon copy of A Time to Sow, as it has many of the same problems.  The characters don't brood as much, though there is another horrible terrorist attack that gives Riker the opportunity to wallow in guilt over not having been able to do anything.  He doesn't do it to the extent Picard did in the first book, though.  He does move on, which is a good thing.  No, the main problem with A Time to Harvest is once again the heavy continuity and the desire to explain every little bit of every reference.  When the aliens are finally revealed for what they are (and there's really no clue unless you know every episode by heart, and then you may still not have guessed!), Dilmore and Ward spend two whole pages explaining what happened in the episode.  Two pages!  Talk about grinding a book to a halt.<br /><br />In addition to the continuity drag on the book, Ward and Dilmore take great pains to explain what happened in the first book.  And when I say great, I mean *mammoth* proportions.  No, a \\"previously on Star Trek...\\" forward to the book would not do.  Instead, every time an event from A Time to Sow is mentioned, it has to be thoroughly explained.  Sometimes it takes more than two paragraphs.  Once again, an interesting plot with cool aliens and some pretty decent action is marred by the molasses of overwriting.  I understand that you need to allow for the reader who picks this book up without the first one, but I think they could have done this much better.  A foreward would have been the way to go in this case.<br /><br />Ward and Dilmore do some things right, however.  Once again, they've nailed the regulars (when they're not getting overly introspective, anyway).  Picard shows a sharp intelligence as he outwits his opponents.  He shows his compassion as he does everything he can to help the Dokaalans and is willing to let them do as much as they wish to do by themselves.  The horror when one of their experiments goes horribly wrong is quite effectively done, though the experiment backfiring is somewhat predictable even without knowing what the aliens' plot is.  I didn't mention this in the first review, but the authors do add a few interesting characters in their own right.  Especially fun is the Denobulan doctor, Tropp.  He's similar enough to Phlox in the television show Enterprise (the best character on the show) to be familiar, but he has his own personality and he's quite a hoot.  They also do a good job with the \\"new\\" old guard, like Lt. Vale and Perim, the new navigator.  These are characters introduced for this series, but this is the fourth book they've been in.<br /><br />Another strength in the novel is we get a lot of scenes from the aliens' point of view.  This is probably more effective because we have no idea who they are, so they're not recognizable.  The scenes of them infiltrating the Enterprise are quite well done, though they do get overwritten a bit.  One of them spends a great deal of time thinking about the past and their plan and what he needs to do and how maybe the humans aren't as stupid as they look and boy to they smell and...well, you get the picture.  For the most part, though, they are very effective and it actually adds to the tension as you see that their plan just might succeed.<br /><br />It all comes down to a very tense sequence at the end that's all action and plotting and counter-plotting, giving us a break from all of the internal monologues.  Picard comes up with a great plan and the bad guys aren't defeated because they're stupid.  I like intelligent villains, and these guys are.  When Ward and Dilmore decide to get the book moving, they can really do it!  It makes me wonder why they can't soften their slow tendencies throughout the rest of the book.  Sure, the book can't be all action, but a happy medium would definitely be nice.<br /><br />A Time to Harvest is a step up from the last book, but just barely.  While A Time to Sow is a low three-star book, this is definitely a high one.  Hopefully, this trend can continue.<br /><br />David Roy>Another strength in the novel is we get a lot of scenes from the aliens' point of view.

US	50332419	ROD63ZG2CB1KI	0743482999	488519076	A Star Trek: The Next Generation: Time #3: A Time to Sow	Books	3	4	4	N	N	You won't find a good story in your navel	With the first two books in the Time to... series out of the way, would two different authors be able to turn things around?  In a way they do, but there is one major strike against it.<br /><br />Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise are still dealing with the political fallout from the last two books, and are sent on a mission to get them out of the way for a while.  It's a bit of a milkrun, really.  Many years ago, a probe dispatched from a distant area of the galaxy was found, but Starfleet, still in its infancy, didn't have the time or resources to do anything about it.  Now, another probe has been found.  Both probes speak of a civilization on a dying planet, and it was figured that getting there would take too long to rescue any survivors (since the probe took years to get to where the Vulcans found it to begin with).  The Enterprise is sent to investigate what happened and see if they can find out what happened all those years ago.  When they get there, they discover an asteroid field and radiation that wreaks havoc on their systems.  They also find the remnants of survivors of the planet Dokaal, scraping out an existence among the asteroids on constructed mining colonies, alone for several hundred years.  The survivors hope to terraform a planet further out in the system so that they can one day walk on solid ground again.  The Enterprise offers whatever help they can, but dissension is threatening to tear the Dokaalan apart before anything can be done.<br /><br />A Time to Sow is actually a lot better than I thought it was, once I get past the main fault (so I'll get it out of the way first).  It is extremely overwritten.  Long, very tedious introspection is the norm in this book, with Picard brooding about what happened in the first two books, Crusher brooding about not being able to save some of the Dokaalans killed in the explosion that brings the Enterprise to the mining colony, Picard again brooding about his decision to emergency transport some of the people who end up floating in space and how they ended up dying anyway.  He does this despite the fact that the Picard I know would realize if he hadn't done it, they were dead anyway.  What makes this particular brooding worse is that Picard *acknowledges* that they would have died anyway, but still keeps wondering if he made the right decision.  I think that's my problem with the whole series, so far.  They've turned Picard into this pod person who's awash in insecurities that I don't believe he would have.  However, since that ties into the whole series, I'll ignore that part for now.<br /><br />Excessive introspection is not the only way the book is overwritten, though.  A Time to Sow is very heavy in Trek continuity references, and the authors feel they have to go into great gory detail about every single one of them to explain the reference to the (one or two?) non-Trek fans who are reading the book. Ok, I exaggerate a little, but I think there is a way to more concisely explain the reference than Dayton and Ward use here.  Of course, there's an easier solution:  DON'T USE SO MANY REFERENCES!!  A few references, even explained in a couple of paragraphs, don't bog a book down.  When they are excessive, though, that means there are a lot of paragraphs used for explanation when they could be used for storytelling.  This is not good.<br /><br />The writing is so heavy-handed that it outweighs a lot of the good points of the novel.  The characters are, for the most part, well-written (even Picard is when he's not examining his situation for the one hundredth time) and the authors have created some interesting aliens in the Dokaalans.  The journal entries by the First Minister, Hjatyn, give us the history of the planet in a very interesting way that doesn't feel like an infodump (unlike the continuity references).  There are a wide variety of characters among the Dokaalans (though some who are more than they appear to be, to be revealed in the next book).The plot elements are tense and there are some good action scenes, especially the ending with Geordi and Taurik.  The romantic elements between Troi and Riker, which were a small part of the problem with Vornholt's books, are virtually non-existent in this one.  You can tell that they are together, but they act professionally when they are on the bridge together.  Everything regarding plot and characterization is done very well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, every time there gets to be a little tension, or something interesting starts to happen, the authors give us some interminable description or a lengthy monologue of a character's thoughts intrudes on the whole thing and brings the book to a screeching halt.  I love learning about characters through their thoughts, but sometimes too much is too much.  Introspection is a good thing.  Navel-gazing isn't, and that's what we get a little too often in this book.  Since it's pervasive throughout the entire book, neither author can be blamed for it.  They're both like that.  I've only read one other Ward book (his debut, In the Name of Honor, and it's a problem he's had since the beginning (at least the continuity reference problem).<br /><br />All in all, this isn't that bad of a book, it just gets tedious at times.  It splits the difference between Vornholt's two books, but it doesn't bode well for this whole series if the first three books are iffy at best.  I'm not holding out a lot of hope for book four.<br /><br />David Roybook).  The plot elements are tense and there are some good action scenes, especially the ending with Geordi and Taurik.

The television series always had problems with conclusions, and now the book series is following suit.  Unlike the television series, though, the book series is just taking flaws in the first book and expanding on them in the conclusion, making the final installment a step down from the first.  Such again is the case with Voyager's relaunch novel, The Farther Shore.  After writing my review for Homecoming, I read some other reviews that mentioned that Christie Golden's writing had way too many romance novel tropes.  While I don't necessarily agree with that for Homecoming (or at least I don't agree that they were prominent), it is true in spades with A Farther Shore.  The writing is trite and evokes too many \\"bodice-ripper\\" images for my taste.  If this is the way the relaunch is going to continue (and it evidently is completely Golden's ball, handed to her by the editors), then I hope she learns to rein them in.<br /><br />There are a lot of problems with this book, so I'll start with the good stuff.  Golden continues to write the regulars well, as far as characterization goes.  She's obviously a fan of the Janeway/Chakotay relationship, though she avoids them falling into bed together, instead giving them a \\"very close friends who could almost have been lovers\\" feel.  Hopefully, she'll keep it that way in subsequent books.  The friendship between them is very well done.  Seven is still a little too emotional, but she otherwise is also written well.  Torres, off on her own quest for her mother, is finally coming to terms with her dual-heritage, and the scenes between Torres and her mother are very interesting.  In fact, the sequences on Boreth with Torres are the best part of the book.  Too bad that they didn't have anything to do with the main plot.  Also, the Borg plot is interesting in its own way, though I truly hope this is the last gasp of the Borg.  Thankfully, the problem ends up being a lot less predictable than \\"they brought the virus with them,\\" which is nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the regular characters are done pretty well, the others are not.  The main villain of the piece, once revealed, is *way* overdone, sounding shrill at times. The Starfleet admirals that Janeway and others have to deal with also seem way too strident in their feelings toward the Voyager crew.  Also, the final resolution, as hard as it is to get there, ends up being way too simple when it finally occurs.  It's almost an afterthought, which is not a good thing.  The leader of the holographic rebellion is written way over the top, especially when we get the scenes in his fantasy world.  I found myself shaking my head way too many times in this book. I also have to wonder at the abrupt end to the holographic rights plot.  Perhaps this is going to be picked up in future books?<br /><br />Which leads me to the main problem with A Farther Shore:  the writing.  I can live with descriptions of men and women as \\"muscular\\" and \\"beautiful\\" without thinking a lot about it.  I think that's what many reviewers had a problem with in Homecoming.  But A Farther Shore takes it one step further, especially with characters we care nothing about.  There is a sequence where many Starfleet personnel, as well as other workers, are replaced by holograms, and the real people are placed in some holographic world where they are slaves to the holograms.  This is supposedly to teach them what it's like to be oppressed.  These scenes involve characters we aren't familiar with at all, and the limited scenes they have in the book before this happens just didn't make me care about them.  What's even worse, though, is the way the sequence is written.  It seriously is like a romance novel come to life.  Lieutenant Andropov is described as being extremely muscular, and the woman who he takes under his wing is quite beautiful.  He's old enough to be her father, and thankfully we are spared any romantic entanglements, but westill get prose that's ripped from the bodice of those novels.  It made me cringe every time Golden went back there.<br /><br />Finally, there is one major internal continuity gaffe that is so bad only because the scenes happen one right after the other.  In the first scene, the Trill doctor suggests that Data go off for the rendezvous with the other Voyager crewmembers by himself while he continues to work with the holographic Doctor in sickbay.  The very next scene, however, is the rendezvous, and the Trill is right there.  He speaks quite a lot, and it's obvious not a communication from sickbay.  He is right there.  Surely this should have been caught in editing even if Golden was writing the scenes out of order and forgot this?<br /><br />A Farther Shore has an interesting premise with some good characterization (but some horrible characterization too), but the writing just fails it.  Romance-lite, overbearing and overdrawn, this book just seems such a let-down after Homecoming.  Problems that were below the radar rear their ugly head, and don't bode well for the series.  I hope Golden can do better than this.<br /><br />David Roy, but we still get prose that's ripped from the bodice of those novels.

After the battering given to it by A Time to Die, my faith in Star Trek novels is restored.  Thank you, Christie Golden!  The first book in the Star Trek: Voyager line of books set after the television series is Homecoming, and it is quite good.  It does everything that the show should have done.  The show ended with Voyager coming home, being greeted by a bunch of starships.  What they should have done is to get home and then deal with the aftermath a little bit.  Homecoming takes care of that in a really effective way.<br /><br />After Voyager's return, it's decided that they should take their time making their way to Earth so that the crew can get a bit more adjusted to the fact that they are no longer stuck millions of light years away from home in the Delta Quadrant.  There are the expected meetings:  Admiral Paris sees his son, Tom, for the first time, along with his new wife and daughter, Tuvok is cured of the disease that struck him in the final episode by a mind meld with his son.  Once back on Earth, the welcome is a bit more muted than the crew had expected.  Each debriefing is less than an hour, rather than the expected lengthy ones.  There are reunions with family and with lost lovers (or ex-lovers), and things actually seem to be going pretty good.  But Harry Kim's girlfriend, Libby, has a secret she can't share with him.  She's investigating a conspiracy within Starfleet to turn over Borg technology to the Orions, and Voyager's return makes that even more important.  Plus, a something strange is happening in various places on Earth.  Some humans are sprouting Borg implants.  Is Voyager to blame for this?  Not to mention the fight for holographic rights by an insane zealot who wants to enlist Voyager's Emergency Medical Hologram!<br /><br />Homecoming is the first of a two-part book (I seem to be reading a lot of those lately), and it sets up a lot of intriguing situations.  Voyager had so much to do with the Borg, whether it is Seven of Nine or Icheb (one of the Borg children who they also brought home with them), that it's not surprising the first story after the series would involve them.  However, Golden avoids a lot the usual ways of portraying the Borg, and it may all be a smokescreen anyway.  The story also has the \\"Photonic Rights\\" angle that began in the series and carries it to a new level.  Finally, Golden takes the episode \\"Barge of the Dead\\" and takes B'Elanna Torres (chief engineer of Voyager) on a spirit quest to find the mother who she thought was dead.  All of these stories, I'm assuming, will tie into each other in some way, though it's not apparent as to how.  Golden builds the mystery quite effectively.<br /><br />The pace of the book is quite slow at first, as we get the reunions and getting used to life back on Earth out of the way, but this is a good thing because Golden does such a great job on the characterization.  We see a lot of the meetings that we wanted to see in the show, such as Janeway and her ex-lover and his wife, or Harry with Libby.  Most effective is Seven of Nine, who ends the (very silly) romance with Chakotay that came out of nowhere in the last season of the show because she doesn't know how she'll fit in on Earth.  She goes to stay with her aunt, but is met by a crowd.  She had always been apprehensive about returning to Earth because of the fear reaction she expected by the people of Earth, but instead they treat her like a celebrity.  She has no idea how to deal with this, and ends up almost turning the many supporters who just want to see her into an angry mob.  It's a very effective scene, illustrated most by the young lieutenant who is assigned to pilot her.  He begins by almost being in awe of her, but by the time he fights his way through the crowd he's irritated with her for her manner.<br /><br />Throughout these sequences, we get little hints of the story coming up.  Brief snippets of Libby and her boss in Starfleet Intelligence, ofpeople sprouting Borg implants, and the like.  There are also periodic scenes tracing the sexual abuse of an unidentified woman from age three to age fifteen, which seem very out of place in a Star Trek book (I guess that's why Golden was also the author of the Dark Matters series of Voyager books!).  However, they seem to be leading to something that will revealed in the next book.  Golden keeps the identity of this woman a very close secret, and I didn't guess who it was until the very beginning of that next book.  All of these just increase the tension in the story, even among all the happy reunions.  There's also the mystery of why the crew debriefings are so short, but that isn't handled quite as well.  I'm still not sure exactly why that was, though maybe it will also be revealed.  The crew senses something is wrong, but can't quite put their fingers on it.<br /><br />Along with the atmosphere, Golden does a wonderful job with characterization of virtually everybody.  Golden walks the fine line between character interaction and telling an interesting plot.  She doesn't allow scenes to drag on too much and the dialogue is actually interesting, making even scenes where a couple of people are talking seem vibrant.  Each character is almost perfectly done, the only minor problem being Seven is just a bit too quick to smile on occasion.  She even uses Captain Picard to good effect, but doesn't allow him to dominate the book.<br /><br />This is the way a Star Trek novel should be.  I can't wait to read theconclusion.<br /><br />David Royence, of people sprouting Borg implants, and the like.

The crew senses something is wrong, but can't quite put their fingers on it. <br /> <br />Along with the atmosphere, Golden does a wonderful job with characterization of virtually everybody.  Golden walks the fine line between character interaction and telling an interesting plot.  She doesn't allow scenes to drag on too much and the dialogue is actually interesting, making even scenes where a couple of people are talking seem vibrant.  Each character is almost perfectly done, the only minor problem being Seven is just a bit too quick to smile on occasion.  She even uses Captain Picard to good effect, but doesn't allow him to dominate the book. <br /> <br />This is the way a Star Trek novel should be.  I can't wait to read theconclusion. <br /> <br />David Roy	2004-11-13

And what a clunk it makes.  Star Trek novels have their detractors, but I'm not one of them.  This one, however, almost makes me change my mind.  There is so much wrong with this book that I don't know where to begin.  Just to start at the easy part, how about a summary?<br /><br />After the destruction of the Ontailian ship at the Rashanar graveyard in A Time to Be Born, and after the Ontailians destroy the starship Juno, Captain Picard is back on Earth being held in a mental institution for ongoing medical tests.  He has accepted a deal that will avoid a court martial, but he is determined to discover what really happened at Rashanar, site of one of the fiercest battles of the Dominion War.  To clear his former captain, Acting Captain William Riker takes the Enterprise, with a skeleton crew, back to Rashanar to find out what the Ontailians are really hiding at the graveyard.  Thankfully, he has the help of Picard, the counselor performing his medical evaluation, and an old friend.  Wesley Crusher is back, and he's determined to help the Enterprise and his old captain, even if it means he can no longer be a member of the mythical beings called \\"The Travelers.\\"  However, death and destruction await them amidst the wreckage of so many ships.<br /><br />A Time to Be Born was a book about Picard (and a little bit of Data).  Wesley was in it, and he actually became a little annoying prancing around during the inquiry back at Starfleet command (the only annoying part of that entire section of the book).  But it was Picard's book.  A Time to Die makes the whole thing Wesley's story, and it really suffers for it.  I have never been a Wesley detractor as so many Star Trek: The Next Generation fans have been, but he's never been a favourite of mine.  However, this book has a lot of Wesley using his Traveler powers, jumping from ship to ship to planet to outer space, observing things.  He almost makes things too easy, despite Picard's insistence that they can't begin relying on him.  Wesley is a Deus ex Machina throughout the entire book, except for the fact that the book is actually about him so maybe that term doesn't apply.  Still, it does make the book less interesting.  He convinces Picard's counselor of what happened by whisking her away to the Rashanar graveyard, something she must find very erotic because the next time she sees him she's all over him.<br /><br />Which brings me to why this book suffers so much.  First, Wesley's actions and manner are incredibly annoying, making me want to blow him out an airlock at times.  Secondly, the relationship that develops between Wesley and Cabot comes literally out of nowhere.  One minute, she's resisting releasing Picard, and then after Wesley takes her to Rashanar, she's suddenly hot for him?  And he for her?  Yes, he does find her attractive in their first scene together, but to go from \\"finding her attractive\\" to \\"being all over each other\\" in the span of a few pages?  And then to have their relationship be this intense love that makes neither one of them want to be apart from one another?  The whole thing is ridiculous, and every time they were together I wanted to belt them one.  Then, her inevitable fate is so perfunctorily done that it had no affect on me whatsoever.  I also found that this relationship brought out a giddiness in Cabot that just suddenly manifested itself too.  She does almost a complete 180 degree turn in attitude that I just can't fathom.  Yes, love can change somebody like that, but when I don't buy the love story, I certainly don't buy the character change.<br /><br />There are other characters problems, too, though most are ok.  The most striking is Admiral Nakamura, who goes from an almost ruthless man in a meeting with a character to crying over that character's death at the end.  The first part I thought was very good, but I certainly didn't buy the crying, at least not for that character.  Vornholt once again gets the regulars right, though that's coloured by Cabot's presence in so many scenes.  Wesley's reluctance to reveal himself to his friends is very pertinent (he thinks the more he reveals himself, the more likely it is that he will lose his powers), but it makes for some very awkwardly done scenes between when both he, his mom, Cabot, and others are in a room together.<br /><br />I'm looking for something positive to say about this book, and I'm having trouble.  The scenes that don't have either Cabot or Wesley in them are usually well done.  Unfortunately, there aren't many of them.  The mystery of Rashanar is interesting, especially the secret behind the creature in the graveyard.  Wesley also solves the problem in a very interesting way, fulfilling his vision from the beginning of the first book without allowing any of the main characters (who you know will survive, as Paramount would not allow their deaths) to die.  In fact, the entire concept is intriguing.<br /><br />It's just too bad that it had to end with such a bad book. A Time to Die is worth reading once, just to continue the story.  But try to beg or borrow it before wasting money on it.<br /><br />David Royleast not for that character.

Then, there was the bright idea by Pocket Books to tell us what led up to the movie.  Thus was the \\"Time to...\\" series born.  It consists of a series of two-part stories by different Trek authors.  The first, appropriately enough, is A Time to Be Born, by venerable Trek novelist, John Vornholt.  It's an intriguing concept, as the movie had all of the characters ready to move off in different directions, and it would be nice to see how they got there.  How is the first book?  It's pretty interesting interspersed with some horribly dull parts.<br /><br />Rashanar is the site of one of the most horrific battles of the Dominion War, and it is now a floating graveyard.  Littered with wreckage and gravitational anomalies, the site has become a draw to many greedy species intent on salvaging as much as they can, most especially the Androssi.  The Enterprise is assigned security duties at this site, trying desperately to keep the scavengers away so that Starfleet can recover its dead.  However, hidden away in all of these fluxes and the warp in the space-time continuum is something sinister, something that can drain the power from any ship it discovers.  Their mission will bring Data to a decision point, a decision that could end Picard's career.  Unfortunately, the crew may not be alive long enough to care.<br /><br />There are some really good parts to this book and they make it well worth reading.  Unfortunately, there are a few too many scenes of various shuttlepods tip-toeing through the wreckage, playing dead, and otherwise flying around to make it a thoroughly engrossing book.  Vornholt tries to make these scenes interesting by providing a lot of character interplay, but he doesn't always succeed.  There were times when I was reading where I wished one of these ships would just explode so that *something* would happen.  I think I get what Vornholt was trying to do with these scenes, ratcheting up the tension by having it build through the reader not knowing what's going to happen, but sometimes enough is enough.<br /><br />Thankfully, there aren't too many of these scenes, and the rest of them are very good.  The scene where Picard, Data and LaForge explore the wreck of the Asgard is filled with tension, especially when they happen upon the Androssi for the first time.  There are also some good scenes between Geordi and Data as they are exploring, especially when they finally find what is hiding in the graveyard.  The pace finally picks up when the Enterprise gets back to Earth, even as the action slows down, mainly because I was intrigued by what was happening to Picard back there.  Would he be drummed out of Starfleet?  What would be the outcome of any court martial?  Did he do the right thing?<br /><br />Vornholt does a good job with the characterization for the most part.  He should, as he's been writing these characters for years.  The only character who felt a little off was Captain Leeden, mainly because she bounced between competent officer and screaming harpie and back again, sometimes in the same scene.  Unlike Counselor Cabot later in the book, Leeden does it for no apparent reason.  I know Rashanar is supposed to put everybody under a lot of stress, and she has been there for quite a while, but I just found this to be a little too drastic.  Vornholt nails the regulars, though.  He also has created an interesting race in the Androssi, and the two main ones we see (Ghissel and her pilot) are well done.  Ghissel is a woman on her way up, and the coup that she claims by pulling one over on Picard is nicely done.<br /><br />There is one bit of characterization that is really badly done, however.  That is the various romantic relationships.  Troi and Riker don't have very many scenes together as a couple, but the two Androssi do, and it's extremely juvenile.  It's also incredibly pointless, considering what happens to them.  While I found Ghissel and interesting character, I didn't find that this relationship added anything to her character at all, and I have to wonder why it was included.  Even some of the descriptions of Troi and Riker are a little too \\"cute\\" for my taste.<br /><br />Overall, though, Vornholt has created a very satisfying novel.  Some bits of prose are a bit clunky.  I have no idea why he keeps introducing Wesley as \\"The Traveler\\" every time Wesley comes on the scene, and then starts using his name.  Wesley is a Traveler, but either use it consistently or just say Wesley.  Don't do both.  However, this is a minor point and Vornholt generally carries the reader's interest throughout.  Even the boring exploration parts are relatively short.  The second half of the book is wonderful, too, so don't' be disheartened if you find the first part even more boring than I did.  It does pick up.<br /><br />A Time to Be Born is a very good start to the series.  I'm hoping that the rest of the series continues this, or even picks it up.<br /><br />David Roydidn't find that this relationship added anything to her character at all, and I have to wonder why it was included.

US	50332419	R1YN4XPY3CKA57	0060013133	123160839	Going Postal: A Novel of Discworld	Books	5	8	9	N	N	The letters in this review are speaking to me!	It's autumn, which must mean it's time for a new Terry Pratchett book.  Now that I'm caught up with the old ones, I must admit this yearly wait is very agonizing.  So when I finally got my hands on Going Postal, I was almost drooling.  Thankfully, I didn't drool all over the pages, but I could have!  The good thing is that Pratchett made it well worth the wait.  A bit of dragging in the middle couldn't keep me from saying it is yet another wonderful book.<br /><br />Moist Van Lipwig (don't laugh) is a con man who's at the end of his rope.  Literally.  However, he doesn't hang from the rope for long enough to kill him, just long enough for his various aliases to die.  He is then whisked to the office of the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, Vetinari.  Vetinari is his guardian angel, giving him two choices:  get the long-abandoned Ankh-Morpork Post Office up and running, or walk out the door behind him.  Since Moist knows what awaits him outside that door (or, better yet, what *doesn't* await him, like a floor), he chooses the first option.  Of course, he doesn't do it completely willingly.  He has a golem guarding him, willing to track him down however far he runs if he does so.  Moist shows up at the Post Office to find it almost buried in old letters, some as old as a hundred years.  However, letters speak, and letters that are put together into sentences and put onto paper speak even more.  They speak to Moist of their desire to get to where they are supposed to have gone.  As Moist begins to make the Post Office more and more of a success, the conglomerate running the Clacks system into the ground becomes very interested.  The Clacks are a series of towers that stretch from one city to another so that messages can be sent quickly.  Can the power of the Post ever beat the power of electronics?<br /><br />Once again, Pratchett makes wry observations about the human condition and writes a very amusing story around it.  As time has gone on, Pratchett has avoided doing parody and instead takes a modern day situation and turns it just enough on its head for it to be funny *and* speak to the reader.  It's yet another book (like The Truth) that has one man start up something that exists in our world but doesn't exist (or, in this case, hasn't for some time) on the Discworld.  In this case, it's the Post Office.  Some have seen a parallel to the telegraph as far as the Clacks are concerned, but I almost see it as more of an email thing.  I think that also makes the book more timely, as the whole \\"mail vs email\\" contrast is a real issue.  People complain that nobody writes letters anymore when they can just send an email.<br /><br />However, this is not a book that demonizes the Clacks.  It's actually about power corrupting ruthless businessmen who will do anything for control.  The Clacks company was taken over (stolen is more appropriate) by a group of men who will do anything for money.  Yes, it's the evil businessmen again, which is getting old but it's something that Pratchett has avoided until now, so I'll forgive him.  It's also a novel about the human quality of hope.  Moist, in his past as a con man, has used that hope to further his schemes.  He ends up using that hope for the good in this book as he finds himself actually doing what's right for a change.<br /><br />The characters are all wonderful as usual.  Moist is a man who is torn between his previous self and the person who he seems to be becoming.  He keeps thinking about running away, but he doesn't.  In fact, he ends up using his abilities for the Post Office instead of his own greedy needs.  Miss Adora Bell Dearheart is probably the best character in the book.  She's an advocate for Golem rights, and she is steely on the outside.  She's used to protecting herself and not allowing anybody in.  Moist wants nothing but to worm his way underneath the stony exterior.  Watching these two interact is one of the highlights of the book.  The other characters are also winners, butespecially Vetinari.  He is as devious as ever, a benevolent tyrant (and aren't those the best kind?) who will do anything for the good of the city that he runs.  Watching his mind work is a treat.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say about this book is that it does drag in the middle.  At least it did for me.  I can't put a specific place to it, but the pace just seemed to dip a little bit.  It quickly picked up, though, and the last eighty pages are a real treat as Moist challenges Glint (the head of the Clacks consortium) to a race to see who can get a message to Genua, two thousand miles away.  The pace is frenetic here, and the end result is wonderfully done.<br /><br />There are a couple of oddities in this one, and while I'm sure they are intentional, I'm not sure what those intentions are.  First, there are actually chapters, which don't exist in Pratchett books besides the young readers series (Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky).  Secondly, these chapters have short little teasers sub-headings before the chapter actually starts.  These take a bit of getting used to, but they actually work out really well.<br /><br />This is definitely a must read for any Pratchett fan.  It's also a book that can be read by almost anybody.  The social commentary is wonderful, the writing and wit has to be seen to be believed, and it's just an enjoyable book.<br /><br />David Royers, but especially Vetinari.

It's not that Realms of the Underdark is necessarily *bad*.  Around the time that this stories were written, Drow elves (the evil dark-skinned elves that live deep underground and worship the dark spider-goddess Lloth) were all the rage in Forgotten Realms books.  They must still be popular, as I never fail to see a new Drow book out there.  It's only natural that TSR (before Wizards of the Coast bought them) would want to take advantage of such cool creatures.  Drizzt Do'Urden was the coolest of the cool, an exiled Drow who is actually a hero.  Of course, he features in one of the Realms of the Underdark novellas. Surprisingly he isn't really the star of it, but it does explain something of his past.<br /><br />The problem is that there just isn't really anything exciting or original about any of the stories.  Of the stories, one is very good, one is pretty bad, and the rest range from \\"bland\\" to \\"pretty good.\\"<br /><br />Getting the poor story out of the way first is \\"A Slow Day in Skullport,\\" by Ed Greenwood.  Greenwood is one of the masters of the Forgotten Realms setting, and he is determined to show it.  Unfortunately, it's one of the more by-the-numbers entries in the book (and that's saying something!).  Three of the Lords of Waterdeep, former adventurers who have retired to positions of wealth and power in the big city, find themselves on yet another adventure.  Durnan, owner of the Yawning Portal and master of the entrance from Waterdeep into the Underdark, receives an image of a young noble girl in trouble, and is determined to rescue her.  He sends a message to his friend, Mirt the Moneylender, who then alerts his friend Asper of the potential danger.  He suspects a trap.  Sure enough, it is, as Durnan is attacked by a Beholder, a floating creature with a huge eye in the center and a bunch of eyestalks, all of them able to shoot bolts of energy and other magical attacks.  Durnan is the object of the Beholder's plan, and his friends have to come to his rescue.  I'm not sure I can really say how bad this story is.  I could almost hear the dice rolling during the battle scenes and there's no flow to them whatsoever.  Greenwood also can't resist inserting Elminster into the story.  Elminster is the greatest mage in the Realms and the character that Greenwood played when the Realms was a gaming world.  He's in there for no apparent reason.  Either that, or the story will be continued elsewhere, as other seemingly unrelated events happen as well.  If true, that's a real minus for this story. What's even funnier is the sequence where Mirt is constantly attacked by various creatures of the Underdark and just swats everything away without raising a sweat.  These characters don't feel like they're in any danger whatsoever, even when things start looking bleak at the end.  Why should I care about these people?  Ultimately, I didn't, and struggled to get through the story.  Seemingly invincible characters are dull to read about.  Next!<br /><br />The final story, \\"Volo Does Menzo,\\" is a wonderful conclusion written by Brian M. Thomsen.  Percival Woodehous (or Pig, as he's known in Skullport) is a down-on-his-luck maitre'd who was the best in Waterdeep before being disgraced and forced to find what work he can in sinister Skullport.  Volo, the infamous travel guide writer, was the cause of his distress, and Pig is surprised when he finds Volo in a tavern that Pig frequents.  Determined to talk to him, he gets mixed up in an attack on Volo by two bumbling Drow disgraced warriors.  It is said that Volo intends to write a guide to the Drow home city, Menzoberranzan, and they can't have that.  Does Volo have something else up his sleeve?  Or will both of them be put to death for the warriors' cleansed honour?  This is a delightfully funny tale with the characterization of Volo being perfect.  He loves the sound of his own voice and regales both tavern customers and his guards with tales of his travels all over the Realm.  He's alsodevious, as his ultimate plan demonstrates.  He has a terrific memory, as he ultimately does remember what happened to Percival (though it would have been nice if he had explained exactly what happened).  Percival is also well done as the master chef, out of his element in a situation not of his making.  I found the two bumbling Drow hard to get used to at first, because we've never seen one before.  They are usually brutally efficient.  However, their characterization grew on me, though Thomsen does go a little too far with their denseness.  Still, the situations are hilarious, especially the confrontation with the two fish creatures, the Kuo-toa, that Volo and Percival witness when they're supposed to be asleep.<br /><br />With one great story (\\"Volo Does Menzo), one good story (\\"Rites of Blood,\\" by Elaine Cunningham), and three iffy ones (\\"Sea of Ghosts,\\" by Roger E. Moore, \\"The Fires of Narbondel,\\" by Mark Anthony, and \\"A Slow Day in Skullport\\"), this collection ultimately isn't that good.  If you're a fan of the Forgotten Realms, you may enjoy these novellas.  Otherwise, you should probably stay away.<br /><br />David Roys also devious, as his ultimate plan demonstrates.

US	50332419	R19WJ3W3BHVB1E	0765308657	257709592	Black Brillion: A Novel of the Archonate	Books	5	8	8	N	N	A book about a cop *and* about the mind?  Unthinkable!	I've been a big fan of Matthew Hughes since reading his Henghis Hapthorn stories in Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine.  When I got the chance to review a copy of his new novel, Black Brillion, I jumped at the chance. Black Brillion shows off more of Hughes' characteristic wit and wonderful ideas in a package that, while at times a little off the beaten path, is still well worth reading.<br /><br />Black Brillion takes place on \\"Old Earth,\\" which is what our current planet is called in a universe where space travel and colonization has been going on for centuries.  Baro Harkless is an Archonate Bureau of Security trainee, on a mission to capture the elusive swindler, Luff Imbrey.  Doing so is not the end of the line for Harkless, however.  He is quickly elevated out of the training program and given his first mission:  to go undercover amongst a group of people sick with \\"the lassitude,\\" a sickness that eventually leads to catatonia and death.  A man who calls himself Father Olwyn claims to have a miracle cure, the mystical \\"black brillion, but he is in truth the swindler Horselan Gebbling.  Unfortunately, Harkless finds out that his partner in this mission is the man he has just incarcerated, Luff Imbrey, former partner of Mr. Gebbling.  What results is a journey across a barren wasteland, but also a journey of the mind.  One of the persons in group of hopeful patients and loved ones is a historian (Guth Bandar) who is also a no&ouml;naut, one who travels to the dream realm known as the Commons.  Baro's exploration of the Commons will have a great effect on his investigation.  It will have an even greater effect on his life.<br /><br />Black Brillion begins as a typical police procedural with a little bit of a twist (though it's been done before).  The cop is assigned a criminal to be his partner because the criminal is familiar with who they are hunting.  With this rather pedestrian premise as a start, Hughes blows everything up.  The book becomes more about the no&ouml;sphere and Baro's journey inside himself than it is about the actual swindle.  Of course, all of it is tied together (it would be a very disjointed book if it wasn't), which does mitigate that fact somewhat.  Baro's journeys throughout the Commons, with the Bandar as his somewhat reluctant (and sometimes actively hostile) guide, are usually very interesting, though there are occasions where the journey tends to drag on a bit too long.  Hughes uses the Commons to explore common archetypes in fantasy and science fiction:  the Hero, the Wise Man, and others.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this has the side effect of sidelining Luff throughout much of the latter half of the book, which is a shame as he was my favourite character.  When these two characters are together, their points of view clashing like a debate between Bush and Kerry supporters, their dialogue is crackling and the book shows a lot of humour.  In fact, most of the humour is between these two characters, making the rest of the book a little dry.  Luff continually points out the short cuts that Bureau agents have to take in order to get things done (arresting somebody they know is guilty and then finding the evidence, for example) and Baro takes offense at each one of these statements.  He's an idealist and he believes that the Bureau can do no wrong.  It's refreshing in a genre where the \\"cop\\" character is usually cynical and the only good person on the force. Luff continually outthinks Baro, which does call into question the seeming ease with which Baro caught him in the first place.<br /><br />Hughes has created a bunch of other interesting (and somewhat bizarre) characters as possible suspects and/or dupes of Gebbling.  All of them have their brief moments in the sun, and the conversations between them make for some nice comedy as well.  A couple of them are determined to believe \\"Father Olwyn's\\" treatment of chanting different mantras and increasing their \\"chuffs\\" will cure them of their lassitude.  They contribute to some of the philosophical discussions that Hughes gives us, provide some lighter moments, and then disappear as what's really going on begins to manifest itself.<br /><br />What really makes this novel interesting, though, are the ideas behind it.

US	50332419	ROEZUZ0YREHHY	0345440676	549569088	The Charnel Prince (The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone, Book 2)	Books	5	31	34	N	N	A great modern fantasy epic continues	With The Briar King, Greg Keyes created a masterpiece of a first book, so much so that it would be almost impossible to keep it up at that level.  He tries very hard, however, and almost succeeds.  The Charnel Prince suffers a bit from \\"middle book syndrome,\\" but not as much as some series I've seen.  Keyes keeps the tension high, introducing some wonderful characters to take the place of those killed off in The Briar King.  The book is marred only by a massive coincidence that, while it can be explained, still strains the suspension of disbelief a bit.<br /><br />The biggest compliment I can give to Keyes is that I wish this series was done.  Right now.  I want to be able to read the rest of this and see how it comes out.  Unlike The Briar King, Keyes ends this book on a bit of a cliffhanger.  While Keyes doesn't break up the action with a vivid cliffhanger, one of the main characters is dealt a massive blow in a truly horrifying epilogue that shows just how evil one of the villains can be.  What's even worse (or better, you could say) is that I had really grown to love this character, which made the ending even more of a shock.  It left me with a pit in my stomach, which to me demonstrates just how good the characterization was.<br /><br />Keyes continues his deftness at this characterization.  Princess Anne is probably the best, as she grows up a lot in the span of six months or so.  I guess running for your life will do that to you, but most of the haughtiness has left her by the time she reaches her final scene.  She's done the work of washerwomen, been threatened with a marriage fostered in darkness, and realized that the love of her life isn't quite as pure as she had always believed.  All of her arrogance has been blunted by the news of the deaths in her family as well as the mystical fate that seems to be in store for her.<br /><br />Even better is Leoff, the composer who is on a journey to take a royal commission in the capital, not realizing what he's getting into.  He's the true innocent, doing what he believes is right no matter what the consequences.  The music in his heart and all around him captivates him, and the chance to write a piece of music that is unlike all others, despite what the church might say, draws him like a moth to a flame.  His relationship with young Mery, who he finds hiding in his room, is wonderfully charming and innocent, as he takes the young girl under his wing and teaches her music.  It's interesting to watch him deal with all of the political maneuvering going on around him because he is such a non-political creature.  While he agrees to help Queen Muriele by composing a piece that will be unmatched, we get the feeling that he's doing it more to compose a piece like that than because he truly wants to help her.  He is a good man, however, trapped in a world that could chew him up too easily if he missteps.<br /><br />There are too many other characters to name them one by one, but they are all wonderfully done, with the small exception of Robert.  He comes off a little flat in this one, possibly because of his circumstances.  Thankfully, those circumstances do ultimately become interesting as we find out why he's around and what those circumstances are, as well as what they mean for the rest of the world.  He is still, however, rather dull by himself.  That he is the only one is a marvel, though, considering how many characters populate this book.  Even the bit parts are well-rounded, given enough depth to be interesting even without delving deep into their background.<br /><br />Everything else about the book is great, as was the first book.  The prose, the world-building, everything.  Keyes has created living, breathing societies that are all interrelated yet distinct.  The religion is especially interesting.  One can mildly criticize him for making yet another series where the church is on the side of the bad guys, but there are enough holy loners to make it clear it's not the religion itself at the center of the evil.  It's just the men who have climbed to the height letting the power get to them.<br /><br />The only bad thing about the book is the massive coincidence that brings together three of the disparate plotlines to the same place at the exact same time at the end of the book.  Two of the three can be explained, as one of the characters is desperately tracking another before it's too late.  However, the third one just stretched my allowances a little too far.  It wasn't enough to completely destroy the book, but it might have if the rest of the book had been found wanting.  Thankfully, the book itself holds your attention and won't let it go, so it's easy to allow this coincidence, notice it briefly, and then discard your annoyance because everything else is so good.<br /><br />The Charnel Prince is a captivating read that grabs you, forces you through the ringer along with its characters, and then dumps you just when you want the book to go even further.  I will be anxiously awaiting the third volume.  Greg Keyes should be very proud of himself.<br /><br />David Royt the religion itself at the center of the evil.

I bought The Briar King, by Greg Keyes, a while back because everybody told me that it was so good.  However, I found myself reluctant to start yet another epic fantasy series, so it languished in my \\"To be read\\" stack.  Then, I received a review copy of the second book in the series, The Charnal Prince, so I decided I should probably read both of them soon.  I tell you this not because you should necessarily care what I do (what a man reads is really his private business unless he writes reviews about them), but so that you can avoid doing the same thing I did.  If you like fantasy at all, you should go out, get this book, and maybe even the second book, and read them.  Right now.  Go ahead.  I'll wait.<br /><br />Oh, you want me to tell you why you should read it?  Ok.  Keyes has created a masterpiece with vivid characters, an interesting overarching plot, and a doom from the dawn of time.  This is not your ordinary doom from the dawn of time, though.  The Briar King is a force of nature that is never truly understood, something that's called forth to wreak havoc on the land, changing this world into its own gruesome image.  With this book, Keyes is well on his way to reshaping that world.  We follow a disparate group of characters, including a king, his queen, a young knight who becomes her protector, a couple of princesses, and a fencer who becomes infatuated with one of those princesses.  On the other hand, we have the guardian of the King's Forest, his lover, and a monk who finds himself translating some very ancient, and very evil, documents, much to the detriment of the world, not to mention his own skin.  A conspiracy is afoot throughout the land, one which may bring down an entire royal family, and one which may result in the death of everybody.  Everywhere.  Treachery abounds, and nobody is safe.  Will the coming of the Briar King make this all moot?<br /><br />Keyes does almost everything right in The Briar King.  He switches settings with a deftness I haven't seen in quite a while, leaving each scene just when it's starting to get good.  This causes the reader to read the traditional \\"just one more chapter\\" to find out what's going on.  I average about one hundred pages a day usually, and I know I at least doubled that with this book.  Every character is completely three dimensional, with the exception of Fend, one of the villains of the piece.  I found him a bit flat, but otherwise, all of the characters are interesting.  Keyes also takes the story in some unexpected directions.  A love affair that seems very predictable doesn't, in fact, happen.  There are some daring escapes, but each one is plausible, not stretching that oh-so-important suspension of disbelief that some fantasy novels break constantly.  Each character has a completely understandable motivation that keeps the book moving at a lightning pace.<br /><br />Keyes also does a wonderful job of world-building.  The map is beautiful (he credits Kirk Caldwell for it) and the land is populated with a dazzling array of cultures, all of them suitably human but different enough that you can tell the difference.  One area, Vitellio, is clearly patterned after medieval Italy, even down to the names which sound pseudo-Italian.  This has the double benefit of giving you an idea what the culture is like but it's just different enough.  He also has a talent for languages.  The language in Vitellio is one example, but others have been made up as well.  He even goes so far as to invent dialects and slang for some of the people.<br /><br />Finally, I have to compliment Keyes on the prose in the book.  The imagery is amazing and the action scenes are extremely well choreographed.  They are realistic, and blood does flow vividly, but he's not so graphic that heads are bouncing all over the place (though one or two of them do).  Whether it's a quiet scene or a loud scene with swords bouncing off of plate armour, Keyes does a great job with it.  Here's an example:<br /><br />\\"Asper White opened his eyes to a vaulted stone ceiling and a distant, singsong litany.  Fever crawled like centipedes beneath his skin, and when he tried to move, his limbs felt like rotting fern fronds.\\" Pg 382<br /><br />Best of all, Keyes is not afraid to kill any of his characters.  Some people think that George R.R. Martin is sadistic to his characters!  The body count is quite high, but none of the deaths are gratuitous.  Each one fits the story perfectly, though some are quite perfunctory.  Even these, however, don't feel out of place.  Instead, they are realistic.  While there are heroic escapes (and, admittedly, a couple of rather unrealistic ones), it's never a certainty that the viewpoint character will make it out of the scene alive.  Sometimes, a death is just a death.<br /><br />The Briar King is one of the best fantasy books I've read since Jennifer Fallon's series, and I think it even surpasses them.  Everything just comes together in a rich whole, making a juicy treat that will taste good with every bite.  And the best thing is, when you finish it, you can pick up the second book and wolf that one down too.  Sadly, it will be close to a year before the final book is out.<br /><br />David Roy: <br /> <br />\\"Asper White opened his eyes to a vaulted stone ceiling and a distant, singsong litany.

Have you ever read a book where the author is so vivid in describing a setting that it affects your mood while reading it?  Say you're reading about a festival and the author is so good that you not only feel like you're there, but you feel your spirits rise as the author describes the surroundings?  Sean Russell is that kind of author.  Unfortunately, it can work against him, too.  In The Isle of Battle, a large part of the action takes place in an oppressive swamp, so dank and dreary that it affects the reader as well.  That's the only explanation I can think of for why I disliked that book so much.  Perhaps I was a bit too harsh on it.  I still stand by the review, but perhaps the tone was a bit too critical.<br /><br />What can account for this change?  I just finished The Shadow Roads, the final volume in The Swans' War.  With one book, Russell has made up for everything that was wrong with The Isle of Battle.  The prose is still evocative, but this time the story keeps up with it.  While Russell still doesn't give us the story motif that I so loved in The One Kingdom, he also doesn't just pay it lip service as he did in the second book.  I was amazed at how good this book was, and it seems all Russell had to do was get the story out of the swamp.<br /><br />War between the Renne and the Wills has exploded with an invasion of the Isle of Battle.  While this conflict simmers, however, a war of a different kind is taking place.  A war to prevent the specter of Death from washing over the One Kingdom.  Three ancient sorcerers, their spirits inhabiting new bodies, have awoken and vie for the power over Death itself in a war that goes back thousands of years, to the formation of the One Kingdom itself.  Hafydd, dark knight and the new host for the evil Caibre, is trying to awaken Caibre's father and open the gateway to Death's domain.  Caibre's brother and sister, inhabiting bodies of their own, race through the shadowy lands to stop him.  If they can't, it won't matter what happens between the two families.  There won't be anybody left in the world to worry about it.<br /><br />There are so many things to recommend about The Shadow Roads, but the best thing is still the prose.  Russell has a way with description that I have only seen matched by Barbara Hambly, but in a much different way.  Hambly describes the everyday surroundings of her characters.  Russell concentrates more on the world itself.<br /><br />Russell doesn't just evoke the setting, though.  His descriptions of battle scenes are vivid, too.  They make you feel like you are there, experiencing everything the character is.<br /><br />The characters are another strong point in The Shadow Roads.  They all grow to some extent, and all have three dimensions.  The Valemen, who were innocents in The One Kingdom, have grown hardened to the violence that they have been forced into, yet they still contain that kernel of their former selves, sickened by what it is they must do to survive.  None of them come through this crucible the same as they went in.  It affects them in logical ways, with some tragic consequences as well.  Cynddl, the Fael storyfinder, is also extremely well done.  As they journey through the shadows, he is almost overcome with the horrible stories that he can feel emanating from the ground that has been host to many atrocities through the ages.  His final act in the book is extremely touching and fitting the character that we've seen throughout the series, a final gift that is logical in hindsight but one I never saw coming. There are too many characters to name, but not one of them is a cardboard cutout.<br /><br />The only mild complaint I have about The Shadow Roads is the climax of the story, which is comes a little out of left field.  I didn't think it was necessary for the character who commits the final act to have done so, as I found the character's arc interesting by itself without having to have been involved in the ultimate resolution.  Also, while I think the story motif came full circle in this book, it still felt a little detached.  In The One Kingdom, the motif was as much a part of Russell's narration as it was a part of the story.  This time, it's an element of the story but Russell doesn't really get the reader involved in it.  There's no message to it like there was in the first book, where Russell appeared to be saying that life is a series of personal stories that sometimes interact with others' stories.  This time, Cynddl's storyfinding is just part of the plot.<br /><br />Sean Russell has saved his Swans' War series with this conclusion, making it well worth getting through the second book to get to it.  His world-building is wonderful, his descriptions of the various lands our heroes travel through put you into the story, and the politics in the \\"real world\\" make an interesting contrast to the mystical elements that everybody else is dealing with.  I was reading a discussion of George R.R. Martin and his Song of Ice & Fire series, and somebody said that The Swans' War series took some good influences from Martin.  I can't help but agree.  Go out and get this series now.  You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />David Roy.  Also, while I think the story motif came full circle in this book, it still felt a little detached.

He first joined the show in 1968, was the script editor for the entire Third Doctor era (1970-73), and has written many of the classic Who episodes. He's even written some of the new Dr. Who fiction since the television series ended.  Barry Letts was the producer for the entire Third Doctor era.  So you'd think that, writing a Third Doctor book, they could do no wrong.  Right?  Well, sort of.<br /><br />Deadly Reunion is a 40th anniversary Who special, and in doing that Dicks and Letts have written a wonderful homage to the TV show.  Unfortunately, what they forgot to do is make an interesting book.  Sure, there's a lot of Who nostalgia in it, especially Third Doctor nostalgia.  However, considering that Third Doctor fans are only a small part of a rather small to begin with fan base, you have to wonder who they're trying to cater to?  And why they couldn't write a good book on top of the nostalgia trip.  It can be done.  Not this time.<br /><br />Deadly Reunion throws in bits of Dr. Who clich&eacute;s all over the place.  There's the companion, running from the bad guys, tripping and injuring her ankle.  There's Sergeant Benton threatening to \\"thump\\" somebody.  There's the Third Doctor's Venusian Aikido.  There's the Doctor's penchant for name dropping (he talks about running with the bulls with Ernest Hemingway, or \\"Ernie\\" as he calls him). An old friend stopping by (though he's really inconsequential and obviously just in there for the anniversary). Sedate English village where trouble is brewing. It's all there, in point form.  Unfortunately, Dicks has also acquired some new, somewhat distasteful clich&eacute;s as well.  There's the numerous references to the possibilities of assault (first Sephie and then Jo), which just gave me the willies.  It's like your elderly uncle sitting down and telling you dirty stories.  Ick.<br /><br />Then there are the structural problems.  In fact, there's one huge internal continuity problem that I don't know how it was missed.  When Jo and the Doctor are going down to Hob's Haven to get tickets for the festival, it's supposed to take place \\"next week.\\"  Then, events happen, but they're all confined to one day.  All of a sudden, they're talking about the festival beginning \\"tomorrow night.\\"  Huh?  There's no mention of it being moved up.  In fact, the timeline is a bit suspect no matter how you think about it.  All of the sequences involving Sergeant Benton and Captain Yates seem like they would have to take place over a matter of a couple of days, but given the text of the book, it's impossible for them to have done so.  It all has to happen the same day.  It was enough to tax my mind as I was trying to figure out just what was happening when.<br /><br />I also had a problem with Lethbridge-Stewart falling in love that quickly.  He sees Persephone and he's immediately in love.  This is not like him at all.  However, there is no indication there was any kind of mind-control, even unconsciously, on Persephone's part.  She talks like she's instantly in love with him too.  It was just too unbelievable, even more so if you know Lethbridge-Stewart's character like most Who fans do.<br /><br />There are some good parts to the book, though.  With the exception of Lethbridge-Stewart falling in love so quickly, all of the main characters are tremendous.  These two authors know their Third Doctor and friends, and it's like old home week.  The Doctor is wonderfully arrogant but also kind-hearted.  He's offended when he's mistaken for one of the pop stars that are coming to the festival.  He's witty and I can almost hear Jon Pertwee's voice when he's thundering at the policeman who can't seem to realize that somebody cannot cut their own head off cleanly with a scythe.  Deadly Reunion was a wonderfully cozy book on this front.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as the book was drawing to a close, I couldn't see any way out of it but theobvious deus ex machina.  Granted, this was what the Doctor was trying to do in the first place, so I guess it doesn't totally fit that expression.  I was hoping, though, that he would fail and figure out some other way to defeat the menace.  I was wrong.  The ending is trite, and more importantly, doesn't even use the \\"love\\" that's between Persephone and the Brigadier.  When you think about it, there's no point for the love story between them, as it's only responsible for setting the brigadier off on a macho military plan that he ultimately would have decided to do anyway, even without the love story.  Why was this in there?  There's no \\"Aha!!  Lethbridge-Stewart!  So we meet again!\\" confrontation between the Brigadier and Hades.  They never even interact again! I was left shaking my head.<br /><br />I've gone on longer than this book probably deserves.  It's a bit of nostalgic fluff, and it won't amount to any more than that.  Thankfully, it doesn't try to.  It won't be of interest to anybody but a Who fan, as it's not well-written enough to attract anybody else.  Even a Who fan will see all its flaws.  The question will be:  are you so much a fan of Dicks and the Third Doctor that you will overlook it?  I'm glad I read it, but I won't be racing to read it again.<br /><br />David Royobvious deus ex machina.

In Dead Water, Barbara Hambly gives us what could be the last of the Benjamin January series of suspense novels (her web site says that a decision won't be made on further entries until next year).  If that is the case, she chose a more regular novel than usual to go out on.  It's not that it's a bad book, because I still loved it.  However, it's a lot more straightforward and not as intricate as past January books.  It's still worth checking out, though.<br /><br />In Dead Water, Ben & Rose are startled and frustrated to hear that the manager of the bank where they have all of their money (obtained in a previous adventure) saved in order to make their final payment on their house has stolen it all and is heading up the Mississippi river on a steamboat.  The new manager asks Ben to book passage on the same boat and attempt to figure out where the gold and bank notes are.  Ben engages the help of his old friend, Hannibal, in their quest, as Hannibal is able to act the role of master to Ben's slave to avoid suspicion.  Once they get on the boat, they stumble on to more intrigue than just a case of missing gold.  Secret affairs, slave trading, a voodoo curse and a man who makes a living stealing slaves complicate matters.  Ben has to sort it all out while still keeping his cover and not acting like an \\"uppity black man.\\"  It's a good thing there's a future president of the Confederacy on board, especially when the bank manager ends up dead.<br /><br />This sounds like a complicated plot, so why did I say it's more straightforward than usual?  Usually, the situation that Ben & Rose find themselves in is very complex.  Twists and turns abound and it can get confusing for the reader at times.  There were times where I wasn't quite sure what was going on.  This wasn't the case in Dead Water.  Instead, Hambly throws a lot of simpler plots at us, hitting us with quantity instead of complexity.  It doesn't work quite as well, though Hambly saves it with excellent characterization of everybody in the book.  The problem becomes that all of the plots are resolved almost simultaneously, and Hambly falls once again into the annoying habit of having a sudden gun battle resolve a few of them.  This has happened a bit too often in this series, and is probably the only fault.<br /><br />Once again, Hambly dazzles in terms of characterization.  Ben & Rose leap off the page, and Hannibal is his usual witty, sardonic and slightly opium-addled self.  The dialogue between the three of them is wonderful, and the other characters are quite good too.  Hambly captures their emotions perfectly.  When gets left off the boat, his panic at the thought of Rose being captured by a slave trader and sold away from him is palpable, and the tension is riveting.  The interaction between all of the other characters crackles as well, with animosity between the two slave traders, the romances and affairs that are all over the ship, and possibility of a voodoo priestess stowed away in the hold.  This is great stuff.<br /><br />It wouldn't be a Hambly review if I didn't mention the atmosphere.  Hambly sets the stage like nobody I've ever known.  She'll spend a couple of paragraphs just describing the setting where Ben & Rose are walking, allowing the reader to picture it vividly.<br /><br />The people that colour these descriptions have nothing to do with the plot, but I'll bet you get a picture of where Ben is.  As a reader, you dive into the setting, and you feel like you're on a steamship in the middle of the Mississippi.  Hambly's prose is quite evocative and it makes the book even more enjoyable.<br /><br />One problem for long time fans, and it's a problem with Days of the Dead, is the lack of Abishag Shaw, the New Orleans police chief.  He's the best character in the entire series, and he's been gone for a while.  For this reason, I'll be even sadder if this is the last book in the series.  On the other hand, it is nice that Hambly doesn't try to shoehorn characters into the story where they don't belong.  Some mystery novelists do that and it gets on my nerves.  Hambly avoids that trap.<br /><br />Dead Water suffers only in comparison to the other Ben January books.  There are a bit too many coincidences for it to be among the best.  However, it's still better than a lot of other books out there.  If this is Ben January's last hurrah, it's certainly not a bad one to go out on.haracters into the story where they don't belong.

US	50332419	R2FZPZ2ZHO4DZV	0743491718	679889805	Tales of the Dominion War (Star Trek: The Next Generation)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	More war stories	One of the unique (as far as Star Trek TV series go, anyway) things about Deep Space Nine was the two-year \\"Dominion War,\\" where the shapeshifters from the Gamma Quadrant allied with the Cardassians and waged war on the other Alpha Quadrant races.  Of course, being a television series about Deep Space Nine, the series couldn't really delve into what was going on in other parts of the Federation.  We get no clue what the crew of the Enterprise was doing, for example.  We hear about some things, of course, but mostly in the background.<br /><br />Keith R.A. DeCandido, editor of Tales of the Dominion War decided that these holes needed to be filled.  Since there is a lot of Trek franchises bouncing around these days, why not have a book of short stories that tell some of these tales?  You've got your title all made up for you, too, so you don't have to work very hard at that.  DeCandido lined up the best and the brightest of the current crop of Trek authors to give us a sampling of the huge events that took place during this war.  The stories are mostly good, but a few clunkers along the way as well as some good stories with questionable elements keep this from being a top notch book.<br /><br />Probably the best story is \\"Safe Harbor,\\" by Howard Weinstein.  Weinstein is the elder statesman of Star Trek books, having been involved with them since the very beginning (though I think he's been away for a while).  He tells the story of Admiral Leonard McCoy and Scotty, trying to get back to Earth in a clunky old ship.  It begins with a chilling image of a horrible attack on San Francisco, with Jim Kirk and Spock dying horrible deaths.  This image quickly moves to McCoy waking up and ultimately realizing that he's really old and that his faculties may be beginning to desert him.  They find safe harbor on a planet that prides itself on its neutrality in the war.  They're able to wrangle a few hours for repairs, but then they have to leave.  Soon, however, a badly damaged Federation ship also shows up, with all of its senior officers dead.  McCoy has to counsel the extremely young acting captain as well as deal with the news that San Francisco actually was attacked.  Dominion ships are in the area, searching.  Will they be able to convince a young engineer on the planet to let them stay long enough to finish all their repairs and hide from the Dominion?  This story had wonderful characterization (it should, as Weinstein always gets McCoy exactly right, even when McCoy's 150 years old) and an interesting dilemma.  McCoy is wonderful both with the captain as well as with the engineer, and Scotty isn't bad himself.  The story did have minor problems, however, which wrenched me out of the narrative.  The first was the lack of an explanation for the dream.  The dream was too exact for my taste, the only difference from real life being the involvement of Kirk and Spock.  Is McCoy suddenly a prophet?  And why isn't it mentioned again?  Secondly, the ending is a little bit too treacly for my tastes, almost drowning in patriotic sugar.  Still, it is a wonderful story.<br /><br />Of the rest of the stories, my least favourite was \\"Twilight's Wrath,\\" by David Mack.  This story involves Shinzon, from the movie Star Trek: Nemesis, and how he was able to gain some of his power.  He and his fellow Remans are ordered to mop up a Tal Shiar base that's been attacked by the Dominion, retrieving some items and making sure there's nothing left for the Dominion to find.  Of course, being Remans, they're seen as expendable, and they're not expected to survive (even going so far as to have them killed once they have accomplished their mission).  Shinzon outwits his Romulan superiors, however, and steals the information for himself.  Along the way, he finds out information about his past, including his birthright, which will propel him into the events of the movie.  This story was overly violent with a lot of hand-to-hand combat, severed limbs and other gut-wrenching things.  That's ok by itself, but Shinzon is not even the least bit interesting.  In fact, there's not a character in this story that I wanted to follow.  I was hoping they would all fall victim to a grisly death.  It does explain a couple of the inconsistencies in the movie, however.<br /><br />Finally, a story that just mystified me.  \\"What Dreams May Come,\\" by Michael Jan Friedman, is the story of a Vorta (one of the Dominion toadies who keep the footsoldiers in line) on an isolated Federation world conquered by the Dominion. It's a quiet little place and he's really set in his ways.  He has made servants of some of the local populace, but one of them isn't who he says he is.  He relates to the Vorta a dream that he had, one where his people attacked the Dominion base.  A dream that turns out to be all too real.  At its heart, the story is extremely basic, but that quality makes it really uninteresting.  If Friedman was trying to say anything with the story or do anything with it, I didn't catch it.  It just sits there.  While it's only a few pages long and doesn't take any time to get through, it does begin the book on a wrong note.<br /><br />Overall, I greatly enjoyed Tales of the Dominion War.  It was interesting to see all the difference facets of the Trek universe and how they dealt with the war.  There's even a couple of Deep Space Nine stories as well, which was nice.  Most of the stories are worth reading with some real gems in there as well.  Good stuff.<br /><br />David Royut-wrenching things.

US	50332419	RP32FAPP3GVLB	0743463560	656031494	1: Exodus (Star Trek: The Original Series--Vulcan's Soul Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A redemption of sorts	It's been a long while in between Star Trek books for Josepha Sherman and Susan Schwartz.  The last book, Vulcan's Heart, was a complete and utter disaster as far as this Trek fan was concerned.  The overuse of continuity, the bad characterization and annoying writing just soured me on it.  However, since I had enjoyed Vulcan's Forge so much, I thought I would give them a chance to redeem themselves.  Their latest book, Vulcan's Soul: Exodus, does bring them back up in my opinion.  The only problem is (and this could be a Pocket Books marketing decision, for all I know), it's a trilogy of hardcover books that really only needs two books, maybe even one, unless subsequent books are much longer than the first.  At a meager 264 pages, the first volume is very slight.  At hardcover prices, that's almost a crime, in my opinion.<br /><br />Vulcan's Soul: Exodus was surprising because, while I thought Sherman & Schwartz would be writing a sequel to Vulcan's Heart, I didn't realize it was going to be a trilogy in itself.  It's an interesting concept, as we learn even more about ancient Vulcan history.  I'm not sure how well it goes with Diane Duane's Spock's World, which also dealt with ancient Vulcan history, as I haven't read it in a long time.  I'd be interested in knowing.  Much like Spock's World, Sherman and Schwartz give us a book that jumps back and forth from now to history and back again.  Thankfully, they make both of these stories fairly interesting.  What I found even more intriguing was the conference between all of the Alpha Quadrant races that took place 14 years before the \\"current\\" events of the novel.  This is the super-secret conference Spock was attending when he hears that the inscriptions on the crown have been translated, bringing him back to Vulcan and enticing him to put it on.  The memories in this crown are what we are shown.  Is the conference itself important?  I hope so, because we never see it or hear of it again in the first book.  I'll be disappointed if it's not.<br /><br />In addition to this intrigue, I am anxiously looking forward to seeing how the history pans out.  If I'm not mistaken, Trek lore states that the violent Vulcans left to find their own planet when they would not follow Surak's teachings.  In this book, it looks like the logical Vulcans are the ones trying to leave.  I'm sure this discrepancy will be explained, and I can't wait to see how everything pans out.  That's one of the strengths of the book.  There are so many cool ideas and interesting premises that the book leaves the reader clamoring for more.<br /><br />Characterization is not forgotten, as Sherman & Schwartz do a wonderful job of it.  Most of my complaints from Vulcan's Heart are completely gone, with only a couple stubbornly resisting exorcism.  Spock & Saavik still act like teenage lovers at times (not in their actions, but in their thoughts that the authors share with us) which seems a bit out of character, but everybody else is nailed.  Chekov is a grown-up version of the young ensign he was in the Original Series.  He's much more responsible, but you can see the kid in him trying to burst out at times.  The scene in the holodeck where he's training the cadets, throwing one disaster after another at them, is priceless.  Uhura is as graceful as ever and, despite the fact that I never would have thought this before, she makes a wonderful chief of Starfleet Intelligence.  Even the characters in Vulcan history are really well done.  Karatek is the main character, and he's a Vulcan propulsion expert who is working on warships but thinks that resources and research should go to space exploration.  When he meets Surak and his followers, he goes on a journey with them, attempting to convince other Vulcans of the rightness of Surak's teachings.  He begins the book being extremely skeptical, but by the end, he is a seasoned leader, ready to lead his people across the depths of space.<br /><br />There are a few problems withthe book, but they are extremely minor.  The first should have been caught by an editor.  Three times in the space of a page, Surak is called \\"Sarek\\" by the narration.  This wouldn't be an issue if Sarek wasn't Spock's father and a major Trek character.  This was really minor, as it only happened in one sequence, but it was there.  The other problem (and this was new to my readings of Sherman & Schwartz) was a bit of repetition of character traits that I so despite in Harry Turtledove's writing.  They don't do it to nearly that extent, but it is there.  It's most prominent in the two children that Karatek ends up adopting.  In one scene, Kovar takes his \\"S name,\\" or the name he will take under Surak's tutelage.  Then, in the next memory sequence (after a sequence in the current time period), we are told that Solor used to be Kovar.  Yes, we know that.  You just told us that.  The same happens with his sister, and it got a bit annoying.<br /><br />Still, it's not enough for me to take any real points off.  This was a fantastic follow-up to Vulcan's Heart.  While it doesn't redeem that one, it certainly has brought their stock back up to where it was when Vulcan's Forge came out.  And that takes some doing.<br /><br />David Roylems with the book, but they are extremely minor.  The first should have been caught by an editor.

US	50332419	R1BST3IB00349C	0345457234	912625496	Return Engagement (Settling Accounts Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	4	11	13	N	N	The war begins and it all gets better?  Huh?	I'm glad I got that off my chest.  I have been anxiously awaiting the continuation of Harry Turtledove's alternate history series between the USA and the Confederacy since I finished The Victorious Opposition, mainly because that book was so bad and because I wanted to see how Turtledove did once he got back on a war footing.  I'm very happy to say that the improvement is so noticeable that it shines.  Yes, there are problems and annoyances, but for once they do not overshadow everything else.  This is the best book in the series since World War I ended.<br /><br />I'll get the main gripes out of the way first, because for the first time in this series, and for the second book in a row, I am going to praise Turtledove.  As with all the rest of the books in this series, the main criticism is the prose and dialogue.  Turtledove has an annoying habit of not only repeating character traits (more about that below), but also words and phrases used in narration.  Three times in the first 150 pages, there is a variation of somebody telling a dark joke or comment and everybody laughing because \\"laughing is better than screaming,\\" or something to that effect.  All three of them are in the same context too.  The city the character inhabits is being bombed and they are down in the shelter.  It's an understandable reaction, but it brings the narrative to a screeching halt every time he uses it.  It occurs a few more times later in the book, though it's not as obvious.  Also, the style of the writing is very plain and almost \\"down-home\\" simplistic most of the time.  There are a lot of \\"I'd love to tell you you're wrong, but you're right\\" type comments made from one character to another.  The dialogue is stilted and so is the narrative voice.  It does make the book a quick read, however.<br /><br />The second obvious problem is, as is always the case with Turtledove, character repetition.  I think every scene that contains Sam Carsten, a sailor for the United States, mentions how susceptible he is to sunburn.  That's the most blatant thing, but each character has a trait or two that keeps coming up every time the narrative comes back to that person.  We hear in quite a few Jefferson Pinkard (the camp commander mentioned above) scenes that every time the phone rings, it brings trouble from Richmond.  Some have claimed that the constant introduction of characters is to help keep them straight, but that is even less of a problem in Return Engagement than it is in Turtledove's other books, as the character count is quite low in this one.<br /><br />Thankfully, there are many pluses that outweigh these faults.  He has cleared away most of the dead character weight.  The annoying Nellie Jacobs is long gone, and her grandson isn't anywhere near as dull as she was.  He doesn't even introduce that many new characters to take their places, resulting in a much tighter story with a few different viewpoints.  Each character is there to give us a facet of the ongoing conflict.<br /><br />Having jettisoned the boring people, we have a nice mix of older and newer characters.  The most interesting has to be Sam Carsten (which makes it all the more annoying that he has the most repetition), who we have followed since the first book of the Great War, six books ago.  He has come a long way, working his way up from an enlisted soldier to the position he earns here.  He's straightforward, always intelligent and willing to speak his mind, and he's quite humble as well.  He's just a joy to read about (skin conditions not withstanding).<br /><br />There is another reason why this book is so much better than the last three.  It's extremely tight and focused.  All of the action regards the war in one way or another.  The characters' motivations are not scattered all over the map, allowing their boring sides to come out.  Also, the entire book takes just over 6 months, unlike the long years that each of the last three books encompassed.  Thus, events in one character'story can actually affect some of the other characters.  There isn't the isolation or the sense of events being glossed over that really turned me off before.  Also, the atmosphere that Turtledove presents is almost palpable.  He captures the horrors of living under a constant bombing very well (though, again, he does kill the mood a little bit by repeating it much too often).<br /><br />One other thing can either be a plus or a minus.  At the beginning of the book, Turtledove kills off one of his longstanding characters in a rather perfunctory fashion.  Personally, I loved it, for a couple of reasons.  First, it shows that he's not afraid to kill somebody off, even somebody who many people might have loved.  Who is safe when the author is willing to do that?  It adds to the sense of danger.  Secondly, I didn't really care for the character, and I wasn't looking forward to three more books with the character doing the same thing that has been done for six books now.<br /><br />Settling Accounts: Return Engagement shows that Turtledove is a much better writer when he involves military matters.  While the prose is still annoying, he more than makes up for it with this outing.  If you gave up on the series because of the lackluster American Empire segment, come back.  While all is not forgiven, you can stop holding your nose for a while.<br /><br />David Royne character' story can actually affect some of the other characters.

US	50332419	RO7Z8LZD8Z6QH	0345435745	419320069	High Druid of Shannara, Book 2: Tanequil	Books	3	8	11	N	N	I sense the downward spiral beginning...	Terry Brooks made his name with the Shannara series, coming back to it again and again in various trilogies (and one four-parter).  It got to the point where even some of his fans were saying \\"enough!\\"  They all started sounding the same with small differences (the Jerle Shannara trilogy took place across the sea, for one thing).  Then, Brooks came out with Jarka Ruus.  While still very similar in content, Brooks appeared to be taking the series in a bit of a new direction.  Now, we have the second book in the High Druid of Shannara trilogy, Tanequil  It's a step down from the first book, but not too bad.  Average is probably the best word for it (though I'm sure Brooks wouldn't think so).<br /><br />There's one major problem with Tanequil, which is that it's kind of boring.  It reads very much like all the other Shannara books (the main characters spend a lot of time brooding about their situation), but the action is much less.  Thus, we spend a disproportionate amount of time in the characters' heads, and it isn't that interesting.  Either the villain is musing over her plans for Grianne or ultimate power, the Prime Minister of the Federation is going over what he intends to do with a new weapon, or Pen is brooding over what the cost of his little expedition has been in lives and heartache.  What's even worse is that he repeats himself a little bit.  Why Shadea has to tell the reader multiple times that her current relationship is one of convenience that she's willing to throw away as soon as it's no longer useful is unclear.  This has always been a problem with Brooks, but he's always made up for it with exciting action scenes.  This time, he doesn't.  Compared to the rest of the books, there's relatively little.<br /><br />Even worse is that Brooks is either way too predictable or he thinks foreshadowing should be done with a hammer instead of a scalpel.  He never states anything just for atmosphere's sake.  Everything he says is going to be used or addressed at some point.  When Pen visits the Troll city and he mentions (seemingly in an off-hand manner) the layout of the city and how they are mobile creatures, ready to move at a moment's notice, you know that it's going to be a plot point eventually.  Other writers might use this to paint a broader picture of Troll society, but Brooks doesn't bother.  If it's there, it's going to be used.<br /><br />The last problem is that the most interesting character in the series, Grianne, is barely in the book, relatively speaking.  She doesn't appear for over one hundred pages, and then she's only in a few sections after that.  She's imprisoned the entire time, though at least Brooks makes good use of that to further the plot and give her some more hardships to endure.  As I said in my review of Jarka Ruus, Brooks hasn't really dealt with redemption, so her storyline has a lot of potential.  In the little space that she inhabits in Tanequil, she is put through the wringer and it's fascinating to see how she deals with it all.  It's just not enough to carry the rest of the book.<br /><br />On the plus side, Brooks does bring back Bek and his wife, Rue, Pen's parents.  They were two of the most interesting characters in the earlier trilogy, and I was disappointed when they didn't appear in Jarka Ruus.  They both get to demonstrate their devotion to each other as well as their quick wit and intelligence when they are set upon by the Druids.  Sadly, none of the other characters shine, though I can't really point to any of them and say that they were done badly.  Instead, they just sit there on the page and I found myself occasionally wishing Brooks would go back to somebody else.  This generally happened with Shadea, who suffers from being one of the least interesting villains I've read in quite a while.<br /><br />Finally, I have to give kudos for the demons and the Forbidding.  The atmosphere in the Forbidding is very tight, and when Brooks reveals the ultimate plan, it brings the book up to another level.  There's another villain besides Shadea, and the book really accelerates when he's on the screen.  Unfortunately, he's only there when Grianne is, which means he doesn't get a lot of time.  Sure, he's sort of a clich&eacute;, but he's miles above Shadea.  If Brooks continues the demon storyline to a satisfying conclusion, the last book should be a rocking read.<br /><br />Tanequil isn't really bad enough to avoid if you're following the Shannara series.  It just sort of sits there, taking up room until the next book.  If you read the first book and enjoyed it, this won't turn you off of the series.  It'll just make you wish the third book was already here.  I hope Brooks doesn't let us down.<br /><br />David Royngs the book up to another level.

US	50332419	RJA0JBY85WSKW	0670033596	795101432	Something Rotten	Books	5	5	6	N	N	There's something rotten in Denmark!	In Jasper Fforde's latest \\"fiction within fiction\\" book, Something Rotten, Fforde offers up more literary devices, stock characters, wishy-washy Danes, and violent bouts of croquet than you can shake a stick at.  Something Rotten is the fourth book in the Thursday Next series, and it appears to be the final one.  Ongoing plots are wrapped up and the novel seems to have a definitive ending for once.  The other books have ended their particular story, but there have always been plot threads hanging for the next book to pick up and run with.  Not this time.  Fforde also returns to form as this is the best book since The Eyre Affair.<br /><br />Thursday Next, intrepid literary detective and now head of the Jurisfiction organization (the official police force of fiction everywhere), has a lot on her plate.  Her husband, Landon, has been wiped from the timestream by the Goliath Corporation in an effort to get revenge on her.  Nobody remembers him but her, even though she has a son by him (Friday, of course).  Two years of being head of Jurisfiction has taken its toll, though, and she wants out.  She officially resigns (though everybody just sees it as taking a leave of absence) and comes out of the fiction world and into her own real one again.  Sadly, her problems are just beginning.<br /><br />First, her time-travelling father visits her and tells her that if the Swindon Mallets croquet team doesn't win the tournament next week, then the world will end three weeks later.  She has brought Hamlet with her from the fictional world, just in time for a wave of anti-Danish hysteria to sweep Great Britain (not to mention the fact that Hamlet discovers he's seen as a helpless ditherer in the real world).  Clones of Shakespeare are turning up dead all over the place, plus Thursday has to figure out how to smuggle ten truckloads of banned Danish literature into neutral Wales before the government can burn them.  A lot of this is being caused by Yorrick Kane, the decidedly fictional (but tell him that) man who wants to become the dictator of all England (and, perhaps, eventually ruler of the world).  With all of these balls in the air, can Thursday help but drop a few?  If she does, everything she knows and loves will come to an end.<br /><br />The last two books have dwelt largely in the world of fiction, thus neglecting the truly interesting world that Fforde had created.  Something Rotten changes all that, taking place almost completely in the real world, but with enough fictional elements and ideas to keep the book fresh.  Characters from the Jurisfiction organization continue to pop up and ask for Thursday's advice.  Hamlet is always an ongoing concern, especially when some of the other characters in the play rebel and create their own story, which causes Thursday to have to find a Shakespeare clone in order to write another original copy of Hamlet.  Thankfully, one of the things she's investigating is the death of Shakespeare clones!<br /><br />This brings me to one of the faults of the book.  There are just too many coincidences for my liking.  In a novel about literary devices, there are bound to be some coincidences.  However, Thursday is juggling many things at one time and the resolution of some of them just seems too convenient for me.  It would be different if there was a reason for them within the book (as there is a reason for the piano just happening to fall on the right person at the right time), but there's not.  It all seemed a bit too convenient.  Probably the worst example of this is the Wellington clones that just happen to show up at the perfect time to take care of the Napoleon clones running about.  It was just too much.<br /><br />For the most part, I was able to ignore these problems with just a roll of the eyes, as the rest of the book is a delight.  Fforde's trademark wit is fully evident, as he parodies bad political talk-shows and creates a full-contact version of croquet that makes it seem like American football.  Even the blurbs at the beginning of each chapter are usually hilarious.  In fact, not only is Something Rotten the best book since The Eyre Affair, it's also the most fun.  I haven't laughed out loud this much in ages.<br /><br />While I did find that Thursday had her problems solved a little too easily, it was still fun watching her deal with all of them.  She is characterized very well in this book, from her dedication to Jurisfiction (despite having left) to her love and devotion for her eradicated husband.  She gets more development here than she received in the last two books combined.  Unlike even The Eyre Affair, there are actually other characters as well who are fairly well-rounded (if a bit silly at times).  Hamlet comes off the best, as he's just enough like the character in the play to be recognizable, but he wants to be remembered as a man of action.  It hurts him that people see him as wishy-washy and he becomes determined to change that image.  His interactions with Thursday as she tries to prevent this are very amusing.<br /><br />The book ends with revelation after revelation that brings the previous books into a whole new light.  These almost come a bit too fast, as my head began to throb by doing double-takes, but they do make sense.  Some of the long-standing questions are finally answered, and we (and Thursday) come full circle.  It's a perfect place to end it, and I really hope Fforde decides to leave it.  Forcing more adventures after this would just seem extraneous.  Plus, he has gone out on a good note, and it would be shame to ruin that.  Something Rotten isn't rotten at all.  It's bloody wonderful.<br /><br />David Roycan football.  Even the blurbs at the beginning of each chapter are usually hilarious.

US	50332419	R2VLVTEAA13JQD	0312324790	852391226	The Year's Best Science Fiction: Twenty-First Annual Collection (No. 21)	Books	5	4	7	N	N	More great SF than you can shake a stick at	The annual collection of the best of science fiction edited by Gardner Dozois (until recently, the editor of Asimov's magazine) is always eagerly awaited.  This year's, the 21st edition of it, was of special interest to me, as it has another \\"Company\\" story by Kage Baker.  So I just had to read it.  While I am normally more of a fantasy fan then a science fiction one, I am finding more of an interest in science fiction than I used to have.  This collection, however, looked very imposing.  Twenty-nine stories in all, over 600 pages.  Would I be able to get through it, or would the Baker story be the only thing of interest for me?<br /><br />The fact that I'm reviewing it should tell you that I found it at least acceptable, if not brilliant.  However, I can tell you that I enjoyed almost every story in the book.  Sure, there are some that are better than others (Terry Bisson's story, \\"Dear Abbey,\\" is decent, but not really my cup of tea), but I can't say that any of them didn't deserve to be in the collection.  Surprisingly, there wasn't much of what I would consider \\"hard\\" science fiction, where the story depends more on the science than on the characters, which made the collection even better for me.<br /><br />While there were many strong stories in this collection, I'd have to say that the best ones were Kage Baker's \\"Welcome to Olympus, Mr. Hearst\\", Steven Popkes' \\"The Ice\\", and Paul Di Filippo's \\"And the Dish Ran Away With the Spoon.\\"  As stated earlier, Baker's story is another Company story, this time with the immortals Joseph and Lewis trying to get William Randolph Hearst to agree to do some storage for some of the Company's rescued items.  Joseph has orders to negotiate other things with Hearst that Lewis isn't even aware of, but Hearst drives a hard bargain.  He won't take anything less than the immortality that Joseph and the rest of the Company operatives have.  The problem is, the immortality solution does not work for anybody older than 5 or 6 years old.  In his negotiations, Joseph makes a startling discovery about Hearst that will have far-reaching consequences.  This story is simply a delight, and it's longer than a lot of Baker's shorts.  There's also a sub-plot of a signed Rudolph Valentino script being stolen from Lewis' room, and their efforts to get it back.  With a mixture of real and imagined characters (Greta Garbo and Clark Gable make an appearance, along with Hearst), the characterization and the humour is nothing short of marvelous.  It also adds a bit to the backstory of Baker's universe, including adding another piece to the future that we've only seen snippets of.  I adored this story.<br /><br />\\"The Ice\\" is another winner for Popkes, whose \\"A Fable of Savior and Reptile\\" in Hartwell's Year's Best Fantasy 3 was one of the best of that collection.  In \\"The Ice,\\" we're in the near future, and somebody has successfully cloned hockey player Gordie Howe.  This does not come out until a reporter digs up the truth when the kid is in high school.  The revelation has a horrible effect on the boy's life as he fights to get out of the shadow of his predecessor.  He makes some very strange choices, getting drummed out of hockey and embarking on a journey of discovery that will lead him to love, tragedy, and ultimately back to the first love of his life, hockey.  It's a wonderful story that asks \\"How much of who we are do we owe to our genes?\\" It's also a poignant tale of love and loss.  The ending is simply marvelous, but of course I won't go into that here.  Probably the best scene in the story is when the main character meets the other attempted clone, one that didn't work out quite as well as it did for him.<br /><br />Finally, there is \\"And the Dish Ran Away With the Spoon,\\" which is just thoroughly funny and entertaining.  It's a cautionary tale of what could happen if we make our household, and all of the products inside it, too intelligent.  In the future, everything has a form of intelligence, fromthe clothes on our backs to our cuisinarts and toothbrushes. Unfortunately, a by-product of all this is that they can sometimes join together to make a new form.  Usually, these are harmless.  However, one of these combinations, called a \\"bleb,\\" was responsible for Kaz's parents' deaths.  He's understandably paranoid about them.  So when his girlfriend, Cody, says they should move in together, he's very worried about what blebs will form from the combination of their two households.  While his worries are legitimate, they come true in a way that he could never have imagined.  I laughed out loud a few times when I read this story, such images as two toothbrushes and a bathroom drinking glass running away on its brushy little feet causing me to giggle.  The idea of losing your girlfriend because a bleb treats her better (and this is not a spoiler as it's mentioned in the very first paragraph) is just hilarious and it's interesting to see just how this comes about.<br /><br />All in all, every story in this collection is worth reading at least once. If you're a science fiction fan at all, you owe it to yourself to pick up this collection.  I know there are some of you who just don't do fiction in the short form.  If that is so, then at least pick it up at the library for some of the novellas that are included. Vernor Vinge's \\"The Cookie Monster,\\" just won the Hugo award for Best Novella.  So you know it has to be good.<br /><br />David Roye, from the clothes on our backs to our cuisinarts and toothbrushes.

US	50332419	R2GC0ZG1MP96ID	0563538635	644674686	The Infinity Race (Doctor Who)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Water, water, everywhere...and a universe to save to boot!	Alternate universes always have a strike against them from the very start, especially if it's a universe that's destined to either revert back to the normal universe our heroes inhabit or destined to be destroyed.  Why should we care about these incidental characters that the author is inventing when what happens to them won't really matter that much?  It's even more of a problem in a continuing series, because the \\"universe\\" the main characters inhabit is consistent from book to book, making the alternate universe even more disposable than it normally is.  The Infinity Race is an alternate universe novel.  The events of Time Zero have caused the universes to diverge, so this is not a spoiler.  Messingham has succeeded in making a book with characters that we somewhat care about, though the fact that the main characters keep hammering home the alternate aspect of their location makes it hard at times.  Thus, Messingham manages to squeeze a pretty good book out of the whole concept.<br /><br />The planet Selonart.  A world that's almost all ocean, crystal clear waters shining in the sunlight.  It's also home of the Trans-Global Regatta, which is \\"the ultimate sporting event in the universe!\\"  Multi-stellar corporations from all over the Earth Empire enter sailing ships into this race for interstellar prestige...and lots of money, of course.  But the mysterious Sabbath has his own agenda for the race.  One that may wreak havoc on the timelines.  The water on Selonart has unusual properties of propulsion, but they also have other mysterious properties.  The Selonart colonists seem to be greatly affected by them, so the corporations put them to use on their sailing ships.  But Sabbath has other plans for them.  The Doctor and his companions land on Selonart and must not only stop these plans, but figure out what they are, before it's too late.  For the Doctor, and the rest of the universe.<br /><br />The Infinity Race is told in an unusual format. There is the normal third-person narrative, but there are also alternate journal entries from Anji and Fitz telling their part of the story, with the occasional piece by Bloom, the main Selonart native character.  The Bloom entries are interesting because we see the change that comes over him as events happen.  His entries start out with very broken English, making them a little difficult to read.  They slowly get better as time goes on and things come to a head.  He's also the most interesting character in the entire book, and it's neat to see the transition he goes through.  The other Selonart natives, however, aren't anywhere near as interesting and do more to illustrate Bloom's character than anything else.<br /><br />Anji and Fitz get a lot of characterization through their entries, and it's probably the best these two characters have been written in quite a while.  The entries reflect their personalities perfectly, with Fitz displaying bravado but admitting to himself when he's really scared of what's happening.  Anji starts out lamenting being pulled from her normal life that she had tried to get back to in Time Zero, is never afraid to point out when the Doctor's being a git, and finally comes around as she decides that what they're doing is necessary.  What's most interesting about her sections is when the Doctor asks her to stay behind and talk to the governor and find Fitz.  When she can't do either one, her frustration screams off the page, and her fear when the riots start is almost palpable.  Sometimes the breezy way they write is a little irritating, especially when they get self-referential.  They talk about endless corridors and how the seemingly never-ending \\"capture, escape, capture again\\" sequence happens again.  But overall, these sections were quite good.<br /><br />The Doctor is his normal dynamic self, which is nice to see.  His interactions with Sabbath are wonderful, with both men being well-characterized.  Their dialogue crackles as they argue the merits of their respective positions.  The Doctor is adamant that Sabbath's plan not only can't work, but will destroy everything.  The only unfortunate thing in The Infinity Race is that Sabbath takes on a couple of bad Master habits (the Master is an old enemy of the Doctor's).  He rants and he raves, and he has an ambiguous fate that looks really bad but isn't deadly enough that he won't come back sometime.<br /><br />Other incidental characters are more hit and miss.  The governor is way over the top, and while that may have been intentional, it didn't make him any less annoying.  Some of the other characters are better, but they are perfunctorily killed off, without any real purpose, after they've been around for a while.  Messingham also suffers from the \\"let's introduce a character and give him some character detail just so we can kill him off\\" syndrome.  It's a cheat to wring a little bit more emotion out of the reader, and it annoys the heck out of me.<br /><br />The more I liked some of the characters, though, the more that the constant references to alternate universes annoyed me.  I was beginning to like a couple of them, and I didn't want them not to \\"matter.\\"  My mind wanted to prevent me from investing too much caring into them because they would ultimately disappear, even if they didn't actually \\"die.\\"  That's the sad part of the book.  Ultimately, it was an enjoyable read, and I'm glad I did.  Give it a shot.<br /><br />David Roys of their respective positions.

US	50332419	R1T7MDDBLUVQ0	0743410246	307045695	4: Mission Gamma Book Four: Lesser Evil (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Mission Gamma)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	The Mission Gamma series ends...oh, did it really end?	Robert Simpson's Lesser Evil brings Deep Space Nine's \\"Mission Gamma\\" miniseries to a close, in a sense, but unfortunately it's more like a placeholder for the hardcover Unity then it is a culmination of the story itself.  The book is incredibly short (the previous three books clocked in at over 400 pages while Lesser Evil is a measly 266.  It continues the Bajoran political story and has a minor story that ties the entire Gamma Quadrant story together in a rather perfunctory fashion.  I was mildly disappointed with it.<br /><br />Simpson packs a lot into a very tiny package, and I think it suffers for it a bit.  The Borg storyline feels incredibly simple, and while I enjoyed reading about Vaughn and his daughter's reaction to what they find, it all seemed to end almost as soon as it began.  The situation down on the planet where they find the Borg is over quickly and it seems like it was there only to set up the conclusion of the book that leads into Rising Son.  It's certainly not that interesting by itself.  The only thing that saves this story at all is the strong characterization of Vaughn and finding out more about why he came to Deep Space Nine and the orb vision that sparked his decision.  While we have known that the conflict with his daughter was because of what happened to his wife, we never knew exactly what did happen to her.  That was neat to see.  I just think it called for a bit more story than we actually received.<br /><br />Once again, the Bajoran story is the highlight of the book.  We finally learn the secret behind what's been happening for the last three books, and it's a doozy. Of course, as I've said, I already knew it, but I didn't know the details.  When I discovered them, it was still a bit of a shock.  The sequence where Kira has to try and regain control of the ship is riveting, and it's full of even more twists and turns.  In hindsight, one of the twists is obvious, but I admit that I was fooled.  Unfortunately, the climax of this story (or should I say this part of the story, since it does continue in Unity) reads very much like the concluding scene of the episode that introduced this villain (and I won't say which one as that will, obviously reveal who it is).  It would have been nice to see a little more originality.  Thankfully, Simpson nails Kira's characterization, and he also does a good job with the crew of the Gryphon.  Kira shows the battle smarts that got her through the Occupation when she has to come up with a way to keep the other ships on her side from firing on them.  It makes wonderful use of continuity and it's little dashes like this that give me hope for the Star Trek books.<br /><br />The main problem with the book is that it just seems to be treading water waiting for the first hardcover of the new Deep Space Nine series.  At the end of Cathedral, the whole Joseph Sisko problem was introduced, and this story spends a lot of time with him as he's slowly coming to terms with what's happened to his son and grandson.  It brings back some familiar faces, which is nice, and the story is very sweet.  The characterization of Joseph is great, as is the characterization of the guests.  So while it gave me a pleasurable feeling, I couldn't help the feeling that it was all just included to get Joseph to Deep Space Nine for Unity.<br /><br />Thus, the \\"Mission Gamma\\" series comes to an end, not with a blast, but with a \\"to be continued.\\"  However, the series itself can still be judged, as the Gamma Quadrant portion of the story is over.  Ultimately, I found the Gamma Quadrant stories to be weaker in all four books.  Some of that may be my interest in Bajoran politics taking precedence, but I think part of it is also my feeling that the stories just weren't that substantial.  I realize that the exploration of the Gamma Quadrant was to be more of an exploration of the characters who went on the mission, but does that mean that we couldn't be given any interesting external elements?  The only interesting species were the Yrythny in This Gray Spirit, and we weren't given any good characters within that species to really make us sit up and take notice.<br /><br />The series itself was quite good, just not as good as it could have been, saved by the Bajoran political angle.  Unfortunately, Lesser Evil ends the series on a bit of a fizzle, forcing us to look to the intriguing Unity to bring it out of its doldrums.<br /><br />David RoyThe only interesting species were the Yrythny in This Gray Spirit, and we weren't given any good characters within that species to really make us sit up and take notice. <br /> <br />The series itself was quite good, just not as good as it could have been, saved by the Bajoran political angle.

US	50332419	R2KE46WEWOQUX9	0743445643	576276131	Mission Gamma Book Three: Cathedral (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Mission Gamma) (Bk.3)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Political intrigue at its best	A continuing problem with the Mission Gamma series of Deep Space Nine books has been character angst.  There's just been too much of it.  In Cathedral, Andy Mangels and Michael A. Martin give us a plot that would seem to call for a lot of angst.  Thankfully, they tone it down to a dull roar, thus making the book a lot more bearable.  They've created an interesting mcguffin that gives our characters a lot to deal with, and they do it beautifully.  Add a killer ending that leads into the next book into the mix, and you have a satisfying piece of the Gamma Quadrant puzzle.<br /><br />Once again, the most interesting part of Cathedral takes place on the station.  I'm a sucker for Bajoran politics, and the characters there continue to fascinate.  I'm a big Ro fan, so watching her wrestle with Quark, her feelings about the Federation, her growing attraction to a Trill security operative, and everything else going on around the station was extremely interesting to me.  As I said in my review of This Gray Spirit, what's truly going on in the Bajoran plot had been spoiled for me, but it was still interesting to piece everything together.  I pegged what was going on with Shakaar immediately, but trying to piece together how everybody else fit in was fascinating.  The events in the Andorian plot in This Gray Spirit meant that a lot of my gripes about that book didn't carry over to Cathedral, which I was very happy with.  The Andorians didn't figure much at all, except for Shar's reaction to these events, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />Which brings us to the Gamma Quadrant.  While the events back on the station deeply affected Shar, Mangels and Martin avoid having him wallow in his grief, at least externally.  I could tell that he was heavily affected, but we didn't get pages and pages of him moaning about it.  That's one plus right there.  Secondly, the plot involving the Defiant was finally interesting.  On first glance, it suffers from the same problem that This Gray Spirit had, where we aren't really given any characters to care about other than our heroes.  This time, however, it didn't make that much of a difference.  The two alien species are more a plot obstruction that the Defiant crew have to deal with, rather than having the plot deal with them.  Thus, the interest is in seeing how the crew gets past their obstruction.  One of the aliens is given a little bit of character, but it seems to be more a plot convenience than anything else. He points them in the right direction, and then he gives them some stumbling blocks later on in the story.  I really enjoyed that.<br /><br />This gave us a chance to see how Bashir, Nog, and Ezri dealt with their own situations.  Again, Mangels and Martin avoid the heavy angst that permeated the first two books. This is surprising because if any plot called for angst, this one did.  I loved how Bashir's log slowly degenerated as his genetic augmentation failed.  Ezri's doubts about her abilities as first officer of the Defiant were also well-handled, as was Vaughn's reaction to it.  We finally get some resolution from Ezri's heavy reliance on her previous hosts abilities that I found a bit heavy-handed earlier in the series.  When that ability is stripped from her, it's intriguing to see how she handles it.  The scene where Vaughn convinces her that she is still valuable is wonderful.<br /><br />Even better is Nog, as he has to deal with two things:  the fact that his leg is growing back, and the fact that he is the only one of the three characters who actually had something good happen to him.  His secret desire to keep his good leg runs up against the certainty that none of these things can be reversed if all of them aren't is almost heart-breaking.  The scene where he and Shar share their secrets (Nog's guilt and Shar's tragedy) is well-written.  The only bad thing about the whole Gamma Quadrant plot is the relatively quick resolution.  I realize that the point of the story was how thesecharacters deal with the loss of their abilities, rather than how to solve the problem, I still found that the solution was almost too easy.  Sure, the Defiant had to go through a lot and there was a chance that they couldn't retrieve the three wounded people, but it was too easy for the characters themselves.  Still, that's a small niggle and doesn't detract that greatly.<br /><br />Then we come to the ending.  Whoa, boy!  I had a general idea of what was going on, and I was still floored.  Talk about your cliffhanger!  Thankfully I had the next book right there and could continue immediately. I don't know how I would have been able to wait a whole month to find out what happened.  It takes the Bajor plot in a whole new, satisfying direction.  Kudos to both Martin and Mangels.<br /><br />In fact, many compliments to them for saving what had been a good, but fairly lackluster series.  For once, I wasn't reading the Gamma Quadrant sequences while saying \\"I have to get through these in order to get back to the station.\\"  Both sides held my interest equally.

This Gray Spirit is the first book written by Heather Jarman, which I think is unusual for a Star Trek book.  It has the difficult job of continuing the Defiant's exploration of the Gamma Quadrant and the political machinations that are resulting from Bajor's application to join the Federation.  As such, there's a lot of story to juggle.  While not as big as Twilight, it's still almost 400 packed pages.  For a first effort, it's very good, but there are some real problems with it that I hope she rectifies in her subsequent books.<br /><br />I said in my review of Twilight that the book was full of Vaughn's angst.  Unfortunately, the trend continues in This Gray Spirit, though this time it's Dax's turn.  Dax is a Trill, a species with a humanoid host containing a slug that's been alive for a long time, and Dax has been alive for three hundred years.  Ezri was joined against her will as the only Trill on board when her ship was attacked by the Dominion.  Thus, she's had to assimilate a lot of abilities and memories, and she's still working toward that.  She's forced into an extremely diplomatic situation on the planet and she has to try and use her various Dax personalities to come up with a way out of the current problem.  While it's interesting to see Dax's dilemma, I do have to say that the angst factor was turned up to a high level and got a bit tiring to read about.  It helps that Dax is an interesting character, though.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Dax angst isn't the only angst to deal with.  Ensign ch'Thane's Andorian reproductive problems also take center stage in this book.  Ch'Thane isn't the problem, however.  It's his bondmates back on the station who really started to grate on my nerves.  One of his three bondmates, Thriss, is extremely fragile and very hurt that he went off to the Gamma Quadrant rather than go home to Andor with them.  In fact, occasionally she turns violent, and there is one vivid scene with the security chief, Lieutenant Ro, trying to break up a fight between Thriss and another of her bondmates.  Scenes like this really bring home the dilemma, but there are just too many of them.  They start to become repetitious and boring.  We get the idea that Thriss is despondent over what's going on.  Let's get on with it!  These scenes do introduce us to the new station counselor, Phillipa Matthias.  She is an intriguing character who Ro immediately begins to like (and knowing Ro's feelings about counselors, that's a good thing).  I also really liked her, though it will be nice to get to know her a little better than we get in this book.<br /><br />In addition to the angst, there is the problem of characters.  The regulars are fine.  No, the characters I'm talking about are the Yrythny, the people who Vaughn and his crew are dealing with.  We see the caste system that they have set up, we get an interesting world where these amphibious aliens go back in the water to spawn, with a class of other Yrythny who have no home waters to go to and are thus \\"lesser\\" people.  The problems on this world are fascinating and I loved how the crew of the Defiant interacted with them.  However, there are no real characters for the crew to interact with.  The closest we get to a character is Keran, the Delegate who befriends ch'Thane and is trying to get more rights for her fellow Wanderers.  Other than Keran, we get a bunch of faceless aliens who I couldn't really distinguish between.  When the conspiracy is revealed and the story hits its climax, I didn't really care.  I didn't have anything invested in anybody other than whether or not Dax and ch'Thane succeeded in what they were trying to do.  If you can't get us to care about any of the characters you introduce, then you've lost half the battle of making an enjoyable book.<br /><br />That being said, I loved bits and pieces of the book.  The climax is full of tension and since it involved the entire Defiant crew in different places, the fact that I didn't care about any of the Yrythny didn't bother me.  Plus the events on the station were really intriguing too.  Unfortunately, I've been spoiled about what's happening there, so instead of trying to figure out what was going on, I was trying to figure out how what I knew fit in with what was going on, but it was still satisfying.  So far I'm finding the political problems on Bajor to be much more interesting than the exploration of the Gamma Quadrant, and I'm not sure that's a good thing.  I hope that improves.<br /><br />Jarman is a pretty good writer, and the fact that I ultimately enjoyed This Gray Spirit despite not really caring about the Andorians or the aliens that she created didn't really take away from that.  She did create an intriguing society, and if she ever decides to populate that society with characters I actually want to read about, I'm looking forward to reading that book.  The fact that she does such a great job with the regulars also saves this one.  Give it a try, even if it is just to get to the next book in the series.  It's definitely worth a read.

US	50332419	R1L3RVIAKHLO90	0765304694	759791610	The Dragon's Son (Dragonvarld Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	2	6	9	N	N	Can these characters be this dull?	Margaret Weis is known for her work with dragons, so it's no surprise that her latest trilogy is yet another one about them.  This time, though, she's created her own world and designed her own little dragon society.  The first book, Mistress of Dragons, was an excellent beginning, showing us just enough of the world to intrigue us and populating it with some interesting characters to go along with it.  Granted, the world wasn't explored very thoroughly, but there was just enough there to make us wonder.  However, Dragon's Son continues the few shortfalls that the first book had and gives us a few more, hamstringing the characters and giving us other characters who we don't care about at all.  It's a major step down, but it still looks recoverable for the third book.<br /><br />There are so many things wrong with this book that I'll start with the good stuff to get it out of the way.  Once again Draconas is the most interesting character in the book.  While he does care about humans, and humanity in general, he's not above using people to further his own ends when the circumstances seem to demand it.  He doesn't like it, but he knows it has to be done.  He's harsh with the boys when he needs to be, but the sequence where he brings Marcus out of the shell in which he has encased himself demonstrates that he really does care.<br /><br />That's really about it.  Unfortunately, for the second book in the trilogy, Weis has given us a rather dull book with characters that are difficult to care about.  Some of the characters from the first book aren't used that much at all (criminally, Draconas really doesn't factor into the book that much, and Edward doesn't have a lot to do either) while others almost undergo lobotomies.  Bellona is almost nothing like the warrior she was in the first book.  While her grief over Melisande and the resentment she feels about having been charged to take care of Ven is understandable, she doesn't show any signs of the woman she once was.  Later, we're told that, deep down, she really did love and care for Ven, but we're never shown it, not even when the story is being told from her point of view.<br /><br />Instead, we're given three new characters:  Ven, Marcus, and a daughter of a thief, Evelina.  Ven and Evelina are thoroughly unlikable and Marcus is just dull.  Ven has lived his entire life alone with Bellona, only interacting with people during the annual town fair, and even then he stops going from the age of six to the age of sixteen.  Thus, he is naïve in a lot of ways, and Evelina takes advantage of that.  I saw what was coming between them, and I just didn't care.  In fact, I almost thought \\"good riddance.\\"  I don't know if we were supposed to feel sorry for him or not, but I certainly didn't.  Evelina is completely amoral, looking out for herself at all times.  Yet she inexplicably falls in love almost instantaneously with somebody right at the end of the book.  I don't know what Weis will do with this in the third book, but the startling nature of this threw me completely out of this one.<br /><br />Also, I again didn't really feel like a part of this world that Weis had created.  We get some details on a couple of different fairs that Bellona and Ven go to, and we see the underbelly of another city.  We also see a hidden city but don't really get too much of a view of it.  It just feels like the world is a place for these events to happen, and that's about it.  The religion seems based on Christianity (with God, saints, abbeys, monks and nuns), but we certainly don't get an impression of how this religion affects people's lives.  It's a shame, really, as I know Weis is a capable world-builder.<br /><br />The book ends with a wonderful twist that really does have me looking forward to the third book, but part of that is because it seems that Draconas will be featured a lot more in it than he was in Dragon's Son.  This twist completely turned around my understanding of what was going on, and I loved it.  The book is a very quick read, which helped me get through it despite the dull spots.  It also helped that I had a break in the middle where I discovered that the first copy of the book I had was missing a bunch of pages, and it took me a couple of weeks to track down another copy.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth reading once to continue the story.  I know Weis is capable of better than this, and I have high hopes for the third book in the series.  It would be almost impossible for her to drop the ball as badly as she did this time.<br /><br />David Roys going on, and I loved it.

US	50332419	R3K6G6K6KZ3PG6	0563486066	828253634	The Colony of Lies (Doctor Who)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Not the Old West that we know and love...	The cover and the blurb of Colony of Lies are both semi-misleading, which is a shame.  The cover makes it look like it's a Wild West novel, though the blurb on the back makes that a falsehood.  However, the blurb on the back says that it also stars the 7th Doctor and Ace.  That's true in a sense, but only in the broadest of terms.  They star in the prologue and epilogue, and the 7th Doctor also does his patented \\"behind-the-scenes\\" routine to help the 2nd Doctor out once.  This \\"help,\\" though, pretty much solves the problem once the 2nd Doctor is able to use it, so I guess that means he's pretty important.  It does lead to a nice red herring (well, it fooled me, at least), which is also good.<br /><br />All in all, Colony of Lies is a pretty good book, though it tries a bit too hard to make the 2nd Doctor sound like he does on television.  Usually, this is a good thing, but it does come down a little too hard on the clich&eacute; side of things to be good.  Of course, as Patrick Troughton did on more than one occasion, Brake has the Doctor saying \\"Oh my giddy aunt!\\" when something goes wrong.  It's not too bad, though.<br /><br />Colony of Lies is a lot better than Brake's first Dr. Who book, Escape Velocity.  Sure, the Old West motif doesn't work and falls apart rather quickly, seeming superfluous and wrong-headed.  Yes, the idea of \\"sleepers\\" coming to life and threatening a world is as old as the hills.  Brake manages to put a nice spin on the idea, though, and the revelation of what really happened when the colony was founded is actually quite interesting.  I think others have given this part short shrift, concentrating on the sleepers themselves, but I rather liked it.<br /><br />The Old West routine, however, is dull, dull, dull.  Not only that, it's useless.  First, there's no reason for it.  Ostensibly, Ransom chose this time period as the time of purity, where technology doesn't run humans' lives.  There are mentions of streetlights and other more modern trappings, though.  Even without that little continuity hitch, it all just seems rather pointless, more of an excuse to make some of the characters ride on horses.  The cover just adds to the problem, emphasizing this bit over everything else.  Couldn't they just have shied away from technology in general, rather than picking a specific time period to emulate?  None of the scenes would have changed, other than in the background.  And don't get me started on calling the main family on this colony \\"Kartryte.\\"  I almost wanted to scream.<br /><br />The characterizations are pretty good in Colony of Lies, with a couple of exceptions.  The Doctor, Zoe, and Jamie come to life, though there are some elements taken from the series in there.  I think Brake really captured Troughton's sense of \\"playing it by ear,\\" where he sometimes acted before he thought.  One sequence in particular comes to mind, where he waves a white flag without even thinking if the aliens will understand what it means.  Each of the regulars has a meaty role, though at times they are sidelined for no apparent reason.  Zoe gets short shrift in this area, being incapacitated twice and disappearing for large sections of the middle.  She does have some great scenes at the end, though her last minute rescue turns out not to be needed so I question why it needed to be in there.<br /><br />As for the other characters, the colonists have some good roles, though they are a bit two-dimensional.  This is only bad because some of them are a bit more important to the story than others.  Billy Joe really suffers in this area, as he is a large part of the plot but yet I didn't really feel like I knew him at all.  He's a disillusioned boy who wants to join the Realists, and then changes his mind after seeing how the Realists live.  It didn't make any sense.  The other problems in the characterization department are the Tyrenians.  We have three individuals, but I didn't get much sense of them.  There's a commander, a regular soldier, and a psycho (he didn't wake up correctly).  There isn't much to them, however.  Finally, there's Federation Administrator Greene.  The back cover blurb really talks him up.  The first time we see him, he makes somebody's blood run cold, creating an ominous feeling.  He seems to be the most ruthless one of the bunch.  However, other than badly affecting one character, he doesn't really amount to much.  When I got to the end of the book, I found myself saying \\"So?\\"<br /><br />Finally, a note about the structure of the book.  The book is divided into six \\"episodes,\\" each ending with a cliffhanger.  This is a conceit straight out of the television show.  This works in Colony of Lies because the other chapters do not end in cliffhangers at all, unlike a lot of books.  It really makes this book feel like a television story, and it brought a warm, cozy feeling to this fan.<br /><br />Colony of Lies is not a great book, but it is a very good one.

US	50332419	RDA9I93L9BT3O	0060723831	765265811	Misunderestimated: The President Battles Terrorism, John Kerry, and the Bush Haters	Books	4	29	33	N	N	A look inside the Bush Administration...	Political books are not my forte, especially in these trying times.  Books are coming out from the right and from the left, either excoriating or excessively praising George W. Bush, and there just isn't any middle ground.  After reading Misunderestimated by Bill Sammon, I think I will go back to my shell.  I think that might be why I prefer history to current events.  While history can certainly be politicized, the line usually isn't this distinct.<br /><br />It's not that Misunderestimated is a bad book.  In fact, it's actually quite interesting.  I did learn a few new things, got a new spin on certain old things, and read the last 150 pages in one sitting.  But all the time I was reading it, I kept on thinking \\"I wonder what a Leftist writer would say about this?\\"  I found myself disengaging from it, wondering where some of the analysis was.  There is little analysis, however.  Instead, it portrays Bush in as good a light as possible.  There is one mild criticism of the way post-war Iraq has been handled, but otherwise it's all positive.  Instead, Sammon goes on the attack, against the Press mostly.<br /><br />Misunderestimated begins with a riveting sequence in Portland, Oregon, where Bush's motorcade was assaulted by masses of protesters.  Sammon takes us inside the motorcade and inside the security arrangements, showing us how the protesters were actually able to lay a hand on the limousine as it tried desperately to get behind the barricades and to where Bush was trying to go.  Sammon puts the reader on the scene, and I found it pulse-pounding despite knowing that it ultimately had to turn out all right.  Sammon uses this chapter to show us how ugly political discourse has become in our society, with Bush being the lightning rod.<br /><br />In the second chapter, Sammon gives us a history of Saddam Hussein.  A lot of it I had already known, but some of it I didn't.  It would have been nice to have some documentation in this and other historical chapters, telling us where the information came from.  It would make some of the details a bit more credible, though it is obvious that Hussein was a horrible dictator even without sources.  It's not that I found myself doubting this chapter, but documentation would have given it a lot more power.  Basically, all of the major events up until the book was finished are in here, seen from a behind the scenes camera.  Sammon was given a lot of access to Bush and other Bush Administration figures, such as Rice, Rumsfeld, Powell, Karl Rove, and others.  Thus, he gets their side of the story out.<br /><br />Sammon saves most of his venom for the Press.  He's not afraid to name names, either, as he points out one column or article after another that he feels is completely wrong.  He's also very critical of the White House Press Corps, which he shows to be fixated on issues to be critical of the President, even to the point of constantly hammering ideas that have already been either answered or disproved.  He's especially hard on Dan Rather, devoting an entire chapter to his interview with Saddam Hussein, almost transcribing it and putting in his comments about each part of it.  It's a really effective chapter, and I found my opinion of Rather going down further and further as I read it (it was already fairly low after hearing about it the first time, but I hadn't actually read the interview before).  He shows a Media fixated on Vietnam comparisons and trying desperately to trap Bush and the others into making statements that will put them in a bad light.  In one instance, a reporter tries three times to get Bush to give her an end date for the war, just over a week into it.  Then they all seemed upset when he wouldn't give them one, saying only \\"However long it takes to win.\\"<br /><br />Surprisingly, it's the quieter chapters that are the most interesting.  Sammon devotes a chapter to January 2, 2003, and a hike on Bush's Texas ranch that he took the White House Press Corps on.  He showsthem the beauty of the ranch and it's a nice personal moment, just him and the reporters.  Throughout the entire walk, they don't ask him any questions, saving them for the end.  It's a quiet day and shows a more personal side to the President.  Also neat was the chapter on Bush's Thanksgiving Day trip to Baghdad.  It was interesting to see all of the planning behind it, and how they pulled one over on the entire press corps.  The intricate detail, the extensive planning and the hair-raising closeness of having it all fall apart was the highlight of the book for me.<br /><br />Sammon writes very effectively and the book definitely holds your attention.  Even if you don't agree with Bush and with Sammon, you'll find a lot to like (or at least, enjoy reading).  One fault of the book, however, is the almost personal tone taken by Sammon.  He chastises George Galloway for writing himself so much into his pre-war article on Saddam Hussein, but he does a bit of it himself here.  He talks about the playful way he stood up and blocked the White House cameras during one press conference and the banter that he and Bush shared.  He also calls Rice \\"Condi\\" a few times, which I found really inappropriate for a book like this.<br /><br />However, Misunderestimated is what it is.  If you feel the same way as Sammon, you'll have a lot to agree with.  If you disagree with him, this book won't open your eyes.  If you like political books, this is one of the good ones, no matter what your affiliation.  Just don't expect to change your outlook.<br /><br />David Roys on.

US	50332419	R1TSSJXVHUD3WS	0966189965	850833689	Skytrain to Murder	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Is this better than a skytrain to the mall?	Skytrain to Murder, by Dean Barrett, is a decent noir-like thriller taking place in Bangkok, Thailand.  It doesn't really involve a skytrain, but it does involve a murder, so that's one for two, anyway.  Barrett is known for writing Asian thrillers and Skytrain to Murder is another good example of this.  Unfortunately, Barrett spends too much time giving us the flavour of the city rather than giving us an interesting tale.  Atmosphere is like a spice:  if you use too much of it, you drown the taste.  Add to that a subplot that doesn't really seem to go anywhere and you've got a rather short, yet still padded mystery.<br /><br />Scott Stirling is an ex-CIA agent from the Bangkok bureau, now living there.  Short of money, he's moved into an apartment over a local bar.  He teaches diving and does some detective work on the side.  A beautiful blonde asks him to her apartment, supposedly to request his help, along with a good screw.  When he gets there, she has decided she doesn't need his help anymore, but the screw could still go ahead if he wants.  He respectfully declines, but unfortunately, she later ends up dead.  Investigating the murder leads him through the seedy underside of Bangkok life, reaching all the way to the top of the business world.  He's also asked to rescue a little girl who's supposed to be used as collateral in a loan-shark deal.  In this quest, he's aided by his martial-arts trained girlfriend (Dao) and her family.  It's too bad that she's also a suspect in the murder.<br /><br />The more I think about this book, the more problems I come up with, though I do have to say that I ultimately enjoyed the book.  Barrett throws in a lot of sub-plots, some of them leading to other avenues of investigation and some apparently red herrings (or, for this novel, red pufferfish).  It's unusual to have whole subplots be red herrings, though, and I found that it detracted from the book.  Especially bad is the rescuing of the girl.  After finishing the book, I can see no reason why this was in there, other than giving us a view of his girlfriend's world.  This could be fine, but we get to the spice analogy above.  It overwhelms everything else.  Barrett makes it seem like a big deal, but when he's finished, the only thing it really did was show how tough Dao's brother is.  What's the point?  He also spends a lot of time on Dao's muay-Thai martial arts match, going into heavy detail about it, punch by punch.  If Dao were a major character, I could see the reason for this, but she really doesn't do much in this book.  So why are we spending so much time with her?<br /><br />It's also bad when the narrator draws attention to the many coincidences that permeate a book.  Near the end, Stirling (the book is written in first person) comments on the unlikely string of events that led him to the predicament he was in, and how he got out of it.  I think readers should probably come to that conclusion themselves, and they might be a lot more forgiving about it if they do.  However, the two comments at end of the book (the one about the coincidences and then the one explaining why there's a skytrain in the title of the book) are so heavy-handed and obvious that they almost don't feel like they were written by the same writer.  The rest of the prose in the book is great, reminiscent of a Sam Spade in Asia novel.  It almost felt like I was watching a black and white movie.<br /><br />It's a shame that there are so many structural problems, because Barrett does give us some very interesting characters.  Stirling is a great main character, with a cynical outlook on life yet remaining a pretty positive guy.  I almost picture him with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, ala Bogart.  Barrett also provides us with quirky bit characters and interesting suspects in the murder.  In fact, even Chinaman (Stirling's adopted Chinese brother who adopted that nickname, but only for a select few people to use) is intriguing.  We only get a couple ofglimpses of him when he calls Stirling, but I definitely would love to read a book about him.  The dialogue that Barrett provides for these characters also crackles.  I loved some of the exchanges in the Boots and Saddle bar between the regulars there.  It really added to their character.<br /><br />I didn't let the problems in Skytrain to Murder get to me until after I had finished it and thought about it.  While I was reading it, I really enjoyed the prose, the characters, and the dialogue.  While the plot was a bit contrived and there were too many extraneous sub-plots (especially for a 260 page book!), I was hooked from page one until I got to the end.  If you turn you allow yourself to go with the flow, and if you like your thrillers with a bit of exoticism to them, then give this one a try.  I'll even add an extra star for the enjoyment factor.<br /><br />David Roycouple of glimpses of him when he calls Stirling, but I definitely would love to read a book about him.

US	50332419	R14W81OZF68ZOJ	0553801546	130881552	Fool's Fate (The Tawny Man, Book 3)	Books	5	45	49	N	N	Fitzchivalry comes a long way...and what's with that name?	I've discovered something about Robin Hobb, something that has recoloured my view of Golden Fool.  Hobb writes slow-paced character studies that emphasize that character over the action.  She writes about relationships, and she writes them very effectively.  I still found Golden Fool to be too slow with the character interaction not as interesting as she has shown she is capable of.  However, I now have a bit more of an understanding of it.  That is because I read the third book in the series, Fool's Fate.  This book is more of the same, but I found it much more interesting.  Fitzchivalry Farseer is still going through rough times, but it seems to have more of a point to it than it did in the second book.<br /><br />Fool's Fate seems very unusual in that the \\"climax\\" of the book takes place almost two-thirds of the way through the book, with the rest of it dealing with all the scattered pieces of Fitz's life that Hobb has left and how Fitz attempts to put them back together. This is where I realized what the point of this series was.  It wasn't just the story of a dragon-quest and a political alliance.  It was the story of how far Fitz has come since the events in the first Assassin series, a story of relationships.  The dragon is important, but only in relation to Fitz and Dutiful and the past that Fitz has to face.  The pace of the book is extremely slow, but Hobb's strong writing makes it interesting (unlike the second book, which I think just came across as too depressing to be interesting).  The text is dense and you won't plow through it in a day or two.  That could be a fault if you don't like that sort of thing.  I do, when it's done well, so I loved it.<br /><br />Another strength that Fool's Fate had that Golden Fool didn't have was that it didn't seem as contrived.  Many times in the previous book, Fitz had to be spying a lot so that the reader could understand what was going on.  He was constantly sneaking through the secret passages in the castle so that he could watch, for example, the Bingtown Traders come for an audience with the Queen.  That's a hazard of writing in the first person, and I thought it let Hobb down in the second.  Not this time.  There is a little bit of spying, but not a lot.  Exposition isn't quite as necessary in Fool's Fate, it being much more immediate to Fitz.  He's also directly involved a lot more, so what exposition there is comes more from a character relating the story to Fitz.  In large doses this would be tiresome too, but Hobb minimizes it.<br /><br />All of the characters are extremely interesting and three-dimensional.  The only one who gets short shrift is the villain of the piece.  I realize that's because she isn't that important in the grand scheme of things, but considering how evil she is and some of the things she does, I found the cursory way she was dealt with disappointing.  Her influence is felt more in the surroundings than it is directly by her actions, and this is actually quite effective.  Consider her even, with both a huge plus and a huge minus.  Every other character, however, is far up on the plus scale.<br /><br />The only other character fault is Thick, but it's not because he's badly characterized.  He actually gets a lot of development and is one of the most three-dimensional characters in the bunch.  However, I just found him annoying.  His constant whining about not getting on a boat, constantly being sick, his single-mindedness, all of it was just aggravating.  If he doesn't reach your annoyance threshold, then you will like this book even more then I did.  And I did like it a lot.<br /><br />The relationship between the Fool and Fitz is very touching, a love that goes beyond lovers and even beyond family.  I think that one of the strengths of Fool's Fate was that they weren't at each other's throats so much as they were in the second book.  Their relationship colours everything else in the book, and the book lives or dies on it.  They have their arguments in this one, but you don't feel like the heart has been ripped out of the book.  What happens is almost tragic, and the way the relationship is left feels almost fitting.  It's an ending and a beginning, and they have to decide whether being together will be part of that.<br /><br />Finally, Hobb does a wonderful job with pulling together all of her series.  If you read this series first, you will find out a lot of what happens in the first Assassin series, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  She ties together that series and the Bingtown Traders one into a cohesive whole, using elements of everything to leave the world in a different place than when she started.  She also ends it fairly definitively, so there doesn't appear any chance of a sequel.  This is a good thing, as it would be nice to see her try something new.  I know she has written as Megan Lindholm, but it would be interesting to see where she goes as Robin Hobb.  Here's to another book, but definitely in a different world.  Give the whole series a try, reading the second book with an eye to what I said above.  You'll probably enjoy the second book a lot more than I did, and then you'll have this wonderful conclusion.<br /><br />David Roytheir arguments in this one, but you don't feel like the heart has been ripped out of the book.

US	50332419	R1JLHES5ZXJGT0	0060554800	240754874	Red Tide	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Terrorism hits Seattle, just not like we all thought	After roaming the Midwest in A Blind Eye, G.M. Ford brings his intrepid and nosy reporter, Frank Corso, back to the Pacific Northwest in Red Tide. In this one, Ford tackles international terrorism but in his own, unique way. Ford ignores the stereotypical &quot;Let's make the Arabs the culprits.&quot; Instead, he does something much more interesting, all along commenting on the state of affairs in today's United States. He reminds us that horrible things have happened in other parts of the world, and maybe one of those will come back and bite us as just as Middle East policy has. The book is extremely tight and well-plotted, with twists and turns that will make your head spin. The ending, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I don't mean the ending of the story, but the ending of the book itself.<br /><br /> The book starts at the photo exhibition of Meg Dougherty, sometimes lover of Frank Corso. It's going extremely well, but it's interrupted by the police coming in and saying that everyone has to evacuate. They won't say why, which is Frank's signal to stick his nose into the situation. He discovers that somebody has released a deadly disease in a Seattle bus tunnel, killing over 100 people. Meanwhile, Meg heads home but stumbles upon a man from her past. She follows him, loses him, but then finds him again, dead on her kitchen floor. Are these two occurrences linked? Who would do something so horrible to the citizens of Seattle? And worse, will they strike again? Corso, Dougherty, and the Seattle police race to find out what happened, constantly interrupted by the Feds, who have their own agenda and thoughts on the situation, as they usually do.<br /><br /> Red Tide benefits from using the current political climate to add a lot of tension to an already interesting plot. At first, I thought Ford was making his political point much too blatantly, with the Feds coming in and trying to use the Patriot Act to intimidate everybody. The message is a bit strong, but I realized that this is what the Feds in these books always do, just more so. They always butt into the situation like they know everything and the hero has to avoid them and solve the crime despite them. Sometimes they help at the end, sometimes they don't. In this case, they just serve to get in the way. Corso makes some comments against the war in Iraq, especially referencing weapons of mass destruction, but much of that can be attributed to the fact that Corso is a pretty liberal guy anyway.<br /><br /> When you look at the situation like that, it becomes a lot more bearable. The rest of the book is extremely interesting. It's also very tight, taking place over two days, except the last few pages. It's nice to see that, for once, Corso isn't on the outs with everybody, and the cooperation between Corso and the cops was a great change of pace. The description of the victims of the disease is horrifying, even more so when you see the reactions of the experts to the situation. The plot is intricate and red herrings abound. This is actually tough considering, for the first time I can remember in a Corso novel, Ford actually presents us with the viewpoint of the villain(s). Anybody with a good memory of the last twenty to thirty years will be able to guess what's going on before Ford actually reveals it, but that's not a bad thing. Even better, when you do figure it out you still won't know exactly what's going to be done about it.<br /><br /> As always, the characterization is what really makes the book. Ford presents us with a lot of them, some more fleshed out then others. Usually, Dougherty and Corso are the only ones with a lot of meat to them, but Ford gives us three cops who are vividly drawn, as well as a few others (some of whom may be villains). He gives us a lot of information on the police chief, making him three-dimensional, as he does with the cops who go around with Corso and Dougherty. Corso is a winner too, and Dougherty has a lot done with her. My onlydisappointment was that Dougherty disappears about two-thirds of the way through the book.<br /><br /> Then, there's the ending. Once everything is settled, Ford does something with Dougherty that I really hate. I don't know what Ford plans for the next Corso novel (and the cover jacket says that he's writing it, so it looks like he's not abandoning Corso as he did Leo Waterman), but it better resolve this issue with Dougherty. Otherwise, it's exactly what happened with the last Waterman book, and it annoyed me then, too. The ending of the story drags a little too, but it's more understandable as we have to wait along with the characters to know exactly how things are going to settle and how many deaths there will be at the end. It's interesting, but it's slow.<br /><br /> Overall, Red Tide is another winning Frank Corso book from a wonderful Seattle author. It's neat to see all the familiar Seattle landmarks, and it adds to the tension when all of this is happening to a city that you love. It's still well worth a read. Just don't let the ending get you down.<br /><br /> David Royher.

US	50332419	R24YPM5HH7KJ3N	0306813262	228807123	The Boston Driver's Handbook: Wild in the Streets--The Almost Post Big Dig Edition	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Getting around Boston can be a hairy business	Driving in Vancouver can be a dicey affair, as many of the drivers here are very strange and don't appear to know what they're doing. It annoys my wife even more than it does me. When my wife and I were looking over a list of books to review, The Boston Driver's Handbook: The Almost Post Big Dig Edition jumped out at my wife. &quot;That should be funny,&quot; she said. So I asked for it. Does it live up to its promise? One thing I do know. After reading this book, driving in Boston sounds even worse than driving here. And that takes some doing!<br /><br /> First, to explain the title (though readers in Boston will already be familiar with this). &quot;The Big Dig&quot; is a massive construction project that is intended to make the main artery of traffic through Boston go underground. It's been very expensive and it's tied up traffic since 1991. However, it's almost over. It's scheduled to be finished in 2005, which is why this is the &quot;Almost Post Big Dig&quot; edition. The authors, Ira Gershkoff and Richard Trachtman, wrote an earlier edition of this book which didn't include this information, though since it was written in 1994, I'm sure it had some information about the current state of construction at the time.<br /><br /> The book starts with a basic overview of driving in Boston. It tells us about the philosophy (&quot;Commandment Number 1: Thou shalt reach thy destination as quickly as possible. Everyone and everything else be damned.&quot;). It talks about what kind of car you should drive. A sparkling new car is just an invitation to be hit, or at least bumped. The best kind of car is an old, beat-up car that already has plenty of bumps and paint scrapes. The authors then go into the street layout of Boston and how confusing it is. They say that there is no way that you can navigate by street signs. The streets twist and turn and confusing one-ways abound. The cool thing about this chapter is that they talk about every section of Boston, detailing the different traffic and parking problems that they present, like how street fairs in the North End can play havoc with basic navigation, sometimes absorbing drivers who are invited to join the fair and then never seen again. This was an extremely interesting section, especially for somebody who's completely unfamiliar with Boston. It may be even more so for the experienced Boston driver, forcing a nod of the head and an &quot;amen, brothers!&quot;<br /><br /> The third chapter is about the Big Dig, with the authors explaining just what is planned, what has happened so far, and what will happen once construction is complete. They tell how the Ted Williams tunnel is currently (or at least at the time of this book's writing) quite beautiful and relatively empty, but as people get wind of it, traffic patterns will adjust and it will become just as dirty and polluted as the other tunnels. One thing that just sounds horrifying is how the new Central Artery will only have three exits, while the old one had 27. I don't even have to live there to find that idea frightening. You don't have to be familiar with Boston to find this chapter interesting as an example of the lofty goals of major construction and how the reality of it usually doesn't quite fit. Again, the authors are quite detailed in telling how the construction has affected things, and they don't avoid giving the positives as well as the negatives here. They're just cynical, not unfair.<br /><br /> The rest of the book is full of the basic and more advanced maneuvers that the expert Boston Driver has to learn. There's the basic cut-off, where you cut in front of the car next to you in order to pass the car in front. There's the sidesqueeze, where you ease into the other lane until the car next to you brakes to avoid hitting you. You then cut them off and go on your way.<br /><br /> The authors also tell about entering the endless traffic circles, really confusing left turns (one of the diagrams in the book is an intersection where you're actually going into the oncoming lanes in order to actually make it through the intersection before the light turns), parking, and many others. Some of the information would be useful here in Vancouver as well as any other cities where traffic is a nightmare. However, a large part of the book is based on Boston Driving culture, such as going the wrong way on a one-way street being the only way to get to some places. Thus, it's funny to read about, but don't try this at home. I especially enjoy the suggestion that parking and driving on sidewalks is sometimes necessary, as long as you look out for pedestrians.<br /><br /> The book is written in an easy style that is entertaining and won't take you too long to read. It's also a short book, which helps as well. I found the information on Boston and its environs to be fascinating, and it almost makes me want to go there, though there's no way I'd want to drive there after reading this book. There's no way I'd survive! The book is marred only by the final chapter (before the final exam), which gives there ideas for how Boston Driving will evolve in the next 100 years. It tries hard to be funny, but usually falls flat.<br /><br /> If you're planning a trip to Boston or planning to move there, this book could prove invaluable. Even if you're not, it's a funny look at driving in the wild streets of a city, and it just may make you appreciate your local traffic a little bit more. Either way, it's a fun read.<br /><br /> David Roybook is an intersection where you're actually going into the oncoming lanes in order to actually make it through the intersection before the light turns), parking, and many others.

Did you know that over 133,000 people every year are injured by doors? How about the fact that over 400,000 people in the United States suffer injuries every year while relaxing or sleeping in bed? You can find out this, and other wonderful information, in Laura Lee's 100 Most Dangerous Things in Everyday Life and What You Can Do About Them. This is a book that straddles two worlds. Unfortunately, it has problems in each one, but it's still an interesting read. It's supposed to be a humor book. How do I know this? It says right on the back that the classification of this book is &quot;humor.&quot; It also contains a lot of information about possible dangers in everyday life and how you can prevent yourself from becoming yet another statistic.<br /><br /> One of the problems with the book is humor. It's just not that funny. There are some humorous quips (I particularly liked the suggestion in the &quot;money&quot; section, where she says that you should get rid of all your cash immediately by sending it to her). I smiled a few times. Even some of the entries are slightly amusing (there's an entry for Finland because they have the highest accident rate in the western world). But as a humor book, it just doesn't really work that much.<br /><br /> The good thing is that the book is valuable in other ways, too. The idea of the book is not to induce general paranoia about everyday living. What, you're going to stay in bed? See the statistic above. No, the book is intended to lessen that paranoia.<br /><br /> &quot;If you can look such deadly items as kitchen knives, bedding, vegetables and teddy bears in the face each day without fear, you should be able to stare down the much more statistically unlikely threats that now haunt our collective consciousness.&quot; pg. 9<br /><br /> Lee presents each item in a very interesting fashion, giving statistics about the number of injuries and/or deaths every year. She briefly describes each entry, then gives a quick wrap-up of things you can do to avoid these injuries. Sometimes the beginning of the &quot;what you can do&quot; section is humorous (for Finland, the first thing she says is that you could avoid going there, but then you'd miss out on a lot of beauty). However, she always does come back to some concrete suggestions, such as avoiding enjoying Finland's wonders while overindulging.<br /><br /> Even when the entry itself may seem odd (&quot;cute guys?&quot;), the information she presents is intriguing. In the &quot;cute guys&quot; section, she talks about how studies have shown how attractiveness can affect our perceptions, such as how 57 percent of male defendants who were considered &quot;attractive&quot; in rape cases were convicted, but 82 percent of those deemed &quot;unattractive&quot; were. The book was definitely worth reading for interesting factoids like this.<br /><br /> The problem is in the presentation of some of these facts. The comparisons she uses don't work when you actually think about them. Take this one, for instance. In the section on sewing, she recounts how more people are injured sewing then are injured while mountain-climbing. According to her, 4056 people are injured mountain-climbing while 7099 are injured sewing. What she doesn't take into account is the fact that, I would guess, there are many more people sewing than climbing mountains. Statistics like this should really be given as percentages rather than straight numbers. Of course, those percentages may not be available, which just means that the comparison shouldn't even be used. She does this constantly, though there are entries where percentages are used. What's worse, she uses these statistics and then states that you are statistically more likely to be injured doing the one activity over the other. That's simply not true with the information she's given us. If 100 mountain climbers are injured but there are only 500 mountain climbers, and 1000 sewers are injured but there are 30,000 of them, youwouldn't say that you're more likely to be injured sewing, would you? Just because 900 more people are injured sewing than climbing mountains? This statistical problem does not affect every entry, thankfully. At times, she just presents the stats and doesn't try to analyze them.<br /><br /> Even the ones that do have this problem contain good information on the potential hazards, including one that I had not only never known, but realized after I read it that I had been using it dangerously and thus have changed my habit. 100 Most Dangerous Things in Everyday Life is a very valuable book that can educate as well as make you rethink your irrational fear of other things, like plane crashes. It's an enjoyable, easy read that is well worth your time. Just give some of the statistics analysis (the statistics are fine by themselves) a hefty dose of salt. And don't expect to laugh uproariously.<br /><br /> David Roy30,000 of them, you wouldn't say that you're more likely to be injured sewing, would you?

Despite the fact that I don't really care for contemporary spy novels, World War II thrillers are my favourite brand of fiction after fantasy/SF. They give me a satisfying dose of real-world action that brings me back down to Earth after the strange worlds that fantasy can bring. This may be because the Nazis make such cool villains (despite what Steven Spielberg says about not using them anymore). Which brings us to Jeffery Deaver's Garden of Beasts, the latest entry in the genre. Garden of Beasts is an immensely satisfying tale that blends intrigue, intelligence, and just that little bit of nastiness into a great treat.<br /><br />Paul Schumann is a thug, but he's a noble thug. He's a war hero from World War I, a boxer and a man who only kills the \\"right\\" people. He's part of the underworld, but only as a man who wants to clean the dregs out from that world. On a hit, he's cornered by the Feds but is offered a unique choice. Go to jail, or do a mission for them that will expunge his record and allow him to start over. All he has to do is go to Germany and kill Reinhardt Ernst, the architect of German rearmament. Endorsed by a senator and financed by a millionaire, Schumann heads off to Berlin with the American Olympic team, masquerading as a sports reporter. Things quickly fall of the rails, though, as Paul has to be saved by his Berlin contact by shooting the man accosting him. This murder draws one of the best detectives in Berlin, Willi Kohl, into the case. Forced to improvise from the outset with a snarling dog of a detective on his heels, Paul has to navigate the rocky rapids of love, betrayal, and bad luck in order to accomplish his mission. On the way, he'll discover just how sick the Nazis are, as will other Germans who get in his way. Will he accomplish his mission, or allow his heart to get in the way?<br /><br />Taking place in 1936, on the eve of the Berlin Olympics, the world did not yet know the horrors of Nazism. Some Americans, in fact, thought they should side with the Germans in any upcoming war. Deaver does a wonderful job of setting the scene, showing us Germans from all sides: some horrified by what their Germany has become, and some beholden to Hitler and his ideals. Some just take advantage of the situation to line their own pockets. There's the Brownshirt leader who Schumann beats up defending a pair of elderly Jews, who is suitably haughty yet is a coward when somebody stands up to him, hiding the truth behind his assault when Kohl questions him about it. There's the person who denounces the Fischer brothers showing how even the most upright-seeming citizens can fall under Hitler's spell.<br /><br />Deaver goes very deeply into the characterization of Schumann, Kohl, and Ernst, giving us three viewpoints that show us different perspectives behind the Nazi ideal. Ernst starts out the novel looking vaguely sympathetic, constantly fighting Goring and Goebbels to make sure he's able to maintain his position. He's doing an experiment that starts off sounding quite benign, but then takes a nasty turn. Ernst is one of Deaver's failures, however, not so much because I didn't like him as a character. Instead, what makes him fail is the roller-coaster ride of his emotions at the end of the book, before the climax. He does two about-faces in the span of three pages, which I found very hard to believe.<br /><br />Kohl, on the other hand, is wonderful, if predictable. He's the intrepid detective whose duty is to the truth, not to the Nazis. He's trying to solve three murders, one of which involves Paul. He's quite intelligent, piecing together clues and staying just a step or two behind Paul. However, he makes mistakes just like any other man would, making him human. He has nothing but contempt for the Nazis, but knows he can't do anything about it. His involvement in the plot, as well as his ultimate fate, is quite obvious, especially as the story moves forward. I liked reading about him, though, which made thepredictability excusable for me.<br /><br />Schumann, for being the protagonist, I found to be fairly mundane. He does have some interesting moments, such as when he has to choose between his target and his conscience, but ultimately I didn't find him that interesting. Good enough to keep me reading, but not good enough to really captivate me. I found his relationship with Kathe to be way too sudden, but otherwise there really wasn't anything wrong with him. He just didn't grab me.<br /><br />The plot, however, did. There are a couple of twists that I did not see coming and I had to put the book down in shock when I got to them. In novels like this, inevitably the plot goes awry and the main character has to improvise. That does happen here, but in ways that surprised me. The final meeting does seem a little choreographed, but not enough to make a major dent in my enjoyment. The finale is quite good, and the results of what happens are quite interesting. Some of the ending is predictable (as I said about Kohl above), but some of it does surprise. The good thing is that, thinking back to events earlier in the book, the ending makes sense, so it is possible to see it coming if you're good.<br /><br />The plot is jammed with intrigue and interesting characters, the hallmarks of books in this genre. We learn yet again that Nazis are not good people (a bit cliche, but still can be done in interesting ways). Put it all together and you've got a great book that will keep you reading into the night.<br /><br />David Royfor me.      Schumann, for being the protagonist, I found to be fairly mundane.

Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer's Year's Best SF 9 because of Kage Baker's story, imagine my horror when I discovered that, for the first time since Book 1 of their Year's Best Fantasy series, there would not be a Baker story in this year's edition.  I decided to soldier on, however, as the other stories have always been exceptional.  I would just have to read a book that did not contain a Baker story.  *shudder*<br />Now, all kidding aside (I love Baker, but I'm definitely exaggerating above), the stories in Year's Best Fantasy 4 did not grip me like they have in past years.  In fact, going back and writing out the story titles and authors for the list below, I'm having trouble remembering what a few of them are about.  Some are charming in their own way, but didn't excite me.  Others left me with disturbing images (and not the pleasurably disturbing ones that good horror novels leave).  &quot;Catskin,&quot; by Kelly Link, is about a witch's son and the cat that has become the dead witch's revenge.  The cat creates a cat suit for the boy out of the skin of all the other dead cats that the witch had taken care of, and they go out to avenge the witch, dealing with the other witch who poisoned her.  Not my cup of tea.  Even the mostly reliable Michael Swanwick's story isn't up to his usual standard, though it is mildly entertaining.  &quot;King Dragon&quot; is about a world of elves and dragons, but this world is brutally technological.  The dragons are intelligent, but they are also mechanical constructs.  In an attack on a village, one of the dragons crash-lands, demands that the village cater to him in order to eventually fix him, and takes a boy to be his eyes, ears, and feet.  The boy becomes very powerful in the village, a resistance group forms and the boy has to eventually decide whether he likes the power he has (despite the horror of his master) or if he is loyal to his village.  It's an interesting story, but I found I didn't really like the atmosphere that much.<br />So what's good about Year's Best Fantasy 4?  There are three really good ones.  &quot;Basement Magic,&quot; by Ellen Klages, is about a young girl with a horrible stepmother, and a maid who knows just a little bit of that voodoo that you do so well.  She quickly befriends the girl and, after seeing how the stepmother treats the girl, decides to help protect the girl with a couple of spells.  The girl takes things just a little too far, however.  This tale was very sweet, but not too sweet.  The characters are interesting and I just loved the friendship that grew between these two people.  The ending is actually quite surprising, and sad in a way.  I loved it.<br />Another good one is &quot;Dragon's Gate,&quot; by Pat Murphy.  In this one, a girl tells a story of the ice women in a bar near the glacier.  They are upset and her mother goes into a coma-like state.  The girl must travel up the mountain pass and get some blood from the dragon there, the dragon that has killed every expedition that has gone after it.  Upon getting there, the girl finds things a lot different then she expected.  The story has a nice twist to it, with the dragon being a credible character in its own right.  The little bit of history of the area is interesting, also tying directly into the outcome of the story, which is nice too.  Excellent stuff.<br />Finally (both in this review and the book itself), there is &quot;Almost Home,&quot; by Terry Bisson.  This story is a voyage of discovery and the beginning of a new life.  Troy and Bug are two boys who enjoy fishing in &quot;Scum Lake,&quot; a big pond that's out by the old horse track.  Troy discovers that various aspects of the track (the announcers' booth and other bits) are beginning to form what looks like an aeroplane (you know, one of those older types).  When it finally forms, they are able to take Troy's deformed cousin for a ride.  They discover, past the seemingly endless desert, a community that is almost, but not quite, exactly like theirs.  The story only contains these three characters, and Bisson captures the wonder and the fear of kids going on an exploration of the unknown vividly.  It's kind of sad, but contains an uplifting ending.  It's also quite imaginative, with this plane being powered by electrolytes from soda pop.  This was an excellent ending for the book.<br />Very few of the stories in Year's Best Fantasy 4 left me cold.  There's &quot;Catskin&quot; as mentioned above, but also Neil Gaiman's story (&quot;Closing Time&quot;) also did.  Perhaps this is because I'm getting tired of the motif of people within the story telling a weird story themselves.  It's starting to get a bit old, and since the story that was being told didn't inspire me, it just sort of fell flat.  Others were ok, but nothing special.  Surprisingly, Tanith Lee's story (&quot;Moonblind&quot;) was one that I actually enjoyed, which just may indicate that my feelings about a Year's Best Fantasy book may be inversely proportional to how much I like Lee's story.  The past two books have contained Lee stories that I didn't like, and I liked those volumes a lot better than this one.<br />Still, my disappointment with this year's edition does not mean it's not worth picking up.  It's still a great collection, just not as good as past years'.  If you're a short fantasy fan (as in a fan of short fantasy, not meaning a height-challenged fan), I would definitely recommend that you pick this book up.  Just make sure you pick up the first three as well.  There's some good stuff there.<br />David Royity that is almost, but not quite, exactly like theirs.

US	50332419	R1TM8G086XZBUE	0765309866	944061381	Medalon: Book One of the Hythrun Chronicles	Books	4	19	19	N	N	From first daughter to demon child in one easy step	It's not often that a new writer explodes on the scene with book after wonderful book that just takes your breath away.  Of course, it helps when the author in question has been writing for a few years in another country and her books are just now coming to North American shores.  Such is the case of Jennifer Fallon, who's Second Sons trilogy has just been published in its entirety in North America.  Also, the first book of the Hythrun Chronicles has also been published, Medalon.  Unfortunately for me, Tor has decided that they don't want to saturate the market and will thus be publishing them once a year.  It will be a while before we're caught up.  I loved the Second Sons trilogy so much that I had to read Medalon, which is actually the first book that she had written.  How does it measure up?  Not quite as good as the Second Sons trilogy, but much better than other first novels.<br />The Sisterhood of the Blade rules Medalon ruthlessly, stamping out any hint of heathen beliefs.  With the First Sister having just been assassinated, Joyhinia thinks that she's going to be named head of the church.  When that doesn't happen, she works a scheme to make it happen.  Her daughter R'Shiel and her son Tarja get caught up in it, and find themselves on the run.  They fall in with a rebellion against the Sisterhood, and end up even deeper into a massive change that will befall the world.  Brak, a Harshini outcast, brings news that the Harshini, long thought dead, may be coming back.  And worse, R'Shiel may be the Demon Child that has been foretold.  War may be coming to the world, religious or political, with R'shiel and Tarja caught in the middle.<br />Fallon has created yet another fascinating world, with the various politics and religions thought out and explained.  There's Medalon with the Sisterhood, the Hythrun who believe in all of the gods, and Karien, where the War God is the only God, and worshipers of all others must fall to the sword.  The Harshini, long thought wiped out, commune with the gods and even have some power (at least of persuasion) over them.  The world these people live on seems so real and the events of the novel follow logically.<br />Fallon does wonderful work with the characters as well, with almost all of them being perfectly three-dimensional.  R'Shiel and Tarja are especially good protagonists, with R'Shiel understandably having trouble accepting her parentage, especially considering her upbringing as the daughter of an ambitious Sister.  Tarja has been exiled and is brought back at R'Shiel's insistence (though Joyhinia fought it every step of the way).  He's a great military leader and an extremely intelligent man.  I did find that R'Shiel's attitude during Tarja and her's initial flight from the capital to be a little bit grating and shrill.  She seemed just a little too haughty, but she did mellow a bit as the story went on.  Jenga, the captain of the Defenders, is also quite well done, considering he doesn't have a major role (at least not in the first book).  Joyhinia has him under her thumb because she knows the truth about Jenga's brother and is quite willing to reveal it if Jenga moves against her.<br />The gods are great characters, too.  The goddess of love (I won't name them because some of them travel in disguise and thus naming them would be spoilers) adds complications as she casts a spell on R'Shiel and Tarja that can only make matters worse.  The god of thieves is mischievous but can help matters if Brak manipulates him well enough.  All of the gods have just a little touch of dimension that makes them stand out, and they are never boring.<br />Sadly, the only character who doesn't quite work is Joyhinia.  Being the main villain of the piece, that's a let-down, but she is just this side of two-dimensional. She's the typical power-hungry woman who won't let anything stand in her way.  She's ruthless, willing to torch a whole village to keep a secret safe.  She rants and she raves and she really isn't that interesting.  If Jenga and his other Defenders weren't so beholden to their honour and their oaths, it would be a wonder that they would obey her at all, as she is quite clearly out for her own power at the expense of the Sisterhood and its Defenders.<br />Whether it's the lack of a credible villain or perhaps the quality of writing, Medalon didn't grip me like the Second Sons trilogy did.  Perhaps that's the fault of the book being Fallon's first, but I didn't have the incredible urge to finish that I did with the other series.  Don't get me wrong, the prose is very good and I found the situation interesting.  I just didn't think it was as interesting as it could be.  The prose isn't quite as polished.  Still, for a first book it is quite good and shows flashes of brilliance at times and definitely indicates Fallon's potential.  I wonder if perhaps my thoughts on Medalon have been influenced a little by reading her subsequent work first?<br />Whatever way it is, I can thoroughly recommend Medalon, and I can't wait for the next book to come out.<br />David Royally isn't that interesting.

US	50332419	R2MW735R4UB3Q7	056353866X	128664368	Time Zero (Doctor Who)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Who on Ice	Justin Richards is the editor of the Doctor Who line of books, so it's only fitting that he get the occasional &quot;big&quot; book rather then just doing fill-ins when an author misses a deadline.  He can always be relied upon to give us an interesting story, often compelling and never boring.  Time Zero is one of the big ones, though not as big as everybody thought it would be.  It doesn't really end the Doctor-Sabbath war of ideas concerning how the timestream will ultimately work, instead blowing everything up and forcing the Doctor to try and pick up the pieces over the next few books.  Time Zero keeps moving at a steady pace, gripping the reader, but then it hits a patch of ice.  Still a very good book, though.<br />After the events of Camera Obscura, Fitz has decided to join an expedition to frozen Siberia in the 1890s and Anji just wants to go home.  The Doctor is alone again, but things are already set in motion to link him with his companions yet again.  Fitz's expedition was attacked by dinosaurs from a history that never happened, and the Doctor has Fitz's journal to prove it.  The journal also indicates that Fitz never returned.  Anji's back working the financial markets, but gets co-opted into joining an American expedition to Siberia that has unknown purposes, though it involves the Naryshkin Institute.  The Institute ostensibly is trying to create a black hole, but why?  And what do the Americans want with it?  Are all these events linked?  The Doctor seems to think so.  He's the only one who does, and his arrival on the scene could be the catalyst that destroys the world, or at least the past.  Repercussions could stretch back to the beginning of the universe.  Or even farther.<br />Richards manages to tie all of these events together expertly, leaving each plot line to move on to the next one just when it's getting good.  The suspense was killing me at a few points, when Fitz was endangered by the dinosaurs or it looked like Anji might get killed.  This had the classic feeling of a &quot;companion leaving&quot; story, and I wouldn't have put it past Richards to kill one of the companions in their final book, so the sense of danger was palpable.  Only the Doctor seemed safe, as it's obviously his series.  Richards also keeps the reader guessing on how everything ties together, with only Siberia visibly linking everything at first.  It's definitely a high-concept book, with alternate realities, time experiments, black holes, and an examination of the universe and how it functions.  But Richards also grounds this in some believable characters and modern-day action, including two Special Forces units.<br />The characters are what make the book great.  The Doctor, Anji, and Fitz are simply wonderful, with the Doctor being at his frenetic best.  He's on top of things, he's a force of nature at times, almost child-like at others, but always the moral center that everything revolves around.  He's calm when everything around him is hysterical and he's intelligent as well.  Gone are the days when he would do something truly stupid and naïve, the &quot;congenital idiot&quot; that some fans labeled him.  Anji and Fitz are just as good, each leading their own scenes, taking charge (figuratively, if not literally) and displaying the attributes that we've always loved about them.  While this is the Doctor's book, they aren't sidelined like they are in Camera Obscura.  They are an integral part of the plot.  While Anji doesn't get to actually do a whole lot, she gives us a viewpoint into Hartford's team and what they're doing, and she shows quick flashes of brilliance even as she's horrified by what Hartford is doing.<br />Most of the other characters are quite good as well, though I thought Hartford was a little too over the top in his ruthlessness and I didn't quite buy his transformation at the end.  It does give a new look at his previous actions, but I don't think it actually worked.  Hartford and his group are chilling and work wonderfully, but Fitz's expedition members are given just enough characterization to make them mildly interesting, but the bits before the expedition reaches the castle dragged a bit because I just didn't care that much about them.  Things picked up once the dinosaurs got involved, though.<br />So the book is moving along very nicely, I'm contemplating taking a longer lunch at work because I want to finish this fascinating novel.  The Institute is rigged to explode and there's a countdown and everything. Then Richards steps on a technobabble landmine, all of a sudden trying to explain all the concepts that he's been examining.  Revelations of who's who and who's been pretending to be who come fast and furious, and the book comes to a screeching halt.  I put the book down and went back to work, eager to finish it but not driven to like I had been.  The tension burst out of the book like a balloon.  Don't get me wrong, Richards quickly recovers from it and the climax is just as exciting and thought-provoking as the rest of the book, but there's a brick wall right in the middle there that just brought everything rudely to a halt.  It's the only real problem in an otherwise wonderful book.<br />Don't let that stop you, though.

US	50332419	R1CSB9578BVBXF	006057559X	800320842	Year's Best SF 9	Books	4	15	17	N	N	Another year, more great stories	One of these days, Kage Baker is going to get me into trouble.  Not personally, of course (having never had the honour of meeting the lady), but her stories.  See, the problem is that I'm such a big fan of hers that I now have to track down every thing she has written and at least read it.  I happened upon this year's edition of Year's Best SF, the ninth, and saw that she had a story in it.  Of course, this meant I had to buy it.  However, doing this leaves me at the mercy of the rest of the stories.  I'm not a big fan of hard SF stories, and I prefer fantasy to science fiction in any case.  Will I have paid a lot of money (especially with Canadian prices) for a book that I only like 20 pages out of 500?  Would this be the time that she's cost me more money then I want to spend?<br />Thankfully, no.  While I didn't care for every story in Year's Best SF 9, I did like them well enough to thoroughly recommend the book.  At 500 pages, there's a lot of stories in here, varying from hard science fiction to near-future character-driven stories, and everything in between.  While Baker's story, &quot;A Night on the Barbary Coast,&quot; is among the best stories in the collection, I would have to say that the best is actually John Varley's &quot;In Fading Suns and Dying Moons.&quot;<br />Baker's story is another in the continuing adventures of The Company, where a bunch of immortal cyborgs try to make money for the time-traveling Dr. Zeus Corporation by harvesting soon to be extinct species of plants and animals, as well as other rare items that will eventually disappear.  In this story, Joseph needs the botanist Mendoza to help him identify a rare fungus related to a quartz deposit that the Company wants in California.  Their personal relationship has always been rocky, ever since Joseph forced her to sit and watch her English lover be burned at the stake, rather than intervene, in the 1550s.  The story takes a nice twist at the end, but as ever Baker's strength is in the characterization, and the banter between the two protagonists.  Mendoza is as anti-social as ever and Joseph is just as witty as he always is.  It made me even more anxious for the next installment of the Company books.<br />Varley's &quot;In Fading Suns and Dying Moons&quot; is the story of an unstoppable line of alien beings, humanoid and apparently holding hands, are sweeping across the country, and ultimately, the planet.  They are harvesting the world's butterflies for some unknown reason.  Dr. Richard Lewis, an insect expert, is called upon to see if he can figure out why they are doing this.  Slowly, with the help of other people (including a mathematical specialist), what these aliens are doing dawns on them, with possibly horrific consequences.  I found this story fascinating, with the alien scourge being very mysterious and intriguing.  There were a couple moments where I laughed, but the ending left me very cold, but in a good way.  I even shivered.  Now *that's* getting the reader involved in the story!<br />There are definitely some other good ones too.  There's Allen M. Steele's &quot;The Madwoman of Shuttlefield,&quot; the story of a musician befriending an old hermit in a run-down section of a far-off colony world where the original colonists aren't too happy with the influx of new people.  There's also &quot;The Waters of Meribah&quot; by Tony Ballantyne, which involves the creation of an alien species by turning a rapist into one.  The end result isn't quite what the scientists expected.  Finally, there's &quot;Night of Time,&quot; by Robert Reed.  This is a story of a man whose job it is to restore memories, and how an alien known for remembering everything has come to him because he has forgotten one small item.  The character work in this story is great, with special kudos for the alien's assistant, whose earliest memories appear to be of food and feasts.  As with most of these stories, there's a nice twist near the end to lead the reader down adifferent path then expected.  Most of the other stories certainly had their strong moments and I enjoyed reading them.  They just weren't the best.<br />The only exceptions were some of the harder SF stories, and that could very well just be a matter of personal taste.  Even these stories, however, were interesting in their own way.  Stephen Baxter's &quot;The Great Game&quot; is the only one that I really had a problem with other than that, and it's mostly to do with the one-dimensional aspect of the story.  A military team is inserted onto a planet to extract an academician who has been studying the planet's problems to see if the Xeelee are involved.  If so, a war could erupt.  This is an anti-war story that portrays something like the military industrial complex here on Earth, but makes the general in favour of starting the war way too obvious.  It's a caricature more than a character.<br />If you like your science fiction in short doses, this is a great anthology.  I am not as versed in the science fiction field as I am fantasy, but I'd say there's definitely a good cross-section of the best of the field in 2003.  The stories are definitely interesting, and if there's better stuff out there, then the field is pretty healthy.  Highly recommended.<br />David Roydifferent path then expected.

US	50332419	R2Q1M7Z07C08IJ	0553379216	2891951	The Grand Crusade (The DragonCrown War Cycle, Book 3)	Books	2	9	12	N	N	There are two reasons why this book stinks...	The Grand Crusade is the final chapter in the The Dragoncrown War Cycle.  The previous book suffered from some dreadfully dull passages, and I'm sorry to say the final book has the same problem.  Stackpole spends way too much time arranging the pieces for the final conflict, and not enough time making those pieces interesting.  The Dragoncrown War Cycle ends up being a series that starts on a high note and then plummets from there.<br />Will Norrington is dead.  Will is the man everybody believes was prophesized to be the one who kills Chytrine, the queen of the north and the woman who wants to take over the entire world.  Chytrine's armies are raiding the southern lands and the various provinces are fighting each other politically as much as they're fighting her.  King Scrainwood of Oriosa, a conniving coward, has made an arrangement with Chytrine in order to protect his kingdom and the seat of his power.  General Adrogans has beaten Chytrine in the west, but the rulers of the southern kingdoms fear that he will set up an empire for himself.  Paralyzed by politics and fear, it looks like Chytrine has an open invitation to take over everything.  Only a few heroes are willing to try and stop her, and they manage to get enough support to raise an army.  But all is not what it seems.  Is Will really alive, able to fulfill the prophecy?  As the southern armies fight for their lives, a new figure may emerge to decide Chytrine's fate.<br />The Grand Crusade does little to live up to its billing, feeling more like a half-hearted skirmish as far as this reader is concerned.  I was hoping for a riveting conclusion that would keep me on the edge of my seat, and I kept waiting for it to happen as Stackpole maneuvered everybody into their proper positions.  He places the various leaders at the head of their armies, has the expedition to the northlands put together, and makes sure everything's set.  Unfortunately, this takes up half the book and I had trouble keeping my eyes open.<br />The main problem is that the prose is very wooden, much more so then I remember the previous books being.  Most of the characterization and the dialogue felt forced and unreal.  Stackpole, both in his dialogue and in his narrative voice, uses a very annoying technique that just started getting on my nerves, especially when it happened in almost every chapter.  He starts to list things.  &quot;But he had acquiesced for two reasons.&quot;  Then, he goes on to talk about those two reasons.  Stackpole does it.  His characters do it.  I see Stackpole ticking off his fingers as he's writing, if that weren't a physical impossibility requiring three hands.  It's a symptom of the entire book, where he's constantly setting things up, describing everything without actually doing anything.<br />It gets worse as Stackpole sets up the battles.  Action is one of the things that Stackpole excels at.  He can be quite bloody in his descriptions (and when he gets to the battles in The Grand Crusade, he is still quite graphic, so be warned), but everything has a pace and intensity that I just marvel at.  He puts the reader down in the middle of the action and you almost find yourself looking behind you to make sure somebody's not coming up to you with a sword ready to skewer you.  It's quite effective, and the book has a lot of energy when he writes the combat scenes.  However, every time it looks like the battles are about to start, Stackpole starts setting them up again.  He shows us countless strategy sessions between the generals, and he has those same generals brood on those strategies some more before finally executing them (many times listing the various things that could go wrong).<br />Don't get me wrong.  I'm not an action junkie, needing the blood and guts to make a book good.  However, the non-combat part of the book has to be interesting, or give me the battles!  I found that I barely cared about any of the characters, including characters who I had cared about inthe previous books.  On the positive side, I didn't find any of the characters annoying, which is a step up for a couple of them (Kerrigan and Isaura).  Ultimately, I found that the battles were the only interesting things in the book, and I found myself getting annoyed when each battle would end and more strategizing happened.<br />While the battles themselves were wonderfully done, I found that the results of them too often had convenient resolutions, as somebody comes in and saves the day.  One battle has General Adrogans come from very far away and arrive at the perfect time to do what's necessary to turn the tide.  While he knows that the war is happening there, he has no idea what the exact situation is. He's just going to help as best he can, and he just happens to get there where he can make the biggest difference.  So many of the battles begin with our heroes acknowledging that they are in an almost impossible situation, and that even if they prevail they're going to lose a lot of soldiers.  However, most of the time they don't have to deal with that because something else happens.<br />Ultimately, if it wasn't for the battle scenes, this book would be the bottom of the barrel.  As it is, it's close.  I've seen so much better from Stackpole, and the series started out so wonderfully.  I didn't realize that I was already at the top when I started it.  If this wasn't the final book of the series, there's no way I would have finished it.  Avoid it if at all possible.<br />David Roythe previous books.

So many of the battles begin with our heroes acknowledging that they are in an almost impossible situation, and that even if they prevail they're going to lose a lot of soldiers.  However, most of the time they don't have to deal with that because something else happens.<br />Ultimately, if it wasn't for the battle scenes, this book would be the bottom of the barrel.  As it is, it's close.  I've seen so much better from Stackpole, and the series started out so wonderfully.  I didn't realize that I was already at the top when I started it.  If this wasn't the final book of the series, there's no way I would have finished it.  Avoid it if at all possible.<br />David Roy	2004-06-27

One of the common problems with trilogies is that the third book feels anticlimactic.  The ending never lives up to the 1000+  page set-up.  Jennifer Fallon thankfully does not fall prey to this in the Second Sons Trilogy.  Lord of the Shadows is just as exciting and interesting as the first two books.  I said in my review of Eye of the Labyrinth that I haven't read a book that fast in a long time.  Lord of the Shadows broke even that record.  I literally could not put it down, taking enough of a break to eat and that was about it.<br />Dirk Provin has apparently betrayed everything, and every one, he holds dear to return to the Shadow Dancers, the religion of the Goddess.  Unbeknownst to everybody else, though, Dirk has his own plans to bring their religion down around them.  His intricate plan involves reaching the highest levels and destroying it from within.  To do so, however, everybody must think the worst of him, and he is forced to use the extremely amoral Marqel, a girl who would like nothing better than to destroy Dirk.  Dirk walks a razor-thin edge to achieve his goals, and one wrong move will send him plummeting over the edge.  He's a man alone, cutting himself off from everybody to do what he sees as the greater good.  As he does so, the world teeters on the brink.  Love blossoms, and then is destroyed.  A crippled prince attempts to fulfill his destiny, a destiny that his power-hungry father never dreamed of.  Will Dirk succeed in his quest, or will all of his plans crumble at the whim of a bratty child who would do anything to consolidate her own power?<br />It hit me after I put down Lord of the Shadows.  After reading over 1500 pages of this series, there had only been two scenes of battle, and both of those had been very small.  The only &quot;magic&quot; was a trick played on everybody in the kingdom.  The entire Second Sons trilogy was a story of political intrigue on a grand scale.  Lord of the Shadows is a lot more streamlined then the first two books, however, as everything revolves around Dirk.  He even dominates the scenes that he's not in, as the discussion is often about him or how he relates to the characters in question.  Dirk has asked his cousin, Queen Alenor, to trust him no matter what happens, and she does.  Tia Veran, the woman who was more intimately betrayed by Dirk, continues her skepticism and hatred of the man, despite the fact that others seem to think he may have more up his sleeve then meets the eye.  Lip service is given to the Lion of Senet's schemes, but even those are mentioned mostly in relation to how Dirk will defeat him.  It's a better book for this precision, as every chapter leads inexorably to the final conclusion.  Even the subplots (such as Prince Misha and his imposed addiction to poppy-dust) eventually run up against Dirk's plans.<br />I found the characterization even better then in the first two books, as the two minor annoyances (Marqel and Tia) have their edges filed down just enough so that they're interesting without being shrill.  Tia still hates and distrusts Dirk, but her relationship with Misha softens that and gives her something to do other than bad-mouth him.  Marqel is still the conniving harlot, but her internal voice is toned down a bit.  Dirk is again characterized wonderfully as he has to constantly run to keep the various plates spinning.  As it all looks set to come down around his ears, he's rescued from an unlikely source (one of the few things in the novel that's a little too coincidental).  He quickly rights himself and keeps the ball rolling.<br />There were a couple of minor problems.  The above-mentioned coincidence is one thing, and another is the convenient way that various relationships end.  While the ending is downbeat for a few characters (including one tragic one that I didn't quite see coming, at least not in the fashion it happened), there are far too many &quot;and they lived happily ever after&quot; results as far as relationships go.  This isn't a criticism of the ending, which is riveting, but more how things end up after the climax of the book.<br />One of the things I really liked about this entire series, especially Lord of the Shadows is how none of the characters are &quot;clean.&quot;  They all have their own motivations and sometimes those motivations result in some nasty things.  Dirk is the protagonist, and his actions are resulting in a lot of innocent deaths.  He's torn by each one of them, but he's willing to go through it in order to bring down the Shadow Dancers.  The reader gets the impression, however, that no matter how much he's doing this for the people of Dhevyn and especially those &quot;heretics&quot; who don't believe in the Goddess, but he's also doing it because of what their religion has cost him personally.  It's cost him his mother, his father, his adopted father, and his honor.<br />One final prop I'll give this book, and the entire series as well, is its unpredictability.  So many times I thought I knew what was going to happen, only to have it pulled out from under me.  Dirk unleashes his plan a lot earlier then I expected him to.  The event that brings about the beginning of the end I thought was just going to be a demonstration to further install Marqel as High Priestess, so I was truly shocked.  Fallon has a remarkable flare for the dramatic, and that entire chapter held me tightly.  This applies to her prose throughout the entire book.<br />Pick this entire series up.  If you like fantasy (and don't mind that there isn't much hack-n-slash), you'll love it.<br />David Roygo.

US	50332419	R2AR7GQGYSAHKY	0563538597	752924749	Blue Box (Doctor Who)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A sub-par effort from one of Who's best novelists	Kate Orman is one of the premiere Doctor Who writers today, along with Lance Parkin.  When I pick up a book with her name on it, especially a Doctor Who book, I know it's going to be special.  She can adapt her style to whatever story she wants to tell.  However, she's always written for the &quot;new&quot; Doctor, never a Past Doctor.  So when I heard that she was writing a Sixth Doctor book, I was intrigued.  When I was finally able to get it, I snapped it up.  Blue Box demonstrates once again that Orman has a way with characterization that makes the author-wannabe in me cry.  She's captured the regulars almost to a T.  The problem is that the book...well, it's a bit dull, actually.<br />No sooner do the Doctor and Peri land in Washington DC in 1981, then the Doctor just disappears.  Peri searches for a while, and then goes to a hotel room to wait for him (thankfully, the Doctor has a seemingly infinite line of credit, something I'm very envious of).  When the Doctor finally gets ahold of her, he asks her to track down Bob Salmon, a computer hacker who helped him out.  Together with an intrepid computer reporter, the Doctor and friends are trying to track down pieces of a valuable artifact, an alien device that could spell the world's doom if it falls into the wrong hands, hands like those of Sarah Swan.  Swan is the ultimate hacker, not caring about world domination, but instead craving the power that computers will have over everybody.  To Swan, this will be the ultimate computer, and will allow her to do anything she wants.  That's not something the Doctor can allow. Blue Box is the story of the history of computers and hacking, and what one woman almost did to bring it all under one thumb.<br />Techno-thrillers are all the rage right now, but most of them are on the cutting edge, with fancy gadgets and computer power that makes something the size of a fingernail be able to run the world's computers.  Blue Box isn't like that, though.  It's the dawn of the computer age and the Internet, when only 200 computers were on the Net.  The Doctor and Salmon do their hacking on an Apple II, for goodness sake!  Orman has all the lingo down pat, pointing out how bulky the computers are, how slow they were.  One of the benefits of setting the book in the past is that you can have the characters make a lot of &quot;predictions&quot; and you get to choose how far off-base they are.  Orman seems to have a blast with this, with Salmon talking about how one day people will be ordering pizza online, and how you can't have the general public on the Net or it will go completely down the tubes.<br />Orman's characterizations are wonderful, especially the Doctor and Peri's.  Peri's having a crisis of conscience, wondering what her place with the Doctor really is.  She's completely out of her element in this environment, not knowing anything about computers.  It gets incredibly boring watching him hack away at the keyboard, and she jumps at any chance to actually do something.  The book seems to take place right at the junction between the two television seasons that featured Peri, as they still bicker like a married couple but it's not as harsh as it was in their first season together.  The second season seemed to have wiped most of it away, which was too abrupt a change.  Here, they have their tiffs but you can see the underlying friendship beneath the whole thing.<br />There are two major problems with the book, though.  The first is the dullness.  There's only so much excitement to be had out of people talking to each other on computers, threatening each other on computers, and breaking into people's computers.  Orman tries to put some action into it, and there is the usual exciting climax, but much of the book consists of somebody typing away at somebody else.  This can be effecting in character studies or books about relationships, but in a Doctor Who book it just falls flat.  Orman tries gamely with the characterizations, but I had to plow through the boring parts to get to the good ones.<br />One other major problem is something I have never seen from Orman before, and that's sloppiness.  The book is told as if it's an expose by a journalist.  Yet there are scenes that there is no way the narrator could have seen.  Perhaps some of it is &quot;fictionalized,&quot; but even if that's the case, there are some perspective changes that don't match the style.  When Swan is cursing the reporter out in her mind on page 254, he keeps referring to himself in the third person.  It was quite strange.  Even worse then this, though, is the sloppiness as far as where people are in relation to the story.  There's one sequence where the Doctor's supposed to be alone, and we know where Peri and Bob are (back at the reporter's apartment).  Yet it then says &quot;Behind the Doctor, Peri and Bob were wincing.&quot;  While I can't place any other specific incidents of this, I did get that feeling a couple of other times as well.  It's almost like she wasn't quite paying attention, or perhaps something changed and she forgot to go back and erase all of the tracks.<br />The characterizations are what bring this book up to the level that I'm putting it.  If they weren't spot-on, this would easily be a 3-star book.  Because of them, however, I'm bumping it up to four.  It's still one of the weakest books I've seen from Orman, though.  Here's hoping her next one will be up to her usual level.<br />David Royow through the boring parts to get to the good ones.<br />One other major problem is something I have never seen from Orman before, and that's sloppiness.

The question would be whether or not she could follow up such a stunning debut novel and avoid the dreaded sophomore jinx.  I'm pleased to say that she does an excellent job.  Not only is Camera Obscura just as good, but it's good in a much different way.  Gone is the mysticism that City of the Dead had in spades.  Gone is the magical reality.  Gone is the New Orleans atmosphere.  However, she captures the atmosphere of Victorian England with vivid descriptions and the same style as she did in the first book.  It all adds up to a wonderful book.<br />Back in The Adventuress of Henrietta Street, the Doctor had one of his two hearts taken away, supposedly for his own good.  It was the heart that was linked to Gallifrey, a planet that had been destroyed by his own hand and then wiped from his memory.  His sometimes ally and sometimes enemy Sabbath removed it to save his life, but implanted it in his own chest so that he could time travel too.  Both he and the Doctor have been on a mission ever since to heal the wounds in of the timestream that were caused by the destruction of the Time Lords, to police the time travel that they used to police.  A rogue time machine has appeared in Victorian England, the use of which has already caused some temporal disruptions.  Whoever has used it has been fractured in different ways.  One person has been split into eight separate but equal beings, all sharing the same mind and perceptions.  Another has been split into two individual beings, one good and compassionate, one dark and mutated.  And one has been split inside her own mind, with multiple personalities inhabiting one body.  The Doctor is trying desperately to stop the machine before it's used again.  Sabbath has the same goal, but for much different reasons.  The Doctor has discovered that the heart Sabbath stole has created an inseparable bond between them.  Through that bond, the Doctor discovers Sabbath's horrifying vision of the timestream, causing the Doctor to have yet one more person to watch out for.<br />Rose has quite the way with words, both dialogue and description.  Her England oozes atmosphere, with a mad chase through dank and dark Dartmoor or a dark and eerie mansion that somebody's trying to break into.  You can feel the darkness of the dungeon the Doctor is kept in, almost feeling claustrophobic despite being in a well-lit room reading a book.  The streets of London are just as crowded as they are in the 21st century, but this time with horses, carriages, and boys paid to run through the streets and pick up dung.  Everything is quite vivid.<br />The characterizations are wonderful as well.  This is the Doctor and Sabbath's book, and everybody else takes second billing.  The banter between the two is electric, trading barbs and trying to convince each other of the rightness of their cause.  The Doctor is horrified when he finds out what Sabbath ultimately wants to do to safeguard time itself, refusing to believe that the ends justify the means.  The Doctor is at his most compassionate, almost crushed when he realizes that he's led someone to his death.  Sabbath accuses the Doctor of the ultimate arrogance while demonstrating that he's even more so.  The book is filled with these scenes, and I don't think there was one false note in them.  They realize that they need each other this time and that they have to put all of their past animosities behind them.  The final act gives Sabbath a human quality that he's lacked the last few books he's appeared in, an act of compassion that also, as always, has an ulterior motive.<br />The rest of the characters fulfill their function but aren't anything special.  Rose does just enough to avoid making them caricatures without making the reader that interested in them.  Unfortunately, both Fitz and Anji fall into this category.  Don't get me wrong.  They're characterization is spot on, but they are relegated to the sidelines and have almost nothing to do with the entire story.  They're bit players that take up screen time, do some small part to move the storyline forward, and then run offstage.  The Doctor is not telling them what's going on, which isn't really anything new.  This time, however, it makes them surprisingly ineffective.  They show up to point the Doctor in the right direction once or twice, set events in motion that will result in the Doctor's rescue occasionally, but that's it.  Ultimately it doesn't matter, though.  Rose captures the Doctor and Sabbath so well that it doesn't matter that nobody else does anything much of interest.<br />I really enjoyed Camera Obscura.  Despite the fact that it was about the nature of time itself, I found it to be a lot clearer then City of the Dead.  While Rose handled that magical realism very well, I think she excelled even more doing a science fiction story this time around.  The plot is straightforward, though it's never boring.  It's a lot easier to understand, and it has the added benefit of not annoying those Doctor Who fans who don't want even a hint of magic in their Who.  While it is part of the ongoing Eighth Doctor storyline, Camera Obscura could easily stand on its own feet if it happened to be the first Who book you've read.  So what are you waiting for?<br />David Royory.  Don't get me wrong.

Book two of the Second Sons Trilogy is Eye of the Labyrinth, and the question is:  can she keep it up?  We already have over 500 pages of it, and we're only a third of the way done.  The answer is yes.  Eye of the Labyrinth is even better then Lion of Senet, mainly because the action is already under way.  The book is so full of people plotting against each other that they make Machiavelli look like a reasonably nice guy.  Of course, that's part of the book's charm.<br />After the chilling events toward the end of Lion of Senet, Dirk Provin, the second son of the Duke of Elcast, is hiding out with King Johan's people, the man who had to die in order to save them.  Dirk is feeling tremendous guilt, and while everybody there seems to accept him, there is one woman, Tia, who refuses to trust him.  She sees him as nothing but a spoiled rich brat who will betray them to the Lion of Senet as soon as he's able to.  Meanwhile, to bring Dirk out into the open, the Lion intends to execute Dirk's mother now that the Duke has died and his protection of her is gone.  The rescue attempt reveals long-buried hatreds, schemes, and may even bring down a religion, as false as it is.  It's not only the Lion who wants Dirk, however.  The High Priestess Belagren also wants him, because only he can tell her when the Second Sun will go away again.  If she can't accurately predict it, her religion will go up in smoke as belief falls away.  But Dirk has plans of his own, and nobody can see what they are.<br />I said in my review of Lion of Senet that I couldn't put that book down.  Unfortunately, I had to because of work and other things to do during the week.  I started Eye of the Labyrinth late on a Friday night, and I was done by Sunday afternoon.  This book I could literally not put down, and I raced through it because I had to know what happened next.  All of the characters are so detailed and three-dimensional that only a series this big could contain them.  Dirk spends most of the book only hinting at what his plans are, and nothing is ever what it seems.  Years have passed by the end of the book, and most of the younger characters have grown and changed a lot in that time.  There's Princess Alenor of the kingdom of Dhevyn, who has loved Prince Kirshov (the Lion's second son) since arrived in Senet as a prisoner, and who has known ever since then that Kirsh would be her husband and regent eventually.  She undergoes a massive change as she realizes that Kirsh will never love her, and has lost his heart to Marqel, a girl who will do anything and sleep with anybody to get the power she craves.  Alenor shows a lot of courage when she faces Kirsh down on their wedding night, as well as deciding that she would join the plotting of Dirk's friends against the Lion.<br />All of the characters are this good and it's impossible to single any particularly good character out.  It's far easier to point out one weakness.  Once again, it's Marqel.  She is truly power-hungry, murdering at the drop of a hat when it suits her whims.  That particular aspect of the character is fine, as we have seen and enjoyed completely amoral characters before.  However, she becomes quite annoying to read about at times as she continually schemes and has internal dialogues where she details what those schemes will be.  I found the character to be believable, but I don't think that she was written very well.<br />The only other fault in this otherwise flawless novel is Tia.  She's a good character and I do like her, but it got old to hear Tia internally telling herself that she can't trust Dirk or that she can't believe that everybody else is trusting him.  The repetition serves a purpose as the events of the novel pan out, but it really began to grate on my nerves whenever she was in the story.  What happens to her is tragic and I really felt for her, but I also cringed because I knew it would just cause more of the same.  Hopefully the third book will have her toned down a bit, but I'm not holding my breath.<br />I can't say enough about the plotting or the prose, however.  Fallon has a way with words that makes you want to keep reading, and her plot just draws you in so tightly that you can't break free.  Perhaps there are a couple more coincidences then are believable (which creates a couple of very predictable scenes), but overall the book is full of surprises.  Fallon avoids the clich&eacute; of the dramatic rescue and instead uses the failure of that rescue to move the plot forward.  There are a couple of opportunities for Fallon to fall prey to this, but she only does it when it's right for the story.  The schemes of all the characters can make you dizzy at times, but you just have to pay attention.  It isn't that difficult as long as you don't skim the book.  As you watch the schemes unfold, and watch the characters change things on the fly as circumstances make the ground underneath them shake, you'll have a lot of fun.<br />Fallon has created a wonderful world and a neat set of characters to inhabit it.  Hopefully Lord of the Shadows will bring it all to a satisfying conclusion.  I know I'm holding my breath for the finale.<br />David RoyI also cringed because I knew it would just cause more of the same.

Jennifer Fallon's Lion of Senet, the first book in her Second Sons trilogy, is simply a fun read.  Fallon is not a new writer, but she is new to North American audiences, with this book just coming out this year.  Thankfully, Bantam is publishing all three books within months of each other, so the third book is actually out.  Having read the first two from the library, I am chomping at the bit to read the third.<br />The title of the series has a double meaning (the two suns that Ranadon orbits around, as well as the obvious meaning).  I like that touch. First, not only is Dirk a second son, but his friend Kirsch is the Lion's second son.  Both will become heavily involved in all of the schemes flying around the area.  Secondly, the second sun disappearing for a time plays a large part in the series.  The last time that happened, anarchy reigned and Belagren and the Lion were able to take power because Belagren was able to say when the sun would reappear (because the Goddess told her, she said).  She told the Lion that he would have to sacrifice one of his children to bring it out, knowing full well that it would come naturally even without this.  Now, the secret of when the next \\"Age of Shadows\\" will come is hidden from her, and she's desperate to find out.<br />There is an underlying tension between science and religion in the book, with Fallon coming down on the side of science (at least within the series itself).  The \\"true\\" Goddess religion is rarely, if ever mentioned, and only Belagren's perverted form is present.  Her opponents are firm believers that the Age of Shadows is a scientific thing and not a religious one.  And, of course, we are shown that they are right.  Lip service is given to how Belagren has moved away from the real Goddess, but we aren't given much information so it appears that there is no \\"real\\" religion on Ranadon.  I found that disappointing.<br />That is the only disappointment for me, however.  Fallon does a wonderful job of both plotting and characterization.  The plot is very centralized (the Lion has control of Dhevyn and wants to solidify that control, and Belagren wants to keep her own hold on power) but yet it is vast.  It covers at least three years in this book alone, and ranges all over the islands and into Senet itself.  While there are a few too many predictable \\"one day I'll have power, and then you'd better watch out\\" proclamations, the story itself actually has a fair number of surprises.  King Johan's fate truly surprised me, as the expected rescues didn't happen, and what ultimately does happen to him knocked me for a loop.  In fact, that entire scene, the confrontation between the Lion, Johan, Dirk, and a few others (I won't reveal more) is riveting.  And that's not even the ending of the book!<br />This leads into Fallon's prose.  The text grabbed me and wouldn't let me go until I finished the book.  I had a lot of trouble putting the book down, as the Fallon's descriptions amazed me and her dialogue was almost flawless.  The characterization was wonderful as well, with only Marqel feeling a bit too forced.  I did find that both Kirsch and her being instantly obsessed with each other was a bit unbelievable, but I was able to get past it very quickly because I was so entranced with everybody else.  There are too many characters to name (as they're all good), but Dirk is the main one, and he is almost perfect.  He's very intelligent and he just wants to become a physician.  He finds himself trapped in all of the political games (especially once his secret is revealed to him) and just wants to be left alone.  Since that's not going to happen, though, he has to use his wits and discovers that he's capable of playing the political game as well.  When he has to commit a final horrible but compassionate action, he's devastated but able to think on his feet.<br />The plot is so intricate that if the characterization failed, the book would fall apart.  It's the characters who build the foundation and make the reader interested in the complicated story.  And it is complicated, with scheming going on all over the place.  But it's well worth the time and effort to keep things straight, and it's not really that complicated if you pay attention.  There is almost no combat in the novel, but there is a torture scene that made me a bit squeamish.  Unfortunately for those weak-of-heart, it's in the middle of the riveting scene mentioned above, so you may just have to put up with it.  It's not that bad, though.  Just grin and bear it.

US	50332419	R3FBFKGBBA40NB	0743470737	87376754	Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Prophecy and Change Anthology	Books	5	1	3	N	N	A wonderful collection of DS9 short stories	Star Trek: Deep Space Nine recently celebrated its 10th anniversary.  To mark the event, Pocket Books produced a short story collection called Prophecy &amp; Change.  Using the conceit from the episode \\"The Visitor,\\" the framing story has an older Jake Sisko visited on a rainy night by a young woman, an aspiring writer.  He spends the night regaling her with tales of his time on the station, which these happen to be.  Despite the fact that a couple of the stories don't really fit this mold (the Garak story being the most unlikely for Jake to know), it's a nice idea that really works well.  I can say that there are no bad stories in this volume, and some very good ones make this an excellent collection.<br />The stories take place along the timeline of the TV series, beginning with a story that takes place days after the series premiere, \\"The Emissary,\\" and ending with a story set during the post-series novels.  Each season is represented except the second, with most of the stories weighted toward the end of the series.  While the stories seem to be leaning toward Quark and Odo, each character gets his/her time in the spotlight, which is a nice touch.  Sisko and Kira are the most shortchanged, with only the first story, \\"Ha'Mara\\" (by Kevin G. Summers) concentrating on them.  \\"Ha'Mara is an effective tale that ties together \\"The Emissary\\" and \\"Past Prologue\\" and explaining how the relationship between Sisko and Kira mellowed a little bit between the two.  Kai Opaka proclaims that Sisko is the emissary from the Prophets.  Kira has a lot of trouble believing that some outsider, especially somebody from the Federation could be their savior.  They get a lot of time to argue, however, when they and two Bajoran children are trapped in an underground labyrinth by a cave-in.  It's a very effective character story for the two of them, and the story is only marred by the heavy-handed characterization of Colonel Day, a Bajoran militia member who would also love to throw the Federation off Bajor and who hopes to use the cave-in as a way to discredit Opaka.<br />A few of the stories explain little continuity bits from the series that never were really explained.  Thankfully, these stories move beyond that and are good stories in themselves, or else the book would have serious problems.  \\"The Orb of Opportunity\\" (by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels) tells us why Nog decided to strike out on his own and eventually join Starfleet.  In this story, an orb is being returned to the Bajorans by the Cardassians, but it gets hijacked by a band of Maquis (Federation citizens who are fighting the Cardassians because a treaty put their homeworlds in Cardassian territory).  The orb is in a Ferengi lockbox, and only somebody with the ears of a Ferengi can open it.  Rom refuses to go along after being browbeaten by his brother Quark, so Kai Winn secretly enlists Nog's help.  After having an orb vision of the future, Nog even decides to forego payment in advance to help!  He sees an opportunity that he feels he has to take.  The story is very touching, with everybody being characterized wonderfully.  Winn is the perfect balance between wily manipulator and a Bajoran religious leader who just wants what's best for her people.  She's almost sympathetic, but then she does something that just makes you want to shoot her.<br />The book has a nice mixture of old and new writers, which is another plus.  The pride and joy of the book, however, is another tale by Andrew J. Robinson, the man who played Garak on the series.  The last story in the collection, it details the story of Garak and how he is helping Cardassia heal from the horrors of Dominion occupation, where millions died.  Some time has passed, and the Cardassians have been through civil war and massive plague which has wiped out even more of his people.  This takes place after A Stitch in Time and a stage play written by Robinson and performed at conventions when Robinson and Alexander Siddig are both there.  Robinson writes Garak so well, and the story is only marred by the fact that I felt lost at times when he was referring to the events of the play.  He tries to put explanations in there, but it just seemed too much.  I think it was a mistake to have it be a direct sequel to something that hardly anybody (relatively speaking) is going to see.  Still, Robinson shows that he is a gifted writer as well as actor, making the conflicts interesting even when the reader doesn't quite understand what's going on.<br />As I said earlier, there really isn't a bad story in the bunch.  The weakest story is probably the Ezri Dax story, \\"Chiaroscuro\\" (by Geoffrey Thorne), which has Ezri going to Pandora station to open a puzzle that Jadzia Dax set so that only another Dax would be able to do it.  The story takes place shortly after Ezri boards Deep Space Nine so she's still unsure of herself.  I found that the writing didn't grab me and the puzzles that Ezri had to solve just weren't that interesting.  Ezri sees a side of Jadzia Dax that she's never seen, but neither have we so we don't really identify with it.  It's a young Jadzia, inexperienced and emotional, and ultimately the story just falls flat.<br />Overall, this is a wonderful collection.  It's so great that I spent a Sunday morning plowing through it (which I never do) because I couldn't put it down.  That's the seal of approval as far as I'm concerned.  If you're a Deep Space Nine fan, you owe it to yourself to pick this up right away.  And I'm anxiously awaiting Tales from the Dominion War as well.<br />David Royhere.

US	50332419	RKR46JPCE76TP	0887621333	170121813	Juno: Canadians at D-Day, June 6, 1944	Books	5	4	4	N	N	The story of the Canadian contingent on D-Day	It's fitting that I write this review on June 6, 60 years to the day after one of the greatest invasions of our, or any other, time.  June 6 is, of course, D-Day, the day where the Allies put 130,000 troops onto the shores of Normandy against the withering fire of a firmly entrenched German army.  No one who wasn't there can truly imagine the horrors of that day, the courage involved or the determination that resulted in the final Allied victory, the first of many to come before Hitler's war machine was finally destroyed for good.  Five beaches were stormed that day:  Omaha and Utah beach by the Americans, Sword and Gold beach by the British, and Juno beach by the Canadians.  Often, the Canadians are bunched together with the British, and thus do not get the recognition that they so deserved.  Roughly 15,000 Canadians put ashore that day.  Almost 1,000 were casualties by the end of the day.  Juno: Canadians at D-Day, by Ted Barris, is their story, finally out in the open.<br />We were not there, so we cannot imagine the terror or the will to get past that terror as bullets ricochet around us.  Ted Barris does the next best thing, however.  He talks to the people who were there.  Juno: Canadians at D-Day is nothing but remembrances either given to the author by those who were there, or culled from their diaries.  Each chapter is divided into sections where the events are told by one man or another, time-stamped to give the reader an idea of when these events took place.  This technique does give the book a scattershot feel that isn't always the easiest to follow, as Barris jumps around both in time and space, from 6:00 am that morning to 12:00 am the night before, from the beach to the villages where the paratroopers dropped, and even back to England where we get the air crews' stories.  Barris covers everything, from some French villagers to the crew of minesweepers responsible for clearing a path through the minefields and onto the beach.  Yes, it is disjointed, but it also adds to the personal feel of reminiscence that the book gives.  Normally, I don't like disjointed narratives, but this was an exception.  It kept me captivated, and each section was brief enough that it didn't wear out its welcome before moving on to something else.  Barris returns periodically to some of the men, so the book does not gloss over their stories.  It just tells them in its own way, like veterans passing war stories around the table.<br />Given the way the Canadian story is often glossed over, the book shares many facts that aren't necessarily common knowledge.  The Canadian troops were responsible for the deepest penetration by the end of the first day ashore.  A company of Canadian paratroopers dropped with the British and were responsible for destroying every bridge that they had set out to destroy, in order to slow down any German counterattack.  And one of the most famous pieces of newsreel footage from the invasion was shot by a Canadian, Sergeant Bill Grant.  He had his camera rolling as the landing ramp crashed down and the troops jumped into the water.  It was shown in movie houses in Britain, Canada and the United States, though sadly in the US it was never stated that these were Canadian troops being shown.  Barris has provided quite a service by highlighting a part of this day that never makes it into the spotlight.<br />This is not to say that the book doesn't have its faults, however.  Barris spends a bit too much time talking about the journalists involved, bringing the story back home.  While their role was important, I think Barris gives them more time to the detriment of other stories that could have been told.  He even quotes one journalist complaining about how other journalists make too much of the story about themselves, how much hardship they had to go through to get the story, instead of giving the story of the troops on the line. I wish Barris would have taken that a little more to heart.<br />There are two things included in the book that really make me sing its praises, however.  The first is an entire section from the point of view of the \\"service guys.\\"  These are the men who were responsible for logistics, for keeping the army moving as efficiently as possible.  While they were never on the front lines (they did occasionally get shelled, however), they did their job with aplomb. It's nice to see some recognition for the little guys.<br />Secondly, the final chapter tells the story of the Juno memorial, dedicated on June 6, 2003.  A lot of time and effort was made by both veterans and their families to get this memorial built on land donated by the village of Courseulles-sur-Mer, which is right behind Juno.  Commemorative bricks were sold to raise money as the cost swiftly rose from several hundred thousand dollars to $11 million.  They succeeded, and Barris details not only their efforts, but the results of those efforts.  The commemoration ceremony on that day was very touching, and I have to admit that I had tears in my eyes as I finally laid the book down.  Barris has succeeded in his aim to personalize the Canadian story of D-Day.  Even if you think you're familiar with what happened on that fateful day, you owe it to yourself to pick this book up.<br />David Royuded in the book that really make me sing its praises, however.

US	50332419	R1GFR5CN93TDS	0345459164	639235887	Star Wars: Survivor's Quest	Books	4	47	50	N	N	What do you get when you cross two jedi?	One of the nice things about Del Ray's series of Star Wars books is that they are not just concentrating on their New Jedi Order books.  They are also producing some books that take place further back in the Star Wars novel history, when Bantam was running the show.  Thus, they can refer to events that took place in earlier books (such as Tatooine Ghost), and they can even supply sequels.  Timothy Zahn's Survivor's Ghost is one of those, and it's quite thrilling.<br />Luke Skywalker and Mara Jada Skywalker, married for three years now, are helping Mara's old boss, Talon Karrde, go straight by informing some of his old friends that he will no longer be doing business with them.  After rebuking one irate customer, Karrde catches up with them and gives them a message to go to Nirauan (the planet where they faced down the Hand of Thrawn in Vision of the Future).  There, they are told that Outbound Flight, an exploratory mission sent out by the Old Republic 50 years ago, has been found by the Chiss (who happen to be the species of their old enemy, Admiral Thrawn).  Outbound Flight was a ring of six massive dreadnaught battleships bound to an inner core, resulting in a huge ship, but the Chiss reportedly destroyed it years ago.  The Chiss have asked Luke and Mara to come and inspect it, representing the New Republic. They have to keep their eyes and ears open, however, as old enemies show up as well as new.  Who will be their allies and who will betray them?  Mara also has to come to terms with her former life as the Emperor's Hand during the time of the Empire, making a decision that could change her life forever.  Luke and Mara have to stretch their Jedi skills to the maximum to make it out of the bowels of Outbound Flight alive, as well as preventing a galactic war.<br />I love the fact that the recent Star Wars non-NJO books have focused on only a few of our favourite characters.  This gives the book an opportunity to really expand on their characterization, as well as explain certain changes between the old series and the New Jedi Order books.  Survivor's Quest focuses exclusively on Luke and Mara, their relationship, and Mara's past.  I've always enjoyed Mara, as she's one of the most dynamic new Star Wars (i.e. non-movie) character around.  She's gone through massive changes since Zahn's first novel, where she wanted nothing more then to kill Luke Skywalker.  Now they're married, sharing a bond that goes beyond love, a bond through the Force.  When they first meet up with Commander Fel (the son of one of their old enemies) and his stormtrooper squad, memories flood her, memories of her time with the Empire.  She begins to fall into old habits of command.  She has a case of \\"survivor's guilt,\\" as she realizes that while the Emperor was horrible, some of the Imperial policies may have actually been good.  She and Luke have seen the New Republic struggle with petty wars and other conflicts among member planets, and the Imperials were efficient. Watching her thoughts is very intriguing.<br />The best thing about this is that Zahn doesn't push this in the reader's face by trying to explain it.  Instead, the reader gets to see some of her thought processes as she handles the situations that come up during the events of the novel.  Luke occasionally presses her to talk, but he's usually unsuccessful.  Instead, he just has to be supportive as well as being a good teammate.  Watching them work together was a real treat.  We've seen it in the New Jedi Order books, but this is when it was still fresh, and it was a wonder to see.<br />Mara is Zahn's creation, so it's not surprising that he handles her well.  The good thing is that he handles pretty much everybody else reasonably well too.  This is especially true of Fel and, to a lesser extent, the stormtroopers.  The troopers are individualized as far as having names goes, though they aren't given a great deal of character.  One negative is that a big deal is made of one of the troopersbeing an alien, which would have been unheard of in the Empire's time where anti-alien prejudice was prominent.  However, nothing much is made of it other then the odd mention or two.  Still, the book does a good job (along with Tatooine Ghost) of making the troopers much more competent then they were in the movies.  Fel is an interesting character to watch as he leads his squad in action.  He's thoroughly competent and intelligent, and the best thing you can say about him is that you're not wishing for the book to go back to someone else when he's on screen.<br />There are some unanswered questions that bring the book down, however.  There is a scene in the middle of the book where Fel and one of his troopers talk about hiding something on the Chiss ship, but it's never referred to again.  After this scene, you keep expecting the Imperials to eventually do something that they never do.  It was jarring.  Secondly, the animosity that the Outbound Flight survivors have toward Jedi is never explained.  These feelings have a major impact on the story and the result, but we are given no reason why it exists.  Is it just because the Jedi failed to successfully fight off the Chiss when they attacked?  If so, it seems rather harsh to be feeling that way 50 years later.<br />All in all, Survivor's Quest is an effective tale, full of action and great characterization of the main characters.  While there are some plotting difficulties as mentioned above, it's an enjoyable read, especially for those who are getting a bit tired of The New Jedi Order.

She's also known as a meticulous researcher, and she shows that again in this book. 1610 is a wonderful book that just starts a little too slow.<br />1610 is a year of change. Edward Fludd has perfected the mathematics of telling the future. However, he doesn't like what he sees, so he determines to change it. This is the year where that change becomes possible. Valentin Rochefort, a duellist and down on his luck aristocrat, as well as servant to the French spymaster Sully, is having his own problems. He is supposed to set up the assassination of his monarch, Henry IV, but it's designed to be a fake. Too bad for him that it happens to succeed. Disgraced and forced to run, he encounters his nemesis, Dariole, who revels in humiliating him, especially by being 16 years old and able to beat him at swordplay. Dariole ends up running with him, and they both find themselves trapped in Fludd's web. Fludd intends to use Rochefort in an assassination of his own, one that will change the future the way he wants it to be. With the addition of a shipwrecked Japanese samurai, agendas clash, different honor systems conflict, and secrets are revealed. The story goes all over the world, from France to England to Portugal and then to Japan before returning for an intriguing finish. There's even time for a little romance as well.<br />1610 is written as if it were a computer-generated reconstructed translation of a fire-damaged manuscript written by Rochefort. This allows the \\"translator\\" to include other documents as well, so each part (the book is separated into five) begins with something other than his memoirs. Sometimes it's a translator's note or a partially reconstructed entry from Saburo to his Japanese liege-lord. These give us a little bit more background information that Rochefort wouldn't necessarily be privy to, enabling the reader to have a more well-rounded story. It's an effective way to write, and Rochefort makes a wonderful narrator. He's witty and he's not afraid to admit his own mistakes (and there are many). The only thing that's not completely realistic about this is that there is no white-washing whatsoever. There's no effort to make Rochefort look good, which is what would probably happen with anybody else's memoirs. Rochefort's honesty is refreshing, however.<br />With the book being told in first person, it would have been very easy to make the other characters wooden. Thankfully, Gentle avoids this, with both Dariole and Saburo being superb. The relationship between Dariole and Rochefort is riveting, especially when Dariole's secret is revealed and Rochefort has to adjust. Saburo is fascinating because Japan is an unknown entity at this point, with just a few western explorers having been there. The culture clash between Saburo and Rochefort, and even Dariole to an extent (though Dariole seems a lot more willing to learn from Saburo, being only 16 and impressionable) makes a good subplot to the main action. It gets even more interesting when Saburo has to choose between duty to his leader and duty to the man who saved his life. Gentle handles all of these differing cultures admirably, showing again how detailed her research is.<br />The only bad thing I have to say about the book is that the beginning is horribly slow. I almost gave up on it after 60 pages, especially when a bizarre sexual encounter took place. I was beginning to wonder if this is the type of book that I'm not interested in reading. I persevered, though, and discovered a rich, yet clearly adult, novel with wonderful prose and fascinating characters. Once Rochefort and Dariole leave Paris, the book takes off at a frenetic yet leisurely pace. I know that doesn't appear to make sense, but the story seems tobe moving even when Gentle is pausing for breath. 1610 is a book that's hard to put down, even during these breaks. When there's no action, there are still plenty of ideas being put forward, or beautiful character interaction to keep the reader entertained.<br />I have to reiterate that this is definitely an adult novel. There are some sexual situations in it, as well as some adult concepts. As long as that doesn't bother you, 1610 is a wonderful book.<br />David Roybe moving even when Gentle is pausing for breath. 1610 is a book that's hard to put down, even during these breaks.

I have been on record as wishing that fantasy authors would start writing some stand-alone titles (see Mystic Warrior for the latest).  When I started book 1 of The Conclave of Shadows series by Raymond E. Feist (Talon of the Silver Hawk), I thought that I was embarking on yet another long, winding series of books.  Imagine my surprise when I finished Feist's latest book, King of Foxes and realized something.  It ended!  I couldn't believe it.  Ending after book 2 is almost unheard of nowadays.  That was already one plus for the book.  Now, the question was:  was the book any good?  Much like Talon of the Silver Hawk, the book was somewhat enjoyable if predictable, with a few other problems besides that manage to bring it down.<br />Talon, the last surviving member of the Orosini, has successfully taken the first step in avenging his people, having killed the man who was leading the attack on his home.  He still has to kill the man who ordered the attack, however, Kaspar, the Duke of Olasko.  Talon has been taken in and trained by the Conclave of Shadows, but thankfully their goals coincide.  The Conclave wants to get information on the evil wizard, Leso Varen, who has been aiding (perhaps controlling) Kaspar.  In order to do so, Talon must swear an oath to Kaspar in order to enter his employ.  Talon, being the kind of man he is, cannot swear a false oath, but he agrees to do it knowing that Kaspar will eventually betray him and the oath will be void.  Then Talon can kill him.  In doing so, however, Talon has to do some things he's not especially proud of.  Will he be able to stay the man he is without losing his humanity?  Once the inevitable happens, Talon has to face his toughest challenge yet as he fights to bring the Duke and his wizard down.<br />King of Foxes continues the story of Talon, and thus Feist writes in the same way as he did in the first book.  That should be a good thing, right?  Actually, in this case it's not.  Some of the bits that were delightfully eccentric in the first book (such as starting each chapter with one sentence along the lines of &quot;Talon stared&quot;) become increasingly annoying in the second book, as Feist doesn't keep them consistent.  These stylistic mannerisms end up drawing attention to themselves and start to grate.<br />Another thing that I didn't mention in my review of the first book, but perhaps should have, is the portrayal of women.  It becomes prominent in my mind by being worse then the first book.  There is not one sympathetic female character in King of Foxes.  Every woman in the book lusts after Talon (and seems to be promiscuous even away from Talon) and he manages to bed every woman who is actually named in the book.  Natalia, Kaspar's sister, comes closest to being fleshed out, but even she is just a tool in her brother's schemes.  She reaches out to Talon as a bed-partner because she knows that she will eventually be married off as an alliance for somebody.  She claims that the ability to love has been taken away from her, but if there were anybody who could fill that role, it would be Talon.  Even the &quot;good&quot; women (that is, the female members of the Conclave) can't resist Talon's lure.  I realize that, as part of his &quot;cover&quot; in society, Talon was trained to seduce women, but this was ridiculous.<br />There are other problems with the book as well.  Some characters and events are prominent but then disappear without having any real effect.  Alysandra, the woman who hardened his heart in the first book, appears very briefly and is quickly dealt with.  A chapter ends with Talon thinking that this particular character is &quot;a very dangerous man&quot; but then we don't hear anything about him again.  Also, once again Talon is almost perfect in his planning and abilities, except for one mistake he makes (trusting someone) that was so obvious that there's no way a man even half as competent as Talon has been shown to be would make that mistake.<br />So far, this has been nothing but complaints.  However, I did ultimately enjoy the book once I was got past these issues.  Talon has always been an interesting character, and he continues to be here.  In fact, he becomes more interesting as he sinks deeper and deeper into his role and fights desperately to keep real the good part of him.  He starts to have doubts about his revenge and whether it will be worth it.  The ending, while anticlimactic and predictable, is fitting for the story that's been told, as Talon comes full circle.  Feist definitely knows how to tell an exciting tale, and I read through the last 150 pages very quickly because I wanted to see how everything was resolved.  There is one bit left unresolved, though it's not something a sequel would fix.  There's one bit of closure that Feist just neglects, which is a shame.<br />While the book does end on a final note, there is the possibility of a sequel.  Be assured, though, that this particular story, the story of Talon of the Silver Hawk, is over.  Any further books will just be additions to his legend, or taking another of the characters and doing something with them.  This 2-book series is self-contained.  If I can't have just one book, I'm glad to have it limited to two.  Kudos to Feist for that much.<br />David Roy/>So far, this has been nothing but complaints.

Tracey Hickman and dragons go together...well, almost as well as Margaret Weis and Dragons.  So it's no surprise that one of the co-creators of the Dragonlance Chronicles has written another book involving dragons.  In this case, Mystic Warrior is also book one in yet another fantasy series (doesn't anybody write stand-alones anymore?).  The trick to making these series interesting is to have a world that the reader enjoys entering and learning more about.  Does that happen in this case?  I'm happy to say that Hickman, and his wife, Laura, have created a novel world using some standard fantasy tropes and turning them on their side a bit.  While some clich&eacute;s are still used (dwarves live underground, dragons are mean and nasty), they add just enough new stuff to make a fascinating first book.<br />Mystic Warrior is a tale of three different worlds.  All of them occupy the same space, but on a different plane, and communication between these worlds is only possible for certain people through what appear to be dreams.  On the faerie world, the inhabitants are under attack from hordes of satyrs and centaurs as their way of life is threatened.  On another, goblins scour the countryside looking for ancient machines that can be made to work, especially signs of the old Titans who inhabited the land before goblinkind.<br />On the human dominated world, Galen is a master ironworker along with the dwarf Cephas, who runs the forge.  Each year, the local religion runs what they call an \\"election,\\" where people who have some form of insanity are magically brought out and taken away.  Galen has had objects talking to him for years, but he has managed to avoid being present for the Election and has thus been passed over.  Not this year, however.  Taken away from his loving wife and his livelihood, he is forced into a war between five dragons who have marshaled their forces for 400 years, fighting insignificant battles over nothing.  But Galen discovers that the \\"insanity\\" that made him one of the elect is actually a form of magic, a magic linking all the worlds together, allowing one of the faeries, the \\"winged woman\\" of his supposed dreams, to aid him.  But will he survive long enough to learn what this magic is?<br />I loved the concept of these three linked worlds, especially when images are taken from one of the worlds and seen by other characters who have no idea how to interpret them.  Dwynwyn, who happens to be the winged woman Galen sees, has her own problems in the faerie realm dealing with her people's problems.  However, she and Galen are linked in some mysterious way, and they end up helping each other even though they don't understand what it is that they are seeing.  The main goblin character, Mimic, is also involved in some other, more obscure way.  The other characters never see him, but the war between the mechanical beings that he sets up for his ruler, the Dong Mehaj-Megong, to enjoy bears a striking resemblance to the war that Galen is currently fighting in.<br />The story takes us along the three storylines, jumping back and forth between them as we see the rise of Mimic from a lowly 4th class engineer to much higher in the goblin social structure.  We see Dwynwyn's attempts to safeguard her charge, the princess Aislynn from the onrushing hordes and a forced marriage to cement an alliance that would bring her people to the point of oblivion.  The Hickmans slowly start to merge the storylines as the book wears on.  At first, each story has its own chapter, using the chapter breaks to jump to something else.  As things become more tightly entwined, the breaks are more frenetic, jumping three or four times per chapter and ramping up the tension.  This effectively darkens the mood as we come closer to understanding how everything links together.  The pacing of the book is really nicely done in that sense.<br />This caused me to read the last half of the book at an accelerated rate, as I wanted to find out what happenednext.  Unfortunately, the first part of the book dragged at times.  I wasn't as interested in the characters as I could have been, especially Mimic and the Goblins.  The Goblin world is given short shrift in the beginning of the book, and thus the scenes that take place there aren't as interesting as the other two worlds.  It would have been nice to learn a little bit more about Goblin culture aside from the acquisition of mechanical artifacts and how possession of these is the ultimate status symbol.<br />The other problem is with some of the characterization.  It wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't that interesting either.  Galen tended to whine a lot right after he was selected, and while that may be understandable in real life, it's not that interesting to read about.  Tragget, the Inquisitor of one of the dragon's religions, and the person who saw Galen in his dreams, is a bit more intriguing, but the political fighting within the church just became boring.  It picks up when we start to learn the secret behind the religions, especially how all of the dragons interact.  After that, the book grabs you and doesn't let you go.<br />It's a shame that the beginning is such a struggle, as Mystic Warrior would be a first-rate book otherwise, and one I would recommend whole-heartedly.  Instead, it's just a very good book.  It will be interesting to see where the Hickmans go with this.  If the more boring set-up at the beginning of this book becomes necessary in subsequent books, I'll stand corrected.  That doesn't mean that it couldn't have been made more appealing, though.<br />David Royd next.  Unfortunately, the first part of the book dragged at times.

US	50332419	R1HXVMOGOE4M5O	0380977087	492544464	Talon of the Silver Hawk (Conclave of Shadows, Book 1)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Get that file out!	Revenge-fantasy books are almost a dime-a-dozen (and almost as clich&eacute;d as the phrase \\"dime-a-dozen\\").  I don't know how many books have the main protagonist be the last survivor of his people, out for revenge against the bad guys who murdered them, but I do know that there are many.  So when I heard that Raymond E. Fiest's Talon of the Silver Hawk was that kind of book, it already had one strike against it.  Style can make up for a lot of things, however, and thankfully Feist's style brings this up a few notches.  Not enough to make it an outstanding book, but enough to make it thoroughly enjoyable.  It is part 1 of a series (Conclave of Shadows), however, so be warned.  It is set in the Krondor universe, though it evidently takes place many years after the Riftwar, for those of you who are already fans of Feist.<br />Kieli is about to become a man by going through the vision quest that his people, the Orosini, use to mark the onset of adulthood.  After they have their vision, boys come back to the village, having received their adult name in their vision, and find out who their parents have chosen to be their bride.  However, Kieli doesn't have time for all this.  Right after his vision, he sees smoke from his distant village, runs there, and arrives just in time to almost be killed along with the rest of his people.  In fact, he's left for dead.  Found by a kindly yet secretive old man, who's much more then he appears to be, the newly christened Talon of the Silver Hawk goes through years of vigorous training to fulfill his duties to his rescuer.  He becomes a member of a super-secret organization, a secret weapon in a fight against evil.  He creates a new identity to ingratiate himself in high society in order to keep close to the evil-doers.  In his service to this organization, he will take his first steps on the road to vengeance for his family and his people.  But will he lose his own identity in the meantime?<br />It's a good thing that Feist can write an interesting yarn, because there is nothing in this book that's very original.  As I said, we've seen the \\"last member of a people out for revenge\\" story before.  We've also seen the \\"secret organization on the side of good but can do some shady things\\" before.  The setting is almost Dungeon & Dragons with the serial numbers filed off.  In fact, this organization almost reminded me of the Harpers in the Forgotten Realms series of books.  Thus, the book bears a heavy burden on its rise up the hill of quality.<br />Thankfully, Feist makes the book a lot of fun and Talon is actually quite the interesting person.  There is a bit of a culture clash between his own people and the society that he ends up trying to infiltrate.  He has to learn a lot of things, including the art of seduction.  His people don't believe in sex before marriage, but the character he becomes has to become a lady's man.  His first two \\"conquests\\" actually conquer him, and they couldn't be any more different.  One's blond and beautiful and the other is brunette and kind of mousy.  He eventually doesn't avoid promiscuity, but he still has to be taught a harsh lesson in love and loss before he can be fully ready for his role.<br />The characters aren't really anything special (with the exception of Talon, of course).  They fulfill their roles admirably.  The duke is subtly evil rather than twirling his moustache, but then he's only the ultimate goal of the series, not for this book.  The main villain for the book, Raven, doesn't get much characterization at all.  It doesn't really detract from the book, however, since it makes it almost a force that Talon is fighting against.<br />There are both good and bad things in the structure of the book.  The good thing to mention is an interesting stylistic choice.  Every chapter starts with a one sentence paragraph, along the lines of \\"Talon waited.\\"  Most of them are two words, though occasionally there are more, like \\"Talon sipped his wine.\\"  I don't know why this style intrigued me so much, but I really got a kick out of it.  The main problem I had with the book, however, is that Talon almost seemed too perfect.  He rarely makes a mistake, and when he does he's able to rectify it pretty quickly.  This isn't so much the case when he's being trained, but it certainly is afterward.  He's a great hunter, bowman, swordsman, he has ladies falling all over him (once he's in society).  It just doesn't appear to be a lot of work for him.<br />As I said, the only time this doesn't happen is his training, which actually does take up a large portion of the book.  I started out thinking that it was too drawn out and much more could have been glossed over in favour of an interesting story afterward, but the more I read, the more I was intrigued.  There are almost sub-stories in the whole thing, the most interesting being his doomed dalliance with a fellow student.  After it was over, I was glad it all had been included.  We learn bits and pieces about the Conclave of Shadows as Talon does, and it makes it more interesting.<br />Ultimately, I just have to say that this is a fun book.  That's the only reason that I'm giving it four stars, as going strictly by quality, I'd have to say it's between three and four. I'm glad I read it, and I'm eagerly devouring book two now.<br />David Roywhy this style intrigued me so much, but I really got a kick out of it.

US	50332419	R3545USBOW8AI7	0595752314	852164963	Face of a Stranger	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Heroes and the wannabes who love them	Dan Roentsch's Face of a Stranger is a strange little book.  Ostensibly, it's about heroes and what it takes to be one.  What's it like to do something for somebody, knowing that you won't survive to see the reaction?  The book's main protagonist, Maric, has to deal with this issue both in the abstract (he's dreaming about heroes) and in real life.  It's actually a very interesting take on the whole issue, but it's marred by extraneous material and some rather bland characters.<br />Living in a 24th century Martian colony of Edom, run by the dictatorial Eric Sheel, Maric holds a secret.  A plague has infected the city ever since, and the only man with a cure was Maric's father, Harold Sevillus.  Before he died, Sevillus implanted a secret message in Maric's brain, a message that Sheel is convinced is the cure.  Unfortunately, it's locked up tight in Maric's memory, where even he can't access it.  Sheel takes Maric in as his ward, keeping a close eye on him and trying desperately to unlock the secret.  This message seems to be invading Maric's dreams, as he has continuous images of 20th century heroes in all walks of life.  The book begins with Maric dreaming he's a cop who gives his life to bring down a clock-tower sniper.  As Maric gets older, the dreams get worse and he has to figure out what they mean.  But the message is more then either Maric or Sheel ever bargained for.  In deciphering everything, Maric has to make a decision: to be a true hero, or to be forever in Sheel's clutches.<br />The main problem with the book is that none of the characters are exceptionally interesting.  Maric's quest to discover more about himself should keep the reader enthralled, but more than once I found myself tiring of his whining and wanting him to get on with it.  He's indecisive, and I just wanted to reach through the pages of the book and throttle him, telling him to get off his duff and do something.  Roentsch uses Maric to discuss what a true hero is, and it's not just somebody who sacrifices his or her life for a cause.  Sometimes, it comes down to making a tough choice, a choice that can force someone into a very bad situation.  When Maric is mulling this over, he actually starts to become interesting.  But then he starts interacting with other characters and his less interesting personality traits manifest themselves again.<br />None of the other characters are any better.  Sheel is rather stereotypical as the villain of the piece.  He threatens, he cajoles his men, and he has moves quickly from being agreeable to being harsh with Maric as the mood hits him.  Ursina, Sheel's daughter and Maric's lover, is much too much like any other rich man's daughter in stories like these:  flighty, demanding, pouty and, ultimately, won over (for no apparent reason in this case).  Joey, Maric's childhood friend and one of Sheel's security officers, doesn't do much to enthrall either.  Krace seems to be a plot device more then a character, forcing Maric to make his first real choice but ultimately not distinguishing herself otherwise.  It's an interesting choice, but she doesn't bring much to it.<br />And then there's Kelby.  He's actually not that bad, but he (and Krace) are part of a superfluous chapter that really brings the book to a screeching halt, something that's not healthy in such a short book.  Kelby is one of Maric's professors, and also greatly critical of Sheel.  He has some interesting exchanges with Maric, but the chapter where Maric and Krace are taking their final exams just seems completely out of place.  In it, Kelby has a long internal monologue about Maric and Krace, commenting on their abilities and how they've done in his course.  He then starts to think about how much he's growing infatuated with Krace, and how she appears interested in Maric.  This brings on a lot of anger with Maric, but it ultimately doesn't go anywhere.  I guess this was supposed to set up Krace in the reader's mind for what happens later in the book, but it doesn't really do that.  Instead, it made me think this was too much of a side road to go down and I wanted to get back to the main one.<br />I don't want to dump on the book too much.  It's apparently Roentsch's first, and it does show a lot of promise.  The idea of the book is wonderful, and Maric truly is a \\"different\\" kind of hero.  This is mainly due to the fact that Maric is trying to discover what a hero is and what he would do in this situation.  He truly doesn't know and he's floundering.  The ideas and themes discussed are interesting and I'm glad I read them.  Roentsch's prose isn't too bad for a first effort, either, with only the occasional clunky bit. The same goes for his plotting and pacing.  The only problems there were the above mentioned chapter and the fact that the climax of the book seemed much too sudden for what led up to it.<br />Still, Face of a Stranger is a worthwhile read.  It's short and it's promising.  I'd like to see if Roentsch can improve on it.  He has his themes down pat, and if his next book is as interesting as this one was, then he should have a winner, as long as he works on the characterization issues.  Improve the pacing and he'd have a home run.  Give it a look if you find it.<br />David Royk, but it doesn't really do that.

Stephen Cole thanks Agatha Christie's daughter in the acknowledgements of Ten Little Aliens, and well he should.  While I have not read Ten Little Indians (or, as it's known now, And Then There Were None), I know enough about it to recognize a pastiche when I see one.  The question is, is it a good one?  While there is an entire 46 page experimental section that makes the reader work a bit too hard, it is overall an exciting and suspenseful mystery in space and well worth a read.<br />An elite group of soldiers is on a training mission inside a burned out planetoid when things start to go wrong.  They find a control room with ten alien corpses captured at the moment of an extremely violent death, frozen in time.  They also find a blue police box, an old man, and two young people who shouldn't be there.  Then, people start dying.  The Doctor and his companions would like nothing better then to get back in the TARDIS and go somewhere else, but they appear to be blocked by an energy barrier of some sort.  The Doctor has to use every wit he has to figure out what is going on.  What is the horrifying secret of the planetoid, and will anybody survive to find it?  And why does a alien corpse disappear every time a soldier dies?  And could one of the soldiers know more then he/she is telling about all of this?<br />Ten Little Aliens is a classic &quot;we're all trapped and people are starting to die!&quot; suspense romp, and at times it shows too many of the clich&eacute;s.  Each character is given a potential reason for being the traitor and clues point first to one then another of the soldiers.  It also has some Doctor Who clich&eacute;s, as the Doctor and companions are first suspected to be the bad guys, but circumstances (and the Doctor's vastly superior mind getting ahead of everybody else) force them to enlist the Doctor's help in figuring out what is going on.  The soldiers start out as stereotypical grunts (though elite ones) and don't usually move much beyond that point with a couple of exceptions.<br />The book works so well, though, that I didn't mind the clich&eacute;s.  The book started with the soldiers, and I had trouble getting into it, but when they reached the planetoid and things started happening, I forgave Cole a bit.  He takes these clich&eacute;s and turns them into something quite suspenseful and interesting.  He gives the soldiers just enough character to make us feel a little bit when one of them dies.  Of course, he has to do that or else the traitor part of the plot wouldn't work, as we wouldn't care who it was (or, alternately, we'd pick out the traitor because he/she is the only one *with* a personality).  Cole really pours on the atmosphere, so much that you almost feel like you're in a cave, feeling the oppressive waves washing over you.  It's almost enough to make you feel uncomfortable.<br />Cole manages to get the main characters dead-on, with only a quibble or two.  The first quibble is that the Doctor doesn't really appear to be that close to his regeneration (this book takes place very close to the time where he regenerates into the Second Doctor, and he has previously shown the signs of this body's age).  He certainly acts like an old man, not being able to do a lot physically and getting out of breath, but we don't really see the impending regeneration coming.  Previous books set in this time period have hinted at this, which makes this book stand out.  It's not a problem with the book itself, however, just a problem with where it is in the series.  I loved Polly's canary yellow space suit, though it's convenient that the Doctor would have one that just fits her personality.<br />There is one aspect of the book that really brings it to a screeching halt, however interesting the concept is.  At one point, all of the characters put on visors that hook them into the neural network, so they can keep in contact.  The entire chapter becomes similar to a &quot;choose your own adventure,&quot; except that it's a &quot;choose whose viewpoint you want to follow.&quot;  You end up reading all of the sections anyway (which is extremely clever on Cole's part, making sure it all ties together), but you're hopping from page to page, and I'm not sure I did get them all.  This goes on for 46 pages, where each short section ends with something like &quot;if you wish to see this from the Doctor's viewpoint, go to page 200.&quot;  It makes the reader really work, and I found it really dragged the pace of the novel down.  It's interesting because they can all get some sense of each other's thoughts, but ultimately I think it detracts from the book.<br />Other than that, though, Ten Little Aliens is a taut thriller with an exciting climax.  The characters grow beyond their clich&eacute;s to be interesting, and the plot will keep you going until the end.  I guess the reason why clich&eacute;s exist is because they started out really good, and can be good again when done right.  Stephen Cole has done it, though he teeters on the edge a little bit.  Check it out.

I don't care if it's a biological impossibility.  I want to do it.  What could possibly spark a reaction like that in me?  I just finished Tatooine Ghost, a Star Wars novel written relatively recently but not part of the New Jedi Order series.  Instead, it takes place a few years after Return of the Jedi and the Imperials are still stomping around.  Stormtroopers!  Imperial Walkers!  Jawas!  Tusken Raiders!  This book has everything.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  Of course I'm being serious.  Don't look at me that way.  I have been reading and enjoying the New Jedi Order series, and I thought it was safe to leave the past in the past.  Then I read this book.<br />The best thing about Tatooine Ghost is that it is a bridge between the old movies and the new trilogy.  I really loved the concepts of the new movies but really disliked how Lucas handled them.  This book takes those concepts and runs with them, showing us exactly what those stories should have been as they reach across the years and touch Anakin's daughter.  Leia finds a journal left behind by Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother, as she records entries that she hopes one day Anakin will read.  Leia sees her grandmother and finds another side of Anakin, a side showcased by a mother's love.  Elements of Episodes 1 and 2 are woven through the narrative as Han &amp; Leia meet up with some of Anakin's old friends.  Some of them don't believe what they've heard about how Anakin became an evil monster.  Others accept it but don't let it soil their memories of him.  All of this comes at a time where Leia is going through a crisis.  She refuses to even think of having children with the possibility that they could turn out to be like their grandfather.  She has refused to forgive him or understand what made him who he ultimately was.  Through the events in this novel, she slowly comes to terms with it.<br />The characterization is beautiful.  The characters in this novel are not older like they are in the new series, and their sense of adventure is palpable.  The book is full of the swashbuckling action, narrow escapes, and banter between the regulars that the original movies showcased.  Stormtroopers wander around in their white armour, Jawas hungrily scrounge for droids and other machinery, and Tusken Raiders try to kill everybody who invades their desert domain.  It showcases everything I loved about the originals, and makes the new series pale in comparison.  I'd forgotten how cool the Empire was as an enemy.  This is the Han and Leia that we grew up with, and I didn't realize how much I had missed them until I saw them in action again.  Han's still a scoundrel and a smuggler-at-heart while Leia's the tough but sophisticated woman who will do what is necessary for the New Republic, despite not really liking it.<br />The book also serves as a bridge in the novel series as well.  It references all the books around it, from The Truce at Bakura to The Courtship of Princess Leia, as well as Stackpole &amp; Allston's X-Wing series.  It connects Leia's reticence toward having children to the fact that they end up having three.  It clarifies why Han is helping the New Republic after he grows to loathe the government in Courtship.  Anybody who has read my Star Trek reviews knows how I hate unnecessary continuity references.  You'd think I would hate this book because it is full of it.  But I didn't.  I luxuriated in all of the stuff I used to love but thought was gone.  I loved how it clarified and examined things, and how it brought all of the movies together.  It could not have been written before The Phantom Menace and The Attack of the Clones was produced, but it filled a need that had clearly been there since the beginning of the Star Wars book franchise way back with Zahn's Heir to the Empire.<br />Enough gushing.  I do have to say that Tatooine's Ghost dragged in the middle a little bit.  The endless treks through the wasteland,the description of needing water and how they were trying to keep from collapsing started to get old after a while.  There were also a few too many in-jokes about how stupid stormtroopers acted in the original movies.  The exchanges between the troop commander and his squad as he tries to show them the new, intelligent way to do things was a bit over the top.<br />You know what?  I didn't care.  My heroes were back.  They weren't older, more seasoned, and slightly boring.  The Empire was back.  I don't care how dumb they could be.  Stormtroopers would kick the Yuuzhan Vong rears.  Denning's writing made me so awash in nostalgia, I would have forgiven him anything.  So it's a good thing that he made a wonderful book as well.  If you're a Star Wars fan, check Tatooine Ghost out.  You'll be glad you did.<br />David Royand, the description of needing water and how they were trying to keep from collapsing started to get old after a while.

US	50332419	R3SHAOH4VHPK24	0345428587	706445147	Balance Point (Star Wars, The New Jedi Order #6)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Light, dark...what's the difference?	Up until now, the Star Wars:  The New Jedi Order series has been cosmic in scope, with characters moments taking place on a backdrop of world after world falling to the villainous Yuuzhan Vong.  With Balance Point, Kathy Tyers gives us a bit of a break from that.  Sure, the Vong are still ravaging every planet in sight, but the events of the book are limited to one planet with all of the characters involved being there.  It's a bit more intimate in scope in one other way, too: the main point of the story is young Jacen Solo's quest to discover just what his place in the Force is.  It's a nice change of pace, but the presentation is a little boring and the characters sort of lie there on the page.<br />I have to admire Tyers' attempt to do a Star Wars novel with very little starship combat, though there is a fair share of juking and jinking to be done.  However, what we're left with flies off the page like a Tie Fighter with one solar panel missing.  It's sad because this is a novel that sets up a lot of the books to come (or appears to, anyway).  Coruscant is threatened, Han and Leia may be back together and Han is acting more like himself after what happened in the last few books.  Jacen comes to a crossroads and appears to make the correct decision, and there's plenty of personal action.  Yet for some reason, none of this stuff seems to move.  Droma gets very little characterization, and what there is of it is carried over from Luceno's novels (Hero's Trial and Jedi Eclipse).  He is clearly not taking Chewbacca's place, but I can't tell if that's because he's not supposed to or because he's just characterized badly.<br />The regulars are decent, but bland.  The reunion between Han and Leia should be electrifying, but it just limps along (granted, they are in decontamination, but still...).  It's nice to see them working together and caring about each other, but it would have been nice to have better dialogue for them.  Jacen's relationship with his sister, Jaina, takes a nosedive as Jacen reveals that he won't use the Force, even to rescue their mother.  Thankfully, Jacen realizes that not using the Force but relying on others to use it is kind of hypocritical, but then he never does anything with that realization.  When Jacen makes his final decision about his destiny, it all comes about in a fairly clich&eacute;d way, with a loved character being in danger forcing him to decide.  The answer is, of course, predictable.<br />We are introduced to Warmaster Tsavong Lah, a Vong who appears to be an ongoing character in this one, as well as meeting Nom Anor yet again.  Anor is actually getting a bit irritating, so one can only hope that he will soon be vaped accidentally by one of his own troops.  He's a spy, infiltrating the New Republic in various guises, showing up in book after book in another role, serving the Vong god of Tricks rather then the god of Violence.  While it looks like this dynamic could be interesting in future books, Anor as a character has never achieved anything more then reader annoyance in my book.<br />As I said before, the plot is a lot more intimate and less star-spanning then previous books, which does make for a tighter book.  I really liked the way the book didn't jump all over the known galaxy and stayed in one place pretty much.  Of course, it's a stretch that they all end up in the same place yet again, but it's a given with the Star Wars books, so I should probably stop complaining about it.  I also really liked the relationship between Mara and Anakin, and to a lesser extent, Luke.  A momentous event in Luke and Mara's relationship occurs in this book, and I hope it leads to even more interesting things.  In the meantime, though, Mara and Anakin make a wonderful pair. Mara's the experienced one and Anakin is eager to learn at her feet.  He learns a bit about espionage as well as more about using the Force. He's also shown to be a bit of a hot shot, and I hope this leads to a lesson in future books.<br />All in all, Balance Point is a perfectly acceptable Star Wars novel.  It has some excitement and some good character moments.  I just wish there had been more of them.  If you're reading the series, it's not really one you can skip (though hopefully future books that rely on it will tell you enough about it if you do decide to pass it by).  It's also good enough to get through if you have to.  But if you're picking and choosing, give this one a miss.<br />David Royr />All in all, Balance Point is a perfectly acceptable Star Wars novel.

While the facts of history never change, our interpretations of those facts are forever mutable.  Doctor Who, being a time-travel series, has the capability of examining history that few series have.  While our time-traveling heroes are always worried about changing the past, we never really hear them discuss what might happen if the past starts changing around them.  Are there any such things as absolutes in history?  History 101 addresses that issue with style and flair.<br />The Doctor, Fitz, and Anji are in 1937 Paris having a holiday.  Along with the tourist attractions, they decide to visit the Paris Exposition, similar to the World's Fair and where every European country has an exhibit.  Upon arriving at the Spanish exposition, they discover a vivid painting: Guernica, by Picasso.  Only it doesn't quite have the passion and the effect that they remember it having.  In fact, the copy of Sartre's The Age of Reason that Fitz is reading has a cover reproduction of the painting, and it has much more of an effect than the real one sitting in front of them.  How can a copy have more of an effect then the original?<br />It seems that something strange is going on (isn't there always?).  The events at Guernica don't appear to have happened quite the way everybody knows they did.  But then again, maybe they did?  The uncertainty of this prompts the Doctor and his companions to travel back to this horrible event.  The Doctor wants Fitz to witness it first-hand so that he can report what actually happened.  Is this an alternate reality?  Or is somebody warping the real one?  The Doctor and Anji end up in Barcelona 5 months before Fitz arrives at Guernica (isn't time-travel wonderful?) and have to wait for him.  The TARDIS has decided to shut down and monsters appear to be roaming the streets.  Are these linked?  And will the Doctor and Anji survive to meet up with Fitz again, or will they get caught up in a bloody civil war where no side has a monopoly on the truth and all sides want to kill the other.<br />History 101 is Halliday's first novel, but don't let that stop you.  It's a wonderful book that keeps you guessing at all levels.  It's also not one that you will breeze through, as Halliday discusses all the issues mentioned above.  While there have been Doctor Who books and episodes dealing with historical settings, this is the first one I can remember actually examining the whole concept of history.  Is it possible to know everything about historical events?  Those trying to catalogue the truth could go crazy trying to decide if it is, especially when propaganda is streaming forth from every avenue.<br />Halliday uses the time-honoured Who tradition of separating everybody so that each side can be shown.  While the Doctor and Anji are ostensibly together, they spend a lot of time apart interacting with other characters, whether they be foreign journalists, Bolshevik agitators or Spanish Nationalists.  Fitz meets up with the mysterious Sasha, a Russian who knows a lot more then he's telling.  Sasha helps Fitz get to Guernica (even though Fitz is his prisoner at one point) and seems to be serving a different master then the Communists.  Halliday handles the myriad characters very well, making each one at least somewhat distinctive.  There were so many sides in this conflict (plus the two additions to the historical line-up), that it would normally be hard to tell who was doing what.  Despite the fact that some allegiances change, I still had little trouble doing so.  A credit to Halliday's work.<br />The main cast is also great.  Anji has a couple nice asides to the Doctor about his being able to steer the TARDIS at times yet not being able to get her back to 21st century Earth. Then again, I didn't realize that she was trying to get back, and it's unclear whether she just wants to go home or go back for a visit.  The asides are wonderfully portrayed but they came out of left field abit for me.  The Doctor takes more of a part in the proceedings then he has in the past.  He's much less passive (though he does spend a bit too much time brooding about the TARDIS and how she's not working).  Fitz is great, though.  He really comes into his own, the dialogue with Sasha crackling, especially when he realizes that there's something anachronistic about Sasha's knowledge.  He alternately feels offended that Sasha's lying to him and then sheepish when he realizes that he's lying to Sasha as well.<br />Even better is how the regulars react when events start happening around them.  Barcelona explodes in factional fighting, and all three of them have to adapt and protect themselves.  In the fighting, the Doctor finally has to deal with what's going on behind the scenes.  It's interesting how there isn't really a \\"villain\\" in this book, especially with all the other violence going on around the characters.<br />History 101 is not an exciting romp, with action filling every page and keeping the reader entranced.  Instead, it's a bit more introspective, its ideas keeping you wanting to read \\"just a little bit more.\\"  It's a fascinating take on history, and it's a great adventure for the Doctor Who fan.

US	50332419	RPRGX2T7HP699	0743445600	25499919	Mission Gamma Book One: Twilight (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Mission Gamma) (Bk. 1)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Deep Space Nine gets back to exploring	One of the draws to the television show Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was the fact that the wormhole passage that was right next to the station enabled exploration to a completely uncharted area of space, the Gamma Quadrant.  While the show had its fair share of episodes exploring this area, they spent more time with Bajor, and, subsequently, with the Dominion War.  In fact, in later seasons, the wormhole was closed and the Gamma Quadrant was unreachable.<br />Now that the series is over and the books have taken over the grand &lt;b&gt;Deep Space Nine&lt;/b&gt; story, it's time to open up the exploration again.  Twilight, by David R. George III, is the beginning of a four-part story which details this.  It's a huge novel with a very large story to tell, one which it tells effectively for the most part.  However, it's a bit bloated with so much information, and George's occasionally heavy prose and repetition make this problem worse.  Still, it's a great read for any DS9 fan.<br />I have never seen a 500 page Trek novel before, but George has a lot of ground to cover.  I'm glad to say that he doesn't waste much of it, though the book could have been trimmed a bit here and there.  George's style is very workmanlike and enjoyable.  One thing it is not is boring.  However, he does repeat himself at times, seemingly to emphasize points that he thinks the reader should definitely remember.  Kira's attainder against practicing her religion gets mentioned many times.  Other times, repetition is not the problem, but heavy-handed prose is.  George allows his characters to get very introspective, but sometimes he goes a bit too far, with pages going by with nothing but a character thinking.  I really loved the book, but I found it dragging at times because of this.<br />The main place where this happens is on the planet where the pulse originated.  George does a wonderful job examining his characters, especially Vaughn.  Vaughn has a lot of soul-searching to do.  His relationship with his daughter is non-existent, as she blames him for her mother's death and for abandoning her afterward in his own guilt.  He has always dreamed of exploring, but most of his career has been spent fighting various menaces.  He has a lot of regrets in his past, and he ends up reliving a lot of them on the planet.  While this was fascinating stuff, it began to get tedious as the pages roll by.  Sometimes, I just wanted Vaughn to shut up and get on with it.  There are some passages for Dax like this as well, and each character has just a bit too much introspection for my taste.  The book just feels a bit bloated because of this.<br />George captures the other characters wonderfully, getting to the heart of the various conflicts between them.  The ongoing tension between ch'Thane and his family is beautifully drawn, finally extracting a promise that he never wanted to make to his fellow Andorians.  Ro and Quark tap dance around their feelings, making a wonderful contrast with Quark's relationship with Odo in the series.  Kira, and Kassidy are both equally well-done.  Taran'atar, the Jem'Hadar warrior who has been assigned by Odo to observe the Alpha Quadrant and learn something, has some wonderful scenes as he moves out of the Operations area and tries to observe the rest of the station.  The only characters who are given short shrift are Bashir and Nog (who does get a wonderful scene with Taran'atar), but that's to be expected.  George has already tried to pack the book full.  However, if the book had to be this big, it would have been nice to chop some of the bloat and give it to these two.<br />Twilight is a wonderful beginning to the \\"Mission: Gamma\\" series, and a wonderful addition to the Deep Space Nine mythos.  I'm loving the continuation of the television series, and there hasn't been a bad book yet.  I'm hoping the other three books in the series are just as good, if not better.<br />David Roywith his daughter is non-existent, as she blames him for her mother's death and for abandoning her afterward in his own guilt.

US	50332419	R13IIM7808R3HM	067102129X	663353360	Captain's Blood (Star Trek)	Books	3	5	9	N	N	Kirk is the just-off-center of the universe!	The name \\"William Shatner\\" on a novel can strike fear into the hearts of a lot of Trekkies (though I know some are fans).  I gave up on his Mirror-universe series because it was just getting more and more dull and making Kirk more and more the center of the universe.  It also seemed like every new book jumped on the bandwagon of the latest events on the television series, rather then telling its own story (Janeway (ok, a Mirror-Janeway) shows up after Voyager premieres on television, etc).  Each book also contained a lot of new television series continuity.  Since I know Shatner doesn't pay that much attention to the current series, it just adds to the \\"were these books ghost-written?\\" mystique.<br /><br />That being said, when I heard that Shatner had a new Kirk book out, I decided to check it out.  I was aware of Captain's Peril, but it sounded like a self-contained adventure that didn't interest me that much, so I avoided it.  Captain's Blood, however, dealt with Spock and the Romulans.  Anybody who has read my review of Star Trek: Nemesis knows that I love Romulans, so I had to check this one out.  Captain's Blood is a direct sequel to Nemesis (there's that \\"jumping on the bandwagon of the current series\\" again) that deals with the fallout of Shinzon's aborted coup in that movie.  So was I mercilessly teased into reading yet another Kirk-lovefest?  In a way.  I found it better than the Mirror-Universe saga, but it did suffer from some of the same faults.<br /><br />Captain's Blood isn't quite as Kirk-centric as the Mirror-Universe books (though that's admittedly not saying much).  Sure, Kirk is still the center of the action.  Sure, Kirk gets to be all self-righteous to Picard and Janeway (though Picard is supposed to be his friend) and talk about how things were different (and better) in his day.  Thankfully, that last bit is toned down to just a couple of comments, but it still grated at times.  You would think that somebody who uses the current continuity to this extent would try not to denigrate it at the same time.  However, Picard and his crew are fairly well characterized.  Riker suffers a little bit from being treated too much like a new captain.  Shatner seems to be forgetting that Riker was pretty well-rounded as first officer on the Enterprise under Picard, instead portraying him as a bit tentative and needing some of Kirk's instruction.  Janeway has turned into a real hard-case, even more so than she was on Voyager.<br /><br />Still, given all that, I have to say that the book isn't too bad.  It's a quick read that grabs you and makes you say \\"just one more chapter.\\"  Shatner does have a way with action scenes, especially with Kirk and McCoy's escape from the ore processing plant (though this is one of the few times that Kirk actually seems superhuman).  The main problem with the book, aside from some of the characterization issues, is the horribly abrupt ending.  The plot is moving along, we find out who is behind the possible civil war, Kirk is able to stop the individual, and then it just ends with a totally different \\"to be continued.\\"  The villain escapes, an epilogue segues into the next book, and we never hear anything more about the Romulan civil war.  What is it with the Romulans being treated like window-dressing?  I WANT MY ROMULANS!!!<br /><br />Ahem.  Sorry.  The lack of Romulans (despite their presence in the background of almost the entire book) is not my main problem with the ending.  Along with the abruptness, we also find out that this is yet another ongoing series by Shatner.  While it isn't absolutely necessary to have read Captain's Peril (there's a massive infodump about it right in the middle of a tension-filled scene, so don't worry), it's still the first cog in what could be another long-winded \\"epic\\" by Shatner.  In fact, it seems that Captain's Peril is going to be another Ashes of Eden, a seemingly self-contained adventure that ends up starting a monstrosity.  I hope history doesn'trepeat itself, but I'm not holding my breath.<br /><br />In the meantime, however, I'll give the next Shatner book a chance.  It didn't annoy me as much as the Mirror-Universe books did.  Ask me again in a book or two (or three?).  Consider this a moderate recommendation.<br /><br />David Royding my breath.

Are you tired of generic fantasy?  If you are, and you saw a book titled &lt;b&gt;The Knight&lt;/b&gt; in your bookstore travels, would you pick it up?  Maybe, but probably not.  However, you then glance at the author's name, and you see \\"Gene Wolfe.\\"  If you're a big fantasy or science fiction fan, that name may be enough to make you pause. You've heard so many raves about this man's writing that you look a bit closer.  You read the dust jacket.  What's this?  A story about a young man in his teens \\"transported to a magical realm\\" where he is transformed into a man and works at becoming a knight?  What is this?  Do they seriously expect us to buy a book so mundane?<br />Given all of that, &lt;b&gt;The Knight&lt;/b&gt; has a lot going against it.  But it has one major thing going for it that gets past all that: Gene Wolfe.  I have never read any of Wolfe's books, but he has such a reputation among the SF crowd that I decided to give this book a chance.  Am I glad I did.  &lt;b&gt;The Knight&lt;/b&gt; takes all of the cliches of the sword &amp; sorcery genre and turns them on their heads.  The boy, Able, does not turn into the manly hero overnight, as normally happens.  He does not meet the normal wizards and other bad folk that lesser writers employ as villains.  Able is on a quest for a magic sword, which he must steal from a dragon.  However, he refuses to wield any sword until he wins this one, and he does not become a master swordsman in one fell swoop.  In fact, he gets by on a little luck and a lot of help from his friends, especially a dog that is not really a dog.  This, coupled with the wonderful Wolfe prose that I've heard so much about makes this book a real winner.<br />The book is written in first person, a letter or story written to his older brother in the \\"real\\" world.  It's unclear when Able wrote this, but he obviously hasn't grown up too much, or at least he hasn't gained much skill in writing.  He goes back and forth at times, omitting important details other times.  He gets petulant, and the point of view is obviously that of a boy trying hard to be a man.  Lesser writers would use this as an excuse for bad writing, but Wolfe's intentions are clear, winking at the reader and showing us that he is definitely doing this intentionally.  Able is an unreliable narrator, seeming not to know when he's forgetting some of the more interesting stuff.<br />Wolfe captures Able beautifully, making us care about what happens to him despite him being fairly unlikable.  He can treat people horribly, often without realizing it.  This is especially true of two of his \\"slaves,\\" Fire Aelf women who revel in trying to entice him into forgetting all of this Knight business and instead have fun with them.  While he is successful in resisting them, in doing so he often treats them worse then even slaves deserve.  He also forgets about his \\"dog\\" Gylf at times, even when Gylf has been away for very long periods of time.  In fact, the only two people he treats with much respect at all are the two knights who assist him on the road to knighthood: Sir Garvaon and Sir Ravd.  Ravd teaches him what knightly qualities are, including what it takes to actually be a knight.  Garvaon begins to teach him swordcraft.<br />The minor characters are great, even though we have to peer through Able's narrative to see them.  Garvaon and Ravd are honorable men who have an illustrious shine put on them by Able's words, but even the lesser characters are distinctive and well-characterized.  Gylf is one of the best, when he's willing to talk that is (he won't talk if anybody else is around).  He has a small sense of humour and is very plain, but he is vicious when his master needs protecting.  It's unclear what he truly is, though he is definitely a creature from a different realm (there being seven, one on top of another, in the mythos Wolfe creates), but beyond that we don't know.  Wolfe keeps him simple but mysterious, and I hope we find out more about him in the second book.<br />For a book like this, there is surprisingly little action in it.  With the exception of one battle (and even that is truncated), there is very little description of the various battles in which Able is involved.  Instead, Able tells all of these stories in hindsight, giving us the effect of them without the actual battle scenes.  I don't know whether Wolfe is showing us how these scenes are ultimately uninteresting or if it's a conceit of Able's narration, but I found it intriguing how the text shies away from the subject.

With the exception of one battle (and even that is truncated), there is very little description of the various battles in which Able is involved.  Instead, Able tells all of these stories in hindsight, giving us the effect of them without the actual battle scenes.

US	50332419	R3JU9FMAF0XL9U	0151004498	30962648	The Graveyard Game	Books	5	1	1	N	N	And I thought the world was ugly *now*!	Four books into Kage Baker's science fiction series about \\"The Company,\\" and things are getting quite interesting.  The Graveyard Game is yet another standout addition to a series that doesn't stop, as we learn even more sinister secrets about the Company and how it handles the immortals that it has created.  Baker's writing seems to have matured, tackling an even broader story that encompasses not only the personal (as she has done superbly before) but also the politics.  She takes bits and pieces that have only been hinted at in previous books and ties them up, leaving us with even further questions about what is going to happen.  With three more books left in the series (and the next one is coming out this year!), the situation is wide open.  I love being along on this ride, and part of me wishes it wouldn't stop.  With The Graveyard Game, Baker continues the roll she's been on since the hiccup that is Sky Coyote (and I say this to indicate that I don't necessarily like everything she's written).<br />The Graveyard Game opens in 1996, with one of Mendoza's best friends (Lewis) wondering what happened to her, especially after he briefly encounters a version of her that was inexplicably thrust forward from 1862 (before she ran away).  He tries to recruit Joseph into his search, who is more than willing to join.  It seems he thinks he saw Mendoza and her lover in 1923, plus he feels responsible for her.  Years pass as their investigation continues, and they uncover more and more dirt on the Company.  Why do some operatives disappear with no record?  Why, as the 24th century approaches (this book actually ends in the late 23rd century), do secrets become even more impenetrable?  Why is there little record of what happens leading up to 2355?  Why does Mendoza's lover keep reappearing, and what is his connection to the Company?  And, most importantly to Lewis as events unfold, who are the people who seem to know about the immortals and also seem to know how to damage one?<br />Baker throws us a bit of a change-up in The Graveyard Game.  Despite there being a lot of personal interaction (especially between Lewis and Joseph) that Baker excels at as usual, the most interesting thing about the book is the world that Baker has created.  As time passes in great chunks, she is able to show us how much the world has changed, and it's not very pretty.  Britain has enforced veganism, personal interaction is almost forbidden.  The birth rate has plummeted as people spend more and more time paying attention to their inner child and not having any real ones.  It's against the law to do anything that might be bad for you (heaven forbid if you have a beer!).  People get around this by living in the wilds, or out on sailboats in international waters.<br />Every time the scene shifts years, Baker takes a bit of time to tell us what's going on in the world.  The best part, though, is that it's not as much of an infodump as it might be.  All of this is told in the context of telling us what Lewis is up to, or Joseph.  Many of the details slip out in the narrative.  Sometimes it's used to explain just what the other immortals are thinking, especially as we get nearer the time of \\"The Silence\\" in 2355.  They see this world as it approaches, and they have to wonder just what they are saving all of this stuff for.<br />Factions are starting to form inside the Company operatives, and many of them are just disappearing.  Joseph seems to know a bit about what is going on, but his investigations get increasingly dangerous.  He tries in vain to keep Lewis out of most of the danger, and watching Baker handle the relationship between these two is great.  Lewis is a bookish, Noel Coward type who is at home in a library.  He just won't let his investigation of Mendoza's lover go, despite Joseph's warnings.  Joseph is the same character we've known and loved in the previous books: sarcastic, intelligent, witty and dedicated.  You can tell that he feels deeply about Mendoza, almost like a father-figure (since he did recruit her into the Company) and he's increasingly horrified as he uncovers more and more about the Company he's serving.  He's also very loyal, both to Mendoza and his own father-figure who disappeared a long time ago.<br />The Graveyard Game features these two immortals at the expense of everybody else.  There are some other immortals in the book who are well-characterized, but they don't get the extensive treatment.  We do see some familiar figures from past books throughout the course of Joseph's search, and that's always a pleasure.  Baker handles them all deftly, giving us just enough information so that we think we know them without having to delve too deeply into them.  She also handle the switch from personal to action very well, with a vivid description of a battle between three immortals and a Roman unit that was obliterated in England in the 1st Century.<br />I can't say enough good things about The Graveyard Game, or this series in general.  You owe it to yourself to pick it up.  Don't let the second book get you down.  Just read it and absorb the Company politics, and then move on.  If you do, then you'll be rewarded with wonderful books like Mendoza in Hollywood and this one.<br />David Royabout Mendoza, almost like a father-figure (since he did recruit her into the Company) and he's increasingly horrified as he uncovers more and more about the Company he's serving.

US	50332419	R277CS1CE3F89Y	1930846118	475425031	Black Projects, White Knights: The Company Dossiers	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Some fascinating history of "The Company"	Fans of Kage Baker's \\"Company\\" novels may not realize that the series actually was first published in short story form.  As she states in her introduction to \\"Noble Mold,\\" this story was published in Asimov's magazine while In the Garden of Iden was still looking for a publisher.  After The Graveyard Game was published, she decided to collect a bunch of Company short stories from Asimov's (and they always appeared in Asimov's) into a book.  The result, along with three new stories and a new introduction, is Black Projects, White Knights.  These stories range from the mundane to the bizarre, but all have that distinctive Baker touch that makes them readable.<br />We are first introduced to all of the characters that will be featured in the coming stories, under the cover of a spy into the Company's records bringing up dossiers on all of the major players in the series (and the stories as well).  \\"The Hounds of Zeus\\" will eventually tie into the series itself (Baker has hinted as such), but for now it is a suitable summary of who everybody is.  We then get into the stories, and the wild ride begins.  As in most short story collections, there are some standouts and some weaker stories.  Surprisingly, I found the stories starring Mendoza to be among the lesser works, though they were still interesting.  She features in three of them (\\"Noble Mold,\\" \\"Lemuria Will Rise!\\", and \\"Hanuman\\"), but none of them spring off the page.  While the potential of these stories is surely there, I found the writing of the first two stories to be lacking (especially \\"Noble Mold, but it was her first story so it's excusable).<br />As usual, Joseph stars in the best stories, with \\"The Literary Agent\\" being the best of the bunch.  In this one, Joseph interacts with Robert Louis Stevenson during his three-day stint on a mountain in California where he almost died.  Joseph comes to see if he can get Stevenson to write a screenplay for him so that his \\"masters\\" can have an original work by him to film (it seems they've already adapted all of the books Stevenson has or will have written).  Baker captures Hollywood perfectly, with Joseph submitting the screenplay ideas and then having them rejected, or accepted with some \\"slight changes.\\"  The story is a riot from beginning to end and I couldn't stop laughing through all of it.  It's fast-paced and Baker captures the personalities perfectly.<br />An interesting addition to the Company mythos is a series of stories about Alec Checkerfield, a young boy living in a time near the \\"Silence\\" (2355, or the year that the Company is working toward, which nothing is known about what happens afterward).  Checkerfield's stories show us how ugly the world has become, where an adult can't even hug a child in public without a license for fear of being taken away as a possible child molester.  Alec is a young boy who doesn't know his place in the world.  His parents have left him (though there's some doubt that he's even their child) and he's being raised by his \\"father's\\" servants.  He has reprogrammed his electronic \\"child companion\\" so that he can break all of the social norms of current society.  He's very intelligent, and he's going to be a force to be reckoned with someday.  The book contains three stories about Alec at various stages of his growth, with the final one taking place when he's 16.  Baker obviously has plans for him, but I have no idea what they could be.  The stories themselves aren't that interesting other than in showing the future world, with the exception of \\"The Dust Enclosed Here.\\"  In this story, Alec meets a hologram of William Shakespeare in a museum.  Shakespeare's plays have been forbidden for being too violent, but his sonnets are well liked and they have created a semi-sentient hologram of him to entertain the public.  Alec comes in and gives old Will a lot more sentience then he bargained for.  The interplay between the two of them crackles and the story is witty yet slightly frightening.  It's another standout in the book.<br />Other stories give interesting insights into some of the characters we've seen in previous Company novels, giving some history to them and making them more complete (especially if you've read the stories before reading the books).  While I didn't think any of these stories stood out among the ones already mentioned, I thought they were interesting, well-written, and had some good characterization.  Baker is a great short story writer, and even the lesser efforts in this book are well worth reading.  The new stories are about extremely minor characters, and thus aren't quite as interesting as the rest.  The exception is \\"The Queen in Yellow,\\" which is a rollicking adventure of Lewis, the Literature Preservationist and friend of Mendoza, and his adventures in an Egyptian archeological dig in 1914.  There's a weird professor, an immortal woman controller who's not above using her wiles to get what she wants, and good old Lewis stuck in the middle.  Having just read The Graveyard Game, I found it interesting to hear a bit about Lewis' past, and Baker again excels in the characterization department.<br />If you're a fan of the Company books, Black Projects, White Knights is a valuable addition to the whole story.  You won't get any big insights into the ongoing plot, but you will get to see some of your favourite characters in some interesting situations, and you'll get to experience Kage Baker, the short story writer.  It's well worth the time and investment.<br />David RoyIt's another standout in the book.<br />Other stories give interesting insights into some of the characters we've seen in previous Company novels, giving some history to them and making them more complete (especially if you've read the stories before reading the books).

When most people think of World War II, they think of the fight against Nazism in Europe.  Even if they do consider the fight against Japan, most think of the US Marines jumping from one bloody island to another on their long march north.  Largely forgotten by many, there was a war in Asia as well.  Japan invaded China in 1937, starting 8 years of combat ranging from mountains of China to the jungles of Burma and other southeast Asian countries.  It wasn't a pretty campaign, but it was very important.<br />Donovan Webster has written a definitive account of this war from an American and British perspective.  The Burma Road covers the war from the American entrance into the war until its Japan's final collapse.  A large part of the book is focused on General Joseph Stillwell, or &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; as his men called him, but Webster does cover almost every aspect of it.  While the war in China is neglected for a long period of time, The Burma Road effectively shows us the blood, sweat and disease that dominated this campaign.  It's a fascinating book.<br />There is a bit of a framing story around the book, with Webster trying to walk the full length of the Burma Road, a road from Burma to China that was supposed to supply the Chinese and keep them in the war.  A large portion of northeast India is still restricted, especially from journalists, and Webster is unsuccessful in the beginning of his journey.  He then segues into the beginning of Stillwell's story, giving a brief summary of his career up until he gets assigned to the Southeast Asian sector of the war.  Notoriously under-supplied and undermanned, Stillwell is forced to make do with what he can to keep the Japanese out of India at all costs.  While Japan successfully invades Thailand and Burma and Stillwell is forced to slog through the jungles to escape, he manages to keep them from their ultimate goal.  He is less successful with the Chinese, however, forever clashing with China's leader, Chiang Kai-shek.  After three years of fighting both the Japanese and his own allies, Stillwell is finally relieved of command, despite his many successes.<br />While a large portion of the book is told through Stillwell's point of view, other areas are not neglected.  We hear a lot about the British army, especially the Chindit special forces (one whole chapter on their beginning plus numerous chapters when they are fighting alongside Stillwell's men) as well as the beginning of the world-famous &quot;Flying Tigers,&quot; a group of American pilots who had resigned their commissions so they could fight for China before the United States entered the war.  Their leader, Claire Chennault, later became a real thorn in Stillwell's side, siding with Kai-Shek in all of the battles between the two leaders.<br />The book follows a semi-chronological format, taking us from the beginning of Stillwell's involvement in the Asian theater of operations to the end of the war, but it does jump around a bit when it moves on to another subject.  It gets to a certain point in Stillwell's career and then backtracks to tell the beginning of Chindit operations, for example.  It also pauses to give brief biographies of major characters, such as the British General Orde Wingate.  This back and forth style does make it confusing at times, and there was one time reference that I swore didn't add up until I realized that Webster was talking about something else.  However, it does make the book feel even more comprehensive, as it seems to cover every conceivable angle of the war.<br />The one aspect of this where The Burma Road fails, however, regards China.  The constant lend-lease supply of goods to the Chinese is covered, the Chinese contribution to Stillwell's campaign is documented beautifully, and Chennault's Flying Tigers are represented.  On the other hand, other than a brief chapter near the end of the book and a few mentions in between, none of the fighting in China is actually discussed.  Webster spends a brief time discussing the decision to finally bring the Chinese Communists into the war, and makes a few small references to their savagery in fighting the Japanese.  Given the depth of the rest of the book, however, it feels very small.<br />That being said, though, The Burma Road is a very valuable resource for anybody wanting a general history of the Asian campaign in World War II.  It corrects some myths that have been fostered about the war.  One chapter takes special aim at the book and movie The Bridge Over the River Kwai.  It calls the book fictional with the movie being even worse.  Webster gives the real details behind the building of that bridge, and the railway in general.  He tells us how the Japanese mistreated not only the prisoners, but also their own men.<br />That's where The Burma Road excels: the details.  Webster doesn't pull any punches, telling us of the disease, leeches, poisoned water, the condition of the corpses, and other hardships that the valiant men who fought in this theater went through.  He even interviewed some of the Japanese soldiers who managed to survive the conflict, showcasing the ordeals they had to go through.  They were chronically under-supplied and often subsisted on nothing but small quantities of rice and bad water.  Webster gives us so much detail that you may not want to read this book over lunch.<br />I haven't read a better book on this subject, and I'm very glad I picked this up.  I couldn't put it down.  If you're a military history fan, I don't think you'll be able to either.  It's a book that the men who fought and died in the jungles deserve to have written about them.  It especially does old Vinegar Joe justice.<br />David Royr spends a brief time discussing the decision to finally bring the Chinese Communists into the war, and makes a few small references to their savagery in fighting the Japanese.

US	50332419	R2I82I4MTLL4TF	0805075615	641939565	In the Company of Soldiers: A Chronicle of Combat	Books	3	55	63	N	N	The story of a division at war	No matter what your feelings are about the Iraq war, there's no doubt that the men who were on the ground (and still are, for the most part) conducted themselves with great elan.  Rick Atkinson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of AN ARMY AT DAWN, took a break from writing the second book of the series to spend time with the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq, embedded for the Washington Post.  His new book, IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS, chronicles his time with the division.  While I found it an interesting book, I feel that it doesn't give what is promised.  Along with that, Atkinson periodically throws out some personal opinions in the middle of his reporting that I thought didn't go with the aim of the book (the story of a division in combat).<br />Atkinson has shown that he is a great writer who can really put the reader at the center of the action.  He doesn't pull any punches in this book either, vividly describing the dust and the blowing sand that literally covers everything. You can almost feel your own voice get raspy along with the soldiers as if you also suffer from the &quot;Kuwait crud.&quot;  Atkinson spent most of his time with General Patraeus, commander of the division, which allows him to show us all of the briefings and strategy sessions each day.  He gives us a great picture of Patraeus, who is facing his first combat command, showing us his uncertainty and determination.  When the first problems hit (mainly the weather, but also unforeseen Iraqi resistance, he begins to wonder at the estimate that this will be a quick war.  We also see his exhilaration when Iraqi resistance collapses after a couple of weeks of hard fighting.<br />As good a job as Atkinson does in his portrait of Patraeus, it brings up the main problem with IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS.  It spends too much time with the higher-ups and not enough time with the men in the field.  I understand that Atkinson had no real choice who he was embedded with, and that if he had been placed with the front-line troops, this book would have been about them.  However, the title (IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS) and the description of the book makes it out to be much more &quot;on the ground&quot; then it ends up being.  Most of the time the war is told through a series of reports.  It's interesting to see the agonizing in the control tent, but we don't get much of a feel for the men themselves.  During the lead-up to the battle, we do get a bit more of this, but even then the book is lacking input from the men &quot;down in the trenches.&quot;  We hear of the logistical problems faced by trying to get the division ready for battle at much too short notice, but we feel removed even from those as we hear how they affected Atkinson and the commanders more than how they affected the men.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't what I was sold when I saw it at the bookstore.<br />The value of the book is hearing some of the internal military opinions of what is going on, especially some of their thought processes as they are told some monumentally stupid things (like the fact that they'll be out of Iraq within 6 months).  While much of the action in the book simply seems like a retread of newspaper articles during the war itself, it's this behind the scenes stuff that was neat.  We hear about the logistics of helicopter rotor-blades and (potentially deadly) discussion of whether to use paint or tape to cover the ends in order to protect from the gritty sand.  This is the kind of detail I loved about the book, and Atkinson does a good job of covering it all.  We hear the soldiers' views on the whole thing, which is the usual cynical outlook that allows men to handle this sort of situation.  No matter what they're feelings are about their circumstances, they are all determined to do their jobs to the best of their abilities.<br />This brings up my other small problem with the book.  It is very easy to see that Atkinson was against this war.  Every once in a while,he inserts his opinion into the narrative, either with a side remark or a few paragraphs of lecture.  His Afterword is more of the same, written in January 2004 with a lot of hindsight.  Some of his feeling in this section is understandable, because while only two 101st men died in the war itself, a great number of men who he had come to know (at least to have spoken to once or twice) have died since he left Iraq.  He thinks it has all been for nothing.  While the Afterword is acceptable to me, I felt that his editorial comments in the middle of the book were uncalled for.  He is writing the story of this division in the battle for Iraq.  He is not writing a history of the war itself.  He is not writing a treatise about whether or not this war was a good thing.  He's writing about men in battle.  It's fine if he's reporting the feelings of the soldiers, but I felt that his comments again went against the spirit of the book that I was led to believe this was.  I have nothing against what he said (whether or not I agree with them), but I don't think he chose the proper venue.  Many books have been (and will be) written on the subject of whether or not this war was a good one.  This was not such a book.<br />Overall, I did enjoy reading IN THE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS.  I enjoyed reading the background to the war, something that I hadn't read before.

US	50332419	RZ1GMKHSRITO5	0613494458	225010826	Mendoza in Hollywood	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Isn't that where Psycho was filmed?	Time is once again moving forward (has it ever moved backward?).  In the third Company novel by Kage Baker, Mendoza in Hollywood, our illustrious immortal Mendoza has to deal with some hard issues.  When we last left her in Sky Coyote, she had gone off into early 18th century northern California where she could be alone and study her plants, away from the strange and disgusting mortals (that would be us normal human beings) that surrounded her.<br />I found Sky Coyote to be a flawed but interesting sequel, but I love Baker's writing so I figured that she would rebound in her third book.  Boy, did she ever.  Mendoza in Hollywood is a masterpiece, having everything from social commentary to fascinating characters to mystery and beyond.  We get a brief glimpse of the future, but we see nothing but agonizing hints to what is going on.  Baker uses some of the tricks she used in Sky Coyote, but this time they work.  It feels like Baker was maturing as a writer, determined to correct her mistakes and do it right this time.  The result is a very entertaining read that will keep all Company fans engrossed and may even attract some new fans.<br />The story is quite simple in its complexity (yes, I do mean that).  Character interaction is the name of the game in Mendoza in Hollywood and what wonderful characters Baker has to use.  Every one of them is vivid, from the young Juan Batista, who is tasked with collecting rare birds but becomes too attached to them, to the film buff Einar, who brings in the entertainment for the staff at the outpost.  This usually consists of rare movies, including the original 8 hour cut of Erich Von Stroheim's Greed and D.W. Griffith's Intolerance.  The latter movie is a wonderful character set piece, as the soundtrack is gone and Einar (along with Imarte, who actually lived in ancient Babylon) does the commentary for the entire film.  The sequence is a magical bit of comedy and character development, and is everything that the show in Sky Coyote wasn't.  It goes on for just as long (though Mendoza in Hollywood is a longer book, so the portion is smaller) but is much better written.  I really enjoyed it.<br />Other cast members are equally well done, with Porfirio (the outpost's security officer and commander) being the most bland.  He is given some history that helps define Mendoza's character though, as she finds out that not all immortals have cut their familial ties with the mortal world.  Oscar is a real treat, though.  He's a salesman who is supposed to study living conditions of people in the area.  He goes door to door, trying to sell items and get a look inside the domestic life of his customers.  Mendoza accompanies him on some of his jaunts, and the scenes are just delightfully funny.<br />While there is a running subplot of a British conspiracy with the Confederates for control of California (sparked by the neglectful act of leaving his briefcase by one of Imarte's johns), most of the story is about Mendoza and her interactions with these characters.  It might sound boring, but every page of the book is building up her sense of isolation and her desolation over the death of her lover 300 years ago.  She despises mortals because of how weak they are and how ideological they can be.  Yet every one of her companions loves interacting with them and has their own way of dealing with them.  As Mendoza observes, she feels more and more alone.  Even Einar and his movie obsession, while providing some enjoyment, eventually adds to her burden as she realizes that even though they haven't even happened yet, the movies' settings are ephemeral and won't last long.  Baker illustrates the burdens of immortality.  Some people can deal with it (Joseph, Mendoza's mentor who isn't actually in this book, has been alive for thousands of years), but she can't seem to.  Baker paints these characters with such loving detail that you can't help but revel in them.<br />The book loses a little bit when the conspiracy plottakes center stage, even though Baker keeps the focus clearly on Mendoza and what's happening with her lover's doppelganger.  The interaction between them kept me reading but I started to get tired of the conspiracy itself.  However, I cared about what happened to Mendoza, and as I saw her go through hell yet again, for a man so much like her old lover but yet so different, I really felt for her.  Baker has brought Mendoza alive, and her ultimate fate is heartbreaking yet slightly uplifting.  She finally gets what she wants, but not quite the way she wanted it.  I finished the book very quickly, totally engrossed in what was going on.  That's the sign of a master author.<br />With Mendoza in Hollywood, Kage Baker has another winner.  It's certainly readable by itself, but it gains so much if you read the first two books before this one.  But whatever you do, check this one out.<br />David Royt takes center stage, even though Baker keeps the focus clearly on Mendoza and what's happening with her lover's doppelganger.

Usually they're based on some change in a real-world event:  what would happen if Stonewall Jackson wasn't killed by his own men?  What would happen if Hitler had successfully invaded Great Britain?  Some, however, are a bit more fantastical, and those can be even better.  J. Gregory Keyes has created just such a series in his \\"Age of Unreason\\" books, the first of which is Newton's Cannon.  If the first book is anything to go by, it's going to be a fun read.<br />The first scene is 1681, where Sir Isaac Newton has had a startling revelation in his study of alchemy, unleashing \\"Philosopher's Mercury\\" which allows people to manipulate the four elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Water.  This produces things like floating balls of light that make candles obsolete, and powerful weapons as well.  We then move to 1720.  The French and the English are at war and King Louis XIV of France demands a weapon that will turn the tide, a weapon so devastating that even he doesn't know what he's unleashed.  a device known mysteriously as Newton's Cannon.  Over in the Colonies, a young apprentice named Benjamin Franklin has stumbled upon the secret.  Using the new devices that allow words to be transferred over vast distances, he stumbles upon a mathematical problem that he has the answer for.  But is he helping the English, or is he making a terrible mistake?<br />Newton's Cannon is a great blend of science, a little bit of magic, and a whole lot of \\"what-if.\\"  The historical characters, while much younger than we are familiar with (Ben Franklin starts at age 12), are still fairly recognizable.  Ben is very intelligent, a writer and a printer's apprentice to his older brother, James.  He's also an inventor, which unfortunately brings him a bit of trouble in this book.  The story follows two plot lines:  Benjamin Franklin's and a woman named Adrienne, who becomes involved with King Louis.  Occasionally, the viewpoint switches to the king's, and it gets a bit distracting when it does that, but it's not too bad.  For the most part, though, the chapters alternate between Ben and Adrienne, with no variance in that pattern.  Of course, most of the chapters leave off with cliffhangers which make you want to read just one more chapter (actually two, though, considering you have to read a chapter with the other character first).  This pattern can get a bit tiring after a while, and it would have been nice to have another viewpoint character to liven things up a little bit.<br />One other aspect of Keyes's writing that also got a bit annoying was his tendency to open a chapter with either Ben or Adrienne knocked out or asleep, and having to have the events of the last little while explained to them.  It happened three or four times, and while it can be a valid technique at times, I think it should be used sparingly.  It's almost as annoying as constantly starting chapters in the middle of the action and explaining how they came about in flashback.  Thankfully, Keyes doesn't go that far.  With the exception of these little things, though, his prose is decent.  There were no turns of phrase that made me shiver in appreciation, but he didn't make any real mistakes either.  It's a pleasant read that grabs you and holds on to you.<br />While the historical characters are done well, I can't quite say the same thing for the other incidental characters.  The French chief of security, Torcy, isn't too bad though he doesn't get a lot of characterization until the end.  Adrienne, of course, is fleshed out greatly, but her scientific companions (especially Fatio) don't get much.  This is a shame, because Fatio is actually the driving force behind the fiendish plot and it would have been nice to get a little motivation from him. We get the picture that he is a former student of Newton's and they had a falling out, but that's it. It's unclear who survives the book (except Newton and Franklin, of course) so we don't even know if they will appear in the next books to flesh out their characters a little bit.  It's a shame, because they could have been interesting.  Newton's philosophical companions suffer from sounding much the same, with only MacLaurin's Scottish brogue distinguishing him from the rest (except for the woman, of course).  All in all, they get just enough characterization to do their jobs, but not enough to always be interesting.<br />This is a very plot-driven book.  Two main characters drive most of it and they are what makes the plot interesting.  You can feel Ben's horror as he realizes what he's done and tries to take steps to rectify it.  Adrienne is trapped in a situation not of her devising, and she has to decide whether to be the queen or the pawn in the situation.  Then again, if she can work things right, she can be one of the players instead of one of the pieces.  There's something else lurking in the background, just waiting to jump out and make their decisions moot.  There are some questions that are left hanging (just who is Bracewell and what was he doing with Ben before Ben made his discovery that made him dangerous?), but they may be explained in the next book.  Then again, circumstances in this book make it so that's not very likely.<br />All in all, Newton's Cannon is a very good first book and will definitely make you want to go further.  It's not your normal alternate history, but rather a historical fantasy.  People who don't like alternate history should not necessarily stay away from it.  It just uses a historical background to make the setting easier for both author and reader.

Seldom do we think of what effect such a battle may have on the outside world.  Sometimes, the only effect is on the relatives of those fallen in battle.  Other times, however, there are wider repercussions.<br />Ripples of Battle, by Victor Davis Hanson, doesn't quite live up to what the cover promises, which is a shame.  Its subtitle is &quot;How wars of the past still determine how we fight, how we live, and how we think.&quot; Unfortunately, the book isn't quite as far-ranging as this sounds.  It covers three battles: the American invasion of Okinawa in World War II, the battle of Shiloh in the American Civil War, and the battle of Delium in 422 BC.  In looking at these battles, Hanson discusses some of the aftereffects they had on western society.  This is fine, and actually quite interesting, but the title makes the book sound like a broad sociological text and the innards don't quite deliver this.<br />Once I got past these preconceived notions, I actually found the book quite fascinating.  Hanson begins by discussing the bloodbath that was the battle of Okinawa.  The Japanese garrison of 110,000 troops was almost completely wiped out, fighting to the last man.  The Americans themselves lost over 15,000 men with over 33,000 wounded.  The Japanese garrison had no illusions that they could defeat the Americans at this point in the war, but that didn't matter.  Instead, they meant to take as many Americans with them as they could.  While suicidal banzai charges and kamikaze aircraft attacks were periodic occurrences before, Okinawa saw the first instances of organized suicide attacks.  The sole purpose of every Japanese soldier was to take as many Americans with him as possible.  This is obviously a ripple that has affected the waters of the modern day, with suicide bombers blowing themselves up for a cause.  What the modern day bombers seem to have missed from this history lesson, however, is the fact that it did not work.  The Americans were not stopped at Okinawa.  They did not sue for peace, horrified at the losses they took.  Instead, their determination was strengthened and they forged ahead.  This is one of the major facets of the Okinawa campaign, though Hanson does discuss others.<br />As interesting as these stories were, however, I found the Shiloh history to be even more fascinating.  Shiloh was, up to that point, the bloodiest day in the Civil War.  It also resulted in the rise in stature of General Sherman, who eventually began the strategy of economic warfare, burning his way through the Confederate economy while killing relatively few people.  General Lew Wallace was disgraced at Shiloh, and he spent the rest of his life trying to clear his name.  One way he did this was by writing the novel Ben-Hur.  Nathan Bedford Forrest, a southern cavalry officer, also rose to prominence on that fateful day, and he became one of the driving forces behind the Ku Klux Klan.  There were also others.  This entire chapter is just one fascinating insight after another, and Hanson does an admirable job of presenting everything in a clear, concise manner.<br />There is one problem with Ripples of Battle, however, and that is the final chapter.  The battle between the Athenians and the Boeotians of Thebes does not follow the theme of the book as closely, and isn't as interesting either.  The main problem is the discussion of Socrates, who was one of the few Athenian survivors of the battle.  Hanson spends an entire section of the final chapter discussing what would have happened to western philosophy, from Socrates himself to Plato and elsewhere, if he had died.  This falls into the realm of &quot;what-if&quot; though, and doesn't fit.  The rest of the book deals with real and unforeseen consequences to the battles in question.  Since Socrates didn't die, it has no place here.  The rest of the chapter does fit, however, with the first instance of real infantry tactics and the future effects on Athens from various survivors of the battle.  Hanson fails to make it interesting, though, constantly repeating himself (especially in the Socrates section) and generally making it a chore to read.<br />Hanson redeems himself, however, with an interesting epilogue that ties the whole book together, though he does suffer from repetition yet again.  He discusses the various impacts battles can have on us as a society, and how there are so many different reasons that a given battle can affect us.  Sometimes it's the accessibility of the history, sometimes it's who's involved (if Socrates had not been involved in the battle of Delium, much of it, if any, would not have been recorded).  Hanson relates a lot of what he's discussed to the World Trade Center attacks and the current war on terrorism.  We do not know how current violence, like the genocide in Rwanda, will affect us as time goes on, but we can make a supposition based on how it's happened in the past.<br />Battles will continue to be an important part of history, and Hanson is trying to show the importance of studying them.  The study of history has changed to a study of cultural trends, which Hanson believes is incomplete.  The point of this book is to show how the study of great men (and women) and how they fight each other can still be an important aspect of history.  In The Ripples of Battle, he does an effective job, creating a fascinating read as well.<br />David Royit has no place here.

I picked up both RUBICON and SWORDS AGAINST THE SENATE at the same time, for some reason thinking that SWORDS was about the fall of Roman Empire itself.  Little did I know that I was reading two books on basically the same subject at the same time.  However, this did give me a great insight into the time period and allowed me to do a good comparison of the information.  I'm glad it worked out this way.<br />SWORDS AGAINST THE SENATE, by Erik Hildinger, doesn't cover quite the same ground as Tom Holland's RUBICON, as it covers a briefer time period.  However, this gives it the opportunity to go a little deeper into the information it does present.  It covers the first three decades in the 70 years it took for the Roman Republic to fall to pieces.  It also gives a bit more information on the rise of the Republic to begin with, from its rise in the 400's BC to the sack of Rome by the Gauls in 386 and its subsequent recovery.  Between this brief overview and the extensive look at the seemingly endless wars that brought down the Republic, this book is a great find.  It's also fairly short, which adds to its attraction.<br />In his introduction, Hildinger remarks that his book will cover three aspects of Roman life:  the army, the personalities, and the &quot;gradual chipping away of the constitution&quot; that led to the republic's demise.  He expertly interweaves these branches of the story into a wonderful narrative that's interesting to read and hard to put down.  At times, this does feel a bit disjointed, as he will introduce the characters involved and then go on a brief diversion to explain how the army was set up at that time.  Once he gets back to the narrative, though, it's obvious why he diverted down the path as the knowledge is valuable to understanding what is happening.  While this may sound boring, it really isn't.  He rarely spends more than a couple of pages on the specifics of the army make-up before moving on.<br />One place where I have to give Hildinger a lot of credit is in his use of sources.  He uses a variety of primary and secondary sources, along with some more modern interpretive sources (something Holland didn't really do) to back up his narrative.  He also is not afraid to say when the sources are unclear on a subject, especially where casualty figures are concerned.  He often states the given casualty figures and then reminds us that these figures were often exaggerated.  If something was taken from Sulla's memoirs (for example), he'll remind the reader that this could very well have been included to make Sulla look good.  He'll make informed suppositions about certain things, but he's always clear when something might not be true:<br />&quot;Sulla took no direct hand in following up the killing, and *apparently* no one was punished.&quot;  pg 184 (emphasis added)<br />I found that this added to the attraction of the book, giving me a feeling of piecing together history along with Hildinger.<br />The book does have a heavy concentration on the army and on military elements.  Hildinger details the various wars (both external and civil) that took place in this 30 year period, how various Roman generals and consuls took their troops and marched them on Rome, or formed their own private armies and went campaigning in Asia.  We get descriptions of the battles, some of the tactics (at least as much as is known), and the fight for who would get credit for various victories.  We also get the politics behind the various wars, along with the personality conflicts that would ultimately sunder the republic, especially those between Marius and Sulla.  Ultimately, Sulla would win out and become the appointed dictator while he got the constitution back in order.<br />The book ends with Sulla's victory, and the epilogue talks of how Sulla created a new constitution and then retired after three years as dictator, allowing the Roman Republic to reassume power, though the fissures were already in place to bring it toppling down again.  This makes a good stopping point for Hildinger, as this book is really about how the army was involved in this conflict, and how the personalities used it.  Once Sulla retires, it becomes much more of a personal battle between strong-willed men.<br />For those who wish a general overview of how the Roman Republic fell, SWORDS AGAINST THE SENATE isn't really a good place to start.  It doesn't cover the whole thing and it's a little too detailed for that.  It may, however, spark your interest so that you do want to go on to an overall account after you have read it.  It also is a valuable source for military matters in this time period.  In whatever order you decide to read it, you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy.<br />David Royling down again.

It's a fascinating question, and one that seems to be an inspiration to Tom Holland, as he mentions it in the introduction to Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic.  Or, maybe it wasn't one, since this is the last time he mentions it.  The reader is left to his/her own conclusions on this issue, but unfortunately the back cover draws attention to this aspect making you think that's what the book is going to be about.<br />Instead, he gives us a history of the fall of the Republic, from the late 2nd century BC to the death of Caesar in 44 BC.  Holland covers all the wars, civil unrest and the decline of senatorial power as he shows us the events leading to dictatorship.  The history is dotted with colourful characters (from Caesar to Spartacus to Cleopatra and beyond) and Holland brings them all to life, often in their own words.  In doing so, Holland has produced a very readable account, meticulously researched, that will make anybody with even a mild interest in this time period clamour for more.<br />Holland begins (also in his introduction) by talking about the amount of information from this time period that we have access to, as it's one of the most recorded periods in ancient history.  Yet even so, it's impossible to take everything written as fact, immune to different interpretations.  Instead, it's a minefield where historians have to tread carefully.<br />&quot;In short, the reader should take it as a rule of thumb that many statements of fact in this book could plausibly be contradicted by an opposite interpretation.&quot;  Pg xx (introduction)<br />This is all well and good, and I'm glad that he warned us.  While all history is subject to interpretation (or even outright lies, depending on what the sources are and how biased they are), the further back you go the worse it gets.  However, one thing I wish Holland would have done is to acknowledge this within the text as well.  It would have been interesting to see him discuss a couple of interpretations of conflicting events as he told us about them, something like:<br />{XX happened, according to Plutarch, but other accounts say YY happened.  It seems logical to assume, given the equipment involved, that a combination of XX and YY is what truly happened.}<br />Instead, we get one narrative with a warning at the beginning that, we have to remember, this may not be the right one.<br />Holland uses a wealth of primary sources as well as sources written within the next 100-200 years after the fall of the Republic.  This brings the issues sharply into focus as we get a closer look at what these people had to deal with.  However, part of this goes back to the issue of bias and interpretation.  Some the sources (Cicero is the primary example, but there are others) are heavily involved with these events, thus making their stories slightly suspect (or at least biased).  Yes, we have to keep in mind Holland's warning in the introduction, but it's easy to lose track of this as you read the narrative.<br />That being said, the narrative Holland gives us is wonderful.  He is very detailed, giving us somewhat of a history of each character as he introduces him/her.  While this is not a history of Roman culture, but of government, he gives us enough information to get an idea of why these events were so monumental.  We see the value Romans put in to their Republic and the fact that the people were able to vote on things (though of course it wasn't like our modern-day voting, where anybody can do it).  With each step toward the abyss, we see the inevitability of what happened.  The benefits of hindsight are wonderful, and perhaps that's where Holland's reference to current events should be placed.  As we read about Marius and Sulla and other Romans who tried to enhance their own power at the expense of the Senate, are there any &quot;characters&quot; hanging around right now who are doing similar things?<br />Another place Holland excels is in keeping the various names of Roman characters straight (Gaius This and Gaius That).  I've always found confusing who's who in the Roman Empire, but Holland helps this immensely.  Even so, at times I had to stop and think who he was talking about, but the clearness of the narrative makes it a lot easier to keep organized in my brain.  This also applies to the sometimes confusing events.  Barbarians to the North, uppity kings to the East, slave revolts and other major events all combine to bring down the once mighty empire and allow one man to rise to the top to save it (dispensing with that pesky &quot;the people decide&quot; aspect, however).  Holland is a radio personality in Britain, and I think this gives him the ability to break down the events in ways that are easier to understand.  The author's description mentions he has a PhD, but it doesn't say in what, so I have no idea if it's in history or not.  Even so, he seems to have done his research and presented it in an easily readable, and more importantly, fascinating narrative.<br />For an introduction into the Roman Republic (and especially for those of you who thought Roman history *began* with Julius Caesar), this is a great book.  Do yourself a favour and pick it up.<br />David Royanging around right now who are doing similar things?<br />Another place Holland excels is in keeping the various names of Roman characters straight (Gaius This and Gaius That).

When the Robinsons invite us over for dinner, we never know whether it's to have dinner or for dinner. So far, it hasn't been an issue, thankfully. But you never know with that zany family!<br />I'm not sure I want to read about them, however. Combat Rock, by Mick Lewis, is full of them. Not just full of them, but full of graphic descriptions of them. There is so much blood and gore (and not just from cannibals) in this book that I was faintly sickened as I read it, and I have a strong stomach. What are our intrepid Dr. Who heroes doing in a monstrosity such as this? Not much, actually, which is another problem with this book.<br />The Indoni have colonized an alien planet for years, making it a haven for tourists. Some Papul locals make their living from this tourist trade (women of the street, tour guides, etc) while others bristle under the oppressive regime. But something is lurking in the jungles. 400 year old tribal mummies have come back to life and begin murdering tourists. Ferocious beasts roam the jungle, making food out of unsuspecting prey. The local population in the jungle seem to have reverted to cannibalism, all at the direction of some mysterious man, the Krallik. The Doctor's insatiable urge to investigate leads them right into the middle of a civil war, an ugly one at that. None of the sides are particularly attractive and the Doctor has to rescue his friends and try to keep them alive. Along with getting to the bottom of things, of course, like he always does.<br />I'll get the main problem with this book out of the way, because it's a question of taste and style. Mick Lewis' first Who book, Rags, was an interesting look at violence and how it affects us. It was a horror book, but it seemed to have a point to make about violence. Combat Rock, however, seems to be missing even that justification. It is an ugly book, but it doesn't seem to be an ugly book with a purpose. It's full of violence, with descriptions of people being incinerated, brains being eaten, shot with blood pumping, and dismemberment. The excessiveness of it hardened me to it after a while, but it was still extremely unpleasant to read. If you're squeamish at all, avoid this book like you would a Michael Bolton song.<br />When I say style, I mean the fact that Combat Rock doesn't fit in with the Second Doctor's era at all. The Doctor, Jamie, and Victoria seem horribly out of place in this book. I'm sure Lewis was trying to contrast the innocence of the era with the ugliness of reality, but it just doesn't work. I don't like seeing Victoria, a 19th century upper-crust young British woman, threatened with violence in the middle of the jungle. It's not something I want to read about. Jamie isn't as bad, considering the fact that he comes from a Scottish combat background to begin with. The Doctor feels lost in the middle of all this, though he does wonderfully in the final confrontation with Krallik<br />Another problem with the book is that it's fully of extraneous characters. Lewis does nothing with the two female Indoni other than have them along for the ride and have them threatened by their captors. The mercenary team roaming the jungle does a lot of shooting, killing, burning, maiming and some sleeping around, but ultimately don't amount to much. Lewis attempts to give their leader, Pan, a bit character by going into his background to explain why he treats women the way he does. Since he bored and disgusted me, you can just imagine what those sequences did for me.<br />Even a worse sin, however, is what Lewis does with the regulars. Mainly, nothing! They are along for the ride, but other than the Doctor's final confrontation with Krallik, they don't do anything. They get captured, and they go places. Jamie gets sent on a combat mission with the rebels and Victoria gets captured by the Indoni and sees how ugly they are, but neither of them actually does anything throughout their whole time on screen. Their characterization is ok (though the Doctor doesn't feel like Troughton despite a couple of &quot;oh my giddy Aunt!&quot; expressions), but they are extra. This story would hardly have changed if it were not a Dr. Who story. That's inexcusable in my book.<br />There is not a likable character in the bunch. There are two semi-likable tourists who are captured along with the Doctor's party, but we don't see much of them and then they are summarily killed (or at least one of them is, but the other one disappears, so it amounts to the same thing). I cared about what happened to the Doctor and his companions, but I already know they're going to be safe (they do have some TV stories after this to star in). I didn't care if anybody else lived or died, not even the missionaries.<br />I never thought I'd give a 1 star rating to any book that I had finished, because if I was able to finish it then there had to be something to keep me reading. But I have to do it here, because I cannot recommend this book at all. Maybe if you're a horror fan who likes blood and gore, you may like this one (assuming the Dr. Who logo doesn't turn you off).

I thought that she was a talented writer that resorted to too many fantasy cliches, and hoped that her second book (which was supposed to come out a year later) would move away from those.  2002 came and went with no book.  Finally, in August 2003, First Rider's Call came out.  With her first book not being the greatest, would the sophomore jinx kill Britain's writing?  Thankfully, no.  First Rider's Call is a rich story with vivid characterization and a surprising depth.  She still uses a few too many cliches, but it's nothing like Green Rider in that respect.<br />Kerigan G'ladheon thought she had left the call of the Green Rider behind her after saving the king from an Eletian plot.  However, returning to her merchant family's business doesn't provide the rest that she had expected.  She is haunted by the ghost of the First Rider, who is endeavoring to convince Kerigan to follow her destiny and resume the King's service.  Reluctantly, she does so, and just in time.  Danger is threatening the kingdom of Sacoridia once again.  Blackveil Forest, sequestered behind the D'Yer wall for thousands of years, is stirring once again.  Evil forces from a long ago time are threatening to get through a breach in the wall, with some having already succeeded.  Havoc is sweeping the countryside, people turned to stone and crops withered.  Refugees from up north are flooding into other provinces, creating internal strife.  King Zachary must balance all of these situations together, keeping his people from panicking and trying to find out what's going on.<br />Other things are going wild as well.  The magic of the Green Riders is becoming unpredictable.  Captain Mapstone's magical ability attacks her, forcing her to confine herself when she's needed most.  Kerigan's ability is sending her wildly into the past and future, as she learns the secret of the First Rider and what happened all those generations ago, when people from across the sea came and tried to colonize the wild land.  In doing so, she discovers the haunting truth of her own heritage, as well as the secrets of the Wall.  Hopefully, she'll live to tell the tale.<br />While this isn't the most original plot around, Britain does try to do some new things with the familiar tropes she is using.  The story is deep and rich, with the prose working much better than Green Rider.  Britain really seems to have honed her craft with this one.  She does suffer from a few cliches (Eletians are basically elves with the pointy-ears filed down, for example), but for the most part she avoids the potential landmines in her path.  She has an interesting cast of characters as well.<br />Kerigan makes a vivid viewpoint character.  She's matured since Green Rider, but she's still unsure of herself at times.  Unfortunately, she's much too passive, with too many events occurring around her rather than her being the main cause of them.  Part of this is explained by the unique relationship between Kerigan and the First Rider, but it's still not enough.  While Kerigan's involved in the climax of the story, she doesn't actually figure much in the resolution.  Still, despite this fault, I did grow to care about what happened to her, especially as things start to deteriorate in the kingdom.<br />Then there's King Zachary.  He's actually very good, but he brings up another problem with the story.  There is a lot of romantic tension between Kerigan and him, and it's completely unnecessary to the book.  It doesn't add anything to the story, and the consummation of the relationship (and that *doesn't* mean that they sleep together in this case) makes it even more superfluous.  At over 600 pages, the book is long enough already.  This relationship just drags it out more, making the denouement of the story more tedious than it needs to be.  I realize that Britain may be setting up something for the next book, but I think she should have also madeit mean something in this one as well.  Otherwise, Zachary is extremely well done, being a fair ruler who is not above getting his hands dirty when the situation warrants it.<br />The plot of First Rider's Call is much more intricate than Green Rider, and Britain handles it deftly.  There's so much going on that it would have been easy for her to lose her way.  Instead, she is generally able to keep the flow of the story, with only the scenes in the Blackveil Forest slowing it down.  The Alton sequences could have had a bit more punch to them, as he isn't that interesting of a character and I kept wanting to get back to Kerigan when he was on screen.  Given the business of the plot, though, this is a small problem and I didn't have any trouble getting back into the story.  I found the use of diaries from the past led beautifully to the revelation of Kerigan's heritage (though I did see it coming very early, there's no way the characters would have known about it).<br />All in all, First Rider's Call is a very good sophomore effort, and I look forward to seeing more of Britain's writing.  Whether it will be the third book in this series or if she'll try something else, I plan to follow her career and see how she does.<br />David Royit mean something in this one as well.

US	50332419	R21SA8NT3E12K3	0563538562	667660902	The Crooked World (Doctor Who)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	But it's only a toon!  Right?	In the land of cartoons, everything stays the same. Sylvester will never catch Tweety. Wile E. Coyote will never catch the roadrunner. Elmer will never catch Bugs. It's comfortable, and we like it that way. But what do they think? Is Sylvester happy chasing Tweety all the time? Does Daffy like constantly being blown up, only to come back as good as new? Do we ever think to ask? Of course not. These are cartoons. They don't have feelings. Right?<br />The Crooked World, by Steve Lyons, takes us to a world where cartoons are real. Not only real, but stuck in the same motions again and again. Nothing ever changes here, and the inhabitants don't know any better. Cats chase birds and mice because that's just the way it is. Everything works like it does in the cartoons that you and I grew up with. Until the Doctor and his companions show up. Streaky Bacon, a hunter after the Whatchamacallit (a fast-running bird) to protect his crops, accidentally ends up shooting the Doctor in the chest. As the Doctor lies bleeding, Streaky realizes that he's not going to just get up again and run away like has always happened before. This sparks a virus that spreads like wildfire throughout the Crooked World. This isn't a medical virus. Instead, it's a free will virus. All of a sudden, toons are starting to actually think about their circumstances. Why should the cat never get the mouse? Why should the villains always fail but get away to scheme another day?<br />Having introduced these thoughts to the residents, the Doctor, Fitz &amp; Anji decide they should stay to help the toons through the transition. Once the toons start to think, there is no going back. The only question is: how much bloodshed and real violence will occur while they come to terms with what's happened to them? What's the secret of Spooky Manor, and why can't anyone approach it? Does it hold the secret of what created this world? Or is it just a place for &quot;those meddling kids&quot; to operate?<br />I love this book. I have not seen a book that works comedy in with a poignancy that's unequaled in any Who book I've read recently. These are just cartoons, but Lyons gives them character beyond that, making you really care about what happens to them. He balances the superficiality of the cartoon with the richness of three-dimensional characters so superbly that I have to shake my head. He is able to make points about free will even as he demonstrates the absurdity of the situation. He's even able to get jokes in there which will make you laugh hard if you're familiar with the cartoons at all (the Scooby Doo parody is spot-on, with them having to take a long, winding route to get where they have to go because the van would break down if they get anywhere near a place that's even remotely spooky).<br />Even as you recognize where most of the main toon characters came from (Sylvester, Tom &amp; Jerry, the Scooby Doo gang, Elmer Fudd/Porky Pig, Scrappy Doo and other recognizable faces, all with different names of course), Lyons is able to give them their own personality, shining especially bright as they slowly start to realize that there's more to life then what they've constantly been doing for who knows how long. Boss Dogg, the sheriff, is determined that things will go back to the way they were, and everybody should just &quot;get over&quot; all this free thinking stuff. Especially touching, however, is Jasper. He's &quot;Tom&quot; from the Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons, so he can't talk. But he's desperate to find out what he's been missing once he's able to think, and he looks to Fitz for guidance. Not being able to speak, he tries to do the only thing he can do, scratch out four little words: WHAT SHOULD I DO? He's also the first one to have to face the consequences of what free will gives them. Streaky also falls to the depths of despair over what he's done and his confusion over what to do. Some of the scenes involving him brought a tear to my eye, especially when he hits rock bottom but can't do anything about it.<br />The regulars are handled competently, though they act more as catalysts in this story then anything else. Fitz fall for Angel Falls (Penelope Pitstop) and tries to show her other things you can do with free will, though he finds out more (or, I guess, less) than he's looking for once he gets her to accept it. Anji hooks up with the Skeleton Crew and becomes another &quot;meddling kid.&quot; The Doctor, however, is wonderful. He knows that they are the cause of everything and he feels nothing but compassion for these toons. He brings the entire free will issue into perspective.<br />The book only has a couple of problems, and one of them isn't even the author's fault, instead caused by the way these books are produced. In The Book of the Still, Anji makes a lot of Scooby Doo comparisons. Yet in The Crooked World, she joins up with something that is so obviously a parody of the whole Scooby Doo concept and she acts like she's never heard of such a thing. Obviously, Lyons didn't know that the previous author was going to put Scooby references in and thus he didn't think he needed to explain it. The other fault is an ongoing joke about wrapped sticks of dynamite never going off, but it really doesn't lead anywhere.<br />Other than that, though, I found this book perfect. I have never laughed and teared up so much at the same time as I did with this book. Steve Lyons has written a classic Who book, one that even non-Who fans can enjoy. It is just that good.<br />David Royck bottom but can't do anything about it. <br />The regulars are handled competently, though they act more as catalysts in this story then anything else.

US	50332419	R3RK5W1GUOIPHI	0670032891	260413038	The Well of Lost Plots: A Thursday Next Novel	Books	4	5	8	N	N	Fictional cops are all the same	What if you could visit the world of fiction, interacting with characters like Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights and Miss Havisham from Great Expectations, all at the same time? And what if Miss Havisham was running anger-management classes for Heathcliff and his fellow Heights characters? We get to find out in The Well of Lost Plots, Jasper Fforde's third novel in his Thursday Next series, following intrepid literary detective Next as she gets involved with literary conspiracies that will affect how you and I read books, as well as teaching two blank slate \\"generics\\" how to become true fictional personalities. Fforde, as ever, is irreverent and full of great concepts. However, this time his lack of true characters hinders the reader's enjoyment just a little bit.<br /> Jasper Fforde is the master of imagery and a very creative man. In his previous books, The Eyre Affair and Lost in a Good Book , Fforde has created a world where fiction is real and can be traveled through, but he also created an alternate reality where history isn't quite the same, where the Crimean War between Russia and Britain has been going on for 150 years. This time, while the Crimean War setting is very vital to one plot point, Fforde immerses us entirely in the fictional world, with characters from bad detective novels interacting with characters from Wuthering Heights. As always, Fforde's trademark wit and humour make the book a lot of fun and a joy to read.<br />In previous books, I've said that Fforde stays away from characters in favour of providing a strong setting and vivid images. In The Well of Lost Plots, Fforde does the same, but he goes a bit overboard. The one well-realized character has always been Thursday Next, but this time even she isn't that well done. Sure, she's still a strong character, but Fforde seems to be drifting on her past characterization, depending on the fact that we've probably read the previous two books to provide her character. With the exception of her having to relive the last day of her brother's life over and over again, she receives no development whatsoever. The other characters are the same way, relative ciphers that interact with the plot but that's about it. Fforde is hampered in this by the fact that all of the other characters in this novel (save one) are already established literary characters, or they are literary cliches on purpose. Inevitably, these characters are established by having a couple of traits different from their \\"on-screen\\" personalities in their books (i.e. Miss Havisham is still a prickly old lady like she is in Great Expectations, but she actually does have a true heart beneath her harsh exterior). The detective novel characters fit their stereotypes, but they are just slightly different to show off the same effect. Thus, there are not truly memorable characters. Instead, there are memorable character differences (\\"Oh, Prometheus is really like that!).<br />Without characterization, what are we left with? Plot and imagery. For a long while, there didn't seem to be much of a plot, though Fforde does an admirable job of making the wandering about in the first part of the book actually mean something. In the meantime, while we are wandering, the settings and concepts that Fforde has created are still top notch. I really enjoyed learning about all the different aspects of fiction, and how the characters are able to interact. When a character is not front stage in a book, they can do pretty much what they want. It sort of begs the question of how this is possible, considering the fact that, especially in the classics or bestsellers, each page in the book is inevitably being read by somebody somewhere. But it's a conceit the reader makes to revel in the world Fforde has created. It's a fun place, with some wacky events. Who but Fforde could imagine Miss Havisham trying to break the land-speed record in a souped-up car? Or an assassination squad trying to take out Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights because he's such an arrogant scoundrel? Fforde really brings his world alive, and the reader is carried along with the flow.<br />One problem that Fforde has, however, is how to tell the reader about this fabulous world. Exposition is very heavy as Fforde has the fictional characters explain what is happening to Thursday, a Jurisfiction novice. While this is much better than having two characters talk to each other about things they should already be aware of, even having them explain it to Thursday becomes old after awhile. There are just so many new things (something we probably shouldn't complain about) that I don't know how else it could have been done, but it was starting to get annoying.<br />Still, The Well of Lost Plots is a satisfying read, just not as much so as the previous books. I really enjoyed it, and plan on coming back for the next one. Don't worry if you're not the most literary reader. Most of the literary references are either obvious or will zoom by without you even knowing about it. Give this series a chance. I think you'll enjoy it.<br />David Royeights because he's such an arrogant scoundrel?

US	50332419	RXLKO5001Z443	038097875X	724936298	A Blind Eye: A Novel (Ford, G. M.)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Snowblind and snowjobbed	Setting your mysteries in Seattle (one of my favourite cities) is not the way to keep me as a reader, but it will certainly help get me started.  Thankfully, G.M. Ford has a way with writing that will always keep me around.  His Leo Waterman mysteries were first-rate, and his Frank Corso books have kept his string of winning novels alive.  A Blind Eye continues this, as Ford creates a page-turner that will keep any hard-boiled detective fan glued to the text.<br />True Crime author and disgraced newspaper reporter Frank Corso is having a bad day.  He's stuck in Chicago's O'Hare airport, snowed in and stranded, with an irate Meg Dougherty (former lover and one real friend) along for the ride.  Why is Meg irate?  Because Frank never bothered to tell her that the reason for the &quot;story&quot; they are pursuing is really because two Texas rangers have a warrant for his arrest.  Stuck in an airport, his picture showing up on CNN and security starting to look at him strangely, Corso drags Meg on an ill-considered car ride into Wisconsin, where icy roads send them to the bottom of a ravine.  What they discover there will bring more than just Texas law enforcement down on his head.  It will involve them in a cross-country trip on the trail of a serial killer uncaught for over 30 years.  It also, of course, makes him a target.<br />A Blind Eye takes Corso out of his familiar Seattle, and I think it stretched Ford's writing talent as well.  Seattle and western Washington has always been a cozy location for him in which to write, with familiar territory and landmarks making identification easier. This one starts out in Chicago, goes to southern Wisconsin, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and the wilds of the New Jersey mountains.  Removed from his familiar environs, Ford has to work a little bit harder, and he does a great job.  Some of it is a bit stereotypical (I'm from Iowa, and he captures it decently, but not wonderfully), but overall it shows that he did some research on his locales.  Removing Corso and Dougherty from the northwest also allows him to broaden their characters as well.  Seeing them on the run presents a different side of them, how they react when desperation hits.  Usually, we see our heroes chasing the bad guys, not the other way around.<br />The relationship between Dougherty and Corso crackles with energy.  They used to be lovers and have now become the best of friends.  Dougherty is extremely annoyed with Corso, but she goes along with him anyway.  She obviously still loves him to put up with all that he puts her through.  In fact, their relationship goes through an even more pronounced change in A Blind Eye, evolving as they are forced together by circumstances.  That's one thing I love about Ford's writing: the characters are always open to change and growth.  While it certainly is not necessary to read the books in order, things change enough that you are rewarded for doing so.  This makes both of them even deeper characters then most genre detectives.<br />The minor characters are given just enough depth to be believable while not overshadowing the protagonists.  The sheriff of the Wisconsin town is predictably overwhelmed by having all of the media attention centered on her, along with a gloryhound deputy who's gunning for her job.  This situation actually ends up being important, driving some of the action despite the fact that it's not center-stage.  This is a bit distracting from the main plot, but it's not critical.  Most of the rest get little, if any, development, but their suitably quirky and/or malevolent to serve their roles.  The one exception to this isn't obvious until the end, however.  In between some of the chapters are entries from a journal whose author is unrevealed.  As the book goes on, it becomes clearer and actually adds to the horror of what is happening, as we realize that the cycle of violence may not be ending like we thought it would.<br />There are only a couple of faults with this book.  The first is the fact that there are some superfluous scenes in the book that seem to be included just to show us how tough Corso is.  Regular readers already know how tough he is, and subsequent events in the book show this to new readers.  Unless Ford is just trying to show us what our rights are during a traffic stop, I see no point to them.  While this is forgivable, the second problem is far more damning.<br />The book posits the existence of a super-secret organization that journalists and others can use to get information that is otherwise unobtainable (at least in a timely manner).  This organization is so secret that they will not accept any new queries from a phone number they don't have on file, and any such calls require that the phone be disposed of as soon as the call is completed.  The presentation of this organization screams PLOT DEVELOPMENT every time Corso uses it, bringing me out of the narrative.  It results in a couple of funny scenes (especially when Corso has to use Meg's phone for a question), but overall it's just distracting.<br />Overall, A Blind Eye is a wonderful page-turner.  It's not a taxing read, in fact it's perfect for Sunday afternoons or beach reading.  If you like your mysteries with great characters who grow and change, the Frank Corso books are definitely for you.  You don't even have very many to catch up on.

Her books about the Company are not to be missed.  How successful would she be at fantasy?  If The Anvil of the World is anything to go by, she has nothing to worry about.  With her trademark wit and punchy style fully in evidence, The Anvil of the World contains enough juicy goodness for even the most cynical palate.<br />The book is actually a collection of three linked novellas starring Smith (an alias), a man of many mysteries and an unknown past.  A blood feud (the Children of the Sun are notorious for them) has forced him to become the caravan master in his cousin's business, and he's selected to lead one to the pleasure city of Salesh with some valuable cargo.  Things don't quite go as planned.  In the second story, Smith has started a hotel in Salesh with the staff from his caravan, and business is booming, especially during festival time when freedom is loose and the participants are looser.  Unfortunately, a death in the hotel could cost him everything as the constable gives him just four days to present a murderer or the constable will shut down the hotel.  The third story involves an expedition to rescue Lord Ermenwyr's sister.  This becomes a mission of destiny for Smith, as it turns out he holds the fate of the entire world in his hands.  One wrong decision will result in the death of everything.<br />Baker has a wonderful way with words, and The Anvil of the World is a breezy read.  She is a master character-builder, knowing just how much detail to add to make you care about (or at least be entertained by) each person in the story.  The two biggest characters are Smith and Lord Ermenwyr.  Smith is a former assassin who's given it up because he was getting tired of killing.  Now he just wants to be left alone to run his business.  Ermenwyr is a decadent demonic half-breed who whines a lot and thinks he's going to die all the time.  He's also immature and stubborn, causing Smith no end of grief. It's even worse when his family gets involved.<br />The world Baker has created is alive.  While there are many races around, there are mainly two:  The Children of the Sun (humans, basically) and the Yendri, a deeply spiritual people who abhor violence (though they're not above having others do it for them).  The Children of the Sun have all the foibles that our own human race has, especially where ecology is concerned.  In fact, that's one of the minor problems I have with the book, that the ecological message is heavy-handed at times, especially in the last story.  One pitfall she avoids, however, is making the Yendri pure of heart.  Many of them think they are, but Baker does a good job showing both the good and the bad side of them.<br />The best thing I can say about this book is that it's fun.  While Ermenwyr is the source for most of the humour, everybody gets involved.  Smith is the straight man for the most part, trying to deal with people trying to kill him or his companions.  When he realizes that he is the key to whether or not the world is destroyed, he is suitable (and humorously) overwhelmed.  Some of the events are absurd enough that they make the reader laugh even without character involvement.  However absurd the events are, though, they are realistic in the world that Baker presents.  I had no trouble suspending my disbelief for any of it.<br />One word of warning for those who wish to browse just one of the stories in the bookstore:  The stories are not individually titled and there's no way to distinguish where one ends and another begins other than reading.  Read the whole book, as it's well worth it.  While each story stands on its own, they do read better as a whole, with events in one story influencing the next.<br />Other than the occasional blunt message as noted above, there really isn't anything noticeably wrong with The Anvil of the World.  Baker has further cemented her place as one of the best authors of the genre, showing that she can handle fantasy just as well as science fiction.<br />David Royreally isn't anything noticeably wrong with The Anvil of the World.

US	50332419	R27GUE13KC71U1	0743435923	541218661	Pyramid Scheme	Books	3	9	12	N	N	What the heck is a 5-sided pyramid?	I work at a university, and while I enjoy my job, nothing really groundbreaking ever happens here.  Life goes on, making the news here in Canada at times, but nothing world-wide.  Sure, we have our academic scandals, but nothing really big.  One thing that has never happened is a pyramid that has traveled through a wormhole crashing into the library.  Now that's unique!<br />Thus, my university is nothing like the University of Chicago.  In Eric Flint and Dave Freer's Pyramid Scheme the university has to deal with an alien pyramid.  Not only does it wreck a perfectly good building, but it's making people disappear as well.  Unfortunately, one thing it can't make disappear is trite dialogue and poor characterization.  While the book is fun, there's no substance and the characterization is questionable at times.<br />This pyramid is an alien artifact, a parasite that attempts to dominate a planet by using its mythologies and belief in order to goad them into using nuclear energy against it.  The military is called in to deal with it, and people start disappearing.  Some of them come back, though they are dead or dying when they do, but one group in particular doesn't seem to be coming back at all.  A ragtag bunch of soldiers, professors, and workmen were all snatched together, and they discover themselves in a world of Greek myths come to life.  They have no idea how to get home, and only professor Jerry Lukacs really knows the myths and the language well enough to get by.  They have to fight and think their way through the hazards (they land on Odysseus' ship and encounter some of the hazards that he faced in The Odyssey) and try to figure out a way to get home.<br />Meanwhile, others back home are trying to figure out what this pyramid is and how to deal with it.  The military, as usual, wants to try and blow it up.  It's expanding and becoming even more dangerous.  They get some rudimentary information when somebody returns but usually that person is dead or dying, so they can't get much.  They muddle around some, there are some conflicts between the scientists and the soldiers, but nothing much is done.  Will our heroes be able to fight off a bunch of angry gods and the force behind them?  Or will they fall victim to the ultimate pyramid scheme?<br />Pyramid Scheme is a fluffy book.  Sure, there's some quite graphic violence in it, but it's mainly a romp through some of our ancient myths.  There is some sense of danger to the main characters, but it's pretty obvious who's going to live and who's going to die (though one character, rather than dying, just disappears and is never really referred to again).  Thus, we get to enjoy the events in the novel with the main characters.  Freer and Flint use a lot of basic mythology and then twist it.  They're also able to combine bits and pieces from several eras, as the alien device is not that choosy.  Thus, myths from different Greek time periods merge into one, as well as a few Egyptian myths.  It's obvious the authors did a lot of research into this aspect of the book.<br />I enjoy a good romp, and that's why I'm rating Pyramid Scheme as high as I am, but the book really suffers if you give it even the most cursory scratch.  Characterization is basically a series of either jokes or arguments between the characters (Jerry and Lamont commit the most atrocious puns, for example), but it's all surface.  Each character has specific traits that set him/her apart from each other, but deep down they're pretty much all the same.  Liz DeBeers suffers from this the most.  She's from South Africa and is a visiting scholar at the university because her husband is there.  Aside from a few references to Pretoria and other South African details, though, you couldn't tell that she's from anywhere different from anybody else.  I got no sense that she was not American, despite the fact that she supposedly hasn't been in the country that long.<br />Another problem with the book is the male/female relationships.  All of the women (even the mythological ones who become members of the party) end up pairing off with one of the guys.  I can see that harsh situations may make attractions that may not otherwise have happened, but all of them?  It's simply too much, and not believable.  In fact, the only character who isn't paired up (male *or* female) is the one who has a spouse waiting at home.<br />As far as the plot goes, I did find some of it questionable, especially the ending (though I loved the creative use of &quot;pyramids&quot; that sparked the ending).  The actions of  the characters and the sequence of events during the climax just boggled my mind.  News crews just don't act that way, for one thing.  I can't go into detail without spoiling the ending, however.  Another problem is that the situation back in Chicago ends up having nothing to do with the resolution.  It adds a bit of tension to the proceedings as we start to figure out what is going on, but once the book finishes we realize that they were just going through the motions. It was a bit aggravating.<br />Still, despite the many problems, I found myself reading &quot;just one more chapter&quot; quite often and I did enjoy the book.  If you don't like myths at all, then this book is not for you, as there is nothing else in the book that will grab you.  Diehard myth fans may find the book a bit too frivolous with what they love.  Personally, I had a lot of fun imagining what it would be like to interact with these mythological characters, from Odysseus to Zeus and everyone in between.  Let your mind go, and you may like this one.  Just don't scratch the surface.<br />David Royationships.

US	50332419	R39PC6PLBCCD1G	0671028405	327925438	The Lives of Dax (Star Trek Deep Space Nine)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Loving the slug inside you	One of the more interesting characters in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is a Trill named Dax.  Trills are humanoids who are hosts to slug-like being called a symbiont.  In a process called &quot;the joining,&quot; Trills have the symbiont implanted and they become not just the person they were, but also a sum of memories that can go back hundreds of years. There were two &quot;Dax&quot; characters in Deep Space Nine, with Jadzia Dax being killed in season 6 and Ezri serving as an emergency host.  It's a great honour to be a host, but not everybody is anxious to be one.<br />I've always been fascinated by the Dax character, even when the actresses weren't quite up to the part.  The show would occasionally have references to previous hosts through the centuries, and I often wondered what some of their stories might be, especially during the time of the original series and movies.  Marco Palmieri shared this feeling, and he decided to create a short story anthology addressing this issue.  He gathered some of the big names in Trek fiction and created The Lives of Dax.  Each of the previous Dax hosts gets one story, showcasing their personality and a little bit of their history.  The stories are pretty good, though none of them are particularly earth-shattering.  It's a nice, cozy tome that will bring a bit of nostalgia to any DS9 fan.<br />Some of the more interesting stories take place early in Dax's life, before Trill became acquainted with the outside universe.  The first one (not counting the beginning of the framing story) is about Lela Dax, a new member of the Trill council and one of the advocates for opening Trill up for trade with other galactic races.  A ship has approached Trill and sent a message that the Trill are having trouble translating.  It appears that the ship is in trouble, and they are ignoring all warnings from Trill that they must leave orbit.  Lela decides that she has to help, despite what the council says.  She discovers, and demonstrates to the rest of the council, that knowledge is not only power, but that the lack of it can be deadly as well.  &quot;First Steps&quot; is by Kristine Kathryn Rusch, and starts the anthology off with a bang.<br />Once this story is off the ground, though, the book suffers from one of my main criticisms of the Trek books (though I think many fans disagree with me, which is why it will never change).  Each story brings in some known element of Trek lore (usually a character or a race), ostensibly to give some sort of identification to the reader (like we don't know already that it's a Trek book?).  These elements are usually contrived and really drag the book down in my estimation, unless they're used well.  Unfortunately, that's not usually the case here.  Tobin Dax's story (&quot;Dead Man's Hand&quot; by Jeffrey Lang) brings in the Romulans.  Emony Dax's story (&quot;Old Souls&quot; by Michael Jan Friedman) has Dr. McCoy from the original series (though it is actually established in the television series that Dax had an encounter with him, so at least it's not coming out of left field), Audrid's story (&quot;Sins of the Mother&quot; by S.D. Perry) has Captain Christopher Pike, of the old Enterprise. Finally, Torias's story (&quot;Infinity&quot; by Susan Wright) has Captain Styles and Cadet Saavik, from Star Trek III.<br />While I applaud the fact that these aren't just name references but actual characters used, they still feel shoehorned into the stories for name recognition.  There's no reason for Saavik to be in &quot;Infinity&quot;, as she's never shown any inclination for experimental warp drives.  The only one of the above stories where it actually makes sense to include the character is Friedman's, and that suffers from its own blandness.<br />That's not to say the anthology isn't worth reading.  With the above caveat, it actually is quite an entertaining read.  The stories are interesting (especially the Curzon story, &quot;The Music Between the Notes,&quot; by Steven Barnes) and the framing sequence is really good.  Ezri spent the entire final season of the television show very unsure of herself and her role as a joined Trill (she never wanted to be joined, and had no preparation) and her heart-to-hologram talk with Vic Fontaine (the holographic lounge singer) is very well-done.  His holographic sentience gives him a unique perspective on her problems, and it's a very good lead-in to the story of Dax through the years. There was even an intriguing use of Verad, the Trill who stole the Dax symbiont from Jadzia for a few hours.<br />There really isn't a bad story in the bunch, though a couple of the stories suffer from being relatively uninteresting.  It's a shame that Friedman's story is one of those, as it had the most potential.  Seeing Dax's meeting with McCoy should have been wonderful, but instead it was &quot;ok.&quot;  The writing was a bit stiff and it didn't really fit into the conceit of Ezri telling a story to Vic.  Instead, it was a lesson for McCoy about dealing with interstellar species (this is in his Academy days).  Also, it is told from McCoy's point of view, going directly against the concept of the anthology.<br />I greatly enjoyed The Lives of Dax, and I think it would be a wonderful addition to a Trek book collector's shelf.  If you've ever wondered about Dax and her past lives, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.  If you're thinking of starting some of the Trek books, it's a good place to get a sampling of some of the big names in Trek today and to see if they're writing is your cup of tea.<br />My previous host's memories tell me that you'll like it.<br />David Royn Barnes) and the framing sequence is really good.

US	50332419	R338YQGAN4V4SS	0441010970	615318877	The Wrong Reflection	Books	4	10	11	N	N	The face in the mirror is not mine...	One of the most basic traits of our humanity is our identity.  Our identity is made up of our history, our memories, our personality and our relationships.  But what would happen if you woke up one day and all of that was gone?  You look in the mirror and you don't recognize the face that is staring back at you?  You're in a hospital but you don't know how you got there?<br />The Wrong Reflection, by Gillian Bradshaw, is a science fiction thriller that begins dealing with this issue.  Bradshaw is primarily known for writing historical fiction using her classical background.  Whatever possessed her to try her hand at science fiction, I have no clue.  However, she succeeds brilliantly using the talents that her previous genre no doubt taught her (I have not read any of her other books).  She creates vivid characters and ties them into a tight thriller that makes you keep turning the page as you wonder what's happening.  Unfortunately, the ending can't keep up the steam, and she uses a grammatical conceit that becomes increasingly aggravating.<br />The first half of The Wrong Reflection is a brilliant mystery, with Paul knowing even less than the reader.  This makes the book even more enjoyable as you try to unravel what's going on before Paul can.  The tension mounts as Sir Philip keeps trying to get Paul to check into a medical facility run by Stellar, and Paul knows that something is going on.  But every time he starts to remember, he doubles over in pain and has a severe bout of nausea.  I found myself wanting to read \\"just one more chapter\\" when I should have been going to bed.  It was engrossing, and I really felt sorry for Paul and his predicament.  Sandra was an intriguing character as well, feeling obligated to find out how the man she rescued is doing, and then sensing a kindred spirit, a man who wears his logical mind as a badge, and a man who is scared of everything around him.  She becomes his anchor to the world, and also his lifeline.  His memory is strange as he can remember many scientific things, but he can't remember how to put on pants (I found that part a little illogical, though it's slightly explained once the secret is revealed).<br />As the mystery is revealed, it becomes a standard \\"misunderstood alien is used and abused by an evil corporation for fun and profit\\" story with a scientific twist, lessening the impact.  The villains are rather stereotypical, with Lloyd being the worst of the bunch.  He believes his heart's in the right place but can't see why what he's doing is wrong.  Other characters are less so, being far more interesting.  There's a Michael Moore-like documentary director (though more honest) named Rod, and his lover and cameraman, Dave.  Thankfully, nothing is made of the fact that they are gay, becoming just part of their characters rather than an agenda.  Malcolm, the black home-nurse who is initially brought in to take care of Paul, suffers from this a little bit more.  He is a well-rounded character, but his race becomes an issue when he asks Sandra if the fact that he's black is why she won't be with him (despite the fact that she's obviously already in love with Paul).  This bit is just thrown in there and batted aside by Sandra, making the reader wonder why it was even there in the first place.<br />Bradshaw's writing is excellent, drawing the reader in with her words and making even the slower second-half of the book seem much better than it really is.  Her prose is really well done and she writes with great economy.  There's only one problem, and it may be a personal issue with me.  I found the constant movement from one viewpoint to the other very annoying.  Bradshaw moves from Paul's viewpoint to Sandra's and then back again, all within the same section of the book.  Thankfully, these are the only two viewpoint characters she uses, or it would get even more confusing.  I found it very discombobulating when I was reading Paul's thoughts and then all of a sudden I'm reading Sandra's.  I know expert writers can break the rules, and that this can even be effective, but I don't think it was this time.  It was distracting, and it really detracted from the book.  Considering how great the rest of her writing was, I found it even more disappointing.<br />I can't say much about the science aspect of the novel, as I don't know a lot about magnetic fields and singularities.  It sounded good enough to suspend my disbelief, which is all I ask for in a science fiction novel.  It doesn't get very technical, so if hard science turns you off, you don't need to worry about it.  Bradshaw explains it well enough so that you can understand it<br />The Wrong Reflection will keep you reading, despite the fact that it limps to the finish line after a wonderful start.<br />David Royandra's.

US	50332419	RBSAJ67VRA38Q	0759658919	167770894	Jay: A Spiritual Fantasy	Books	5	6	7	N	N	An amazing book about a hypothetical religious question	One of the age-old hypothetical questions that Christians ask themselves is &quot;If Jesus returned today, would we recognize him?&quot;  The common fantasy is that he would return as a homeless man and everybody would treat him like dirt, and nobody would know the difference.  Or maybe he would be put in an asylum with all the other people who have claimed to be Jesus, along with Napoleon and Hamlet.  Usually it stops there, with an admonition to treat the less fortunate than us better than we do, since they could very well be the return of the Messiah.<br />Jay: A Spiritual Fantasy, by Louis Gruber, doesn't go in that direction, though some of Jay's naysayers do think that he is insane.  The book begins with advertisements left on the car windshields of various religious figures: an Episcopalian reverend, a Catholic priest, a Unitarian minister, and so on.  The messages, along the lines of &quot;Come follow me&quot; and &quot;Come when I call you,&quot; are followed by detailed instructions of where to meet.  A man who introduces himself as Jay slowly convinces them all that he is the coming of Christ, and that they should follow him.  They are full of doubt at first, but one by one he heals them of various ailments, speaks what's in their mind, and shows them how to pray effectively.  They form a following, one that starts to expand as time goes on and word gets out.  The press starts printing stories that take everything he says out of context to paint him as an occult figure or a loon.  Jay's time with his flock is limited, however, and he has to teach them as much as he can before that time is up.  He stresses that following him will be fatal to some of them, but that if they love him, they must persevere.<br />Jay is a parable of sorts, a comment on how humanity has spent too much time on the trappings of religion and ignored the substance of it.  Jay mentions many times in the book how he doesn't want people to classify themselves, but instead to be as one with all.  People worship objects that are said to represent him but instead have lost contact with him.  His following starts asking him questions about Jay's previous visit, asking him about hell, if he really performed miracles, etc.  He continues to avoid their questions by saying that the answers don't matter.  That only he matters.  &quot;But you see, they do not worship me.  They worship their thoughts of me.&quot;  The representation of Jesus in this book is amazing.  He's always laughing, with the ghost of a smile on his face even when he's being serious.  He finds himself a slave to the power of ice cream, and they are always meeting at Zippy's to have a bowl of ice cream while they talk.<br />Being a parable, there really isn't much characterization in the book.  I had a bit of trouble keeping the characters and their vocations separate in my mind, with only a one character (Angie DeWayne) standing out, mainly because she's not a member of the clergy.  Jay is a force more than a character, and we rarely see anything from his point of view.  Instead, we get the other characters' reactions to him.  Given the type of story this is, however, that's ok.  The story uses the characters to emphasize its points, and it's all the better for it.  Each character plays his/her role in the story and we don't need to know more than that.  There is also a Mary Magdalene character of sorts (conveniently named Mary) who wants to experience Jay in the flesh, but she is quickly rebuffed.<br />The one thing I was mildly disappointed with is the fact that the story is not well-grounded in place or time.  It takes place in the South, but in an undetermined location.  We get no sense of the world around what's happening, other than the ice-cream vendor wondering if this meeting of people, one of who looks vaguely Middle Eastern, might be a terrorist plot.  Instead, the setting is almost surreal and self-contained.  The only references to the press or the outside world are in howthey see this &quot;Laughing Jesus.&quot;  This does manage to keep the story focused and perhaps more powerful, so I'm sure it was intentional on Gruber's part.  It's not really that big of a fault, and is more of a personal preference than a knock against the story.<br />Otherwise, Jay is amazing.  Whether you are religious or not, this story will affect you, with only the most jaded cynics able to ignore it.  No matter what denomination you are, it will make you think about the way you worship, and wonder if you are placing too much emphasis on thoughts and beliefs and not enough on what those beliefs are supposed to represent.  If you have no denomination, it may just get you to think about how you treat people, or how you are treated.  Either way, this is a valuable book to read.<br />David Royow they see this &quot;Laughing Jesus.&quot;  This does manage to keep the story focused and perhaps more powerful, so I'm sure it was intentional on Gruber's part.

Right?  That's not necessarily so, as the British showed in the German invasion of Crete.  John Keegan's Intelligence in War uses this as just one example of how intelligence is used in wartime and how it's not always the end-all and be-all of how a battle is won.  Keegan explores the entire gamut of intelligence and how it's been gathered and used in modern warfare, using examples ranging from Admiral Nelson's chase of Napoleon's fleet on its way to Egypt in 1799 to some World War II examples.  He finishes the book by discussing modern techniques that range from Vietnam to the war on terrorism.  Put it all together and you have a fascinating book that turns the historical stereotypes on their head.<br />&quot;Its theme is that intelligence in war, however good, does not point out unerringly the path to victory.  Victory is an elusive prize, bought with blood rather than brains.  Intelligence is the handmaiden not the mistress of the warrior.&quot;  Pg 5<br />Methods of intelligence acquisition range anywhere from &quot;humint&quot; (the acquisition of intelligence through human means, usually spying but also including local knowledge of the area) and &quot;sigint&quot; (the interception of signals, whether radio satellite, or just seeing the semaphore flags).  As technology has increased, the use of humint has decreased as more signals, and more ways of intercepting those signals, have been developed.  The problem in the past has always been conveying the intelligence found to your superiors before it becomes outdated.  The first case study, Nelson and Napoleon, demonstrates this completely, with Nelson getting increasingly outdated information, making some choices based on false assumptions of what he knew, but ultimately prevailing because of a decisive mind willing to take a chance on suppositions based on that intelligence.  Keegan does an excellent job here showing the troubles Nelson had to go through to even get what he had.<br />Other case studies include Stonewall Jackson and his Shenandoah Valley campaign (demonstrating local area knowledge), the chasing of the German surface fleet in World War I (the interception and use of wireless signals), the battle of Crete (how intelligence doesn't always win the battle), the battle of Midway (the breaking of Japanese codes), the battle of the Atlantic (how intelligence was just one part of the defeat of the German submarine fleet), the German V-1 and V-2 rocket campaign against Britain (how human intelligence became very important) and then an evaluation of military intelligence from 1945 to today.  He finishes with a conclusion that sums the whole thing up, that war is not won just by intelligence, but by brute force.<br />The broad examples Keegan uses to illustrate his point takes the reader gently along the path to understanding.  He first shows some instances where intelligence was instrumental in helping the winning side succeed in their action (Nelson surprised the French fleet at Alexandria and destroyed it).  He then shows us Crete, and how the British knew almost the entire German plan, but misinterpretation of parts of it kept the local commander from deploying his forces correctly, causing the loss of the island even though the Germans lost 40% of their paratroopers.  This brutally enforces Keegan's notion that intelligence is nothing without the blood and sweat necessary to make use of it, or how that same blood and sweat given by the enemy can overwhelm even a prepared force.<br />Even without the intelligence theme running through the case studies, they are fascinating history.  Keegan tells the story completely even as he uses the chapter to illustrate his point.  While at times the entire chapter is illustration (the Nelson chapter continually refers to the intelligence that Nelson had received and figured out), other times he seems to abandon the theme and just tell the history (the Jackson chapter and the Battle of the Atlantic).  Doing this in the Atlantic chapter reinforces the fact that, while intelligence was important in the fight against the submarine wolf packs, it was the sailors who were the most important in winning this particular battle.<br />Keegan's research is top-notch, though there are times you wonder about the variety  (or lack thereof) of sources he uses for a particular chapter.  The number of  &quot;ibid&quot; notations can be quite alarming sometimes, though he always uses at least five or six sources for any one chapter.  I do notice that there aren't any primary sources (though some of the notes say &quot;quoted in...&quot; so the text he is using as a source may have been using a primary source).  While this is an issue, I don't think it's a major one in this case, however.  He is not trying to tell a definitive history with his case studies, but instead to use them as support of his thesis about intelligence.  Thus, he's not trying to get into the heads of parties involved.  Some people may have a problem with that, however.<br />Keegan's style is very easy for the layman to read.  The chapters flow effortlessly, and if you have any interest in the subject whatsoever, you should find yourself intrigued.  You may not agree with him, but you will not have any trouble getting through the book.  It is not dense at all.  It's a thick book, at almost 400 pages before notes and bibliography.  However, you will find yourself breezing through it so it doesn't feel that long.  Personally, I couldn't put it down, but Keegan always entrances me with his writing.  It's no different from any of his other books that I've read, so if you've found that you can't stand his writing, this book won't be any different and you should probably pass on it.<br />Read this book, and discover just how important intelligence is in warfare, and how sometimes it just isn't enough.<br />David Royapter and the Battle of the Atlantic).

US	50332419	R44GUS4F9J164	0756401577	936950714	The Sorcerer's Academy	Books	3	9	12	N	N	It's just like Harry Potter, but it's not.  Really!! Kind of	&quot;Gee, this sounds just like Harry Potter.&quot;  That was my first thought when I picked up The Sorcerer's Academy, a collection of short stories edited by Denise Little.  Indeed, in the introduction, Little brings up that very point, though she mentions that there has been a long line of &quot;learning to be a wizard&quot; books even before our bespectacled friend came about.  Little acknowledges that Harry Potter is popular and decided she wanted to see what an American wizardry school would be like.  Thus, she came up with the concept of an Academy in the desert of Arizona, near Sedona.  She also brought a bunch of friends along for the ride.  The result is a series of stories that are hit or miss (as many anthologies are).  Thankfully, there are more near misses than there are stories wide of the mark.<br />Little has gathered an impressive array of mid-list fantasy and science fiction authors to contribute stories.  The book starts with a story by Josepha Sherman, introducing the concept of the school and the three main students of the Academy for Advanced Study (or, as the students call it, Sorcerer's U):  Barry Silverhorse, Janice Redding, and Matt Johnson.  They have a small adventure as they are trying to get to the Academy for the first time, but it's pretty inconsequential.  It does set up a plot thread that sounds like it's supposed to run through (or at least in the background of) the rest of the stories, but it never really comes up again until the &quot;final exam&quot; piece by Sherman that ends the book.  It does a good job of introducing us to the three students, though, as Sherman does an impressive job of characterization.<br />While the beginning isn't the most impressive, the last story (Sherman's &quot;Final Exam&quot; is only one page, so I'm not including it in the count) is a standout story.  Written by Von Jocks, &quot;Parenthetical References&quot; starts out with an English class all receiving very low marks on a research paper (not exactly the most exciting idea for a story).  It turns into a wonderful character piece starring Cassi, a girl who doesn't talk (it's unclear until the ending whether or not she can but won't talk, or if she is incapable).  She feels ostracized by the other students and she is having trouble fitting in, but she's included in a study group to help improve their papers.  She finds out the true meaning of friendship &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; magic during their studies.  She's initially unsure if they are just accepting her as a burden to their study group or if they are truly interested in being her friend, and snide remarks from other girls in the class don't help.  It's a wondrous revelation when she truly does become part of the group, as well as when we find out exactly what the secret is behind her silence.  It's a perfect capstone for the book and should have ended it rather than &quot;Final Exam.&quot;<br />Other good stories include P.N. Elrod's &quot;Dream Date,&quot; where a student discovers that the subject of her wildest fantasies (both love and musical) is secretly staying at the Academy for some mysterious reason, but is he as squeaky-clean as his image?  &quot;License to Steal&quot; by Mel Odom is an excellent story of an outsider (a young thief in Sedona) who gets coerced into trying to steal something from the Academy and finds out that he may just have a home there.  The characterization of the boy is wonderful, though the villains are a bit clich&eacute;d.  There are no particularly bad stories in the book, though a few are just forgettable.  In fact, looking through the book to write this review, I didn't even remember reading &quot;Sleepwork,&quot; though I did remember bits and pieces of it so I know I did read it.<br />There are two main problems with The Sorcerer's Academy.  First, and more minor, there are some continuity issues between the stories, mainly having to do with rules.  Students spend some time in the first few stories traipsing around Sedona, but then in &quot;Freshmen Mixer,&quot; we're told that students cannot leave the Academy grounds unaccompanied their first semester.  That rule is mentioned in another story, but subsequent stories also have them leaving campus occasionally.  Another continuity issue is that one story establishes that computers are housed in a special building that's protected because magic can have a bad side effect on them.  Later, there's a reference to Janice having a laptop in her room.  Little details like this added up and marred my enjoyment of the book.<br />Secondly, though, The Sorcerer's Academy didn't do enough to shy away from the whole Harry Potter idea.  The fact that the main three characters are two boys and a girl, and the girl is the most studious of the bunch, gets too close for comfort.  That in itself would not have been a problem, except that these three are obviously the main characters, even when the stories don't always concern them.  Even the stories that have a different main character include at least one of these three as a &quot;friend&quot; of the main character (something that Robert Sheckly thankfully avoids with &quot;A Salty Situation&quot;).  There are far too many stories that are just about them, as well.  It also didn't help that at least two stories made direct Harry Potter references (one had a student say &quot;I don't want to be Harry Potter!&quot; and another mentions the increase of movies showing magic in a good light recently).<br />All in all, this was an enjoyable anthology that doesn't do enough to distance itself from its forebears.  The stories are quick reads and I am glad I read them, but most of them fall just short of being great.  The attempt to tie the stories into some overarching story and theme doesn't really work, but if you can ignore that, you can enjoy the stories for what they are.<br />David Roydona, but then in &quot;Freshmen Mixer,&quot; we're told that students cannot leave the Academy grounds unaccompanied their first semester.

US	50332419	R3VNMQEE6NHCNH	019280300X	798543732	The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940 (Making of the Modern World)	Books	5	44	45	N	N	Do the French really surrender regularly?	Much has been written about various aspects of World War II, but books continue to come out.  Some do re-evaluations using new information, some take a different look at old information and try to show it in a new light.  Julian Jackson has written a very interesting book on the German invasion of France in 1940, called (simply enough) The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940.  In it, Jackson attempts to show his version of why France fell, and whether or not it was inevitable.  Were the Germans just too powerful?  Was the new Blitzkrieg warfare just too much for the incompetent French soldiers?  Jackson uses personal memoirs, eyewitness accounts, and diaries to provide this vivid account of six weeks of hell.  Not only that, but he places the fall in historical context.  Put all together, and it's a fascinating book.<br />First, Jackson tells the story of the invasion.  He breaks this down into four narrative chapters that explore this from a different angle.  The first one contains the military aspects of the defeat.  The second looks at the relations between France and its allies, mainly Britain (though it does examine other countries, such as the support pact with Poland).  This examines how the British and French looked at each other, along with how they cooperated in war (and how they fought amongst themselves as well).  The third chapter looks at the political aspects of the defeat, while the fourth looks at the French people.  Then Jackson brings them all together, looking at how they all relate to each other, and shows how each one can be seen as part of the defeat, but yet none of them can be singled out as the main cause.  Finally, Jackson looks at the consequences of the defeat, including how it coloured French thinking for years to come, even reaching as far forward as today.  Much of French foreign policy has referred back to this time in their history.<br />I was really impressed with the way Jackson told the story.  His writing is very evocative and his use of sources from memoirs of generals and politicians to the common soldier is extremely well done.  I have read a few books on this aspect of the war (or that have included it, anyway), but never have I heard from the soldier's point of view.  This is becoming the norm in World War II history books recently (see An Army at Dawn), and I like it.  I think it gives us a better picture of warfare and how it affects the soldiers who are fighting it, rather than just dry strategy and tactics.  That's not the only thing that's good about it, though.  Since Jackson is examining the defeat from multiple sides, it wouldn't have been surprising to see him tell the story of the invasion and then look at the other aspects of it, thus having some narrative repetition.  Jackson avoids this, seamlessly linking the chapters so that they tell a continuous story, even as he looks at the different points.<br />The most interesting part of the book is when Jackson is looking at the different causes of the loss.  The standard is to blame the horrible French military, calling them cowards and (as the stereotype goes) saying how easily the French surrender.  Mosier's The Blitzkrieg Myth places a large portion of the blame on the British.  Jackson shows, however, that the main reason was the bad intelligence that the French had, which caused them to send their best troops against a German feint.  He takes pains to point out that there was no one specific cause, however.  He agrees with Mosier that the British pulling back didn't help, and he mentions the refusal of the Belgians to coordinate defense strategy with the French and the British until after Germany invaded (they had declared neutrality).  The coordination between British and French forces was not the best either.  Thus, the situation was more complex then many claim.  The French soldier fought with &eacute;lan when he didn't feel abandoned by his superiors.<br />I also found the historical context fascinating.  Jackson doesn't just tell the reader about what happened, but he examines the next 50 years as well, and how the Fall affected France.  French historians still don't talk about it much, and when they do discuss it, it's more of a condemnation of the Third Republic government before the war than anything else.  Jackson's book does much to alleviate that problem.  To many, the Fall of France was an inevitable result based on the \\"decadence\\" of France in the pre-war era.  Jackson refutes that brilliantly, saying that the war was actually quite winnable if executed properly.<br />It's hard to find any real faults with this book.  While nothing is perfect, any problems I had with the book are so niggling as to be unmentionable.  It is a very short book (only 249 pages, not including notes and bibliography), but it feels deep.  I could have hoped for even a bit more depth, but Jackson uses the scale marvelously, packing a lot of information and evaluation into these 249 pages.  There is no padding, and little extraneous information included.  Between The Fall of France and The Blitzkrieg Myth, I've found some fascinating short history books, and as long as they don't read like summaries, I hope that this is a trend.<br />If you are at all interested in World War II, this is a book that you should pick up.n't just tell the reader about what happened, but he examines the next 50 years as well, and how the Fall affected France.

US	50332419	RWRE1EK4DCAA6	0743449126	116944393	3: Tong Lashing: The Continuing Adventures of Sir Apropos of Nothing	Books	4	8	10	N	N	You'll never look at Asia the same way again.	I'm a big fan of puns.  The more I groan, the better I like them.  Peter David must feel the same way, because he's been responsible for a great many of the best groaners around.  In fact, I haven't seen anybody make a pun like he has, because he not only makes the joke, but then he makes something useful out of it.  It's a rare talent, and one that really makes his books worth reading.<br />Which brings us to Tong Lashing (see what I mean?), which is the third book in the Sir Apropos of Nothing series.  The first book, also called Sir Apropos of Nothing, introduces us to the wonderful but extremely self-centered Apropos, a man who won't stick his neck out for anybody.  David then gives us The Woad to Wuin, which brings Apropos to the land of Wuin, where he learns that he can sink to even further depths.  David says in the acknowledgements that Apropos's future is up in the air.  If that's so, it makes me sad, because he unfortunately didn't end it on a great note.  Tong Lashing is still a very good book, but the tone is wildly variable, ultimately making for a disappointing finish.<br />I find myself with completely mixed feelings about this book, and I'm not sure if it's just me not getting the ending or what.  The book is wonderful, with colorful characters, wonderful dialogue and witty asides (the book is told in first person, so the asides are written by Apropos).  It's everything I loved about the first two books, and the jokes are even better then those.  Up until the last 100 pages, I was going to call this the best of the three.  Everything was just clicking, and I couldn't stop laughing, but yet being touched as Apropos learns even more about himself.  He's always been unlikable, mainly because he is the complete anti-hero.  In Tong Lashing, however, he starts moving beyond that, and showing that he can actually care for somebody.<br />But then the climax starts, the book all of a sudden turns very dark.  This is a pivotal moment in Apropos's life, and it's very well done.  He's brought down to the very bottom, the ultimate level of self-loathing as he realizes that he brought all of this death and destruction down on his friends.  He's determined to avenge them, and he hatches a plan to bring down everybody in Chinpan.  This is fine by itself.  While the tone is dark (there are no real jokes by this point), it is very effective.  However, then things go even worse, with a literally explosive climax that completely ruins the mood and tone of the book.  I think David went way too far in this one, and if he's trying to make some point, it went completely over my head.  This change in tone almost made my teeth clap together it was so sudden.<br />I can't say enough about how wonderful the rest of the book is, though.  Apropos is his normal self, but he has grown and the change is welcome to see.  He is still cynical, knowing that every time he is happy something's going to happen to bring it down.  Mitsu is the daughter of the Imperior, impulsive and headstrong in a society where women are not even second-class citizens.  She is a product of her upbringing though, and one of the sticking points between Apropos and Mitsu is her willingness to sacrifice her handmaidens when she is being punished.  We find out the secret of Mordant, and how he is able to talk.  The Imperior is suitably insane, and just when you think he's being stereotypically dumb, David pulls a twist out of his hat and shows us a villain who's both insane and kind of smart too.<br />And then, of course, there are the jokes and puns.  You've seen a couple of them in this review, and I don't really want to reveal any more.  Probably the best one is a take-off on the Ninjas of old Japan (if you have no plans to read this book, email me and I'll tell you what it is).  Peter David has a wildly humorous way of writing, though he is definitely somebody you'll either love or hate.  Basically, I can say that if you like puns, you will love his writing.  The jokescome fast and furious, and I loved reading about Apropos's feelings on life in general.  He talks directly to the reader, writing this in his old age (so yes, it's obvious that he survives everything).  Apropos often expresses his amazement that he still has readers, which can be a dangerous thing for an author to do.  But David handles it with aplomb, knowing that he's got his reader hooked.<br />The best part about his puns is that they are more than just puns.  He makes the Forked Tong a legitimate (and dangerous) criminal organization.  The Ninjas could have been used for a joke and then discarded, but they become an integral part of the plot, and characters in their own right.  Minor characters, to be sure, but still at least with two-dimensional.  The joke becomes part of the plot, rather than just a rim-shot.  Even the mad Scotsman Ronnell McDonnell actually gets a mention after he has strutted across the stage.  In fact, any gamer will love the sequence with McDonnell and the magical role-playing game.<br />Still, we have to get to the end, and I felt very unsatisfied.  It hit me like a two by four to the head, but not in a good way.  David had better write another Apropos book to wash the taste of it out of my mouth.  It is effective in one way, however.  Apropos ends the book truly as Sir Apropos of Nothing.  And he's finally satisfied with that.<br />I'm not, however.<br />David Royes come fast and furious, and I loved reading about Apropos's feelings on life in general.

US	50332419	R3RT1AWMABDXKI	0563538643	733127629	Heritage (Doctor Who)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Oh no...another dustball.	Heritage is a Dr. Who novel by first-time Who-writer Dale Smith.  It is extremely atmospheric and really delves into the characters, sometimes too much.  Character development is a wonderful thing but sometimes it gets in the way of telling a story.  Such is the case here.  Add a melodramatic ending to the whole thing, and you have a great attempt, but a so-so novel.<br />One of my favourite Doctor-companion relationships has always been the Seventh Doctor and Ace.  No matter what you think of the last few seasons of stories, you have to agree that the series tried to do something different with Ace.  She was made a dynamic companion, someone who doesn't scream, who changes and learns things in each story.  The individual writing of the stories may have suffered at times, but the idea behind Ace was wonderful.<br />The books have carried that further, creating a wonderfully rich relationship between her and the Doctor.  She sees herself as a companion (one of many, as she well knows), but she also sees herself as a student of the Doctor.  Thus, her first thought when the Doctor gets all moody and doesn't want to get involved on Heritage is that it's an initiative test for her, to see what she will do if left to her own devices.  This quickly subsides, however, and she starts to get seriously worried about the Doctor.<br />Smith examines this relationship very closely, with long, introspective sections of the book from both Ace's point of view and from the locals' seeing these two in action.  It can be quite interesting, though sometimes Smith overdoes it.  These passages start to drag on and on with no conclusion in sight, and you realize you've just read a couple of pages and nothing has happened.  It's a valuable tool, I just wish there had been a bit less of it.  The story, when broken down into its components, feels very insubstantial, and that's a shame.  However, I did like the atmosphere that the passages told from the locals' side gave to the book. It really brought back the &quot;who the hell is this guy?&quot; feeling that the very beginning of the television series evoked.  The Doctor is a mystery, wrapped up in an enigma (to borrow a phrase).  He should be presented like that at times.  These are the passages where the introspection succeeds handily.<br />Given the paucity of characters (there are only 7 Heritage residents who are on screen at all, which gives the impression that Heritage really *is* a ghost town), you would think they would be well done.  Unfortunately, that's a hit or a miss proposition.  While Lee and Cole are great, the Sheriff is fairly one-note.  He feels tremendous guilt about what happened, and how Wakeling and his goons have him under their thumbs.  As is usual in stories like this, he eventually gets a bit of a backbone.  But that's about it.  Wakeling and his cronies are the worst, though, evoking little interest in the reader and becoming very cardboard villains.  There is no reason that I can see to have Bernard be a sadistic dolphin in a walker with automatic weaponry in it, besides the &quot;wouldn't it be cool&quot; factor.  Sure, the fact that he needs a mechanical translator becomes an important factor late in the book, but overall it comes over as Smith trying to be cute.<br />Thus, Ace and the Doctor have to carry the novel, and they do a fairly decent job of it, however it's not flawless.  I guess the best word would be &quot;overwritten.&quot;  Smith tries so hard to examine these characters that you just want to tell him to get on with it.  He never really tells us why the Doctor has been moody for these long months.  As a continuing reader of the series, I got the impression that it was because of the fact that the TARDIS is carrying a coffin with Ace's corpse in it (a dangling plotline from a previous book).  However, that book was written by a different author and there's no clue that this book takes place right after it, so you're left hanging.  He does have the Doctor say that he's been thinking of hanging up the Save-the-Universe shoes and retiring, but he doesn't give any indication of why he would be feeling that way.<br />I haven't said much about the story, but that's because there isn't a whole lot to say.  It's your typical &quot;visitors come to Western town that doesn't like visitors and is hiding a secret and everybody's hostile to the heroes until the heroes finally reveal the secret&quot; kind of story.  It's been done many times, and this story doesn't add a lot to it.  The prose is pretty good, but not outstanding.  It's a fairly quick read and if you're a Doctor Who fan, it will give you a sense of nostalgia (especially if you're fans of the 7th Doctor).  Otherwise, though, there's not much meat to it.<br />This is your typical middle of the road Dr. Who novel.  It won't make you a fan of the show if you're not already one.  If you didn't like the 7th Doctor, then you will probably find the relationship and overwriting to be very tiresome.

If you didn't like the 7th Doctor, then you will probably find the relationship and overwriting to be very tiresome.  If you like the 7th Doctor, it's a passable read.<br />David Roy	2004-01-08

The ultimate objective was Rome, mainly for the propaganda coup that would benefit whichever army entered it first.  When the Allies invaded, many Romans thought that they would be liberated in a matter of days.  The Fascist government had been toppled and there's no way the Germans would try to hold Rome and fight in southern Italy.<br />Right?<br />The Battle for Rome, by Robert Katz, tells the story of a city that awaited that \\"matter of days\\" for 9 long months.  Nine months of resistance activity, starvation, and oppression that battered the city's soul and resulted in the deaths of many, including almost the entire Jewish population.  The sub-title of the book is \\"The Germans, The Allies, The Partisans, and the Pope.\\"  Katz examines all of these aspects of the Italian campaign, meshing them into a seamless narrative that's both provocative and fascinating to read.  Well-researched and extensively documented, Katz makes use of many sources that have just come to light, including documents recently declassified by the CIA.  He uses these to greatly criticize Pope Pius XII and his handling of the Roman situation.  Katz doesn't examine the complete attitude of the Vatican toward Hitler's \\"Final Solution,\\" but he does examine the attitude as it pertained to the round-up of Jews in Rome after the Germans occupied it, as well as its reaction to the massive reprisal that killed 335 Romans after a particularly effective Partisan attack.  The Vatican (and especially the Pope) comes out of this wanting.<br />Not only was Pius silent in his criticism of the Holocaust, not only was he silent as the Germans systematically rounded up the Jews who were supposedly being protected by the Vatican, but he was silent as the Germans clamped down on the population of Rome, including one of the worst massacres in Italian history.  Katz points out that, even if Papal silence in the face of the Holocaust facing Europe may have been \\"understandable\\" at times, what awaited his personal flock in Rome deserved some sort of outcry that never came.  Instead, he sacrificed everything for a myth of an \\"open city\\" where no military presence was allowed.  The Germans, while agreeing to this concept, ignored it when it came time to move troops to the front.  Instead of protesting this, however, he criticized the Roman partisans for breaking the peace when they attacked.  Instead of criticizing the Germans for cracking down on partisans, he instead blamed the partisans for it. The Vatican has been very reluctant to release documents from its archives pertaining to World War II, especially documents related to the Roman occupation.<br />Katz doesn't just tell the Vatican side of the story, though, and he doesn't just criticize Pius.  He also tells of the Allied blundering in the Italian campaign, from the non-breakout of the Salerno beachheads that resulted in long months of fighting against Kesslering's various defensive lines, to the invasion at Anzio that, with a little bit of initiative, could have resulted in the fall of Rome in January, 1944.  He uses the diary of General Mark Clark, the American general who eventually took Rome, very extensively, commenting on the relationship between him and his superior officer, General Alexander.  Katz does not go into great detail on the fighting, though there is enough to understand what is going on.  Instead, he concentrates on the politics of the Italian Campaign, the need to be the first to enter Rome and Churchill's attitude toward the whole thing.<br />Finally, Katz uses his contacts with some primary figures (OSSspy Peter Tompkins and Rosario Bentivegna) to detail life inside Rome, the partisan activity that took place there, and the endless political struggles between the various partisan groups that almost destroyed the Resistance from within.  He uses personal stories in this case, including the diary of a Vatican nun and testimony from the trials of the various German figures within the city.  Sometimes, Katz does make too much of an aside about the personal lives (especially Rosario and the woman who later became his wife) which distracts from the historical narrative, though it does add a bit of tension to the whole story which is kind of nice.<br />Katz weaves all this together into a narrative that is, at times, disjointed.  He bounces around from the Vatican to the partisans, then takes a breather and talks about the Allied armies advancing (or, more often, not advancing) on Rome.  This is a really effective way to tell the tale, especially all of the relationships between the various parties and the events in Rome, but it does grate at times.<br />The Battle for Rome is compelling, thought-provoking, and chilling at times.  Katz spends a whole chapter on the reprisal for the partisan attack on the Via Rasella, telling in great detail about the round-up of the prisoners, taking them to the caves, and then shooting them five at a time.  He details this from the German side, and it presents a picture of men who are revolted by what they are being ordered to do, but do it anyway rather than speak out.  It really is quite intense, and the description may not be for the squeamish.<br />The Battle for Rome is a fascinating book that should be read by anybody interested in the subject.

In the Presence of Mine Enemies allows Turtledove to take a break from his other series and do a self-contained novel set in the normally cliched world where the Germans won World War II and are dominating everything.  I say \\"normally cliched\\" because Turtledove actually does a good job of making it seem fresh and interesting.  It is the early 21st Century.  The Germans and the Japanese won the war, cities in the USA were nuked in a second conflict after the European one ended, making the United States agree to be subjugated, paying tribute money every year to Berlin.  Everybody figures that the next war will be against Japan for final control of the world, but for now an uneasy peace settles between the two empires.<br /><br />Jews have been eliminated from most of Europe, but like the cockroaches the Germans in this novel think they are, hidden infestations are everywhere, including right under there noses.  This provides most of the story, as we are told of a society of hidden Jews who are working amidst every-day Germans in Berlin and elsewhere.  The main character, Heinrich Gimpel, works for the Wehrmacht (the German army) as the man in charge of keeping tabs on the American money that gets sent to Berlin every year.  At the beginning of the book, the ritualistic revealing of the family Jewish secrets to 10-year-old Alicia Gimpel occurs.  When the parents think they are ready, their ancestry is revealed and they are absorbed into the conspiracy of silence.  The children have to adjust to the raging anti-Semitism around them as well as changing their own feelings, because they have been indoctrinated with all of the anti-Jewish hate and must learn that they are the people who most other Germans consider the devil.<br /><br />Turtledove does an excellent job of telling the intensely personal story of this family along with the story of massive political change in Germany.  Momentous events around the world sit beside the normal affairs and other personal problems that we all have, not to mention the secrets that the Gimpels and their friends are hiding.  While sometimes kept to the background of the story, the specter of their ancestry is always hanging over them, even as events move to perhaps eventually allow them to admit in public what they've hidden for generations.  Even when Turtledove seems to forget that aspect of the story as he tells of the politics (especially toward the end of the book), something often comes to the forefront as a harsh reminder of just what's at stake.  Heinrich is caught up in the political changes but has to guard himself, lest he reveal their secrets in a rushed reaction to the world changing around him.  He knows that with one misstep, extermination awaits him and his family.<br /><br />I was really impressed with the economy of viewpoint characters Turtledove uses.  He uses the three Gimpels who are aware of the secret (two younger children don't know, which provides a lot of the conflict for Alicia, as she can't tell them but has to put up with, in silence, the anti-Semitic statements made by them) along with three other Jews who are in their circle of friends.  With these characters, he is able to tell their story, a story of political change, as well as the deeply personal story of a troubled marriage and the effects it has on the Gimpels as Heinrich becomes the object of affection for a frustrated wife.  Usually, Turtledove has so many characters that it's hard to keep them straight.  I have always felt that this is probably why Turtledove insists on introducing them constantly almost every time they appear in the book.  However, that reasoning must be faulty, because there are only six of them and he still insists on doing that.  It became very aggravating.<br /><br />One thing I did find amazing is that Turtledove does manage to avoid most of the pitfalls his books usually fall in to.  Sure, there is the introduction of characters mentioned above, but at least Turtledove makes everyone of them interesting.  It's almost heart-breaking watching Alicia struggle with the new knowledge she has gained, having to silently accept all of the statements made against her new-found people by her younger sisters as well as everybody in school.  She finds it incredibly hard to absorb this new information and not reveal it to others through actions or, worse, inaction.  Your nerves actually clench a little bit when the fighting between Heinrich's friend Willi and his wife Elena almost results in an affair that could jeopardize not only Heinrich's marriage but also accidentally reveal their secret.  There are no useless characters in this one, and even the minor characters attract the reader's interest just enough to not be annoying.  Turtledove also avoids the gratuitous, badly-written love scene.  He effectively fades to black a couple of times and even the one that he does include doesn't concentrate on the details.  I applaud him for this, as it really has been a weakness of his in the books that I've read.<br /><br />His prose is still wooden enough to give a woodpecker a woody, but it's not too bad this time around, probably because he's avoided most of his other problems.  The climax of the book, while pulse-pounding as change sweeps through Germany, is so obviously a copy of the fall of another Evil Empire that it becomes very predictable.  It's to Turtledove's credit that he makes the book interesting despite this, though by this time you have enough invested in the characters that you want to keep reading despite knowing what's going to happen.  Inertia perhaps?<br /><br />In the Presence of Mine Enemies is an excellent book of alternate history, and probably the best book I've read by him.  Give it a shot, even if you've found his other series to be a waste of time.  This one isn't.<br /><br />David Royalmost heart-breaking watching Alicia struggle with the new knowledge she has gained, having to silently accept all of the statements made against her new-found people by her younger sisters as well as everybody in school.

The Joy Device is a Bernice Summerfield novel by Justin Richards, who is one of the masters of the Dr. Who genre books.  Most of the Bernice books have been extremely funny, even when they're being serious.  This one is played just for laughs, though, and Richards plays it up like a gem.  Being the penultimate book in the range, I guess Richards felt that he had to go for it all.  While the joke does go on a bit too long, it's still a hilarious book.<br />I've always been a big fan of Bernice, both with the Dr. Who books as well as her solo adventures.  It's sad to think that this is the next-to-last one published by Virgin.  Richards delivers a wonderful book, though, full of the trademark humour and strong writing that he's famous for.  The situation Bernice finds herself in (though she sometimes doesn't realize it) is almost too crazy to believe, with events happening all around her but she is unaware of them (thanks to some timely intervention by her friends).  There's a laugh on almost every page, whether it's Jason's (her ex-husband) attempt to keep a purse-snatcher from bothering her or Jason trying to make sure she doesn't sleep with Dent, or many other zany situations.  Richards doesn't make the jokes too obvious, and he has the perfect cast of characters to cover them all.<br />First, there's Bernice and Dent.  Bernice is Bernice, often sarcastic and just in need of a breather.  Dent is an adventurer, and Richards really fooled me on whether or not he is the man he claims to be.  He is mystified by what's happening (or, in this case, not happening) and the holiday he promised Bernice is turning to mind-numbing boredom.  Every time things start to go the way he's expecting them to, they all of a sudden reverse themselves.  While he is not a funny character, his reactions are almost the straight man to everything that is happening, and he does a wonderful job at it.<br />Then there's Jason and Clarence.  Clarence is an angel (or passes for one, anyway) who is very innocent.  He's not used to all this skullduggery, and Jason gets him involved in a lot of it.  He's wonderful, fake moustache and all.  But it's Jason who steals the show, constantly coming up with impromptu plans to get in the way of disaster happening to Bernice, and making sure that she doesn't know that he's been involved.  He's the one who always ends up in danger, and he handles it with aplomb.  He hasn't changed a whole lot from previous Bernice books, as he's still incredibly possessive of Bernice but knows that if he expresses it publicly, she'll rip his equipment off.  At the beginning of the book, they're still arguing like they did when they were married, with neither side allowing the other any leeway.  Jason and the others can't allow Bernice to know they don't want her to go, mainly because the reason they don't want her to go is because she may find that she likes it out there.  Being the person put in charge of making sure she doesn't, Jason is a pleasure to read about.<br />The villains of the piece are typical comedy villains.  Ruthless to an extent to make things dangerous, but mostly comic characters where there is no violence to be had.  They threaten everybody, and there is some gunplay.  Overall, though, there's not a lot new about them.  They aren't one-dimensional, but they aren't exactly full-blooded.<br />There are a couple of problems with the book, but they don't detract enough for me to lower my rating of the book.  First, the joke does go on too long.  I didn't realize when I started the book that the joke *was* the book.  I thought it was just an aspect of it, but no.  It was fine until the conclusion, when Jason was desperately trying to keep Bernice and Dent apart.  By this time, I was tired of it and found the whole sequence annoying (though taken by themselves, the scenes were wonderful).<br />Secondly, there is a bit of a logic problem, something that I don't usually associate with Richards, even in a comedy.  Bernice isfinding the whole thing boring, but there is a running battle in the hotel with the bad guys trying to get the prism, shooting up the place and everything.  While Bernice is under the effect of the Prism, there is no indication that it affects her memories of what happened.  Sure, she's under its spell when she calls the whole thing &quot;a misunderstanding,&quot; but then when she's no longer under it's effects, she still calls the Rim boring and says that nothing happens.  I'm sorry, but even if it is a &quot;misunderstanding,&quot; being shot at and having explosions go off all around you doesn't sound like nothing happening.  I found Bernice's blas&eacute; attitude toward the whole thing at the end a little mystifying.<br />Still, this is a wonderful book.  It's funny and reads very quickly.  Other than it's setting, it's not even really science fiction, so don't avoid it if sci-fi turns you off. It's an adventure, through and through.  And did I say it's funny?<br />David Royis finding the whole thing boring, but there is a running battle in the hotel with the bad guys trying to get the prism, shooting up the place and everything.

It's a cracking good debut, too. Marred only by a questionable ending, it's a fun ride until you get there. Even then, the ending is more \\"convenient\\" and confusing then outright bad.<br />The Book of the Still is something that should not exist. It's a book that acts as a lifeline for time travelers. If you're trapped, just find the book (it exists in all time zones), write your name in it, and you can be instantly rescued as other time travelers find your name and location. Whether its existence is due to the strange time effects taking place since The Adventuress of Henrietta Street is unclear. Whatever it is, the Doctor has been suffering some weird physical effects from his proximity to it since landing on Lebenswelt. He's been fainting, experiencing different psychological problems, etc. So he tries to steal it in a high-tech burglary that unfortunately goes awry.<br />Anji despises Lebenswelt and wants to get away as soon as possible, and she's greatly worried about the Doctor and his 20 year prison sentence. Fitz finds himself fitting in to the party lifestyle that exists on the planet, falling back into his \\"'60s groovy\\" persona until he falls into the wrong crowd. He falls in love with Carmodi, a woman who also has designs on the book. When Fitz disappears, Anji is beside herself wondering what she is going to do to rescue the Doctor, find Fitz, and get off the planet before things go from bad to worse.<br />So, of course, things fall apart before she can do any of that. Who are the Unnoticed? And why are they willing to destroy whole worlds to prevent the book from falling into anybody's hands? The Doctor tries desperately to keep as many people alive as possible while still making sure the flow of time is not damaged. But can he do both?<br />Paul Ebbs has been involved with Who fandom for quite some time, but this is his first professional publication in the genre. At times, you can tell, as a bit of prose falls flat or a character seems a little off (or, even worse, pointless). However, you can also tell he's been a fan for a while now, as he glories in our favourite characters and tells a funny yet interesting tale using deep time-travel theories (especially paradoxes). The prose is not beautiful in an aesthetic sense, but it is a joy to read. He has a way of describing things in pop-culture concepts, especially when he's telling things from Anji's point of view. While this doesn't help if you don't understand the reference, it makes a for a hilariously funny read when you do. Especially good is Anji's comparisons of Rhian to Daphne/Velma from Scooby Doo.<br />That's what Ebbs adds to the mix of the Eighth Doctor adventures. Humour. Sure, Trading Futures was a James Bond romp, but before that the book range has been deadly serious with an almost complete lack of the funny stuff. The Book of the Still does more than enough to compensate. The narration is very light, and the sections are very short and punchy, making for a quick read. I did get a bit annoyed at Anji's constant running-together of words (\\"ignorantstupidknuckledraggingsexuallyunconsciosthrowback\\" for example), but it was manageable, and perfectly showed her constant frustration at the whole situation.<br />In fact, Anji isn't the only one that Ebbs gets right. Fitz finally has a real romance (well, real to him, anyway) without the Doctor's involvement. While the romance itself may not be real, his reactions to it are. Unfettered by his long experience with the Doctor, we get to see Fitz as he would be if he wasn't being a cosmic hobo. Meanwhile, the Doctor himself is pretty good as well. He scrambles around manically trying to fix everything, being mysterious at times as well as unsure of himself (continuing the amnesia storyline that's been going through the Eighth Doctor books for awhile now). Watching these three characters interact withthe others (they're not together much in this book) is a real treat.<br />Ebbs doesn't do quite as good a job with the other minor characters (some of them so minor that they don't even get names, just \\"mayor\\"). While Rhian is fine, I didn't really like Carmodi, which is a shame considering that she's the driving force for one of the plots in the novel. She's irritating, perhaps even more so because she writes the epilogue at the beginning of the book (yes, the beginning...don't ask) and practically begs the reader to not judge her too harshly. I'm sure part of my feelings about her were intentional on Ebbs's part, but we're not supposed to be so irritated by a character that we don't want to read more about her. Unfortunately, that was true of Carmodi.<br />Finally, we get to the ending. I won't spoil it here, but it basically makes the previous 250 pages meaningless. People speak of the reset button on Star Trek television shows. While The Book of the Still wasn't quite that bad (our characters are still affected by it), it positively reeked of this. This fact is all that saves it. On top of that, though, the ending is a bit confusing. I can't go into detail without spoiling it, but I'm still not sure I understand it.<br />All in all, The Book of the Still is a fun read that is well worth checking out by the discerning Dr. Who fan. Don't let the ending get to you, and maybe you'll understand it better than I did. If so, then you'll enjoy it even more. If not, then at least you'll have had a fun trip on the way there.<br />David Roywith the others (they're not together much in this book) is a real treat. <br />Ebbs doesn't do quite as good a job with the other minor characters (some of them so minor that they don't even get names, just \\"mayor\\").

Fear of the Dark is a Dr. Who novel by Trevor Baxendale.  It's his fourth Dr. Who novel, and the first one to involve a different Doctor than the eighth.  Baxendale does an excellent job with this one, creating his very own Who horror novel with some chills and a tight cast of characters.  It's only marred by an ending that seems to take forever and some wooden characterization.<br />Baxendale is known for his traditional Who stories, and this one is no different.  One can imagine the dank cave sets, perhaps wobbling a little bit as they were wont to do on the television show.  It has a limited cast, and even fewer actual speaking parts.  The only thing that couldn't be done is some of the special effects, and even those may have been able to be faked.  Yes, this is televised Who on a book budget.  And you know what?  I loved it.<br />One of the things the television series often had going for it was atmosphere.  Fear of the Dark has this in spades.  It's spooky and it's (yes, this word will keep coming up again) dark.  The dank mood of the caves just wafts off the page, and when one of the characters is completely cut off and alone in the dark (there it is again!), I could feel my own gut clench a little bit.  Even when the characters are in bright lights, the book still feels a bit dimmed.  Baxendale does a very effective job in conveying this, and the mood is perfect for what Baxendale is trying to show us.  It's positively chilling when the Dark is siphoning away any visible light, and we watch as even open flames slowly dim until they are just embers, and then finally even these go out.<br />Often, when books go for an atmospheric effect, they do so at the expense of the characters.  Baxendale is bitten by this bug, unfortunately.  Then again, he could be going for the horror movie effect, where the cast is limited and nobody outside the inner circle is given any characterization whatsoever.  While this may be true, it doesn't really work in a book.  Some of Stoker's men have a few lines, a brief bit of characterization, and then they're gone.  Cannon fodder is the term, I believe.  It gets worse when the ship arrives and Baxendale adds even more faceless people to go with the two new full characters.  In fact, we don't even know what happens to some of the crew, though it's obvious by implication. They just disappear and are never referred to again.<br />There are a few exceptions to this, though.  Stoker is definitely the best of the bunch, alternately suspicious of the Doctor and then relying on him when it's clear he has a better grip of what's going on then she does.  We learn a lot about her in the course of events, and I really enjoyed reading about her.  Less well-done, though still effectively, are Lawrence, Bunny, and Cadwell.  Cadwell has his own agenda but he seems a bit too stereotypical at times.  Bunny is given lots of background, but it is sort of stereotypical as well.  He has left his family for one final mission with Stoker, and he constantly misses his daughter (though no mention is made of him missing his wife, which is interesting).  Lawrence actually is given more then the stereotypical tough-guy captain role, especially his interplay with Stoker.<br />However, it's the regular characters where Baxendale shines.  The Fifth Doctor, so hard to get right in print (especially when compared to Peter Davison's performance of him on the show), is excellent.  He's kind and considerate of his friends but just slightly tetchy.  He's irritable at times, especially when things are starting to go wrong.  Basically, he's so in-character here that it becomes obvious when something is happening to him and he starts doing weird things.  With anybody else, the characterization would be so off that we would believe it's just the author messing up.  Here, it's obvious what's going on and a little bit scary.<br />Tegan and Nyssa are excellent as well.  Nyssa is innocent yet quietly competent.  Tegan is a mouth on legs,but you can tell that she genuinely cares about people, especially her friends.  She is willing to die for her friends if need be, and while she does feel fear, she is willing to do what it takes to save them.  The novel takes place right after the television episode &quot;Arc of Infinity,&quot; where she has met up with the TARDIS crew after being abandoned by them at Heathrow Airport 6 months before.  Thus, the book delves deeply into her psyche as she determines what her place is within both the crew itself as well as life in general.  She wants to do something with her life, and as scary as traveling with the Doctor can be sometimes, she hasn't felt alive like that since she was stuck back on Earth.  She wants to help people, and she will always get the opportunity to do that when the Doctor is around.  I loved her character in this book.<br />I haven't said a lot about the plot of the book, but that's mainly because it is stereotypical of the genre.  A small group of people are terrorized by a malevolent force and must defeat it to survive.  The ending confrontation drags on a bit too long and I started to get bored, but otherwise the book was one that I couldn't put down.  Sure, the plot is a stereotype, but when it's done well, I don't care.  This book grabbed me, and while it almost let me go at the end, it was definitely worth the read.<br />David Roybut you can tell that she genuinely cares about people, especially her friends.

Some fantasy novels are epic, with rich plot lines, multiple characters on a quest to save the world from some hidden magic or powerful being.  These books can be a lot of fun and very interesting, though often the plot overshadows the characters.  Other fantasy novels are light and fluffy comedies where nothing much happens but they make you laugh your tail off.<br />Finally, there are those fantasy novels that really defy description.  Tooth and Claw, by Jo Walton.  As the dust jacket says, this is a novel that is based on the Victorian novels of Anthony Trollope.  Walton takes the Victorian setting, and gives it huge twist: all of the characters are dragons.  Yes, that's right.  Fire-breathing (though not all of them do) lizards that can fly (though not all of them can).  And, most importantly, proper fire-breathing dragons who have formed a society based on class structure, money (especially gold and treasure) and arranged marriage.  Walton takes this concept and writes an intriguing story of family honour and love.  It's a real treat to read.<br />The plot description doesn't sound very interesting.  I think that's because this sort of plot usually does nothing for me.  It does sound rather dull, doesn't it?  I would not have read this book if I hadn't both received this as a review copy and been a big fan of Jo Walton.  However, I'm glad I did, because I think it transcends the genre and becomes a nifty little (256 pages) novel in its own right.  When I say &quot;transcends the genre,&quot; I'm speaking as somebody who has not read any Victorian fiction, so Walton may be way off in her homage.  However, Walton is good enough that I trust she hit it pretty good.<br />The conceit that dragons are living in a Victorian-style society is simply a wonderful concept that Walton does a lot with.  She adds the proper-sounding customs and traditions (dowries, arranged marriages, family honour and the like), and then mixes that with touches of her own (the eating of the dead to make the rest of the family stronger, the binding of servants' wings so that they can't fly away and the ritual binding of the wings for religious figures) that simply add to the fantasy element but still blends favourably with the Victorian style.  Every once in a while, you forget that you're reading a book about dragons, and then Walton will mention something about wings, flying, or the size of the dragons and you'll remember that she's talking about beasts that can reach up to 40 feet long.<br />Walton tells the tale with the gentleness and humour that, I imagine, most Victorian novels have.  Her prose is again wonderful, making the genre conventions her own and putting her own spin on them.  At times, the narrator of the piece intercedes to speak directly to the reader (something else that may be a genre technique, though I don't know), bringing a humour aside or clarifying a point that the reader may have missed.  I thought this would be distracting, but it doesn't turn out to be.  I would call the whole style of the book &quot;pleasant.&quot;  There are a couple of deaths, but only one through violence and even that is not vividly described.  Thus, it is not a page-turner, and you have to lose yourself in the writing or already be a fan of this type of story in order to make it through.  If this style bores you and you find you're not entranced by Walton's evocative writing, then even 256 pages will seem too long.<br />I haven't said anything about the characters yet, and that's mostly because there isn't a whole lot to say.  They fit what I imagine are the genre character roles they are supposed to fit:  women who are either looking for their place in society or who have already married and found their place, men who are either conceited in their status or just trying to make their way in the world as well as find a suitable woman to marry and have a clutch of dragonets with, servants who try not to be noticed (or, in the case of Daverak's servants,eaten), and local religious figures who are either soft and noble (Penn) or pushy and arrogant (Blessed Frelt).  Walton does a great job with all of these characters, making us care about them and letting them stretch the bonds of their Victorian roles without losing the basics of them.<br />There is nothing deep or meaningful about Tooth and Claw, and nothing earth-shattering in its presentation.  Instead, we get a delightful story that reminds us of old times, washing over us with a feeling of nostalgia and a quieter time.  If you're a fan of Victorian novels, you'll probably like this one despite the fact it's about dragons.  However, I don't think the reverse is true.  I don't feel myself drawn to any other stories like this, and it's Walton's ability to bring me into the fold that makes this book a standout.<br />David Royeaten), and local religious figures who are either soft and noble (Penn) or pushy and arrogant (Blessed Frelt).

Robert King has done some magical things to the King Arthur mythos.  Now, King continues his Arthurian story, in Le Morte D'Avalon by giving us the conflict between nature and warfare.  This time, having told the story of Merlin and Lancelot, King gives us the story of Morgan Le Fay.  Does King pull off a third great book?  While it's interesting, it's nowhere near the level of the first two. A lackluster ending makes it even worse.<br />As is common knowledge to anybody even semi-familiar with the Arthurian legends, Morgan is Arthur's half-sister who bears a son with him, Mordred.  King expands on this, making Morgan become an incarnation of Gaea, the earth-goddess.  Morgan foresees that her half-brother will bring nothing but strife to the land, and that he must be destroyed before he can do that.  Camelot, rather than being the paradise portrayed in the legends, will instead be the catalyst for some of the darkest times in history.  Ever since the fall of Gaea, men have subjugated women and brought nothing but violence and war to the land that was once green and lush.  She is determined to bring it back, starting her own earth religion that works toward this end.<br />As she continues her machinations against Arthur, she happens upon Lancelot, who she discovers is the &quot;perfect consort&quot; of a goddess like she is becoming.  She is determined to win him to her side, and she becomes increasingly jealous when she finds out about Lancelot's fascination with Guinevere.  This jealousy colours many of her interactions with both of them (as well as Arthur) for the rest of the book.  It also causes her to make decisions she wouldn't normally make, jeopardizing her plans.  Will she achieve the paradise on Earth that is her goal?  Or will the representatives of Christianity and the Faerie folk defeat her?<br />While the concept of this book is intriguing, I thought the execution was flawed.  This is not so much because of how King presented the whole scenario, but because many of the events are just rehashes of what he put in the first two books, just told from a different side.  At times, this works (such as Morgan's first attempt at winning Lancelot, when she and her two disciples try to woo him into their lair), but at others it really becomes boring.  The ending sequence in particular (No spoilers) is tedious, with Morgan mainly observing events that happened in the previous books.  She provides some commentary, but she's not involved.  The ending jumps from event to event with no real continuity.  Whole sections of the previous books are discussed in a few pages and then the book just limps into nothingness.<br />While I'm discussing the ending, there is a really nice coda that really ties the series together.  I thought that Lancelot du Lethe was the ending, and that it really worked well that way too.  Adding Morgan to the mix, it brings an even more satisfying conclusion, as character arcs are wrapped up and the people involved move on with their lives/afterlives.  I could have done without the very last pages, though, where King brings a modern-day spin to the gender issues that he's explored throughout the book, though.  They seemed trite and unnecessary.<br />This brings me to the main fault of the book, in my opinion.  The gender politics are very heavy-handed in this one.  First, the main struggle is between the &quot;male&quot; religion of Christianity and the &quot;female&quot; religion that Morgan sets up (and becomes the embodiment of).  Thus, most of the men in the book are either would-be attackers or emasculated men, while most of the women characters are noble and honorable.  Some of this may be because of the viewpoint we get (it's all Morgan's), so the shading may be understandable.  Arthur and Lancelot are the only two men who don't fall into this trap.  Arthur is pretty much a non-character, being the focal point of Morgan's schemes but not interacting with her much.  Lancelot is the &quot;perfect consort&quot; so must appear like a beacon of nobility.  King does turn this whole idea on its head later in the book, demonstrating that the world still needs what men bring to it, and that a world dominated by a Gaea-like paradise would be, though very green, very cold and sterile.  It's a nice contrast, but it's hurt by the fact that there are no sympathetic male characters in the first part of the book.  It all appears to be a bunch of male-bashing, and twisting it at the end doesn't help the beginning.<br />Morgan herself is well done (until she becomes just an observer, at least, when she becomes boring).  She walks the fine line between the villainess that we're all familiar with and a sympathetic character.  King doesn't do as good of a job with any other characters, however.  Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot are based on their portrayal in the other two books, but unfortunately you only get that if you've actually read them.  Taken alone, they are woefully underdone.  None of the other characters are remarkable in the slightest.  King does a decent job with the writing as well, though his prose doesn't rise to the level that he reached in the first two books.<br />While, in hindsight, a book about Morgan is almost necessary to complete the series he has started, Le Morte D'Avalon almost feels written as an afterthought.  It doesn't read anything like the first two and it seems to be more of a rehash of events than is absolutely necessary.  If you've liked the first two, this is a valuable conclusion to the series.  But I'd buy it in paperback at least, if not waiting for the library.<br />David Royconsort&quot; so must appear like a beacon of nobility.

According to The Blitzkrieg Myth, the German army was superior to other armies, especially where training and officer experience was concerned.  Mosier quotes sources that say that every German soldier was equal to about 1.2 Allied soldiers, and 2 Russian soldiers.  When Germany lost the war, it was not because of quality, but more because of strategic errors made by proponents of what has become known as Blitzkrieg (Mosier calls it \\"Breakthrough\\").  Advocates of this strategy believed that infantry had had its day and that tanks and other armoured vehicles were the future of warfare.  Despite what historians have been saying for years, Mosier thinks that this is all a myth.<br />Mosier certainly presents his case well.  The Blitzkrieg Myth is meticulously researched, with extensive notes where he not only quotes his sources, but often also tells how accurate those sources are.  He is not afraid to quote sources he doesn't agree with, and then present his facts to show why he disagrees with these sources.  The notes are laid out in a very clear fashion, attached to the end of each chapter rather then all gathered at the end of the book.  The layout of the book is very easy to read, and it's very easy to keep track of Mosier's notations.  For once, I actually followed each one instead of giving up in frustration.<br />Mosier tackles two \\"myths\\" in this book: the power of armoured warfare and the power of strategic air bombing.  Mosier shows that, despite what we have been told, Germany did not have a clear superiority in tanks at the beginning of the war, and that the Germans did not subscribe to the \\"Blitzkrieg\\" strategy to invade Poland and France.  Instead, he demonstrates how a large portion of German military funding before the war was spent on fortifications on the French frontier, much like the French did with the Maginot line (and which the French have historically been criticized for doing).  Thus, German tanks were small in number (the French actually had more, despite conventional wisdom) and many were obsolete when the war started.<br />He also demonstrates that German military doctrine was far different then many have believed.  They did not use armoured spearheads to inflict panic on Allied rear areas.  Instead, they used a broad-front strategy, attacking in many different places at the same time, overwhelming the defenses and making it so they couldn't react. When they did attempt the Breakthrough strategy, it never worked or caused huge casualties when it did work (like the airborne drops on Belgium and Holland).  In point of fact, Hitler was one of the few Germans who believed in the Breakthrough doctrine, and he attempted to use the strategy once he took over military affairs.  He tried it twice (Avaranches in France and the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium), and both times resulted in the hastening of the German defeat. Allied generals who tried the strategy inevitably found that the Germans were able to quickly shift defenses to halt the attacks.  If Hitler hadn't wasted German resources on futile offensives, the Germans could have held on a lot longer than they finally did.<br />Mosier also attacks the concept of strategic bombing in the book, making a vivid case for how immoral it was.  This was because it didn't work, but ended up killing hundreds of thousands of civilians anyway, despite having no real effect on the war.  He shows that German industrial capacity did not go down in 1943, when the bombing process really began.  It did start going down in 1944, but a large part of that can be attributed to the loss of natural resources in areas where the Allies were taking back territory and depriving the German war machine of these resources.  Mosier attempts to discredit those who say the bombing campaigns contributed to the ending of the war, and criticizes those who massage the numbers (or completely ignore them) to make it look like it did have an effect.<br />The Blitzkrieg Myth is laid out very well and is easy to follow.  It's compelling reading and you will find yourself rethinking many of the things you thought you knew about the war.  While the book is excellent, there are a couple of mild faults with it.  First, he stays away from the Eastern front completely, only talking about the Soviets when it comes to their war with the Finns. Instead, he concentrates on Poland, Scandinavia, France, North Africa and Western Europe.  He comments on Italy and states quite often how erroneous it was for the Allies to invade it when the real war would be won in France, but he doesn't concentrate on it (though he does keep referring to the waste of Allied lives there).  He does mention the fact that most of the battles with the Soviets would only strengthen his arguments, but it would have been nice to have him show that.  At 312 pages, this book could stand to have been expanded to include it.<br />Secondly, he spends a lot of time defending Montgomery, one of the most disliked British generals in the war.  This is not a fault, as Mosier goes far to prove that Montgomery was, instead, one of the most misunderstood generals, but sometimes he overemphasizes it, going out of his way to clear his name.  Thankfully, he does acknowledge Montgomery's shortcomings, especially when it comes down to Operation Market Garden, the ill-advised plan to drop airborne troops in Holland to take a bunch of bridges, and then have an armoured spearhead drive up the road to meet them.  That's what makes this a minor fault rather than a major one.<br />All in all, this is a very interesting book to read if you are at all interested in World War II.  Even if you aren't convinced, it will make you think, and re-evaluate what you know about the war.  Give it a try.<br />David Royl and is easy to follow.

It's fall, and the trees are gloriously orange, brown, and gold, the colours vibrantly hitting your eyes and washing over them.  You think to yourself, &quot;I could travel through here forever and it never would get old.&quot;  Then, you hit the state line, but that's ok.  The author of such beauty doesn't need to worry about arbitrary boundaries.  He will continue to produce this breathtaking sight despite that.  And sure enough, as you keep going down the road, the trees are the same, the mountains in the distance are the same, and you are content.  Then, you start to notice something strange.  The trees are cardboard cut-outs.  The beautiful prairies surrounding you and leading up to the distant mountains look pleasant, but are really mud-filled and don't bear up to closer examination.  As you drive along, you notice that this is seeming more incredibly fake with each passing mile, and all of the cut-outs are the same.  Before, each tree was its own creation, but now it's not even a reasonable facsimile.<br />Those are my feelings in a nutshell about The Isle of Battle, by Sean Russell.  It's the second book in the Swans War trilogy.  The first book is beautiful, full of wonderful metaphors about stories and how we create them.  The second book, however, loses almost all of the magic of the first, abandoning the metaphor except for a few token references and concentrating on a war between ancient beings who have come back as avatars, inhabiting people in the present to continue their battle.  This book starts right where the previous one left off, and I was enthralled.  I even commented as such.  But then, everything started feeling the same, Russell started using other characters that I didn't care about, and most of the main characters are stuck in one locale for almost the entire book.  It started getting tedious, and the story metaphor that I so enjoyed seemed to have disappeared.  What could have happened to cause such drastic changes?  What's so different?<br />The more I read of this book, the more I missed the characters I had grown to love in the first book.  It's not that Russell does a bad job of characterization.  He doesn't change the characters without them learning something or being changed by events.  However, what he does is uses the surface of the characters that he had made so rich, making them part of a plot that doesn't really involve them, and doesn't make them grow.  They are fairly stagnant in The Isle of Battle, and Russell concentrates on this ancient war.  He doesn't neglect the situation between the Renn&eacute; and the Wills, however.  They still go to war over the Isle of Battle, and there is a battle scene or two.  Lord Carral, Elise's father, is fairly well-characterized, as a blind man who has forsaken his duty to his family for too long, and is trying to make amends however he can.  He had voluntarily relinquished the leadership of his family to his corrupt brother, and now his daughter is dead (he doesn't know she survives).  He is forced to make some hard choices and do some things he has never done.  He is one of the few characters who I actually liked more in the second book.<br />Most of the action between the characters we know takes place in a stagnant swamp, with constant descriptions of standing water, fog, beasts, and character wandering fill the text.  A lot of the time is spent despairing that they will get Alaan out in time, as they must get him to the river Wynnd to save him, and he's the only person who can get them out of this land.  More seemingly immortal characters show up, some interesting and some not, who have been involved with this war between the siblings for generations.  These sequences became repetitive very quickly, and the oppressive atmosphere that Russell describes becomes the mood of the reader as well.  That's not a good thing when an author is trying to capture his readers and make them wonder what happens next.  I got to the point that I didn't care.<br />It's too bad that Russell abandons his story motif, because it really made the first book interesting.  Lip service is given to it, as Cynddl repeatedly talks about the land they're trapped in, and how &quot;so many people's stories have ended here.&quot;  It's too little, however, and what there is of it also becomes quite repetitive as well.  In fact, that's the main problem of this book: repetition.  You start to feel like you've read the entire thing before, just a few pages ago.  The plot is so obvious (Hafydd is going to let them rescue Alaan and then follow them out so he doesn't get trapped there as well), that even the characters constantly remark on it.<br />There are two things that make this even remotely worth reading.  First, it's a continuation of what could be an interesting story, and there is hope that he can make the third book more interesting (though I haven't heard of a publication date, so who knows how long you'll have to wait).  Secondly, Russell still has a way with prose.  Even as he's battering you with the dreariness of the swamp, he's describing it so well that you feel like you're there.  His prose is a joy to read, it's just too bad that he had to wreck the story that went along with it.<br />Buy this one in paperback or get it from the library.

Every one of them means something to you at the time, though if it's not a very interesting story, it may fade into the mists of time.  If it's particularly interesting, and affects a lot of people, it may be recorded and become part of society's memory, which will allow it to live past the end of your life.<br />The One Kingdom, by Sean Russell, is a book that is about, ultimately, stories.  Neil Gaiman writes about stories and how they affect us, but Russell is writing about how we write stories with our very actions.  He wraps this in a story of his own, an epic yet strangely personal story about a group of young men from a remote village, out for a little adventure, who find a lot more than they bargain for.  Also included is a story about a young girl who is a pawn in an evil scheme, and a mysterious man who is trying desperately to avert a war.  Russell does a marvelous job of tying all these disparate stories together into a tight narrative, engaging the reader's interest as we wonder just how they are all going to come together.<br />Russell uses the ultimate story of two warring families to bring this unity.  The Renn&eacute; and the Wills have been divided for over a hundred years, with the land never having a true ruler.  Instead, it's just been two factions in an unsteady peace that's been rife with conflict and tension.  As the book begins, a murder is being plotted, as the cousins of Toren, head of the Renn&eacute; family, try to avert what they feel is a fatal mistake.  Toren is about to give back the legendary Isle of Battle to the Wills, who they took it from all those years ago.  The cousins plan to kill Toren to prevent it.  Meanwhile, plots abound on the Wills side, with the Prince of Innes allying himself with Sir Eremon, an evil knight with more to him than just an evil smirk.  Eremon has a long hatred of the Renn&eacute; and also lives for war, both of these coming together in the fact that his alliance with Innes will produce the armies he needs to make war on his bitter enemies.  He also plans to bring the Wills over to his side by forcing Prince Michael, the son of the Prince of Innes, to marry Elise, daughter of the head of the Wills family.<br />Russell uses these stories to illustrate the fact that we all have stories to tell or to live, or maybe just to hear.  He uses one more story to do this, by using the time-honored tradition of a group of people going out in search of adventure and finding that adventure isn't always something you want to go looking for.  Sometimes, you stumble into stories that you had no intention of writing, much less starring in.  Tam and his friends, Baore and Fynnol, meet up with a group of Fa&eacute;l (a band of gypsy-like people) who ask them to accompany a &quot;Story-finder&quot; named Cynddl down the river, to record its stories from generations long-past.  Ultimately, they stumble into all the intrigue and become pieces in a game that goes back hundreds of years.<br />The river becomes the metaphor of choice for Russell, and he uses it well.  The river represents all the stories that have happened along it, and the flow of the river represents the flowing of life as it goes by.  Sometimes it's rough (as when Tam and the others have to survive some raging rapids), and sometimes it's the ultimate in calm.  The small group journeys down the river as people come and go off of it, interacting with them along the way.  Slowly, the story unfolds around them and they get swept up in events.  The ending, set up by the mysterious man known as Alaan, is a blaze of action, mix-ups, misdirection, and interacting plots.  Is Eremon one step ahead of our heroes?  Perhaps that's how we get to the second book in the series.<br />While there are a couple of slow bits and seemingly pointless characters in the book,Russell does an effective job of keeping the pace moving and the characters at least mildly interesting.  Some of the characters (such as the man with his deaf and mute children that the group of heroes meets on a deserted island on the river) don't seem to have much purpose, though they are clearly set up for the rest of the series.  Russell succeeds in making us care about them at least a little bit, so we don't mind what seems like a pointless side-trip.  At times, he goes a little too far with the story metaphor, making it seem obvious and trite (he does go on about the river just a little bit too much), but overall I found the whole book fascinating.<br />Elise, is a woman who has always been bored by life, but she gets caught up in these events and has to learn what it takes to not only write your own story, but to write the story you want to write.  The reader really starts to care about this girl who started out seeming like a spoiled brat, even as Russell uses her to emphasize how we must wrest control of the stories we create, or the stories will write us instead.<br />Sean Russell is not a new face in fantasy fiction, but he's a new one for me.  I really enjoyed The One Kingdom, and am already deep into the second book.  If you want a grand, yet intimate, fantasy story with interesting characters and fascinating themes, this is a book you should pick up.<br />David Royve job of keeping the pace moving and the characters at least mildly interesting.

US	50332419	R18BMO58BSYLCS	074346401X	786069125	The Sundered: The Lost Era 2298 (Star Trek: the Lost Era)	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Parallel evolution at its best	The first book in the Lost Era series, The Sundered features Captain Hikaru Sulu and the starship Excelsior.  Most of you will remember that Sulu was shown to be in command of the ship in Star Trek VI, and I've always been interested in seeing what an adventure with him and his crew would be like.  In The Sundered, we see that he has a few familiar faces along with some crew members we haven't seen as well.  For me, part of the &quot;coolness factor&quot; of this novel is the fact that we get to see Captain Sulu in action.  Unfortunately, some weird pacing and jumping back and forth in history bring the book to a screeching halt every time it gets going.  Add a &quot;trial by combat&quot; clich&eacute;, and the book turns out ok rather then great.<br />First, it was good to see old friends again in new situations.  Sulu has assembled a number of known Trek characters to fill out his crew complement.  Janice Rand is now the communications officer, Christine Chapel is the ship's doctor, and Pavel Chekov is Sulu's first officer.  Also, as established in the Star Trek: Voyager television series, Tuvok is a member of the crew.  Not only was it great to see these faces, but Martin &amp; Mangels capture them perfectly.  They are the characters we all know and love, but they have matured.  Chekov is no longer the impulsive hot-head he was in the original series, but he can still remember that time.  When it comes time to discipline one of the crew, he remembers back to when he was a raw ensign, and it affects how he does it.  It's like the kids have grown up and are running the store.  Given the fact that these characters were small roles in the original series, there is no larger-than-life character that has to be given the hero's position.  In fact, the resolution of the whole story is sparked by somebody else, and what Sulu has to do is adapt it in order to solve the current crisis.  This is refreshing for those of you who are tired of seeing Jim Kirk solve every problem in sight.<br />While the known characters are done well, what about the rest of them?  The new crew members are top notch as well, though they are relatively few.  Only two of them actually have much to do, but they are great characters as well.  This is marred by only one thing.  The authors decide to make use of a situation from an old episode, where two of the crew are about to get married, but then one of them is killed in battle with the Romulans.  Not only does this happen again (except no Romulans, of course), but it's foreshadowed so bluntly, that the episode is actually referenced *before* it happens!  Rand thinks back to the last time two crew members were going to get married and remembers what happened to them.  The authors don't even change much of the story, having the death happen in the same place on the ship as the previous one.  While I appreciate the fact that Mangels and Martin took this story further (and actually tell a little sub-plot about revenge), the fact that none of the details are different is very lazy.<br />Another problem with the book is the awkwardness of the story-telling.  The book is broken up into parts, alternating between the current time and history (both of the ambassador and of several Earth historical points).  While I understand that the Neyel have a lot of history that can't just be infodumped, I found that the way it was done destroyed the tension in the book.  It didn't help that the characters within this history weren't that interesting.  I found myself wondering when the history lesson would end so we could get back to the actual story.  Just when the Sulu story really started to get interesting, they would switch back to the history.  They even include a scene in this history with Zefram Cochrane (the creator of warp drive) discussing things with the Next Generation characters that helped him in the movie First Contact.  This scene seemed entirely gratuitous, as it didn't seem to matter anywhere in the plot.<br />Other than that, though, the plot of the book is very intriguing.  The Tholians haven't been used much in Trek fiction, so it was nice to see them.  The current-day story is well-told and intriguing, though it's brought down by the clich&eacute; of Sulu fighting a trial by combat with the Tholian commander is really a groaner.  Thankfully, Mangels and Martin end it in a distinctive way, at least.<br />The Sundered is a flawed first book in the Lost Era series, but it's certainly worth reading if you're a Trek fan. The series has an intriguing premise, and if subsequent books can keep up the quality of this one (without the annoying bits mentioned above), then it should be a winner.<br />David Royther than that, though, the plot of the book is very intriguing.

US	50332419	R2C2MGR08CZCK4	0380979020	547078013	Paladin of Souls: A Novel	Books	5	141	146	N	N	Playing footsie with the gods	I've been a fan of Lois McMaster Bujold since I was entranced by her Miles Vorkosigan series a couple of years ago.  She has an interesting way of telling a story, combining fascinating characters with the ability to write action when the story calls for it.  I was sure that she could write fantasy as well, and she proved it with The Curse of Chalion.  Now, she has written a sequel of sorts, called Paladin of Souls.  And once again, she hits the perfect mix.<br />Paladin of Souls is a sequel only in the sense that the events in the book take place after the previous book.  Ista was the mother of two of the main characters in The Curse of Chalion, and she didn't figure that prominently in it.  Bujold takes her, a relatively undeveloped character except where the curse was concerned, and gives her a living vibrancy.  The reader can see why she went mad before, and why she is still seen as slightly insane.  But we can also see the inner workings of her mind, and see why she is like this and how she can sometimes use it to her benefit.  When one is touched by the gods, one is not unaffected, and Ista shows that effect.  She's in her 40s, most of her family dead and her daughter off ruling the kingdom, and she's bored.  She's also one of the only people who know the whole truth of what happened, and what lengths her family had taken to try and remove the curse.  The entire book is told from her viewpoint, so the reader also gets to see her reaction to the events and the people around her.<br />Ista's not the only wonderful character, though.  All of the characters in the book are three-dimensional, unless the book doesn't call them to be.  There's Liss, the messenger girl who Ista enlists to be her traveling maid (mainly because Liss doesn't treat her like an invalid who will kill herself the first chance she gets).  She mixes wonderfully with everybody, demonstrating how uncomfortable she is with the trappings of a royal court, but willing to do anything for Ista.  Her two soldiers at arms, Forda and Foix, are loyal to a fault, but also men with their own emotions.  Bujold makes great use of them as well, giving Foix a lot to do that a normal man-at-arms wouldn't get.  Bujold's great strength has always been her characterization, and it's this skill that makes even the slower parts of the narrative (there are a few sequences that seem to go on forever) interesting in themselves.<br />The plot of the book is just as good, with Bujold slowly unfurling it as she goes along.  Just when the reader thinks it's going one direction, it suddenly turns and goes somewhere else.  It starts out as a story of redemption for Ista, and while that ultimately is the point of the story, it redeems some of the other characters as well.  The fact that we care about these characters only adds to the strength.  Bujold keeps the story flowing, with only the aforementioned slow parts bringing it down just a little.  A couple of Ista's conversations with the Bastard (one of the five gods) drag a little bit at times, but the Bastard is such an interesting character that it's easy to forgive.<br />While the book is not filled with action and is a character-driven one, there are some great sequences that show she can handle fast-paced action as well.  Everything is vividly described, and while there is a lot of blood flowing at times, none of it is too grotesquely described.  There may be missing limbs, but nothing too outrageous.  One thing I thought was a little bit less well-done was the final battle, though.  It's a bit confusing at times, with events moving from the physical plane to inside Ista's head and then back again.  Overall, however, Bujold does a great job, immersing the reader in the book, and never letting go.<br />The writing style is simply gorgeous. I read the book very slowly because I was just reveling in it.  She captures the gentle humour of the characters along with the metaphysical aspect of the plot, almost making it lyrical.  Her prose has really matured since she started with Shards of Honor.  Don't race through Paladin of Souls to get to the finish line.  Instead, savour it.  Take your time and lose yourself.<br />I haven't read a bad Bujold book yet (there have been a couple sub-par books, but that's only when compared with her other stuff).  This is yet another winner.  It also almost demands a sequel (and she is writing another Chalion book), but perhaps she'll do what she did this time and go off on another tangent.  Wherever Bujold leads, I'll be right there waiting.<br />David Royrose has really matured since she started with Shards of Honor.  Don't race through Paladin of Souls to get to the finish line.

Sky Coyote is the second in &quot;The Company&quot; series of science fiction novels.  This time, the viewpoint changes from Mendoza, child of the Spanish Inquisition, to Joseph, her rescuer and recruiter.  Unfortunately, Baker is hit with a bit of the &quot;sophomore jinx,&quot; and her second effort feels lacking compared to the first.  Still a fun read, it could have been so much more.<br />Sky Coyote almost seems like a placeholder instead of a proper novel.  It does have a plot, and one that could have been very interesting.  Unfortunately, Baker misses the opportunity and instead provides us with a group of natives who seem much too modern for what they are supposed to be.  Remember, the year is 1700.  Baker has them talking in very modern language which just spoils the mood.  In the Garden of Iden was enhanced by the way Baker had the characters talk the way the English spoke at the time, and it contrasted nicely with the modern English used by the operatives when they weren't interacting with the locals.  This time, though, there is no difference, and it is jarring.  A case could be made that this is a translation of what they said into modern English, but it loses its impact that way.  The tribe just feels out of place.<br />Another problem is the pacing of the book.  Once Joseph has ingratiated himself with the locals, they put on a show for him and the other operatives (masquerading as agents of the Sky Kingdom and the Coyote's helpers).  This show brings the book to a screeching halt for ten pages with a performance that isn't even that funny.  It lacks Baker's characteristic wit and charm and seems superfluous.  Baker may have been trying to illustrate something with this, but it fails miserably.  At 310 pages (small pages with fairly large type and lots of dialogue), the book is already short.  The ten pages taken up by this show make it seem even shorter and really could have been used elsewhere.  It feels like nothing much of consequence happens in the book because of this problem.<br />The mission seems very easy, with only a couple of roadblocks thrown up to add any suspense into whether or not the mission will succeed. To me, this implies that the point of the book is not the mission itself, but what it means to the Company and the operatives.  This is where the book shines, and I wish Baker would have given us more of this and less of the mission.  For the first time, we meet the mortals who created these people, and we are less than impressed.  They are, basically, dweebs.  Afraid of germs, afraid of violence, afraid of any sort of religious ceremonies, they paint a picture of the future that looks horrible.  This is not only to the readers, but to the Company operatives as well.  A number of them are meeting their creators for the first time, and a crisis of conscience springs up.  These immortals have been living for centuries, all of them working toward the goal of reaching a year in the 2300s where the fruits of their labors will finally bear fruit.  But is this what they're waiting for?  Might it not be better if they took over and set the world on the proper course?  This is dangerous thinking, and it provides the heart and soul of the book, along with setting up some wonderful future possibilities for future books.<br />The relationship between Joseph and Mendoza takes a further step as Mendoza walks further and further away from her humanity.  She still blames Joseph for what happened with her lover in England, and she's allowed those events to push her further away from the humanity she once held when Joseph recruited her.  Joseph, meanwhile, has had centuries to learn techniques to keep that humanity vibrant.  The interaction between the two of them is crackling, and you really start to wonder if Mendoza agrees with the potential rebels or not.  While this is Joseph's book, Mendoza is the one who is truly developed.  We never see any of the events from Mendoza's point of view, but that actually adds to her mystique.<br />Thus, I give a guarded recommendation to Sky Coyote.  There are so many interesting events going on, that you can't really miss it.  It's just too bad the native story couldn't be included in that description.  This will probably be a vital link in the series, so it will be worth your time.  Besides, it is short so you won't have that much trouble getting through it.<br />David Roydds to her mystique.<br />Thus, I give a guarded recommendation to Sky Coyote.

Benjamin January and his new wife, Rose, are caught up in Mexican intrigue in Days of the Dead, Barbara Hambly's latest January novel.  In it, Hambly removes January from the familiar confines of 1830s New Orleans to put him in a new environment, though the suspense, mystery, and characterization is the same:  top-notch.  Hambly has done her research and it shows, as she immerses the reader in chaotic Mexico City in 1835, months before General Santa Anna marched on Texas.  The fact that she provides an interesting story that will always keep you guessing is an added benefit.<br />Barbara Hambly has long been one of my favourite authors, and the January series is always a treat.  She's always been a master at creating atmosphere, but New Orleans has always seemed to inspire her to new heights.  This time, she transplants this to Mexico City, but she continues to set the stage well.  Her descriptions are wonderful, placing the reader right into the dirty streets, the majestic countryside or the Aztec pyramids.  Even when she just has two characters walking down the street talking, she sets the mood with the vivid descriptions of the lepers begging for money, the carriages trundling down the street, and the merchants hawking their goods.  If you are not a fan of description and just want the &quot;meat&quot; of the story, then Hambly's books are not for you.  But if you like to be &quot;in the scene&quot; with the characters, you can't beat the January series.<br />That doesn't mean that nothing happens in these books.  Far from it.  The mystery that Hambly presents is intriguing and will definitely have you wondering what's going on.  There is a little bit of action too as the bullets do fly, and the ending is breathtaking in its tension.  Hambly does a wonderful job wrapping the mystery around the setting, making Mexico an integral part of it.  While Hambly has clearly done a lot of research into the time period, she doesn't present it to the reader on a plate, showcasing it.  Instead, everything that she puts in there is for a purpose.  Some of it is to set the scene, but most of it does involve the mystery in some way, including the ways family worked in Mexico at the time.  It truly is seamless and the reader can learn a lot just by reading (she does point out, in notes at the back of the book, a couple of incidents of poetic license she took).<br />All the characters can be a bit confusing at first, but overall she does very well with them. It can be a bit hard to keep all of the family relationships straight in the reader's mind.  One good thing that she does, avoiding a trap that other series writers don't always, is she doesn't force all of her characters into a book.  In Wet Grave, she left Hannibal out.  In Days of the Dead, she doesn't come up with some reason why January's family would get involved in something down in Mexico.  Thus, his sisters and mother, along with Lieutenant Shaw, make no appearance.  While I missed Shaw (my favourite character in the series), I'm glad she didn't force the issue.<br />So we're left with Ben, Rose, and Hannibal, and all three of them are marvelous.  Rose has grown in the previous books from a woman who is very reserved and fearful of men into a self-assured woman who is even able to flirt when necessary to find out information.  Some people may think that's bad characterization, but I think it's a natural growth that her exposure to Benjamin and her ability to finally give in to her love for him has caused.  She's dealt with her demons, and she has moved on, and Hambly has handled her progression wonderfully.  Ben and Hannibal are also very interesting people with weaknesses and faults, but virtues that go beyond them.<br />She handles the guest characters with equal aplomb.  All of them are distinctive in some way, though again there are so many at first that it's hard to keep track.  They aren't cardboard at all, with each one given three dimensions in some way.  Probably the best is the cook, Guillenormand, who is very feisty when it comes to his cooking being questioned, and flies off the handle at even the hint that something in his food may have caused the death.  It's a wonderful scene and he's a wonderful character.<br />I heartily recommend Days of the Dead.  It's not necessary to read any of the previous books, but I do believe you'll get more out of it if you do.  If you like suspense and historical mysteries, give the Benjamin January series a try.  You won't regret it.<br />David Roybest is the cook, Guillenormand, who is very feisty when it comes to his cooking being questioned, and flies off the handle at even the hint that something in his food may have caused the death.

US	50332419	R3CT90KFOOYS6K	034544423X	851987429	American Empire: The Victorious Opposition	Books	2	18	18	N	N	Trudging through alternate history	The echoes of war loom over a divided North American continent in Harry Turtledove's American Empire: The Victorious Opposition, the third book in the middle trilogy of books.  Starting with The Great War saga, Turtledove has told a tale of alternate history, with the Confederacy having won the Civil War and still being around in the early 1900s.  The American Empire trilogy has told the story of the inter-war years, and Turtledove's ideas are fascinating.  Unfortunately, the writing doesn't keep up with it.<br /><br />Harry Turtledove really confuses me sometimes.  I love the concept of this series and I love what he's doing with it.  The idea of a Confederacy taking part in World War I and the rise of a Hitler-like figure in the downtrodden South that sparks World War II is fascinating.  However, the way he writes just annoys me.  His constant repetition (he uses the same metaphors over and over) and his need to introduce his characters every time we see them in the book are just grating.  We know that Abner Dowling served under Custer during the First World War and that Dowling didn't like him.  Even if we hadn't read the previous books, we got that the first time Turtledove introduces Dowling in this book.  We don't need to get it again the next time, and the time after that.  It's like Turtledove thinks that his readers don't have the attention span to keep all of his characters straight.  While that may be a valid point (previous books have had a lot of viewpoint characters), Turtledove has actually toned that down in this one, having only a few characters act as main ones.  Others are introduced as some of the previous ones die off, keeping the cast to a manageable level.<br /><br />This brings up another point as well.  Turtledove is not afraid to kill off some of his characters, so it's nice that you don't quite know who's going to survive and who's going to live.  However, some of the characters' fates are so obvious that it felt really boring, just waiting for the inevitable end to the storyline.  Some of these characters we have been following for six books now, so it seemed a shame that their deaths were so telegraphed.  Even when they weren't telegraphed, they seemed very perfunctory.  Two of the characters just die off with no real ending to their ongoing story, which bristled.  We've been waiting six books for the payoff to their story, expecting some sort of comeuppance or resolution, but nothing happens.  The character just dies and that's it.  End of story.  I was not amused.  Turtledove also spends time developing his next set of characters who will carry the next series, with the sons and daughters of our well-known characters finally getting their time on stage so we can get to know them.<br /><br />Another fault with the book is one I had with the Blood & Iron as well.  Too much of the history is a pale imitation of what really occurred in history.  Some of it is unavoidable.  The blacks in the Confederacy are the Jews from our real history (brought to life in a very chilling scene late in the book).  The United States is Britain as it led up to the war (though at least Turtledove avoids having the President make a speech about \\"peace in our time\\").  However, Turtledove doesn't make it different enough to be as interesting.  Kentucky, a state that the USA has controlled since the war, is the Rhineland, even down to the Confederacy moving in troops when they promised to keep it demilitarized for twenty-five years.  While all the events in the book inevitably led to the conclusion we all know about (World War II), the events themselves should have been at least slightly different.  That's what made  The Center Cannot Hold more interesting.  Different events occurred, surprising the reader even as we know where it will ultimately lead.<br /><br />With all of this wrong with the book, how were the characters?  Just like other Turtledove books, they were hit or miss.  Some of them are interesting (Chester Martin and his attempt to unionize the construction industry in California really has me wondering where Turtledove is going with this one, which is a good thing), while others are bland and boring (Nellie Jacobs has to be one of the most worthless characters I've ever read about).  Others are intriguing just because of who they represent in real history (Featherston, Clarence Potter).  Overall, Turtledove does a passable job.<br /><br />One good thing about the book, however, is the mood.  As the book reaches its conclusion and war looms on the horizon, there's a palpable sense of fear and resignation that, because of Featherston, war is unavoidable.  The United States has finally drawn a line that he can't cross, and when he does (just like in real life), the inevitable conflagration occurs, leading us into the next series. The tension is very well done, making the ending much better than the rest of the book.<br /><br />The Victorious Opposition is a triumph of concept over prose, and I think that's why I can't read any other series by Turtledove.  The concept of this entire series has kept me hooked for six books, when other, better-written books have turned me off and forced me to give them up.  If you are a fan of alternate history and can get past the wretched prose and obvious characters, then give this book a try.  If you are not in that select group of people, then give it a miss.<br /><br />David Royze the construction industry in California really has me wondering where Turtledove is going with this one, which is a good thing), while others are bland and boring (Nellie Jacobs has to be one of the most worthless characters I've ever read about).

As the book reaches its conclusion and war looms on the horizon, there's a palpable sense of fear and resignation that, because of Featherston, war is unavoidable.  The United States has finally drawn a line that he can't cross, and when he does (just like in real life), the inevitable conflagration occurs, leading us into the next series. The tension is very well done, making the ending much better than the rest of the book.      The Victorious Opposition is a triumph of concept over prose, and I think that's why I can't read any other series by Turtledove.  The concept of this entire series has kept me hooked for six books, when other, better-written books have turned me off and forced me to give them up.  If you are a fan of alternate history and can get past the wretched prose and obvious characters, then give this book a try.  If you are not in that select group of people, then give it a miss.

High Druid of Shannara: Jarka Ruus is the beginning of yet another three-book series set in this world.  After the lackluster Voyage of the Jerle Shannara series (Ilse Witch, Antrax, and Morgawr), I had hoped Brooks wouldn't visit Shannara again for awhile, as that series was very similar to all of his other books and didn't offer very much new.  I'm very pleased to say, however, that while it's not the most original book around, Jarka Ruus is actually a very entertaining book to read.<br />While Brooks hasn't knocked one out of the park with this entry, he has certainly stabilized the Shannara franchise after the free-fall that was Jerle Shannara.  The characters are interesting in this one, with Grianne's redemption and the temptation of her old life actually making her a fascinating character.  She knows she must never go back to the person she was, but it makes dealing with the plots against her very difficult.  Her first instinct is to blast back.  Her determination to better herself and to continue on in the face of such diversity is really nice to see.  In addition, it makes her a different character than most of Brooks' other ones, which is refreshing.<br />The other main characters, Pen, Tagwen, Ahren, and Khyber (Ahren's niece) are also nicely done, though less distinctive.  Pen is an Ohmsford, and he isn't much different from the Ohmsford heroes of old from all of the previous books.  He has his own little piece of magic (though the magic itself seems to be dying out as it's diluted along the Ohmsford bloodline) that is seemingly useless but becomes appropriate for the mission at hand.  That does seem a little convenient and arbitrary, one of the faults with the premise of the series.  He's young and impetuous, easily falling in love with the daughter of the airship captain they hire to take them on their journey.  The others have some nice characterization as well, though they do not stand out<br />The saving grace of this novel is the world and the fact that Brooks seems to be trying something a little different.  Redemption has never been one of his main themes, but this time he tackles it with full force.  Grianne is put in a situation that will require her to make choices between her old self and the new, and the consequences of those choices could mean her life.  There is a parallel between this series and Jerle, in the fact that another male relative of Grianne's has to save her.  However, Jarka Ruus shows us that Grianne is more than capable of taking care of herself while she's waiting to be rescued.  This is clearly her story even as it's Pen's coming of age.  Brooks handles the two plot lines with effortless ease, never letting us grow tired of one before switching back to the other one.<br />Another strength of the book is the use of Shannara continuity.  I've always loved this world, even as I've disliked some of the books, and Brooks takes us on another travelogue around it.  He uses just the right combination of old and new to season the book without overpowering it.  There are references to almost every previous book, but either they are just for the fans and aren't really necessary, or he explains them well enough that the new reader will not be confused.  Brooks has been known to wallow in this stuff, so seeing the light but firm touch he has on continuity in this book was great.  We even get to see places that have been referred to but never actually seen (the Forbidding, where demons have been locked away for millennia, and the far northern areas of the world).<br />Only a couple of things bring the book down, though.  First, Brooks continues to have his characters brood as a way of thinking about the things happening to them.  There are times when this goes on for a page or two, with the character just thinking about their situation, how they got there, and what they should do next.  At least they didn't do this in the middle of combat, which was one of my criticisms of earlier books. It still got monotonous, though.<br />Secondly, there is a bit of an internal logic problem that gnawed at me.  During the run from the other druid airship, much is made of the fact that Ahren cannot use his druid magic or else the bad guys would be able to trace them.  They are constantly talking about this.  Then, once when he is forced to use his magic, they don't seem to express any worry about it.  They settle down in a city waiting for the storm to abate so they can cast off again.  They are then surprised by the druid ship.  Shouldn't they have been expecting and worrying about this?  However they should have reacted, it should not have been with surprise.<br />Jarka Ruus is a very promising first entry in the High Druid of Shannara series.  I hope that Brooks can maintain this quality, or even exceed it.  He does seem to have a winning formula, but this time he's not trying to sell us more of the same in a different package.  It's familiar enough for regular Brooks readers, but not so familiar that you feel you just shelled out more money for the same book.<br />David Royn the middle of combat, which was one of my criticisms of earlier books.

Joe Queenan has written the ultimate sports fan book.  True Believers is dedicated to the real sports fan.  Not fans of the Los Angeles Lakers or the New York Yankees, but the fans of downtrodden teams like the Phillies, the Blackhawks, and the Eagles.  Fans who know what it's like to suffer through years of torment, wondering if your team was ever going to be good enough to win it all.  Queenan grew up in Philadelphia, and he has a life-long commitment to all of his hometown teams.  He says that fan support must be based either on where you grew up, or who your father rooted for.  No other form of fandom is acceptable to him.  Thus, he has had to live through the Phillies blowing a 6.5 game lead with 12 games to go in 1964, the Flyers blowing a 3-1 lead in the playoffs to the New Jersey Devils (with two of the last three games at home), and other heartbreaks.  Loving Philadelphia teams is the epitome of heartbreak, the ultimate love-hate relationship.<br />Why should this matter to the rest of us?  I will tell you right now that, if you have never followed any sports and think that to do so is the ultimate waste of time, then this book is not for you.  First, you will not understand it.  Secondly, what little you do understand will only reinforce your already formed beliefs.  Unless you have experienced the common bond of watching your team blow the big game, or the big series, or just stink up the league in general, you will not get a lot out of this book.  (Ok, maybe if you're a Yankee fan, you'll be able to laugh at these idiots he's talking about).<br />What does this book consist of?  Queenan discusses the psychology behind rooting for a team of also-rans.  He explores what makes the true sports fan tick.  He does this among chapters discussing fair weather fans (those fans who only follow a team when they are good), sports movies (and how most of them are horrible and don't even come close to reflecting reality), sports announcers (both the good and the bad), and misbehaving fans (those idiots in the stands who do the stupidest things and generally annoy the people around them).  Some of these chapters are universal, even to Yankees fans, and thus may be enjoyed by everybody.  Some (like an entire chapter on the sorry-looking New York Jets) will only mean something to the fan who has been through something similar.  All of these chapters, however, share Queenan's sarcastic wit and his extreme commentary.  I love the language that Queenan uses and the way he writes, even if sometimes it seems he's using words just to see whether people understand them or not.  At times he sounds pompous, but even then he's entertaining.<br />The fair-weather fan chapter is probably the best, as he itemizes all the different types of front-runners there are, from celebrities who must be seen at courtside of Lakers games, to the mainstream folk who just can't bear to suffer along with the true fan, and thus change their favourite team on the drop of a quarter.  As he says, suffering is what makes success taste so sweet.  If you haven't been through the dark times, then when they finally do win a championship, you can't truly appreciate it.  He loathes front-runners with a passion, and he's not afraid to say it.  He certainly takes no prisoners in this chapter, heaping scorn on every type of front-runner there is.<br />If there is any fault in the book, it is the fact that some of the references are very obscure (though as Queenan would say, if you don't know it, you're probably not a true fan).  I love sports and follow a lot of them, but some of the references are so old that even I didn't get them.  You could figure them out from the context, but I think some of the humour value is lost there.  Sometimes he explains them, or at least gives a year that it happened, but other times he goes on like we should be able to keep up with him.  I had no trouble skipping the reference, assuming that it was supposed to illustrate some point, and moving on.  However, it is a strike against the book.  One other thing I would like to know is what he thinks of fans like me.  I grew up in Iowa, where there are no professional sports teams, and my father was not a huge fan of anything either.  I have my allegiances that have never died since childhood, but they certainly don't seem to fit his criteria.  What does that make me?  Unfortunately, Queenan doesn't address that, so it feels like something's missing.<br />Even so, this book is definitely a winner.  At times it's hilarious, at times it's touching (like when he talks about when his father's last days and how they affected Queenan's spectatorship).  You may see yourself reflected in it.  You may just find other fans to ridicule.  Maybe you're not a sports fan but you're trying to understand a husband (or wife???) who is.  If so, get this book.  You will either laugh at or along with Queenan as he continues his odyssey.  And you might even learn something along the way.  Yes, even you Yankees fans.<br />David Royving on.

First of all, Monstrous Regiment is the 28th Discworld book, and Pratchett is just getting started.  Every time you think he has run out of ideas, he comes up with something new (or an interesting take on something old).  This book is no different, as this time he examines the military and the military mindset.  Is it a good one?  SIR, YES SIR!<br />This is another winning Discworld book.  It's a bit different in tone from Night Watch, if only because the humour is broader.  In Night Watch, the humour was on the side and it was a fairly serious book except for that.  This has a serious point to make as well, but the humour involves everybody.  It was refreshing to see.  Pratchett has some good points to make on military matters in the real world, and he skewers the entire mindset (not necessarily of the men, who he never really disparages, but the planners).<br />He does have the obvious stereotypes of the hard drill sergeant and the lieutenant who doesn't really know what he's doing and has no experience.  But even these stereotypes he turns on their heads, shakes them upside down, and looks at what comes out.  Pratchett, always a master of character, has created some new winners (though I don't believe they'll be back in another book, like some of Pratchett's recurring characters).  Polly is the typical Pratchett hero:  determined, relatively straight-laced, intelligent and resourceful.  She's a wonderful viewpoint character, scared but determined to do what is right.  When she's assigned to be the lieutenant's assistant, she's reluctant to take advantage of the position, though she does so to help out her mates.  She helps Lieutenant Blouse along, though she's terrified of shaving him because she's never learned how to shave herself.<br />Probably the best character in the book, though, is Jackrum.  He reminds me a lot of Sam Vimes from the City Watch books, but with a different edge to him.  He's a soldier and nothing else.  He doesn't want to be an officer. He doesn't want to be a civilian.  He wants to do his job, keep his lads safe, and bring them home.  He doesn't like sneaking around and doing things different from the army way, and he's horrified when Blouse wants to use subterfuge to get into the castle they're supposed to take.  He's a man of duty, honour, and integrity, and while he's always rough on his men, he also respects them.  Of course, we find out there's a reason behind the man he is, which is what really cuts him apart from Vimes.<br />The other characters are standout even if they aren't developed that much.  There's the religious zealot who constantly speaks to \\"The Duchess,\\" (the figure who, much like Queen Victoria, hasn't been seen much since her husband died, and who many feel is actually dead).  There are a couple of fire-bugs who ran away from where they were being held.  The best of this bunch, however, is the vampire (Maladict) and the latest in a long string of Igors in a Discworld book.  Maladict has sworn off blood in order to be accepted in society, and has developed an addiction to coffee instead.  He's the only one that seems, at least initially, to know what's going on.  When the coffee runs out, look out!  Igor is much the same as most of his brethren, handy with a surgical knife and internal organs.  Both of these characters add some sparkle when they're on the page, as well as a lot of laughs.<br />There are a few well-known Discworld characters in the book to add colour as well.  William de Worde (the journalist from The Truth) and his photographer vampire Otto, make an appearance.  I'm surprised that they weren't \\"embedded\\" with the troops, but that may have been a bit obvious.  Pratchett does use them to make some statements about the Press in wartime, and how wars are reported.  Samuel Vimes and a couple of his watchmen are also included, though they don't have a major part.  I think Vimes is included mainly as a counterpoint for Jackrum's character, and he does a good job of that.  He's also a voice of reason in a sea of insanity (Polly's adrift in that sea, so she doesn't count).<br />The best thing about Pratchett is that he is entertaining and thought-provoking even when you might not agree with him.  Given some of the things he makes light of, I may be able to guess what his opinion is on the recent war in Iraq.  However, even if you don't agree with him, he will make you think.  And he will make you laugh, which is the most important part.  He also touches on gender and religious issues, all in one book.  The fact that he's able to make interesting points without seeming like a scattershot approach says something about Pratchett's writing.<br />Monstrous Regiment is a return of sorts to Pratchett's previous style of combining humour and social commentary.  It's another must-read for any Pratchett fan.<br />David Roythat.

US	50332419	R7TNSZSVPF0UT	0613292650	328763020	In the Garden of Iden	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Blood Mary and the romantic problems she causes	In the Garden of Iden is Kage Baker's debut novel of &quot;The Company.&quot;  It's a science fiction novel set in the 1550s, during the reign in Britain of Queen Mary.  Baker's fluid style is a joy to read and her transformation from &quot;modern&quot; English to Renaissance and back to modern is wonderful.  This is a marvelous debut and I can't wait to read more in the series.<br />I've loved Kage Baker's work ever since I read her stories in the various Year's Best Fantasy books, and I was eager to dive into a novel written by her.  It was definitely worth the wait.  Her prose style is wonderful and she seamlessly changes dialogue depending on who's talking, thus giving us the dialect of the time alongside the modern phrasings of a group of cyborgs honed by time travelers.  I'm not expert enough to tell whether or not she gets the Renaissance dialogue right, but she certainly makes it feel right.  It really makes you feel like you are there listening.<br />Another thing Baker avoids, for the most part, is making the romance cloying.  While there were a few times where Mendoza and Nicholas became annoyingly written, most of the time this was turned on its head by a choice comment from Joseph (the leader of the expedition and Mendoza's recruiter) or something else happening.  She doesn't overwrite the romance scenes and she deftly &quot;fades to black&quot; when the sex scenes are about to start.  Thus, while the novel definitely has some adult themes, there are no actual scenes that should keep kids away from the book.  Instead, she writes two adults who love each other deeply but know that there are some serious potential problems that might get in the way of that love.<br />The concept of the Company is very interesting.  Time travel and cyborg technology have been invented, so what they do is send operatives back in time to recruit local people, train them in secret facilities (bringing them up to modern standards), turn them into immortal cyborgs, and allow them to do the job of preserving things.  They take samples of various things that will become extinct, hide them away for a thousand years, and then &quot;discover&quot; them again in the present.  One of Baker's most inspired creations is a radio that broadcasts at a frequency that humans can't hear, and which operatives can listen to and find out what is going on locally.  Thus, there is a news story about the reintroduction of Papal law in the British parliament, along with commentary similar to a CNN broadcast.  It was very innovative.<br />Baker also does a credible job with the characters.  All of the operatives (there are four) in the house are interestingly written and have some sort of way to keep them straight.  Nefer is stuck in limbo while she's waiting for an assignment in northern England, and she's also the resident animal expert.  Thus, she has an affinity for them and takes umbrage at what she sees as the torturing of a goat (the owner tried to graft a horn on its forehead and called it a unicorn).  Joseph has the worn feel of a man who's been around for hundreds of years and has seen it all, but yet he knows exactly how it feels to be a first-time operative.  He's incredibly understanding with Mendoza, forgiving her the jitters and mistakes that any rookie will have.  He is a wonderful mentor to her as well.  I didn't feel like I knew Flavius very well, but he's not in the book much so there isn't a reason to flesh him out further than he already is.  The local characters have their character hooks and are recognizably different, but aren't anything special.<br />The romance would not work if Nicholas is badly done, so it's a good thing that Baker saved her best for him.  He is well-rounded with intelligence and wit, and the verbal sparring between Mendoza and him is great.  His beliefs are very strong, and he sticks to them through everything.  Watching Mendoza try desperately to convince him to run away from the inquisition that is coming to England is almost heartbreaking.  With the exception of a few times, the book sparkles when the two of them are on the page, and he is a worthy companion for Mendoza.  When things start to go sour, it's on an understandable basis and Nicholas reacts as he should.<br />The plot is a bit slow-moving, but it is interestingly told.  There are a few places it drags as Baker takes a detour to do a little philosophizing.  The trigger event for the climax also feels a bit artificial as Joseph makes a mistake that I didn't really think he would make with his experience in the field.  Then again, these people are human so mistakes do happen to the best of them.  It just felt a little bit too much like it was there just so that the plot could start moving.<br />Baker has created a wonderful little sci-fi story and if she can continue to write this strongly, she will continue for a very long time.  The fact that there are already 3 other books, along with a short story collection, bodes well for the success of the series.  If you want something new to try, this would be a good one to start with.  Even if you don't like science fiction, you might find something in here to enjoy.<br />David Royand is almost heartbreaking.

US	50332419	R3NFZ3SXBE2ZU9	0061020397	545755908	Carpe Jugulum (Discworld)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	What a bloody nuisance	Carpe Jugulum, the 23rd Discworld novel by the ever-amusing Terry Pratchett, introduces vampires to the Disc.  Having read the books out of order, and having already read all of the subsequent ones, vampires are old-hat to me.  A couple of times, I had to consciously remember that this was the first and that some of the things I knew about them weren't true in this one.  That being said, this is another wonderful Discworld book, a notch on his belt that looks rather toothy.<br />A number of people have commented on the similarities between this book and Lords &amp; Ladies, with the vampires replacing the elves as villains.  While I do see some similarities, there are some marked differences as well.  Carpe Jugulum, I feel, stands well on its own two feet.  There is a completely different purpose behind what the vampires are doing.  The Count wants to modernize his people, to get them to overcome some of the &quot;silly&quot; stereotypes about vampires.  He doesn't want a dank, gloomy castle with webs all over the place.  He doesn't see the hunt as a game where the vampire always loses.  He wants to take over in order to protect himself, his family, and his very way of life.  If he didn't commit some thoroughly evil deeds in the process, his goal might actually be a legitimate one.<br />However, he does commit these acts, and thus must be stopped.  This is where the book does become a little standard, with an intractable enemy facing the witches and Granny using her &quot;headology&quot; to save the day.  I have to admit that what she decides to do is very interesting, and a nice twist on vampire myths in general.  I won't reveal what she does, but suffice it to say that she turns one of the typical vampire powers back on itself in a very novel way.  The plot is well-told by Pratchett, and for once the ending doesn't actually come out of left field.  If you read the characters properly (especially Igor, who is also introduced in this book), then you may be able to guess what happens.<br />As for the characters, Pratchett again excels.  The witches are their normal selves (Magrat is kind of shy but shields a strong backbone when push comes to shove, Nanny Ogg is lewd and crude but always knowledgeable, and Granny is her usual gruff self with a heart underneath which nobody will ever see unless they really look), but the new witch Agnes is also very interesting.  She has a second side to herself which occasionally comes out.  It is a separate personality, which is invaluable in protecting her from the vampire charms.  Mightily Oats is also a hoot, but deep enough that you do start to care about him.  His crisis of faith isn't exactly unique, but Pratchett gives him enough differences to avoid making him unoriginal.<br />The vampires steal the show, though, along with Igor.  We have the Count, who is determined to change things.  His wife, the Countessa, is going along with him but doesn't really believe in it.  The kids, Lacrimosa and Vlad, don't see any point to all this.  They just want to feed and play with the mortals.  These four argue constantly, as the Count flashes them holy signs to harden them against the effects, makes them stay up during the day, and overall annoys them with his optimism that all of these things can be changed.  He's also looking forward to matching wits with Granny, and there are a couple of times where you think that maybe Granny won't succeed.  Igor, however, is the best character in the book.  The vampires are sure that his lisp and the way he walks is all part of the &quot;game&quot; and that he doesn't need to do all of that.  But Igor is a traditionalist, constantly referring to how the old &quot;mathter&quot; used to do things.  &quot;The old mathter loved my spider webs.&quot;  He's a fun character, and I completely understand why Pratchett has used an Igor in almost every book since this one.  He truly is a wonderful creation.<br />The humour is Pratchett at his best, with some innuendo (though kids have either already heard it or wont' get it).  The Witches books always seem to contain things like that, and as before, the plot is much more straightforward then is usual in a Discworld book.  He seems to like using the &quot;traditional&quot; villains whenever they are involved, perhaps because they are the most &quot;normal&quot; heroes he has created.  Sometimes there are some seemingly unnecessary bits, such as the little blue people (Nac mac Feegle) who help King Verence attack the vampires.  However, they are hilarious, so I'll forgive the fact that they don't really do a lot in the book.  The puns are atrocious (the name of the vampires' castle is &quot;Don'tgonearthe Castle&quot;) but I couldn't stop laughing.<br />If you like Pratchett but don't like the Witches, then this book won't change your mind.  But if you haven't tried them yet, give this one a try.  You don't need to have read the previous witches books (though it does help).  And if you're reading this after reading the next few books, keep in mind that some things you know about vampires just aren't true...yet.  What a bloody treat!<br />David Royhough kids have either already heard it or wont' get it).

The puns are atrocious (the name of the vampires' castle is &quot;Don'tgonearthe Castle&quot;) but I couldn't stop laughing.<br />If you like Pratchett but don't like the Witches, then this book won't change your mind.  But if you haven't tried them yet, give this one a try.  You don't need to have read the previous witches books (though it does help).  And if you're reading this after reading the next few books, keep in mind that some things you know about vampires just aren't true...yet.  What a bloody treat!<br />David Roy	2003-09-23

It's set in the same world as Hobbs' Assassin books and her Liveship Trader books, and does even more to tie the two series together, sometimes to its detriment.  While it's not necessarily a bad book, it failed to hold my interest for long periods of time, which is very unusual for a Robin Hobb book.<br />When I read the first book, Fool's Errand, I thought Hobb spent too much of the beginning going over old history in lecture-fashion, basically telling us what happened in the intervening fifteen years by one character telling another what happened.  It was long and boring, but once the book got moving, I couldn't put it down.  This book suffers from similar problems, but it never really recovers from them.  It is packed full of character development and not a lot else.  The book moves at a glacial pace, and when you get to the end of it, you'll discover that not much happened.  There has been some progress in Fitz's attempt to form a group of Skill users to help the Prince, the kidnappers are eventually dealt with, and the Prince and his entourage begin a quest that will take them through the third book.<br />A large portion of the book is taken up with events from the Liveship Trader series of books, and the war between Bingtown and Chalced from those books.  A delegation from Bingtown arrives to try and get the Queen to join their side, and there is much discussion of the different natures of dragons in this world (there appeared to be some incompatibility between the dragons in the original Farseer books and the Liveship Traders books...these incompatibilities are explained).  Thus, there is much exposition explaining what happened in that series, ostensibly because only rumours and weird accounts have reached the ears of the Six Duchies.  Again, this slows the book to a crawl, and I didn't see a lot of benefit to it, as the Bingtown people eventually disappear without much being done with them.  It seems like such a waste, though I suppose this may be a setup for the next book.<br />The other problem with the book is that it's very depressing, as Fitz has nothing but relationship problems in the book.  The relationship between him and The Fool (his best friend and a strange man who is more than he seems) takes a really sour turn.  We do learn a lot about the Fool, but it comes at the expense of their relationship.  Then there is his relationship with his foster son, Hap, and the trials and tribulations that come with that.  There is Jinna, a hedge witch who he sleeps with but doesn't love, and thus feels awful about it.  He and Chade argue quite often, even as Chade pushes him to not only teach the Prince the Skill, but himself as well.  At times, the book seems to be nothing but arguments, and while many of them are dealt with eventually, they're tedious to read through.<br />The characters themselves are ok, but I don't like what was done with them.  I've already detailed Fitz's problems, but there are others as well.  The Fool, my favourite character in the previous book, doesn't do a whole lot in this one.  He sulks a lot, helps Fitz out occasionally before their relationship goes sour, and is generally boring otherwise.  I never thought I'd say that about this character.  His connection to the Liveship Trader series is revealed, but never really explained.  I would have appreciated either one or the other: either explain most of it, or don't reveal it.  Instead, it's the worst of both worlds as we know the truth but we have no idea why it is the truth.<br />Fitz is a spy as well as an assassin, and he spends a lot of time observing things from secret tunnels.  Thus, Hobb gets around the limitation of first person storytelling: you can only reveal the narrator's point of view.  There are times where this doesn't feel natural, like it's only there so Hobb can tell us something is happening.  He also spends a lot of time recovering from the only real action in the novel, and this tends to drag as well, again exposing another weakness of first-person: when the main character gets boring, you can't move on to somebody else.<br />It took me a couple of weeks to read this book, where the first one just took a few days.  I never had the feeling that I couldn't put it down, or that I must pick it up and read more to see what's happening.  I love the characters in this series, and I feel a lot of loyalty to them.  I think that's the only reason I kept going.  There is also a lot of potential, and the book ends with the beginning of an interesting-sounding quest.  This one has the same feel that many other &quot;second books&quot; have, which is as a placeholder.  Hopefully Hobb will rebound with the third and final book.the novel, and this tends to drag as well, again exposing another weakness of first-person: when the main character gets boring, you can't move on to somebody else.  <br />It took me a couple of weeks to read this book, where the first one just took a few days.

Hartwell.  This year's version, volume 3, has even more goodness than last year's version did.  Twenty-nine stories in all, ranging from short 3-page stories to 40 page ones, by some of the biggest names in the field.  This is the perfect sampler to see what's going on in the Fantasy world, to see who the up-and-comers are, and get a taste of what they're offering.  On the strength of some of the stories in this volume, I'm definitely going to check out a couple that I've never tried before.<br />I'd say that this volume is better than last year's edition, just because there weren't any stories that I didn't like.  There were some that were weaker than others, of course, but no real clunkers in the bunch.  It has fantasy for every taste, from urban fantasy to other worlds, if you've got a taste for the stuff, this book will satiate it.  I will, of course, include a list of the stories at the end of the review so you can check them out and see if there are any authors that you particularly like.<br />I love the short fiction format, especially when it's done well.  There are some standout entries in this year's edition, capped off with a short little piece by Michael Swanwick called \\"Five British Dinosaurs.\\"  This one is extremely short, but a lot is carried in a small package.  It's about the discovery of dinosaur bones in Great Britain in the 19th century, along with the discovery that there are some living specimens hanging around in the British aristocracy.  This story is hilarious and I found myself laughing throughout it's brief span.  The thought of a walking dinosaur speaking in proper British English, disputing the reconstruction of the bones of his ancestors, is priceless.  Swanwick gives the dinosaurs a lot of personality, along with a lot of arrogance.  \\"Things were definitely better run in the Mesozoic?But mammals knew their place then.\\"  Swanwick has the honour of being the only person with two stories included, but they are both very short and so I figure Hartwell decided that he could afford the space.<br />Another standout is Steve Popkes and his story, \\" A Fable of Saviour & Reptile.\\"  This is a re-telling of the Jesus story, from the point of view of a talking turtle that befriends Jesus when he's young.  The turtle is suitably haughty, given his long life span and his infinite patience (given the fact that it takes him a long time to get anywhere).  It's an interesting take on the whole Messiah story, but if you can get past the irreligious tone of the story, it is very heartwarming.  Hartwell warns in his prologue to it \\"Do note the word 'fable' in the title.\\"  While it gives an alternate view of Jesus and his life (including filling in the missing thirty or so years that the Bible doesn't include), it is very respectful the idea behind the story.  The turtle is characterized wonderfully, and Jesus is too if you can get past the fact that he does drink when he's younger (getting a little drunk with the turtle) and he has a wife and son.  It's a story about the power of myth and how humans can attach meaning to anything if it will help them get through life and possibly throw off the yoke of oppression.  There are some very touching moments and conversations between the two of them, especially when the turtle comforts Jesus in his cell right before he's crucified.  This is probably the best story in the book, and I am definitely going to track down some more by this guy.<br />Other particularly good stories are Kage Baker's \\"Her Father's Eyes\\" (a tale of a young girl and the boy she meets and befriends on a plane), Neil Gaiman's \\"October in the Chair\\" (a typical Gaiman tale about stories and the people who tell them, this time a group of god-like beings), and \\"A Prayer for Captain LaHire\\" by Patrice E. Sarath (a story of three knights who followed Joan of Arc until she burned, and the horror that they discover a fourth disciple has unleashed).  Finally, there is P.D. Cacek's \\"A Book, by its Cover.\\"  This is a wonderful little tale about a Jewish boy in the aftermath of Kristallnacht in Berlin, and the bookshop owner who he believes is doing evil things afterward.  It's has a wonderful message about books and the effects that they can have on a person.<br />If there are any weaknesses in the book, they are purely my personal feeling.  I'm not a big fan of Tanith Lee, though I know that she is very popular.  Thus, her story \\"Persian Eyes\\" didn't do a whole lot for me.  In it, a Roman noble family is destroyed by the work of a slave girl and her magic eyes.  It was more interesting to me than her entry in last year's book, but not by much.  Also, \\"The Pagodas of Ciboure\\" just dragged on a little too long for my tastes.  In it, a sick boy is healed by some French fairy creatures called \\"pagodas,\\" though he has to save them from an onslaught of slugs first.  It's cute, and it's well-told, but it's just too long.<br />That being said, I did enjoy even those stories.  This is just a top-notch collection of short fantasy.  Hartwell has done it again, pulling together a varied group of stories that can't help but satisfy.  If you're a fantasy fan and like the short fiction genre, this is definitely the book for you.  Hartwell has another winner, and I can't wait for next year's edition.<br />David Royle has unleashed).  Finally, there is P.D.

They all state how funny he is, except for the CNN blurb.  Bill Maher says it's \\"a treat to have his insanity in book form.\\"  This is a book about conspiracies and Belzer himself says in his introduction that he's trying to get the reader to ask questions and not accept the government's word on everything.  If he's trying to do that, is it a good thing that he's called \\"insane\\" in a recommendation blurb?  I don't think so.<br />When I first picked this book up at the library (I'm a big fan of Belzer from his television roles), the subject matter intrigued me just enough that I wanted to see what Belzer had to say on it.  I saw the three things mentioned in the title, but I thought the book would move beyond those three items and delve into other conspiracy theories as well.  No luck, though.  The entire first half of the book talks about the JFK assassination, and all of the theories behind it.  The second half is about aliens and other space-based \\"cover-ups.\\"  He only mentions Elvis in passing.  I was very disappointed.<br />That was actually my reaction to the entire book:  disappointment.  I had so many problems with this book, but they boil down to two.  First, the way the book is formatted and written, I had doubts on Belzer's credibility.  This doesn't even involve cover blurbs.  The JFK section of the book seems like nothing more than a rehash of the many theories that are already out there.  Granted, it's nice to have them all in one place, but it would have been nice to get something new in there as well.  Belzer talks about all of the different theories, but never really comes down on any one side.  Was it the mafia?  The CIA?  Lyndon Johnson?  The Communists?  All of them combined?  He probably thought that saying so many theories are possible is a good way to get people to question.  It doesn't have that effect on me, however.  Instead, I felt like I had been hit with a shotgun, with all of these pellets of theory hitting me in the head and none of them actually registering as a shot.<br />Starting with JFK is the easy part.  Even many people who think conspiracy-minded people are nuts think that something's fishy about the whole JFK thing.  It's like throwing a rock at the ocean:  you can't miss.  Belzer spends over half the book on it, and I kept saying \\"yeah, fine, this is definitely a conspiracy...do you have anything interesting?\\"<br />When Belzer finally does move on, he moves to the various UFO stories:  alien abductions, sightings, close encounters, that sort of thing.  He further damages his credibility, though, by bringing up the moon landing \\"hoax.\\"  Ok, he says in the introduction that this may be \\"a little over the top\\" but then he goes on to say that he wouldn't put it past the government to try and do something like that.  Later, when he actually addresses it, he gives all the standard reasons for it being a hoax (no stars in pictures, moon dust, shadows, etc) which have been thoroughly debunked (check the web by putting \\"moon hoax\\" in the search engine).  This does not help his credibility any.  He quickly backs away from it and talks about people who believe that the beings inhabiting the moon and using it as a base kicked us off of it.  Which is it Richard?  The fact that he seems to believe a theory that's been completely discredited (though some people still cling to it) just takes away from the credibility of the rest of the text.<br />The second problem is Belzer's writing style.  I love Belzer's trademark wit, and he definitely applies it in this book.  The trouble was, as I ground through the text, I found his asides and witticisms increasingly grating.  That could be because I wasn't liking what I was reading, so maybe it's tied to my first problem.  Whatever the case, I found his style cringe-worthy and it's only the fact that it's a short book that let me get through itwithout throwing it against the wall.<br />Tied into the style is the format of the book.  Theories are tossed in and then ignored with alarming regularity.  Belzer brings up the supposed connection between Kennedy and Lincoln, even going so far as to imply that the John Wilkes Booth who was killed after Lincoln was shot wasn't the real assassin, but a patsy.  What's the scoop behind that?  I couldn't tell you, because Belzer drops it and goes back to JFK.  The book is also filled with sidebars, which also makes it a bit annoying.  You constantly have to leave the ongoing text to read the little side note or factoid that's also on the page.  Other times, the sidebar has more space on the page then the regular text. I think this did add to the quickness of the reading, because there isn't as much as text to read as you would have thought.<br />Overall, I couldn't find much to like about this book.  It would be a good introduction to the various theories that are out there having to do with certain conspiracies.  The UFO conspiracies are actually kind of interesting, though again the credibility gap is there.  Since this is Belzer's stated goal, I guess the best question is:  does it make you ask questions?  My personal answer is no.  To me, you would have to already be leaning that way before this book would push you over the edge.  Does the government lie to us?  Inevitably.  But I don't necessarily buy the specific lies that Belzer is selling.  Most importantly for a book review, I also didn't enjoy the sell-job.<br />David Royt without throwing it against the wall.<br />Tied into the style is the format of the book.

US	50332419	RMW7WI1XXWEOO	0765304686	952123131	Mistress of Dragons (The Dragonvarld, Book 1)	Books	5	9	12	N	N	Scaly mistress	Margaret Weis became prominent with the original Dragonlance Chronicles many years ago.  In fact, her name became so synonymous with dragons that I was always surprised when a series came out that didn't have them in it.  She had moved away from that distinction until she and her writing partner Tracey Hickman came back to the Dragonlance saga.  Now, it appears that she has given in to destiny and embraced dragons.<br /><br />Weis' latest book, Mistress of Dragons, is the start of a new solo trilogy for her, and it contains many familiar elements to any fan of her books, namely dragons.  Aside from that, though, the characterization and plot felt very comfortable for me, a fan of her previous work who hasn't read one of her books in a long while.  \\"Familiar,\\" in this case, isn't a bad thing.  She's not re-writing the same plot over and over again.  Instead, she breaks new ground, but with the style and panache that I remember from before.  I really enjoyed Mistress of Dragons, and am anxiously awaiting the sequel.<br /><br />For an \\"epic\\" fantasy, this is a surprisingly small book as far as characters go.  There are only four main ones, with some secondary characters floating about.  This makes Mistress of Dragons a very tight book, and I found that it flowed very nicely because of this.  Draconas is the dragon-in-human-form who must figure out the plot while trying to stay on the right side of dragon law by not revealing himself to the humans.  There is Melisande, the high priestess of the sisterhood and the woman designated to be the next Mistress when the old, current one dies.  Bellona is the captain of the guard at the monastery and Melisande's lover and confidante.  Finally, there's Edward, king of Idlyswylde and a man who just wants to do the right thing and protect his kingdom from a dragon.  Because the cast of characters is so small, Weis is able to delve deeply into their characters, making them truly three-dimensional.<br /><br />Draconas really cares for humanity, despite the aloofness that being a dragon brings.  He finds himself wanting to guide and protect them, despite it being against the law.  On the other hand, he can be ruthless when the situation requires it.  Melisande is set in the ways of her society, and when that society breaks down, she is devastated.  She's even more devastated when it looks like Ballona is trying to kill her.  I found her a bit whiny at times, but overall she was a very strong character and it's not a surprise that she would whine a little bit given what happens to her.  Bellona is very loyal and tough, but with a very soft side when it comes to somebody she cares about.  She's not above killing people who used to be friends if she feels betrayed enough.  Edward is a relatively simple man, trying to get a job done, but finding himself caught unawares in Draconas' plans.  He's a pawn, he realizes he's a pawn, but he's willing to go along with it if it will save his kingdom, even though he doesn't know what is in store for him.<br /><br />Weis weaves a tapestry around these characters that is almost beautiful, but is also dark and ugly underneath.  A rape is very shortly but sharply described, devastating the character, and having harsh implications on later events.  The implications of other events in the book are also much darker than what I am used to from Weis.  I really enjoyed seeing the growth in her writing from previous books, with more mature subjects and a familiar yet expanded writing style.  While there are a few predictable moments, events take a very startling turn toward the end and the finale is breathtaking.  Weis even gives some of the predictable moments at the end of the book a very subtle twist, keeping you on your toes.<br /><br />Any flaws in the book are very small and may be rectified in future books (though that doesn't quite forgive this one).  I didn't feel like I really became part of the world that Weis created.  We get a description of the society inSeth, but we don't see any of it except for the Sisterhood.  The same goes for Idlyswylde, where we only see King Edward's court.  We don't get a sense of the land at all.  There is no map included, so we have to go completely by Weis' descriptions to get any sense of scale.  At times, I felt a bit lost as they traveled from place to place.<br /><br />Such flaws don't detract too much from the book, though.  This is an enjoyable, epic fantasy that doesn't feel that epic.  Instead, it feels like interesting events happening to characters you care about, as you watch them take on the hostile world around them.  You watch as their worlds get turned upside down, as they give in to temptation and passions, and as they fight to keep their sanity as the world changes around them.  Weis' first foray into fantasy without any helpers is a resounding success, and I can't wait to find out what happens next.<br /><br />David Royfor the Sisterhood.

US	50332419	R13D4GV662Q4P5	0743449096	690568493	The Last Roundup (Star Trek: the Original Series)	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Bringing the cows in to pasture	The Last Roundup is a Star Trek tale of Captain Kirk's final adventure before the events of Star Trek: Generations.  This being the final adventure, there are a lot of \\"I feel old\\" moments from Kirk, as well as a few of the other characters.  There are discussions of age and how things must finally be handed over to a new generation.  It's also quite a nice book, though it's very light without a lot of substance.<br />First of all, I will say that this isn't necessarily the \\"final adventure\\" for Captain Kirk, and it certainly isn't for the rest of the crew, who pop up in various books that take place after Generations.  The reason it's not Kirk's is because, while the epilogue takes place just as Kirk is getting ready to go inspect Enterprise-B, it takes place months after the end of the story, so there is definitely room for more.  Not that I think there should be, of course.<br />Now, as for the book itself, it should make any Trek fan happy.  It's a thoroughly competent, enjoyable story.  There's just not a lot of meat to it.  It's pretty short with a large typeface, so it's a quick read, and I certainly wouldn't pay hardcover prices for it.  If you're looking for depth, go elsewhere.  If you're looking for yet another adventure with some of your favourite characters, then this would be a good pickup at the library or in paperback.<br />My first complaint about it is that the original crew doesn't figure in it very much, with the exception of Scotty and Chekov.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, of course, as some of the better Trek books have involved only a few of the characters.  The problem is that they are featured in quite a few scenes, so why not make them a bigger part of the story?  As it is, they take up space that could have furthered the story elsewhere.  Uhura and McCoy are especially given short shrift.  They are helping Spock with the Klingon peace negotiations that resulted from the events in the movie Star Trek VI.  A number of scenes of these cultural and medical exchanges happen at the beginning of the book, but that's the extent of their contribution.  Sure, they go along for the ride with Spock after Kirk is reported missing, but they don't actually do anything.  They're background material, and they deserve better than that in their supposed \\"final adventure.\\"  Sulu is given just as short shrift, but he does get a couple of juicy scenes that also set the stage for future Sulu novels if Pocket Books is so inclined.  He's characterized very well, overall.<br />Not only are some of our favourite crewmembers sidelined, but their stories introduce more superfluous characters that clutter the book.  The Klingon opera singer is just filler, giving Uhura somebody to play off of (which, since Uhura doesn't do much involved with the story, seems even more needless).  The Klingons are only in the book to get Spock and the rest involved.  They don't do much but talk, fire a few weapons, and act as ferries for our heroes.<br />The story, what is left of it, is actually pretty good.  Kirk is feeling his age, and he's feeling useless.  He doesn't want to be stuck in a classroom, but there's nothing else active for him to do.  He wants to be in Starfleet, even if it only needs him as a teacher of the young.  The dynamics of Kirk's story are well done, with Kirk being involved just enough to make him the obvious hero of the story, but enough happens despite his actions or before he can intervene that he is shown that maybe it is time to stop pining for another starship.  He realizes that he has a new role in life, and that he must embrace it.  I thought Kirk's thought processes through this entire book were wonderful and Golden is to be commended for creating a story where Kirk has to deal with this without wallowing.  As a caveat to my point about McCoy above, he does figure very prominently in Kirk's conclusions, and the final talk between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy is a wonderful tribute to the friendship these threeshare.  As a Trek fan, I was moved by this scene, and it made the book worth finishing.<br />None of the other characters are very interesting, though they do serve their parts well.  Skalli, a cadet who becomes very attached to Kirk and serves as an illustration of what Kirk's reputation can do, is the most well-rounded.  Some have complained that she bounces back and forth between overly emotional and enormously competent, but I think Golden pulled off the difference.  I think readers who feel that way missed the point.  Like Kirk, they just saw the hysterical, annoying character, not realizing that it's perfectly possible for that sort of person to be skilled.  I did find her annoying at first, but I warmed to her after a bit.

As a Trek fan, I was moved by this scene, and it made the book worth finishing.<br />None of the other characters are very interesting, though they do serve their parts well.  Skalli, a cadet who becomes very attached to Kirk and serves as an illustration of what Kirk's reputation can do, is the most well-rounded.  Some have complained that she bounces back and forth between overly emotional and enormously competent, but I think Golden pulled off the difference.  I think readers who feel that way missed the point.  Like Kirk, they just saw the hysterical, annoying character, not realizing that it's perfectly possible for that sort of person to be skilled.  I did find her annoying at first, but I warmed to her after a bit.  There's also a female admiral who Kirk is friends with, and while there is a bit of sexual tension, it's obvious they're just good friends.

US	50332419	R20DI8H9QOUNLU	0671784943	666973728	The Left Hand of Destiny, Book 2 (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)	Books	3	2	4	N	N	I'll have a little Klingon mumbo-jumbo to go please	The Left Hand of Destiny: Book 2 continues almost exactly where Book 1 left off.  Unfortunately, while the quality of the book is still high, it's marred by some heavy mystical content that overpowers the book and brings it almost to a standstill at times.<br />Martok, the new chancellor of the Klingon Empire, has been deposed and is on the run.  The secret behind the usurper has been revealed to be a woman from Martok's past, a woman who Martok spurned when she tried to get him to join her and her father in their genetic manipulation schemes.  Using her genetic talents, she has reincarnated the Hur'q, the bane of the Klingon existence hundreds of years ago.  Now that she and the usurper have gained control of the Empire, what's next?  Is there a more personal slant to all of this?<br />Ezri Dax goes on personal leave from space station Deep Space 9 in order to help, and finds herself caught in a the middle of a lot of Klingon claptrap that she spoke out against earlier.  She does her duty to the Martok family anyway, aiding Worf and the crew of the Rotarran find an ancient Klingon weapon that will give Martok the power to wrest control of the Empire back from its thief.<br />Culminating in a final battle on the monastery planet Boreth, Martok's victory or defeat will result in major changes to the Empire.  Martok will have to win if he wants to guide the new Empire during its first baby steps.  If he doesn't, the Empire will crumble.<br />The writing in this book is almost better than the first book, as none of the mishaps that occurred in the first book present themselves.  There are no continuity errors (whether Trek-related or internal) and the prose seems to be tightened considerably.  The pacing at the start is very nice.  However, when things get to Boreth, the book takes a major nosedive.<br />The main problem with the book is the overpowering mysticism.  I do not have any problem with visions, dreams, fantasy figures, etc.  There has always been a small mystic undercurrent in some Trek stories that doesn't detract from them at all.  However, this time it drags the book to a screeching halt as Martok has yet more visions.  I have to admit I started losing track of things at this point, and just wanted the book to get moving again.  This mainly becomes a problem on Boreth, as I have no problems with the few times it happens to Martok before.<br />The mysticism, combined with the seemingly endless battle on the snow-clad plains makes the last third of the book a real struggle to get through.  Every time it seemed like the battle was going to end, something else happened to continue it.  It got very monotonous very quickly, and turned me right off.  The climax was is stunning yet a little too abrupt.  After the monotony of the final sequence, the climax suddenly happens and then it's over, with just a small epilogue taking place two months later.  While the pacing of earlier sections of the book is fine, the pacing of the ending really stinks.<br />All is not lost, however.  The fact that the television show is over gives Hertzler and Lang free reign with most of the characters, and some surprising fates await them.  I liked the fact that, for the most part, the reader has no idea whether or not danger will be fatal for a character.  It makes the book more suspenseful and it does help make the final battle a little more palatable.  If none of the characters were in any danger, this sequence would have been even more boring.  What's even better is that the fates of the characters are logical and believable.<br />The characterization is still strong and is one of the high points of the book (and its predecessor).  Martok has visibly grown into his role and he slowly begins to accept that he is what the Empire needs.  Kahless, the cloned Klingon emperor, also comes full circle and realizes what his place is in Klingon society.  Worf, Dax, and Worf's son Alexander are also in character, and interesting characters to boot.  The characterization of the villains isn't quite as good, but it's not as bad as the first book, where they were ciphers.  There were a few \\"I'm so evil\\" moments, especially for the female villain, but they weren't too bad.  I found the usurper extremely dull, though.  He gets more face-time in the book, but in this case it's a bad thing.  He rarely does anything but rant about his mother or Martok.<br />Pharh, though, is the breakthrough original character.  He grows away from his Ferengi heritage of commerce and business to become a very well-rounded character, so much so that Martok comes to respect him as he never would any other Ferengi.  Unfortunately, his is the one fate that is most predictable, but he's still interesting to read about.  While one would expect Hertzler to have Martok's characterization down pat (since he played Martok on the show), it's Pharh who shows that Hertzler is a very talented writer.<br />It's just the pacing that needs work.  If that improves, Hertzler will continue to be a fine Trek writer (assuming that's what he wants to do).  Still, this opening 2-book series is a wonderful step in the right direction and shows a lot of promise.  I wish I knew who was responsible for what in the book, because if it's Lang's fault, I'll apologize to Hertzler.  The problems just strike me as \\"new-writer syndrome\\" that will hopefully go away in time.  If you're a DS9 fan, you owe it to yourself to check out these two books.  Just try not to fall asleep getting to the end of the second one.<br />David Roye characterization of the villains isn't quite as good, but it's not as bad as the first book, where they were ciphers.

US	50332419	RP1KCEGAB5INY	0439139600	667539744	Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire	Books	5	2	2	N	N	I shall call him Wizard Boy	Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, is the 4th book in the ever-expanding Harry Potter series.  By ever-expanding, I don't just mean that the series is getting longer.  I'm talking about the books themselves.  Compared to the previous three books, this one is huge.  Weighing in at 734 pages, it's almost triple the size of The Prisoner of Azkaban.  Does the increased length hurt the book at all?  Not a bit.  In fact, this is probably the best book in the series.<br />It starts out as the same thoroughly charming narrative about Harry, his friends, and the lurking presence of Voldemort in his life.  There are some chilling events at the beginning of the book which show just how evil Voldemort and his minions really are.  However, these events are nothing compared to the ending.  This book takes the series in a darker direction, with an ending that will make you shiver.  The best part about it is that it's a surprise.  The entire book leads up to it, but you don't realize how until you actually get there.  Instead, you keep wondering just what Voldemort's plan is and why Harry is so important to it.  Because of that, for about 650 pages you are given an extra layer to the story.  There's the always enjoyable interaction between the characters and the adventures that they have, and the budding mystery behind it all.  This is a book I wasn't able to put down very easily.<br />The characters are much the same, though they do have a certain amount of growth that is common in moving from thirteen years old to fourteen.  Harry's starting to think even more about girls, especially Cho Chang.  He's still awkward around them, though, and acts like a typical teenager.  Ron hasn't changed a whole lot, but I don't think he ever will.  Some kids are like that, too.  Hermione has probably changed the most, as she has become an activist.  Events at the beginning of the novel inspire her to have a cause and create an organization to further that cause.  It's too bad that Rowling couldn't make this aspect of her character more interesting, though.  Whenever Hermione brought up the subject, the book took a major downturn and I became bored very quickly.  Thankfully, though, these sequences are short so the book doesn't lose too much momentum.  Unfortunately, this is going to be an ongoing plot line, so I hope Rowling can make it more interesting in the future.  The interaction between the three characters is what makes the book so good, though.  They bicker, they make up, they stand up for each other to the end.  They are the perfect group of friends and they make the book a joy to read.<br />The minor characters are done just as well.  Dumbledore, the head of the school, is still the mysterious but always helpful old man that he's been throughout the series.  He's never rattled, never quick to anger, and always willing to help Harry when he needs it the most.  The other regular teachers are just as good, with the exception of Trelawney who is yet again terribly boring and one-note, always predicting that Harry will suffer some horrible fate.  However, it's the new characters that shine in this one.  Mad-Eye Moody, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, is vividly portrayed.  He's paranoid, always looking over his shoulder with his magic eye that can see through things, but he's enormously helpful to Harry when the chips are down.  He harbours a secret though, and throughout the book you think you know what it is.  But you don't, really.  He's incredibly interesting and his characterization is wonderful.  The other new character is Rita Skeeter, a slimy reporter for The Daily Prophet newspaper.  She keeps writing stories about Harry that are completely untrue, making up quotes that make him look pompous and/or stupid.  Harry is always embarrassed by these stories and his reputation around school takes a turn for the worse and everybody thinks he's a glory-hog.  While I found Rita's character suitably smarmy, unfortunately the end of her story didn't do as much for me.  It almost felt tacked on, like Rowling almost forgot to end it and then had to backtrack to put in clues to it.<br />The plot of the book, with its mysterious tournament between the three schools and Harry's involvement in it, is thrilling.  You really feel for Harry as he is constantly tormented by his classmates who think that he entered just out of a desire for attention.  The events themselves are suitably exciting, showcasing Harry's charity and his quick-thinking.  Ron finally cracks under the pressure of always being in Harry's shadow, and they actually have a truly believable fight.  As I said above, I didn't like Hermione's subplot very much, but she did a wonderful job in a supporting role for the other plots.  The atmosphere gets darker and darker, and then there is the ending.  All of a sudden, it's midnight, getting ready for a very dark book 5.  For the first time, you get the sense that this is one long story told over a number of books, rather than a series of adventures about Harry and his friends.  The book leaves you hanging, and I really felt sorry for the people who had to wait three years for it, instead of just moving on to the next book like I was able to do.<br />This is a wonderful addition to the series, and it keeps getting better and better.

US	50332419	R2NAVXTTBTYTQ3	0671784935	465969028	The Left Hand of Destiny, Book 1 (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	An Empire of Ashes	The Left Hand of Destiny: Book 1 is the first book of a two-part story about the new Klingon Chancellor, Martok.  If you have seen Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, you have seen Martok as a general.  At the end of the series, Martok was raised to Chancellor of the Klingon Empire.  This is the story of his journey home from Deep Space Nine, and what awaits him when he gets there.  It is very well-written for a first-time author and the book packs quite a punch for any Trek fan.<br />J.G. Hertzler played Martok on the television show, so you can tell that this story is near to his heart.  Usually when an actor decides to write a book, it doesn't turn out to be very good.  The success rate is a little better when the book is about the character they've played.  Trek has a good track record in this, though.  Andy Robinson wrote the wonderful Stitch in Time and Armin Shimmerman co-wrote The 34th Rule about his Ferengi character.  Both of those books were wonderful.<br />Hertzler adds another one to the pile.  If you're a Trek fan and an admirer of Martok, this is definitely the book for you.  It is well-written (with a couple of missteps detailed below) and very interesting.  It brings back many familiar characters from the television show, but none of them feel forced.  They all serve a purpose and are appropriate for this story.  Not only that, but Hertzler captures their characterization really well.  I don't know if that's Lang's influence or if Hertzler picked it all up while being on the show, but there are no out of character moments in this book.  Worf and his son Alexander are the most recognizable of the bunch, but characters from Martok's family also show up and are perfectly captured from the one episode that featured them.  Emperor Kahless is almost a brand new character, since he didn't really get a lot of characterization in the one episode that featured him.  In addition to that, he has changed a great deal since that time.  He adds a bit of colour to everything.<br />The original characters are also interesting, though the villains are a bit one-note and moustache-twirling to suit my taste.  There are very few scenes from their viewpoint, but it still felt a little off.  The other main original character, Pharh the Ferengi, is priceless though.  He provides a lot of the comic relief in the novel, but he's also an intelligent character.  He's not like most Ferengi.  While commerce and money are still everything to him, he's not as mercenary as most of the members of his race.  Instead, he's a three dimensional character who is a joy to read about.  The interaction between Martok and him not only adds to Martok's character but also makes the story more entertaining as a whole.<br />Of course, the tour de force is Martok himself.  Hertzler shows that he truly understood the character he played on the show.  Martok is deep, brooding, and hesitant to assume this role that has been thrust upon him.  He loves his people and the Empire, but he does not see himself as the savior that they need.  He feels he is simply a man, not a symbol.  He would dearly love to put down the mantle of responsibility that he has been given when the usurper shows up, but he knows he can't.  I could hear Hertzler's characteristic growl whenever Martok spoke in the book, and that's a tribute to the authors.  The good thing about these Deep Space Nine books is that the characters can grow and change.  We learn a lot about Martok in this book, even as he learns a lot about himself and his limits.  We get a history for him that he never had on the show.  I think it produced an even more well-rounded character (though he was wonderful in the show as well).  Kudos to Hertzler for this one.<br />There are a couple of missteps that bring the level of the book down a little bit.  These missteps are something any first-time author could do, though you would hope the editors would catch it.  First, in a couple of scenes, characters appear (or at least they'rethoughts do) even when they aren't actually in the scene.  For example, a scene is told from Alexander's point of view, and there is one instance in that scene where we also get Martok's impressions of what's going on.  He is watching the same thing from elsewhere, so we really shouldn't be getting his thoughts at this time.  The fact that his name only appears once in the scene makes me think that the authors just lost track for a moment.  Secondly, some of the action is just impossible as it's described.  In one scene, one of the characters does a back-flip through somebody's legs.  I had to do a double-take for a moment.  These and other small problems plague the book and bring it down from a 5-star effort.  All of them could have been fixed with a quick re-reading, and I would have thought Lang would know better.<br />Still, this is a wonderful book from a new writer.  Book 2 sounds like a roller-coaster ride as well.  I hope we get some more Martok stories from Hertzler in the future.

The guy played Tom Cervo on Mystery Science Theater 3000, for heaven's sake!  Of course it was going to be funny.  Then I read Mike Nelson's Movie Megacheese and I thought &quot;uh oh.&quot;  If one alumnus from the show wrote such an unfunny book (and he was the star of the show in the later years!), what would this guy do?  So when I got the call from the library that it was in, I wasn't that enthused.  But it did sound like an interesting concept, so I said &quot;What the heck?&quot; and dove in.<br />Am I glad I did.  This is a fantastic book.  The interesting concept is that Kevin spent the entirety of 2001 going to a movie.  Every day.  Without fail (though he did almost miss a couple).  Home rentals didn't count.  One emergency in Italy necessitated watching a movie on TV, but that was the only time. Airline movies counted only because otherwise he wouldn't be able to travel anywhere.  Instead, he traveled all over the world to fulfill his promise to his readers.  He visited the Midnight Sun Film Festival in Finnish Lapland, where the sun never sets and everybody gets funky from weird sleep patterns.  He went to Australia and visited the smallest movie theater in the world (around 25 seats).  At home or abroad, he paid for at least one movie every day of the year.  It's a project that I found impossible to resist, and I even envied him a little bit.  Here was a guy who was going to write a book from the audience's perspective.  He is one of us, just wanting to see movies.<br />The wonderful thing about this book is that it's not just a list of movies, or even a critique of them.  He does judge some of the movies and tells us what he thinks of them.  No, this book is a love letter.  Murphy's passion for film shines through in every essay, and you can really tell that he loves the cinema.  Every chapter covers a week in his journey, but he never mentions all of the movies he watched that week (though they are conveniently listed at the top of the chapter heading, with location included).  Each essay, thus every week, has a theme.  One week, it was the Sundance Film Festival.  Another, it was Cannes.  Another, it was Quebec City and the hotel and theater made completely of snow and ice.  Sometimes, he just uses the week's films to talk about a cinema subject dear to his heart, like silent movies, or classic comedy shorts.  The chapter for November 19-25, he details how he smuggled an entire Thanksgiving Dinner into a movie theater.  The topics go all over, but in every one of them, you can see Murphy's love shining through.<br />Passion is not the only thing Murphy has, though.  He has wit as well, and each essay has its share of it.  Murphy doesn't constantly tell jokes and hope the reader laughs (which didn't work for Nelson but Joe Queenan does so well).  Instead, the wit comes out of his personality and is a little more subtle.  I found this book amusing, but not laugh out loud funny (with the exception of a couple of instances that would take too long to explain).  The thing is, amusing is fine when the book is well-written and you enjoy reading it like I did this one.  I expected a retrospective of bad movies similar to Nelson's book, but I guess he figured that had already been done.  Not only had it been done, but it goes against everything Murphy wanted to get out of this project.  After ten years of being on the show, watching cheesy movies and creating jokes for Joel and Mike (and himself as well) to tell, he wanted to spark his love for the cinema again.  He wanted to become an audience member again and revisit exactly why he loves movies.  Thus, this was the perfect thing to do.<br />I was especially interested in (and envious of) the travel he did.  He went to France, Italy, Finland, Australia, Mexico, and the Cook Islands, which is where he was on September 11.  He tells this in a very poignant essay, saying how he felt when he heard the news, the reactions of the other islanders, and how he almost gave up his odyssey because it felt very insignificant.  But then he went to see Waking Ned Devine, shared a few laughs with friends even through their tears, and realized the human togetherness that movies bring, and that feeling of closeness that you get in a good movie crowd, even if you don't know any of them.  You still share this one bond, this one movie, and you feel better.  This essay actually brought a tear to my eye, something I really didn't expect in a book I thought would be a comedy.<br />A Year at the Movies contains 52 essays about the entire cinema experience.  Kevin even worked for a theater for two nights and got to see exactly what a theater employee gets to see.  He finds out that American movie-goers are pretty much slobs.  Sure, there are a couple of clunkers in there.  But you know, I wouldn't even call them clunkers.  They were all interesting in their own right, just a few that were less so than the rest.  Through his journey, he regains his love of film, his affection for that flashing light and flickering screen, and he brings us along with him. He's not the most wonderful writer in the world, but he makes up for it with an intensity about his subject that's contagious.  I've never been a huge movie person, but he almost made me become one.<br />I think I'll go watch a Buster Keaton short film.<br />David Royhe news, the reactions of the other islanders, and how he almost gave up his odyssey because it felt very insignificant.

However, it also brings in some TV shows and some essays about celebrities and some celebrity families as well.  I thought it would be a book filled with wry and funny comments on films similar to the comments made on Mystery Science Theater 3000, a show where Mike was the head writer for 10 seasons and the on-air host for 5.  Unfortunately, it doesn't keep the magic that the television show did.<br />Instead, this book is such an eclectic mix of both subject matter and quality that my head hurt after a while.  There would be a couple of funny entries, and then dead silence from me for another two or three.  There didn't seem to be any middle ground.  The book is divided into nine sections, most with obvious titles.  First, there are action movies (where he takes aim at the rather large target of Jean-Claude Van Damme, for one).  Then there are the animal movies, though for some reason Batman is included.  I understand the \\"Bat\\" motif with the animals, but with all of the other movies being actually about animals in some way, this felt a little forced.  Then Mike starts talking about television shows.  Then there are science fiction movies, acting families (like the Baldwin brothers), Chick Flix, the Legends (like Brando), a catch-all chapter with movies that don't fit into his subjects, and finally \\"megacheese.\\"  This chapter consists of two movies:  The Blair Witch Project, and the movie version of Mystery Science Theater.<br />The book starts out on a good note, with some good and funny essays about action movies.  Then again, these are the easiest targets.  He takes some easy potshots at Steven Seagal as well as Van Damme here.  The essays are better in this section and the book hasn't slowed to a crawl, though there are a couple of clunkers here.  When he talks about Val Kilmer's The Saint, he continually (and annoyingly) makes fun of the original author's name, Leslie Charteris.  He constantly changes his name to \\"Margaret,\\" \\"Rachel,\\" and others.  I didn't find it funny in the slightest, though he did make some good points about Kilmer and how he always gets the girl even though he acts in ways that no real woman would fall for (like stealing the Evil Russian formula from her bra).  The animal movies chapter has the wonderfully funny essay on Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas' The Ghost and the Darkness, where he hits home run after home run with his witty comments.  He comments on the stupidity of some of the things they do, like trying to lure the lions into a trap by dousing an abandoned hospital with blood and then lying in wait.  Of course, the lions attack the hospital that the patients had been moved to.  Some of his best essays are in this section.<br />Unfortunately, the book hits a brick wall when it starts talking about television, and it never recovers.  I don't think I laughed once at any of these.  In the essay on \\"Savannah,\\" the Aaron Spelling soap, he spends more time talking about \\"Melrose Place.\\"  In fact, this is one of Mike's problems in almost all of his essays (even the good ones).  He starts going down tangents and then milks them for all they're worth.  He spends two or three paragraphs on them sometimes, and they're pointless and not funny.  In an essay that only goes two or three pages, two paragraphs can be a lot.  I could forgive him if they made me laugh (Mark Steyn, my favourite newspaper columnist, does this all the time, and they're usually hilarious), but they don't.  I found myself wondering when he'd get back to the point.  Then again, in some of the essays, even the point isn't that interesting.<br />He has a couple of good essays after this section, but they're hard to find.  The one on the Sheen family is pretty good and his tearing apart of What Dreams May Come almost equals The Ghost & the Darkness, though I could have done without the gratuitous \\"Mork & Mindy\\" bit.  He points out that every time he foundhimself laughing out loud at the corny imagery in the movie, something tragic happens (like Robin Williams' wife killing herself).  He said it ruined the fun, and from the way he describes the movie, I can only agree.  Finally, his essay on the career of Joe Eszterhas is really good too.  I especially like how he says that the people protesting Basic Instinct got it completely wrong.  Since it's such an awful movie, protesting it is pointless.  As he says, \\"If you find something offensive in an episode of, say, `Webster,' it's best to just leave it alone and let the problem disappear by itself.\\"<br />But that's really about it.  There are some other amusing moments, but nothing major.  He is capable of a truly wickedly funny aside, as long as he doesn't dwell on them.  Sometimes, they come out of left field and make you laugh despite yourself, such as when he's talking about Blade and he makes a comment about vampires being all over the place with \\"the Count from `Sesame Street' being just the tip of the iceberg.\\"  It may not be funny on it's own, but in the context of the essay and the suddenness that it hits you as you're reading, it really works.<br />There's not enough meat in this book.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by other humour writers.  Or perhaps I've been spoiled by Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Whatever the case, I thought this book would be a lot better than it is.  If you find it in a bookstore, check out the essays I mention.  If you can get it at the library, even better.

I've loved the other two books by him that I've read, but this one is different.  First, it's a whole book rather than a collection of essays.  Secondly, it's short, only 188 pages.  This surprised me until I actually read it.  But it is still just as funny as I know Queenan can be.<br />In this book, he starts on a pop-culture odyssey and has a hard time coming back from it.  Unlike Odysseus' odyssey, though, he doesn't have a family (or a wife) waiting for him back home while he journeys.  Instead, he drags them along with him, kicking and screaming.  He's always been sort of a snob, sneering at various popular items that he wouldn't be caught dead attending or visiting.  Everything that he's always loathed from afar, he decides that he must now experience.  He's getting bored with his intellectual life, and he wants to see how \\"the masses\\" live.  So he dives in to the deep end, starting off with seeing \\"Cats\\" on Broadway. He's managed to avoid even thinking about it for 14 years, but now he decides he has to see it.  It is an eye-opening experience, and one that's just the gateway to the pop culture Hades.  Soon, he's listening to Michael Bolton and Kenny G, going to Red Lobster and Taco Bell, and generally becoming one of us.  Internally, he's a bit sickened by the whole thing, but soon he becomes addicted to it.  He can't live without getting up at 8:00 in the morning for \\"Starsky & Hutch.\\"  His is a journey between Scylla and Charibdis and around the island of the Sirens.  He will find himself in dangerous waters, almost dying (well, his brain, anyway).  And what a ride it is.<br />Queenan definitely has a way with words.  He's also very abrasive and condescending at times, so he's not for everybody.  He insults a lot of popular things in this book.  If you're like me, you'll find yourself laughing uproariously even when he's going after something you really like.  There will be other times when you'll be nodding your head in complete agreement (most likely when he's talking about Michael Bolton).  He can be an acquired taste, though, so you may want to leaf through the book before buying it, just to make sure.  Don't worry where you leaf to.  Wherever you go, he'll be going after something.  However, if you find you don't mind this, his style of writing is incredible.  It flows very easily and reads very quickly.  I read this book in three sessions and it didn't take more than 45 minutes each time (and for me, that's fast).  I found myself unable to put it down.<br />Probably the funniest bit in the whole book is when he has a dream about a world-wide conspiracy of morons taking over the world.  He thought originally that it was just random, that morons were all over the place but they weren't organized.  But then he's drafted to infiltrate the moron brigade and find out what they're planning.  His indoctrination (which he's already started by going on this journey) is intense, and his life hinges on his familiarity with the television show \\"Touched by and Angel.\\"  This sequence lasts for about three pages, and it is truly hilarious.  Another bit that stands out are his description of seeing \\"Victor Victoria\\" on stage three times in a couple months, with three different stars: Julie Andrews, Liza Minnelli and Raquel Welch.  Very hideous, but very outrageous.  Even his 13-year-old daughter, who he drags to Minnelli's show, knows that something is wrong here.<br />He outdoes himself when he goes to Vegas, though.  One of his main themes once he starts down this road is that a number of the things he sees and places he goes to have a certain \\"scheissenbedauern,\\" or the feeling that something really stinks, but doesn't stink as much as you secretly hoped it would.  He finds himself disappointed by the mediocrity of so much that he experiences, when he wanted it to be truly horrible.  Vegas was a good example, and he has somereally complimentary things to say about Wayne Newton (and Barry Manilow in an earlier section).  Too many things are just bad, rather than being mind-blowingly awful.  This does not apply to his visit to Branson, Missouri, and this visit almost cures him of his addiction.<br />This is a hilarious book, and watching Joe sink deeper and deeper into the depths of pop culture, to the point where he can't get himself out of it, is very interesting.  However, the book does have a couple of shortcomings.  Both of these are actually alleviated by mitigating factors or are easily solvable.  The first is that the book is so short.  This sort of ruins the entertainment value of the book and makes you wonder about spending that kind of money for a 188 page book.  However, after reading it, I completely understand.  As good as the book is, I don't think it could have supported much more length.  The second problem is that the wisecracks and insults of things that you might happen to enjoy (like \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" for me) can get a bit old after awhile if you're reading it all in one sitting.  The solution for that, though, is to put it down for a little while and take a break.  Easily solved.<br />I really enjoyed this book, and this view of popular culture from an \\"outside\\" source.  If you're in the mood to laugh and you find that Queenan is to your taste, this is another excellent example of his writing.  Give it a try.  Just take it in smaller doses then usual.<br />David Royreally complimentary things to say about Wayne Newton (and Barry Manilow in an earlier section).

US	50332419	R1AK7RLJNMLX52	0439136369	667539744	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Dark prisoner	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, is the third book in the Harry Potter series (as if I had to tell you that).  I've read the first book and seen the second movie, but I decided that I wanted to see what this phenomenon was all about for myself.  As with the first book, I found Prisoner to be a thoroughly charming tale, filled with wonder, suspense, interesting writing and fun characters.  It was a fitting sequel to the first two stories.<br />First of all, Prisoner is the last of the \\"short\\" Harry Potter books (with the next two books weighing very hefty on the page scale), but its story doesn't seem to suffer at all.  Rowling packs a lot of story into so few pages.  The pace is fairly relentless.  I think it does suffer a little bit, though, from the beginning.  As with the first two stories, the Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia scenes seem a little pointless and tacked on.  The sequence doesn't seem to have a lot of purpose other than to get the ball rolling.  While they aren't bad scenes and I did enjoy them a little bit, I kept waiting for the action to start.  I hope that they start getting development beyond the typical \\"snarky family who hates Harry for what he is and wants to keep him down\\" portrayal we've seen so far.  But this book doesn't do it.<br />Once things get started, though, the tale becomes much more interesting as Rowling adds to the rich background of the universe she's created.  She keeps adding new things and characters to her world, and each one of them is intriguing.  The story behind Sirius Black and what happened with Harry's parents is fascinating, and the twists and turns this particular story takes are particularly good.  As events come to their conclusion, you're riveted to your seat as you want to find out what really happened (I read the last hundred pages in one night, staying up much too late).  There is also a nice moral point for the kids (who are the primary audience for these books, despite them being wonderful books for adults too) where the correction of one injustice is used to correct another one as well.  This makes a wonderful point about injustice and how one must fight against it, no matter who is perpetrating it.<br />I found Hermione's story very predictable, though.  I figured out what was going on with her the first time the question came up.  Rowling does dovetail it nicely with the main story though, giving it a purpose rather than just showing how eccentric Hermione can be sometimes.  I didn't like the antipathy between Hermione and Ron as much, though.  I thought it was a bit overdone.  I know it is realistic in the sense that kids can hold grudges over the most minor of things sometimes, but I didn't find it that pleasant to read about in this case.  I had trouble seeing how Hermione couldn't understand that Ron was upset that her cat kept attacking his rat.  At least the antipathy grew from their already established characters, so that was nice.  Most of the other things they quarrel about are rules-related, and with Hermione being such a stickler for the rules and with the added pressure of her schedule, it is a bit understandable that there would be friction.<br />The two new professors, Lupin and Trelawney, are a mixed bag.  Lupin is wonderful, with an intriguing secret and an interesting interaction with Harry.  He becomes almost like a mentor to him, and one starts to wonder if there are sinister motives behind it all.  Lupin was also involved with Harry's parents, and the reader is left to wonder throughout the story whether or not Lupin is on the up and up.  Telawney, on the other hand, I found dreadfully boring.  The only thing of interest she did was predict Harry's imminent death, but every time she appeared on the page after that, I almost started snoring.  She was annoying, too, with all of her \\"oh, I predicted that\\" statements.  She got on my nerves after awhile, and I don't think Rowling did a good job characterizing her.  She could have played an important part in the book, but Rowling drops the ball a little bit.<br />Finally, the Dementors and the description of Azkaban prison are really well-done.  The mystery behind them and their effect on Harry, the fear and awe they inspire in everybody, is just incredibly done.  There is a real sense of menace with them, especially when Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster of the school, won't allow them on to school grounds.  Harry really grows up when he ultimately has to face them.  I don't think I'd want to see much more about them, but their presence in this book was extremely satisfying.  These are supposed to be \\"the good guys,\\" but they're more feared then Sirius Black, I think.  That's what makes them interesting.<br />I was a bit surprised at the tone of the book.  It seemed pretty dark for a so-called children's book.  I've been surprised by the first two stories as well, but this was even a little bit darker than those.  Children are obviously lapping these books up, though, and apparently reading them and loving them, so I guess I'm wrong about that.  If I had children though, I'd definitely want to make sure my children were ready for these before I gave them the books.  However, on the upside, the \\"adult\\" writing makes it a wonderful story for all ages.  If you enjoyed the first two, you can't go wrong with this one either.<br />David Roymportant part in the book, but Rowling drops the ball a little bit.<br />Finally, the Dementors and the description of Azkaban prison are really well-done.

Rising Son is part of the post-television continuity  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.  Not only that, but it runs parallel with all of the other books except Avatar.  It explains what happened to Jake Sisko after he disappeared into the wormhole during that book, and his experiences as he tries to get home (or tries to decide whether or not he even wants to go home).  It's a very intriguing character study of young Jake and it includes an interesting plot as well.  We've been waiting months and months to find out what happened to Jake, and it was well worth the wait.<br />If you're a fan of Deep Space 9, especially the post-television continuity, this is a must-own book for you.  I've only read a couple of the newer books, but I've wondered when the Jake story would be told, and I'm glad they waited until the tenth anniversary of the show to tell it.  Perry writes a very satisfying book, with interesting characters and a good story to go with it.  I enjoyed reading about Jake and the touch decisions he has to make in it.  Perry really portrayed well the tug-of-war between Jake's new friends and his ideals.  The crew is not the most honest bunch around, and they make some of their living by doing illegal things.  They don't do things out of the goodness of their hearts and helping people is only a priority if they are getting paid.  This goes completely against how Jake was brought up and he finds himself doubting.  Should he stay with these people who have accepted him?  Should he build his own life, away from the Federation and from being \\"Ben Sisko's son?\\"  Is sacrificing his ideals worth it?  And then when the prophecy rears its ugly head again, Jake is even more torn.  It seems like, even this far away from home, Ben Sisko is reaching out to grab him and pull him in.  Jake's final decision looks more and more obvious as things progress (Dez can't understand why Jake is having a problem with the way they do things, and thinks he needs to grow up), but it's still heart-wrenching to see him go through it.  I think this would be a marvelous vehicle for Cirroc Lofton (the actor who played Jake) if a TV movie ever got made (not that it will happen of course).  I think that's the highest compliment to the book.<br />Dez is an good contrast to Jake.  He desperately wants Jake to like him, to give Jake the opportunity that he never had with his own father.  He is baffled by Jake's ethical code that has a problem with the way he does things.  He finally decides to pretend that they will become a more altruistic crew while Jake becomes further immersed in the crew's life.  Then, when Jake is unable to get himself out, he'll force Jake to realize that what they do is not a bad thing.  While you don't like what Dez does, you can understand it and almost sympathize with him.  It makes him a sad character in a way, and as you watch Jake agonize, you know that there is no real good or bad side in this conflict.  There are only a couple of times where the character doesn't ring true, as he goes just that little bit further to convince Jake and seems to go over the top.  It's not often, though, and Dez turns out to be a fascinating character to read about.<br />The crew of the Even Odds is an eclectic bunch, with a few familiar Alpha Quadrant races (2 Ferengi and a Cardassian) and one Gamma Quadrant race we're familiar with (the Wadi).  Thus, Perry can wrap her other, unfamiliar characters in a sheet of familiarity that Trek fans can handle.  I'm a bit disappointed in that aspect, but Perry does a good enough job with them that it's not a bad thing.  The Caradassian is fairly non-descript, though he does learn some things during the course of the story.  The Ferengi are stereotypical, but it's the new races that are so very interesting.  The best of the bunch is Stessie, a joined being with numerous different facets.  Only one can talk, but all the facets have their own personality even as they are part of the whole.  While this sort of thing has been done before (even in Trek), Perry imbues the character with an interesting personality that makes her (it?) a wonderful piece of work.  The other crew members aren't really that interesting, fulfilling their roles admirably but not doing much else.  Facity, the Wadi first officer and Dez's lover, provides an interesting viewpoint as she watches the interplay between Jake and Dez, but I didn't find much of interest in her personally.  She serves almost as a spectator, viewing the game between the two of them and commenting on it.<br />The writing is standout for a Star Trek book, with no real waste or padding visible in the book.  The only pointless point of the story is the ending, where a surprise personality from the television series meets up with them, adding a slight bit of tension but then quickly dissipating it.  The story also ends with a \\"To Be Continued,\\" but in itself it is fairly self-contained.  If you're just interested in what happened to Jake, you will find that out and don't have to continue further if you don't want to (but what DS9 book fan will not want to continue?).<br />The book is well-written enough that if you're not a fan, you would probably still enjoy it.

US	50332419	R3GZ3MCTA3YEWM	0670031909	409938290	Lost in a Good Book: A Thursday Next Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	N	I'm in love with Thursday Next	Lost in a Good Book is the next adventure in the saga of Thursday Next, intrepid literary detective.  Fforde takes the reader on another exploration of great literature, but makes it accessible even to the readers who haven't really read any of them. This book is an excellent addition to the mythos.  It's a fast-paced romp that will leave you smiling and intrigued at the same time.<br />Fforde takes the world that he created in The Eyre Affair and adds even more to it.  In fact, he creates an entire fictional world beneath the \\"reality\\" that Thursday lives in.  Characters from literature can travel to the real world, or to other books.  An entire infrastructure of literary characters is charged with defending literature against evil-doers.  The Jurisfiction organization, centered in the Great Library where every book (even books that only potentially existed) is housed, fights against everything from vicious creatures that eat vocabulary to Bowdlerisers, who travel through fiction trying to eliminate obscenity and profanity from it.  In her travels, Thursday becomes the apprentice to Miss Havisham, from Great Expectations, a master book-jumper.  All of this is in an attempt to learn how to get into \\"The Raven\\" and save her husband.  Once again, I have to credit Fforde's imagination.  There are so many cool concepts in this book that I won't give you any more.  It would spoil some of the fun.<br />Also like the first book, this is a triumph of prose and imagery over character, as most of the characters don't have a lot of depth to them.  They are mostly part of the joke, or part of the scenery.  Thursday is one exception to this, and Miss Havisham is the other.  Havisham is a wonderful character, taking what Dickens created and adding to it.  It's very interesting to see Havisham interacting with Pip and Estella as part of the book, and then when the scenes switches to a new chapter and away from her, she becomes even more animated.  These characters know that they are characters in a book, they speak their lines and do their bit, and then they go off to live their own life.  Every chapter adds more and more to Fforde's world.<br />One way in which this is different from the first book, however, is that Fforde doesn't concentrate as much in the alternate reality that Thursday lives in.  We get an update on how things are going (the Crimean War peace talks, for one thing), but for the most part, everything takes place either in the books themselves, or in the real world but with lots of literary characters bumbling about.  For example, Havisham is a hoot when she gets behind the wheel of a car.  If you can imagine an 18th century spinster with a lead foot, you will get the picture.  It's hilarious to see, and to read about.  I constantly found myself marveling at what Fforde was producing, and didn't notice that the characters were kind of plot devices.<br />However, once again, the writing is wonderful.  Fforde has a very smooth style that almost feels literary.  It's almost the perfect mix between classic literature and today's fiction.  Part of that is helped by the other fictional characters being around (most of them being from classical literature anyway), but a lot of it is the prose itself.  The plot is interesting in itself and there are some godawful puns (those are the best kind).  Some of the events in the novel seem to come out of left field, but everything ultimately has a good reason for happening, which is nice.  A couple of times I groaned at how something was resolved, thinking it looked too much like writer's fiat, but then something else happened that explained exactly why that resolution occurred.  Considering how twisty the book can get at times, that's no mean feat.<br />I greatly enjoyed this novel, though not quite as much as the first.  I'm not sure why that is, because it seems just as good as the first one.  Maybe I would have liked a little more real-world action.  In the first book, I reveled in thescenes like the Rocky Horror Picture Show-style rendition of Richard III.  Those sorts of details were missing in this one (though the beginning, when Thursday goes on the talk show, is a complete scream).  There were a couple of seemingly useless items.  There's no reason that I can see for the mammoths to be around, other than as interesting scenery.  In a book that's full of imagery, that's not usually a bad thing, but this time it seemed like they would have a purpose, and then they didn't.<br />Fforde has shown, yet again, that he is a master at this sort of thing.  He uses wonderful language, interesting images, and a great plot.  Don't pick up this book for the wonderful characters, though.  Fforde concentrates more on making the characters do interesting things than in actually making them interesting themselves.  Except for Thursday, of course.  She is the ultimate, and I love her to death.  You also don't have to be afraid of not having read classic fiction and thus not being able to understand the book.  While I'm sure it would be enhanced if you are familiar with it, it's not a necessity to get most of the jokes.

While I'm sure it would be enhanced if you are familiar with it, it's not a necessity to get most of the jokes.  All in all, I really felt like I was Lost in a Good Book.	2003-06-21

Sisters of the Raven is a novel of magic and mystery, with political and religious intrigue.  As usual, Hambly sets the scene very well, and it was nice to get away from the characters she's known for and to get to know some other people.  With an interesting world and good characters to populate it, Hambly recovers from her last fantasy debacle (Dragonstar) to hit one out of the park.<br />Ahhhhh, a stand-alone novel from Barbara Hambly.  I've been waiting for this for a long time.  Hambly has such a good touch with characters and setting that I've been wanting to see something original from her for a long time.  She has two long-running series (Benjamin January and the series that takes place in the world of Dragonsbane) that I was beginning to wonder about her.  But no more.  Here, she shows off her creative talents once again.  The world she creates lives and breathes.  The characters leap off the page in full three dimensions (except when it's not necessary).  Her descriptions of everyday life are scrumptious.  As characters walk down the street, you get the feeling that you're walking down the street with them.  She is a wonderful scene-setter, and you never know what detail is going to be important because she provides you with so much.  The setting is so rich that I have no complaints, but if you don't like a lot of description, you may find yourself skimming this book (and most of her others) at times.  Personally, though, I think that'' one of her strengths.<br />As I've pointed out before, though, this only works when the story she's telling is good and the characters are interesting.  It can really drag when the rest of the book doesn't support it.  However, that's not a problem here.  Even the bit characters are distinctive, even if they don't truly have a third side.  She has created a very interesting society, where women generally don't even have their own names, but instead titles: the Summer Concubine, Corn-Tassel Woman, Pomegranate Woman.  Even so, you can always tell them apart.  The only time it's difficult is if they don't appear on the page but are only talked about.  But even then it's not too bad.  Oryn and the Summer Concubine have a wonderful relationship based on love and trust.  She acts as she does because society demands it, but she also wields great power behind the scenes, and Oryn trusts her completely.  Raeshaldis is the other main character, and she's remarkably drawn as well.  Hambly does a wonderful job of crafting her.  We see the naivete of a young woman who's a little bit out of her element, but she is confident in some of her spells (such as the cloak that hides her when she walks around sometimes).  She's ridiculed and hazed by the other male students at the college, and it hurts her.  But she's strong-willed and willing to do what it takes to learn her trade.  She's courageous when she has to find out what is stalking her and the other female mages around the city.  And she's intelligent.  Hambly puts all these character traits together and produces a character that you want to read about.<br />The villains aren't badly done either.  Mohrvine, Oryn's uncle, is power-hungry, but he's practical as well.  He'll use whomever he needs to use in order to take over the throne, but he's not afraid to side with the good guys when he has to.  He's the ultimate opportunist, but he does believe he's doing what's best for the realm.  Oryn has always been a bit of a dandy and Mohrvine doesn't think that he's strong enough to be king.  Lohar is not as well drawn, and he's more of a plot device then a true character.  He's fairly one-note (though instantly recognizable when he's on the page), and his religious rantings did grow a bit tiresome after awhile.  Thankfully, while he does appear a lot as the unrest in the city gets worse, his parts are in small doses so he doesn't outstay his welcome.  And the way Oryn finally gets him is priceless, and perfectly in character for Oryn.<br />The plot is small and local, which is a nice change of pace from the threats to the entire world that inhabit so many other fantasy novels.  There is great magic involved, but it's all done on a small scale, with individual characters and one society being affected.  As I stated before, Hambly's descriptions are wonderful, but her prose in other areas is good as well.  There isn't a whole lot of action, but what's there is clearly described.  The final confrontation is breath-taking.  The dialogue is good as well. The only thing that mars it just slightly is some of the repetition involved.  I know it's there for effect, but it grated a bit after awhile.  This repetition is mainly when characters think the same thing over and over within the section that they're in.  It's used to show how important what they're thinking about is, and how it weighs on their mind, and can be effective in small doses.  I think Hambly overuses it just a little bit.<br />Still, that doesn't detract from what is a wonderful fantasy novel.  The best thing about it is that it's self-contained.  I don't see any sequel coming out of this one, and I think that it would be forcing it to produce one.  The story ends, the society goes on, and the conclusion seems natural.  As much as I loved the book and the characters in it, I really hope Hambly doesn't revisit them.  I think, like what happened to Dragonsbane, further books would only cheapen the magic that this one carries.<br />If you're a fan of magic and creativity, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.<br />David Royall and local, which is a nice change of pace from the threats to the entire world that inhabit so many other fantasy novels.

US	50332419	RWQ5YP35QE97U	0553379208	869489956	When Dragons Rage (The Dragoncrown War Cycle, Book 2)	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Is it just me, or is that dragon looking a bit annoyed	When Dragons Rage is a very enjoyably read, it does suffer from a few minor problems that take it out of the realm of \\"great\\" and into \\"good but flawed.\\" Unfortunately, its biggest flaw is almost unforgivable:  it's dreadfully boring at times.  And that's not like Stackpole.<br />It suffers from an acute case of middle-book syndrome.  It seems at times that the characters, introduced and developed in the first book, just move around the board in preparation for their final use in the last book of the series.  They go through some more development in this one, and they are for the most part interesting.  But I can't help feeling that this is a place-holder book rather than a continuation.  Even Stackpole seems to feel that way, as it lacks in large part his characteristic military action.  Oh, don't get me wrong.  It is there, and when it is, Stackpole excels as he usually does.  However, Stackpole goes on for long passages about things that aren't really that interesting.  He gives great gory detail about the magic system in this world, telling us the whys and wherefores of many of Kerrigan's spells as he works out exactly what his abilities are.  The spell descriptions get tedious after a while, and he spends pages on them.  Dullness is not a good thing when we're talking about an action book.<br />The characters are usually just as interesting as the first book, and Kerrigan actually gets less annoying (which I didn't think was possible).  In fact, when Stackpole isn't boring us with the explanation of how magic works, Kerrigan is actually a pretty interesting character as he comes under a new tutor who isn't all that he seems.  The revelation about this tutor actually comes as a shock.  Will continues his fine progress on the road to being a good man.  He's still naïve at times, but he's growing into a strong young man and it's not as unlikely as it was before that he would be the man to finally beat Chytrine.<br />Princess Alexia and Crow also remain interesting characters, but there are aspects that I found a little suspect, or at least unsupported and coming out of nowhere.  As part of a plan to help Crow get out of his mess, Alexia offers to marry him in order to make him a non-citizen of the Southlands and thus make him harder to try as a criminal.  But they develop a love for each other that makes them wish for the end of all this conflict so they can get on with their lives.  While I understand how a love can grow when you're in constant proximity to another person, there is no development of this other than a scene where Alexia thinks back to the their time together and realizes that she wants his touch.  We don't see any of this time, unfortunately.  It's all in Alexia's thoughts.  It wasn't a surprise that this happened, but it would have been nice to see some of it before Stackpole just presents it to us.<br />Even Chytrine is characterized in this book.  Not only that, but Stackpole gives her another dimension which makes her less a caricature.  Unfortunately, that other dimension is given by interacting with a \\"daughter\\" that she has taken earlier from the South.  The reason this is unfortunate is because Isaura is a very dull character.  She must have been introduced to set up her role in the third book.  I can't think of any other reason why Stackpole would include her.  She does do a couple of important things, but overall she's useless.  She's yet another innocent character who goes on and on about how innocent they are.  She has never seen the Southlands before, so Chytrine sends her on one of the expeditions to the South.  She observes, she does some things in the main city that don't really have much of an explanation, and then she goes home.  Innocent does not have to mean boring, but unfortunately Stackpole doesn't seem to realize that.  Kerrigan suffered from this in the first book.  There seems to be a quota of boring innocent characters in this series, and when one moves beyond it, another one musttake its place.<br />The plot of the book is pretty good overall, though as I said, there are long passages of tedium.  Crow's problem stretches on for the first 100 pages or so, and not all of them are needed.  There are long chapters of Kerrigan trying to work out spells.  Some of the other character exposition is interesting, though.  The ending, however, is magnificent and really does leave you longing for the last book so you can see how it ends.  We finally get to see some more information about the dragons in the world (instead of being a small plot device) and some startling events happen that take your breath away if you've been following these characters.  Most of the action takes place in the last half of the book (in fact, at times Adrogans' invasion seems like an attempt to get some action in the first part of the book, though I know his story is more important than that).  There are still plenty of heads flying and limbs being chopped off, but there is much less than previous books.<br />It's a shame, because Stackpole is a wonderful action writer.  He seems to be working on his characters, though, and I have to admit that he does a much better job overall with them.  While this is not a wonderful book, it does its work well.  Try to get through the boring parts for the meat at the end.  There are some things at the beginning to hold your interest as well, so take heart.  And get ready for a rollicking conclusion.  I'm sure it's coming.  Don't you dare disappoint me, Michael.<br />David Royt take its place.<br />The plot of the book is pretty good overall, though as I said, there are long passages of tedium.

US	50332419	R27UQ5IAIGI725	0142001805	89209679	The Eyre Affair: A Thursday Next Novel	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Personally, I'd go inside some Victorian Erotica	The Eyre Affair is a wonderful literary concoction.  Creating a world where literature is king, Fforde has a masterful sense of style and setting that I haven't seen equaled in a while.  It has everything from cloned dodos to time travelers to stories within a story.  Only a sense of illogic about the history of the world in which Fforde writes mars an otherwise excellent novel.<br />Fforde's imagination is breathtaking.  While the characters are fairly mundane (with the exception of Thursday herself and Acheron a bit), the world Fforde has created is extremely novel and interesting.  I'll deal with character first so I can get it out of the way.  Next is a wonderful protagonist, full of intriguing idiosyncrasies, a biting sense of humour, intelligence and street smarts.  The book is mostly told in first person from her point of view, though there are some passages that are in third person, almost as if they were told to her later.  This makes an effective mix as the reader gets to hear about events that happen away from Next, but almost the entire book is coloured with Next's unique interpretation of things.  Hades makes a really good villain, though he is a bit stereotypical.  Then again, I think that's the point, as Fforde writes him deliberately over the top.  He takes pride in his evilness, and even makes statements like \\"I haven't committed a despicable act in the last ten minutes!\\"  He does have a bit of a third dimension, but he operates more as a foil for Next then as a true character.  Thankfully, though, he doesn't suffer from \\"stupid villain\\" syndrome, where the villain is required to do something dumb in order to be defeated.  Instead, a bit of luck and some good observational skills on Next's part do him in.  He's a lot of fun, and the game that he plays with Next is entertaining to watch.<br />The rest of the characters are quirky but don't get a lot of detail added to them.  There's  Next's father, a rogue ChronoGuard who is roaming through the timelines.  There's Jack Schitt, the Goliath corporation man, who's as slimy as most corporation \\"villains\\" in books nowadays.  There's also some of Next's partners, who get just a little characterization, enough to make them at least two-dimensional instead of just one.  And, of course, there are the literary characters, such as Jane Eyre and her love, Edward Rochester, as well as Mr. Quaverly from Martin Chuzzlewit.  Fforde does a bit better with Rochester, who is more involved with the ending and helps Next out when she really needs it.<br />But as I said, this is not really a book about character.  This is a book about images, ideas, and style, and this is where Fforde excels.  He has truly come up with an interesting world to play in.  Literature is almost everything, and the arts are first and foremost (except for wars, of course).  Baconians go door to door to try and convince people that Francis Bacon wrote the plays the are credited to William Shakespeare.  Surrealists are condemned, but then later made legal.  When this happens, anti-Surrealists riot.  There are kiosks at the blimp stations (blimps are the main form of air travel in this world) that give you snippets of Shakespeare.  Next plays a five-minute snippet of Richard III while she's waiting for her flight.  Imagine a performance of Richard III that's performed every weekend for fifteen years, where the audience members are the actors and there is a form of audience participation very familiar to Rocky Horror Picture Show fans.<br />Most impressive of all, a machine is created that will allow people to enter a novel or a poem.  If this happens in the original manuscript and things are changed, the changes are reflected in every copy of the book in existence.  If it happens in just a copy, then other copies are unaffected.  You can interact with characters in the novel, and if those characters are not \\"on-screen\\" in the novel, you can do anything you want.  Since Jane Eyre is told in first person, Nexthas to avoid her when she's in the novel.  But she can interact with Rochester as much as she wants, as long as Rochester is not interacting with Jane. It's a fascinating concept and Fforde presents it all very well.<br />The world is different from ours in many other ways, too.  The Crimean War between Britain and Tsarist Russia has been going on for 150 years with no end in sight (though there have been negotiations).  It is implied that the French Revolution is fairly recent as well.  The only fault in this world, and it really is minor considering how illogical the world is anyway, is that some of the history doesn't fit together.  If the Crimean War is still going on and the French Revolution is recent, there is no way there should have been a big war with a Nazi Germany.  The conditions that created Nazi Germany would probably not have existed in this type of world.  Thankfully, this is just mentioned in passing before Fforde continues with his narrative.<br />I loved everything about this book, though.  I laughed at some of the absurdities (like the Baconians and the ongoing debate about Shakespeare's plays, which gets \\"solved\\" in a unique way that avoids treading on any of the real theories that are out there).  The characters are just good enough to drive the narrative forward and present this wonderful world that Fforde has created.  They do what they have to do.  Fforde's writing is marvelous and his use of language is really impressive.  When he writes scenes that take place in famous works of literature, they don't feel out of place.  He's succeeded in writing an extremely literary novel that doesn't necessarily take itself too seriously.  He has fun, and so will you.

I usually find these books to be page-turners, and this one is no exception.  Follett ratchets up the tension, sprinkles a couple of interesting characters into the batter, and then hits \\"blend.\\"  The result is a taut thriller that is very pleasing to the palate.<br />Follett presents a thriller that will make you keep reading, no matter the fact that the light should have been turned off long ago.  The plot twists and turns until it's almost pretzel-shaped, with Dieter getting ever closer to his goal.  In a way, it is almost reminiscent of The Dirty Dozen, except that the people in question aren't all criminals, their just misfits.  They are thrown together in a haphazard manner and expected to pull of a mission in enemy-occupied France.  While it is slightly unbelievable, Follett avoids the clich&eacute; of having everybody become crack secret agents once they are in France.  Mistakes happen, stupid things are done, and Flick ends up having to improvise mightily.  I found this a major plus, because you didn't always know what was going to happen, even if the ultimate outcome wasn't always in doubt.<br />Follett concentrates on three characters: Flick, Dieter, and an American officer named Paul Chancellor, who becomes romantically interested in Flick.  This provides a good narrative force for the story, as the viewpoints are limited and we see a lot of the other characters only through these three pairs of eyes.  I think it made it more interesting, and it also emphasized the personal nature of the story as Dieter and Flick interact even when they're not together.  In fact, while I found Paul interesting in his own right, I think the story would have worked better without him, or at least without his viewpoint.  It would have narrowed the focus even further, and made the inevitable meeting all the richer.<br />Flick is a very dynamic character, well-rounded and interesting to read about.  She's torn because she's constantly away from her husband, and she doesn't trust him with the other resistance fighters.  He's always been a lady's man.  She's also brutally efficient when necessary and she's quick on her feet.  I really liked her, and I thought she made a wonderful protagonist.  Paul makes a good foil for her, despite what I said above.  I did find the sections from his point of view to be kind of dull, though.  He doesn't add much to the mix that he couldn't have added as a minor character.<br />Dieter, on the other hand, is fascinating.  He's certainly the villain of the book.  He's a Nazi officer through and through.  But he's humanized as well.  He finds that he's falling in love with his French mistress and he truly seems to care for her.  He doesn't know what is going to happen after this invasion, but he ultimately decides that he wants to be with her afterward.  On the other hand, he's capable of being brutal (though Follett provides a character in Sergeant Baker, who's just a sadist, as a counterpoint to Dieter).  He doesn't like torture despite being good at it, and he even remarks that this makes the best interrogator.  If the interrogator enjoys the pain too much, he loses sight of the goal and won't be very efficient.  I found him very interesting to read about, despite not liking him in the least.  He made the perfect villain, and his fate is actually a little surprising.<br />Follett falls a little short in the other characters, though, especially the women.  The other Germans are rather faceless, but that's their job in the story: to be the strongmen for Dieter to use.  But the women, I think, should be more important than they turn out to be.  They get a lot of characterization as Flick recruits and trains them, but once they drop into France, they become almost invisible.  The only one who gets much characterization is Ruby, and that's because she's effectively Flick's second in command.  The others get short shrift, and it's too bad.  They appeared to be interesting characters at the beginning.  I'm not saying they should be viewpoint characters, but more should have been done with them than actually happened.  They fulfill their roles, but they aren't very interesting doing it.<br />There are some choppy places in the book where Follett's prose and plotting fails him too.  At times, Follett over-writes, emphasizing things that don't need to be.  He makes a point of saying that only two characters in a scene know something, and then he says it again during the conversation with the other people in the scene.  It was distracting.  Also, there is one point where Flick and her party shoot two guards, but when Dieter comes upon them, one of them is still alive enough to gasp out what happened.  Flick has been shown to be cautious to the point of paranoia and efficient to the point that she never leaves anything done half way.  Yet she doesn't slit this guard's throat to make sure he's dead?  I didn't buy it.  It seemed like the guard was only alive so Dieter could find out what he wanted to know.  It smacked of author intervention.  Niggling things like this are spread throughout the book, never actually killing it but always sitting in the back of your mind.<br />Despite these flaws, however, I found I could not put this book down.  I raced through it because I wanted to see what would happen next.  It is a great example of the genre and an exciting read.  If you like this sort of story, you should pick it up.<br />Warning for the squeamish: there are a couple of torture scenes that you may find unsettling, especially the first one.<br />David Roynd it's too bad.

US	50332419	R1OMI833P45EUL	0765301180	914292058	Lancelot Du Lethe (Mad Merlin)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	The moon sets on a great knight	Lancelot du Lethe is the second book featuring King's unique take on the Arthurian legends.  Gone are the various pantheons of gods, as this book is mostly about the land of Britain itself, its ties with the Fey folk, and how Christianity is pushing everything aside.  King plays with the legends even as he includes many things that we all know and love about them.  This is a better book than the first and it doesn't contain any of the problems the first book had.  It does, however, have a couple of its own.<br />As good as Mad Merlin was, this book is just so much richer that it's hard to believe.  Anybody familiar with the Arthurian legends knows of the ill-fated love between Guinevere and Lancelot, and how the betrayal of Arthur affects Camelot and everything around it.  While sticking to the basics of the legend, King adds so much more to the tapestry that it reads like a new tale.  While Mad Merlin added the war between the gods, Lancelot du Lethe adds a great deal of detail to the land of the Fey, and the magical world that lies beneath and between the real world of man.  Guinevere is of this land, and while she is married to Arthur in order to bring peace and stability to the land, she is drawn to Lancelot and his otherworldness.  He harbours a secret of his own and draws her to him even more, a secret that even he doesn't know about.  They are fated to be lovers as well, and this adds the main conflict to the story.  The choices that King has the characters make are hard choices, and there are always consequences to them.  He doesn't give them an easy way out like some authors do.<br />Guinevere is much more developed in this book than the last one.  It was about Arthur and Merlin, and Guinevere was mainly a means to an end, a character that served a purpose and wasn't a whole lot more. Here, though, she comes into her own.  She is a kind and good queen, but she is a woman who is living in a sexless marriage because if she gives in to Arthur, everything will be destroyed.  When Lancelot shows up, she is inexplicably drawn to him.  Their romance is tragic, even more tragic than in many tellings of the legends.  Lancelot is a good man as well, and he knows what he feels will hurt Arthur.  He continues to try and deny his feelings but he feels like he must follow his heart.  King masterfully tells the story of how they dance around each other and their feelings, and Arthur's feelings as well, until ultimately something has to give.  These are all good people, and the reader feels the tragedy even more because of that.<br />Other characters are not so well drawn, as they interact with these three only peripherally.  I sometimes questioned the choices King made in this.  Morgan le Fay and her son Mordred don't really come across very well.  Morgan has plans for Lancelot but these plans are foiled more out of authorial fiat than by anything Lancelot actually does.  She does have a hand in the tragic ending, much like in the legends, but she plays a relatively minor role overall.  This is a shame because she's in the book a lot, and always lurking in the background and behind Mordred's plans as well.  Mordred also doesn't come across as very interesting, and if King wasn't keeping to the basics of the legend, I would have liked to have seen a more interesting villain.  As it is, his character is given more weight by his place in the stories that King is using than by King himself.  And Merlin only makes a couple of token appearances.  His first appearance is superfluous, however, and his second only provides a story element before he goes back to his wonderful life with his lady love.  I think it would have been a better book either without him, or with a meatier part to the story.<br />Again, King does a wonderful job with the tools he is given and extrapolates very well, giving the story a fresh feel even as we know the basics of what is going to happen.  The prose is again wonderful, with rich descriptions and vivid scenes.The interesting thing is how he extends the tales, and King delivers in spades.  Sure, there are familiar items: other knights (Galahad, Gawain), the Holy Grail and the Spear of Longinus).  However, the rich descriptions of the fairy world, the way King uses the fairies to supplement the intrigue in the real world, and the tragic elements King adds to the romance, all do their jobs nicely.  Even when you know what's going to happen, you really don't.  That's the perfect way to retell a legend.<br />There is another minor problem with the book, however.  This is the almost anecdotal feel to the book.  It almost seems like a set of stories with an overarching theme, almost like a \\"Stories of King Arthur and the Round Table\\" with stories that mainly center on Lancelot.  While this may give it a feel of the old legends, I found it kind of distracting in a 450 page book that's not really a short story book.  This problem is alleviated later on once events start rolling down the hill to their inevitable oblivion.  But at first, it is a problem.<br />I will say that the ending is very fitting, though.  King really outdoes his first book there.  It's tragic yet it also has a glimmer of hope.  It also provides the perfect bookend with the first book.  Together, they make a wonderful visit to the land of Arthur, taking you back to the old days of jousts, chivalry, warriors in plate armour, and romance.

Sometimes, it seems like Arthurian pastiches are a dime a dozen.  But King does a wonderful job of mixing the legends with other mythologies, creating a taut tale of magic, intrigue, violence and royalty that will take your breath away.<br />Books based on the Arthur legends can be predictable, and in a sense this isn't any different.  However, King throws so many interesting side elements into the mix that the reader is constantly wondering what's going to come next.  He has created, in Mad Merlin, a very interesting character that you want to read about.  Not only is he destined to aid Arthur in his quest, but through Arthur he will come to know his own mind.  He is truly mad at the beginning of the book, and it is only through his actions and his time with Arthur that he slowly becomes aware of who and what he is.  What is his relation to Excalibur?  What is the source of his power?  As the book goes on, you find out more and more and the story never lets you go.  I'm not going to reveal Merlin's secret, but it just adds another intriguing layer to an already interesting character.<br />The side elements are the flavoring for the Arthurian myths, and they make the book a great read.  King throws in the Roman pantheon of gods, the Norse gods, the land of the fey (fairies, pixies, nayads, and many other mystical creatures) and tells a tale not just of personal destiny (in the case of King Arthur) but also of religious destiny.  The war is not just between men, but between gods.  There are a lot of Christian images that will infringe on the other pantheons if they don't fight back.  Christ himself is not portrayed in any way, but the Christian mythos is portrayed as an overwhelming force that will wipe out anything that stands in its path.<br />I liked how this book moved beyond the typical Arthurian legends, even as it rewrote them.  All of the main elements are there: Merlin, Guinevere, Excalibur, the Lady of the Lake (though she's called something different in this one), Camelot, and the Round Table.  Lancelot doesn't show up until the next book, though (one which I will also review shortly).  Even the origins of Morgan Le Fay and Arthur's son Mordred are detailed, probably in much the same way as the legends go, though the details surrounding these events are different.  There's even the act of Arthur removing the sword from the stone, though the circumstances are very different, and it even becomes a bad thing that he does it when he does.  This impulsive mistake drives the action for the rest of the book, and adds an interesting element to the mix.<br />The language and the prose King uses are magnificent.  It took me forever to read this book (and the next one), and I thought it was because of the mood I was in.  But I'm reading another, lighter book now, and I'm breezing through it.  Looking back on this book, I realize that it's the beauty of the imagery and description that kept me going so slowly.  King really knows how to tell a story.  When the battles rage, you're right there with blood flowing, heads being caved in and swords finding their way into the seams of plate mail armour.  The good times, the festive and romantic times are also well told.  At times King gets a bit excessive with the description, but it's so beautiful (or chilling, depending on what is happening), that you normally don't notice.  You just notice that you haven't moved very far into the book.<br />There is one strange thing about this book, however.  It feels like it's two separate books combined into one.  There's no hint that this is true, and books are divided into \\"Books 1 and 2\\" quite often.  However, the second book begins with a bunch of description of the previous events, a recap of sorts, that isn't really needed considering the events in question happened just a few pages ago.  It's almost like the second book was supposed to be published separately (orit was published without any indication in this book of this fact).  I found it quite distracting, but thankfully that only lasted until I got into the second book.  It was quickly gone again.<br />A couple of other minor problems mar what would otherwise be a marvelous book, both having to do with the ending.  The final battle just drags on a little too long, and then the sequence with Loki in the land of the Saxon gods, while entertaining at times, seems a bit useless.  I realize that Loki's exploits have a lot to do with Excalibur so they are important to the story, but the writing of these events just makes them feel extraneous.  It's the only place where the writing fails a little, and it makes the final sequence more of a chore to get through than it should be.  This combined with the seemingly never-ending final battle makes for a dull thud of an ending.<br />All in all, though, this is a great King Arthur book.  I picked it up on a whim, and I'm glad I did.  What a marvelous mixture of everything.  You think you know King Arthur?  Think again.  Then read this book, and its sequel.  You'll be glad you did.<br />David Roy(or it was published without any indication in this book of this fact).

It's a very effective book that shows the true power of stories in the world.  On the Disc, stories have a power of their own and reality changes itself to conform to the grooves etched out by a story.  The story is a living, breathing entity and modifies the people involved in it.  It's also a darn funny book, though not quite up with the rest of the Discworld books in that regard.<br />Witches Abroad takes our witches and puts them in a bunch of new situations, letting us learn more and more about them.  Thankfully, the situations are also hilariously funny, made even funnier by Granny's reaction to them.  She bulls forward without stopping, demanding that the world conform to her demands instead of the other way around.  So what if they do things different in another land?  They'd better just start doing things her way while she's there.  It was a real treat, and really demonstrated how fun these characters can be.<br />Of course, Granny gets the most character development, as events in the book start to take on a more personal note.  She's actually afraid, which is a first, and it's slightly unsettling to see her like that.  But she doesn't lose any of her charm as she intimidates some dwarfs, grouses that Magrat is running around in pants(!) and generally remains her crotchety self.  She is probably the funniest character in the book because of all this.  There is a priceless scene on a riverboat where she works to retrieve the money Nanny lost gambling with some card sharks.  It's simply wonderful to behold as she shows how, even though she may not understand the customs of foreign parts, she has a street-level knowledge that no one is a match for.  It's probably my favourite scene in the book.<br />Nanny is also very well done, especially when she shows off her knowledge of all these foreign countries (even if a lot of it is wrong).  She's the most experienced of the witches in the game of life, as she's been around the block or two.  I was familiar with Casanunda, the world's second greatest lover, from a subsequent Witches book that I read first.  This is the book where Nanny meets him, and she's the only character that he could interact with and be at all funny.  She \\"knows the ways of the world,\\" so to speak, and thus finds his advances touching and amusing.  She's also the only person who understands Granny and can keep any sort of leash on her.  Thus, she plays an important part by being Granny's sounding board and confidante.  Her letters home to her son are great fun as well, especially when she says that they ordered \\"steak tartar\\" and everybody looked at her funny when she said she wanted it well-done.<br />The other characters are pretty good, too, if unremarkable.  Magrat continues to be the \\"straight man\\" to all of the fun, and she constantly gets into fights with Granny over what they're going to do.  Having read Lords &amp; Ladies (the next book in the Witches series) already, I saw the beginnings of what was to happen there.  I don't know if it meant more because of that or not, but it did make it interesting.  Unfortunately, other than that, she's not that intriguing. I did like the trouble she was having with her new power, and how it took on a distinctly Halloweenish tinge.  The other minor characters have their moments and are amusing, but they're not really anything special.<br />The story moves along at a brisk pace, and is fairly short (about 285 pages).  For awhile, I was beginning to wonder if they would ever get to Genua, or if this would be more of a travelogue.  There are many humorous stories that take place on their trip, from the Dwarven mountain to the riverboat and to a castle full of sleeping people.  Many fairy tales are parodied here, and even more are parodied by Nanny or Granny talking about them.  There are too many to mention here, though, andhalf the fun is seeing how Pratchett twists them to meet his own needs.  The book does begin to drag a little bit during their travels, however, and is only lightened up again when they stumble upon another fairy tale being acted out.  There were times I wished he'd just move on and do something else, and then he finally did and everything was all right.  I also really loved the mirror motif throughout the story, and how mirrors can amplify magical power, especially if you stand between them and let them reflect back and forth.  I thought this was nicely done and original.<br />This is a very satisfying addition to the Discworld mythos, and it's also a quick and easy read.  You will laugh a lot during it, so read it if you need a pick-me-up.  Pratchett does it again, and I can't wait to read the rest of his books that I haven't yet.  The Witches have quickly grown into my favourite cast of Discworld characters, and it was good to read another of their adventures.  This book is fine to read by itself as an introduction to the Witches, but it's even better if you read Wyrd Sisters first.<br />David Royhalf the fun is seeing how Pratchett twists them to meet his own needs.

Agents of Chaos I: Hero's Trial is the fourth book in the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order series. The series so far has been dazzling, but unfortunately there always has to be a bump in the road. This one's it. Michael Stackpole provided a lot of momentum with his two book series, but Luceno drops the ball a little bit. It's not that bad, by any means. It's just not that good.<br />I've been anxiously awaiting Han Solo's story ever since what happened to Chewie. In Stackpole's series, Han was sidelined as somebody who was wallowing in his sorrows and going off to get drunk. He was gaining weight and basically becoming a slob who didn't care about anything. But we knew he wouldn't be like this forever. When I heard that Hero's Trial was about him, I rejoiced.<br />Then I read it, and I wasn't quite so happy. I'm not sure if it just suffers in comparison to Stackpole's, or if it has its own problems. First of all, while there are the requisite space battles that any Star Wars book or movie has to have, the scenes just fall flat here. The dialogue's not bad, but the descriptions of the battles just lie there, moribund. They don't bring that sense of exhilaration that previous ones did. Sure, all the terminology's there: the jukes, the jinks, the firing of lasers and proton torpedoes. However, the sense of the ebb and flow just isn't there. I wouldn't say I was necessarily bored, but they definitely didn't hum.<br />The second problem with the book is the other characters. They are, almost to a man (or woman), dreadfully dull. Luceno creates a few Yuuzhan Vong characters, but they just lie there on the page. The scenes on the Vong ships are flat and just basically exposition. The Vong plan is to \\"allow\\" a defector to join up with the Alliance, but when she meets the Jedi Knights, a surprise will be awaiting them. This is not a spoiler as the plan is detailed by the Vong in the first few chapters. Thus, any sense of suspense is lost because we know what they are trying to do. The only suspense is whether it works or not. This isn't always a bad thing, but this causes the Vong characters to be nothing but mouthpieces as any scene with them devolves into \\"make it look like you're trying to rescue her, but make sure you don't.\\"<br />None of the other characters inspire much in the reader either. The lone exception to that is Droma, the Ryn that Han meets up with on Ord Mantell. Droma has a lot of snappy dialogue and he makes the perfect foil for Han. He becomes a temporary partner to Han, and the interplay between the two is a wonder to behold. Droma is sarcastic, philosophical, slightly a coward but he's also willing to make the extra sacrifice when necessary, even with his tail (which we see in a truly memorable scene where it's instrumental in rescuing Han). He is a wonderful creation, and I hope we see more of him.<br />Another major problem with this book is the coincidences. The Star Wars universe is full of coincidences, and usually I can look past them. If two stories are going on, it's very likely that they'll both end up in the same place eventually. That's all well and good. But in this case, three stories all end up in the same place, and it just stretches my suspension of disbelief almost to the breaking point. On top of that is when Han ends up on the same passenger ship on which the defector is being transported. I'm willing to grant a little bit of leeway on this usually, but this book was just too much.<br />One thing I did like, however, was the way the story showed two sides of the same faction (in this case, the Vong and their associates) not know what the other one is doing. Some Vong associates actually believe the defector is real, and they try to capture her, throwing a wrench into everything. It's the sort of incompetence that happens in real life, when the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing, and it was nice to see here. It adds a bit of chaos to everything and was a nice feature.<br />From a seriespoint of view, I am a bit disheartened, though. Monumental events happened in the last book. While some of them are referred to (the planet Ithor, for example), one of the major events is never mentioned at all: the fall of Corran Horn. While this did happen a couple of months ago in the Star Wars timeline, it still should be fresh in everybody's minds. But he doesn't get a mention at all. It brings up something I was afraid would happen, and I hope it doesn't become a chronic problem. Are the authors only going to use their own characters in their own books? I seriously hope not. I don't want Horn sidelined for too long. He's too interesting of a character.<br />I think I liked this book more than it sounds because I was anxious for some Han Solo action. It's nice to see him again, and it was nice to see him be his old roguish self. I love the quirky grin, the \\"who, me?\\" attitude and his ability to get himself into the worst situations and then fly out of them unscathed. This is the Han Solo that I loved seeing in the old movies and I missed him. He's a man who isn't used to responsibilities, except to himself. He's been living a responsible life for 25 years now, and it's beginning to wear on him. It was good to see you in action, Han. Too bad the book around you couldn't have been better.<br />David Royseries point of view, I am a bit disheartened, though. Monumental events happened in the last book.

While the first book of this series within a series was a bump in the road to success, the second book redeems it slightly. But only slightly. It starts off slowly and still has some of Luceno's previous book's problems, but overall it is an improvement. Hopefully, the entire series is back on the upswing.<br />Luceno crams a lot of story into the 348 pages of this book. Sometimes it seems to be bursting at the seams, with bits of story leaking from the holes. Some of the stories seem to get short shrift, like the Skidder story. This does play an important part in the finale, so it has to be in there, but I think Luceno could have spent a little more time on it, or found some other way for what happens to evolve. Actually, what I think could have been left on the cutting room floor, with more stuff added to other stories, is the in-depth scenes with the various refugee Ryn. A lot of time is spent on them and with not a lot of discernible effect. Sure, Luceno uses them to illustrate the greediness of the people trying to handle the refugees, and the ship on which they eventually end up plays a semi-important part in the finale, but I think too much time is spent on them.<br />There is another reason I think too much time is spent on them, though. I thought the characterization of them was very lazy. The Ryn are just stereotypical gypsies, and the numbers aren't even filed off. They are people who roam the galaxy, always suspected and persecuted, who dance a lot and play games. They are fortune-tellers who like to use cards in their telling. Droma, because he is characterized a lot more deeply by being partners with Han Solo, breaks out of this stereotype, though the elements are still there. He is actually made an interesting character. But his family and relatives who show up in this book don't do anything but act like gypsies. It would have been nice if they were at least slightly different. And since Luceno doesn't even make them very interesting people as characters, the scenes with them are slow and boring.<br />Another problem with the book is the very slow beginning. I really struggled to get through the first 100 pages or so. There are also various slow spots throughout the rest of the novel as well. This usually happens when Luceno decides to go into great, gory detail about previous books. When I say previous books, I'm not talking about previous New Jedi Order books either. There are so many references to previous series and books that I found it very distracting. Unlike Luceno's last book, where these references also were but he handled them a lot better and I didn't see them as worth mentioning in my review, this time it gets distracting. Luceno sometimes spends whole paragraphs explaining what happened in the previous books, making the story skid to a halt. The worst example of this is when Jacen and Anakin are brought in to prime the secret weapon in the Corellian system. A few years ago this weapon was the centerpiece in a potential rebellion of the Corellian system against the New Republic. Luceno describes almost everything about these books, and it really drags the story down with it when he does.<br />While most of the stories do a decent job of holding the reader's interest (except for the refugees, as explained above), the only really interesting story is the Han and Droma story. The book just kind of sits there when they aren't on the screen, and the book does suffer from it. Han and Droma play off each other very well as characters, and the interplay between them is wonderful. Luceno does a great job of making Droma slide right in as Han's partner, with only a few pangs at Chewbacca's absence. The events that happen to them are interesting as well. Han's daring rescue of Droma when Droma's been arrested on Ruan is a lot of fun, and the droid character that helps Han helps make the story even more fun. The action is non-stop, and vividly described by Luceno, and I have to applaud him for it. This story is wonderful.<br />While the other stories do just kind of sit there, I have to give Luceno credit for tying everything together. The climax is breath-taking, and makes up for the entire rest of the book. Unlike the previous book, there are valid explanations for why everybody ends up at the same place and I didn't find myself groaning once at the coincidence. Luceno still doesn't describe the space battle sequences very well, in my opinion, but he does do a better job than the previous book. There is a lot of tension in the action and it definitely held my interest. I think part of the success is because Luceno doesn't have to describe a lot of ship-to-ship action (though there is some). Instead, most of the ship-to-ship action is the Millenium Falcon and her adversaries. Luceno seems to be better at personal action, with the fight scenes in Han's rescue of Droma and in Kyp and Ganar's attempted rescue of Wurth being especially done well.<br />This book started out so slowly that I was convinced I would give it a worse rating than Hero's Trial, but it surprised me. It got a lot better, and while most of the stories didn't completely excite me, they held my interest while I was waiting for more Han Solo action. That's not bad. I have to say that Luceno did much better this time around, though I'm still not particularly happy that he's the author chosen to end the entire series.

This book was definitely worth the wait to read. I've never seen Stackpole be so good with characters, but he does a wonderful job here. Everybody's in character and they seem to grow along with the story. We don't exactly learn anything new about them, but they do new things and progress is made in some of their individual stories.<br />The main character, as is usual in a Stackpole Star Wars book, is Corran Horn. He seems to be Stackpole's favourite, especially since he created Horn. Horn is a Jedi who is torn between Luke Skywalker's way (a more benign, defensive posture for the Jedi) and Kyp Durron's way (take the war to the enemy, be on the offensive and solve conflicts before they start). In the previous book, one of Kyp's disciples, Ganner Rhysode, saved Horn because he acted on his belief, and it gives Horn a little pause to think. However, one thing I liked about this book is that Ganner actually learns something as well. Using Horn and Ganner (who both are on the reconnaissance mission) as two polar opposites, Stackpole presents the two sides of the Jedi debate without really coming down on one side or the other. Not only does Corran move a little toward Ganner's side, but events force Ganner to re-evaluate his beliefs as well.<br />Elsewhere on the character front, Stackpole brings back some old friends. It seems to be old home week as the New Republic goes to the remnants of the old Imperial Navy for help in fighting the Vong. A familiar character if you've read the previous books from Bantam, Admiral Pellaeon shows up and becomes a force to be reckoned with as well. It was nice to see him again, as he was one of my favourite Imperials when I was reading the old books. He fits like an old glove, with his wonderful combination of thoughtfulness, intelligence, and the occasional wry comment.<br />The rest of the characters are well done, too. They just aren't as remarkable as the job Stackpole does on the above-mentioned ones. Our heroes from the movies fulfill their roles admirably, with Luke continuing his personal growth as the leader of the Jedi and Leia once against sacrificing herself, her time and her energy in helping the downtrodden. In this case, that amounts to the refugees from the Vong conquest of the Outer Rim worlds. Her children acquit themselves admirably, with daughter Jaina an ace pilot and sons Jacen and Anakin filling out their Jedi roles. Anakin is the naïve youngster who brazenly disobeys orders when he's talked into it by a smooth-talking associate. The only one missing is Han, who only appears a couple of times, still brooding about events in a previous book. He disappears quickly, and it's a shame. The good thing is that the next two books feature him heavily, so you just have to bide your time.<br />Stackpole handles the transition from character to action like only Stackpole can. He is probably the best action writer I've read. His space battles are so dynamic that you can visualize them with special effects from the movies. The prose and dialogue are so smooth, you feel like you're in a Rogue Squadron cockpit. You feel the tension as the Vong ships are flying around and devastating the ships above the planet. He also writes personal action very well, with lightsaber fights that are vividly described (sometimes too vividly, though while there is some blood and troopers cleaved in half, Stackpole doesn't dwell on the descriptions too much). Again, it almost feels like it's all appearing on screen. That may not always be a good thing in a book, but considering Star Wars started out as a movie franchise, I find it very pleasing in this series.<br />Finally, the plot holds your interest. You actually get some viewpoints from the Vong side of things, which is a definite plus. They don't appear as faceless enemies any more, and Stackpole uses these viewpoints to cover over some of the differences that appeared in them from the first book to the second book. He fleshes them out to a great extent, with warrior castes, religious castes, and others. This makes the final confrontation even more understandable, and the result of it, while predictable to an extent, is still stunning in a way. Not so much because you don't see it coming, but because of the way Stackpole describes it. The ending truly makes you wonder what's going to happen next in the series, as even when the good guys win, they've so far always lost to a certain extent. This bodes well for the series as it's just starting to pick up steam (3 books in to a 19 book series).<br />While this book would certainly be understandable to somebody who picks it up without reading the first two books, it should really be read only after reading them. At least pick up the first one of this duology, (Dark Tide I: Onslaught) beforehand.

Section 31: Abyss is a novel by David Weddle and Jeffrey Lang.  Weddle helped write the DS9 episode \\"Inquisition,\\" which introduced Section 31. I haven't read the other books in this series, so I don't know if they are connected in any way except by theme, but I do know that this novel is outstanding.  Is it because Weddle was involved with the creation of Section 31?  Who knows?  Whatever it is, it's the perfect combination of the old and the new that I love in a good Trek novel.<br />This is the Trek novel I've been waiting for.  It has wonderful character examinations, a very interesting plot, and best of all, consequences.  The Deep Space Nine novels take place after the end of the television series, so things can happen to the characters.  You don't necessarily know if everything is going to turn out all right.  And even when they do, characters can be irreversibly changed by the events in them.  Weddle and Lang have crafted together what I would call a masterpiece of Trek novels.<br />One major thing I have to mention right off the bat is the use of continuity.  If you're familiar with my Trek novel reviews, you know that heavy continuity references are not my favourite thing.  So many times, a book has been weighted down with reference after reference, with the explanations of these references taking up way too much room and killing the pace of the book.  This time, though, we are completely spared that problem. To my recollection, there is not one continuity reference in this book that slows the pace of the book.  Usually, if a reference is made, it's just left there.  If you are familiar with the events in question, then you understand it totally.  If you're not, then there is just enough information so that you get the feel for what the reference means in the scheme of this plot. I almost screamed in joy when I read my first reference.<br />This book is mainly a character study of Bashir, and as such it works wonders.  Bashir has always been one of the more interesting characters on the show, and I found this analysis of his character very interesting.  He's always been on the outside looking in, especially once his enhancement became public and people looked at him differently.  None of that seemed to happen in the series itself, but you can understand that people would start treating him differently and that he would start to resent it.  In this book, that resentment explodes as Locken tries to convince Bashir that they should work together for the betterment of the entire Federation.  They are almost perfect people.  Why shouldn't they try to shape the galaxy into what they think is best?  But the key word is \\"almost,\\" and that word becomes very important as Locken starts to go increasingly insane.  You do start to wonder, however, whether Bashir will come to his senses in time, and the suspense is palpable.<br />Dax makes a good sounding board for Bashir in the book, but she also has other things to do that have to do with the series as a whole.  Dax is still coming into her own as she is getting used to having the symbiote inside her.  She is a Trill, and she is just getting used to being able to access the memories and, at times, skills of her predecessors.  She learns some more in this novel, and it's the continuation of character development for her that I'm sure will continue in subsequent novels.  It's part of what brings the series closer together, but casual readers who pick up this book will not be mystified by what is going on with her.<br />The other characters are good as well.  Ro and Taran'atar have a lot to do as they try to get access to the base where Bashir and Dax are being held captive.  They get some solid character development as well.  The characters back at the station get less, and they probably could have been left out of the book entirely, except at the beginning.  There is some development that, again, is geared more toward future books.  Commander Vaughn, the new first officer of thestation, gets some more mystery added on to his past.  I find him an interesting character but I wish they would finally do something with him.  I think that in the next series of books he does get some character development, so the little teases in this book do their job well.  We'll have to see if it continues.<br />The plot is very tension-filled, with some action in the parts with Ro and Taran'atar, and a lot of philosophical discussion in the parts with Bashir and Locken.  Weddle and Lang to a wonderful job of juggling the two plot lines, always leaving one at an interesting turning point when they go to the other.  As I said above, though, I could have done without the side-trips to the station.  But they weren't too bad and I find those characters interesting, so I didn't mind too much.  If you're not a Trek fan, these side-trips might be more annoying.  The dialogue between Bashir and Locken is outstanding, with both sides doing their utmost to convince the other of the rightness of his position.  Dax is suitably skeptical of Locken's, and the tension in the room is palpable.<br />This novel is a must-have if you're a DS9 fan.  Section 31 is an interesting concept, and you're always wondering about ulterior motives.  I haven't read the other Section 31 books, so I don't know if there is an over-arching plot.  I do know that this book sits by itself very well.  If you like DS9, you owe it to yourself to follow the series of post-television novels.  If you don't feel like doing that, you still must check this one out.  It's a keeper.<br />David Roye station, gets some more mystery added on to his past.

US	50332419	R3MFZ6EZWWP8N	074322325X	572809024	The End of the Beginning: From the Siege of Malta to the Allied Victory at El Alamein	Books	3	7	8	N	N	1942: The Turning Point of the War	The End of the Beginning covers World War II on the western European front from May 25 to November 10, 1942.  It's written in almost novel form as it follows certain real people in the various theaters of the war, so it's not as dry as some history books can be.  However, the effect of the writing is diluted by some of the varying topics the book covers, lessening the impact and bringing down the quality of the book.<br />Clayton and Craig have an easy-going style that draws the reader into it.  The \\"characters\\" in the book come from all walks of life, from the British aristocracy to a nurse on the island of Malta to Winston Churchill himself.  The authors spent a lot of time interviewing many of their subjects, while other parts of the narrative are taken from war diaries and previous interviews that had been conducted.  They weave all of this into a wonderful tapestry that's sure to garner interest.<br />The chapters are set up to cover a certain number of days each.  Some are only one day, while others span a week or two.  Inside each chapter, many different events are covered during 1942.  The narrative jumps back and forth among these events, allowing us to get to know the people involved, the horrors that they faced and the bravery that they exhibited.  Sometimes, such as in the case of Mimi Cortis, a nurse on Malta, it was the bravery of just surviving day to day.  All of the stories are interesting and make you want to read more about them.<br />A number of the chapters have a theme that uses two events that contrast with each other to make a point.  In one chapter, the authors contrast a bombing mission over Germany that results in the pilot being captured and interred in a POW camp with a Jewish woman who is arrested on the island of Guernsey and her trip on train after train until she finally arrives at Auschwitz.  This chapter also puts together the deportation of the Jews from occupied territories, and the treatment that they had to endure, with the British bombing of civilians in Germany.  It's a very powerful chapter as we see man's inhumanity toward man demonstrated.  Yet we also see the apparent necessity of one of these against the barbarity of the other.<br />Another strong contrast is the chapters talking about Churchill's visit to Stalin to try and convince him that a second front (namely, an invasion of France) was not possible in 1942.  Stalin questioned the bravery of British troops because of this and they had many heated discussions.  Also in this chapter, though, is the story of a convoy that attempts to get supplies to Malta.  The convoy is bombed, stalked by U-Boats, and attacked by some surface ships.  Many cargo ships go down, but one of them refuses to sink.  The crew, along with rescued crewmembers from other ships, desperately work to keep the ship afloat and get it to Malta.  They finally succeed.  The scene in this chapter constantly switches back and forth between these two events, effectively putting the lie to Stalin's statements about British bravery.<br />There are some real problems with this book that bring it down considerably, though.  The first is the scattered nature of the narrative.  While all of the events and characters are interesting to read about, the scattershot approach makes for a very disjointed read.  The scene jumps from Egypt to Malta to England to Germany, back to England and then back to the Middle East.  Just as you are getting used to one event, it's on to something else.  While I never lost interest in the book, it did become a bit annoying.<br />The second problem is related to this in a way.  Some events are given short shrift because of this approach.  The battles in Egypt and Libya are given lots of time.  Malta has its fair share, too.  Life around a bomber base is detailed pretty nicely as well.  But other areas, while mentioned, are neglected to the point that I have to conclude the only reason they were included was for completeness' sake.  The raid on Dieppe, for example, is over in a few pages.  The main character that the authors use to discuss Dieppe is an American Ranger who was in the more successful aspect of this operation.  Most of the mistakes and catastrophic results of the main raid are told in hindsight and don't get that many pages.  Of 4963 Canadians who landed on the beaches, 3369 were killed, captured, or wounded.  But it only gets a few pages.<br />The other aspect that gets so little discussion that it's a wonder it was included is the political wrangling between the Americans and British.  Clayton and Craig talk about how the Lend Lease, where military equipment was \\"lent\\" to the British on the promise that they would pay when they were able to, was partially designed to keep Britain economically dependent on the United States so that the British Empire would fall and Britain would lose its world dominance after the war.  This is a potentially explosive issue, screaming for analysis.  But it gets only a few pages and is never discussed in great detail.<br />One would not be wrong to think this book is mostly about the battles in the Middle East.  While other subjects are covered, that gets the majority of the spotlight.  Sometimes I wished that they had just stayed there and covered that in even more detail and left the other insights to other books.  As good as this book is, it would have been so much better with a little bit of concentration.  As it is, I can't give it four stars.  But I would give it 3.75 if I could.<br />David Royieppe, for example, is over in a few pages.

US	50332419	R3HRASJ5058G80	0345428544	573865480	Dark Tide I: Onslaught (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 2)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Yuuzhan Vong Tide Just Keeps Rolling	Dark Tide I: Onslaught, is the second book in the New Jedi Order series of Star Wars books.  While Vector Prime was almost a non-stop action-fest, Stackpole chooses to examine the characters a little more closely.  It's a good choice because Stackpole does such a wonderful job of it.  Both books are good, just different.  It's a good sign for the series, too, as too much of the same thing would get boring really fast.<br />This novel is packed full and it's only 290 pages, yet it doesn't really feel like it's too much.  Stackpole does a good job of juggling various storylines, though it does get easier when most of them come together.  It does help that this is mostly a character novel, though, as he's able to get into the heads of the various characters and discover what makes them tick and how they all react to this new threat.  One way he's able to jam so much into this is because he completely ignores the Vong side of things until the very last chapter, which leads into the next book.  In Vector Prime, a large part of the story was told from the Vong point of view, as we learned more about their culture and society.  This time, though, we only see the Vong through the eyes of the main characters.<br />This is actually quite effective, as it turns them into an almost unstoppable force that we don't understand, the \\"dark tide\\" of the title.  The various investigations that the main characters are on provide them with insights to the Vong, and we follow along for the ride.  The Vong seem unusually cruel in this one, seemingly creating pain for pain's sake in their prisoners, torturing slaves when they become useless.  Since Stackpole wrote the next book as well, though, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt that he will explain some of these changes in the Vong.  Some of it could boil down to differences in individual Vong, but some of the differences seem almost institutional, and I'd like to know why we didn't see any evidence of it in the first book.  The final chapter, told from the Vong point of view, gives me hope that this will happen.<br />There are too many characters in this book to detail how Stackpole does on all of them, but a couple of them stand out.  Jaina Solo, Leia's daughter, is an apprentice Jedi Knight but she's also a great pilot.  She's trying very hard to get out from Leia's shadow, to be something different than she was.  Jaina also is torn because while she thinks that Leia is not fulfilling her full potential by using the Force that runs through her, Jaina is happy that it gives her something that Leia doesn't have.  She starts learning that you have to be yourself and to do things not because it's something that her mother hasn't done, but because it's something that would be good for Jaina.  When she gets a chance to be part of Rogue Squadron, she jumps at it and feels more alive then when she is being a Jedi.  It's interesting to see her growth and I look forward to seeing more of it.<br />The other standout characters is Corran Horn and Ganar.  Corran has his beliefs constantly challenged by Ganar as they try to rescue the university students.  The interplay between the two is intriguing Stackpole does a good job of showing that it's not just their philosophies that conflict, but their personalities as well.  Ganar is arrogant, thinking that because he is powerful in the Force, he's better than anybody else.  Corran knows that the Force carries a philosophy behind it that must be embraces as much as the power is.  Both characters get to show off their stuff when they discover that the Vong do have a presence on this world and the students are in danger.  I like how Stackpole, while occasionally showing Ganar in a bad light, actually has him do some smart things and actually puts Corran in his debt.  It makes for interesting, three-dimensional characters that I like to read about.<br />I think Stackpole does a wonderful job with the plot as well.  It's not as full of coincidences as Vector Prime was, with only one major one I can think of.  It's very tight, with no major holes that I could see.  The juggling of stories could have gotten annoying, but Stackpole makes all of the characters interesting enough that you don't mind switching from one story to another.  Sometimes the characters speak in annoying \\"teacher-speak,\\" where the dialogue seems intended to instill a lesson in both another character and the reader, but this didn't annoy me too much.  I just rolled my eyes and moved on.  I've noticed that this is something that Stackpole does in all of his books, so maybe I've just gotten used to it.<br />While there aren't any major action set-pieces besides the ending, that doesn't mean that there is none.  Stackpole gives a nice balance between character philosophy and action, with one never seeming to overshadow the other.  He also explains things well enough that you don't need to have read the first book (I hadn't the first time I read this one) to know what is going on.  One slight concern I have, with the number of different authors writing for this series, is that certain characters may only appear in books written by their creators.  Corran Horn and Gavin Darklighter weren't in the first book, and they appear in Stackpole's.  I'm hoping that they don't disappear once different authors take up the story.  It's too early to say it's a problem, but it's a concern that I hope will be alleviated with further books.<br />With two hits to start off the series, I'm really looking forward to more of The New Jedi Order.

US	50332419	R3LFS3VMUD98S	034540288X	861735579	The Lost World	Books	4	19	26	N	N	Dinos Dinos Everywhere!	I don't know if the dinosaurs bring out the best in Crichton or what.  I've read a few of his books and haven't really cared for them, but I loved Jurassic Park and I really enjoyed this one too.  It's a rollicking adventure story that doesn't stop very often.  When it does, though, with some long scientific asides, it stops dead.<br />Crichton sure is capable of writing an exciting tale.  I wish he'd do it more often.  Lost World has many exciting sequences as various dinosaurs (mostly Tyrannosaurus and Raptors) chase the humans all around the island.  The action is breathtaking as, just when you think the humans have solved their problem (or at least are on the road to solving it), things take a turn for the worse.  I am not one for hyperbole, but throughout the middle of the book, I couldn't put it down.  I stayed up much later than I should, and only turned out the light because it was getting too late and I still had too far to go.<br />This really isn't much more than an action yarn with some scientific ideas attached to it, though, so don't get the idea that it's really deep.  In fact, the scientific ideas are one of the problems with the book.  I'm not saying they're not accurate, as I don't know enough about them to make that judgment.  However, there are times where Crichton just stops the action dead to go on for a page or two about chaos theory, evolution, or something.  These are interesting, but they completely destroy the mood of the book.  It's almost like mixing chocolate and shrimp: sure, some people may like it, but for the rest of us who like both but hate them together, it makes the finished product just a little less palatable.  Thankfully, the asides don't come at you too much at one time, so once each one stops the ball starts rolling again.<br />Being an action thriller, the characters aren't that complex.  They seem like it at times (such as when they're spouting scientific theories), but they aren't really.  Malcolm is scarred by the events in the first book, and there's an interesting sequence where this comes into play.  Thankfully for himself and for the others, he snaps out of it fairly quickly.  I liked his character, though, because he's a combination of a realist and a cynic.  However, he uses his scientific knowledge and his intelligence to get them out of more than one scrape.  He's probably the most broadly defined of the bunch.  The other members of the expedition have their character hooks too, but they aren't that deeply explored.  Crichton spends a lot of time detailing their background, but when events start happening, they're more fodder for these events than anything else.  They are distinctive, they just aren't complex.<br />The villains of the piece, though, are pretty dull and stereotypical.  Dodgson is your typical greedy and lazy villain.  His specialty is stealing other people's research after it's been tested, because that's easier and more lucrative than doing your own research and possibly going down numerous blind alleys.  His allies are the typical nervous bunch, with one person worried that they're doing the wrong thing and the other one worried that they're doing the right thing but that it will go horribly wrong (which it inevitably does).  Thankfully, once they get events rolling to their inevitable conclusion, they're pretty much sidelined and we don't hear much about them again until the end.<br />The plot is kind of a runaround, but I really enjoyed it despite that.  There are definitely predictable events in it, such as when a character does something and you know immediately what the consequences of that action are going to be, long before any of the characters do.  That does mar things a little bit.  But it's easy to look past them because Crichton writes the action so effectively.  When characters aren't spouting scientific stuff, I almost held my breath as events happened.  Especially effective is the trailer scene, where Malcolm and Sarah have to figure out how to get safely out of a trailer that's being pushed, prodded and smashed by two enraged Tyrannosaurs.  It's hard to tell what's going to happen there, or who will survive this sequence.  Nobody (with the possible exception of Malcolm) is safe in this book, so there is a lot of tension.

It not only covers the final battle for the German capital, but it actually starts in January 1945.  The Russians are sitting on the Vistula river, just outside Warsaw, and waiting to launch one of the final attacks that will finally collapse the Nazi regime.  Beevor has done lots of research, and it shows.  This is a completely compelling book.  You do, however, have to have an interest in the subject and you should probably not be in a really bad mood when you read it.  It is kind of a downer.<br />For the most part, Beevor concentrates on the Russian front as the Germans face off against the Soviet army.  He does have a chapter or two about the other allies, but most of the time that he is talking about them, it is in relation to the Eastern Front and how some of the remaining Germans were trying to retreat to the American and British lines so that they could surrender and hopefully not get killed by the invading Soviet hordes.  Beevor also details the Yalta conference and how Stalin completely hoodwinked Churchill and Roosevelt (Roosevelt himself was very ill at this time and certainly wasn't at his best) in regards to his intentions for Poland and for Berlin.  Other than this, however, Beevor is completely devoted to action in Poland and in eastern Germany.  This isn't surprising, as most of the action in this period of the war was centred here.  Not to say there wasn't any fighting in the West, but once the Americans crossed the Rhine river, the Germans seemed more intent on making sure they didn't surrender to the Russians.<br />Beevor does a good job with the subject.  He writes in an interesting manner that doesn't contain the dryness that is prevalent in some history texts.  However, he does go deep enough into the subject that it's obviously not intended for light reading.  This is a history book, and it certainly feels like one.  It's not history-lite for somebody with just a mild interest in the subject.  Not being a historian, I can't speak to the accuracy of the research, but he does have a lot of sources, all of which are detailed in the back. He uses archives, interviews, unpublished diaries (including three sources that he insists must remain anonymous, so presumably they are Russian), mostly primary sources.  The notes, unfortunately, are in my least favourite format: instead of end or footnotes, the notes are listed by page number and then a brief snippet of a quote to state which section he is referencing. I find this incredibly annoying and hard to follow, so much so that I don't even bother after awhile.<br />The maps are outstanding as well.  Unfortunately, they are all at the front of the book, so you do find yourself flipping back and forth a little bit.  It would have been nice to have a couple of full strategic maps at the beginning of the book, but to have the tactical maps begin the section in which they are described.  Still, the maps themselves are very well done and definitely worth the time it takes to look at them before reading about the specific operation.  They detail every attack, even the attacks on the Western Front.  Since the Western Front is not talked about very much, this shows how complete they are.<br />This is a truly powerful book, especially where Beevor describes the utter devastation that affected Poland and eastern Germany.  Berlin was nothing but a pile of rubble with bombs going off everywhere and hardly any buildings without any bomb damage.  I think it affected me even more because of the time I was reading it (i.e during the Iraq war).  Here I was seeing so little (relatively speaking of course) city and civilian damage, and then I'm reading this book where cities were being bombed into oblivion.  It was very disheartening.  You certainly should not be reading this book if you're depressed.  Beevor details the horrors of war, as German citizens flee from the onrushing Soviets, victorious soldiers rape and pillage to their hearts' content, and there is so much human suffering.  Even the Polish and the captured Soviet troops were not spared any of this.  It is truly amazing sometimes what the human race is capable of, and Beevor tells us all about it.<br />That is another small fault with this book, though.  While I certainly understand the concentration on the devastation that was inflicted on the Germans, Beevor really seems to centre on the subject of rape.  Time and time again he comes back to the subject, and it became a bit annoying after awhile.  This is not necessarily because he kept coming back to it, but because every time he did come back to it, he'd go on for a couple of pages about it.  It started to get monotonous. I realize that this happened, and that it shouldn't be white-washed, but after the first few times he could surely just briefly cover the fact that more rapes happened at this time.  Either that, or he should have just had a chapter detailing the horrors that happened and then not really talked about them again.<br />Ultimately, though, this is a very worthy book, with just enough minor quibbles to bring it down to four stars.  If you like military history, this is definitely the book for you.  This period of World War II is not well-documented in book form, at least not that I've seen.  Beevor does a great job of covering the subject and I think you'll like it.  You certainly won't enjoy it, but you will find it compelling.

US	50332419	RW95U60O03PAD	0765302632	209769670	The Prize in the Game (Sulien)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Gods and the curses that they bring	The Prize in the Game is a short novel that takes place in the world of Walton's The King's Peace and The King's Name.  It gives a little history on a few of the characters, and takes place before the other two books, with events in this one leading up to the characters' entrances in The King's Peace.  It's a wonderfully done piece, with not a word wasted.<br />At 253 pages, it is certainly a quick read, but there is so much packed into it that it feels like a longer book.  Walton writes a lean and mean novel that doesn't use any extraneous language or plots.  The book is about Emer and Conal, but it is also about Elenn and how she compares to her sister, Emer.  It's about friendship, love, and honour, and the power that all three have over the life we live.  How Walton manages to package all of this together in such a small package, I have no idea.<br />Emer and Conal's love story is a sight to behold.  They both start out the book very young, with not much idea of what their future holds. Emer is sixteen, and really too young to be considered an adult, but she takes arms just like her slightly older companions do.  Conal starts out the book talking about how beautiful Elenn is, but you quickly realize that he has no feelings for her whatsoever.  When he stumbles across Emer (relatively plain compared to Elenn), he finds that he has discovered the love of his life.  When both take up arms, Emer wants nothing more than to be Conal's charioteer and wife.  When Walton writes these two, they just spring off the page.  You feel their pain when they realize the many obstacles in their path, both from her mother and from the circumstances around them.  They are well-rounded characters who are very interesting as well.<br />The second story has to do with Elenn.  She is not the military sort like her sister, and she has no interest in going out and killing something.  She's more than ready to be married off by her mother for a good alliance.  She doesn't like the fact that she won't get to choose her husband, and she has fallen in love with Ferdia.  But Ferdia would not make a good alliance as it doesn't look like he's going to become king of anything.  Also, Ferdia is not in love with her, which adds an air of tragedy to the whole proceedings.  This is especially true when Ferdia is forced into a potentially deadly situation because he can't let on that he doesn't love her and doesn't want to marry her.  In less capable hands, Elenn could have come off as nothing but a spoiled brat.  Walton handles her delicately and is able to make you interested in her story.  She still comes off as a bit of a spoiled brat, but she slowly learns what it will take to get out from under her mother's thumb and what it takes to truly be an adult.  She is probably my least favourite character, but not because Walton does her badly.  It's just that the other characters are so much better.  That's a good thing in a writer.  It's truly sad when her mother (Maga) gets her into a situation where Maga constantly weds her to a champion only to have that champion go off and die the next day.  You can truly see what effect this has on her.<br />Finally, there is the Darag-Ferdia story.  This has less impact than the other two, but I found it just as interesting.  Ferdia loves Darag and Darag has considered Ferdia a brother to him.  Ferdia has trouble accepting all of this, as well as accepting that Elenn is in love with him but he could never return that love.  He is despondent, and a rash act of giving a gift to Elenn because he doesn't want it leads to consequences that Ferdia couldn't predict.  As his story unfolds, you find yourself really feeling for him and his situation.  It looks like there is no way out for him.  Darag, meanwhile, gets all that he has ever wanted, but at a price that could be too terrible to pay.  It's almost gut-wrenching when he finally figures out what it will cost him.  Both of these characters are very deep characters, even thoughWalton doesn't spend quite as much time on them as on the others.<br />As interesting as all of the characters are, the plot and the prose are just as good.  Walton uses very effective foreshadowing to give the reader hints to what is to come.  I've never been very good at picking up on stuff like this, so I was often saying to myself \\"So that's what she meant!\\"  There's also some foreshadowing to events in the first two books, especially Conal's fate.  There is not a wasted action or an extra word in this book.  Every action has a purpose and even when I knew that an event meant something else was coming along later, Walton managed to surprise me by showing that I was right, but that my prediction for what was coming was way off.  I like being surprised in a book, especially when I think I know what's going to happen.<br />I can't say enough about this book.  I would think that it is readable even if you haven't read the first two books, but there are so many nuances that will only mean something to people who have read them, that I can't recommend that you start here.  It is a prequel of sorts, but it has a much greater effect if you're already familiar with subsequent events.  However you decide to do it though, if you like fantasy you have to read this book.gh Walton doesn't spend quite as much time on them as on the others.<br />As interesting as all of the characters are, the plot and the prose are just as good.

US	50332419	R3NEBQSM98PH1Q	0743419235	63918912	2: The Brave and the Bold Book Two (Star Trek)	Books	3	8	8	N	N	What a downer ending for a great 2-book series	The first book in the Brave and the Bold 2-part series introduced a very intriguing concept, but the second book doesn't carry it through.  The book has two stories, the first of which is pretty good and almost holds up the quality of the first book.  However, the second falls to pieces, bringing the entire series down with it.<br />The first book in this series was so well written and exciting, that I was really looking forward to a riveting conclusion.  One of the minor gripes with the entire series, like all of the Star Trek book series that incorporate all of the television crews, is that it became a little bit too much of a coincidence that the same things would happen to all of our familiar crew members.  Candido alleviated that a little bit by having other crews involved as well: in the first book, it was Decker and his ship and then the crew of the Odyssey.  Further along those lines, Candido provides even more distance by making Tuvok and Chakotay the only two familiar characters in the Voyager story.  I found that this helped considerably.<br />The first story is really well-told, as DeCandido does a good job of fleshing out some characters that we saw only briefly in the TV series (Cal Hudson) as well as creating some very interesting characters for the Hood.  The Hood doesn't have as much to do as the ships did in the previous book, but the characters that DeCandido creates for it, especially Captain DeSoto, are vivid.  DeSoto is a champion at the game of Go, and he has created a monster by teaching his first officer the game (and now she constantly beats him).  It becomes a running gag throughout the story.  It seems a bit superfluous, but it adds greatly to the character, as we feel we know him.  DeCandido doesn't do as good of a job with the villain of the piece, though.  The Andorian is very two-dimensional, going crazy because of the death of his family.  He becomes very boring after awhile, and it's good that the story is short.  The Maquis characters that DeCandido creates fulfill their roles well, but are rather basic otherwise.  The distrust of Tuvok is understandable, but that's pretty much all there is.<br />While the Voyager story is pretty good, the Next Generation story that ends the book just completely falls apart.  One of the problems with it is that it seems to be a showcase for DeCandido's new series of books about the IKS Gorkon and less a Next Generation story.  That's fine in and of itself, but that's not really the way the book was sold.  They do seem like an interesting crew, and DeCandido makes them intriguing to read about, but Picard and the rest of the Enterprise crew are bit players in their own story.<br />The second problem, and the one that made me almost want to put this book down in frustration many times in its short 140 page duration, was the constant explanation of continuity references.  In many Star Trek books, there are so many references to past episodes that it can strangle a story.  Others handle this very deftly, by either not including many references or by the author being very capable of explaining just enough of the references to not leave the new reader confused without bogging down the story.  Throughout the first three stories in this series, DeCandido did a really good job of this.  They were not intrusive, but they also weren't mystifying.  Even better, a lot of these \\"references\\" were actually references to things that we haven't seen before, because they dealt with the new characters that DeCandido had created.  That made them interesting.  Unfortunately, in this final story, the continuity references come at the reader fast and furious, and DeCandido uses paragraph after paragraph to explain them.  Most of them only need one paragraph, but when there are multiple references on each page, it starts to add up and get very messy. Not only are there references to television episodes, but there are multiple references to other books, as well (especially concerningthe Gorkon, which has appeared on one of DeCandido's previous books).<br />The story also feels very staged and ends up being anti-climactic.  DeCandido moves all of the pieces around, has them do their assigned jobs, and then has the book end within one page in a very boring way.  Finally, there is fifteen pages of story after the ending, which makes the rest of the story seem very inconsequential.  I understand that this is the conclusion to the two-book series, and thus needs to be there, but when the story itself is only 140 pages, it doesn't add much to the final story.  I wouldn't mind so much if the story itself were actually good, but this really needed a bit more to it.<br />On a positive note, though, the crew of the Gorkon is very interesting, and I'm looking forward to their series.  DeCandido is a good writer (this story not-withstanding) and I think he'll do a good job with it.  It highlights the differences between Klingon ships and the Federation ships that we're all familiar with, as well as containing good characters to boot.  I have to admit I was surprised by one of the deaths, because I thought that this character was one of the more interesting ones and I was looking forward to seeing the character in the new series.  I was touched by the character, and really sorry to see the death.  In such a short story that contains so much, that's a rare feat.<br />Overall, the series is very good, but it the final story is a big let down.  Speaking specifically about this book, it contains a 4-star story and a 2-star story.  Thus, I'll split the difference and make it 3-stars.  What a waste.<br />David Roythe Gorkon, which has appeared on one of DeCandido's previous books). <br />The story also feels very staged and ends up being anti-climactic.

It is a series of four novellas contained in two books, each novella involving one of the four Trek television series, with a prologue that involves the fifth.  Not only is the concept intriguing, but DeCandido does a wonderful job with the first book.  It contains a wonderful mix of the characters we know and the ones that he has created, along with characters who were briefly shown in a television episode whom he has fleshed out to a great degree.  The first book is a knockout punch, and I enjoyed it very much.<br />DeCandido has created a very logical way to bring the five television series together into one set of books.  It does feel a bit stretched, as yet again the main cast of each show are involved in the same events, but at least DeCandido involves other ships and people as well, lessening that impact a little bit.  DeCandido makes good use of the formerly incidental characters from the television series to flesh out the story.  Even better, though, the stories are told completely from their viewpoint, so that all of the familiar characters that we know and love are seen from an outsider's view.  I found this very effective, as we got to see our heroes as other see them without delving into their thought processes.<br />In the first story, DeCandido has created a vibrant crew that is interesting to read about.  Decker is the only character from the television series, all other characters being original.  Decker matches what little we know about him from the series, and the rest of the crew comes across very well also.  Takashewada is Decker's no-nonsense first officer who keeps him in line when he wants to go against the book.  She's completely against the imposition of martial law on the planet and is ready to tell Decker in no uncertain terms about it when she gets the chance.  Fortunately for Decker, she never does, as the situation is resolved before that can happen.  She's very determined but you can also tell that she really likes Decker, and that he finds her a very valuable officer.  Dr. Rosenhaus is a bit too much of a Dr. Bashir (from the series Deep Space 9) clone, given that he's a young doctor excited to be out on the frontier.  He's arrogant and thinks he can fix anything, as well as thinking that he knows better than some of the old hands.  However, the relationship he develops with Dr. McCoy of the Enterprise is wonderful.  When they first meet, sparks fly as arrogance clashes with experience and McCoy's crotchetiness.  Soon, though, a healthy respect develops, especially after Rosenhaus goes off half-cocked and almost kills an experimental subject.  Rosenhaus learns some humility when McCoy doesn't berate him (too much) for what happened.  Other crew members do well in the limited parts that DeCandido gives them, and all of them seem to have distinct personalities no matter how little screen time they have.<br />Much the same can be said for the second story, and the crew of the Odyssey.  DeCandido tries to do a couple of things in this story.  In the television episode in which the Odyssey appears, there is a healthy dislike between Keogh and Lieutenant Dax.  This story gives us the reason why, which helps flesh out Keogh and also provides another dimension to the episode.  There aren't as many new characters in this story, but DeCandido does a good job with them as well.  Especially effective is Orta, who is a Bajoran terrorist from a Next Generation television episode.  DeCandido gives him a lot of background and broadens him a lot.  He's a terrorist, not a freedom fighter.  He fought Cardassians because he hated them, not because he wanted to free Bajor.  DeCandido paints a wonderful picture of a man who's lost in his own insanity.  When Orta finally makes his move, his reasoning keeps on changing as Kira and Dax point out the logical holes in each story he tells.  Descending deeper and deeper into madness, you almost start feeling pity for him forwhat he's gone through and what he has finally become.<br />What I found most effective about these stories, at least to me as a Trek fan, is the sense of tragedy that is evoked.  Both the Constellation and the Odyssey were destroyed with all hands in the television episodes where they appear.  Both of these stories take place shortly before that.  We are getting to know these characters, getting to like them, and then we realize that they are not going to survive much longer.  I liked that, and it's a tribute to DeCandido's characterization that we wish we had more time with them.  Also, the fact that most of the crew is created by DeCandido gives us the possibility that not all of the characters will survive the story, which provides a nice bit of extra tension.<br />There isn't a whole lot to say about the plot.  The stories are interesting, but nothing that special.  I found the characters much more interesting than the plot, which is just as well.  The plots are almost Trek-by-numbers, which isn't always a bad thing, especially in a franchise series of books.  They do their job well, and don't get in the way of the characters.  I liked that.  We don't get a lot of information about the Zalkat Union, which makes the artifacts little more than McGuffins, though they are at least used in each story.  It's the characters that make this book worth reading, and any Trek fan will enjoy it because of that.  If you like Star Trek, I think you will like this book.  I just hope the second book in this series is as good as the first.<br />David Roywhat he's gone through and what he has finally become.<br />What I found most effective about these stories, at least to me as a Trek fan, is the sense of tragedy that is evoked.

US	50332419	R3E18N1KIXPIY	0441010083	677086762	Dragon Blood (The Hurog Duology, Book 2)	Books	4	65	66	N	N	It's in the Veins	Dragon Blood, by Patricia Briggs, is the sequel to Dragon Bones.  It's a much quieter novel than its predecessor, but with much more drastic implications for Ward and his people.  I actually liked it a bit better than the first as well.  When I was reading it, it seemed like it was moving a little too slow, but when I was finished, I felt a lot more satisfied.  While quieter, it has a lot more meat to it.<br /><br />This is a nice little novel, with none of the few problems that the previous book had.  At 275 pages, it is a quick and easy read.  Briggs fills this book with more examination of character and less fighting, with only one big fight toward the end of the book.  This time, Ward must prove himself as a political leader and not just a warrior.  Thus, the action quotient is very much lower.  Briggs makes up for it, though, by telling an interesting story that doesn't need a lot of sword fights.  She concentrates on characterization, making this a much stronger book.<br /><br />The book is told in a partial first person from Ward's point of view, with other chapters from various other characters' points of view as well (told in third person).  This really enhances the characterization, as we not only get Ward's thoughts on a lot of issues, but also some of the other characters' thoughts as well.  This is most effective in the blossoming romance between Tisala and Ward.  Ward is very attracted to her and wants to marry her, but she feels that she is too old for him and too much of a warrior and less of a homemaker.  Briggs really handles this romance nicely, with both parties being tentative but not sinking down into the depths of cliche.  It's very adult, and if Briggs writes another sequel, it will be interesting to see what the future holds for these characters.<br /><br />The rest of the characterization isn't bad either.  Briggs give them just enough that they aren't stereotypes.  Even Jakoven escapes the dreaded superficial characterization problem.  He's thoroughly evil, but he's given just that much of an extra dimension that he becomes more than just the villain.  He's sadistic and ruthless, but he's also intelligent.  Even his eventual downfall is caused more by a daring move on our heroes' part then by Jakoven doing something stupid.  I liked that.<br /><br />The plot of the book is quite interesting as well.  Briggs explores the idea of dragons in this world a lot more, and we in doing so we find out even more about Oreg, ostensibly the wizard of Hurog but in reality one of the elder dragons from a long-dead time.  We find out more about the history of the land from Oreg as he recounts what happened with Farsonbane all those years ago.  When he uses Farsonbane against a settlement, Jakoven shows just how insane he is and Ward becomes even more determined to stop him.  Briggs ties it all together very nicely, with only a couple of slow moments in the middle of the book that drag it down a notch.  She spends just a bit too much time on Ward's torture scenes and the attempts to made to get him out of there.  I don't know if they could have been shortened at all, as most of them are rather important, but I believe she could have punched them up a bit.  Don't worry about gross scenes here, though, as they aren't very graphic at all.  Though sometimes you may wish they were to liven them up a bit.<br /><br />Still, this period of the book doesn't go on very long, though considering the book isnt very long to begin with, it's sad that there are any slow parts whatsoever.<br /><br />The ending of the book is also a bit anticlimactic, though it doesn't have anywhere near the problems that the first book had.  It very logically flows from events in the book, so there's no problem there.  It just seems a bit quick.  There are a couple of confrontations, some quick magic, and the problem appears to be solved.  There's also not really much of an aftermath, so the book feels like it just ends.  I don't really have a problem with that, though, as long as the ending is effective.  It is, for the most part, except for the quick way that it happens.<br /><br />The slow part and the quick ending aren't enough to detract from the quality of this book, though.  It's not a groundbreaking book at all, but it fulfills the purpose for which it was written: it entertains, it passes the time in an enjoyable manner, and it tells a good story.  What more could you ask for?  You'll like it even more if you're a sucker for dragons like I am.ding is effective.  It is, for the most part, except for the quick way that it happens.

It's a very personal account, as Ambrose conducted numerous interviews with the surviving members of the company and uses those interviews to imbue a sense of closeness to the action and the men who went into that action.  It's a very effective book, though it does seem to be \\"history lite.\\"  I'm not really sure why, because Ambrose has obviously done a lot of research in producing this story.  Perhaps it is because it's not a typical history book with documentation from all over the place.  Instead, he seems to have used only a couple of sources besides the men of Easy themselves.  Then again, is that a bad thing?  Personally, I don't think so, at least not in this case.  Ambrose is not attempting to write a history of World War II.  He's writing the story of a group of men who formed relationships and bonds that would carry them through the rest of their lives.<br />I found this book fascinating.  Most of the history books I have read have been very abstract, telling about the moving of units and what they did and how successful they were in battle.  They always have some personal angles involved, either talking about letters written home, or some personal stories of valor.  Ultimately, though, they are about the battles themselves.  These books can be very interesting.<br />Band of Brothers tells us everything about a group of men and how they fought.  We get to laugh with them, we get to see the horrors that they have seen.  We also get to see the incompetence that sometimes becomes prevalent in wartime.  Ambrose doesn't pull any punches, and neither do the men of Easy to whom he spoke.  They are very outspoken about the people they didn't like.  Not just people, but also nationalities.  One thing to keep in mind when reading this book is that the only impression of nationalities that these men had were when they were going through territory, wondering whether or not they would be running into enemy fire at any time.  Some people of these nationalities may take offense at some of the statements in this book.  One fault with it is that Ambrose doesn't really make clear whether or not these feelings are just the feelings of the men at the time, or if these feelings have stayed with the men ever since.<br />The descriptions of the action are just incredible.  Never before have I seen war from this perspective.  While I have seen graphic descriptions of combat before, this story takes the reader to a much deeper level.  We get to see the fear and the determination of these soldiers, the comradeship that forms among them.  We get to see individual episodes of action in each battle, we see friends die, we see true heroism, and how situations can get messed up in an instant.  We also get to see the foibles of the men, how some of them got drunk at every opportunity, how they dealt with war and what it did to them.  It truly is remarkable.<br />One other thing that is missing in this book, to an extent, is a sense of context to these events.  Ambrose does provide this occasionally, especially when talking about Market Garden and the plight of the British paratroopers in the city of Arnhem, but he's not always successful in doing this.  I wasn't expecting long passages about what was going on elsewhere, but there are times in this book where the action seems very isolated from the war around the men.  It's a very narrow view, and while it is understandable since this isn't a history of the war, it does make the actions of Easy seem a little removed.<br />There are few maps in the book, but they do the job.  They are at the front of the book, and they consist of a map of northern France and England, a close-up map of Utah Beach (the beach behind which Easy dropped on D-Day), a close up view of Market Garden, and close-up view of Bastogne.  They do the job, letting you follow a bit of the action.  I don't know if itwould have been possible, but it would have been nice to see some maps of the cities involved in the battles, so we could get a sense of what the men of Easy were doing in each battle.  But again, that may not have been possible, so I won't hold it against Ambrose.<br />I really liked the chapter talking about the men after the war.  I felt it really solidified the relationship that the reader has with these men.  You have spent the rest of the book getting to know these men and seeing the horrors of war with them, and now you get to find out \\"the rest of the story.\\"  It adds the perfect climax to the book, and reinforces the feeling that this is a personal history of a group of men and not a history of warfare.  Some of the fates are tragic, but most of them just got on with their lives.  It was nice to see.<br />Ultimately, this is a very valuable book for anybody who likes reading about warfare.  It adds a very personal touch to the whole thing.  There aren't long descriptions of blood and guts, but you do see just enough to feel the tension along with these men.  I feel like I know these men, and I'm proud to know them.  They put their lives on the line for freedom, and they did it willingly and without question.  They didn't like it, but they did it anyway.  Seeing their story told in such a manner was a wonderful experience.  So what if it's history lite?  It's a valuable story and it's wonderfully told.  That's all that matters.it would have been possible, but it would have been nice to see some maps of the cities involved in the battles, so we could get a sense of what the men of Easy were doing in each battle.

US	50332419	RC1UO424SQ2GJ	0563538406	542655598	Dying in the Sun (Doctor Who)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	I'm going to make you a STAR!	Dying in the Sun seems to be an examination of Hollywood and how the American public sees celebrities.  Much is made of the star quality of a few of the characters, though in this book, a large part of that is artificial.  Then again, that's probably the point: that the star quality that we see in our movie stars is artificial, manufactured by Hollywood producers and the pop culture mentality that makes some of us follow these people's lives religiously.  It's an interesting idea, though it's been done many times so it's not a new one.  I think it's a very nice touch that this is done in 1947, which is during the movie studio era.  I think it would have been too easy to make it a modern-day story.<br />However, Miller doesn't imbue the story with a lot of energy.  The book is a fairly easy read, so it moves fairly quickly in that manner.  However, it doesn't draw you in, grabbing you and making you read it until the end.  It's a very straightforward story, almost a run-around.  The Doctor bounces from location to location, trying to figure things out, making a deduction or two, and then goes on to the next situation.  Surprisingly, even though the Doctor does a lot of running around and nosing into things, ultimately he doesn't have a lot to do with the resolution.  He has a hand in the final fate of the villain, but the situation starts to fall apart through the actions of another character.  It's yet another example of the ineffectual Doctor that permeates the Past Doctor series of books.  I found this rather disappointing.<br />The characterization is pretty solid, though nothing outstanding.  The Second Doctor is one of the hardest Doctors to get right on the printed page, as so much of what we like about him is provided by the performance on television of Patrick Troughton.  In book form, many authors try to capture Troughton mannerisms without catching the charm that Troughton brought to the character.  In this case, Miller does a decent job of getting it right.  It's not completely recognizable as the Second Doctor, but he does make him distinct enough to be satisfying.  And he avoids using some Troughton cliches, such as \\"Oh my giddy aunt!\\"  I was very glad to see that.  In Dying in the Sun, the second Doctor is inquisitive, intelligent, not willing to be bullied by authority but not contemptuous of it.  He is an interesting character to read about, and I did enjoy seeing what he would do.<br />The other characters are pretty good too, though nothing special.  Ben and Polly are pretty close to their televised counterparts, but they're not fleshed out to any real degree.  Polly is very easily seduced into the star culture of Hollywood and is a typical late 1960's party girl.  Ben is protective of her, a sailor who's tough as nails when he needs to be but doesn't always understand what's going on.  Polly's side of the story is kind of interesting, as she gives a personal touch to the story's examination of Hollywood when she starts feeling like she is a star.  She embodies the arrogance and selfishness that pervades this sort of culture.  The rest of the story is about that too, but her story gives us an inside look at it, and I thought it was pretty effective.<br />The new characters are pretty basic, though not badly done.  De Sande is a very credible bad guy.  The reader is never sure how much of what he's doing is because he's a villain and how much is from some other source.  The two other characters who get most of the screentime are Robert Chate and Detective William Fletcher.  Chate is a very good ambiguous character.  He's a drug dealer, but he starts out the novel wanting to get out of the business.  He's always been in love with a former screen star, and when he finally meets her as he's on the run, things don't go quite as expected.  He gives us the outsider's view of Hollywood and demonstrates the possible result of our fascination with these stars.  Polly gets into trouble because she wants to *be* a star,but Robert has problems because he's in love with one.<br />Fletcher is the typical irascible detective who will do anything to find the truth of what happened.  As is typical in Doctor Who stories, the Doctor sidesteps the suspicion that is placed on him and becomes an integral part of the investigation.  Fletcher is sort of stereotypical in how he reacts to this, and he ends up becoming part of the run-around.  However, his character has a really interesting twist that I won't give away, which redeems him in my eyes.  Don't worry that he's sounds typical.  Following his story will pay off at the end.<br />This review sounds very ambivalent, and that pretty much sums up my reaction to this book.  It takes a great idea, does a few good things with it, but makes it's not interesting enough to really hold the reader's attention.  The climax of the story breaks down into an action piece that doesn't really fit well with the rest of the novel, and is almost anti-climactic in that sense.  It only adds to the interest level if you need a little action to wake you up.  It's a very traditional Doctor Who story, and fans who like that sort of thing may find this book very good.  However, it's not a very good introduction to the book series, as I'm afraid anybody who doesn't already like the series would probably be turned off by it.<br />Consider this a very qualified recommendation.but Robert has problems because he's in love with one.<br />Fletcher is the typical irascible detective who will do anything to find the truth of what happened.

Fortress Draconis is a sequel to the military fantasy novel, The Dark Glory War and is book one in the Dragoncrown War Cycle.  This book, however, is epic in scope and much more character-driven then the previous book.  It's a good start to the series, marred only by one of the main characters being an incredible bore.<br />The Dark Glory War was a very interesting set-up for this story.  It ended on a final note that, if you wanted to stop reading, you could have.  However, it did entice you to get the next book.  This is that book, and it is a lot better than the previous one.  First, Fortress Draconis is not simply military fantasy.  It is much deeper than that, and the emphasis is not on violence, blood flowing, heads flying off, and battle tactics.  These things are in the book, so it's still not for the squeamish.  But Stackpole adds scope to the plot, making it have a much grander feel.  I really appreciated that.<br />Secondly, he adds deeper characterization to the mix.  The story has a number of viewpoint characters, so we learn details about more than just the narrator.  Alexia, Will and Kerrigan are the main viewpoint characters, though we do see some sections from minor viewpoints as well.  This was a great addition, as one of the problems with The Dark Glory War was the fact that Tarrant was the only person I felt I knew after reading that one.  Stackpole also does a better job of characterizing the people of whom we don't see the viewpoints.  I get the feeling that he didn't care as much about the characterization in the first book because of the type of book it was, but this time he seems to have worked a lot harder at it.<br />The only failure in this aspect of the novel is Kerrigan.  He is the ultimate innocent, formed by his wizard mentors to be the most powerful wizard that has been seen in quite awhile.  However, he has been sheltered and thus doesn't know very much about life.  When we first meet him, he is felled to tears because he has a cut.  I see what Stackpole is trying to do with this character, but unfortunately it doesn't work for me.  He is boring, and the book screeches to a stop whenever he's the viewpoint character.  He's arrogant, but he also whines a lot when things don't go his way.  When his not knowing how to act results in a death, he whines some more.  It's an understandable reaction, but the way Stackpole writes him, I felt more annoyance at him than sympathy for his situation.  He does get a bit better as time goes on, and I can tell Stackpole has some big plans for him.  Hopefully, this upward cycle will continue and he won't be as annoying in the next book.<br />Stackpole's plotting and writing are really nice as well.  I liked the choices that he made.  One of my complaints about the previous book was that Chytrine was actually made a character in the last section of the book and I felt she was too simply written.  This time, Stackpole seems to have taken a lesson from Lord of the Rings.  She is not on-screen at all, except as seen in the distance.  In LotR, we never see Sauron, and I think that's a good thing.  In this case, Chytrine becomes an ominous presence and not a character to roll your eyes at.  I was very impressed.  Instead, we see the \\"heroes\\" of the previous expedition to destroy her, and we see how they have been corrupted.  If the reader is familiar with them from having read the previous book, there is a sense of tragedy in this as well, and it really works.  The prose is not outstanding, but it services the plot well.  There are no glowing passages, but there are also no clunkers reveling in their purpleness.<br />Thankfully, there is no need to have read the previous book, as most of the information a reader needs to understand what is going on is included in this book.  Some of the revelations will mean more (such as Crow's secret, which I will not reveal even though other reviews have, which ruined it for me), but that's not a big thing.<br />The only other minor problem with this book is that it still feels a bit like a fantasy role-playing game set to novel form.  The party of heroes is even a classic party from one of those games: a wizard, a thief, and three fighters.  Healing is done by the wizard, so there's no need for a cleric.  Thus you get the feeling you could follow along in your game if you wanted to.  However, that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of reading this book.  It manages to lift itself beyond the typical role-playing fiction by providing interesting characters (except Kerrigan, of course) and intriguing situations.  If you don't mind a little blood spilt and some severed limbs, then you can't go wrong with this one.inor problem with this book is that it still feels a bit like a fantasy role-playing game set to novel form.

Some of you may have seen my earlier review of his newer book, Confessions of a Cineplex Heckler.  That was a very funny, vicious look at Hollywood and the movie business.  This is an earlier book, collecting essays from the early 1990s written for Movieline, Rolling Stone, and one article for the Washington Post, and contains many of the same elements.  However, while Heckler was chock full of hilarity, insults, wisecracks and the like, this one doesn't have as many of these.  Instead, there are some very fine articles analyzing movies and the careers of certain stars (Jessica Lange, Sean Young, Keanu Reeves, for example).  Thus, while I found Heckler much more entertaining than this book, I found this one much more interesting.<br />That's not to say there aren't hilarious articles dealing with the categorization of movies by various odds and ends included in them (such as the opening essay, which deals with older men falling love and having sexual relations with jailbait in the movies).  Some of the funniest articles I've read from Queenan are in this book, such as his attempt to \\"be Mickey Rourke for a day.\\"  In this article, he details how he went four days without bathing, dressed up all in black, and determined to travel throughout New York acting like Mickey Rourke, doing and saying things that he has said in his movies or in interviews.  This includes trying to find a prostitute who will fondle a blond woman like the prostitute Rourke makes do this to Kim Basinger in 9 ½ Weeks, smoking tons of cigarettes, and repeatedly telling complete strangers that \\"sometimes, you just gotta roll the potato.\\"  He also swears a lot.<br />The funniest article in the book has to be his list of 25 of the most senseless movies ever made.  These are not movies that are just plain stupid, because usually even stupid movies are easy to follow.  No, these are movies that make no sense whatsoever.  Included in this list is Joe vs the Volcano, The Night Porter, The Two Jakes, and King David.  He goes on to describe just why these movies have made the list.  In this essay, he reaches the heights of vicious humour and commentary as he savages these films.  Even if you disagree with him (as my wife does on a couple of them), you will still find this article worth reading and laughing at.<br />Other categorization essays include bad clerics in movies, musicians in movies (and why they usually are terrible), the first installment of \\"Don't Try This at Home\\" (where he tries various things that happen in movies and see if they are even remotely realistic), and a complete castigation of the use of bad accents in movies.  These articles vary between wonderful and passable, with most being toward the former.  \\"Don't Try This at Home\\" is the only one that is a letdown.  Queenan's at his funniest when he lists movies by category and shows why it is a bad thing that they are in this category.<br />I was quite surprised, however, to find some truly introspective articles in this book as well.  No, Queenan doesn't let his trademark wit leave him, but these articles are tempered by some true compliments and compassion.  These articles were written before most of Hollywood started avoiding him, so there are some articles with actual interviews.  Queenan uses these interviews as starting points to analyze the careers of the actor or actress in question, and he does a surprisingly fair job of it.  The article on Sean Young is very fair to her, even though it does tend to emphasize the fact that she was taking high school algebra lessons right before the interview.  Even so, he sounds quite impressed that she'd be willing to do this.  Other interviews with Keanu Reeves and Jessica Lange, while perhaps showing them in not the best light, are extremely complimentary of their work, even in bad films.  I found these articles very interesting and I'm glad I read them.  They showed me a side of the stars that you normally don't see (and that is probably why nobody will talk to him anymore).<br />He is a bit less compassionate when he is analyzing a career without the input of the celebrity in question, such as when he questions Barbra Streisand's move away from light comedies to the pretentious and disastrous movies she's made since.  He also has a brilliant analysis of Alfred Hitchcock movies (or at least brilliant-sounding, since I have never seen one of his movies) and how they represent some of Hitchcock's true feelings about things.  It's very insightful, and will take the reader past the surface of his films and dig deep into how these movies reflected his own neuroses.  I found it fascinating.  Even in these articles, though, he finds some good things to say about the subjects, and that's what made them even more interesting.<br />The only real misses in this book are the shorter articles.  I don't know if it's because Queenan needs time to really delve into his subject to make it interesting, or if he just needs time to get himself going, but the shorter articles inevitably fall flat.  Thankfully, that shortness makes them easy to digest before moving on to the meatier, far better essays.<br />The book is still sprinkled with vulgar language and some of the articles are on the sharp side, so if you don't like biting humour and quite a few f-words, this book probably isn't for you.  But if you don't mind that stuff and you like movies, this book is definitely worth reading.

It was with a bit of trepidation that I started the first book in the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order series, Vector Prime.  It's been a long while since I've read a Star Wars book, and the ones I had read before weren't the greatest.  However, I've heard good things about this series, so I decided to pick the first one up.  And I am glad I did.  While it's not an outstanding book, it is a very good one.  It's well-written with lots of action scenes, and brought back a bit of a feeling of the movies.<br />There are many good things about this book.  The Empire no longer exists, but the Yuuzhan Vong seem like they will be a formidable enemy for Luke and his friends.  They have that seemingly unstoppable quality about them that brings to mind the Empire, but they are different enough that they don't seem like retreads.  The Vong are a very organic species.  They use living things as their ships as well as many of their weapons.  Insects that are bred to cut through the metal of ships or that cut through flesh with the slightest touch.  I found them a very interesting species, and I think they will be an intriguing enemy for the New Republic to fight.  I look forward to reading more about them in subsequent books.<br />The main characters are well done.  They are the same characters we know and love from the movies, but they have changed enough to acknowledge that they are older and wiser now.  They seem a little bit more resigned to their battles, not glorying in them as they used to.  Han and Leia, with teenage children now who want to be in the thick of the action, realize that their kids are becoming what they were all those years ago.  Luke and his wife, Mara Jade, are also very interesting.  Luke's dilemma about the Jedi Council seems like something that will come up in later books, as he doesn't have a lot of time to think about the idea in this one.  It adds to the feeling of a series, as the reader gets the idea that more is happening than just what is going on in the story itself.  Mara is fighting off a mysterious illness that seems to be infecting some people sensitive to the Force, and while she continues to battle hard, it's a battle that it looks like she may lose.  The main characters are given interesting problems to deal with and it makes them people you want to read about.<br />The death of a major character is stunning (unless, of course, you've heard all about it already), and it bodes well for this series.  You will never know whether or not a character who is in danger will actually die.  This really sets the tone for the entire series, one that will be dark and where anything can happen.  But don't worry.  There are numerous light moments in this book as well, despite the foreboding feel of the plot.  The good-natured competition between the three Solo children is great, and the interplay between Lando and the others is quite good as well.<br />One of the major problems with this book is Danni Quee and the other characters who are at the edge of the galaxy, monitoring.  They are the first ones to notice the Vong coming, though they think at first it's just an asteroid or something.  However, the problem is that these are some of the most uninteresting characters I've read about in awhile.  They go through the motions of what they are supposed to do, fulfilling their functions happily but not engaging the reader's interest at all.  Whenever they appear on the stage, the story grinds to a halt.  They don't even register much when they meet their inevitable fate.  Danni gets off better than the rest, but that's because she has more of a function.  It's almost like Salvatore needed some characters to have Danni play off of, but otherwise didn't want to expend much effort in them.<br />Another problem is that the book is overwritten a bit.  One thing I hate is when exclamation marks are used by the narrator.  I think that it's an attempt to add false tension and excitement to a book, and it really turns me off.Salvatore does that a few times in this book, and it brought me up short each time.  It's annoying, and I wish authors would stop doing that.  The book was exciting enough without this.  Salvatore really has a good sense of the action scene, and it seems he went to the Michael Stackpole school of writing about space battles.  Ships are flying all over the place, some blowing up, some not.  The pace is fluid and never dull.  It's hard to do something like this in prose, but Salvatore does a good job.  The tension never lets up during these scenes, a sign of a good action writer.  I was very impressed.  The battle at the end of the book is especially breathtaking.<br />All in all, though, this is a great start to the New Jedi Order series.  It sets the scene very well, sets the mood, and introduces all of the characters.  A lot of the main characters were introduced in previous books, but Salvatore presents everything you need to know about them.  Their histories are not told completely, so there are some subtle nuances that long-time readers will see that newcomers won't, but it doesn't hurt the book at all.  A large part of the plot is dependent on coincidences, but that's par for the course in the Star Wars universe, so it didn't bug me that much.  If it bugs you, then you may find a few too many \\"yeah, right\\" moments.  But for me, it's a good start, and I can't wait to read more.Salvatore does that a few times in this book, and it brought me up short each time.

Atkinson presents a rich and detailed account of every battle that took place.  This book had me fascinated from page one, and it didn't let up until I had finished it.  I have not read such a complete account of the battle before, and the combination of Atkinson's writing and newness of the material made me race through this book faster than I have ever read such a lengthy tome.  The only thing that slowed me down is the weight of the book, as it prevented me from taking it to work on the bus.  A hardcover, at 541 pages of text plus 140 pages of notes and indices, it's pretty hefty.  However, it was well worth the effort.<br />Atkinson is an ex-journalist, and the level of detail in this book speaks to that.  The book covers everything from the initial planning and preparation of the invasion, to the boring (for the soldiers) time stuck in Morocco after the front lines had moved on to Tunisia, to the meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt at Casablanca, to the final endgame as the German defences collapsed.  Atkinson tells the story in both a broad overview, discussing the planning among the upper echelon of generals, as well as from the foot soldier's point of view.  He uses numerous letters and other sources of quotes talking about how individual soldiers felt about what was going on around them.  Some of these quotes really get to the heart of what the soldiers were going through, and are quite graphic about what they have seen and heard.  The fear that some of them felt is almost palpable, and Atkinson really succeeds in setting the mood.<br />While this book is a comprehensive history of the North African campaign, one of the major themes of the book (hence the title) is the transformation of the American army from a green force to a tough fighting machine.  There are numerous passages in the book where Atkinson talks about the British feelings about this new upstart army, and how it would never amount to anything.  British Field Marshal Montgomery was very disdainful of it, saying that they didn't know how to fight and never would.  He would be proved wrong.<br />Atkinson's writing really draws the reader into the action.  He wastes no words, but he provides vivid descriptions of the action.  At times, he is quite graphic, talking about how a tank shell decapitated somebody or how a soldier is lying on the ground trying to keep his insides from falling out.  He sometimes falls into the trap of melodrama, though, such as on page 76 when he says:  \\"Far above, at the shrine of Notre Dame de Santa Cruz, a weathered stone madonna extended her hand toward the harbor, as if to offer absolution for all that she had witnessed.\\"  Lines like these are sprinkled throughout the text, and got a little annoying after awhile.  However, they don't detract from how successful Atkinson is in getting across to the reader what is happening.  He makes the book hard to put down.<br />The book is wonderfully researched.  There are 28 pages of sources listed, as well as 82 pages of notes.  It's obvious that Atkinson spent a lot of time and effort to make sure everything was correct, and I could find no fault in his research.  The one annoying thing is a personal feeling.  I hate the form of notation in this book.  The notes are confined to a section in the back of the book, and they have no numerical notation at all.  Instead, four or five words of the quote, or whatever it is that Atkinson is noting, are presented and then the source is given.  It makes it hard to go back and forth, though at least the page numbers are given so it is a bit easier to find them.  I hate flipping to the back of the book anyway, so consider me a fan of the footnote at the bottom of the page.  Again, that is a personal preference and doesn't detract from the quality of the book.<br />One other minor problem is the emphasis on the negative when Atkinson is talking about the morequiet times.  I consider it a plus that Atkinson pulls no punches and tells the reader about the bad things that happened during this time.  He's honest about the fact that the American fighting man, for the most part, was not ready for this war.  Many ran, or died due to the incompetence of their leaders.  He also talks about some valorous actions taken by the troops. However, when Atkinson talks about things taking place behind the lines, he tends to concentrate on the negative things.  He talks about the treatment of the Arabs, how some of the women were raped or brutalized in other ways.  That story does need to be told, but he never talks about any good things that the troops may have done.  I'm sure there must have been some good things that he could have talked about, such as an American soldier protecting a family or giving them some food, or something.  I'm not quite sure why he avoids this, but I did find that detracted from my enjoyment.<br />Overall, I have to heartily recommend this book to any serious history buff.  The North African campaign is one that has not been widely remembered as more than a footnote, where the American army faced its first trial by combat.  It's nice to see such a comprehensive work about it.  It is quite heavy (both literally and in the text), so be prepared.  But don't worry.  The text is rich enough that if you have any interest in the subject at all, it will be well worth your time.uiet times.

US	50332419	R1S5K6EOAGM7NK	0380818604	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	5	10	11	N	N	A royal curse and worse	The Curse of Chalion is Lois McMaster Bujold's second fantasy novel.  Known mostly for her science fiction Miles Vorkosigan series, she has rarely dabbled in fantasy.  I haven't read her first one, The Spirit Ring, but if this is any indication, I should run out and buy it immediately.  The Curse of Chalion is a wonderful tale, beautifully told with flare and style.<br />I've been a huge fan of the Vorkosigan series for a long time, and I think Bujold is one of the best writers out there.  It still took me a little bit of time to decide to try this book.  Am I glad I finally did, though.  The Curse of Chalion is a fantastic book.  Bujold shows her masterful characterization ability with a cast of unique and interesting people.  Cazaril is the ultimate reluctant hero.  He just wants to be left alone.  He wants to join the Provincara's household, under the radar of his enemies, and live out his life in peace.  When it's shown that destiny won't allow him this luxury, he tackles his job with resigned dedication.  He has a gentle sense of humour, and he has a very sweet romance with Betriz, the Royesse Iselle's lady in waiting.  When the three of them are together, conspiring or trying to decide what to do as events go from bad to worse, the dialogue is snappy and each of them bring their own point of view to the proceedings.  These are not cardboard characters.  The romance slowly grows, appearing one-sided at first, but Bujold slowly reveals that the feelings are mutual.  By this time, of course, Cazaril thinks he's going to be dead soon, so he tries hard to push her away.  I found the whole thing tragic and I really felt for them.<br />There are far too many characters to go into great detail of how individualistic they are, but let me talk about the villain for a minute.  In dy Jironal, Bujold creates a truly three-dimensional villain.  He has a lust for power, but he is also practical.  He works with Cazaril when he has to, and his plans are thought out well.  Cazaril and his compatriots are forced to actually out-think him rather than winning due to the villain's stupidity.  There aren't any \\"moustache-twirling moments,\\" though a couple of times in battle come close.  However, those can be attributed to the stress of the situation. I was really impressed with dy Jironal, and there was true tension in the situation.  Would Cazaril be able to defeat him?  Probably, but only because it doesn't seem like it will be a book with a downbeat ending.  But the doubt is always there, as dy Jironal maneuvers Cazaril into one desperate move after another.<br />The plot is very interesting as well.  Cazaril is fighting a war on two fronts.  He's trying to prevent dy Jironal from taking power by getting the Royesse's brother under his power for the inevitable time when the current ruler dies.  But this is only peripheral to the curse that's hanging over the Royesse's family.  Cazaril has to fight a war on both sides, as he tries to figure out a way to end the curse and still deprive dy Jironal of his ambitions. The plot has a sort of epic feel, in that Cazaril ends up journeying all over the land, but it is also a very intimate plot.  What it boils down to is that Cazaril must save a young woman for whom he has great respect and affection, as well as having romantic feelings for her assistant.  This sort of plot would not be very interesting if it wasn't for the characters, so it's imperative that Bujold populate her story with interesting people.  Thankfully, she does.<br />Finally, I have to compliment Bujold on her world-building.  It shouldn't surprise any readers of the Vorkosigan series that she creates a vivid, detailed world full of intriguing complications, people, lands and politics.  The political situation is very realistic, with some break-away provinces, neighbours who have to deal with their own insurrections and a nice combination of allies and enemies to Chalion.  The line of succession in Chalion is very realistically managed and the whole thing ties together nicely.<br />Where I must really compliment Bujold, though, is in the use of religion.  The world has five gods, The Mother, The Father, The Sister and the Brother, along with the ...  Some countries do not believe in the ..., though.  When someone dies, part of the funeral is to have a representative from each god come to the funeral, release its sacred animal, and see which animal will go to the deceased.  Whichever god's animal does this is the god who has taken the spirit of the deceased.  If no animals go to the corpse, then the spirit is doomed to wander the land, or something else has happened.  This becomes very important in the story, and is the first indication that Cazaril is going to have a lot more to deal with than he planned.  Bujold creates a very interesting religious system, and then makes it very important to the plot.<br />Ultimately, I can't recommend this book enough.  It dragged very slightly in the middle, but it's almost unnoticeable.  That's the only flaw I can pick out in this book.  If you're a fantasy fan, you really should pick this one up.  If you're a Vorkosigan fan but have been reluctant to try a Bujold that's not a Vorkosigan book, don't be.  Take the plunge and pick this one up.  You won't regret it.  Bujold's hit another home run.naged and the whole thing ties together nicely.<br />Where I must really compliment Bujold, though, is in the use of religion.

US	50332419	RL8N2OLO5CNRR	0765343401	841554209	The King's Name	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Keeping the peace	The King's Name is another excellent novel by Jo Walton.  This novel, sequel to The King's Peace, takes all of the strengths of its predecessor and leaves most of the weaknesses behind.  It's a worthy addition to any fantasy fan's bookshelf.<br />I thought that this book was marvelous.  Walton's characterization is wonderful, with the many different people populating this book having enough distinction that it isn't that hard to tell them apart.  There are, at times, difficulties in remembering which side some of the characters are on, but it's not a major issue and it becomes easier as you go along in the novel.  None of the minor characters are truly three-dimensional, but they all have some sort of hook that distinguishes them from the rest of the pack.  I really liked that aspect of it.<br />The characterization of the leads is another standout.  The tale is told in first person by Sulien, so everything is coloured by her interpretations.  She's a very deep character with some humour and a lot of loyalty to Urdo and her friends (as long as the friends aren't on the other side of the war).  She's very interesting to read about, and seeing her reactions to the events that are going on is what makes the book worth reading.  Her son, Darien, is widely believed to be the son of Urdo (though he's actually the son of Ulf, a Jarnsman warrior who raped her when she was much younger) and her reaction to hearing that Darien had been named by Urdo as his heir is great.  It was a bit jarring to see how easy her relationship with Darien was considering that The King's Peace didn't really end with the relationship being any warmer than it had been at the beginning.  But that quickly fell by the wayside as I got caught up in the story.<br />Urdo is the same wise king that he was in the first book as well.  There is an element of love and hero-worship in the book as far as he is concerned, mainly due to the point of view from which the book is told.  Her earlier rape completely destroyed any interest in sex and love as far as Sulien is concerned, but Urdo would have to be the closest she ever came to it.  Still, even with the rose-coloured glasses that the reader has to look at Urdo through, he still comes across as a kind, intelligent and determined king whose only wish is to keep the land together.<br />The villain of the piece, Morthu, is a decent one.  He's not the most complex character, with a lust for power that isn't totally explained, but he's still interesting.  He's shifty, devious, and very charming.  His lies are easily believed.  Walton does a good job of keeping the uncertainty in the question of whether or not Morthu is a sorcerer.  Does he have great magical powers or does he just have the same magic charms from the gods that everybody else seems to have?  I loved this aspect of it, and I also really enjoyed cheering against Morthu.  He was a very credible threat to everything, which not all fantasy books are able to manage.<br />The plot is also very intriguing and well told.  One of the bad things about the previous book was that the events spanned many years, so a lot of it was told in flashback by Sulien.  The King's Name doesn't have that problem, as it takes place in only a matter of weeks.  The previous book had a lot of ground to cover as Urdo worked to unite the land, but this one has only one campaign to worry about.  It's very tightly told and Walton doesn't waste any time or verbiage in the telling.  There is a lot of fighting, but the graphic descriptions of it are kept to a minimum (though there are some, so if you can't stand any, you may want to avoid this book).  Walton's style is very sparse, but it gets the job done.  There are times where the prose doesn't need to be wonderful, as long as the story is interesting.  This is one of those times, as I found the story so fascinating that I didn't care that the prose wasn't lovely.  I also really liked the fact that the book is told ostensibly as a history book, \\"from the writings of Sulien ap Gwien.\\"  There's even an introduction that \\"questions\\" whether or not the writing was really done by Sulien.  I thought that was a nice touch.<br />Again, as in The King's Peace, I loved the story's take on religion.  Many people are converting to \\"The White God\\" and \\"taking the pebble\\" to indicate this.  There are, however, many people who are happy with the gods they already had and continue to follow them.  All of the magic in the book is basically charms and prayers said in an attempt to reach the particular god the person prays to.  There's a bit more of a hands-on feel to these religious systems, and while the White God is never shown, the reader gets the sense that He's a bit more hands-on as well.  But the story never takes sides, and one of Urdo's main ideas for Tir Tanagiri is to allow the complete freedom of worship.  I found that to be very refreshing, as Walton never tries to elevate one religion over another.<br />If you are a fantasy fan, I think you will like this book.  It is better than the first, but you really should read the first one before this.  It's not necessary, however, as the introduction referred to above also does a good job of summarizing what happened.  Check it out.  I think you'll like it.ok, \\"from the writings of Sulien ap Gwien.\\"  There's even an introduction that \\"questions\\" whether or not the writing was really done by Sulien.

US	50332419	RUO2RSO4UKRH0	067103958X	189428573	The Badlands, Book 2 (Star Trek)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fun amongst the plasma storms	Book two of the Badlands Star Trek series by Susan Wright is a much better book then the first one.  The Badlands series consists of two books, each with two stories in them.  The first has stories with Captain Kirk's Enterprise and Captain Picard's Enterprise.  This book has a story for Voyager and the Deep Space Nine crew.  This one is quite an improvement in both the writing and the storytelling.<br />The first improvement from the previous book is that the writing seems much better.  I don't know if I had just gotten used to it, or if it actually improved, but I didn't get the feeling I was reading a young adult book in this one.  The prose seems much improved, which is strange considering the book was probably written at the same time as the first book.  Kudos to Wright for the improvement.  It really added to my enjoyment of this book.<br />The characterization is also good, if basic.  All of the characters we know and love from the two television series are on form in this one, with no major discrepancies as there was in the first book.  There are a couple of notable ones.  In the Voyager story, Wright adds a great deal of depth to Gul Evek, the Cardassian commander of the ship that gets disabled.  He appeared in a couple of episodes of the various Star Trek series, but didn't get a whole lot of characterization.  Wright adds a deepness to his character that I found really appealing.  He's a poet and the story behind the romance between him and his wife is very good.  Wright doesn't dwell on it too much, but when she does it's outstanding.  The second piece of characterization I really enjoyed was Commander Dax in the Deep Space Nine story.  In the television series she was always a bit flighty, a good and dedicated officer who didn't mind bringing a bit of fun to her job.  She was a bit of a flirt as well.  In this story, a Romulan officer is trying to drive a wedge between her and Commander Worf, her Klingon lover.  Dax goes along with it in her flirtatious way, not realizing what the Romulan is trying to do.  When it comes to light, her conversation with Worf is a great addition to her character.  It adds some dimension to their romance that wasn't always there in the television series.<br />The plot continues to be intriguing, and when Janeway discovers what is really going on in the Badlands, it all ties together nicely with what's been going on in the first two stories.  The book is a quick read and it certainly won't bore you.  There's enough conflict between the various crews and the people they're interacting with (the Cardassians for Voyager and the Romulans for Deep Space Nine) to keep things interesting, and when you discover what the Romulans are really after, the tension starts to mount, especially when Sisko and company are outmaneuvered.  The series is an intriguing look at an area of space mentioned quite often in the television series, and it was neat to find out more about it.<br />However, that does bring up one of the problems with the book, though you may not find it a problem.  When I read a Star Trek book, I try to keep in mind what has gone on around it in the Star Trek timeline of the television series.  This book, being slotted very deftly into some open spaces in that timeline, caused me to do it even more so.  However, it does jar me a little bit when something so big happens that, if the book were included \\"officially\\" in that timeline (the books are not recognized as official by the Star Trek TV producers, allowing them to ignore anything that happens in them as far as television continuity is concerned), they should be mentioned and it seems strange that they weren't.  In this case, all of the bad things that are happening in the Badlands really should have been mentioned in the episodes dealing with this area of space.<br />The second potential problem is that this book, even more than the first one, is only for the Star Trek fan.  The stories are slotted so perfectly between certain episodes of the television series (the Voyager story actually takes place within the series premiere episode) that part of the story is very incomplete if you don't know what happens.  In that series premiere, Voyager gets trapped by some cosmic rift and sent to the Delta Quadrant.  That is basically how this story ends, as Janeway solves the problem of the Badlands but is caught before she can do anything about it.  To the novice, it appears that this story ends completely unfinished.  The Deep Space Nine story doesn't have this problem as much, but there do appear to be unresolved plot lines in it as well if you don't know the series.  This isn't a problem for the fan, but new readers should be warned about this.<br />The final problem with the book is the offhand way Janeway solves the problem.  It seems almost completely arbitrary, as if Wright just didn't want to have Sisko both figure out what is going on and do something about it.  She has a sudden revelation about what must be going on, decides that must be the problem, and that's it.  It all takes place in the space of four paragraphs and just seemed very sudden to me.<br />Still, that doesn't take away from the quality of this book.  I found it a very enjoyable read, certainly better than the first book in the series.  If you keep the potential problems mentioned above in mind, you should have a quick, enjoyable read.  Just try not to grimace too much that you're paying for two books of about 260 pages each, which would have made one really neat book by themselves.sodes of the television series (the Voyager story actually takes place within the series premiere episode) that part of the story is very incomplete if you don't know what happens.

The concept of the Badlands isn't a bad one, an unknown and mysterious area of space where something is lurking, and all four of the Star Trek crews have to deal with it in their own time.  Something strange is lurking there, damaging ships and making the crew sick, and the different ships have to figure out whether it's something natural or something much more malevolent.  However, this first book just falls completely flat for me.<br />First of all, as a series, I think that Pocket Books' penchant for tying all four Trek series together in a book series, where they all interact with the same storyline, is starting to wear a little thin.  It's becoming a bit too unbelievable that they all interact with the same problem this many times, though this time Voyager isn't on the other side of the galaxy, which is a switch.  I realize that it's a marketing ploy to entice readers of all the various series, but I hope Pocket Books starts to tone this down a bit.  At least all of the other ancillary series aren't involved.<br />Secondly, it gets off to a bad start with this book.  The only book I have read of Susan Wright's is the Voyager book Violations, and I remember liking it a great deal.  This novel, however, seems written for a much younger level than I remember most Trek books being written.  The sentence structure seems very simplistic, and I just had a feeling I was reading a Young Adult book.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I did find it quite jarring.  Maybe I just wasn't ready for that.<br />The characterization seemed a bit off as well.  The most glaring example was Ensign Ro in the TNG story.  This story takes place directly after the TV episode that introduced her, \\"Ensign Ro.\\"  This episode established her as a hothead with a lot of rage seething inside her.  Even given that, though, I think Wright took her a little too far.  Ro is a Bajoran, a race of people who have been subjugated by the Cardassians for years.  When two Cardassians are brought on board, she has trouble dealing with that fact, exploding in a rage a couple of times.  However, for me, that doesn't jibe with the episode.  First, she acts like this even before the Cardassians come on board.  Secondly, she always struck me as somebody who seethes inside, and would refuse to let a Cardassian see that he is affecting her.  She seemed too explosive for me, and not the Ro I'm familiar with.<br />Finally, I think the stories suffer from feeling truncated.  I think both of them could have used a bit more story, almost as if they both deserved their own book.  I would not like the idea of this being a four book series, just because it would seem like more Pocket Books marketing.  However, the stories do suffer from being squeezed into two books.  The second story suffers from this more than the first one does.  Kirk's story could just use a couple of scenes of falling action, because as it is, the story just ends.  Obviously, one plot thread isn't finished because it has to be left for the subsequent stories to deal with.  However, the rest of it just comes to an abrupt halt, with one thread having been dealt with and another one just hanging there.<br />The TNG story, though, feels very unfinished.  In the plot thread that must continue for the next book, Data ends up making some scientific observations about it and that's about it.  Two Cardassians come on board, see the crew fall ill, decide that the Federation is full of weak people, and take some of their intelligence back to the Cardassian Union.  There is some resolution to the theme of the story, which is that one of the Cardassians has a fascination with Data as an artificial life form.  Data neatly turns the tables on him, and the Cardassian is left with much to think about.  It just seems like this story could have used some more meat to it.<br />One more complaint,and I'll make this a brief one.  Please, spare me the \\"Kirk's yeoman is really in love with him and oh, isn't he a wonderful captain, I can't let him see that I'm a weak person\\" schtick.  It got old in the original series, and it was particularly annoying here.  Even more annoying is that, once Wright includes it she doesn't do anything with it.  It almost seems like it's there just to make Kirk seem like an even more heroic figure.<br />I know this review consists of all negatives.  I did, however, enjoy the book, faults and all.  It is a quick read, which helps.  The stories themselves, truncated as they are, are interesting if you're a Trek fan.  I would certainly recommend that a Trek reader take a look at these, though I might suggest that you save your money and check them out from the library.  There are better Trek books out there, and this one is just a nice side story.and I'll make this a brief one.

Stealing the Elf-King's Roses is another great book by Diane Duane.  She is widely known as one of the best Star Trek novelists, but even non-fans of that series can enjoy her books.  This particular one has lyrical prose, interesting situations and an intriguing setting.  It all adds up to something that I'm very glad I read.<br />I've always been a Diane Duane fan, and when I saw this book, the premise really intrigued me.  This is a combination fantasy/science fiction book.  It has parallel worlds and some sort of psychic powers (though some may seem Lee's power as more magical than psychic), but it also has the Elves and the magical \\"glamour\\" of their world.  Elves make all the other races uncomfortable because they have what seems to be a magical, perfect beauty that has some sort of psychological effect on the other races.  There is actually a practical reason behind all of this which is addressed in the story in a very intriguing fashion.<br />Duane's world-building is marvelous.  There are numerous universes that share a lot of common traits, with other traits being completely different.  They all occupy the same space, just in a different world.  Travel and commerce between these worlds are commonplace and made possible by a substance called \\"fairy gold,\\" which powers the gates between the worlds, and  which the Elves control.  The two main worlds in the story, the first being Lee's world, a sort of modern-day setting with a few differences, such as different creatures wandering about, weird version of cars, communication implants and stuff like that.  The second world is Alfheim, home of the Elves, who are a very secretive race.  As the story unfolds, you see that they actually have a reason for being so secretive, but that things may have to change in order to avoid a calamity.  While Duane does a good job portraying the differences between Lee's world and our own, she really outdoes herself with Alfheim, making it a truly beautiful place with a strange veneer of unreality about it.  It's breathtaking, eerie and a place that you really like visiting.<br />While the book certainly has a great concept, Duane makes it more than that.  The characterization is simply wonderful.  Lee and Gelert's friendship is very touching but there's no hint of any romantic feelings between them.  He's happily married (or whatever the wolf-like equivalent would be in this world) and she's just coming off of a bad relationship.  But it's clear that they love each other as only good friends can.  They're willing to do whatever it takes to protect each other.  Gelert is even willing to do something that could easily be considered a suicide mission (and with his \\"wife's\\" insistence!) to save Lee.  The dialogue is great and Duane makes Gelert one of the most human wolves that you'll ever see.  There are times when you will lose track of the fact that he's a wolf because he sounds so human, but then he'll do something like drink his champagne from a dog dish or something like that.  He's that believable.  In fact, while I really liked Lee, I thought Gelert really stole the show and I'd love to read more about him.<br />The other characters are well-done also.  The Elf-King is suitably regal yet he's a \\"human\\" character as well, with understandable motivations and a wry sense of humour at times.  Most of the other characters don't have a great deal to do and are minor, but they all have some sort of hook that makes them just that much more than two-dimensional. The book is told from Lee's point of view, so all of the characters are coloured by her perception of them.  This gives some of them an extra dimension, such as Matt, who is her ex-boyfriend and their contact in the District Attorney's office.<br />I can't end the positives in this review without talking about the prose.  I just love Duane's writing.  It not only carries you deep within the story, but it also makes you feel like you're actually taking part.  The descriptions of Alfheim,as already stated, are just great.  The dialogue, especially between Gelert and Lee, is snappy and there's not a wasted word in the whole bunch.  I took forever to finish this book, mostly because I was just reveling in the language used.  Sometimes an actor is given a compliment by being described as \\"somebody you'd love to watch just read the phonebook.\\"  Well, Duane is somebody who I'd love to read the phonebook that she wrote.<br />The only negatives in this book are a couple of slow spots in the middle.  One spot is while we're waiting for the UN delegation to be formed to go to Alfheim and investigate some of the potential problems.  Another is some of the traveling that is done on Alfheim between two of the cities.  It almost seems like a lull in the action, and while the book is very interesting it's not action-packed.  It doesn't need these lulls.  In fact, there isn't a whole lot of action (such as fights, etc) in the book at all.  This doesn't stop Duane in the least, though.  She keeps increasing the tension until it's at the breaking point.  The climax of the book is simply marvelous, with Lee having to make a very tough decision that could affect everything in all the worlds connected by the gates.<br />I'm really torn here.  I love the fact that this book is completely self-contained, with no \\"to be continued\\" or anything like that.  I want this to be a stand-alone book.  On the other hand, I would love to see these characters again.  I have faith in Diane Duane that, if she's going to write a sequel, it will be just as good.  And if she doesn't, I am thankful to her that she's created this book.  Read it.  Experience it.  You won't regret it.m, as already stated, are just great.

US	50332419	R1S15JK5I2IOUX	0743405927	740288423	Immortal Coil (Star Trek: the Next Generation)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Artificial life takes over...	Immortal Coil is a Star Trek: The Next Generation novel about the android officer Data.  It ties together almost every episode of Star Trek (both the original series and the Next Generation) that has to do with androids and artificial intelligence.  It's a well-written book that drags in the middle and has a bit too much Star Trek continuity for my taste.  It's definitely worth the time and cost of reading it, though.<br />I'd heard wonderful things about this book, so when I saw it at the library, I snapped it up.  Data's always been one of the more interesting characters on Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG).  Quite a few books have been written about him, but this is the first one to take place during the times of the TNG movies, thus Data has his emotion chip.  This opens up many avenues for writers to explore.<br />Lang does a good job here.  All of the characters are definitely within the characters that fans know.  Riker is his usual lecherous self (he's extremely attracted to the new security chief), Troi gets some time as the counselor on the ship, trying to help Data navigate the rocky shores of his new emotions as they deal with grief, the first time he's had to do that.  Not only that, though, she gets some time as commander on the bridge during battle, testing her tactical abilities in a situation that we really haven't seen her in before.  These are just two examples, but all of the other main characters certainly shine in their scenes as well.<br />But the star of the show is Data, and Lang is wonderful with him.  He's completely torn between turning off his emotion chip because he can't deal with what it's giving him, and working his way through his grief like most humans do.  He also finds himself falling in love for the first time, making hunches where he usually deals only with facts, and generally not acting like the Data we're used to.  He's maturing and growing, doing things that he's not used to, and it's wonderful to see.  His relationship with McAdams is very touching, and even more so when he finds out her secret.<br />The original characters created by Lang are good as well.  McAdams is a real treasure, with a wonderful sense of humour as well as sense of duty.  Some of the tale is told in flashback, showing an expedition with Dr. Soong, Dr. Ira Graves, and Dr. Vaslovik.  These three characters are interesting people, and the reader doesn't miss the Enterprise characters during the flashback sections at all.  They are all well-realized, intriguing characters that you want to know more about.  The only character that isn't that great is Sam, as he seems completely uninteresting when you first meet him, and doesn't gain that much when you find out why he's really around.  He seems to be around just to play a role, rather than to make you care about him.<br />The plot of the book is very good, with twists and turns that keep you guessing.  When the truth is finally revealed, it all falls into place with no holes that I could see.  There are a couple of moments when I groaned at a bit of plot contrivance, such as how Riker and Barclay are saved from almost certain death.  However, these moments are few and far between, and most of them can be easily explained so it's not as cringe-worthy as they seem when they happen.  The story holds your attention during the investigation, and then explodes with tension as events start to overtake it.<br />One problem, though, is that this tension dissipates when things start to get explained.  Picard is told some of the history behind what happened, and Data lives some of it in a form of consciousness transference.  This grinds the book to a halt as a large part of the backstory is told in excruciating detail.  I don't know exactly how Lang could get around it, but it truly suffers from the \\"show, don't tell\\" philosophy.  There is way too much telling in during this sequence, and it becomes boring pretty fast.  Thankfully, once this part is over, the story picks upthe pace again and races to a very satisfying finish.  The ending, where Data and his new love have to part is very touching (and this is not a spoiler, because there is no way that Paramount, the owners of Star Trek, would ever allow something like a permanent love interest for one of the main characters to be established in the books, so you know that things have to end).<br />The other main problem with Immortal Coil, and I admit that this is a personal thing, so may not affect you at all, is the excessive amount of Star Trek continuity in this one.  Some of it is very necessary for the story that Lang wants to tell, but other references come at the expense of the story.  Sometimes, the reference has to be explained, which causes the story to stop as Lang explains it.  Others just make the reader stop for a moment, interrupting the flow of the story.  As I mentioned, every artificial intelligence episode of Star Trek is incorporated in some point in this story, and at times it's to the detriment of the story.  It's nice to have some sort of over-arching narrative linking all of these stories, but I think Lang could have left one or two out, and instead present something new.  Given all of this, though, Lang does a decent job with what he is given.<br />Overall, I would have to recommend this book.  The slow middle part and the overuse of continuity is what brings my rating down to four stars.  However, if you like continuity, this could easily be a 4.5 star book.  It is a fine example of a Star Trek novel, and is certainly worth a look.p the pace again and races to a very satisfying finish.

The Dark Glory War is an excellent example of a military fantasy novel.  There are lots of battles, lots of blood, heads flying off everywhere, and a large amount of tactics and strategy.  The question has to be: do you like this sort of thing?  My answer is yes, to an extent.  It almost becomes too much, but not quite.<br />This type of military fantasy isn't for everybody, and if graphic scenes of sword slashes, blood flying, limbs getting chopped off and other extremely violent scenes bother you, then you will not enjoy this book, even if I gave it 10 stars.  The book starts by introducing the four boys (Tarrant, Leigh, Rounce and Nay), three friends and a man (Nay) who becomes a friend as the temeryx fight brings them together.  They are asked to join a secret society that works beyond the politics of the various provinces.  I have to assume that this may have something to do with subsequent books, because even though the Order of the Phoenix is used slightly later on in the book, nothing much is done with them.  Another person who isn't used much, despite the fact that he gets name billing in the back cover blurb, is Rounce. He is the casualty in the temeryx attack, and while he lives, he takes no further part in the book and is gone by page 100.<br />Characterization takes a back seat to the plot in this one.  None of the characters are given much personality at all.  Tarrant, being the narrator (the book is told in first person), is the only one who has any sort of character at all.  The rest of the characters are given histories, taking part in the plot, but you don't really feel like you know them.  They are a collection of character traits (Leigh is brash and jumps into things without looking, Nay is a simple man with simple ambitions, but is loyal and a good fighter, etc).  Tarrant has a romance later in the book that, while not necessarily unbelievable, doesn't really fly off the page because his lover has the same problem as the other characters in the book.  They are almost character templates out of a role-playing game rather than characters, with mixed and matched traits put into their \\"personality column.\\"  Tarrant is well-explored.<br />Related to characterization is the fact that the enemies are completely faceless.  The only enemy who even gets a name is Chytrine, the \\"queen\\" of the north, and even she is completely evil.  She'd twirl her moustache if she had one.  The rest of the bad guys are hordes and hordes of gibberkin, temeryx (whatever the plural of that is), and three magical creatures that are the generals of the army, and who it takes a lot of magic to kill.  These hordes seem to have the same problem that some people who have seen the Lord of the Rings movies complain about:  they outnumber the good guys 100 to 1 and still can't do anything.  It does become a bit repetitive.<br />Finally, the book ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.  It is a complete book in itself, but the ending comes as a complete change of direction for Tarrant's life, and it will be interesting to see what happens to him in subsequent novels.  If you stop reading with this book, the immediate story will have an ending, so it's not quite as bad as if the story had just stopped.  Still, if this bothers you, then you will probably want to stay away from this book.  Personally, I will be checking out the next book, because the description makes it sound like it will be a bit different from this one.<br />You may notice that, even though I give the book four stars, I've been concentrating on the negatives.  That's mainly because this book is really only for people who like this sort of thing.  There's lots of blood, little characterization and not much of a plot except what links the battles together.  If that bothers you, then I'm sure you haven't even reached this far in the review.  But if you have, then let me tell you why I enjoyed it.  Nobody does this type of book like Stackpole.  He makes this stuff interesting, fun, and addsjust that little bit of pizzaz to the writing.  The battles flow like they were choreographed, and he goes into great detail (both the battles themselves, and the weapons involved as the soldiers get ready for battle).  Taken in small doses, this is what military fantasy is all about.  It moves quickly, is a fun read, and has that game-like feel that can be enjoyable on occasion.<br />I hope that the next book is a little different.  From the descriptions, it sounds a little more low-key.  Even so, I have taken a break before looking it up.  I have a feeling that too much of this at one time may be hazardous to my health.  I know it would be hazardous to my enjoyment of the series.  If you like this stuff, then you can't go wrong reading this one.just that little bit of pizzaz to the writing.

US	50332419	R63UCN9W7UCDB	0743418522	837421511	Demons of Air and Darkness: Gateways #4 (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - Gateways)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	What if you could go anywhere in the galaxy with one step?	Demons of Air and Darkness is another adventure in the continuing saga of Star Trek: Deep Space 9.  After the TV series ended, Pocket Books decided to continue the adventures of the station and some of its crew (other crewmembers had moved on in the final episode).  The first two books (Avatar books one and two) were a wonderful beginning.  I haven't read Section 31: Abyss yet, but I found this one in the library and decided to check it out.  While not being as good as Avatar, it's still up there.  It's well written, with just a bit too much Trek continuity for my taste to mar the quality.<br /><br />Sounds a bit convoluted, doesn't it?  Thankfully, Candido does a good job of juggling all of the different storylines.  First, I should tell you that this book is actually Book 4 in the Gateways 7-part series that goes through all of the Trek book series.  However, you do not need to have read any of the other books to know what's going on.  All of the books are designed to stand on their own two feet, and this one does, except that you have to read book 7 to find out what ultimately happens to Kira.  That was a bit annoying, since I now have to track that book down.  But it is manageable.<br /><br />Overall, this is another winner in the DS9 series.  The characters are well-defined, with all of them getting their moment in the spotlight.  The cool thing about a continuing series is that the characterization can be carried through subsequent books, and this one is no exception.  Ever since Avatar, we have known that there is some tension between Ensign ch'Thane and his \\"mother\\" (for lack of a better term).  This storyline is touched upon in this novel as well.  Ch'Thane is a very interesting character, and the Andorian race (which ch'Thane is one) is fleshed out from what we have seen in the TV series.  Evidently, the race is dying out, and his mother is very upset that he won't come home and start a family on Andor.  He is, however, very happy in Starfleet and has no desire to go home.  It doesn't make matters any easier that she is on the Federation council.  It is all very interestingly done, and I look forward to further exploration of this fascinating species.<br /><br />The bad thing, of course, about continuing series is that the characterization can be carried through to subsequent books.  Thankfully, this doesn't become a problem in this one.  The previous book was about Doctor Bashir and involved the Jem'Hadar named Taran'atar.  He evidently learned a lot about humans and the Federation in that book, but anything important is summarized in this book, so it's not a problem.  He's also an interesting character given a lot to do, especially when he joins Kira in the Delta Quadrant.  He ends up getting into the fight of his life.  Candido portrays all of this well, including the inner conflict that Taran'atar has during the fight.  He is torn between protecting Kira and the joy of conflict.  It was nice having the needed information from Abyss given in this one, so you don't have to track down the other one unless you truly want to.<br />The rest of the characters are excellently done as well.  The writers and editors of this series have taken some of the best characters from the TV show, expanded on their characters, and added a host of new characters who you like to read about.  The cast is perfectly done, and I can honestly say that there isn't a boring person in the bunch (though Dax comes close).  Each person gets some good \\"screen time\\" in this novel, with only Ro Laren getting short shrift in the beginning (though she makes up for it in the end).  They are all three-dimensional, and play their parts to the hilt.<br /><br />Candido handles the multiple storylines very well.  He cuts away at just the right moments, making all of the disparate stories interesting.  You are never reading one section and saying to yourself \\"I wish he'd leave these losers and go back to Kira\\" or something like that.  The only shortfall in this book is the abundance of continuity references to previous Trek television shows.  I suppose that's par for the course in a sub-series of books which is about something that comes out of the TV series (like the Gateways concept is), but it still started to become annoying.  There were references to many of the televised episodes, some of them that didn't really need referencing.  Gul Macet from one of the Next Generation episodes, is in the book for no real reason, as it could have been any other Cardassian.  At times, the book makes the Star Trek universe seem very small, though it's not nearly as bad as some other Trek books.<br /><br />Still, if that's the only strike against this book, that's saying a lot.  I'm really enjoying these post-television Deep Space 9 stories, and I plan on tracking down as many of them as I can.  With an interesting cast of characters, intriguing plots and an ongoing storyline, you can't go wrong.  Demons of Air and Darkness is yet another winner.<br /><br />David Royity references to previous Trek television shows.

At times, the book makes the Star Trek universe seem very small, though it's not nearly as bad as some other Trek books.    Still, if that's the only strike against this book, that's saying a lot.  I'm really enjoying these post-television Deep Space 9 stories, and I plan on tracking down as many of them as I can.  With an interesting cast of characters, intriguing plots and an ongoing storyline, you can't go wrong.  Demons of Air and Darkness is yet another winner.     David Roy	2003-01-18

Joe Queenan is a cynical b*stard.  No, that's not an insult, and he probably wouldn't take it as such.  In fact, he'd probably revel in it and tell me to keep up the good work.  Queenan used to write for Movieline magazine and, for me at least, was the only thing worth reading in there.  Confessions of a Cineplex Heckler: Celluloid Tirades and Escapades is a collection of some of these articles. As long as you don't mind raw language and (usually) snarky comments about movies and movie stars, you won't find a funnier book of entertainment essays around.  I had to read parts of this book out loud to my wife (who has already read it, but so long ago that she doesn't remember details) because I had to talk about them to somebody.<br />This was my first exposure to Queenan (at my wife's urging) and I can definitely say I'm going to track down the rest of his books.  He has a self-admittedly bad attitude which doesn't really suit every reader, but makes me laugh and giggle endlessly at what he says. The title article, where he goes to certain movies and heckles them loudly to see how long it will take before other movie-goers will do something other than say \\"shhhhhh!\\" works on two levels: it shows what a complete a** he can be, but it also shows how passive a society we have become.  He went to ten films and shouted things at the screen or at audience members who politely asked him to be quiet (such as \\"The movie's in Greek, pal.  Potato chips can't drown out subtitles\\")  In only one of these movies was he thrown out, and most of the other time, people either just tried to ignore him or basically just said \\"shhhh!\\"  Very rarely did anybody actually do anything about it.<br />That's one of the great things about Queenan.  Sometimes, behind all the cynicism and general bad behaviour, there's a point to his articles.  There's a wonderful article on Spike Lee in here, where Queenan not only interviews him, but comments on the interview too.  Queenan doesn't ask the soft, simple questions but instead asks Lee things about the craft of his movies, even criticizing a bit and asking him to respond (like asking him about the long, drawn out endings to his movies).  He comments in the article about how good he thinks Lee is, despite some of the problems in his films.  Some see the article as tearing down Lee, but I saw a lot of respect underneath the smart-a** questions, questions that say \\"I like your movies, but couldn't they be better if you do [fill in the blank]?\\"  Of course, he does end the article with a note written since the article was published, saying that he would think that, after Lee heckled Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers in a playoff game, inspiring him to 50+ points and the win, that the New York Knicks would have \\"kicked his scrawny a**.  No such luck.\\"  But again, I think that's his good-natured cynicism.<br />There are plenty of other hilarious articles in this wonderful book, and only a couple of clunkers.  Some of the great articles are:  the first \\"Don't do this at home\\" where he tries to enact certain movie scenes to see if they are at all realistic, an article on Irish films and their cliches, an article about the suddenly common practice of ear mutilation in films, Antonio Banderas and why he keeps getting pushed down our throats as \\"the newest star\\" though his movies keep bombing, bad hair in films, and too many more to mention unless I just do a list, which would get boring really fast.<br />There are a couple of skippable ones in this book, though.  \\"For Members Only,\\" an article about the mutilation of male genitalia in movies, is kind of boring.  An article about how he became a crusader against sitting through bad films, and started reimbursing customers who went to see them falls a little flat.  And the article on his foray into watching just foreign films and how he discovers they are the same horrible stuff that Hollywood is putting out, while mildly interesting, lacks some of the zing of his other articles.  Unfortunately, the book ends on a lackluster note with another \\"Don't Try This at Home\\" article that's nowhere near as good as the first one in the book.<br />Still, if you like cynical humour, can put up with foul language and wondering if there is a movie in the world that Queenan likes (he does compliment quite a few films, though some of those compliments are sort of back-handed), then you will love this book.  Queenan has quite the way with words, and as long as his style doesn't turn you off, he's a great writer.  Some of the articles talked about movies I'd never heard of, but I didn't care.  His writing made the article worthwhile.  Personally, I'm going to be tracking down all of his other books and giving them a try as well.articles.

At 154 pages, it's not very substantive.  Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't a quality book.  However, in this case, I'm sorry to say that Terry Pratchett dropped the ball a little bit.  It's another Rincewind adventure, and like most of the other Rincewind books that I've read, it fails for the most part to entertain.<br />I've never been a fan of Rincewind or his luggage, which I know makes me unusual for a Discworld fan.  Unfortunately, Eric continues the trend of sub-par Discworld adventures featuring the incompetent wizard.  I just didn't find it that interesting or funny, and the main saving grace is that it's short.  If it had been longer, I think my rating would have been less.  The idea is clever, a parody of Faust with Rincewind unable to fulfill any of the functions that the devil does in the original play.  The execution of it isn't even that bad, though it's not up to Pratchett's usual standards.<br />I guess my main problem with it is that Rincewind seems even a lesser part of things than he usually does.  The luggage saves his bacon a couple of times, and the other times things just happen and outside forces end up dealing with things.  I think he actually solves a problem himself once in the whole book.  The concept of an observer who would rather be sitting home bored than actually taking part in all of these adventures may be a good one, but I don't find it very interesting.  Because of that, Pratchett has to make the situation worth my while in order for me to like the book.  Eric doesn't do that.  There are amusing bits here and there, a wry comment or a funny situation, but as a whole it doesn't work for me.<br />Once again, Death gets the best part of the book, and he's only in it for two scenes.  The part at the beginning of the book where the wizards attempt to call forth Death to tell them what's going on is hilarious, with it not working quite as the wizards planned.  He always seems to get the best lines in any Discworld book.  There are a few other parts of the book where I actually laughed (like where Rincewind becomes a living part of history by tripping over something and setting the city on fire), but the overall affect, for me anyway, was \\"ho-hum.\\"<br />The thing that brings this book up to 3 stars, though, is the rendition of Hell that Pratchett has. Astfgl has made hell a boring place rather than a fiery place, because he's realized that souls can't really feel any pain, so eternal physical torment really isn't that bad when the soul can't feel anything.  So he makes it intensely boring instead, with people chained to rocks and forced to listen to stories of hernia operations and vacations on the various circles of Hell.  I found this idea very inspired, and had to laugh at quite a few of the bits here.  I don't want to ruin any of the jokes here, since they were most of the funny ones in the book, but suffice it to say that Hell was the best part of the book, and the only real saving grace.<br />The book's ending, though, is as uninspired as the rest of the book.  It's a bit anti-climactic and not very well-done.  Once again, Rincewind is saved by the actions of outside forces (not even the luggage saves him this time) and things start looking up for him again.  Pratchett gives a rundown of what's happened to the various places that Rincewind and Eric have visited, but even that is only mildly amusing and not up to Pratchett's normal standards.<br />I know there are fans of Rincewind out there.  I've read a few reviews, and even they think that this is one of Pratchett's weaker efforts.  If you're a fan of his, you may enjoy this book, though I would suggest checking it out from the library rather than buying it.  If you're not a fan of his, than you may want to skip this one (unless you're like me, and want to read every Discworld book out there).  Thankfully, it's short, so you won't spend too much of your life with this one.with this one.	2003-01-13
US	50332419	R2PY083JFX5URY	0441009166	27938824	Dragon Bones (The Hurog Duology, Book 1)	Books	4	53	61	N	N	Bones beneath the keep	Dragon Bones is a nice, light little fantasy.  It's short, relatively self-contained (a sequel just came out, but this book does stand by itself nicely) book that goes down smooth and easy, though it doesn't really have much body.  I enjoyed it and it has a really nice climax (though the ending is a bit of a cheat).  It just didn't really seem to mean much.<br /><br />The first thing I'll address is the ending, because it's really the only thing that's wrong with an otherwise very interesting plot.  The climax was exciting, with Ward having to make a decision that really builds his character.  I was beginning to wonder how Briggs was going to end the book, and thought that maybe it would be a typical cliffhanger, making the reader wait until the next book to find out what happens.  But then I found out I was wrong, and I was so pleased.  I love it when characters have to make hard decisions.  The bad thing is, though, subsequent events make it so that the decision ultimately doesn't mean anything, and it's robbed of most of its drama.  Sure, the fact that he had to make the decision is character-building, and I'm glad Briggs didn't take the decision out of his hands, like sometimes happens.  The problem is that Ward is saved from the consequences of his actions, and I was a bit sorry to see that.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a very good novel.  It won't take very long to read, as it's very light.  It's not very filling, though.  There's plenty of action, which is nice.  Swords flash, arrows fly, and the bad guys die.  It's quite an exciting book, once it gets going.  It just doesn't seem to have a lot of substance.  It's a snack, almost.  It's well-written, with very good prose and an air-tight plot.  You definitely won't go wrong by picking this up and spending an afternoon with it.<br /><br />The characterizations are very well done, with only Kariarn being the two-dimensional villain.  A few figures at the beginning of the book start out looking like stereotypical bad guys too, but they develop a depth to them when Briggs writes from their point of view (the book is mostly in first person from Ward's point of view, but there are sections of the book written from others' point of view that were told to Ward after the fact).  Ward's cousins, Beckram and Erdrick, start out as typical tormentors of both Ward and his sister.  Garranon and his brother Landislaw are the men who come to take Ward away to the insane asylum after Ward won't produce Landislaw's slave.  However, we find out that Garranon is the enforced lover of the king who just wants freedom for his people.  Landislaw disappears from the story, so he doesn't get much characterization, but the others are very well-rounded by events.  We find out that they are just doing what they have to do in order to get by in a crazy world under a cruel and sadistic king.  It's nice to see characters get this kind of treatment, rather than becoming complete stereotypes.<br /><br />Ward, the main character, is very interesting as well.  He's played a role for so much of his life that he doesn't know where the real Ward is anymore.  He's always fantasized about being his ancestor (the one who killed the dragon, though he doesn't find that out until this book), a great hero in all of the stories.  When he sets out to prove himself, that's what he sees himself becoming.  Ward has to learn through what happens in this novel to be his own person and a good leader.  He is devastated when he finds out that his ancestor killed the dragon, and that his ancestor is the one who brought the curse down on his family that has made it what it is today.  He has to work through all of that, and it makes for a very interesting character arc.  He's a very good storyteller, and I'm glad Briggs decided to write this book in first person.  It adds a sense of immediacy to the actions, and makes some of the choices he makes that much more intriguing.<br /><br />The other characters fulfill their roles well, though there really isn't a lot to them.  Tosten, Ward's formerly suicidal brother, isn't very interesting.  He sulks when he thinks that Ward likes Oreg better than him (not knowing what Oreg really is).  He does what he needs to do, but doesn't really distinguish himself.  Oreg is a child and most of the time acts like one.  The rest of them are fairly nondescript.  They're certainly not badly done, they're just there.<br /><br />The book is well worth a read, though. I did really enjoy it.  I will definitely look up the sequel and see if it's as good.

Discworld novel by Terry Pratchett, is a wonderful character study of Samuel Vimes, the head of the City Watch of Ankh-Morpork.  In this one, Pratchett turns kind of serious, though there are some amusing bits.  Unlike Small Gods, it appears to work in this one.  Maybe I just wasn't ready for it before.  Or maybe Vimes is such an interesting character that I was willing to forgive.  Whichever way it is, Night Watch is yet another masterpiece from Pratchett.<br />Carcer is one of Pratchett's best villains, I believe, because he's \\"normal.\\"  Yes, he's insane, but he could very well live in the world we live in, unlike some of Pratchett's other bad guys.  Not to say that they weren't good as well, but Carcer adds that extra bit of chill.  He's a survivor, able to adapt to many different situations.  It takes some time for Vimes to adapt himself to what he has to do once he discovers what has happened.  Even when the Monks of History (the main source of any humour in this book) tell him what he must do, he is still reluctant.  Carcer, on the other hand, jumps in with both feet, ingratiating himself with the higher-ups, and starts establishing himself.  Once he realizes what the situation is with Vimes (and the younger Vimes) it gets even chillier.  He's very effective, and the reader is often left wondering just how Vimes can beat him.<br />This book, however, is Sam Vimes' book.  I've always found Vimes to be a fascinating character, throughout all of the City Watch books, and this book just builds on those.  Every City Watch book is really about the development of Vimes, and Night Watch takes it to the next level, with an in depth character study, where you get under his skin and find out what makes him tick.  When he's taken out of his element and dumped back in time, he has nothing to go on but his copper instincts.  Times may change, politics may change, but coppers are coppers, and they just have to do what is right.  Catch the bad guys, keep the peace.  He sees himself as an extraordinarily simple man, and in a way, he is.  But he's very dedicated to what he does, very strongly determined to do what's right, no matter what the consequences.  When rebellion is flourishing all over the city, and the Unmentionables (the current government's secret police) is fomenting even more, Vimes is determined to make sure it doesn't reach the area of the Watch house.  He uses some very unorthodox methods to make sure this happens, which doesn't put him on the good side of the Unmentionables (especially a new member, who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere).  Vimes continues to show his intelligence, as well as his moralistic thinking.  He's put through the ringer in this one, and a very interesting character throughout the previous books becomes a fascinating one instead.<br />The relationship between him (as John Keel) and the young Sam is a joy to watch.  The young Sam is very impressionable.  He wants to do the right thing, but he doesn't really know what that is.  He took part in the round-ups of curfew-breakers (and delivering them to the Unmentionables) only because he didn't know any different.  When Vimes arrives and sees what Sam is in danger of becoming, memories flood over him, and he becomes determined to ensure that Sam becomes what Vimes is.  He also tries desperately to keep him out of danger, because he has to keep history going along the path it did before.  The relationship is wonderful, and really aids in fleshing out the character of Vimes that we all know and love.<br />The plot is very interesting as well.  Rebellion against the current Patrician of Ankh-Morpork is hitting the city all over the place.  It is touching to watch the tragic inevitability of what happens, knowing that as much as Vimes tries, he really has to ensure that history repeats itself.  The Lilac rebellion must occur in some fashion, and some good people, who he is getting to know again, are going to die.Carcer is going to do his best to make Vimes' life miserable, and if that involves changing history, too bad.<br />Pratchett ties everything together nicely into a tight plot with no holes that I could see.  The story contains some interesting time travel theories, wonderful writing by Pratchett, and interesting characters.  Fans of the series will be glad to see that not only are the Watch back (though they are only there in the present-day sequences), but also the Wizards play a small role.  The Monks of History are around, trying to make sure that History is not damaged too badly by what is going on.  Also, we get some history on Nobby Nobs, Sergeant Colon, Reg Shoe, Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler and we find out a very interesting aspect of the current Patrician, Vetinari.  I've noticed that in recent books, Pratchett picks and chooses characters from his series to throw together into a book, and I think it really works.<br />But make no mistake.  This book is about Samuel Vimes.  He carries the book on his shoulders, and he does it very well.  I wasn't sure if Pratchett could do much more with Vimes other than just another \\"adventure of the City Watch,\\" but Pratchett proved me wrong.  In spades.  This is a wonderful book.  While it's certainly readable as a first Discworld book, it loses a lot of its impact that way, so I would not recommend starting here.  Get some background, then come back to this one.  It's a keeper.Carcer is going to do his best to make Vimes' life miserable, and if that involves changing history, too bad.  <br />Pratchett ties everything together nicely into a tight plot with no holes that I could see.

US	50332419	R12USSYYL66OJU	0671038850	757593145	A Stitch in Time (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine #27)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	The tailor says it all	A Stitch in Time, by Andrew Robinson, is an examination of character and history of Garak, the Cardassian tailor that Robinson portrayed on the TV series, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9).  Usually, it's not a good thing when an actor writes a book about his character, and a lot of times they need some help.  First, it definitely is a good thing this time, and secondly, he doesn't appear to have needed any help.  This is a standout Star Trek book, and a sterling example of what these books should be.<br />Garak was always one of my favourite characters on the television show, and when I heard that Andrew Robinson had written a book about him, I knew I had to read it.  Garak is a very mysterious figure in the show, and I was dying to know more about him.  He also turned into a sort of tragic figure as the Dominion War went on, knowing what the war was doing to his people, but since he was in exile, he couldn't do much about it, other than helping the Federation win the war.  As this book begins, Garak is back on Cardassia, helping to clean up the mess.  It's interesting to see how the character has progressed since the end of the series, to see that some of Dr. Bashir's principles have rubbed off on him a little bit.<br />Still, it's written by an actor, so it can't possibly be good, can it?  Actually, it is quite well-written.  It's certainly not award-winning material, but the plot is interesting, the prose is fairly well-done and the characterization is wonderful.  I could have done without the cliched romance in Garak's history, but then again he has always carried himself as a sort of romantic figure (though he never did actually have one in the show) so it can be excused.  Robinson not only gets Garak right, but he also gets the other DS9 characters as well.  The storyline that takes place during the last year of the war showcases this, especially his take on Dr. Bashir.  Many fans of the show complained that Bashir and Garak's relationship grew very distant toward the end of the show.  This book gives a good reason for that.  It also effectively shows how that friendship is still there, when Bashir has to work past his uneasiness to get Garak to confront what is bothering him.  Robinson nails the characterization of Bashir in these scenes, and we get a return of the wonderful repartee between these two characters.  It made me sorely miss the television show.<br />The new characters are also very well-done.  The Cardassians are appropriately militaristic, even Garak's love interest (though she is softened a bit compared to the others).  Cardassia has a brutal society, and Robinson portrays it well.  The Cardassians in the present are also fine, with a nice mixture of Cardassians set in their ways and Cardassians who want to use the devastation to chart a new path for Cardassia.  Dr. Parmak is a wonderful example of this \\"New Cardassia,\\" as he's almost kind and gentle compared to the others.  Robinson draws a nice contrast between him and some of the more militaristic sorts that surround Garak.<br />The three different storylines are tied together nicely thematically, as well as being effectively told in their own right.  It's easy to follow in the book, as each storyline has its own style.  The \\"current\\" storyline is told regularly, the \\"last year\\" storyline is in a different typeface, and the \\"Garak's history\\" storyline is told in a series of journal entries, so there's never any confusion.  The only snag that I can see in any of them is a slight implausibility at the end of his historical journal, where he talks about being abandoned on DS9 by the other Cardassians.  Before the Federation took over the running of the station, it was a Cardassian outpost that Garak was assigned to.  When the Federation took over, the Cardassians left in the dead of night.  Garak slept through the whole thing and when he wakes up, he finds everybody gone and the Federation moving in.  Especially considering the destruction that the Cardassians left behind, I find it hard to believe that Garak didn't wake up during all of that.<br />Still, that's a small thing, and it doesn't take away from how wonderful this novel is for a Star Trek novel.  In fact, unlike a lot of Trek novels, I don't think you have to be a fan to necessarily enjoy this book.  It will certainly help, as you will have a lot more invested in the book if you are a fan, but it's certainly readable and understandable by a non-fan.  Give it a try.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />Garak, it was nice to see you again.ssians left behind, I find it hard to believe that Garak didn't wake up during all of that.<br />Still, that's a small thing, and it doesn't take away from how wonderful this novel is for a Star Trek novel.

The title of the book makes it obvious that this is a tongue in cheek book, and David delivers very nicely.  It's not as good as the first book, but it is definitely a worthy successor to it.  Only a weak middle part of the book mars what otherwise is a funny and interesting take on the fantasy genre.<br />Apropos is not your typical fantasy hero.  He's self-centered, always looking after his own interests before others'.  That's what I've always loved about Peter David's writing: he always does the unusual.  I wouldn't want to read about this type of character all the time, but it is a nice change of pace.  In The Woad to Wuin, David takes Apropos on a journey of discovery, as he finds the depths of his self-centeredness, as well as what little moral sense he has.  It's an interesting relationship the he builds with Sharee, as they are companions of necessity more than anything else.  They don't really like each other much, but they are both outcasts and so share a certain kinship.  Deep down, though, there seems to be a grudging respect between them, despite their animosity.  Apropos saves her life a few times when he knows that it involves risking his life.  When his men capture her, he goes out of way, risking his power, to try and set her free.  He constantly regrets these actions, however, when she continually spurns his help because she knows the type of man he really is.  I found watching the two of them fascinating, and thought the book lost a little during the sequences when she wasn't there.<br />The other characters in the book are interesting as well.  There aren't that many, really, but all of them are well-rounded with intriguing bits about them.  There's Kate, Apropos' lover while he's the Peacelord.  She seems like just a stereotypical ditzy blonde, but she has a hidden depth to her that's revealed in time.  Warlord Beliquose is aptly named, as he speaks in nothing but shouts, the volume of his voice shaking everything around him.  All of his conversation is in capital letters, which anybody who is familiar with the Internet already knows is considered shouting.  The men in Apropos' army aren't quite as well done, but even they have one or two little quirks that make them interesting.  The most fascinating of them all, though, is Bicce, the hound (part woman, part creature) who Beliquose uses to track them.  Even though she is mostly a beast, she has a certain nobility about her, especially toward the end of the book where she turns into something you don't really expect.  I found her the most intriguing of the minor characters, and David does a good job in portraying her.<br />The plot is also fairly interesting, though it desperately drags in the middle.  When Apropos wakes up, you spend a lot of time wondering along with him about what has happened to him.  Then he starts doing some horrible, nasty things.  While he does suffer attacks of conscience, it is still very jarring for the \\"hero\\" of the book to be doing all of this.  It can get a bit unpleasant, actually.  Then, as this goes on and on, it starts to get rather boring.  There's still the mystery there, and Apropos slowly learns some things about himself, so it's still valuable, but it's not very interesting.  It's not that the section can just be excised, though, as it's very important to the development of the plot.  It's just a slog to get through, as it's not very interestingly told. Things start to pick up again as things are finally revealed and you find out what's really going on.  Suddenly, the book explodes into a breakneck pace with revelations occurring right and left and the book gets exceptionally good again.<br />It's a shame that the book is disjointed in this fashion.  I really struggled to get through the middle part of the book, and that's not something that usually happens with David's writing.  With this exception, the book is a wonderful exploration of a self-centered character who has had nothing but hard knocks in life.  He is the product of the rape of his mother and his mother is then killed by somebody else who was also in the process of raping her.  He does find some information in this book about who that person may have been, but it's left unclear whether or not this is a symptom of the alleged perpetrator's madness or if it's really true.<br />I want to read more about Apropos, and I can't wait for the next book.  I hope we learn more about what happened with his mother and the person who allegedly killed her.  I just hope that it's a bit better than this one was.exploration of a self-centered character who has had nothing but hard knocks in life.

US	50332419	R2FWZOLMRNMEEY	0553575384	291987598	To Say Nothing of the Dog	Books	5	2	5	N	N	What time is it?	&lt;b&gt;To Say Nothing of the Dog&lt;/b&gt;, by Connie Willis, is a Victorian time travel romp with some touching moments as well.  This is my first Willis, and it's very different from what I've been led to expect from her.  That's why it took me a little time to really get into it, because I was expecting a science fiction opus.  Instead, I got a comedy of Victorian manners with heavy doses of Chaos Theory thrown in.  It was definitely worth getting into, though, as it's a very enjoyable book in its own right.<br />I greatly enjoyed this book.  I wasn't really expecting to, though.  I picked this up on the strength of Willis' name, but it seemed so different from what I was expecting that I almost put it down.  After finishing it, I was glad I didn't.  I laughed out loud quite a few times, and had to restrain myself a few other times as I was in a public place.  Willis did a good job of showing the hilarious tension between our 21st century heroes and the cultural traits of the late 1800s.  Ned sees a straight razor used for shaving, and thinks that he's going decapitate himself trying to use it.  They see the courtship rituals of high society, so vastly different from their own time (and even ours!), and they can't believe them.  Once they get involved with the Mering family, things move at a comic pace that is breathtaking.  Even before that, though, things are wonderfully timed.  Ned's boat ride down the Thames with Terence, Professor Peddick almost literally falling into their laps as they row, the Professor's obsessions with history (as well as his ongoing argument with Professor Overforce about historical forces versus the individual in the study of history).  All of these subjects are addressed in a wonderfully comic manner by Willis.<br />The main characters are wonderfully drawn by Willis.  Ned is so time lagged that he doesn't know if he's understanding anything correctly, as well as getting overly sentimental about everything (that's one of the effects of time lag).  He doesn't know whether he's so drawn to Verity because of the lag or because she truly is the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.  He tries very hard not to let Verity know how he feels, just in case it is the effects of the lag.  He's a very dedicated man, who's willing to do anything to get the job done.  He's very bright and interesting to read about.  Verity is not a viewpoint character, but you see enough of her through Ned's eyes that you know she's intelligent, even though she's fairly new to this time travel business.  She's a quick thinker, though, which makes getting the job done easier.  She's definitely Ned's equal, and has many good ideas of her own.  The small love story that develops between them is a nice parallel with the romantic ideals of the Victorian era.<br />The Victorian characters are just hilarious.  The Mering women (Tessie and her mother), are very heavily into the spirit world with very funny results (the s&eacute;ance that takes place at the Mering home where Ned and Verity have to out-charlatan the mystic results in at least four pages of utter hilarity).  Mr. Mering is a stodgy old colonel who believes that it's all a bunch of hooey.  Terence, the besotted Victorian man who has fallen in love at first sight with Tessie.  Professor Peddick, the eccentric history professor who's always going on about his fight with Overforce, even Baine the butler and Jane the maid.  All of these characters are wonderfully done, not quite three dimensional but definitely fulfilling their roles with wit and humour.<br />The plot is very straightforward, but filled with complications that make it interesting.  The bird stump makes a nice macguffin, driving the plot forward while not being seen until the end, in a truly surprising manner.  Chaos Theory is discussed all the way through this book, and it can get a bit heavy with it at times, but it doesn't prove too distracting and if you don't like that sort of thing, you can skim those parts.  There is a lot of repetition for affect, with the characters constantly referring back to the Battle of Waterloo, and what might have happened if some seemingly insignificant change had occurred.  Peddick's argument with Overforce about the affects of individuals on history, versus the inevitable forces that drive history and minimize the impact of individuals, makes a nice parallel with the actual events in the book.  This argument gives the narrative a lot of its drive and makes an intriguing philosophical question in its own right.  Can we as individuals affect events, or are we just carried along like a bit of flotsam in a raging river?<br />The nice thing about &lt;b&gt;To Say Nothing of the Dog&lt;/b&gt; is that you can read it on either level, or even both.  If all you want is a nice Victorian comedy, you can read it as such.  You may have to skim a lot of the theory as it presents itself, but it can be done.  If you like heavy science fiction, though, with discussions of history and Chaos Theory, you can read it for that too.  It becomes a truly fascinating book in that light, and I think Willis does a great job in sugarcoating it for the masses to be able to swallow.<br />If you don't like science fiction, this book will probably be too heavy for you, even though it is a comedy.  But if you're a science fiction fan in need of a little humour to brighten your day, you can't go wrong with this one.There is a lot of repetition for affect, with the characters constantly referring back to the Battle of Waterloo, and what might have happened if some seemingly insignificant change had occurred.

US	50332419	RUZOKWTLQ7FA1	0380979055	431563792	The Visitor	Books	3	38	39	N	N	Bringing the world back into light	The Visitor, by Shari S. Tepper, is a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel set 700+ years after a giant object slams into Earth.  I've heard many good things about Tepper, and I read one of her books a long time ago (After Long Silence) and really enjoyed it, so I was looking forward to dipping back into one of her books.  However, after a very promising beginning and middle, the book screeches to a halt, falling apart at the seams.<br />Tepper really has a flair for interesting characters.  The story of Disme is almost heart-wrenching at times, as we see her go through despair after despair at the hands of her stepsister, Rashel.  Tepper portrays her vividly, making the reader care deeply about her.  From the very first pages, when she goes out alone at night to get away from her family and to think about things, she is seen as an innocent who seems fated to feel nothing but despair.  It seems that every time she is shown to love or treasure something, Rashel is there to take it away.  As the story progresses and Disme grows into what she will become, you are overjoyed with the way she starts to handle things.  The book follows her from a very rough childhood to when she becomes a woman who can look after herself, and the transformation is remarkable.  She is a wonderful main character.<br />The villains in the novel are also well-portrayed.  Rashel, of course, is thoroughly evil, but Tepper provides enough backstory to show not only why she is, but also makes you almost pity her instead of hating her.  Her mother saved her life once by making a dreadful bargain, a bargain that Rashel must live with for the rest of her life.  It feeds on her natural selfishness, but you still feel a little bit sorry for her even as you're rooting for her to get her comeuppance.  She is a completely three-dimensional character.  I didn't like the fate Tepper gave her, however, as it seemed a bit pointless and unfinished.  I'm sure Tepper was making a point with it, but I couldn't fathom what it is.  It just seemed a bit lazy, and I was beginning to wonder if she was going to finish Rashel's character arc.  She does, but in a perfunctory fashion.<br />I have heard from other readers that Tepper has a tendency to make her male characters evil, following from her feminist tendencies.  I'm glad to say that this time, she generally avoids that.  Of course, there are only a couple of them to worry about, but Doctor Ladislav is a very good man.  He's dedicated to his craft, his patients, and to the eventual downfall of the despotic regime that has a hold of Bastion.  He's very kind, and he becomes very protective of Disme.  He is a great help to her on her quest, and he has a fine mixture of warmth, intelligence, and humour to help things along.<br />What can I say about the plot?  I loved the way Tepper balanced things, telling the story from many different angles before having them all come together in what is almost an explosion of tension.  At first, you have trouble deciphering what all of these disparate plot elements have to do with each other, but Tepper really handles it well.  She uses Nell's Latimer's journal to give a bit of history about this world and what happened to it up until the time the asteroid hit.  She then uses effective exposition to inform about what happened afterward, but avoids the massive infodumps that some authors use to explain this.  Instead, you get snippets that you have to put together.  I found the world Tepper created to be very interesting.<br />Unfortunately, the book has to end.  The Visitor, after chugging along so wonderfully, just completely collapses at the end.  I will avoid giving any spoilers about the ending, but I can tell you that, after the exciting story that has been told so far, and after avoiding all of the political, social, environmental, and feminist dogma that she is supposedly famous for, Tepper all of a sudden spends three whole pages lecturing the reader on almost every one of her petcauses.  The book slams to a halt, losing all sense of momentum that it had reaching this point.  When Tepper explains what the book has been about, when our heroes finally meet their destiny, we find that destiny to be one of fulfilling all of these social dreams that Tepper apparently has for making our current world a better place.  As I was reading this book, I found myself saying \\"It looks like she's avoided everything bad I've heard about her.\\"  And then I get to the end and I almost screamed.  It completely destroys almost everything I liked about the book.  What a complete waste. I felt betrayed.<br />I find I have to give the book a marginal recommendation, because the evocative world that Tepper has created, and the sheer wonderfulness of the storytelling up to that point.  If you like science fiction, you will love everything about this book.  Until the ending.  Of course, if you like being preached to, then you won't mind the ending and you will really love the book.  Keep the ending in mind, be ready for it, and maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did.<br />It's sad, really.causes.

US	50332419	RDSG2RFHYNWHD	0765343274	798059063	The King's Peace (Sulien)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Great political fantasy well-told	The King's Peace, Jo Walton's introductory novel set in a land based on 7th Century England, is a very intriguing tale of politics and loyalty.  It is a loose rendition of the King Arthur tale, with some very big differences.  It is also a well-told tale that unfortunately drags in places.  It sprawls over a period of years, and thus loses a little bit of its momentum.  Even so, it is well worth the price of admission if you like this sort of thing.<br />Sulien ap Gwien, raped and left for dead by Jarnish raiders of her homeland, finds herself on a mission to King Urdo, the newly crowned king of Tir Tanagiri, to beg for help to defeat the raiders.  Urdo is impressed by the young woman and how she fights, and recruits her into his army.<br />Sulien becomes one of Urdo's best soldiers, rapidly rising through the ranks to become his right-hand woman.  Urdo's plan is to unite the land of Tir Tanagiri into one kingdom, instead of a bunch of feuding provinces.  He wants to establish a \\"King's Peace\\" amongst the kings of these provinces.  Friends and enemies both come into the picture, changing allegiances or dying, and years pass rapidly.  Will Urdo's plans come to fruition, or will he ultimately be defeated by the crushing forces that stand against him?<br />The King's Peace is a very plot-driven book, and thus the characters take a back seat to the action.  Sulien herself is a well-developed character, and since the book is told in first person, you get to see a lot of her views on things.  Sulien is a no-nonsense soldier, a woman who is capable of laughing but usually is very serious.  What happened to her will always affect how she feels, and one of those feelings is that she will never marry.  She is capable of being very good friends with a man, but she can't even bear the thought of lying with one.  Urdo is also well-defined, though his characterization is coloured a bit by Sulien's impressions of him.  He's very intense and goal-driven, and he's very good at carrying on through disappointment, such as when a trusted person leaves his service.  He also has a very nice sense of humour, which he is able to share with Sulien.  The rest of the characters are fairly two-dimensional, fulfilling their plot roles well but not really standing out.<br />Thankfully, that's not important because this is a book of nation-building.  That's the fascinating aspect of it.  The similarities to the King Arthur story are very striking, but there are some differences that make it interesting.  Most strikingly, there is complete gender equality I this world.  Women fight at the side of men with no qualms whatsoever.  The fact that Sulien takes the \\"Lancelot\\" role in the tale demonstrates this vividly.  Hopefully she won't share his fate.  Walton tells the tale in a very epic fashion, travelling all over the countryside fighting, policing, and the like.  I have to admire her treatment of religion in this book, with \\"pagan\\" gods as well as the \\"White God\\" being worshipped.  There is great tension between the two sides on this issue, and it's portrayed very well.<br />The only problem with the plot is that sometimes years go by from one chapter to the next, and Sulien is left to summarize what happened.  This makes it a bit imprersonal and threatens to destroy the reader's interest.  Thankfully, the last section of the book doesn't fall into this trap, thus the conclusion is very tense and riveting.  Unfortunately, it ends in a cliffhanger, meaning you have to read &lt;b>The King's Name&lt;/b> to see what happens.<br />For fans of political fantasy, this book is a godsend.

US	50332419	RL86BU321XHZD	0441009646	453469404	Conflict of Honors: A Novel of the Liaden Universe	Books	4	15	18	N	N	Ship of Love	Conflict of Honors, by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, is another space opera novel set in the Liaden universe.  The first book I read, Scout's Progress, was a romance set in a futuristic setting.  This book, on the other hand, is a bit more than that, and that's all for the better.  It has interesting heroes, vile villains, and a bit of action.  I didn't have the same problem getting into it as I did with the first book, but that could be because I was already used to the language used.  Still, there wasn't as much of it, and the storyline is a more straightforward.  Definitely a keeper.<br />Back cover blurbs have been known to be wrong about the contents of a book before, but I rarely see one that's misleading like this one is, while still being essentially accurate.  If you look at the back cover in the bookstore, you get the impression that once Shan and Priscilla meet up, it's a quest for revenge, with nothing standing in their way.  Instead, it's a bit quieter, more subtle.  It's too bad, too, because the book is really good for what it is, and doesn't need a punched up cover blurb to sell it.  In fact, it may detract from it, as readers finds out they're not getting what they thought.<br />That doesn't mean that the plot's not interesting, though.  It is.  The machinations of the bad guys are intriguing, though the First Mate of the Daxflan is a bit too one-dimensionally evil.  Still, the master trader of the ship is very good, walking the fine line between evil and insanity.  Watching them when their plans come to fruition, and seeing how our heroes ultimately resolve the situation is entertaining, and will keep you turning the pages.<br />One problem, though, is that the situations are almost too easy.  I didn't really get the sense of jeopardy from them, and they seemed too easily dealt with.  I enjoyed them because I liked the characters and I wanted to see how they solved the problems, but I didn't get any sense that they were in danger.  Even the short action sequences are rather tame, though they provide the most danger of any of them.  The flaws in the heroes are personal flaws, and in taking care of these situations, they almost seem too perfect.  It brought down the interest level a touch and was ultimately disappointing.  The climax of the book, though, is fitting.  It's understated, a result of negotiation and talking rather than violence.  It's nice that a book like this can end without any real bloodshed, with no shootouts or anything like that.  Instead, it fits in with the rest of the book.<br />The characters in this book (with the exception noted above) are wonderful.  Their emotions are real, raw, and heartfelt.  Priscilla is reserved, hesitating to let her emotions out because she's scared of having them spurned as they have been since she was exiled.  The love she finds on Shan's ship is eye-opening to her, and she learns a great deal about emotional health from the friends she makes.  Lina, her first friend on the ship, is very understanding and patient with her.  The relationship that develops between them is very touching, especially as it grows deeper with time.  Lina is also Shan's lifelong friend, and she feels his pain as he finds himself drawn to Priscilla but can't act on it, due to both how bad it would look as well as the shell that Priscilla is still in.<br />Shan is probably my favourite character, though.  He is so three dimensional, constantly demonstrating different facets to his personality.  He has loyalty to his clan, a burning affection for his friends and a heartfelt duty to his crew.  He's suave, sophisticated, devious and funny.  He's always on the ball and able to think on his feet, which is a good quality as one event after another happens to put Priscilla in jeopardy.  Lee and Miller make the reader care about him, and watching him pine for Priscilla is almost heart-wrenching.<br />Love in Conflict of Honors is very free, and that may put off some readers.  A love triangle ofsorts does form between these three characters, but there is no jealousy, only caring amongst them.  If you have trouble with the idea of same-sex relationships, then steer clear of this book.  There isn't anything graphic about it, so if you don't mind the idea but you don't want to see it in action, then you're safe.  It's worth reading, though, as you come to care about them and want them to succeed.<br />This is a book about relationships, and thus it moves kind of slow.  It's interesting, though, which means that you won't mind spending the time with Shan, Priscilla and Lina.  You get to know them, their deep desires and their outlook on the world.  The loving byplay between them is great.  Don't expect lots of action, like in some space opera books, because Lee and Miller don't write that (at least judging by the two books I've read).  Instead, they write character exploration, what it means to love and what loyalty is.<br />I said earlier that this isn't a romance, but a bit more.  It has some of the trappings of a romance, but the results are much better than that.  If you dislike romances, you shouldn't let that keep you away from this book.  It's definitely worth reading.gle of sorts does form between these three characters, but there is no jealousy, only caring amongst them.

US	50332419	R35SSTFKR8GCD4	0441009271	105212435	Scout's Progress	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Flying into love	Scout's Progress, by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, is a science fiction novel set in the Liaden Universe.  It's space opera combined with Regency romance, and can be a bit hard to get into at first.  It's been awhile since I've read space opera, and that combined with the different kind of language used by the Liadens made me go through a series of starts and stops before finally settling in to a good book.  And it is a good book, if you like that sort of thing.<br />The book is something I'm of two minds about.  As said in the first paragraph, it is a fine example of what it sets out to be, so I'm going to review it as that.  It's not really the type of book that I'm much interested in, and thus I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I may have otherwise.  It is very difficult to get into at first, though I think that may have been a personal thing.  There are two reasons for that.  First, the language is a bit hard to get used to.  It is in English, of course, but it is a very formalized form with some different phrases.  I found it a bit annoying at first, but after about 50 pages or so, I started getting used to it.<br />Secondly, the introduction actually uses the term \\"Regency Romance,\\" which didn't bring good images to my mind.  I'm not a romance reader. Those words put a fear into me that the novel would be overly sappy and trite.  Between that and the language, I almost put the book down 30 pages into it, but I decided to work my way through it and see if I could get something out of it.  Thankfully it worked, and I found myself enjoying the interplay of the characters and the situations, as well as learning about this intriguing world that they lived on, where clan honour is the most important thing, \\"balance\\" for any wrongs against the clan must be achieved, and trade is more important than family.  It is more a science fiction book with romance elements, then a romance book with science fiction elements.  The ending is still a bit too Regency for me and left a small sour taste in my mouth, but the rest of the book is interesting and well worth slogging through the first few pages.  If you don't go in with preconceptions, then it will probably be easier.<br />Aelliana is a divided character, self-confident when it comes to mathematics, but when it comes to interpersonal relationships, she is cowed and very subservient.  She finds her true calling when she goes into the Binjali Repair Shop to see her new ship, and meets the proprietor, Jon dea'Cort.  She finds herself at home with him and the other workers and pilots there, and she finds a companionship that she desperately needs.  On meeting Daav, there isn't the spark of romance that one would expect.  It was nice to see a relationship build naturally, with none of this \\"I saw her and I had to have her!\\" nonsense that romance novels are known for.  It builds slowly as Daav instructs her in piloting, first to a mutal respect, and then to a growing attraction that finally ignites.<br />Daav is also an intriguing character.  He works at Binjali for his own interest, not making his status as Delm of Clan Korval known to the general population.  Jon knows, as well as his fellow pilots, but he never tells Aelliana, and he very carefully never uses his last name around her.  He even has Jon sign one of her pilot's certificates so that he can avoid using it.  I'm not completely sure if this is something he does generally, or if it's something to do with Aelliana.  That bit was unclear to me.  He is still interesting, though.  He has a sense of compassion that is not common for people of his status (though Clan Korval already has a reputation for eccentricity).  He is torn between his obligations to his clan and to his desire to be a free spirit.  His growing love for Aelliana only complicates things as well, demonstrating even more that the woman he is supposed to marry is not somebody he wants to spend much time with.  When a decision is finally forced on him by circumstances,it makes for an explosive situation.<br />The only character who I found lacking was Ran Eld.

US	50332419	R2HQEWOBPOC17L	0743400518	452222728	2: Avatar Book Two (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	The Deep Space 9 saga continues	This is a review of the two part Star Trek: Deep Space Nine story called Avatar.<br />The only disappointment I with the Deep Space Nine TV series  was with the way they ended it.  It was a bit anti-climactic, the final episode wasn't well-written, but it also left me really wishing that we could see where the characters would go from there.  Thus, I was overjoyed when I saw that Pocket Books was going to continue the Deep Space Nine story, starting with the two book series called Avatar, by S.D. Perry.  Was it worth the wait?  Was it worthy of the Deep Space Nine name?<br />To quote a famous 60s persona stuck in the 90s, \\"YEAH, BABY!\\"<br />Avatar contains a wonderful mix of the characters fans love along with a selection of new characters that have a lot of potential.  Perry has come up with a very plausible way for the story to continue, that contains action, intrigue, romance, and personal strife.  Probably the best portrayed, though, is Colonel Kira.  Kira was one of my favourites on the TV show, and it's a testament to Perry's writing that I could hear Nana Visitor speaking the lines and going through the conflicts that the story puts her through.  Kira is so well-rounded (though it does help that the TV show provided a wonderful springboard for this), and Perry paints the angles and the gray areas of the character marvelously.  When Kira has to go through a crisis of faith, with the prophecy making her choose between her religious beliefs and what's best for the people of Bajor, I could feel the tension radiating off of the page.<br />The rest of the returning characters succeed admirably as well.  Dr. Julian Bashir and Ezri Dax continue the relationship that they formed during the last season of the TV, but they find that interspecies romance isn't always what it's cracked up to be.  Nog, the young Ferengi ensign who matured greatly during his fighting in the war, especially when he lost his leg in battle, has become the new Chief of Operations on the station.  He's still dealing with the emotional trauma of the war, and it doesn't help when a Jem'Hadar warrior from the Dominion beams on board and claims to be there on a peace mission.  All of the characters are very true to their characterization from the series, but Perry expands on that as well.  All of them seem real, but they show the ability to grow in interesting ways.  I look forward to more character growth in the rest of the series.<br />The new characters are just as good.  I found Ro Laren the most intriguing.  She's a character from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series, a Bajoran who joined a rebel group against the Federation, but is now the new security chief on the station.  She brings a real emotional conflict with her, trying to decide where she belongs, and whether or not she belongs among her fellow Bajorans.  She doesn't have the same faith in the Prophets that her people do, and this often puts her into conflict with Kira.  I found that Ro's character really stood out in this one, and I think she'll quickly become my favourite of the new bunch.  She'll always have a slight chip on her shoulder, which will bring her into some conflict with the rest of her compatriots.  It should be interesting to see how her relationship with Kira  develops, especially after what happens at the end of the book.<br />I found the Vaughn character slightly annoying, just because he seemed almost too perfect.  He's 101 years old, only a Commander but yet seeming to have the ear of all the higher-ups in Starfleet.  He doesn't really come across as haughty; he's actually more philosophical than anything else.  However, he just seems to know everything.  Hopefully his character will be a little subtler in subsequent books.  Ensign Shar, the Andorian technical officer, is also given a nice character hook, but not much is done with it.  I think that will be done more in future books as well.  What we are given, though, is very nice.<br />I've said a lot about the characters, mainly because I think they are very important to any Star Trek series, whether it's a book series or TV series.  But how is the plot?  I'm pleased to say that Perry hits a home run with that as well.  It's the perfect continuation from the TV series, yet completely understandable to anybody picking this up with no knowledge of the series.  It even has a complete timeline of the TV series at the beginning of Book 1, which is a tremendous help to new readers as well as forgetful older readers as well.  Perry blends the plots very well, all of them interacting at points, but having their own resolution.  There's no contrived \\"one size fits all\\" solution to everything.<br />In fact, not everything is completely resolved, and the book actually ends on an emotional cliffhanger, which I found pleasing.  It really brought the feel of the TV series back to the books, as if this is a true continuation, Season 8 if you will.  Character arcs don't end in the same book where they begin.  The book is self-contained plot-wise, but things aren't necessarily rosy when the book ends.  I found this a really nice touch.<br />There are no gaping plot holes, and everything leads naturally into each other.  There are no contrived situations either.  Perry writes with ease, and her prose is very good for this kind of book.  It's not literature, but it doesn't aspire to be.  Instead, it aspires to be a great Star Trek novel, and in that it succeeds admirably.  Between the two books, you get over 500 pages of action-adventure, interesting characters and lots of drama.

Hogfather, the twentieth Discworld adventure written by Terry Pratchett, is a wonderful tale about the power of belief and what it can bring to humanity.  I found myself laughing out loud constantly while reading this book, which is always a good sign, and definitely a step up from Sourcery.  It was very pleasurable to be enjoying Pratchett again.  It was also very nice to have a good Death book again, after the small bump that was Soul Music<br />Can anybody not like the idea of a skeletal Death, all decked out in a red and white costume with false beard and false belly, trying to go down chimneys and bring presents to all the good little boys and girls of the world?  The idea itself is enough to get me laughing, but Pratchett's implementation of it has to be seen to be believed.  Pratchett pulls out all the stops in this one, with laughs as simple as Death trying to figure out how to open a door to let Albert into the house, and as complicated as philosophical discussions about human belief and how it orders the universe (in a way that the Auditors don't like, of course).  Death continues to marvel at the ability of humanity to \\"be untruthful\\" by \\"telling the universe it is other than it is.\\"  This powerful belief creates beings like the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy, the Boogeyman (the original!), that sort of thing.  That's what makes Death such a wonderful character: his ability to learn, to adapt, and to see both the strengths and weaknesses of humanity, as well as his fascination with how humans do things.<br />Susan, his granddaughter, just wants to be normal again.  It's been two years since Soul Music, and she doesn't want to go back to that life.  But while Death can take the Hogfather's place, he can't physically intervene in the events that are occuring, so Susan must.  She goes on a journey that takes her to where the Hogfather usually lives, and to the realm of the Tooth Fairy, where Teatime is using the magic of the teeth to erase the belief in the Hogfather.  Susan is much more interesting in this book then in Soul Music, mainly because it doesn't take her as long to start getting in on the action.  Previously, the entire first part of the book was spent with \\"recruiting\\" her to what needed to be done.  In Hogfather, it happens much more quickly, which makes the beginning of the book a lot more interesting.  The beginning also contains a little bit of foreshadowing.  She is governess of two children, whose previous governess constantly reminded them that certain monsters would get them if they did something, and now Susan has to fight them off they are created by the children's belief.  I found this very effective, and a good prelude to the philosophical aspect of the story.<br />The wizards are their usual selves, bumbling along making you wonder how they ever get through life, as well as wondering how they'd ever survive if they weren't in the insular confines of the University.  Pratchett does flesh them out a bit, giving them even more personality then they had before.  The Archchancellor is remarkably on top of things at times, while at other times he's as dense as a brick.  He has the ability to pick up what is happening a lot quicker than you would think.  The Bursar is his usual excitable self, downing Dried Frog Pills to make life bearable.  I found it hilarious when they would make monsters and fairies appear by speaking aloud their wonderment at various aspects of life.  \\"Supposing some idiot says there must be a god of indigestion, eh?\\"  As usual, Pratchett uses the wizards for two things: to illustrate the effect of what is going on in the story, and as yet another source of comedy. That's why I find the wizards fascinating and very useful to the plot.  While on first view their story is completely separate (though they do interact with both Susan and Death), it actually has a lot to do with the what's going on.<br />Pratchett's talent for wonderful characters continues with everybody else in the book.  Teatime's a very creepy person.  He's one of the few people who could figure out how to kill somebody like the Hogfather.  He's ruthless, willing to kill on a whim, and very determined to get the job done.  Then there's the oh god, the God of Hangovers, who is constantly sick and feeling horrible because he take personifies all the effects of drinking.  He's miserable, but he plays the faithful companion to Susan on her mission.  He's new to the world, but he's willing to learn.<br />Those are just a few of the great characters, but there are many more.  Pratchett's writing is at the top of his form, with hardly a misstep.  Susan is still slightly dull, but other than that, everything's a winner.  He moves effortlessly from slapstick comedy to serious discussions of the nature of the universe and then back again.  His descriptions are both humorous and yet true to life.  While you can read the book just for the humour value, it's Pratchett's comments on the nature of belief and how we humans make the world up as we go along that really makes this book a standout.  Whether or not you agree with him, the points are interestingly made, but they don't detract from the fun of the book at all.  The book is a must read for any Pratchett fan, and it would make a wonderful introduction to the series to a newcomer, as none of the previous Death books are needed to understand this one.<br />Death is back.

Royal Blood, by Bertram Fields (a lawyer), is another book on the Richard III controversy.  The kicker in this case is, though, that he appears to be writing this more to answer other books and theories then he is to put forward his own theory.  I found that aspect very enjoyable.  It's very interesting, well-written, and I believe it does its job in restoring some of the ambiguity to the case.  It's not without its flaws, but it is a very good book nonetheless.<br />I was fascinated by this book. This appears to be an attack on the writers who have claimed that Richard definitely killed the princes.  He adds some much needed ambiguity to the whole issue, and I found his opinions to be very interesting and logical.  He questions everything, from why Richard wanted to extend his Protectorship until the princes were of age (rather then just until Edward V was crowned, like the Queen's family wanted) to the confessions of Tyrell and Dighton.  One of his theories on these confessions is especially intriguing: the princes were said to have been moved after they were murdered and placed under the stairs.  Sir Thomas More, one of the more recognized chroniclers of the period, says this and crows about the confessions, and how they did not know where the bodies had been reburied.  However, if the bodies were moved, how can the bones that were found exactly where More said they were originally interred actually be the princes?  And if they are the princes, why did Tyrell and Dighton claim not to know where they were buried?  Is it because these confessions (written records of which have never been found) never truly existed?<br />Fields applies this logic to other theories about the princes, too.  He questions Thomas More's history, having been written many years after the fact.  More's history is unfinished, and Fields puts forth the theory that perhaps More stopped because he was finding evidence that the real story of the princes was much different then Henry VI would have liked.  It's just a theory, and Fields certainly doesn't present it as fact, but it is intriguing nonetheless. In fact, Fields does a good job of avoiding treating his theories as the truth.  He occasionally slips, but not often.  For the most part, he takes a look at the common theories and presents logical arguments for why those theories aren't necessarily true, presenting some very intriguing possibilities to explain them.<br />His main target seems to be Weir and her book The Princes in the Tower, and this is one of the few failings of the book.  It almost seems like a vendetta against her book.  This book was obviously inspired by his unhappiness with her theories and the way she presents them.  While I can certainly sympathize with him there, sometimes it almost appears too personal.  He seems to take great pleasure in ripping Weir's ideas to shreds, and this is a bit unbecoming of him.  Because of this, it doesn't read like the academic text that it perhaps should be.<br />The second problem with the book is the occasional forays into lawyer-speak.  These chapters, while thankfully short, can get dreadfully dull at times.  He goes on and on about what a court of law today would require to convict Richard, and then says that, since this is history, such standards don't apply.  I think anybody who has any interest in this subject already has at least some idea of how hard it can be to decide the truth of a historical event.  We don't really need it spelled out for us, at least not so often.<br />Finally, the final chapter, \\"What If,\\" gives a \\"history\\" lesson of what might have happened if Richard had allowed Edward V to rule instead of taking over for him?  What follows is a very unlikely set of circumstances that get more and more strange as Fields gets closer to modern times.  It's not logical at all, which is surprising given the logic Fields effectively applies to the rest of the book.  He talks about how the American colonies are set up as a refuge forProtestant dissenters, but the attempt to rebel against England is crushed by the combined might of England, France, and Spain.  Later on, however, he talks about how America and Germany have joined England and France as \\"the most powerful dominions of the Euro empire.\\"  Huh?  It seems like a waste of four pages, and thankfully Fields doesn't go into too much detail on this one.<br />Ultimately, I think Royal Blood succeeds in what it is trying to do:  bring some ambiguity back into this controversy.  It is certainly not Pro-Richard, except in the sense that it doesn't automatically assume that Richard is guilty.  He even goes as far as to say that if the princes were murdered, Richard must be considered the prime suspect.  Because of that, it is easier to take some of his suppositions and discard the rest.  The entire book does not rest on these theories, and thus it is not in danger of collapsing when something is disproved.  Fields is also a very capable writer, making his case and making it in an interesting fashion so you don't find yourself dozing off.  If he could have avoided speaking as a lawyer so often, this would probably be a 5-star book.  As it is, though, it is still well worth reading if you have any interest in the subject.r Protestant dissenters, but the attempt to rebel against England is crushed by the combined might of England, France, and Spain.

US	50332419	R183EJFRMJ4492	0446609536	357154284	The Thirteenth Scroll	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Romping through merry  faux-England	I picked up The Thirteenth Scroll, by Rebecca Neason, at the library when I was browsing for something interesting to read.  I was in a hurry, so I didn't have time to do my customary glance-through before choosing it.  I'm kind of sorry that I didn't.  Not that it's a bad book, necessarily, but it's just not very interesting.<br />The book reads almost like a Christian feminist fantasy novel.  It's very strange in that way.  When Neason starts talking about the Church, I thought that it would be very interesting to see a fantasy novel where religion played such a strong part.  When she referred to the Virgin and the cross, I started to wonder \\"why did she have to base so much of this on Christianity rather than coming up with everything herself?\\"  Then, finally, when she referred to real historical figures, I had to stop for a moment.  It completely threw me out of the book.  This is just a thinly disguised Britain!  All the names have been changed, all of the recent (as far as the book is concerned) history is gone, but the history of the Church remains the same.<br />After realizing this, I started to notice geographical details mentioned in the text that implied that the land is Britain.  The book mentions the tip at the extreme north of the land, which does remind me of the northern tip of Scotland.  Now I see why there was no map in the book.  Even so, there should be a map, because all of the names of the various provinces, as well as the cities and towns referred to, have no relation to each other or to reality.  It's incredibly hard to follow when you don't have a map to guide you.  It was extremely irritating.  If you're going to change all the names, then you need a map!<br />So why did I call it a Christian *feminist* fantasy novel?  The two main characters are Lysandra and Aurya.  While you do get some viewpoints from Renan, they don't read very differently from Lysandra's.  Not to mention the fact that Renan's point of view sections are usually ways of showing how heroic and stoic Lysandra is, and how Renan is starting to feel more for her then a priest should.  He doesn't really serve much more of a purpose in the book other than that.  The other male characters aren't really developed at all.  They are just people who our heroes (or villains) interact with<br />This by itself doesn't make it a feminist novel.  However, many of Aurya's passages talk about how easy men are to control with feminine wiles.  She talks about how weak Giraldus and, by extension, other men are because they are susceptible to manipulation like this.  She has Giraldus wrapped around her finger and she seems convinced that she can rule the kingdom the same way.  My head started to hurt with how often \\"women good, men bad\\" was drummed into it.  Personally, I don't think the fact that Aurya's an evil witch takes away from that description of the book, either.  Ultimately, Lysandra and Aurya are two sides of the same coin:  a light and a dark side.  The men in the book, however, are just a gray area (except, of course, the men who raped and blinded Lysandra when she was 17 and killed her family, who are definitely evil).<br />The book doesn't have too many characters in it, and none of them are particularly interesting.  None of them are badly done, necessarily, but they don't draw you in and force you to care about them.  Lysandra and Renan are very good people and Aurya and Giraldus are very bad people.  There are two innocents involved:  an underworld dweller named Talog and the Font of Wisdom.  Neither character gets much development and both are basically there to fulfill their plot functions.  As mentioned earlier, Lysandra and Aurya get most of the character development, some of which will probably be explored in subsequent books.<br />There is one other character that I haven't mentioned, mainly because his subplot doesn't end up having much to do with the book itself.  It's clearly there for ongoing series reasons.  His name is Elon, and he's a bishop who has designs on becoming Archbishop when the current one retires.  Ostensibly, this subplot is in the book because Elon has to set the stage for Giraldus and Aurya's triumphant return from their mission.  He's a greedy one, more interested in power (political and religious as well as arcane) then piety.  He's stereotypically evil, though, with not much characterization beyond that.  The way the book ends makes his plotline superfluous, at least for this book alone.  The book, for the most part, is self-contained, with just these few plot and character items that will probably carry over to the next book.<br />Finally, I found the prose a bit annoying.  This was mostly when the bad guys were on the scene, namely Elon and Aurya.  The narration kept emphasizing how evil and power hungry they both are, so much so that the repetition became very dull.  Yes, we get the fact that they won't let anybody stand in their way.  We get the fact that, if they succeed, they will rule everything.  We get the fact that Aurya will control the Church.  We get the fact that Elon will control Aurya.  Could we please move on?  Other than that, the prose is pretty lifeless, almost light and airy in a way.<br />Ultimately, I was unimpressed by The Thirteenth Scroll. It's a quick read, I'll give it that.  However, that's about it.  I've heard that it's the start of a five or six book series.  I know I won't be coming back for book two.Elon, and he's a bishop who has designs on becoming Archbishop when the current one retires.

US	50332419	R16JTOMS4HITIM	0345383729	608322438	The Princes in the Tower	Books	2	308	343	N	N	Good story, brutal history	I'm of two minds on Alison Weir's The Princes in the Tower.  On the one hand, it is an immensely readable history of Richard III, king of England, and the mystery of what happened to his nephews who he had confined to the Tower of London.  Weir comes down strongly on the side that Richard had his nephews killed.  Weir writes well, and the reader is sucked in to the story.  On the other hand, though, Weir's research and conclusions are atrocious and beneath what a proper historian should be.  She makes many suppositions and then treats them as fact.  Some of her timelines are wildly inaccurate, and since she uses these to support her theory, that puts the entire theory in doubt.  Thus, while it's an enjoyable read, I can't really recommend the book unless the reader is aware of this and willing to read further on the subject without taking Weir's view as indisputable fact.<br /><br />Where to begin?  Weir starts out by discussing the various sources of information on the controversy.  Many of these sources weren't contemporary at all, being written after Henry VII had taken the throne.  The one she bases most of her theories on, an unfinished history by Sir Thomas More, she claims is contemporary.  However, Thomas was eight years old at the time these events occurred and didn't start his book until much later.  He supposedly had access to many people \\"in the know,\\" and Weir takes this as proof that what he says is, for the most part, accurate.  What she fails to take into account, however, is More's history was written during the Tudor reign, when it wasn't exactly safe to be extolling Richard's virtues.  Sure, More's sources may have been there, but do you really think they're going to risk their head by telling the truth?  In fact, Weir states many times that many people who were involved in the events were still alive at this time, and surely would have been in a position to know if More wasn't accurate.  This is complete hogwash, since it would have meant dire consequences to dispute these \\"facts.\\" The other sources written during the Tudor reign suffer from this problem as well.<br /><br />Weir states at the beginning of the book that she wrote this book \\"...because there is a need for the subject to be dealt with from an objective viewpoint based on common sense and sound research.\\"  After saying this, however, Weir proceeds to write a hatchet job on Richard that shows no real signs of objectivity at all.  She mentions the Tudor historians and the problems inherent in taking them at face value, but then proceeds to do just that when they support her theory.  When they don't, of course, they may have gotten it wrong.  She casually presents and discards some of the pro-Richard historical work that is around, dismissing them as impossible.<br /><br />Elsewhere in the book, she gets timelines wrong in ways that make what she says impossible.  One of the most blatant is when she's discussing the timing of the murders.  She says that the murders had to have happened on the night of September 3.  However, later when she's discussing how other monarchs around Europe felt about Richard and the Princes, she states that Louis XI of France clearly believed that Richard had committed the murders.  She goes on to say, though, that Louis died on August 30, 1483, 4 days before the murders supposedly happened!  How can this be?  There are other problems in Weir's logic that similarly cast her theories into doubt.<br /><br />Finally, many times in the book she says that something \\"could have\\" happened, or she claims that it's logical to assume something.  She then goes on to base many more \\"facts\\" on these suppositions, making her conclusions balanced on a tissue-thin platform just waiting to collapse.  One of the most outrageous is her assumption that More has credibility because he talked to some nuns.  Thomas More used to go visit a convent in which Brackenbury's widow and some other Yorkist (a noble family at this time) ladies were inretirement. He could have talked with them, says Weir, and they could have known the real truth about the princes, and they could have told him.  She then goes on to say that thus, More's tale has to be accurate, because these nuns would know.  Huh?  Weir has no idea if More actually did this, but she goes on to base her assumption on this.  The book is filled with these \\"might have been\\" statements.<br /><br />It's a shame that such a well-written book has to be so poorly presented as history.  I really like Alison Weir's books (though I am aware that many historians find her work shoddy), but this one is just too much.  Even I, a historical novice, can see how badly done this book is.  She did a lot of research, but the conclusions she has taken from that research are flimsy and not well-supported at all (though she attempts to show that they are).  If you find yourself reading this book, please keep that in mind and read something else on the subject as well.  As long as the beginning reader is aware of this, then it's not so bad and this book can be a good start on getting interested in the subject.

US	50332419	R2LM2NJSOAA9OJ	0756400627	782453290	The Better Part of Valor (Valor Novel)	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Where'd that ship come from?	Better Part of Valor, by Tanya Huff, is the second in what appears to be an ongoing series of books about Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr, and her adventures in the Marines.  It's just as enjoyable as the first book, Valor's Choice, but it unfortunately has the same problems as the first one did (with one exception).  Torin is just as fascinating, but the characterization of the other Marines is just as thin.  Still, if you like military sci-fi, then you should enjoy this one as well.<br />After their mission to Silviss (as detailed in Valor's Choice), Kerr told General Morris exactly what she thought of him and the \\"mission\\" he had sent her platoon on.  This, of course, is a mistake, and he doesn't take too kindly to it.  In response, she's separated from her platoon and put in charge of a makeshift squad of Marines who have been charged with safeguarding a scientific expedition.  It seems that a mysterious craft has appeared.  It's seemingly a derelict and it is huge.  The expedition is sent to get inside the ship and see what is in there.  Kerr is in charge of the escort.  To make matters worse, Confederation politics has saddled her with a commander who is there to look good rather then because he is competent.<br />What is the secret of this ship?  Was it created by the Others, the enemy of the Confederation?  Is it something completely different?  If not the Others, then what alien race could have produced something so massive and unintelligible?  What's its agenda?  And whose side is it on?  Kerr must not only figure this out, but she also must figure out how to keep her troops alive, and how to keep her commander alive when he seems determined to get them all killed.<br />There is one confusing thing about this book if you've read the first one.  That book ends with Kerr on decent (though definitely not good) terms with General Morris.  All of sudden, though, at the beginning of this book, this has changed.  It's made clear in Better Part of Valor that this attitude is because of Kerr's actions at the end of the mission in the first book, but there's no indication in the first book that there is any problem.  It's a trifle jarring, but nothing really to worry about.  I just thought I would mention it because it affects how the series holds together.  Too many of these little continuity errors cropping up has destroyed many a series.<br />All in all, this book is just as good as the first one.  Kerr is still a fantastic character, though this book gives her a bit more depth as she has to handle an attraction to one of the civilians brought into the group, Ryder.  She doesn't like him and his attitude, but she's still very drawn to him, and the constant interplay between the two characters is very neat.  Unlike the first book, where the only thoughts you saw were Kerr's, you get to see other characters' thoughts as well.  Thus, you get to see how Ryder reacts to Kerr's no-nonsense approach to things, and how he tries to play upon her attraction to him.  It really is interesting to see the verbal dance between the two of them.<br />The other standout aspect to this book is the suspense.  The puzzle of the alien ship is very intriguing, and surprise builds on surprise once they are inside it.  Kerr must constantly deal with changing circumstances, especially once they are cut off from their support ships.  You are constantly wondering what's going to happen next, and what secrets the ship holds.  You seriously wonder which characters (other than the obvious, of course) are going to survive, which really adds to the tension level.<br />The characters on the outside of the ship (Captain Carveg, General Morris, Lt. Commander Sibley, and most of the others) are very interesting as well.  They're not very three-dimensional, but they fulfill their purposes admirably, with great dialogue and appropriate action.  Much of the action takes place outside of Kerr's view, and it's a credit to Huff that she makes it just as interesting without making you wish to get back to Kerr's story.  You can feel the frustration as every rescue attempt they make is countered by the alien ship.<br />While this book avoids the predictability problem of the first book (which was too closely based on an actual historical event and the movie made from it), it suffers again from the thin characterization of the Marines.  It's offset a little by the fact that there are only twelve of them, but it still makes it hard to tell them apart.  Add to that the scientific team and others, and the problem still adds up.  It takes a while to get the various characters and their respective species straight, which can make for a confusing read.<br />The other problem is the ambiguous ending.  While I'm a fan of the occasional ambiguity, in this book it made the book seem like almost a waste.  There really wasn't much of a payoff, which is a shame.  It's still not bad, and you will enjoy reading it, but it's a bit of a let-down.  The characterization of Kerr and Ryder make it worth the trip, but I wish Huff had ended it a little better.<br />My recommendation for this book is very similar to my recommendation for the first.  If you like military SF, then you will like this book.  It really brings home the \\"Marine\\" feeling.  However, if you don't like the genre, there's nothing here that will make you want to start.out making you wish to get back to Kerr's story.

US	50332419	R8FX7ABICI76Y	0886778964	579829556	Valor's Choice (Valor Novel)	Books	4	19	21	N	N	A good start to a military sci-fi series	Valor's Choice, by Tanya Huff, is an enjoyable military science fiction book with a very strong heroine.  Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr has to be one of the more interesting characters I've seen in awhile, at least in a science fiction setting.  It's a fun book to read, with some poignant moments as well.  Unfortunately, thin characterization of the rest of the marines, as well as a plot that's very tightly based on a real historical occurrence and the movie that was made from it, mar what is otherwise a great book.  Make sure you do not read the author's note before reading this book, or the last half of the book will be way too predictable.<br />It starts out with a prologue that explains the \\"history\\" of the universe Huff has created.  This is a very good thing, because none of that history could conceivably be told within the narrative of this book without massive info-dumps that would break the fluidity of the story.  None of the back story is actually used in the book, but it flavours the feelings and actions of the Marines, and thus is very important to the feel of the book.<br />That being said, the different aliens and their characteristics can be very confusing sometimes, because of the off-hand manner in which Huff treats them.  She's created some interesting ones (like the di'Taykan, who look almost like elves out of human mythology, and are hyper-sexual).  The problem is that it's hard to keep track of which species does what.  Then, you have numerous characters spread throughout these different species, and you have to try and keep track of who is what (oh, he's a Krai!  That's why he's talking about eating anything and everything).  Seriously, it can be confusing without a scorecard sometimes.  The fact that these Marines are basically reduced to making wisecracks and participating in the action doesn't help, either.  Nothing really distinguishes them *except* their species' characteristics.<br />While this does detract from the enjoyment of the book a little, Valor's Choice is still a wonderful, action-filled romp that is greatly enjoyable.  Kerr is a wonderful character and Huff provides lots of detail about her.  While the perspective of the story changes at times, the only thoughts you read are Kerr's.  She's the perfect NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer, for you non-military types):  she keeps her opinion to herself unless it's her duty to give it, she's able to give inflection to the word \\"Sir\\" to tell you what she thinks of the person she's talking to, she gives her troops all of the necessary latitude but is willing to reign them in if they go too far, and she has earned the respect of the people under her.  She's funny at times, no nonsense at others.  You really find yourself caring about what happens to her, and if she makes a mistake, you feel for her when it costs her one of her Marines.<br />The plot of the book does take a while to get going, but it never really drags because of the byplay between Kerr and the rest of the Marines.  Sections within the chapters are relatively short, which gives the book an action-movie feel, almost like quick-cutting does in a film.  Once the action really starts, it comes fast and furious, and you find yourself being carried along for the ride.  If explosions and military hardware are your thing, then you will love this book.  The good thing, though, is that Huff never goes into dry technobabble about this hardware.  She tells you what the weapon or ship does and then she moves on with the story.  This is much better than David Weber (who I really like, but that's one of his main failings)<br />I cannot reiterate enough, however, that you must avoid the author's note at the end of the book until you have finished it.  If you don't, then not only will the ending be spoiled, but the mystery of why things are happening will also be spoiled.  It's too bad that other reviews have already given it away, because I think it seriously detracts from the first reading of the book.<br />All in all, if you're a fan of military science fiction, you will like this book.  It's well-written, has wonderful dialogue and a lot of action.  It's not literature, but it doesn't aspire to be.  It aspires to be fun, and that's what it is.  If you don't like the genre, this book won't give you any reason to start liking it.r />All in all, if you're a fan of military science fiction, you will like this book.

US	50332419	R3E28IST0SAR93	0345435729	798168467	Morgawr (The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, Book 3)	Books	3	22	26	N	N	A travelogue disguised as the ending of a fantasy series	I've been a fan of Terry Brooks' Shannara series ever since the first book.  The series is both interesting in its own right, yet wrapped in a familiarity that's very pleasant to the fantasy reader.  The main knock against the later books in the series is that Brooks' characters tend to be very similar to previous versions.  The entire Voyage of the Jerle Shannara series has suffered from this affliction.  Not only that, but Brooks seems like he has been treading water with this series.  The third and final book, Morgawr, is more of the same: comfortable, yet just a little too familiar.  Rabid Brooks fans will definitely love it.  Other Brooks fans will find that they enjoyed it, but it left them feeling a little bit empty, like having eaten some Chinese food and feeling hungry a couple of hours later.<br />The main problem with Morgawr is that it is basically a runaround.  The main characters run, the Morgawr and his mwellrats pursue them.  Some of the party runs into a monster, some action happens, and it's over.  It all builds to a final confrontation that's obvious from the beginning, and it can take forever to get there.  Doctor Who fans may be familiar with the \\"endless corridor\\" aspect of that show, where it seems like most of the story consists of the characters running back and forth down corridors.  This book had much the same feeling, only on a larger scale.<br />There are also a series of coincidences and other illogical happenings that make the eyes roll.  The party regroups in a much too easy way after being separated for so long.  They basically run into each other.  A few of them are better explained, having been found by Hunter Predd and his roc, a huge bird with very keen eyesight who has been patrolling the area in the air.  However, the others are just a chance meeting that strains credulity to the limit.  Not only that, but the Ilse Witch wakes from her catatonia in order to heal somebody, and gives Bek a vital clue that he needs, before returning to her catatonic state.  The clue makes this happening very important, but I don't really buy the ultimate reasoning for why it happened.<br />The characters in Morgawr aren't bad, and Brooks has no qualms about killing some of them.  This is a very bloody book (series, actually, since it started in the first book).  Again, though, the characters are very similar to characters in past Shannara series, and the recognition factor jars.  Bek is pretty much the same as previous Ohmsfords, Quenten Leah is like the Leahs of old, with his magic Sword of Leah.  The Rovers are, as a group, similar to characters in the previous two series.  At least the two main Rovers, Redden Alt Mer and Rue Meridian, are fairly distinctive, and interesting in their own right.  This is not to say that the characters aren't interesting, because for the most part they are.  I just wish they were different.  They're comfortable characters, however, and fans of the series will like them.  If this is the first Shannara series you've read, you won't notice this and will probably enjoy them in their own right.<br />The final problem to mention is Brooks' tendency to have is characters brood.  They do this a lot, and the most annoying times are when the characters are in danger, or waiting for danger to come to them.  It's not unusual for a character to be on guard, or watching for something to come at them, and spend one or two pages brooding about his or her circumstances, what's happened on this mission, friends who have died, or whatever.  For me, it breaks the tension rather than adding to it.  I kept saying to myself \\"would you please stop thinking and just get on with it?\\"  And since the characters are usually brooding about similar things (the events since they arrived here), it also gets a bit repetitious as well.<br />Still, it is an enjoyable series to read, even more so if you've never read a Shannara book before.  Brooks really has a talent for action scenes, and when they happen they are usually exciting.  You do care for the characters and they are three-dimensional for the most part.  You never know whether a character is safe or not, which also adds to the tension.  Brooks kills off quite a number of them.  I really enjoyed the finale, as the Morgawr, who has been shown to be much more powerful than any magic Bek or the Ilse Witch have, is defeated by brains rather than \\"a lucky shot\\" or something like that.<br />While I enjoy the Shannara books, and give this one just over 3 stars, part of me wishes Brooks would leave Shannara for awhile, or at least try to do something new with it.  The concept of the Jerle Shannara series *is* new, with a voyage across the sea, but he wraps it in too many familiarities for this reader.  If this is your first exposure to Brooks, then it's not so bad, and you will be entertained.  I guess that's not a bad thing.y are usually exciting.

US	50332419	R14ZL5PDPQGM4S	0380818418	531917670	Year's Best Fantasy 2	Books	5	27	29	N	N	Short and sweet fantasy	I don't read too many short story collections.  I'm usually too immersed in novels to take the time to read them.  However, last year, I was browsing through the bookstore and saw an intriguing cover for Year's Best Fantasy, edited by David G. Hartwell.  I picked it up on a whim, and loved it to pieces.  I made a point to keep an eye out for this year's volume, and scooped it up as soon as I got a chance.  This collection is just as good as last year's, and well worth a look-see from the choosy fantasy reader.<br />This book contains all sorts of fantasy types.  There are urban fantasies that take place in the modern day with fantastical elements, fantasies that have traditional wizard type characters, religious fantasy, and many more.  It's all here in this one volume. All of the stories (bar two) are at the very least interesting.  The overall quality of this book is excellent, however, with most of the stories (with the exception of the Ursula Le Guin story at the beginning) being short enough for you to read right before bed.<br />The best story in this book is the first one, \\"The Finder\\" by Ursula Le Guin.  It's reprinted from her Tales From Earthsea collection of stories.  After reading it, I had the urge to go out and read the rest of the Earthsea books, as it was that good.  It's the story of Otter, a young son of a shipbuilder.  The story takes place in the distant past in relation to the other Earthsea books, in a time when magic was looked down upon and feared.  Otter has some magic power, especially the ability to \\"find\\" things by thinking about them.  He is captured by the \\"king\\" of the area and given to the king's wizard in order to be made useful.  The story becomes one of Otter's attempts to escape, how Otter learns to use his powers, and how he becomes a part of Earthsea history as well.  The story is at times poignant, and at other times just plain fascinating.  Le Guin has such a wonderful sense of character and setting that she literally draws you a picture.  Otter is well-portrayed, going from young innocent boy to a responsible young man and teacher in the space of the story.  The other characters are also interesting, including a truly evil antagonist who is still well-rounded, even though the reader hates him.  He's not a cartoon character, which is very nice.  This is the longest story in the book, at 95 pages, and it's worth every one of them.<br />Then there is \\"Apologue,\\" a 2-page story by James Morrow, where three former big-city nemeses (a giant ape, a giant lizard, and a giant rhedosaur) return to New York to help out in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks.  I couldn't believe that this much feeling could be contained in a 2-page story, but Morrow does it.  It is a truly touching tale of formerly destructive beings doing what they can to help.  It really is a moving experience to read this one.  If you simply do not want to buy this book, then you should quickly read this story in the bookstore.  It almost brought a tear to my eye.<br /><br />Other particularly strong stories are \\"In the Shadow of Her Wings\\" by Ashok Banker (a story of political assassination and reincarnation in near-future India), \\"The Black Heart\\" by Patrick O'Leary (a story of good and evil at an airport, which takes a surprising turn at the end), and \\"To Others We Know Not Of,\\" by Kate Riedel (a story of a married woman and a man from her past, returned to seek her help and explain why he left so long ago).  These are the particularly noteworthy ones, though the rest of the stories are good as well (with the two exceptions below).<br />The two exceptions, for me anyway, were \\"Hell is the Absence of God,\\" by Ted Chiang, and \\"Stitchery,\\" by Devon Monk.  Chiang's story takes place in a world where Heaven and Hell are real places, God is a real being with an intrusive agenda that has nothing to do with love, and angelic visitations are relatively common occurrences.  These visitations don't always have good results, as sometimes they happen with so much force as to cause wholesale destruction, injuring and even killing people.  Neil Fisk's wife is one of these casualties, and thus Neil completely loses his faith in God.  This is the story of his attempt to be with her in the afterlife, because he knows that she's in heaven (when you die, your spirit visibly moves to one area or the other).  He has to have true faith, or he won't be able to join her, but he can't get over his anger.  The concept is intriguing, but the story never really holds together for me, and none of the characters are particularly likable or interesting.  \\"Stitchery\\" is just a rather dull story of a southern woman who can \\"stitch\\" people back together again once they have died, her two-headed lover, and a \\"granny\\" that she bought who knits wasted time together into a tapestry.  Again, some of the concepts are intriguing but the story itself isn't very interesting.<br />Overall, though, I would certainly recommend getting this book.  It has a great mix of stories, mostly well-told (and really, you should expect a clunker or two in any collection) with a nice mix of \\"name\\" authors and new people.

US	50332419	R2R8HQN9QJMB91	0061020672	469869447	Sourcery	Books	2	2	8	N	N	Magic from the Source	Sourcery, the fifth Discworld novel by Terry Pratchett, has many of the problems that Pratchett's earlier books had but shows a few signs of his breaking out into the Pratchett that I'm familiar with.  Considering that Mort was the fourth book and was very good, I can only say that Sourcery is a step back, however.  For the most part, it's a very hard 270 pages to get through.<br />While I give Sourcery two stars, it is a better book than Equal Rites, the only other Discworld book that I gave two stars to.  It's much more like 2.75 stars, if that were possible.  This is for three reasons: The Librarian, Nijel the hero in training, and Conina, the thief who finds Rincewind.  The Librarian is an ape who used to be a human wizard, until a magical accident lost in history turned him into an ape.  He found that he likes it better as an ape, and has refused any attempts to turn him back.  When Coin comes to take over, the Librarian must safeguard all of the magical texts in the University before Coin can destroy them.  It's amazing how much characterization that Pratchett can give him when the only thing he can say is \\"Oook.\\"  However, his actions give him a certain nobility.  He safeguards the Patrician of the city when Coin turns him into a lizard.  While he's barricaded himself in with his books, he's not above showing Rincewind what he needs to do in order to save everything.<br />Conina and Nijel are the other two saving graces.  Pratchett does great things with his characterization of these two.  Conina is a thief and warrior who wants to hide her lineage and just be a hairdresser.  However, the fantasy conventions of her profession are too powerful for her.  When she's surrounded, she can't bring herself to surrender, no matter how much she wants to.  Instead, she must kick some tail.  She's very dismissive of Rincewind when she finds out how incompetent he is, but she still feels responsible for him and helps him out whenever she can.  Nijel is young warrior still getting his feet wet in this hero business.  He has read the manual, but he doesn't have much practical experience.  When things start to get out of hand, he always retreats to what the book says.  His naivete is very touching at times, and very funny at other times.<br />The only bad thing about the two of them, and this brings to mind the first problem in the book, is the \\"romance\\" that starts between them.  Conina finds herself drawn to Nijel, and Nijel to her.  In Nijel's case, it's obviously a bit of the warrior convention: the hero gets the girl, who falls all over him.  However, it doesn't fit Conina's characterization at all, and the scenes where they make eyes at each other just seem too unbelievable.  Then Pratchett seems to dismiss the whole thing, having Conina make a couple of harsh comments to Nijel.  Finally, at the end, it comes back again, out of the blue.  It feels completely arbitrary.<br />The characterization of the rest of the cast is almost as bad.  None of the other characters are really developed.  Coin and the wizards fulfill their roles, but that's about it.  The wizards are scheming back-biters, but that's the extent of their characters for the most part.  The Sariph of Al Khali is fairly one-note as well, playing the stereotypical Sultan of Arabia with harem who, while he compliments women extensively, is only interested in them telling him stories.  He's not very interesting, and I didn't find him very funny.  Every time there's a woman present, he finds himself making lavish compliments (\\"Has anyone told you that your neck is as a tower of ivory.\\")  He drinks a lot.  But that's about it.  There is a genie who is amusing at times (\\"Let's do lunch!\\"), but he starts to wear thin as well after awhile.  Rincewind is just Rincewind, a coward who ends up doing the job despite himself.  I have never really cared for him that much (with the exception of The Last Continent) because I don't find him that funny.  And the intelligent luggage is just annoying, and it doesn't do anything interesting in this book.  It just takes up space.<br />Other characters are in the book just for the jokes they can provide, a failing that happens a lot with early Pratchett.  The Four Horsemen are the best example.  While the most prominent member is hilarious as always (Death, of course), the other three are there just for a long-running joke about being in a bar and forgetting what they're supposed to do.  While it's amusing for a time, it starts to grate when Pratchett keeps coming back to them and the same thing occurs.<br />All in all, this book is one to skip unless you're a completist.  It's too bad, too, because Rincewind as a concept is interesting.  However, of the four Rincewind books I've read, only one has been any good.  I'll be giving the other two a try, but I'm not holding my breath.st annoying, and it doesn't do anything interesting in this book.

US	50332419	R3KUMNA6UU9GBV	006105691X	114801696	Maskerade (Discworld )	Books	5	22	26	N	N	Phantom of the Disc	Maskerade, the eighteenth Discworld novel by Terry Pratchett, is a very funny parody of opera, and the Broadway show Phantom of the Opera more specifically.  You can certainly tell that Pratchett doesn't like opera, as he skewers it to within an inch of its life.  The parody of Phantom is right on as well, as Pratchett takes the story and turns it on its head in a most entertaining manner.<br />I'm not an opera fan, so I really appreciated how much Maskerade made fun of the whole genre.  I laughed out loud when the characters would make comments about how the story doesn't need to make sense as long as it's sung well, and I especially enjoyed how the villain kept \\"coming back to life\\" to make another statement after he's been killed, much like how a person who's killed in an opera often has time to sing a death chorus before succumbing.<br />This book is just hilarious all the way through.  I'm really becoming a fan of the Witches with the last two books (Lords & Ladies and this one).  Perhaps it's because I enjoy the personality clashes between Granny and Nanny.  They are so well written and so three dimensional that it's a joy to read about them.  They argue a lot, but there's an underlying affection beneath all of that which makes the arguments superficial.  It's Granny who instigates the trip to Ankh-Morpork after realizing what an unscrupulous publisher has done to her friend.  She doesn't like to see a friend get cheated.  There's also a compassion in both of them that is very touching.  It's even more surprising from Granny because she has such a gruff exterior.  Both of their interactions with Walter Plinge, the rather slow odd-jobs man who everybody at the Opera House ignores, are just brimming with this compassion.  It's not just the compassion, though, that makes them great characters.  They are very funny as well.  Especially good is the stagecoach ride where, by implied witchery, they end up having the coach to themselves while everybody else sits on top.<br />The other characters, while not as fully developed, still do their job very well.  Most of the opera players fill their assigned roles to a T.  There's Christine, who the Ghost takes a liking to.  Christine is excessively vain and dumb as a post, but everybody's fallen in love with her.  Meanwhile, Agnes is the talented singer, but she's on the large side, and thus can't get anybody to recognize that.  She's used to sing Christine's part for her, while Christine just looks good.  The new owner of the Opera House wants it to start making money, which can't happen with all of the strangeness going on.  There are many others as well.  None of them are terribly well-developed, but it's certainly good enough for this book.<br />I know that this book has received lukewarm reviews, but I found it incredibly funny.  The goings-on backstage at the Opera House were great fun, with intrigue and humour being mixed in liberally.  The ending of the book is extremely fitting, with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.  I know I was surprised by it.  The rest of the plot is quite smooth, with no glaring plot holes to be found.  I have found that the plots in the Witches books are a lot more straightforward then some of Pratchett's other books.  There are always weird and zany things going on, but they don't have the outlandish twists that populate some of the other ones.<br />You will find yourself laughing a lot throughout the book, especially if you are familiar with the genre.  If you live and breathe opera and can't stand to see it criticized, you may want to avoid this book.  If you have a sense of humour about it, or if you can't stand it, then this is the book for you.<br />And keep an eye out for the chandelier!

US	50332419	R2IQBRTN3M23B9	0061054895	746993744	Soul Music (Discworld)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Play that funky music...	Soul Music, the sixteenth Discworld novel by Terry Pratchett, is decidedly weaker then the other books in the Death sub-series.  Like the other Death books, Death has taken a break and something must be done in the meantime.  This time, however, it results in a disjointed narrative that isn't quite up to Pratchett's standards.<br />I'm of two minds on Soul Music.  It is tremendously funny, with wonderful homages to various rock and roll elements.  There are numerous Blues Brothers riffs, lots of Meat Loaf references, along with song lyrics and various band names that are parodied. \\"'A song about Great Fiery Balls. [...] Couldn't really make out the words, the reason bein', the piano exploded.'\\"  These sorts of references permeate the book, and make it a joy to read.  Some of the band names in the book include \\"We're Certainly Dwarfs (They Might be Giants), \\"Suck\\" (Kiss), \\"The Surreptitious Fabric\\" (The Velvet Underground).  I'm sure you can see where this is going.<br />On the other hand, the Death aspect of this story covers ground that's already been covered, to an extent.  Yet again, Death has decided to walk away from it all and visit humanity. Once again, somebody has to take over his job. Yet again, the person who does so has trouble with the \\"moral\\" aspect of it.  In Mort, Mort fell in love and couldn't bring himself to \\"kill\\" a little girl.  In this one, Susan has qualms about \\"killing\\" innocents and letting bad people live out a full life.  Why can't it be the other way around?  It feels very recycled, and it's only saved in Soul Music because Susan is interrupted by the onset of this strange music that's making everybody go weird.<br />The other problem with the book is the incredibly disjointed feeling that it has.  I used that word in my Reaper Man review as well, but that book was so good that it made up for it.  This time, however, it's even worse.  The Death storyline doesn't get much time, with only a couple of scenes with the Foreign Legion, then a couple of scenes back in Ankh-Morpork before finally being called back.  Susan's story takes forever to begin, as she is first approached by the Death of Rats, is skeptical, has it shown to her, explores Death's house, etc.  It got to the point at the beginning of the book that it came to a screeching halt whenever the story left the music and went back to Susan.<br />All of that being said, though, Soul Music is still a very entertaining book.  The characters are wonderful, with only Susan being slightly boring.  The other characters are either very well developed, or just in there for the sake of the joke (like the band that continually changes its name because, well, they suck and they can't get any recognition).  The three main band members (Imp, Glod and Cliff) are great, all being true to their racial characteristics (dwarves love gold, and so does Glod, etc), yet being wonderful personalities as well.  The wizards are back yet again, wreaking havoc with everybody and everything.  All but the Ridcully seem to be taken over by this new type of music, and the scenes between Ridcully and the Dean are priceless (the Dean acts like a child who is being denied while Ridcully is the father figure who is sending the Dean to his room without any supper).  The jokes come fast and furious whenever the wizards are around.  Death, when he is around, is as funny as always.  There's something about a personification of an aspect of life \\"trying to forget\\" that's really funny, even more so in Pratchett's execution of it.<br />Next to Reaper Man, this book comes up a bit short.  It's still entertaining, and you'll still enjoy it. I would definitely recommend it.  I would read a few Discworld books in between the two, though.  If you don't, you may find yourself feeling worse about Soul Music then you actually should.a couple of scenes back in Ankh-Morpork before finally being called back.

US	50332419	R3OQG08CL7746J	0345441214	266998237	Dragonstar	Books	2	43	45	N	N	Comet comet, burning bright	Dragonstar, by Barbara Hambly, is the conclusion to a series that never should have been.  This series is a sequel to Dragonsbane, one of the best books I have ever read.  It stood completely on its own and was wrapped up perfectly.  Instead of leaving it, years later she started this series.  Dragonstar, while much better than the first two books, still limps along unnecessarily, never earning the right to have been created in the first place.<br /><br />I have read that Barbara Hambly was going through a very tough personal time when she wrote the first two books in this series (Dragonshadow and Knight of the Demon Queen).  You could tell this because they were very depressing books.  Characters that I had grown to love in Dragonsbane were being put through a wringer that seemed more than just the normal \\"putting characters through conflicts to see how they come out.\\"  Massive doses of mistrust were placed between John and Jenny, wrenching their relationship apart.  Meanwhile, the story that she was trying to tell wasn't very interesting and seemed almost cliched at times.  There really isn't a new spin placed on the \\"demons trying to take over the world\\" concept.<br /><br />Dragonstar almost seems to have been written as an apology to fans for the gloom of the first two books.  Jenny and John are rescued quite quickly in the book, both immediately thinking about what they should have said to each other the last time they saw each other.  Both characters apologized to each other profusely in their minds, and then did so again when they finally met.  Once they are together, there are numerous references to the pain they have caused each other, and how now that they're together, they will make things back to normal between them.  When you take this book by itself, there is nothing wrong with all of that.  It's the earlier behaviour that's a bit out of character for them.  However, when you read the whole series, the change is extremely jarring.<br /><br />The only other semi-interesting character is Morkeleb.  He's a dragonshadow now, a dragon who has renounced magic.  The relationship between him and Jenny, the love that they share (though Morkeleb knows that it can never replace her love for John) is very sweet.  Morkeleb has a very un-dragonlike sense of humour as well.  In this book, he leads the other dragons in an attempt to help Jenny and John defeat the demons.  He does this for Jenny, but you get a sense that he does this for the good of the world as well, which is something a dragon would never do.  It's interesting to see the culmination of his transformation from dragon to what lies beyond.<br /><br />However, the same can't be said of any of the other characters.  Especially sad is Gareth, the regent and the man who came to John & Jenny so many years ago (in Dragonsbane) for help in defeating a dragon.  In this series, and especially this book, he's a shadow of his former self.  Some of this can be attributed to the fact that his \\"dead\\" wife has come back to life inhabited by a demon, but even that doesn't excuse how uninteresting he has become.  Events happen to him, but nothing seems to really affect him that much.  Then, there are the three demon characters; Folcalor, Amayon, and the Demon Queen herself.  None of them move much past the moustache-twisting villain.  They're evil for evil's sake (not surprising, for demons, but that doesn't make them intriguing enough to read about).  When your protagonists have nobody interesting to interact with, it makes for really laboured reading.<br /><br />The final problem with this book, and this may surprise people who have read my reviews of Hambly's Benjamin January series, is the extremely slow pace of the novel, mainly caused by her excessive description.  Usually, I love that trait in Hambly's writing.  However, I think what she's writing about has to be of interest in order to make it bearable.  In this case, it isn't, and thus the pace grinds to a halt as she's describing things.  The action scenes plod because of this, and the lengthy scenes where the plot is \\"developed\\" are almost unbearable.  The only thing that kept me reading was my loyalty to Hambly (probably my favourite author) and my loyalty to these characters.<br /><br />The plot is resolved, but an opening is left for a subsequent series of books.  I sincerely hope that, if Hambly does decide to give in to the temptation, she really thinks about it first.  This series almost destroyed my love for the original.  I don't think it could take much more of a beating.lod because of this, and the lengthy scenes where the plot is \\"developed\\" are almost unbearable.

US	50332419	R16NB5HWLWE2ZB	0553109359	756452714	Wet Grave (Benjamin January, Book 6)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Swimmin' through the bayous	I have been a big fan of the Benjamin January series, written by Barbara Hambly, ever since the beginning.  I've been anxiously awaiting Wet Grave since I had heard Hambly was working on it.  At long last, I finally managed to get my hands on it.  It was definitely worth the wait.  The book had both wonderful atmosphere and a very interesting plot.  Definitely one of Hambly's best.<br /><br />Wet Grave continues Hambly's string of wonderfully atmospheric books.  That is actually the main character in these January novels: the atmosphere.  Hambly uses vivid descriptions to completely set the scene.  You feel like you're in a really hot New Orleans in the middle of a sweltering summer.  You can almost feel the heat coming off of the page.  I love how she sets the scene even as actions are happening.  Ben and Rose may be walking down the street, discussing things and eating Italian ices, but Hambly will spend a paragraph or two describing the people and conditions around them.  You don't so much read this book as experience it.  If this sort of thing bothers you, then you should probably skip this one.<br /><br />The pace is leisurely.  When a book is badly written, that can be a detriment, as nothing seems to happen.  However, when it's as masterfully done as it is here, you don't seem to notice.  This isn't to say that there isn't a sense of drive to the narrative, because there is.  It's just that the pace allows the reader to absorb everything.  The only place that the pace drags is during the climax, when Hambly's penchant for description sometimes takes away from the action, making it drag to a halt periodically.  She should have toned it down a bit in the end, but I will gladly take this over a book that has a slam-bang climax but isn't interesting the rest of the time.<br /><br />The characters are another strength of this novel.  Some of the characters who have populated previous novels aren't in this one very much, like Olympe, or Ben's mother.  In fact, fans of Hannibal, Ben's longtime musician friend, will be disappointed to find out that he's not in this one at all.  However, this provides Hambly the opportunity to really explore Ben's relationship with Rose, as well as the character of Abishag Shaw, the head of the city's police.  Rose is a school teacher friend of Ben's who he loves.  She has been extremely tentative with Ben because she has an intense fear of men, having been raped a few years ago.  Ben has been very patient with her, though, throughout the series.  In Wet Grave, things finally begin to change.  Rose is a wonderful character, and really brings the book to life.  She has a wonderful sense of humour, as well as a dedication that makes her very endearing.  The relationship between these two characters is simply wonderful to see, and you find yourself rooting for them.<br /><br />Abishag Shaw, however, has to be the best character Hambly has created.  He's a Kentuckian who has moved down to New Orleans.  He's one of the few white people who actually will listen to somebody of colour.  He's a man who Ben considers a friend and a man of honour.  He's genuinely sorry that he can't help Ben with investigating Hesione's death, as he knows he has to instead investigate the murder of a plantation owner.  If he doesn't, he wouldn't have a position any more.  He's visibly torn about this, however.  When circumstances conspire to bring them together, however, Shaw trusts Ben to watch his back like no other white man would.  I think he sees a bit of a kindred spirit, as the French Creoles in New Orleans treat him almost as badly as they treat people of colour.  Hambly writes Shaw's character with a very deft touch that makes him very interesting to read about.  He really comes into his own in this book, as much of the action at the end concerns him and Ben, showcasing their relationship.<br /><br />Finally, one of the most interesting things about this series of books is the way it portrays race relations in this time period.  Ben is a free man, but he always has to carry his papers with him that declare this.  If he's out in the bayous and a plantation owner kidnaps him to work in his fields, there's nothing he could really do about it.  The relationships between Creoles and Americans, freed coloureds and slaves and white people, and the various other aspects of New Orleans society are vividly portrayed by Hambly, almost like a history lesson.  Ben's sister Dominique is a \\"kept\\" woman, a mistress of a plantation owner, as so many other free coloured women (such as Ben's mother) did in order to get by.  It's a very fascinating study of a culture.  It's very interesting to see who looks down on whom, who is \\"too black\\" to fit into a certain social class, that sort of thing.<br /><br />This book is an intriguing mystery, but it's so much more than that.  The characters are fascinating, the atmosphere is wonderful and it's a joy to read. You will lose yourself in this book.  It took me just as long to read this book (286 pages) as it did to read Harry Turtledove's last book (500 pages).  To me, that shows the depth and richness that Hambly provides.  I heartily recommend this book, but to experience the best that this series has to offer, you should almost start at the beginning.  There's certainly no need to, as it's perfectly understandable on its own.  However, the series is so rich that it deserves to be read in order.<br /><br />David Roye always has to carry his papers with him that declare this.

US	50332419	R1OBLOWD5RTGLH	0345444213	374292569	American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Stumbling into war	This is the second book in the American Empire series.  It is also a much better one than the first.  It does, however, have many of the previous book's faults.<br />The improvement between this book and the first in the series is very noticeable.  However, it is difficult to quantify.  One of my main complaints against the first book was that the \\"alternate\\" part of this history was too reminiscent of real history:  the Freedom Party was a poor man's Nazi Party, the massive inflation that hit the Confederacy was exactly the way it happened in real-world Germany after the First World War.  The Center Cannot Hold does a much better job of making things different and interesting.  There is a rebellion in Canada, tensions start flaring up between the Japanese and the United States.  A civil war erupts in Mexico.  All of this is wonderful news to the alternate history fan.  This is what we like.  Sure, some events are still the same (the Freedom Party is still the Nazi party, the Depression happens just like it did in reality), but there are enough differences this time to make it harder to guess what's going to happen.<br />With all that being said, there are still numerous faults in this book, which makes it so that I have to qualify my recommendation.  The writing is still very bland and boring at times.  Turtledove still has an annoying habit of emphasizing things by repeating them.  Every time we see Nellie Jacobs, there is some reference to her having killed the father or her oldest daughter in the previous series.  There is always a reference to how she really distrusts men, with the occasional reference to how this isn't quite always the case with her current husband, but still is most of the time.  It gets really old, really fast.  It gets even older if you've been reading the series since the beginning and getting this every time Nellie appears in the book.  The constant re-introduction of Turtledove's characters is his main writing fault, I believe.  I know that there are a lot of characters to keep track of, but either he should trust the reader to be able to keep track or lessen the number of characters in the book.<br />Secondly, some of the characters are still beyond useless and very uninteresting in the bargain.  I'll go back to Nellie again.  I have no idea where her storyline is going, but her entire family has to be the most annoying and boring characters around.  Their story doesn't seem to have anything to do with the ongoing story in the book.  This wouldn't be so bad if they were intriguing in some way, but they aren't.  They're just there, and they bring the book to a screeching halt every time they appear.  There is some sign at the end of the book that they may finally play some small part in the next book.  I hope that's true, as maybe they might finally get interesting.<br />Thankfully, most of the other characters have developed some sort of interesting story.  The intention seems to be to illustrate various aspects of life during this time period, and a reaction to the national events that happen.  Chester Martin, for example, is the everyman who has to deal with the Depression on the ground.  There are a couple of black characters who seem to be in the book mainly to give a black perspective to the rise of the Freedom Party.  At least they are interesting characters as well.  Turtledove is not afraid to kill some of his characters off, so you're never sure exactly what's going to happen to them.  One of the deaths, in fact, is so out of the blue that I initially wondered if Turtledove just couldn't find anything to do with him.  I then realized that it illustrated something about what was going on, and I admired Turtledove a lot more for it.  While he kills some of his characters off, he also introduces some new ones.  So far, these seem better then some of his original characters.<br />The final problem, and I have a feeling it's going to be a problem in the next book as well (it was a big one in the previous book) is that it covers such a long period of time that it seems very disjointed.  This book covers events from 1924 to 1933.  A lot of events happen offstage and we only see a reaction to them in hindsight.  Thus, there is no real flow to the book.  A clear indication of this is the last few chapters.  These chapters all take place in 1932-33 and talk about the coming election in the Confederacy, and the United States' reaction to it.  These chapters are gripping, even as you know what's going to happen.  There's a pace to them, a tension that makes you want to finish them.  This is missing from the earlier chapters, and definitely indicates the problem.<br />Thus, I must qualify my recommendation for this book.  It's much better than the first.  However, if you don't have an interest in alternate history (or even history in general, as I think this series would be of interest to the historian), then the writing of this book will really turn you off.  As it is, you have to almost ignore it because you want to know what's going to happen next.  This series seems to be doing almost nothing but setting up the coming Second World War.  Thus, you go through it feeling almost like you're running in place, waiting for something to happen.  I feel that I like this series a lot more than I should just because I like where the destination is.  Unfortunately, the journey is kind of a long, dry one, almost an endurance test.  Keep that in mind if you pick up this series.the previous book) is that it covers such a long period of time that it seems very disjointed.  This book covers events from 1924 to 1933.  A lot of events happen offstage and we only see a reaction to them in hindsight.  Thus, there is no real flow to the book.  A clear indication of this is the last few chapters.  These chapters all take place in 1932-33 and talk about the coming election in the Confederacy, and the United States' reaction to it.  These chapters are gripping, even as you know what's going to happen.  There's a pace to them, a tension that makes you want to finish them.  This is missing from the earlier chapters, and definitely indicates the problem.<br />Thus, I must qualify my recommendation for this book.  It's much better than the first.  However, if you don't have an interest in alternate history (or even history in general, as I think this series would be of interest to the historian), then the writing of this book will really turn you off.  As it is, you have to almost ignore it because you want to know what's going to happen next.  This series seems to be doing almost nothing but setting up the coming Second World War.  Thus, you go through it feeling almost like you're running in place, waiting for something to happen.  I feel that I like this series a lot more than I should just because I like where the destination is.  Unfortunately, the journey is kind of a long, dry one, almost an endurance test.

US	50332419	R2ZTRYESTEOMD9	0743412346	209608496	Sir Apropos of Nothing	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Fantasy turned on its head	Sir Apropos of Nothing, by Peter David, is a wonderfully funny fantasy novel that takes potshots at most of the clich&eacute;s in standard fantasy fiction, turning them on their heads.  It looks at the roles of the hero, sidekick, and villain, and asks \\"What if the sidekick isn't happy with his lot in life and wants to be the hero instead?\\"  The narrator, Apropos, is very self-aware, especially of his role in the proceedings.  And he's not happy about it.  The tale becomes a comedy of coincidences, missteps, and daring-do, and it's told wonderfully by the ever-talented David.<br />This book starts with one of the greatest opening lines I've read in awhile.  \\"As I stood there with the sword in my hand, the blade dripping blood on the floor, I couldn't help but wonder if the blood belonged to my father.\\"  Thus, Apropos is introduced, along with his tragic lineage.  I know it seems strange to call a book with something as horrific as a gang-rape a \\"comedy,\\" but David writes with such a deft touch that you will find yourself laughing at the appropriate times, and being horrified at the appropriate times.  He's that good of a writer, as he's shown in his other books and the comics he writes.  Apropos narrates the tale as if he's speaking to the reader, and when he's talking about both his being conceived and his childhood in general, he relates the tale in a very off-hand way, as if he's repressing his emotions about it a little bit.  Because of that, you don't get just a narration of the events as they take place.  Instead, you also get a bit of a psychological insight into him.<br />Apropos is not a very likable character.  He's self-centered, looking after his own skin when the going gets tough.  He gets involved in things because they will benefit him, not because it's \\"the right thing to do.\\"  A lot of times, he ends up doing the right thing anyway, or at the very least hiding the fact that he was looking after himself when he did it.  When his boyhood friend Tacit jumps into a clearing to save a weaver (wizard) from being burned at the stake by 20 villagers, Apropos holds back because that's suicide.  When Tacit is about to meet a heroic death, Apropos comes up with a plan that has as little risk to himself as possible.  Yet he's deemed a hero when it works.  If you're the type of reader who has to actually like the protagonist, then you may have to go elsewhere.<br />The other characters in the book are interesting as well.  The most important ones are Entipy, the princess that Apropos must rescue, and Tacit, Apropos' boyhood friend who he drives away and then meets again later in his life.  Tacit and Apropos' destinies are intertwined, and it's very interesting how Apropos deals with that.  It also isn't very likable, so see the paragraph above if that bothers you.  However, it's fitting, not only because of Apropos' personality, but also because it's about time a fantasy novel was written where the protagonist isn't all sweetness and light.<br />Entipy is a possibly psychotic arsonist who is suspected of burning down the convent where her parents had placed her.  The relationship that develops between her and Apropos on their journey also bucks all fantasy conventions.  Entipy is not a damsel in distress, but a very tough, but spoiled, young woman.  She develops a love-hate relationship with Apropos:  he thinks she's insane, she thinks he's an idiot and beneath her.  Not to mention the fact that she's waiting for her place in destiny to fall into place.  She doesn't realize that Apropos has hijacked it.  It's entertaining to watch Apropos slowly fall in love with her, even though he can't tell her that it all shouldn't be happening as it is.<br />Since Apropos is narrating the book directly, it is filled with wry asides and observations on life, people and society.  David is one of the best writers of this sort of thing.  You may find yourself laughing hard and then find that you agree with what Apropos is saying.  Or maybe you won't, but you'll still be laughing.  There are a couple of atrocious puns to watch out for if you hate that sort of thing.  Personally, I like them even when they're cringe worthy.  There's a military general saying \\"You all know my motto: Live fast.  Die young. And leave a good-looking corps.\\"  Fair warning to you pun-haters.<br />The other problem with the book, though, is something that David usually handles well.  I say above that he handles the combination of horror and comedy very well.  That is usually the case, but at times the juxtaposition is a little too jarring.  It's a bit understandable when Apropos is discussing his childhood, because you can tell he's repressing a bit, but certain events later on are pretty horrific and they jar with the light tone of the novel.  It's nothing really major and it doesn't ruin the enjoyment of the book, but it does make you stop for a few seconds before continuing.<br />For the most part, though, it is a wonderful book.  It makes great summer reading, as it doesn't feel very deep (even though, when you look at it, it is).  If you already like Peter David, you will love this.  If this is your first introduction to him, I think you'll still love it.  And it's a definite must-read for sword & sorcery fans everywhere.u won't, but you'll still be laughing.

US	50332419	R3E16OUSWJ20FF	0061056928	450739532	Lords and Ladies	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Where'd all these Elves come from?	Lords & Ladies, the 14th novel in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, is a wonderful return to Pratchett form for me.  It is laugh-out-loud funny and a wonderful parody of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream.  The Shakespeare allusions aren't quite as bewildering as they were in Wyrd Sisters either, which makes it a bit more accessible for the non-Shakespeare fan.<br /><br />This book was fantastic.  It was a very interesting blend of comedy and grimness.  In fact, it was probably the most mainstream plot that I've seen Pratchett produce.  The conflict between the Elves and Magrat (and the Elf Queen and Granny) is very straightforward and almost chilling.  The Elves are relentless in their pursuit of their victims.  Magrat has to do some very harsh things to save herself from them.  The Elves are almost unstoppable.  Then, there is the Granny's confrontation with the Queen, which is very much like other confrontations between heroes and villains.  Granny is captured and the Queen is just playing with her.  They discuss what's going to happen to Lancre when the Elves take over.  The Queen threatens her life.  That sort of thing.  These scenes are almost terrifying, and that's the first time I can ever say that Pratchett has done that to me.<br /><br />However, that doesn't take away from the comedy.  There are some truly funny scenes in this book that will make you laugh hard.  The Archchancellor of the the Unseen University of wizards decides that he should come to the wedding along with a few colleagues (including the Librarian, an orangutan that used to be human before a magical accident).  The scenes with the wizards, as usual, are just hilarious.  This includes everything from attempting to hire transport (they don't have enough money, so they have to say that the Librarian is a pet) to the Archchancellor's attempts to woo Granny.  As they say, hilarity ensues.<br /><br />The characters are simply wonderful.  It is such a difference between this book and Equal Rites.  Not only are they very funny, but you start to care for them as well.  Great strides are made in character development.  Magrat finally learns what she can do when she's pushed, when she stands up to the Elves.  Granny learns to respect Magrat just a little bit.  Nanny learns about Casanunda, the world's second greatest lover (\\"I try harder\\").  All of the witches seem a bit less testy, but still well within the character established for them in earlier books. Even the wizards get some development, which doesn't happen very often.  You learn a bit about the Archchancellor in this one as well.  Usually, the wizards are just around for comedy relief.<br /><br />Probably the best character, though, is Simon.  He's one of Nanny Ogg's sons, and he's basically everything at the castle.  He's the army, he's the servant, he's the herald, etc.  His attempts to get his mother and the other witches to follow royal protocol (like letting him announce their presence to the King) are very funny.  Even he gets some development, though, as he learns what it is to be a leader when he has to lead a rag-tag band against the Elves.<br /><br />There is only one thing wrong with this book.  The ending, again, is a bit lack-luster.  This time, it's also a bit anti-climactic.  It doesn't exactly come out of nowhere, as there is a bit of a set-up. However, I think it still needed a bit more.  I applaud Pratchett for trying to turn the clich&eacute;d ending to something like this on its head, but I think it needed a little more support.<br /><br />As far as the characters and the plot go, though, this was a classic book.  Not quite as good as Reaper Man (I don't know if he'll ever be able to top that), but still very high up on the list.  And ignore what Pratchett says at the beginning of the book.  While it does continue straight on from the previous book (which I haven't read), it is still very understandable without that.  In his little blurb at the beginning, Pratchett gives youall of the information you will need to understand this one.<br /><br />If you can't find Reaper Man, this one also makes an excellent entry into the Discworld universe.<br /><br />David Royis one.

I had to stop and think after reading this book.  Why didn't I like it that much?  Was it my mood at the time?  No, I don't think so, because I wasn't in the best mood when I read Reaper Man and Lords & Ladies either, yet I loved them.  Finally, I decided that, unusually for Pratchett, it just didn't do anything for me.<br />Drum Billet is a wizard who's dying.  Before Death comes for him, though, he wants to pass on his wizard staff and power.  This is done by finding the eighth son of an eighth son.  Drum Billet thinks he's found the perfect one and hurriedly does the deed before he finally expires.  One thing, though:  he didn't wait long enough to make sure of the sex of the new-born baby.<br />Granny Weatherwax is determined to see that Esk (the baby in question) grows up to be a witch, rather than a wizard.  Esk will never get into the wizards' university because women can't be wizards.  It just isn't done.  However, Esk starts manifesting power that's beyond being a witch and beyond Granny's ability to teach.  Esk really wants to become a wizard and seems to be losing control of her power, so Granny decides to take her there and see what will happen.<br />What follows is an adventure that takes them to the city of Ankh-Morpork, to the university, with a side-trip to the Dungeon Dimensions to ensure that the monsters that live there don't come into our reality.  And maybe, just maybe, some wizards will start to change their attitude to the \\"fairer sex.\\"  And sometimes, a staff is just a staff.<br />It really hurts to say this about a Terry Pratchett Discworld book, but I just didn't think it was very good.  It is the third in the series, and I wasn't a big fan of the first two, so perhaps he just hadn't hit his stride yet (I think he hit it with Mort, personally).  First of all, the book just isn't that funny.  None of the situations are exceptionally humorous.  Instead, most of the humour comes from Pratchett's narration.  Even that, though, is not up to his later power.  He makes some wry comments about gender issues, especially the prejudice against women in the workplace.  However, they just lie there, doing nothing and taking up space.<br />The characters aren't that interesting.  I was looking forward to the introduction of Granny Weatherwax (first read by me in Wyrd Sisters), but even that was a disappointment.  She doesn't have the same feel in this one as she does when she's with her coven.  You can see signs of it in her characterization (she's irascible and set in her ways), but she's not quite as tart as the Weatherwax I know.  It's almost like she needs somebody to play off to be \\"right.\\"<br />Esk suffers from being rather dull.  Is it because Pratchett can't write an 8 year old character?  I don't know.  I do know that she's rather flat and I didn't care about her situation.  I'm all for equal rights, but Esk's situation didn't push me any further along that path.  She's just there on the page with nothing to really hook you into caring about her.<br />One thing I shouldn't really hold against this book, though I feel I should mention it, is the wizard characters.  The main wizards (Archchancellor, Dean, etc) are different characters in this book than in subsequent books.  Unfortunately, since I've read many books containing the \\"new\\" characters, I found the original characters extremely wanting.  They weren't funny at all.  What I can hold against them, however, is that they were boring.  Archchancellor Cutangle is the most developed of them, and even he's not very well done.  He's there more to represent the unmovable force of male domination, and to show what happens when it meets the irresistible force of female determination.<br />I can say a couple of positive things about this book, however.  The beginning is probably the funniest part of the book, where the mix-up happens.  This part has Death in it, which already brings it up toa certain level.  Death is always ready to chime in with an interesting comment or two.  Secondly, Pratchett's descriptions of things are on the ball as always.  He has a wonderful narrative voice.  While the witty asides in this one aren't as good as some others, he still is an interesting read when he gets on a roll.  Unfortunately, when the characters come back onto the stage, the story grinds to a halt again.<br />I really hate to give a Pratchett book 2 stars.

US	50332419	R3U1KJKRFM80XO	0061020621	690753180	Reaper Man	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Death gets a life!	Reaper Man, the eleventh book in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, is probably the most moving and serious book I've read from Pratchett. It's also one of his funniest, which is definitely a good combination. It is a classic, and one of Pratchett's best. It's a moving story about Death (our good friend with the scythe), with a subplot that's almost as good but adds a lot to the humour and has a little something to say of its own.<br />It's a relatively short book (285 pages), considering what all is going on in it. Death's story has a poignancy that doesn't happen very often in Pratchett's books. He usually has some good social commentary, but not this sort of character deepness. The relationship that develops between Mrs. Flitworth and him is very reminiscent of some western movies. She's the homesteader and he's the hired hand. She's initially suspicious of him, but she needs the help. As time goes by, she becomes more and more trusting, letting him stay in the house during the evening (though he still must sleep in the barn!). Death, of course, is wonderful with a scythe, which is an immense help during the harvest. I enjoyed this story immensely, with Death (or Bill Door, as he calls himself) learning to how to fit in with the locals and generally learning what it is to be human. The ending of this particular storyline is wonderfully moving, with Death showing just how much he has learned (and yet, how much he still has to learn). It's almost enough to bring a tear to your eye.<br />Almost as moving is the story of Windle Poons. After fifty years of being an invalid, he's finally able to live again. Windle is an irascible, yet still very endearing, figure.  It's interesting to see the life that flows back into his body even though he's dead. He joins a group called the Fresh Starters, which is a group that's fighting for the rights of the undead. While he doesn't really believe this is necessary, this is a group of people who fully accept him, which he hasn't had for awhile.<br />Windle's story provides the majority of the humour in this novel, and it does it very well. While Death's story has it's funny moments, they are more amusing then laugh-out-loud funny.  Windle's story, however, has the sequence where the other wizards try to \\"help\\" Windle with his problem (the problem being that he's no longer dead). They even go so far as to try to bury him at a crossroads in Ankh-Morpork (at rush hour, even). The antics of the wizards are just hilarious. Once the life force problem presents itself, with killer trolleys running rampant through the city, the wizards decide that only they can stop it. Thus ensue many action movie parodies, including a wonderful riff on Aliens. There has never been so much testosterone evident at the wizards' university. They obviously don't know what they're doing, but the characters are so well drawn and so funny that it makes for great reading.<br />Pratchett's wonderful characters are the other highlight of the book. I've already mentioned the wizards. The great thing about the wizards in this book, as opposed to Moving Pictures, is that they are actually central to the plot. The other characters are equally wonderful. The Fresh Starters was started by Reg Shoe, a zombie who discovered that the recently dead were not being treated very well by society. Also included as members are: a shy boogeyman, a banshee with a speech impediment (so she slides a piece of paper saying \\"ooooooweeehooooooo\\" under the door), two vampires and a wolf who becomes a werewolf every full moon. These characters go great together, and when they try to pitch in and help Windle solve the trolley problem, the events add to the fun. This has to be the best bunch of characters that Pratchett has created.<br />There are only two niggling things about this book, however. The first is that the two stories don't really mesh that well. Sure, Death's story causes the other, but when the book bounces back and forth between the two stories, it gets a very disjointed feel that's a bit annoying. Secondly, the climax of the Death story is a bit rushed. Similar to Mort, it seems to happen too fast with not enough set up. I think it would have benefited from a few extra pages.<br />Still, the pluses of this book far outweigh the minuses. This book is classic Pratchett, and should be read as soon as possible.

It's an intriguing combination and one I've been awaiting for quite awhile.  The story, however, doesn't do them much justice.  It suffers from a stock alien race, tired writing, and is damnably depressing to boot.<br />Don't start reading Amorality Tale if you're already down in the dumps.  There is so much death, destruction, and evil atmosphere that it could bring down Kathie Lee Gifford.  The book almost wallows in it at times.  I see the intent behind it, which is to make the alien Xhinn a very vile race, worthy of what the Doctor has to do to stop them.  However, it doesn't come off very well and just lies there like a lead balloon.  Not only that, most of the people who die in this book are ciphers, so we don't really have anything invested in them.  It's like reading death statistics in the newspaper.  Sure, it's sad, but why should we care on an emotional level?  Bishop tries to give humanity to some of them, but it's so superficial that it doesn't work.<br />The characters, for the most part, are a bunch of cliches.  There's the couple who never really loved each other, but come together at the time of greatest crisis.  The gangsters are mostly stock characters, speaking their gangster lines like in most movies of the type.  Tommy's a mean guy, but loves his mom and has a few noble qualities.  There's the hard-done-by woman across the street with three kids and no husband, with no prospects in life but getting by.  There's the thug with the heart of gold, who really doesn't want to be doing what he's doing, but keeps it up out of loyalty.  We've seen all of this before.<br />The regular characters don't suffer quite as much, though I thought Sarah was slightly out of character.  A bit of a relationship develops between her and Tommy that I don't see the \\"real\\" Sarah allowing to happen.  Sarah is an activist and a feminist.  She realizes that she has to adapt to the time period she's in, but that shouldn't change her actual attitude.  I don't buy the grudging respect that she develops for Tommy, even as she hates his exterior.  I can see the \\"necessary evil\\" aspect of allying with him against the Xhinn, but not the rest of the relationship.<br />The Doctor and Sarah do have some good scenes together, however, and Bishop does get their relationship almost exactly right.  The Doctor knows that he can't change history and that he has to balance stopping the Xhinn with allowing the people who actually died in the smog to carry out their destiny.  Sarah initially resists this, feeling that the Doctor is being heartless, but she begins to understand the position the Doctor is in.  It's a bit heartwrenching.  While it does add to the general depressing atmosphere that clouds the book, in this case I think it's effective.  The Doctor's character does suffer a bit from Bishop using too many of his mannerisms from the TV series, however.  While the character should be recognizable, he shouldn't be just a collection of Third Doctor cliches.  He uses the Venusian martial arts just a little too much for my taste.  It's become a stereotype and I wish Bishop would have avoided it a little bit.<br />Finally, we come to the Xhinn.  I am getting tired of monolithic races who want to invade Earth just for the sake of invading Earth.  Here we have another race that just colonizes planets for the heck of it, with no real motivation otherwise.  Again, this is a Third Doctor clich&eacute; (though the rest of the TV series suffered from it a bit too).  Again, it's one that I wish Bishop would have avoided.  They're almost like a force of nature rather than a race of intelligent beings.  It's a bit more understandable in the TV series, but in novels, the villains should be fleshed out more.  As it is, they're just in the book to be evil.<br />Ultimately, this book fails on a couple of levels.  It isn't very entertaining, and it's not very interesting, either.  There are lots of scenes of death if that's your bag.  Otherwise, though, I'd avoid it.  The Third Doctor and Sarah deserve a better story.<br />*Note:  I did appreciate the historical note about the real London killer smog.

One thing that Doctor Who, ever since the television series, has been good at is ripping off...ahem, I mean paying homage to other genres.  Trading Futures is pretty blatantly a James Bond pastiche, even down to the cover (with silhouetted women posing provocatively and a couple of other exciting scenes, all in a big target image).  The question is, is it a good pastiche?  Thankfully, yes it is.<br />This is a book that never stops.  It's certainly not introspective at all, moving from action set piece to action set piece.  It's kind of surprising coming from Lance Parkin, who usually has more event-driven, monumental books.  The scene shifts drastically from a resort on the Mediterranean Sea to Athens to California to Toronto and to Russia, with a few places in between.  You almost have to stop and catch your breath at times.  There's a lot of gunfire, robotic tanks and other robots, and daring leaps.  Personally, I rather enjoyed all of this, but if you don't, you may want to skip this book.<br />Not to say that characterization is neglected, though it's not as good as most of Parkin's books.  The Doctor and Anji have plenty to do (though, in Bond tradition, Anji spends a lot of time dressed in a bikini).  Both of them are very well-characterized, with Parkin capturing almost perfectly the Doctor's combination of whimsy and intelligence.  Anji actually uses some of her economics background to work out part of what's going on, and she has some marvelous scenes with Baskerville, the man with the time machine to sell.  Fitz is pretty good too, with an often hilarious sequence where he's mistaken for the Doctor and has to try and improvise.<br />The other characters are also fairly good.  Cosgrove is a British agent who is trying to get the time machine for the Eurozone.  Or is he?  He is given some great motivation and it's very interesting as things unfold around him and the reader gets to find out what's really going on.  Baskerville is given some great scenes as well.  He's very well-rounded and not just a dastardly villain.  Malady Chang is a CIA agent that becomes attached to the Doctor.  She's a little bit more one-note, but she is given some interesting things to do.  The other minor characters don't suffer too badly, but they're not as complete as these.<br />The plot is also very intriguing.  The differing factions can be confusing sometimes, but it's usually pretty easy to figure out what's going on.  There's lots of humour to go with the action.  Watching Fitz try to talk his way out of trouble is always a treat, and there's some great byplay between the Doctor and Malady as well.  The only thing that's a bit too cute for me is the name of the alien race:  a race of alien rhinos called Onihrs.

The other minor characters don't suffer too badly, but they're not as complete as these.<br />The plot is also very intriguing.  The differing factions can be confusing sometimes, but it's usually pretty easy to figure out what's going on.  There's lots of humour to go with the action.  Watching Fitz try to talk his way out of trouble is always a treat, and there's some great byplay between the Doctor and Malady as well.

US	50332419	R26RVWGCOCM4UV	056353849X	412992449	Palace of the Red Sun (Doctor Who)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Basic Who	Christopher Bulis is well-known inside the Doctor Who mythos as an author who writes very traditional Doctor Who stories.  There won't be any radical characterization, no big changes in the Who universe, or anything like that.  His characters are usually one-note and it's his plots that either make the book worth reading or not.  Thankfully, Palace of the Red Sun is one of his better ones.<br />The TARDIS lands in what seems like an idyllic garden setting.  The red sun beats down on it without much heat, giving a very pleasant atmosphere.  The Doctor and Peri decide to stay and have a little bit of a holiday.  The Doctor, however, is intrigued because he can't get the TARDIS controls to tell him where they are.  Peri decides to wander around the garden a bit, and is met by a talking bear with a hat (think Paddington).  This bear wants to play a game, and ends up leading her into a pit that's impossible for her to get out of.  The Doctor goes to get a ladder, but when he comes back, Peri's gone!<br />Meanwhile, Glavis Judd, the self-proclaimed protector of the galaxy, has invaded the planet of Esselven to rid it of its supposed tyrants.  Unfortunately, the royal family manages to get away, and leave all of the governing documents in a vault that can only be opened by the DNA signature of a royal family member.  Judd spends the next year trying to track them down.  The intrepid news reporter, Dexter Dynes, has been following the story from the beginning, hoping to get lots of exciting (and violent) news footage.  When Judd thinks he's finally tracked them down, Dynes couldn't be happier.<br />What do these two plots have to do with each other?  The story becomes a race against time as the Doctor tries to find the \\"Lords\\" of these gardens, and tries to save them against an invasion that they don't seem to realize is coming.  Peri has to deal with the people who live outside of the gardens.  Who can they trust, when nothing on this planet is what it seems?<br />The plot behind Palace of the Red Sun is actually very interesting.  The two plots initially don't seem to have anything to do with one another, but Bulis does tie it together well.  The idea of a \\"Protector\\" going around and invading places for their own good is kind of interesting, though it doesn't seem that realistic, especially as Bulis presents it.  The idea that numerous worlds could see what Protector Judd has done to other worlds and still want him to \\"save\\" them is, to me, a little ridiculous.  I know that some people would welcome it, but this many?<br />The relationship between the garden idea and this militaristic plot is very intriguing, though.  Bulis does make the transitions from one to the other very well.  The Doctor and Peri  are hard-pressed to figure out what's happening.  The plot has a certain \\"what the heck is going on?\\" element to it that is not always done well.  Here, it is.  Just when you think you've got it figured out, Bulis throws a bit of a twist in.  The final couple of twists are really interesting, though, as the two plots dovetail rather nicely and are finally resolved.<br />It's too bad the same can't be said of the characters.  This has always been Bulis' weakness.  The characterization of the Doctor and Peri are passable, but that's because we have numerous books and TV episodes to keep in mind as we're reading the book.  The original characters suffer a great deal.  Judd is a ruthlessly efficient tyrant who will do whatever it takes to achieve his goals.  Dynes just wants the story and to have as much violent footage for his broadcast as possible.  There is a \\"robot starts becoming sentient\\" bit that is straight out of many science fiction ideas (though the robot is one of the more interesting characters in the book).  The inhabitants of the garden fulfill their assigned roles, but do little else (though there is a bit of a reason for that in story terms, I won't say what it is).  Basically, they're all very bland and uninteresting.<br />Dynes is a character from one of Bulis' previous Who novels, The Ultimate Treasure.  There really isn't any reason for him to be in this book other than at the whim of the author.  Bulis tries to make a point about how the public seems to lap up violent news images even as they decry the media for broadcasting them.  However, the point is so heavy-handed that my head hurt from the mallet Bulis hit it with.  It's too bad, too, because Dynes certainly seemed to have potential as a worthwhile character.  However, in a Bulis book, there are no shades of grey, which always make the best characters.<br />Thankfully, though, the plot is intriguing enough to make up for it.  This is a very lukewarm recommendation, but ultimately I would recommend the book.  I don't think I would make it your first Dr. Who book, though.ng.<br />Dynes is a character from one of Bulis' previous Who novels, The Ultimate Treasure.

The Shakespearean allusions were a bit above my head without reading the online annotations, but even without that I found I was laughing a great deal.  Plus, it has an interesting story playing on the old \\"lost son of a king\\" clich&eacute;.<br />The three witches are my least favourite of the sub-series that Pratchett has in Discworld.  Of course, that's because the other two (City Watch, Death) are so good, not because the witches are bad.  They are still well worth the price of admission into their stories.  Granny Weatherwax is a curmudgeon of sorts, often speaking of how the new people are \\"getting ideas\\" put in their head.  \\"'Modern,' said Granny Weatherwax with a sniff.  `When I was a gel, we had a lump of wax and a couple of pins and had to be content.  We had to make our own enchantment in them days.'\\"  She doesn't understand a lot of new things, like theatre.  In fact, one of the funniest scenes in the book is when Magrat and Nanny Ogg take her to the theatre and she tries to intervene in what's happening on stage.<br />Nanny Ogg and Magrat are wonderful creations as well.  Nanny is old, but she's a lot more open-minded.  She can understand a lot of the new ideas going around.  She's also good at what she does.  Another great scene is when Felmet and his wife try to torture her.  Let's just say it doesn't quite work.  Magrat is the young witch, who thinks that symbols are very important.  When they try to summon a demon to help them, she's the one who thinks that they need the \\"proper\\" ingredients in order to do it, rather than the makeshift ones that the other two bring in.  Together, the threesome is a very entertaining bunch.<br />The incidental characters are marvelous as well.  There's the Fool, who only became a Fool because it was a family tradition.  He really hates it.  There's Hwel, the dwarf who never took to mining, so he became a playwright.  Death makes a few appearances as well, also making his stage debut in a riotous manner.  There isn't a wasted character in the bunch, and they are all well-rounded individuals who are interesting to read about.<br />The plot is excellent as well.  The only thing that marred it for me was the extensive Shakespearean allusions, and that's only because I didn't understand half of them.  There were times when I knew I was missing a joke, which became a bit frustrating. It's one thing to miss a joke and not even see it, but when you see it but don't understand it, it's a bit of a letdown.  Still, if it encourages people to go back to the original plays and read them, then so much the better.  The book doesn't suffer for all of this, though.  It is still a very entertaining read without it.<br />This is a wonderful beginning to the Three Witches sub-series.  I look forward to reading more of them.

US	50332419	RR563UU7D78OL	006102063X	51458965	Moving Pictures	Books	3	11	11	N	N	Cinematic Disc	Moving Pictures, the 10th Discworld novel written by Terry Pratchett, has the distinction of being the first one with which I've been a bit disappointed.  All of the typical elements of a Discworld book are still there:  witty satire on an aspect of society, humour, and weird situations.  They just don't come together as a whole. It was a bit difficult to get through as a result, because I did become bored at certain points.  Pratchett includes a few characters that don't have much to do with the plot, but instead are there for a one-off joke.  This seemed to pad the book far more than the joke, while amusing, was worth.  One character in particular falls into this category:  he's there to make a joke about Victor's exit examination; then later on in the book, he keeps trying to go out for a night on the town, but keeps getting stymied.  Again, the joke is amusing, but the pages devoted to it seem to be a waste.  Another example is the antics of some of the wizards.  The situations that they get themselves into are hilarious, I must admit. But as part of the narrative, they don't merge well.<br />The rest of the book contains some wonderful skewering of Hollywood and the movie business.  I loved how Dibbler wanted to add elephants to everything, with mass battle scenes (with different people galloping by in take after take because they only have a couple of horses) and romance where there wasn't any before.  Theda (who calls herself Ginger) and Victor heat up the screen with kiss after kiss, and everybody assumes that they're lovers (hey, it happened on screen, right?).  Who cares if something didn't really happen, it will look exciting!<br />The main characters were less memorable than Pratchett's characters usually are.  I found both Victor and Ginger to be kind of bland.  This is ironic, considering how they are perceived as almost larger than life by the people who watch these movies.  In the book, however, they are a trifle boring.  I didn't get any sense of chemistry between them, like I did with William and Sacharissa in The Truth.  They are capable in their roles as a vehicle for Pratchett's satire, but as characters themselves they fall a bit short.<br />Thankfully, some of the other characters make up for this deficiency, and they prevent the book from sliding into tedium.  Dibbler is wonderful as a man who has let too much power go to his head.  He's a director that thinks he knows everything (he has, after all, run a highly \\"successful\\" business selling \\"sausages\\" in a bun).  He has some of the best lines, and if he doesn't get his elephants, he's going to be very unhappy!  Gaspode, the talking dog, is another winning character, and I was glad to see how he was introduced.  Pratchett defies logic a little bit in keeping Gaspode talking when the other animals stop, but he's such a great character in subsequent books that it's worth it.<br />Every time I thought of putting this book down, something funny or interesting happened.  Unfortunately, it's not like a Pratchett book to ever make me have that feeling in the first place.  Still, it is worth getting through it. I don't think you'll feel you've wasted your time reading this.  However, if you start the series with this book, know that it's one of the weaker ones and you can move up from here.

US	50332419	ROQJ8HGULUKC	0061020680	116769240	Mort	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Being Death's apprentice ain't all it's cracked up to be	Mort, the 4th Discworld book by Terry Pratchett, is one of the funniest Discworld books out there.  It's a hilarious book that's missing some of the social commentary that permeates his books later in the series.  You don't miss it, though, as you continue to laugh out loud at some of the shenanigans.  Only a weak ending prevents it from being the best book of the bunch.<br />Death takes on an apprentice. Mort, the unlucky chosen one, has a bit of trouble settling into his role.  It's not very fun to be present when people leave the mortal coil.  One time, however, he spies a princess (who can actually see him as well, even though people aren't supposed to be able to) and is very attracted to her.  Unfortunately for him, this attraction leads him to try and change the course of destiny, and Mort finds that it's a lot harder to do then it looks.  The princess finds out that it's quite hard to live when you're supposed to be dead.  Death doesn't seem to notice all of this as he's busy trying to experience humanity.  But when he finds out, Mort may wish he hadn't.<br />I really enjoyed this book.  Death has always been my favourite character in Pratchett's books, so I decided to start reading the books that are actually about him.  Mort is the first, and I can now see why I've always liked the character.  Death has a dry wit about him, but he's always matter-of-fact when he's doing his job.  He tries to impart that onto Mort, with limited success. I like the fact that he always speaks in capital letters LIKE THIS, thus giving him a real presence when you read him.  It's even better when he's out learning about humanity, sitting in a bar and lamenting about the fact that he has no friends.  The dissonance between this very human feeling and his powerful voice is really neat.<br />The other characters in Mort are also wonderful.  There's Ysabell, Death's adopted daughter who he's obviously trying to pair Mort with.  She's feisty, never slipping into the stereotypical female role.  Albert shines as Death's servant, a man who's not all he appears to be.  When things finally let loose with Albert, it's both powerful and funny how it happens.  There's Keli, the princess that Mort tries to save.  She's a petulant child, even more so when people can't seem to remember that she's not supposed to be living.  Finally, there's Cutwell, the wizard that Mort enlists to help him learn to walk through walls and Keli employs to make people remember her.  All of these characters are complete and well-rounded, with none of them missing a beat.  Their interactions are marvelous and the jokes come out of the characters rather than at the expense of the characters.  Heck, even Rincewind, the incompetent wizard from the first books, makes an appearance!<br />There's more to this book than the characters, though.  The plot is simple, but very good.  While there's not much commentary in this book, it does make a bit of a statement about how powerful an emotion love can be.  It also shows what a curse being human can be, as Death loses himself in the experience.  He even lowers himself to become a fry cook at one point, just to see what it's like.  No insult intended to fry cooks, but when you're the anthropomorphic projection of an aspect of life, then you have lowered yourself when you start working a kitchen.  The plot moves quickly, with little padding.  There are no unnecessary characters placed in the book just to make a joke, which is a sin Pratchett starts to commit in later books.  When somebody appears, you know they're going to have an impact.<br />The only bad thing about this book is the ending.  It's very arbitrary, and seems to go against the rest of the book.  It seems to come out of nowhere, just being used as an excuse to end the book.  The final conflict is resolved way too quickly and neatly.  It's almost like Pratchett knew how he wanted to end the book, but couldn't figure out how to get there.  It makes sense, but only if you reacha bit.<br />Still, it's well worth the time spent getting to the ending.  The jokes are great, Death is wonderful and you'll really love reading about him.  I can't wait to read the next Death book and see what happens.  This book is a wonderful place to start your Discworld experience, being the start of a subset within the Discworld series.

US	50332419	R1R7TLDX0VL5MX	0061031321	461879486	Thief of Time (Discworld)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Where has all the Time gone?	Thief of Time, the 26th Discworld novel written by Terry Pratchett, is much more metaphysical than most of the previous books (other than Small Gods, perhaps).  The book is so full of ideas that it's almost bursting, which has both its good and bad points.<br />This is yet another winner by Pratchett.  It's nowhere near as good as The Truth, the last Discworld book I read.  However, it is really good.  Pratchett deals with a lot of large issues, such as the nature of time and space.  He's never really been this metaphysical before.  Even Small Gods was a bit minor compared to this.  It can get a bit confusing at times, which is one strike against the book.  If you're not that interested in these kinds of issues, then the book can drag a little.  It's still worth it, though, for the many riffs on other, less \\"grand\\" things.  There's a James Bond riff, a comment on the state of the educational system, even a parody of martial arts movies.  You will find yourself laughing despite yourself.<br />I think Pratchett does a nice job of balancing everything in this one.  If you've read my review of Small Gods, you'll know that I thought that it was missing the humour that is Pratchett's trademark, and it suffered a bit.  This time, though, he's got the mix right.  There is plenty to laugh at, but there is plenty of subtext as well for the serious reader.  I really enjoyed reading about Lu-Tze and the sacred text that he follows which is based on the words of a boarding house manager (\\"Ah, but is it not said, `There is a time and place for everything?'\\").  This isn't just funny, but turns a series of cliches on its head.<br />Pratchett doesn't forget the characters in this book, either.  In fact, it's so full of characters that sometimes they start stepping on each other.  All of them have their funny hook.  The Abbott of the monastery, who is immortal only through serial reincarnation (and right now he's just been born again so he's got a baby's urges), is probably the funniest.  There's also Susan, who has come to terms with the fact that being the granddaughter of an anthropomorphic projection isn't all it's cracked up to be.  She wants to lead a simple life as a teacher, but she finds out that sometimes you have to get involved in things in order to make the world go right.<br />There are really too many characters to mention all of them, but suffice it to say you'll be entertained by them all.  They are all unique characters with wonderful character hooks that get you to care about them.  There's a nice mix of characters we've seen before and new characters as well.  Don't worry, though.  All of the returning characters are explained enough that you will be able to follow along.  There is a tiny reference to Small Gods as pertains to Lu-Tze, but it's not that important if you don't get it.<br />The plot of this book is very large.  At 427 pages, it's very long for a Discworld book, as Pratchett has a lot to say on the subject.  There are times that it drags, and unfortunately one of those times is when everybody's in the thick of the problem.  There are some funny moments in that sequence, but for some reason the book seems to come to a screeching halt occasionally and it takes a while to get going again.  There are one or two other sequences where this happens as well (such as when Lobsang stops a timestorm from getting out of hand).  In retrospect, I can see the value of these scenes, so I don't think of this as padding.  The writing just lets it down so that it feels like padding as you're reading it.<br />The concepts in this book, though, are marvelous.  I love the idea of taking time from somewhere it's not needed and putting it where it is needed (have you ever wondered, \\"where has the time gone?\\"  It probably got used somewhere else while you were doing something boring).  I loved most of the metaphysical and philosophical issues that Pratchett addressed.  If this isn't your thing, then I think you'll still be entertained by the book.  Perhaps you can just skim through the philosophy.  If you do, though, you will miss a lot of the meat of the book.<br />I highly recommend this book with the above caveat.  However, while everything is explained within the book, I would certainly not recommend that you start reading the series with this one.  It's not necessarily typical of the Discworld books, and there's a lot of stuff that you won't get the nuances for if you haven't read at least some of the other books. The rest of the series is worth it, though, so I definitely suggest you do that.y the book.  Perhaps you can just skim through the philosophy.

Fortunately, unlike the previous Who book, Hope, this plot is interesting enough to compensate for it.<br />The Doctor, Anji, and Fitz arrive on an unnamed planet after the TARDIS is forced to land by some unknown force.  The crew gets taken to Isolation Station Forty, an outpost in a very strange war.  Neither the Plutocrats nor the Defaulters have been able to make any progress in the war in over 100 years.<br />Another unusual thing about this war is that Time itself is used as a weapon.  Areas of accelerated time (where a person can age, die, and turn to dust in the space of seconds) and decelerated time (where a second of time can last days) dot the landscape.  Isolation Station Forty is a research base where the residents are trying to send soldiers back in time to break the impasse.  Unfortunately, something appears to have come back with them during the tests.  Something that could make the war itself meaningless.<br />I loved Jonathan Morris' first Who book, Festival of Death.  It did wonderful, twisty things with time and causality.  This time, Morris tells a more straightforward tale, and it's not as good.  The lack of interesting characters detracts from the plot instead of the wonderful plot making up for the lack of good characters.  Don't get me wrong:  the story contains plenty of strange, interesting things.  It's still a good book.  But Morris' weakness for original characters asserts itself.  Hopefully, if he writes a third book, he will be able to rectify this weakness.  He does try to give some of them a bit of back story, but it just doesn't seem to work.<br />The main characters are a bit better.  The Doctor is the best of the bunch, with his manic energy manifesting itself as he tries to solve the problem.  He's a virtual dynamo as he goes from situation to situation.  Unfortunately, there are times where he's not like this, where he's instead tired and weak.  This ties in with the ongoing storyline about his illness, and makes a nice counterbalance to his energetic periods.  It also provides a nice clue to the ending.<br />Anji and Fitz aren't nearly as good, but they are passable.  There is a brief reference to Hope, which gives some nice moments to Anji.  But mostly, they are pretty basic.  They react to events, wondering what's going on, and having to have the Doctor explain it to them.  There isn't a lot that is new to their characters.  However, they are definitely in character, and what there is of them in this book is pretty good.<br />The highlights of this book, though, are the wonderful ideas that it contains.  Throughout the entire series, I can't remember Time ever being used as a weapon like it is in this book.  The idea of intentionally accelerating and decelerating time is great.  This also provides some nice imagery, as the Doctor and friends journey through parts of this world in vehicles that are insulated from the effects.  They stumble upon a decelerated scene where a man is in the process of being shot, and it's chilling.  Then there is the idea of getting part of a body into one of these fields.  It can really make you shiver.<br />Then there are the creatures that end up invading the base.  They can do so many things with time that it seems they are impossible to stop.  Some of the things they can do defy logic, but they are so interesting that you don't mind.  This forces the Doctor to come up with new and creative ways of dealing with them, which just adds to the sense of impending danger.  While the characters aren't very interesting, the fact that there's so few of them does add to the menace as the station is attacked.<br />One neat aspect of the book, at least for long-time Who fans, is that this is basically a base-under-siege story.  Early in the TV series, there was almost an entire season where the Doctor and companions arrive at some sort of base just as it's about to be attacked.  It became a bit of a clich&eacute;.  Fortunately, Morris puts enough of a spin on it that you don't really notice it.  He also adds to it, as they then leave the base to prevent an even greater catastrophe.<br />Ultimately, this book is a satisfying read.  While good characters are missed, the plot more than makes up for it.  The beginning has a marvelously creepy feeling, and the tense atmosphere continues to a very surprising conclusion.  It's definitely a must read for fans of the series, and it's still a pretty decent read for non-fans.e attacked.  It became a bit of a cliché.

While good characters are missed, the plot more than makes up for it.  The beginning has a marvelously creepy feeling, and the tense atmosphere continues to a very surprising conclusion.  It's definitely a must read for fans of the series, and it's still a pretty decent read for non-fans.	2002-07-07

He shows that he has a wonderful handle on the main characters of the series (the Doctor and his companions), but he doesn't bring us anybody interesting to have them deal with, with the exception of Silver.  It says something when there are very few characters in a book, and yet you still can't really tell them apart except by remembering their names and their job descriptions.<br />The Doctor and crew arrive on the planet Endpoint after having taxed the TARDIS to its limits.  The city of Hope is a twisted mass of steel situated on a vast, acidic sea.  Upon landing, the TARDIS quickly falls into this sea and sinks to the bottom, leaving our heroes trapped.  Silver, the most powerful man in Hope, offers to retrieve it for the Doctor, for a price.  Thus, begins a whodunnit, and the Doctor must solve a series of murders in order to restore his freedom.  While he does that, one of his companions is doing something else that could make this mystery academic.<br />The plot of this book is divided into two parts, with a fairly boring joining of the two.  The book starts out very well, with an interesting concept and a good introduction to Silver.  You really find yourself wondering what is happening, who is committing these murders.  The idea of Hope is good, and Clapham sets the scene wonderfully.  You can feel the desolation of Hope, a city with a toxic atmosphere resting in a toxic sea on a poisonous planet.<br />However, the book quickly devolves.  Silver, while being a well-rounded character, is described in almost comic book terms, even given an origin story.  I could see the panels of the comic as his past was being described.  A whole chapter is devoted to this (and even given the name \\"Secret Origins!\\") and it brings the book to a grinding halt that it never recovers from.  While he does have an interesting origin, the way this origin is told is simply tedious. It's a shame, too, because Silver is ultimately the most interesting character in the book.<br />The rest of the characters aren't nearly as good.  Clapham only creates three or four other characters, and they're still not memorable.  One of them doesn't seem to have any purpose.  He's only in two brief scenes, and while his first scene hints that he'll be more important to the plot, he ultimately just disappears.  One could say that he's there to represent the typical citizen of Hope, but if so, it's not done very effectively.  Miraso is a bit more interesting, but she's still very one-note.  Powlin is a cliched tired cop.  There are a couple of characters introduced later who are also pretty basic.<br />The Doctor and his companions, however, are extremely well done, and they save the book from being a boring morass.  Anji finally gets a meaty role, as she has to make some decisions that could very well affect the bond that has formed between her and her friends.  Watching her agonize with her decision is very interesting, and Clapham writes her well.  A follower of the Doctor Who series could wonder why it's taken her so long to deal with some of these issues, but that's not a problem in the book itself.  The Doctor is also very good, with his curiosity and drive to help people very prominent.  The only one who suffers a bit is Fitz, as he's not given a lot of any consequence to do, but what is there is good.  He goes off on a brief diversion that ultimately doesn't have much to do with anything but keep him busy.<br />I haven't spoken much about the plot, and there's a reason for that.  There isn't really much of one.  The book is very short for a Who book (249 pages) and yet it still feels padded.  There are 10 pages of Silver's origin, there's Fitz's side plot, and then the rather lengthy link between the two parts of the story.  Silver's origin isn't the only thing that feels like a comic book, as he is introduced in a hail of bullets, with everybody looking on him in awe as he presents himself.  It just didn't work for me.  The initial story is kind of interesting, but the second part of the book sinks into clich&eacute; and becomes very boring.  Anji is the only thing that keeps the reader's interest at all.<br />Ultimately, it's a good thing that the book is fairly short.  Even as short as it is, it still took me awhile to get through it.  Once I got past the really intriguing set up, I was fairly bored.  Thankfully, every time I got near the breaking point, Clapham would do something really neat with one of the regulars, or have some little character scene that was all too rare, and the book would pick up again momentarily.  It was enough to keep me going, and enough to earn it three stars (probably 2.5 if half-stars could be given).

US	50332419	RUZ9A5B94C6L4	0743435338	531654219	Diplomatic Immunity	Books	4	16	16	N	N	Honeymoon in Quaddiespace	Diplomatic Immunity is the latest book in the Miles Vorkosigan science fiction series.  Lois McMaster Bujold has created, in Miles, one of my favourite characters in the genre.  All of the books she's written in this series have been very good, most of them great.  I can't recall a clunker in the bunch.  With Diplomatic Immunity, I'd say she's still on that streak, though it's not as good as the most recent books have been.<br /><br />This is yet another winner, but it somehow felt less consequential then most of the Vorkosigan books.  The previous books have almost been \\"event\\" books in Miles's life, while this one just seemed a bit ordinary.  Sure, there is the birth of their children, but that mainly provides an impetus for Miles and Ekaterin to finish the problem as soon as possible, rather than being an event in itself.  It's nice to see Miles again, but I guess we've been spoiled by the previous books into expecting even more.  Perhaps that's not this book's fault, though.<br /><br />The mystery itself is very intriguing.  Bujold provides lots of twists and turns.  Miles gets to use his vast intelligence to solve the problem and there's a bit of action.  Bujold excels at creating characters, and that's definitely shown here.  We already love Miles and Ekaterin, but the old friend of Miles who shows up is also wonderfully portrayed.  Even the new people (mostly Quaddies) are well done.  You can clearly see the frustration and desperation in the Quaddie security chief, Venn, as events spiral out of his control.  There is not a false character in the bunch.  The only minor annoyance is that there is no reason to make the Barrayaran Admiral a relation to Miles's cousin Ivan.  Nothing is made of it and it just seems a bit too cute.  Of course, if this is your first book of the series, then that won't bother you.<br /><br />She's created a very interesting society in Quaddiespace.  Quaddies live in a mostly zero gravity environment, which gives them more mobility with their four arms.  If they are in a gravity area, they are in anti-gravity floaters in order to move around.  The society and the politics of the area are very well done.  The political machinations are interesting and the reader watches the situation escalate and wonders how things are going to turn out.  Throughout this series, Bujold has done a wonderful job building this entire area of space, making each society believable, and she's done well again.<br /><br />There isn't as much humour in this book as in the past books.  It doesn't even compare to A Civil Campaign, which was a comedy.  However, it's also missing some of the gentle humour that was in the series before.  It's not a dark book by any means, it's actually fairly light.  But you won't find yourself smiling much as you read this one.  It also drags a bit toward the end, and in a 307 page book, that's not necessarily a good thing.<br /><br />Still, it's nice to see another Miles adventure.  I certainly did enjoy the book, and I can't wait for the next one.  I guess I just expect a bit more from Bujold, and she didn't quite deliver.  I think it's a very good book, just not a great book.  However, it is a great jumping on point if you want to \\"test the waters\\" of the Vorkosigan universe.  It's completely self-contained and any backstory you need is thoroughly explained.  There may be a few references that make you stop and wonder, but most of those aren't necessary for understanding the plot.  If you enjoy this one, then take heart in the fact that it's not the best, so you'll have even better books to read when you start reading the series from the beginning.  And I know you will.

I think I'm beginning to like this Ekaterin.  And I haven't even finished being properly introduced to her yet.  `I'd like you to meet...she's getting away!' seemed a little...truncated.\\"  Cordelia Vorkosigan<br />This book has everything you could want.  It has romantic tangles, political intrigue, a little bit of action, and some of the most wonderful characters that I've ever read about.  Anybody who's been following my reviews knows that I think Miles is one of the best characters in science fiction today.  He approaches most things in a military point of view, including his love life.  He hatches tactical plans, strategic withdrawals and schemes in order to win Ekaterin.  Unfortunately for him, these tend to blow up in your face when they're applied to the dating game.  The plan culminates in a dinner party of huge comedic proportions.  First, Mark's business plan ends up interfering in it, then a misplaced word here and there creates chaos.  I was literally laughing out loud for four straight pages.<br />The other plots are winners too.  Bujold effortlessly weaves her tale among five narrators.  This is the first time she's done that, as she usually just uses one.  It's nice to get other people's viewpoints finally, especially the outsider's view of Miles.  This is the first book where we've seen Ivan's point of view, and it's a classic.  In previous books, we've only seen Miles and his exasperation at Ivan's antics.  This time, we see it from the inside, and his view of Miles is just great.  Ivan's always getting trapped in Miles' schemes, and it's great fun watching him try to avoid it, only to get trapped in his own.<br />The best character in the book, though, is Cordelia.  Miles' mother has always been wonderful (so wonderful that Bujold went back and told the story of how she and Aral Vorkosigan met and fell in love).  She is smart, sarcastic, always able to hit the problem on the head.  She looks on knowingly, but she never butts in until she's either asked, or she realizes she has to. Personally, I think she's the best character Bujold has created, and I always want to see more of her.<br />Don't worry if you're turned off by mushy romance dialogue and situations.  Bujold handles them all so they don't become sickeningly sweet or cloying.  Believe me, I don't really care for romances that much, but I would read anything on the subject by Bujold.  She has a way of making it palatable.  Instead, you get to revel in the fun of watching these events unfold, watching all of the mistakes get made, and wondering if the situations are going to turn out for the best.  She's not afraid to take her characters in different directions, unlike most series writers.  I won't say whether or not things turn out all right in the end, but the good thing about Bujold is that you don't know.<br />This is definitely not a book you want to start with in the Vorkosigan series, though.  While it is perfectly understandable without reading anything else, you will miss out on a lot.  At the very least, read the previous book, Komarr.  That book is where Miles first meets Ekaterin.  If you do read this book first and get entranced with the characters, read the rest of the series and then read this one again.  But, that being said, this is definitely a book you want to read if you like to be entertained.able to hit the problem on the head.

They meet up with White Shadow, a US Special Forces group that is in the area looking for a downed experimental aircraft.  There's also a survivalist cult which is under observation by the military.  Meanwhile, personal problems and strange disappearances affect some of the residents of Melvin, problems which result in these residents getting caught up in the saga of the downed jet.  There's something out there in the snow, something that kills.  Something that not even the Doctor understands.  The Doctor must not only deal with this alien menace, but also some menaces that are all too human.<br />The main character of this novel, you could say, is the weather.  A blanket of white coats this entire book (and not just the cover!).  The atmosphere in this book is almost chilling as everybody is out wallowing in the snow, trying to get to where they need to be.  The snow is almost a living creature in this book, and Forward almost makes you feel cold with his descriptions of what's going on.  It's been a long time since I've had a scene in a book set as vividly as it is here.  Sometimes, you get an image of a town that's in one of those sno-globes, which you pick up and shake.  Other times, the atmosphere is menacing.  It's always perfectly placed, though.<br />The characters aren't as well drawn, however.  Most of the Special Forces soldiers have a personality quirk or something to identify them, but otherwise they're pretty faceless.  The only ones who don't have this problem are Morgan Shaw (the captain), Kristal (the Native American guide), and Joanna (the medic). The rest are indistinguishable.  The same can be said for the townspeople, other than the sheriff (Makenzie Shaw) and Amber, the daughter of Makenzie's girlfriend.  They have a personality conflict which ends up with Amber getting intimately involved with the ongoing menace.  But their story itself is rather dull. Other characters (both soldiers and townspeople) seem to be around just to be killed off.<br />This lack of character extends to Leela as well.  Leela comes from a primitive society, and she is always learning from the Doctor's tutelage.  When Forward concentrates on this, Leela shines almost as much as she does when her creator (Chris Boucher created the character on television) writes her.  However, there isn't that much of this, as Leela is quickly separated from the Doctor and she's on her own.  The rest of what happens to her is fine in a character sense, but she just doesn't get anything to do.  She follows Kristal around for awhile and senses a kindred spirit, but that's it.  She's sidelined to a great extent.<br />There are also two characters that, while I found them interesting, I found them unnecessary.  They are two NSA agents who are harbouring a secret of their own.  The mystery is fairly effective, but once it's revealed, not much is done with it.  It becomes just a background trait, and it lost a lot of its interest when that happened.  They didn't really need to be in the book, and I thought they detracted from the rest of the story.  As characters themselves, however, they were quite good.  Too bad they weren't in another book that was about them.<br />The Doctor is relatively well done, as Forward captures Tom Baker's manic energy that he brought to the television role.  He's bouncing back and forth between situations, making foreboding comments to the locals and generally doing his best to solve the problem.  He's fine, if rather stiff.  And if I heard one more character (or even the narrator!) call himDoc, I was going to scream.<br />The situation that Forward presents, however, is very interesting.  I like the idea of a weather-based foe for once.  Usually, when you think \\"elemental,\\" you think of water or fire, so this was a nice change of pace.  The method of attack the creature has was pretty neat. I could have done without the zombies, though.  The editor of the Who books seems to have a thing for zombies.  I wish I knew why.<br />All in all, this is a pretty decent book, especially for a first novel.  It's way above a 3-star book, but not quite a 4.  Since I have to choose one, though, I'll choose 4.  My advice is to revel in the atmosphere and not worry about the characters so much.  You'll like it a lot better.Doc, I was going to scream.<br />The situation that Forward presents, however, is very interesting.  I like the idea of a weather-based foe for once.

All in all, though, it's a very interesting story.<br />The Seventh Doctor and Ace stop in 2012 to pick up the Doctor's mail.  There are a couple of interesting pieces, though, and it sends them back in time to Scotland in 1982 to help an old friend.  Unfortunately, that old friend is missing, and the search leads to Greystairs, an Alzheimer's clinic.  There, some of the patients seem to be responding very well to treatments to restore their memories.  However, some memories can be dangerous, not only to the patients, but to others.<br />In the course of the story, many questions are asked.  Why is the Doctor being so secretive about his actions before they arrive in Scotland?  What are the strange disappearances that have taken place locally?  Who is stalking them as they explore the area?  Just what is Michael's secret, and why won't he talk to Ace?  What does he have against the Doctor?<br />The book comes complete with weird time-travel activities, a manipulative Seventh Doctor (which is his usual characterization, for those who don't follow the series) and Ace, who is a tough young woman, slightly out of her element, but determined to do the best she can in the situation.  I've always found this team to be an interesting one, even more so in the books than in the TV series.  Ace doesn't quite fit the typical \\"companion\\" role in the Doctor Who series:  she's often more of a partner than most of them are.  She doesn't scream, for instance.  She's a \\"take-action\\" kind of girl.  She's well-served in this book, taking on a large portion of the action.  It's a good thing that Michalowski writes her so well.<br />The other characters aren't served quite as well, though.  The minor characters are fairly forgettable, especially the patients at the clinic.  I found it hard to tell them apart sometimes, and when the ultimate revelation about what's going on happens, I still couldn't tell the difference.  Claire, the barmaid, is a little better, but she's also fairly one-note.  There's an attraction between her and Michael, but it's only mentioned in passing and nothing is ever made of it.<br />In fact, that sort of thing is one of the problems with the book.  Too much is mentioned and then never developed.  There's a murder at Greystairs that the Doctor discovers, but it's never mentioned again.  Sure, the murderer gets his/her comeuppance, but only because of what happens in the plot.  It has nothing to do with bringing the murderer to justice.  It just sort of hangs there and is never mentioned again.<br />Then there's a conflict between Ace and the Doctor that grows out of nowhere.  The reason for it, though stated at the time the problem happens, has no preamble whatsoever and I was actually surprised that all of a sudden, these two characters are fighting.  Why?  Supposedly, the Doctor has broken a promise that we've never seen him make, so it comes completely out of left field.<br />The final thing I want to address about character is Michael, and his motivation.  He goes through most of the book hiding his real reason for being in the area, and hiding why he's so antagonistic toward the Doctor.  When he ultimately reveals it, I was left with a skeptical feeling.  I just didn't believe it.  I won't reveal what the problem is here, but I will say that I can see no way that events would happen as he says they did.  It's just not logical.  People don't act the way he describes them.  To me, it brought his whole characterization to a crashing halt.<br />The story itself is fascinating, though.  There are a lot of twists and turns, and the ending is a mad dash to the finish line with a wonderfully Doctorish solution to the problem.  The only problem is that it's a little too packed.  While the book plodsa little bit in the middle, the end is so full that the reader doesn't have time to take a breath.  There's revelation after revelation hitting the reader in the face.  The author has said that he cut a huge amount from his manuscript to fit the required word count, and it shows.  The time travel antics were interesting (I won't say who's involved in them, because the revelation of that is actually part of the fun of the book) and I didn't find them confusing at all.<br />This past Doctor adventure is definitely worth picking up, especially if you're a fan of the Seventh Doctor/Ace partnership.  With the exception of the conflict at the end, they are characterized beautifully.  It's also a good book to introduce a non-Who fan to.  It's well-written, and most of all it's fun.a little bit in the middle, the end is so full that the reader doesn't have time to take a breath.

One of these problems is a typical result of being a Star Trek book, and the other one isn't.  First, the book literally wallows in Star Trek continuity.  It is possible to understand and enjoy the story without knowing everything there is to know about Star Trek history, which is a good thing.  However, if you are familiar with the history, you find yourself constantly rolling your eyes at how much the authors try to tie together.  Let's see:  you have the marriage of Spock and Saavik (who was introduced in the Star Trek II movie), you have the Romulan Commander from the Original Series episode \\"The Enterprise Incident,\\" you have a young Jean-Luc Picard from the Next Generation series (for no apparent reason other than \\"proving\\" his televised statement that he was \\"at the ambassador's son's wedding), you have the Enterprise C and it's battle with the Romulans at Narendra III (from the Next Generation episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\") which also brings Tasha Yar (from the Next Generation series) into play as well.  Throw in a couple of bit characters that have appeared in previous Next Generation episodes, too.  I'm surprised that the Trek equivalent of the Kitchen Sink wasn't in there as well.  It's just too much, the book feels overloaded.  Some desperate fans might love to see all of this stuff tied together, but this Trek fan doesn't think that everything in the televised Trek universe should be tied together into a neat little bow.<br />That fault is really only noticeable to the Trek fan, and may slip under the radar if you don't know about it, though you may get an impression that something's wrong.  The second fault, however, is universal:  the writing is horrible.  I don't know what happened to Sherman & Schwartz, because Vulcan's Forge (their first Trek book) was fabulous.  Maybe I was a different reader at the time and didn't notice the prose, but I remember loving it.  This one, however, is atrocious.  First, there is the overuse of exclamation marks.  It's bad enough to have characters often end their statements with exclamation marks (which these characters do), but the narrative also does.  Often.  Sorry, ladies, but the story isn't that exciting.  You can't thrill me any more by trying to artificially pump it up.<br />Secondly, there is the constant repetition.  Spock and Saavik are constantly thinking about how they have to fight off what's affecting them in order to continue their mission.  Constantly.  All the time.  Every other paragraph.  Get the picture?  Sherman & Schwartz are always reminding us of what their characters are going through, even when they just did at the top of the previous page.  Some may find this adds to the tension.  Will Spock succumb to his ills?  Will Saavik jump off the balcony rather than give in?  After the third or fourth time, I didn't care.  I wished they would, actually.  To me, this doesn't add to the tension, it adds to the tedium.<br />As mentioned before, Picard serves no real purpose.  He could have been any other Starfleet captain.  The only reason he's there is because it would be neat, I think.  Even his characterization is such that he could be any other captain.  In fact, the characterization of almost everybody is off a bit.  Spock and Saavik have a bit of an excuse, given what they're going through.  But most of the rest of the characters don't.  Uhura, while being the competent officer we all know, hasn't aged very well.  The Romulans that are introduced are fairly one-note, though there are a couple of exceptions.  The Praetor is your typical insane \\"villain that must be stopped.\\"<br />The exceptions are what bring this novel up to a 2-star book.  While I didn't like the fact that they were in the book, the crew of the Enterprise C was wonderfully done.  It made me really wish they would do a TV series about this ship.  Rachel Garrett is a great captain, and it's completely understandable that the crew follows her into this situation.  The foreboding atmosphere is wonderfully done, with the crew preparing for what they feel is a suicide mission.  They do it without complaint, knowing that they're going in to save lives.  Very satisfying.<br />The second exception is Ambassador Sarek, Spock's father.  Sherman & Schwartz capture perfectly the subtleties that hide within Sarek.  He's the perfect example of the \\"Vulcans do have emotions, they just hide them\\" philosophy.  He allows himself a small smile in private.  He can be slightly sarcastic or even make a small joke.  He's serene and calm, no matter what is going on.  He's wonderfully compassionate.  The love he has for his son and his new daughter-in-law is very apparent, and he almost loses control even in public.  But he's able to right himself.  I've always liked Sarek, and the authors do a great job with him.<br />However, it is not enough to save the book.  It's tedious, forcing the reader to slog through the writing to get to the good parts, of which there aren't enough.  If you must read this book, then check it out from the library.  If you read and enjoyed Vulcan's Forge, you don't have to read this one.  First of all, it's not much of a continuation (it continues the character of one of the Romulans from that book).

US	50332419	RWD6H9XPN7X7M	0380818191	476581890	The Truth (Discworld)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Pressing business in Ankh-Morpork	The Truth has the honour of being the 25th Discworld book.  I haven't read all 25, but I have read a fair number of them, and I'd have to say this one is the best in awhile, even better than The Fifth Elephant.<br />William de Worde, outcast son of a local rich family in Ankh Morpork, has been regularly supplying (via engraving) a news page to a few select people in the city and the surrounding areas.  One day, he is literally run over by the power of the press, in this case allowed to run amok by a group of dwarves.  After regaining consciousness, William sees what this press can do and the possibilities it represents to get the news out to people. Imagine, movable type!  Thus begins the saga of the Ankh-Morpork Times.  William enlists the dwarves, and hires a young lady, Sacharissa Cripslock, to be a reporter.  She's got a nose for headlines and is able to use some feminine wiles to get sources to talk to her.  He also hires Otto Chriek, a vampire, as a photographer.  Poor Otto has a fascination with flash photography, but every time the flash goes off, he becomes a pile of ash and needs help reforming himself.<br />When Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of the city, is accused of attempted murder, the City Watch is on the case, followed closely by William. Sometimes, too closely, as Commander Vimes has to deal with not only the crime, but also this new person breathing down his neck and asking questions.  William thinks the public has a right to know what is going on.  As the investigation continues, things get hotter and hotter for William, as he finds out that the search for the Truth isn't always a safe one.<br />There are so many things that make this book stand out.  The first is the character of William.  He's a crusader, a second son of a rich family.  In Ankh-Morpork, only first sons ever really do anything. Subsequent sons are expected to go to school, graduate, and stay out of the way.  William doesn't do that, but instead wants to make a name for himself.  He hardly ever lies and has a deep respect for the truth, which is why he's so dedicated in this book.  He's a wonderful straight man, reacting to some of the absurd events that are surrounding him as if they're not absurd.<br />Probably the best character, though, is Otto.  He is so earnest in his profession, but he also has the funniest lines and situations.  You would think that the repetition of \\"Flash!  Arrrrrrrrrrrrgh!\\" would get boring after awhile, but it doesn't. The situations that it happens in are so varied that it never gets old.  He's a very dedicated photographer, innovative (he is able to invent colour photography) and very loyal to William.  He's also \\"on the wagon,\\" which means that he doesn't drink human blood anymore.  One of the funniest scenes in the book is when he's tempted (completely innocently and in a stressful situation) by Sacharissa.<br />One of the more interesting aspects of this book, at least for long-time Discworld readers, is the City Watch.  This is the first book (or at least the first I've read) where the Watch is featured very heavily, but it's not *about* the Watch.  There are only two or three scenes that are from the viewpoint of somebody who's in the Watch.  Thus, you get to see them as outsiders see them.  You see the strangeness that can happen without seeing the inherent reasoning behind it, and that is refreshing.  Vimes is the same as he always has been, but his reactions to William and this new idea of somebody actually trying to tell people what is truly going on are simply hilarious.  He doesn't like it and he doesn't react well to it.<br />The book mirrors the rise of newspapers very well, even down to the creation of tabloids (Mayor Stolen by Aliens!).  Of course, the whole thing is condensed into a few weeks (and one investigative story), but it's still a nice parallel.  Pratchett goes all out, showing not only the virtues of a free press, but also some of the faults.  Most importantly, though, it shows the various reactions to this new medium:  some fear it, some welcome it, some will take advantage of it (like the guy with the funny vegetables who wants them in the paper every day).  Just like real life, only funnier.<br />This book is definitely worth a read.  It doesn't matter if this is your first Discworld book or your 25th, you'll love it.various reactions to this new medium:  some fear it, some welcome it, some will take advantage of it (like the guy with the funny vegetables who wants them in the paper every day).

US	50332419	R1AX5VXW1H4G1K	0671042386	905703132	Requiem (Star Trek New Frontier: Excalibur, Book 9)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	New frontier on the New Frontier	The \\"New Frontier\\" series of Star Trek books is generally a step above the other Star Trek books, mainly because it focuses on mostly original characters (and the characters that aren't original were only seen in an episode or two of the Next Generation series).  Thus, Peter David can do anything he wants to do with them, as long as the universe itself doesn't change (thus, he can't destroy the Federation or anything).  This is a definite plus in a line of books where the stories can start to sound the same.  The fact that Peter David created and is writing all of the books in the series is even more of a plus.  I have always loved his writing, whether it's his comics or his books.<br />Number 9 in the series, \\"Requiem,\\" is a good example of this quality.  It's the first book of a 3-book miniseries within the New Frontier line.  The Excalibur has been destroyed, and its crew is back on Earth learning to deal with it.  They have lost their captain in that explosion, the captain that held these disparate personalities together as a unit, sometimes by sheer force of personality.  The crew is going through the \\"cooling-off\\" period that crews must go through when their ships are destroyed.  The beginning of the book consists of a meeting between the entire crew at a bar, where they drown their sorrows a little bit.  Then, the book branches off to follow three of the crew members:  Soleta, the half-Vulcan, half-Romulan science officer; Si Cwan, the Thallonian ambassador that had been traveling aboard the Excalibur assisting it in its mission; and Kebron & McHenry, the security officer and helm officer respectively.<br />Soleta's story consists of her going to find the man who raped her mother, thus resulting in Soleta's birth.  This quest brings her new realizations about herself, especially her half-breed legacy.  Si Cwan and his sister have to find the killer of Si Cwan's former instructor, after his sister dreams of his death.  The dream turns out to be a perfect image of the truth.  Finally, Kebron and McHenry go to a backward planet (where nobody has ever heard of space travel) to discover why some people are apparently being abducted by aliens.<br />David switches between these plots effortlessly, usually ending the chapter on a cliffhanger, unless the next chapter is also about the same character.  Soleta's plot is the most interesting, as her voyage is almost one of self-discovery.  She tracks down her biological father, ready to hate him, but she finds herself coming to respect him.  He's apparently reformed, and he's dying.  The relationship grows and lives with David's writing of it.  There are plenty of surprises in store, though, so don't think you'll be able to predict how it ends.<br />The other two plots aren't quite as interesting.  I've never really cared for the Si Cwan character, so his subplot, at least for me, was just marking time until we could get back to Soleta.  There were a couple of funny moments in there, but overall, it just dragged the rest of the story down.  I don't really remember his sister (it's been awhile since I've read the previous book), but she didn't really do much for me in this book.  She has some sort of prescient dream ability that she has no control over, but otherwise she's a bit of a cipher.  Overall, when David came to this plot, I wished he'd go back to one of the others.  Unfortunately, this story is the only one that doesn't come to completion, which means we're going to get more of it soon.<br />The alien abduction storyline wasn't much better, and had a resolution that just made me groan (and not in pleasure).  It has to be seen to be believed.  However, it was saved by the humor.  Kebron is a very droll character, and he's very set in his ways.  He's also very direct.  He won't pull any punches in what he says.  The reactions of other characters to this is just priceless.  McHenry's character is not quite as interesting, but his interaction with Kebron is very good.  It's toobad that the plot ended this way, because otherwise it would have been the standout of the book.<br />As it is, though, Soleta's story is the only one that holds together until the end.  Overall, the book is very good, though.  David's writing and humor save the book where it starts to drag.  Only a couple of \\"now wait just a minute\\" moments detract from it.  Otherwise, it'd be a 5 star book.bad that the plot ended this way, because otherwise it would have been the standout of the book.<br />As it is, though, Soleta's story is the only one that holds together until the end.

US	50332419	R1CBGTDQMFGFJ6	0743412257	222353890	In the Name of Honor (Star Trek)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Klingons and more Klingons!	I've been out of the Star Trek novel business for awhile. I used to buy them religiously, but they just never seemed to be worth the money to me. I was at the library recently, though, and there were a bunch of more recent Star Trek books there, so I checked them out.<br /><br /> The first book I looked at was In the Name of Honor, by Dayton Ward. The first thing that struck me was the dynamic cover. The Klingon war ship swooping over the canyon, firing away, was just beautiful. The insides were pretty good, too. I think you should probably be a Star Trek fan, or at least follow the series a bit, before you pick this up. The book just wallows in continuity.<br /><br /> The basic plot is that there is a peace conference going on between the Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. They have been hostile toward each other since before the time of the original Trek series. About six years ago, a Federation ship was attacked by a Klingon cruiser. Prisoners were taken, but it was done secretly. Only a few high-ranking people knew about them. The Federation thought the ship was destroyed with no survivors. Now, with the peace talks happening, word has reached other Klingons that these prisoners exist. The Empire is undergoing some radical philosophical changes (in series terms, they're moving from the evil-doers of the Original Series to the honourbound Klingons of the Next Generation TV series), and the taking of these prisoners and holding them secretly is not honourable. The original higher-ups would make the problem go away if it was ever discovered.<br /><br /> Koloth, one of Kirk's Klingon enemies from the episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles,&quot; brings this information to Captain Kirk, at the request of Councilor Gorkon. He wants a full disclosure to the Federation, but realizes that the original conspirators would have the prisoners killed if it was brought up. So Koloth brings the information to Kirk and they hatch a plan to launch a daring rescue of the prisoners. Meanwhile, opponents of the peace talks (including these conspirators) are trying to disrupt the conference. Kirk and Sulu go on the rescue mission while Spock and the rest of the crew deal with the crisis at the peace talks.<br /><br /> This book takes place between the movies Star Trek V and Star Trek VI. If you follow the Star Trek mythos, then this is important because it helps you place the personalities of some of the characters, as well as some of the events. Gorkon is the Klingon Chancellor in Star Trek VI, but he's a relatively new councilor in this book, for example. The book tries very hard to set everything up for the beginning of the sixth movie. For awhile, I was wondering how he was going to do that in Kirk's instance, because Kirk seemed to be learning to tolerate Klingons, and at the beginning of the sixth movie, he was virulently anti-Klingon. However, Ward does do a good job of setting that up so it makes sense. Circumstances occur that make it logical.<br /><br /> As I said earlier, though, the book just oozes continuity. I counted references to at least 10 original series episodes (Koloth and another Klingon are from one episode, and Commander Garrovick is from another episode). Unfortunately, the book grinds to a halt every time Ward has to give a short plot summary of that episode. It's especially annoying when you already remember the episode and get the reference without the explanation. Many of these references are just off-hand remarks, which makes them even more avoidable. I'm not even going to get into Ward's hinted explanation for the differences in appearance between the Original Series Klingons and the Movie/Next Generation Klingons (i.e. the ridged foreheads), because I'd never be able to do it justice in this limited space. Let's just say that the hinting was a bit too cute for my taste. Unfortunately, given the story, it was unavoidable. It would have been nice, at the very least, to not have to deal with why Koloth changed in appearance from an Original Series Klingon to a Movie Klingon.<br /><br /> The book does have its good points, though. It's well written for a first book (Ward has been previously published in the three fan anthologies published by Pocket Books). It's not standout writing, but it's certainly readable and not annoying. The story is interesting and the regular characters are well done. There are no glaring characterization problems, which can sometimes be a hazard with TV tie-in fiction. I definitely enjoyed my time reading it, but then I'm a Trekkie at heart. If you don't follow the series, however, I can't see that much in this story that would make you want to change that.al Series Klingon to a Movie Klingon.

US	50332419	R1GW9ALUARSKND	0061020400	847958713	The Fifth Elephant (Discworld)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Political Disc	The Fifth Elephant is the latest Discworld book that features the City Watch of Ankh-Morpork, a city on the Disc.  The City Watch books have always been my favourite Discworld books, mainly because of the characters.  There's the wonderful character of Vimes, who is head of the Watch.  He's cynical but fair-minded, always thinking the worst of things, but doing his best to make the city the best it can be.  Then there's Captain Carrot, a human who was raised by dwarfs and considers himself one.  Even the incidental characters have wonderful moments.  This fifth book in the series is probably the best since the original, \\"Guards, Guards.\\"  It was wonderfully funny with lots of good character bits.<br /> In this book, Commander Vimes (a recent addition to the nobility of the city) is sent to attend the coronation of the new Dwarf \\"King.\\"  Vimes is new to all of this \\"politics\\" stuff, as he generally sees himself as a cop first, and a good one.  He feels out of his element in this new political arena.  Of course, that's why the head of the city, Patrician Vetinari, has sent him on this mission.  In going to this coronation, Vimes stumbles upon a plot between a family of werewolves and some of the dwarfs who don't quite like the way society is being liberalized (i.e. dwarfs actually showing that they're female by wearing dresses and jewelry, dwarfs going to the city of Ankh-Morpork to find better lives, etc).  They plan to disrupt the coronation, and Vimes finds himself having to stop them.<br />There are two sub plots in the book, one related, and one seeming to be there just to give some characters something to do.  The first one involves Carrot and his girl-wolf, Angua.  Angua was supposed to go on this mission with Vimes, but she has disappeared.  Carrot enlists the aid of the talking dog, Gaspode, to track her.  This plot does end up meeting with the main plot, which is a good thing.  Carrot is well portrayed, a combination of innocence, grim determination and genuine (if innocent) caring for Angua.  You can see in his actions what he thinks of her, even though he generally can't bring himself to say anything.  It's a fairly interesting subplot, especially when it ends up dovetailing with the Vimes plot.<br />The same can't be said for the second subplot, though.  It's clearly there just to give some of the other characters a chore.  Sgt. Colon, one of the founding members of the Watch (but by no means the most intelligent), finds himself left in charge with Vimes and Carrot gone.  This authority, along with a looming paranoia, start to degrade the Watch.  He starts watching everybody with a growing intensity, alienating everybody.  This plot has its funny moments and involves some of the other Watch characters (Shoe, the zombie; Visit, the religious fanatic; Nobby, the weird one).  However, it can't help but feel like filler.  I don't know whether it was intended to add to the page count or if it was supposed to give the other characters something to do.  Either way, it feels wasted and tacked on.<br />Despite that, the book is a great addition to the mythos.  It's hilarious, with wonderful character moments (a vampire on AA?) and a great plot.  Unlike the previous books, there doesn't appear to be an overall message to the book (Jingo was anti-war, for example), but it doesn't suffer from that.  Sometimes, you just have to tell a good story, and this one does.  Watching Vimes try to adjust to his new life and mission is worth the price of admission alone.  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Detritus, the main troll in the Watch.  He is the best character in the series, no matter how much or little he is in it.  He doesn't have a very large part in The Fifth Elephant, but he lights up the scene whenever he's in there.<br />This is a great book.  It also stands alone pretty well.

I haven't read the series that this one is a sequel to (the Farseer Trilogy), but I have read the Liveship Trader trilogy, which takes place in a different part of the same world.  I thought that series was outstanding, and was determined to read this one as soon as I could get my hands on it.<br />Was it worth it?  Definitely.  Hobb has a grasp of character that is simply marvelous to read, and the action usually isn't too bad either.  One of the wonderful things about this book is that, while it is part of a series, the book is self-contained.  There are plot threads that I'm sure will lead into the next book, but it doesn't end on a cliffhanger.  It's kind of like Terry Brooks' Shannara series used to be before he decided to go down the cliffhanger route.  The world as created by Hobb is well-crafted, the magic system is easy to understand.  Magic is not all-powerful, and its use has consequences.<br />Fitzchivalry Farseer has retired from his life as an assassin for the royal house.  Evidently, in the first series, he was apparently killed, and he's happy to leave most people with that misconception.  He's retired to the country to live with his wolf and bond-mate, Nighteyes, and with his foster son, Hap.  He's adopted the name Tom Badgerlock.  After fifteen years of this, he's reasonably happy with the way his life is going.  After a personal shake-up in his life, and a visit from his old mentor, Chade, he finds himself lacking something, though.  He's then called to the royal house for an important mission:  the prince has disappeared, and Fitz must find him.  Throughout the story, he must balance his desire for solitude with his loyalty to the Farseers.<br />The characters in this book are outstanding.  All of the main characters are three dimensional, they all have faults (there is no perfect hero).  Fitz has his doubts about his ability, about the use of his magic, about his foster son.  He's 15 years older than he was when he was an assassin, and you can tell.  His wolf is also older.  Age and the effects of aging actually play a significant role in the book.  Chade is also getting older, and he's not quite as capable of some things as he used to be. He's still extremely crafty, though, and he uses that.  The prince is also a very interesting character:  he's young, impetuous, moody at times (especially with what happens to him in the book).  He's not stereotypical at all.<br />The best character in the book, though, is the Fool.  I understand he plays a prominent role in the previous series as well, and his friendship with Fitz is very well-portrayed.  They have a love that is beyond friendship, beyond family, a bond that ties them very closely together.  He provides a lot of comic relief, but he's also very intelligent.  He plays the arrogant noble very well, but it's obvious to the reader that this is a role for him.<br />The only thing wrong with this book, and it does knock a star off of my rating, is the incredible slowness of the beginning.  It starts off very leisurely, taking its time to get where it wants to go.  Some events happen to Fitz in this section, but it's mostly illustrating what his life is like now, what he gave up to live like this, his conflict within himself about his magical ability.  Then the Fool shows up, and Hobb spends a large number of pages detailing what Fitz did in the 15 years since they had last met.  A lot of this sounds almost like a droning lecturer telling a personal history.  It got a bit tedious.  This section was only saved by my love for the characters and their portrayal.  I wanted to know what happened next.  This was my introduction to these characters, so I enjoyed that aspect of it.  But by page 75, I was really wishing Hobb would get on with things.<br />I reviewed another book that I couldn't finish, mainly because of the tediousness of the first half.  This book could easily have fallen into that trap too, and very nearly did.  But I carried on with it, knowing that something good would be coming.  Plus, I liked these characters, while the characters in the other book did nothing for me.  Thus, I had a bit of a hook left in me in this book that I didn't have in the other one.  Once it got going, though, the book is outstanding.<br />This is definitely a keeper.  Just keep slogging through the beginning.  It's worth it in the end.nto that trap too, and very nearly did.

I've been dying to read American Gods since I saw an interview with Neil Gaiman in the local paper.

Last week, I finally did.<br />Was it worth the wait?  You betcha.  This is a truly marvelous book dealing with compassion, loyalty, relationships, deities, and how one man is affected by it all.  This man is Shadow, a man who is in prison for assault.  He is ready to be released and get back to his life when he gets word that his wife has died.  He later finds out that the job he has waiting for him when he gets out is no longer there as well.  Shadow is approached by a mysterious figure, Mr. Wednesday, who knows a lot about him.  Wednesday offers Shadow a job as a driver who may have to do other \\"dangerous\\" things as well.<br />Thus begins a long journey that will span the entirety of Midwestern American.  At times, American Gods feels like a travelogue, at other times, like a road movie.  Then, there are quieter times where it is a mystery of sorts.  Some people may have trouble with the conflicting \\"styles,\\" but all of these sequences fall under the overarching theme of the novel.  As Gaiman mentions in his acknowledgements, he is attempting to \\"find America,\\" and the representation in this novel is stunning.  You really get the feel for small, middle America town living, where every town is the \\"home of\\" a semi-famous athlete or a state champion in some sport.<br />The basic concept of the book is that immigrants to the United States (or North America in general, considering one of the interludes deals with immigrants from a few thousand years ago) bring their gods with them in their minds.  Unfortunately for them, belief in them has been faltering for many years, and it's almost gone.  It's been replaced by other gods:  technology, media, Internet.  Wednesday wants to fight back by gathering together the older gods and starting a war with the new ones.  He brings Shadow along for a lot of these recruiting missions, and thus we meet some of the older gods.<br />The characters in American Gods are just wonderfully portrayed.  Even the minor characters are well-rounded and three dimensional.  My favourites have to be Ibis and Jacquel, two characters that Shadow meets in Cairo, Illinois.  They're undertakers, but they offer him a unique perspective on this whole thing.  Then there are some Native American gods who are also quite interesting.<br />Curiously enough, the most under-developed character throughout the book is Shadow himself.  You don't find out a lot about him until the end of the book.  You get snippets of information, but most of things you find out about him are through his actions in the book.  You see a compassion that's hidden beneath the tough exterior.  You see a loyalty to his friends, a sense of honour that even death can't destroy.  I find him the most interesting character in the book, which is good because he's the central character.<br />For me, there really isn't a flaw in this book.  I've seen reviews that complain about the interludes or the sequence of events in Lakeside (a small town in Wisconsin), and how they don't \\"have much to do with the plot of the book.\\"  I think that's missing the point.  The book is more than the war of the gods.  It's about finding values.  It's about moving beyond beliefs.  It's about one man and how he reacts to these things.  I think the Lakeside sequence is actually the core of the book to some extent.  The ending of the war is a bit anti-climactic, but I didn't mind that for the same reasons.<br />If you have any interest in mythology, run out and get this book.

US	50332419	RUYJ0WTY3380U	0061092177	497629870	Small Gods	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Religious Disc	\\"Small Gods\\" is a book set in the Discworld universe.  It is a stand-alone book and not part of any other series (i.e. the City Watch, Death, Wyrd Sisters).  It's also a very good book, though it's nowhere near my favourite.  The back cover calls it a great comedy, but I didn't find it all that funny.  It was good, makes very insightful comments on religion and how it is set up.  There are some great moments in the book as well.  Most of these consist of indirect comments on our world that just pop up and hit you in the face with their accuracy.  But again, it's not that funny.<br />It is set in the land of Omnia, a heavily religious land, or at least it seems to the outside.  They are very intolerant of other religions, going so far as to torture heretics for their beliefs.  In reality, though, there is no real belief there.  It has become a power structure instead of a true religion.  Om, the god that they worship, has come to visit.  Unfortunately, while he intended to come down as something noble (like a swan), he appeared as a tortoise.  To make things worse, he traveled the Disc for three years without realizing he was Om.  This happened because nobody truly believes in him any more, and gods derive their power from belief.<br />There is one person who does believe in him very deeply, though, and that's Brutha.  Because of this, Om has to use him to try and get his followers back.  Brutha is a very simple man; he can't read and write, and he enjoys puttering around in the temple garden.  He's a very unlikely choice for a chosen one.  Unfortunately, he's the only choice Om has.  One thing Brutha does have is a fantastic memory.  He can remember everything he sees, even if he doesn't know what it means.  This ability very often comes in handy, whether it has to do with the library or getting out of a maze.  Om finds that a simple man isn't always the most easily controlled, though.<br />The story is a very interesting comment on religious practices.  It covers everything from organized religion to the creationism/evolution debate.  The people of Omnia don't believe that the world is flat, on the backs of four elephants that are standing on a Great Turtle.  No religion is singled out for ridicule, though, as most of the comments are made about religious structure in general.  The belief that a god's power is based on how many people believe in him is very interesting.  Neil Gaiman uses the same idea in his American Gods book.<br />The characters are all well done.  Brutha is an unlikely prophet, but as events happen to him and he grows into the role (no matter how reluctantly), you believe the transition.  Vorbis, the exquisitor (as opposed to the inquisitor), is suitably sadistic.  He's the one main character that you could say is slightly two dimensional because you don't know why he is what he is.  He's not as devout as he seems, and he does enjoy his work, but that's pretty much all we know.<br />Om is a great character, though.  He's suitably sarcastic.  He uses Brutha for his own ends.  He tries to keep Brutha in the dark about how the belief system works, and why he has appeared to Brutha.  He's arrogant (shown especially when he visits the other gods).  He also has many of the best lines.<br />The main problem with this book, though, is that the comedy just doesn't seem to be there.  Sure, after reading the annotations, some of the bits seem funnier.  Maybe I just wasn't getting the jokes as much.  Some of the exchanges between Brutha and Om are priceless.  The philosophers of Ephebe make their return from Pyramids, and they are hilarious.  I always enjoy them.  But there's not enough of it.  Perhaps this one just went over my head.  One of the things that is really missing is the funny footnotes.  In the previous books I've read, there are footnotes on almost every third or fourth page.  They were great!  However, this one only has a few of them. I would call this book more \\"amusing\\" then \\"funny.\\"<br />Still, the book is well worth reading, and I would suggest you pick it up for the philosophical insights and the writing.  There are some funny moments as well, just not as many.  And if you already like Pratchett, this is certainly a good one to continue with.he book is well worth reading, and I would suggest you pick it up for the philosophical insights and the writing.

US	50332419	R1JZROYXPKH48P	0061059072	199937184	The Last Continent	Books	5	1	1	N	N	G'day Mate!  Discworld goes south	The Last Continent is another Discworld book, a wonderful series of books by Terry Pratchett that takes place on a Disc, on the backs of four elephants that are standing on a cosmic turtle that's hurtling through space.  This one features another adventure of the wizard who's not very good at wizardry, Rincewind.  One thing he's good at, though, is getting into trouble, and boy does he in this one!<br />Rincewind is stranded in a dry, desolate place called XXXX (that's \\"ecks-ecks-ecks-ecks\\" to the locals).  There is no rain.  Instead, there is some water that you have to dig for.  Unfortunately, that's starting to dry up too.  Magic is going crazy on this continent, and Rincewind has been chosen to sort things out.  Of course, as the kangaroo who gives him the job states, Rincewind already has sorted things out, so the kangaroo has no doubt that Rincewind will come around and accept the responsibility of sorting things out.  Make sense?  It doesn't to Rincewind either.  He is forced to go on a journey around the continent (very obviously, it's supposed to be Australia, though supposedly Pratchett denies this) and falls into adventure after adventure.  He's attacked by a drunken wombat, he discovers \\"Ecksians\\" can come up with new phrases (this actually seems to make Australian euphemisms make sense).  He discovers an alternate group of wizards from another Unseen University, and accepts there help in his mission.<br />Speaking of the Unseen University, a number of faculty wizards end up on a desert island after stepping through a window in the study of one of another faculty member.  Unfortunately, that window gets closed, leaving them trapped on this island, ages in the past, with no way to get back home.  What would a normal wizard do in this situation?  Of course!  They panic.  The resolution of all this, and how these two stories tie together, is really worth reading.  I don't want to give away any more than I already have.<br />The Last Continent is a tremendously funny book.  It's not as good as the City Watch books (another series of books taking place on Discworld), but it is well worth the time spent on it.  Pratchett is a master at silly humour, and there's lots of it in this one.  There's the aforementioned bit on euphemisms, there's one of the wizards trying to explain time paradoxes to a group of wizards that just don't get it.  There's a scene taken from the movie The Road Warrior that is just priceless.  The jokes never stop.<br />This book does tend to grow on you as well.  When I first finished it, I rated it as a 4-star book.  I thought it was really good, but not outstanding.  However, after having had some time to reflect, it has really risen in my estimation.  I'm thinking back to all of the funny bits and I find myself almost laughing out loud while remembering.  It's the best of the Rincewind books that I've read (which, admittedly, leaves out any between The Light Fantastic and this one).  This is definitely a 5-star book.<br />The characters are just wonderful.  While Rincewind has his great moments, the other wizards steal the show.  They just can't seem to understand much of anything, with the exception of one of them who keeps trying to explain things.  Of course, sometimes his explanations make their misunderstanding even worse.  The interplay between these characters, and between them and the university's housekeeper, is outstanding.  The characters Rincewind runs into are great, too.  There were no characters that I wished would just leave so I wouldn't have to read about them again.  Pratchett keeps the sequences that Rincewind gets into short, so there's no real opportunity for them to get stale.<br />I can't say whether or not reading the previous Rincewind books is necessary.  I personally didn't feel like I was missing anything by not having read them (with the possible exception of how Rincewind got to XXXX in the first place, though that didn't bother me too much).  I picked it up cold andenjoyed it, so you shouldn't be afraid to either.  Yet another must-read in the Pratchett collection.and enjoyed it, so you shouldn't be afraid to either.

US	50332419	R115Q2F0JVTEMT	0671578081	348946541	Komarr (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Miles finds love!  Well, maybe...	Komarr is another book in the series of adventures in the life of Miles Vorkosigan.  In this one, he and another Imperial Auditor come to the planet Komarr (a planet in the Barrayaran empire) to investigate the crash of a starship into the solar array above the planet.  This takes place a few months after \\"Memory,\\" the book where Miles got the job of Auditor.  He's still feeling his way around the job, though, trying to figure out just how to use the vast powers of his position, when to use it and when not to.  During his investigation, he stays with the Vorsoissons, another Barrayaran family living on Komarr.  There, he meets Ekaterin, and things start to steamroll from there.  Oh yeah, Miles continues the investigation as well.<br />Hopefully, that shows the order of importance in the events of this novel.  Yes, this is a romance.  I know I keep saying this in the Vorkosigan books, but it's not your normal romance.  Ekaterin, for one thing, is unattainable at the moment.  There is no bodice-ripping scenes, no \\"I must have you!\\" confrontations.  There is a rescue, but even that's not like normal rescues.  Bujold has a way of avoiding these types of clich&eacute;s in her writing and it's refreshing.  It is almost cute how this romance develops.  Miles has a crush on her almost from the first moment he sees her.  At first, she can't get past his obvious physical differences from normal men, but she learns in time.  Miles tries to do things to please her without betraying how he really feels.  It's adorable.<br />Bujold writes her characters very well.  They are all believable.  This includes the main villains of the book.  As Miles and the other investigators start tracking them down, their motivations are well-established.  It's not obvious what they're trying to do until the reader is actually told.  They're not murderers, and when there is death involved, they are noticeably affected by it.  The characters on the \\"good\\" side are also well-drawn, especially the Imperial Security officer that's based on Komarr.  He's given a past and a motivation for doing the things he does as well.<br />Ekaterin is a normal woman, not a super-heroine.  She's trapped in a situation that she can't see her way out of, but when events transpire to change that situation, she handles things with aplomb.  She's not a typically whining female, like some other writers may have portrayed her as.  Then again, female characters are Bujold's strong point.  All of her female characters are strong in their own way, but they're not emotionless.  The best compliment you can give a writer is that the characters she writes are real, and these definitely are.<br />The best thing about this book is how it fits into the series.  It represents a radical change in direction that was only hinted at in \\"Memory.\\"  The tone of the series has changed drastically.  The previous books were adventure books, even the ones that deeply examined the character of Miles and his brother.  This book is still deep with the characters, but the tone is a lot lighter.  Miles has moved on, away from his past as a mercenary captain and soldier, and he seems content with it.  It's a nice change of pace, and it allows Miles to grow, unlike some series writers where the main character is stagnant.<br />There really isn't anything bad about this book.  I greatly enjoyed reading it.  The only fault is that it's not quite as interesting as the previous books.  The pace is a bit slower.  This isn't normally a bad thing, but it just feels a bit off in this case.  It's still very enjoyable, though.  Even the worst Bujold book would be immensely readable, and this is nowhere near the worst book.  It's quite good in fact.  I would certainly recommend that you not start with this one, though.  I think it would lose some of the richness if you didn't know how Miles got to this point.  On the other hand, it's certainly understandable with no background knowledge, so if you do start with it, it's nota tragedy.edy.	2002-04-18
US	50332419	R1IU4P3VARLSOB	034540565X	65820129	American Empire: Blood & Iron	Books	2	20	21	N	N	Huge dip in quality in this great series	I have to qualify my non-recommendation here.  If you are a fan of alternate history, you may like this book.  Turtledove is the master of alternate history, and this entire series is a very interesting one.  If you don't mind Turtledove's writing, then you may enjoy it as well.  It can take great effort to get past his writing sometimes, but usually the plot makes up for it.  This time, it doesn't, not unless you've already invested some time in the series.  If this is your first Turtledove, stay away.  It's not hard to understand what's going on without reading the previous books, but this book could very well turn you away from his books if you begin with it.<br />American Empire: Blood & Iron, is yet another chapter in the ongoing alternate history saga by Harry Turtledove.  In this series, the Confederates won the Civil War, they faced off again with the United States in the 1880s, and they fought again during World War I.  The United States was allied with Germany, while the Confederates were allied with Britain, France, and Canada.<br />Blood & Iron is the first book after the war, detailing what's happening in both countries in the post-war era.  The Confederacy is going through a situation similar to what Germany went through in the real world:  massive inflation, unemployment, great poverty, reparations payments.  A Hitler-like figure, Jake Featherston, is gaining popularity with his anti-black and anti-government party.  He speaks out about how the Confederacy was stabbed in the back by its politicians and that's how they lost the war.  Meanwhile, in the North, the Socialist party has come to power, very much like post-war Britain.  The North has suffered a bit of war-weariness, and that enabled the Socialists to take over.<br />This brings to mind the first of this books many missteps.  Unlike the previous books in the series, this one is a little too much like what really happened.  It's alternate history by numbers, and Turtledove is better than that.  Replace black people with Jews and you all of a sudden have the real-world Germany.  Replace United States with Britain and you've got what really happened as well.  The subject matter of Jake's speeches is slightly different, but the parallel to the rise of Hitler is just too on the nose.  There's too few differences. During the previous books, when he was detailing the war itself, this wasn't so much of a problem.  The idea of a war on North American soil was so different, that Turtledove couldn't help but be unique.  Unfortunately, he's falling away from that with this book.  Perhaps where all of this leads will ultimately be different, but not when you take this book on its own.<br />The second problem is the characters.  During the war, everybody was involved with the war effort in one way or another, so they were able to do interesting things, even if the character itself wasn't that interesting.  Unfortunately, Turtledove doesn't have that luxury this time, and the characters suffer for it.  Some of them are just completely useless, and their story isn't interesting enough to compensate.  Nellie Semproch, to name one example, is just plain dull.  During the war, she spied on the Confederates at her caf&eacute; in an occupied Washington DC.  Now, she's newly married, still dealing with a headstrong daughter and her issues with men in general, but she's dull.  Again, plot wins over character, and when the plot is unimportant, the character becomes lifeless.  There are many other examples of this, too many to mention here.<br />There are also too many main characters.  The book is written so that each character gets a chapter, so we end up seeing vignettes in their lives.  There's no real flow, as the narrative jumps from one character to another.  I've never seen a book where you can skip so much of it if you want to and not lose any of the main story.  Occasionally, the main characters interact with each other, but not often.  This vignette method of tellingthe story also makes the book very disjointed.  The previous three books carried the story of the war from 1914 to 1917.  This book alone goes from 1917 to 1924.  It's almost like you're reading a bunch of short stories collected in a book, with some of the stories having the same characters.<br />Finally, Turtledove's writing is horrible in this book.  I think that, in the past, it's been covered by the interesting ideas and plot.  This time, though, it's very noticeable.  He's constantly repeating himself, emphasizing things.  Yes, Harry, we get that inflation is going up and up, so that $1 billion dollars will now buy you lunch, we get the fact that Nellie Semproch really dislikes men, etc.  You don't need to introduce the characters every time we see them.  Introducing them the first time we see them is good enough.  Also, Turtledove can not write a sex scene to save his life.  Please, Harry, please do the \\"fade to black\\" method.<br />Ultimately, this book is only for people who want to continue the series.  Even then, I'd suggest you check it out from the library instead of buying it, unless you're a die-hard completist.tory also makes the book very disjointed.

US	50332419	R36KD3R8Y2KE0W	067172083X	13412921	Barrayar	Books	5	32	33	N	N	So that's what happened to Miles!	Barrayar is, chronologically, the second book in the Miles Vorkosigan series, though it was written after the first few books of that series came out.  It continues the story of Miles' mother, Cordelia Naismith (though now she's married, so it's really Cordelia Vorkosigan).  It ends with a very young Miles, neatly tying into the beginning of Miles' story (which is what the rest of the series is about).  Barrayar won a Hugo award, one of the highest awards in science fiction writing, and I will have to say that it was well-deserved.  This is a fabulous book.<br />After leaving her home planet of Beta to marry Aral Vorkosigan on his home planet of Barrayar, Cordelia tries to settle into a Barrayaran retired nobles' life.  Aral has retired from politics and wants to lead a quiet life with his new wife.  Cordelia is pregnant with their son, and he just wants to live a happy life with her.  Unfortunately, events transpire to make that impossible.  The Emperor is dying and his grandson (the son died in Shards of Honor, the first book) is only four years old.  A regent must be appointed, and Vorkosigan is the only one who would be agreeable to the majority of Counts.  Thus, Cordelia and Aral's life is turned upside down when he assumes his new duties.  There is plenty of political intrigue as other Counts scheme for power because Vorkosigan wants to bring Barrayar into the current century while the conservatives want things to stay as they are.  These events even go so far as to really affect the unborn Miles in ways that will be familiar to long-time Vorkosigan fans, but which I won't spoil in case you've never read a Vorkosigan book.<br />This book is fascinating in many ways.  First, as a fan of the series already (I've only got two books to go, not counting the new one that's coming out this summer), it was very interesting to see the characters I've known and loved for so long before they became the characters I've known.  It is interesting to see them develop the attitudes that I'm familiar with.  Simon Illyan (the head of Imperial Security in the series) starts out as captain of Aral's personal security force.  Emperor Gregor, who we've only seen since he was seventeen, is now a four-year old child, aware of what's going on around him but not really understanding the political situation.  A lot of the nobility would like to control him, especially through his mother.<br />Not only the characters, but there's also many events that have been referred to in the series that we finally get to see happen on screen.  Biggest of these, of course, is what happens to Miles.  We have been told many times what happened, but it's interesting to finally see it.  Of course, there has also been a lot that hasn't been mentioned before, and those events are intriguing too.  A lot of what we know is now coloured a different way now that we know the events that surrounded it.  Some people have suggested that you should read this series chronologically, starting with Shards of Honor.  I'm almost of the opinion that you should have a few Miles books under your belt before tackling these, just because it makes these books even more interesting than they already are.<br />The second reason the book is fascinating is because of the view of Barrayaran politics that we get.  Cordelia is an outsider, and some of the practices on Barrayar are almost barbaric to her.  There is very little genetic manipulation of offspring, for one.  Mutants are killed as soon as they are born so they don't affect the gene pool.  Some other political aspects are so different than what she's used to that she needs some coaching in how to deal with them.  Thankfully, Aral's family is up to the task.  It's interesting to see these from an outsider's point of view.  I don't think the story would be nearly as effective if it was just a political tale told from within Barrayaran society.  Some of the most priceless scenes come from this weird dichotomy.<br />For fans of romance,though, there is definitely some of that in here.  This book continues to develop the relationship between Aral and Cordelia, showing how strong their love is as it withstands the pressures that politics places on it.  Again, as with Shards of Honor, this is a mature romance, though because they are actually together now (unlike Shards), there are some playful moments as well.  These are two character that the reader cares deeply about.<br />I couldn't put this book down.  It has everything:  action, romance, explosions, intrigue, great characters.  This one is certainly worth a pick up.  It also stands alone, as you don't need to read any of the other books to enjoy it.  It helps to read the others (especially Shards of Honor), but it's not mandatory.  Wonderful book.ce, though, there is definitely some of that in here.

US	50332419	R2F9A8O1LRJJGA	0671720872	160684725	Shards of Honor	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Cool beginning of the Vorkosigan saga	Shards of Honor is, chronologically, the first book in the Miles Vorkosigan series.  In fact, Miles isn't even in it.  It's the first book of two that explore the character of Cordelia Naismith, Miles' mother.  It's also the first book that Lois McMaster Bujold ever wrote, though it's not the first published.  As she explains in the afterword to Cordelia's Honor (the compilation of both Shards of Honor and Barrayar), this book was written first and submitted, rejected a few times, and then her first published book, Warrior's Apprentice, was accepted by Baen publishing.  Thus, Shards was published almost as a prequel to a series that she had already started.<br />So how is Shards?  It's very, very good, especially for a first novel.  Cordelia Naismith is on a survey mission for her home planet, Beta, when her landing party (to borrow a phrase from Star Trek) is ambushed and almost completely wiped out by a Barrayaran force that is using the planet as a supply depot.  Cordelia is captured by Captain Aral Vorkosigan, the commander of the Barrayarans.  However, things aren't quite what they seem, as Vorkosigan's crew seems to be divided between loyalty to him and mutineers.  Vorkosigan was left for dead by the mutineers, and so he and Cordelia (along with an injured member of Cordelia's team, who's mind has been blown away by a Barrayaran weapon) have to make their way to the supply depot.  The mutineers are the ones who wiped out Cordelia's crew, as Vorkosigan is too honourable a man to do something like that.  She finds herself being drawn to him during the many days of their journey, and a bond develops between them.  Cordelia ends up helping Aral in dealing with his crew.<br />Once this section of the book is over, they separate, but events transpire to bring them together again, and their bond grows.  The book details the story of how their relationship develops, deepening into a love that is a lot more mature than relationships are sometimes portrayed in science fiction.  Usually, the heroes that get involved in romances are very young, where sex is the most important thing.  The romances seem very physical.  That doesn't happen in this relationship, though, as both parties are drawn to the mind of the other person, their honour and how they react to people.  It was very refreshing.<br />The book also shows how, even as a Betan and not a Barrayaran, she gets involved in Barrayaran politics.  The political intrigue in this book is very interesting.  Clashes of honour make the character interaction fabulous.  Cordelia has problems at home based on her captivity.  She can't tell anybody what really happened when she was captured as it would make Vorkosigan's political life very difficult.  So she takes that difficulty on herself instead.  All of the main characters are well-rounded, with valid reasons for doing what they do, even if it's obvious that their actions will cause themselves grief.  The sheer inevitability of the events, and how the characters deal with them, make this a great book.<br />If you are a regular follower of the Vorkosigan series, then this book (and it's companion, Barrayar), make an interesting look into the history of the Vorkosigan family.  A lot of the events that have been referred to in the series are finally shown here. It's nice seeing how Cordelia and Aral's relationship developed, considering how set in stone they are now.  The love that has always been visible between them finally has a genesis.  It's very cool to look at this and see how our favourite characters became who they are now.<br />It's hard to believe that this was Bujold's first book.  While the prose isn't the most wonderful thing, it stands high above the usual first-timer's writing.  Some of the military aspects of the novel are a bit unbelievable,  but that has gotten better over time as she continues the series.  What you will get in this one are great characters in a science-fiction setting.  It really is a romance, though,even though it doesn't really have the trappings of one (there is no bodice-ripping, for one thing).  Even if romances turn you off, you should enjoy this, though.  It is intelligent sci-fi.even though it doesn't really have the trappings of one (there is no bodice-ripping, for one thing).  Even if romances turn you off, you should enjoy this, though.

It is bright pink, with a pink poodle lounging on a divan.  The poodle has human-like hands, and is holding a ray-gun out of a 50's sci-fi movie in one hand, and a cigarette holder with a smoking cigarette in the other.  If that doesn't indicate the tone of the book to follow, I'll eat a horse.<br />Yes, camp is the word of the day to describe this one.  Reginald Tyler (J.R.R. Tolkein, very obviously) has devoted his life to the writing of his master work, The True History of Planets.  It is a large story about elves, trolls, goblins, etc.  At least, that's the book that the Doctor has always known.  However, after arriving at a science-fiction convention in the early 21st century, he discovers that the book is no longer about such fantastical creatures, but instead it's a book about the true events on Dogworld, where the Queen is overthrown and a new Emperor has taken over.  A movie has been made of the book, which will make the situation on Dogworld even worse.  Thus, the Doctor, Anji and Fitz have to figure out what's going on and how to stop it.  They pick up some friends along the way and separate into the time stream in order to do this.  The Doctor and one poodle go to the 1940's and infiltrate the Smudgelings, Tyler's elite Cambridge writing group.  Fitz and Flossie (another acquisition) go to the 1960's and fall in with the flamboyant torch singer, Brenda Soobie, who's also more than what she seems.  Finally, Anji and another poodle go to the 1970's, where work on the film is beginning.  What follows is truly, truly...well, bizarre is probably the best way to describe it.<br />However, this is bizarre in a good way, rather than the weird events of Henrietta Street, the previous book.  Paul Magrs has written a very broad comedy, with wonderful parodies of Tolkein, C.S. Lewis, and even George Lucas in a very over the top manner (he acts out his scenes by playing with his toys).  There's even a comment on the decline of stop-motion animation and the rise of computer graphics in movies.  In fact, that's a major plot point.  And you'll never look at Noel Coward the same way again after reading this book.<br />But is it any good?  Oh yeah, it's good.  The plot is a bit too thin for this to be a 5-star book and the characters are fairly two-dimensional, but it is definitely up there.  The Eighth Doctor series really needed this break in tone after Henrietta Street.  It's funny, makes a couple of interesting points and fulfills the promise of the cover.  The comedy is so broad that the characters can't help but be two-dimensional.  There are no deep thoughts, the regulars don't develop at all, and the plot is flimsy.  But that's hardly the point in this book.  This is Dr. Who that doesn't take itself seriously, and where's the problem with that once in awhile?<br />Paul Magrs has written three other Dr. Who books, and each one has been infested (yes, that's the right word) with his character, Iris Wildthyme.  This one has her too, but she's not that intrusive or annoying in this book.  Thus, it's Magrs' best book of the lot.  She's very subdued, or at least she is once you find out who she is.  Magrs has also avoided doing some of his literary tricks that he did with his previous books that annoyed me.  This book has an ending, for one thing.  He has played with the English language, how it's used, and how literature is written in his previous ones, and they've left me cold in the process.  However, this time he plays with tone instead, and he's much better for it.<br />You will laugh at this book.  You will laugh *with* this book.  You will glory in the wonders of Dogworld,  sympathize with some of the poodles, while cursing at the other poodles.  You will laugh at an aphid named Professor Alid Jag, who is involved in a wonderful gag right at the beginning of the book.  I hope you won't be embarrassed by the cover as you read it on the bus to work.  I wasn't.  But I'm not easily embarrassed.  It is, shall we say, garish.  But that's ok.  It's well worth it.ork.

It's the fourth book to feature the City Watch, which is the police force of Ankh-Morpork, a city on the Disc.  It's also one of the best.  The City Watch, in its initial incarnation, was an homage to those no-name soldiers, troopers and other various cannon-fodder that inhabit adventure and sci-fi movies.  They're usually hapless, the hero runs right over them, and their survival rate is fairly low.  Originally, it consisted of three people, Samuel Vimes, Nobby Nobs, and Sergeant Colon.<br />This was until Carrot joined.  Carrot is a human who was raised by dwarves, thus he considers himself a dwarf.  He's the ultimate innocent, but yet he has a way of getting people to listen to him and follow him.  By the time of Jingo, he's been raised to Captain (no comic book jokes, please).  This all happened in the first City Watch book, Guards Guards.  In subsequent books, the Watch has grown almost exponentially.  It now has over 50 members, with more joining all the time. In fact, Jingo jokes a couple of times about how Vimes, the commander of the Watch, doesn't know that somebody's joined.  It's very common for him to say \\"Who's that?\\" and be told that he signed the paperwork.<br />Jingo involves an island that has suddenly appeared between Ankh-Morpork and the land of Klatch.  Klatch is based on the Arab countries of our world, and there are quite a few jokes about how something that was supposedly invented in Ankh-Morpork has been used in Klatch for years.  The people of Ankh-Morpork have a lot of the same stereotypes of Klatchians as exist in the real world about Arabs as well. Pratchett goes to great lengths to show just how stupid this is.  He portrays the actual Klatchians very well, with no actual stereotypes that I saw.<br />Anyway, both Ankh-Morpork and Klatch lay claim to this island, and thus talk of war begins.  There's an attempt on the life of a Klatchian prince and other sorts of violence start to break out in the city.  Samuel Vimes is trying to deal with all of this.  He's a simple cop who just wants to solve crimes, but sometimes the crimes are too big for one man to solve.  Events start to spiral out of control and Vimes and some of his troops find themselves in Klatch trying to stop things before the war gets out of hand.<br />There are so many wonderful characters in these City Watch books, and this one even adds some more.  The main new character is  71-hour Ahmed, a Klatchian who's more than what he seems.  Vimes has to deal with him a lot, and while he starts out seeming stereotypical, but he eventually develops into a well-rounded character.  There's Reg Shoe, who I understand is introduced in a non-City Watch book, but becomes a member of the Watch in this book.  He's a zombie.  Then there are the regulars, such as Carrot, Detritus (a troll), Constable Visit, Colon, Nobs, the Patrician (who, uncharacteristically, takes an active role in events after he's deposed from power), and finally Vimes himself.  There are just too many of them to describe them all, but they all have their hilarious moments.<br />Vimes is who the books are essentially about, and he gets the most character development.  He used to be a drunk who barely got by, and didn't have to do anything in his job.  He wasn't required to, because nobody gave the Watch any respect anyway.  Carrot gave him a sense of duty, though, and he's progressed well since then.  Jingo continues this progression, as he tries to stop the madness.  Vimes is always an interesting person to read about.  He's not a violent man, and he's trapped in a violent circumstance.  Watching him get out of it is very entertaining.<br />Discworld is known for it's humour, and this is a very funny book.  Pratchett usually cloaks his philosophical points in the laughs.  This book isn't quite as funny as the previous ones, though, and the philosophy sticks out even more in this one because of it.  It basically points out the pointlessness of mindless militarism, nationalism and patriotism.  The closest thing it is a parody of is the Falklands conflict, with a war over a worthless piece of land that nobody in their right mind would want anyway.  Along the way, though, many jokes are cracked.  The best thing about the City Watch books is that the humour seems to come from within the characters, which makes for very zany, yet almost believable, events.  That's why I prefer them.<br />This book is definitely worth a read.  You could start with it, but I would suggest that you read the first three:  Guards Guards, Men at Arms, and Feet of Clay.  There is a progression of character that you will miss if you start with Jingo.  But don't miss this one.  It's a keeper.It basically points out the pointlessness of mindless militarism, nationalism and patriotism.

US	50332419	R3TG09IXLO59VV	0563538422	767196252	The Adventuress of Henrietta Street (Doctor Who)	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Not to everybody's taste	This particular Eighth Doctor adventure is very important if you are following the series in order, as many big things happen in it.  When Lawrence Miles writes a Doctor Who book, you have to stand up and take notice. While \\"cosmic\\" may not be a good word for the events in this novel, \\"trans-dimensional\\" might be.<br />How is it as a story?  For me, it wasn't that great.  First, to summarize.  The Doctor has come to Earth to help protect it against yet another dire threat:  babewyns (yes, that is the proper spelling).  These apes are creatures from the edge of human understanding of the cosmos.  As human understanding starts to approach this edge, the babewyns are attracted to Earth and start wreaking havoc, killing people very violently.  Why hasn't this happened before?  Because the Doctor's people, the Time Lords, have been guardians of the cosmos, preventing stuff like this from happening.  Due to events in previous books (that I won't spoil here), they no longer serve that purpose.  The Doctor's link with his people is gone, and he needs to link himself with Earth instead in order to prevent stuff like this from happening.<br />Thus, he comes to London in 1782, where he meets up with a group of humans who also have a basic understanding of the way time works, as well as other \\"occult\\" things.  The Doctor's going to marry a virgin woman to link himself with the planet.  It's all very metaphysical in scope, and is a bit hard to describe.  This group of humans he allies himself with are prostitutes in a bordello run by Scarlette, who is one of the experts on this sort of occult stuff.  The rest of the prostitutes have some ability in this as well.  The book details the year that takes place from February 1782 to February 1783, which includes the events leading up to the wedding, and the events that take place immediately afterward.  It also introduces another character who will feature in future Eighth Doctor books, Sabbath.  He is a bit of a nemesis for the Doctor, though he's not above helping if it serves his own ends as well.<br />So why isn't the book that great?  The main reason for me is that the book is written as a \\"history\\" book instead of a novel, as if some historian in the 20th century is looking back at the events in the book and trying to cobble them together from writings produced at the time.  Thus, there are a lot of passages similar to \\"no one knows exactly what the Doctor said to Scarlette, but it would seem likely to go something like this:\\"  This creates a barrier between the reader and the characters, making it almost impossible to say whether or not the people in the novel are in character.  The reader is almost removed from the action.  There is virtually no dialogue.<br />This isn't necessarily a bad way to do a novel, as long as it's not repeated often.  It's an interesting technique.  Unfortunately, what Miles goes on and does is make this \\"history book\\" one of those pop-history books, not really written by a historian, but more by somebody with an interest in the topic but no training in how to write a book about it.  The text goes all over the place, jumping back and forth in the action like a novel would, but it just doesn't work in the pseudo-historical format.  It has faux-cliffhangers similar to \\"...which Scarlette would find out later, to her regret.  But getting back to the Doctor....\\"  That's not an exact quote out of the book, but it's the type of \\"cliffhanger\\" I'm talking about.<br />One thing I really did like about the book, though, were the \\"babewyns.\\"  These apes, while not exactly terrifying, were quite disturbing, especially in their home dimension. Considering the TV series has been known in the past for \\"forcing kids behind the couch while they're watching,\\" it was nice to finally get a creepy enemy in the book series. The wasted \\"city\\" that their dimension consists of is very well-drawn, too.  Miles has always been an impressive wordsmith, and the prose shows that.  While I don't like the style it was written in, I like how it was written (does that make sense? )<br />Ultimately, I found \\"Adventuress\\" a frustrating book.  It has big events, and I follow the book series so I want to read each one.  But it was hard-going through this one.  The text is quite small.  Thus, it's very dense.  The style works against the book as far as I'm concerned.  Because of the style, the characters aren't really that three dimensional.  They can't be, because you're never sure whether or not the narrator is being accurate or not.<br />If you're a regular reader of the series, then you should probably read this book (though if you are, you probably don't need a recommendation anyway).  If you're not, then you may just want somebody to point out the \\"big events\\" in the novel and move on to the next one.'t like the style it was written in, I like how it was written (does that make sense? )<br />Ultimately, I found \\"Adventuress\\" a frustrating book.

Instead, it takes place in \\"The Old Kingdom,\\" and is take-off on ancient Egypt.  How does it fare?<br />Let's call it a triple.  It's wonderfully funny, and definitely a 5-star book.  It only suffers in comparison to the other Discworld books that I've read, in that it takes awhile before it's laugh out loud funny.  The whole book is definitely worth reading though, and your patience will be rewarded in spades once things actually start happening.<br />The book is about Teppic, the son of the king, who has gone to Ankh-Morpork to learn to be an assassin.  The first section of the book consists of scenes of his final examination intercut with scenes of his joining the assassins' school.  This section has its amusing moments, but it didn't make me guffaw like the City Watch trilogy of books did.  The section gives information on Teppic's character, which does inform the rest of the book, and is thus valuable.  It was just missing something.<br />There are also scenes back in the Kingdom, where Teppic's father is going a bit insane.  He ends up falling off of a balcony while identifying with the local seagulls.  Thus, Teppic is drawn back home to take his place.  When Teppic gets back, he finds most of the rituals and values that dominate the kingdom grate with the values that he learned while he was in Ankh-Morpork.  Meanwhile, Teppic's dad is dead, and he's not liking it.<br />Things steamroll from there, and I won't give away any of the rest of the stuff.  Once Teppic gets back home, things get a lot better in this book.  The laughs come very frequently, and nothing is spared from Pratchett's wit.  The take-off on the Trojan Horse story has to be seen to be believed, as well as the Philospher's Cafe.  And next time you see a camel, you'll be wondering what's going through his head.<br />The main problem with the book is that it seems a bit detached from the situation.  In the City Watch books, most of the humour comes directly out of what is happening, making the events that Pratchett is describing feel important, at least to the characters.  Pyramids, though, seems different than that.  The jokes are funny, but the events that they are coming out of seem very inconsequential when you think about it.  And when the event in question is as big as it is in this book (can't say more without spoilers), inconsequential is the last thing it should feel like.<br />Still, that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the book.  Some people don't like the zany, madcap type of humour that Pratchett delivers, and they should stay away from it.  But it's certainly worth a pick up for anybody with a funny bone.that it seems a bit detached from the situation.

It stars the Eighth Doctor, Fitz, and Anji, and has some wonderful scenes for all three of them.  Bucher-Jones and Hale provide a science fiction explanation for the magical events on the planet, so any Who fans who don't like magic in their Who and were upset with the previous novel (City of the Dead) can be assured that this one is \\"safe.\\"<br />The Doctor and his companions land on a planet and are very soon cut off from the TARDIS by forest that has grown instantly around the ship so they can't get back in.  They start exploring the world, and all three of them stumble into three different situations that look like fairy tales.  Fitz gets involved in a quest with two princes, Anji gets trapped by a witch into a contract to be a servant to six spoiled young girls.  Finally, the Doctor gets involved with trying to revive a sleeping princess.  Things steamroll from there, getting more and more strange as different fairy tale aspects start mixing.  Things start to make a bit more sense for the reader once the Doctor figures out what's going on, but the ride up to that point is enjoyable as well.<br />Meanwhile, there is a starship with a crew consisting of three races, the Vuim, the Abanak, and humans, who are trying to establish mining rights for this world and the white singularity that's around it.  To be honest, the plot surrounding the Vuim grinds the story to a halt every time the book goes back to it, and it has to work hard to retrieve its momentum when the story shifts back to one of the other subplots.  The other aspects of the crew, though, are much more interesting, and the humans do provide impetus for the other subplots involving the Doctor and crew.  In fact, its hilarious watching the rivalry between Anji and Christina, the human ship captain, after Christina gets drawn into Anji's plot.<br />The fairy tales that Bucher-Jones and Hale draw upon are not the nice, tidy ones that get read to children nowadays, but the ugly ones that were the original Grimm's tales.  It can be a rude awakening for the reader who wasn't aware that Grimm's tales are actually quite grim and is expecting something else.  The authors make great use of the inspiration though, putting the characters through their paces with elegant prose, interesting situations, and \\"what the f---?\\" revelations.<br />The main revelation comes about 2/3 through the novel, and it results in the only drawback to this book.  Once the tales are \\"explained,\\" the technobabble gets a bit thick.  It's nothing a science fiction fan isn't used to, but it's sad that it degenerates to that.  Given the magical nature of City of the Dead (the previous book), it would have been nice to have a little more magic and a little less science in this one.  I guess that would have offended the purists, though.<br />This book is not one to be raced through.  It's a book that should be devoured in chunks and savoured.  The writing is wonderful, the plot is interesting, and the characters are marvelously portrayed.  Something is done with each one of them, and this book is much more of an ensemble piece than the last couple of Eighth Doctor Adventures have been.  It's good to see that the line is continuing such good stories.  This one makes three in a row now.es that get read to children nowadays, but the ugly ones that were the original Grimm's tales.

Sometimes you could even see the slow motion choreography of the action scenes.<br />Sarah Jane Smith, a companion of the Third and Fourth Doctor, is enlisted unwittingly by the Seventh Doctor in a secret plan that I won't reveal.  Suffice it to say that, as always in a McIntee novel, things aren't necessarily what they seem to be at the outset.  The Doctor seems to Sarah to be acting severely out of character, and she wants to get to the bottom of why.  She finds out, though, that sometimes you don't really want to know the answer to your questions.  Throw in some Hong Kong triads, secret government agencies (lots of them!), and stir, and you get a pot-boiling action flick masquerading as a book.<br />The prose is very workmanlike, with many descriptions given in pop culture references.  Luckily, if you're interested at all in Doctor Who (and thus, reading this book), you won't have any trouble understanding them.  It still would be nice to have these lessened a bit, though.  The rest of the story is told in rapid succession, with rapid scene changes that make it seem even more like a movie.  There is rarely a 2-page spread that doesn't have at least one scene change.  This makes for quick reading, and also makes the book ideal for reading in small chunks if all you have is a couple of minutes at a time.  While the prose is simple, it fits the style of the book, which is a plus.<br />The characters are rather two-dimensional, but that's not the point in this book, so that's not as much of a problem as it would be otherwise.

Nothing more, nothing less.  It's not literature, it's not trying to be.  It does its job, and it does it well.  If you like an adventure yarn, you'll probably like this one.  Go ahead and pick it up.	2002-02-19

After a few books dealing with the gods and their return to Dellah, and then Benny disappearing for awhile, Tears brings her back to her basics, in a sense:  archeology.  Benny joins an expedition with Irving Braxatiel, her ex-husband Jason, and a few others, to delve into the secrets of the Oracle of the Lost.  Unfortunately, those secrets can drive you mad, and Benny is no exception to that.  The mystery then deepens even more.<br />Justin Richards has written a wonderful book in Tears of the Oracle.  The Oracle is almost tragic, in a sense.  The characters are all well-defined and play off each other nicely.  The prose is typical Richards:  very good, but not great, but it definitely suits the book.  As typical of Richards, there are plenty of twists and turns and interesting situations.  Benny is back to her old self after a few books, and it's wonderful to see.  I'd have to say that this is the best of the Benny books, or at least it's my favourite.<br />There's one bad thing, and it's a piece of fanwank that just goes a bit too far.  The book has a passing mention (without naming names, of course) of a certain Time Lord who Benny traveled around with for awhile.  There's one section in the book that ties down that Time Lord's relationship with another character just a bit too tightly in my book.  I enjoyed some of the in-jokes along these lines in previous books, but this one nailed it down too much in my book.  I like my in-jokes vague.<br />Still, that's a small bit, and I can ignore the fact that it ever happened if I want.  It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the novel at all.  It's too bad that there weren't more Benny books of this quality before the line died out.  This one is a worthwhile addition to it.	2002-02-15

Every one of them deals with adultery in one form or another.  Sometimes a past adultery informs the plot of the story, sometimes the ending of it is the driving force.  None of the stories actually deals with the beginning of it, except in flashback.  Many times, the parties involved think back to the beginning and try to figure out what has gone wrong, and why a thrilling, secretive experience has become dull and boring.<br /><br />The highlight of the novel has to be Abyss, the last story in the book. It's the longest story, and allows Ford to really get into the character of the two protagonists.  Again, you see the beginning of their affair in flashback, the sudden spark when they first touch, and the red hot desire when they first truly look into each other's eyes.  When the characters are sent to Phoenix for a convention, you see how their feelings have changed as the height of their passion comes crashing down into the dullness of reality and they each see what the other person is really like.  Watching this relationship crumble, and then seeing the unexpected (at least to me) resolution to the story, was very intriguing, and made me want to finish the story as soon as possible.<br /><br />The characters in each story are seekers, in a way.  They are all searching for something to make their life complete.  They are lost souls, searching for the fulfillment that life should bring, but doesn't always.  Having an affair seems to them, at first, to fill that gap, but it never actually does.  That's what makes the stories so depressing, in a way:  seeing the fruitless search for life.  Only one story has what's even close to a happy ending, and even that happiness is caused by the realization that their marriage is truly over.  Most of the stories end with the characters having fallen, picking themselves up and resolving to move on through life's dense fog.  A little wiser, perhaps.  Or perhaps not.  Some people never learn.<br /><br />Still, depressing or not, I found all of the stories worthwhile to read.  From the short vignettes to the longer pieces, each one contained interesting situations, or a nice twist, or even just making a point about life.  I can't say I enjoyed the book, but I certainly did find it fascinating.  I have never read any of Ford's stuff, but I may have to now that I've read some of his short fiction.ot.

It's not very taxing, and best of all it's self-contained.  There are *no* sequels (or if there will be one, it too should be self-contained).  The book begins, things happen, and then it ends, with no \\"to be continued\\" in sight.  In this day and age, I found that very satisfying.  It's very hard to pick up a good fantasy book nowadays without finding yourself engaged in an almost never-ending series.<br />This book is about Alana, a woodsinger and keeper of the Tree in her village.  She's the person who keeps the Tree up to date on what's going on, and the Tree is the entity that not only watches over the village, but also contains the memories of the village, from previous songs sung to it.  When two of the village children are kidnapped, she has to use the Tree's magic to assist the rescue party.  In doing so, she find she has to extend herself beyond any capabilities that she's ever had before.<br />I found Alana an interesting character, well-rounded with intelligence and doubts about her abilities.  She did tend to whine a bit, but it never overpowered her characterization, as Klasky doesn't make her go on and on about it.  The other characters in the book are well-drawn as well,  with a few twists adding to their characters that make them even more interesting.  There are definite good guys and bad guys, but the good guys are not so \\"heroic\\" that there is no doubt they will live.  They do have to make a bit of a sacrifice to save the day.<br />There are two things that bring this novel down to 4 stars.  First, the kids.  I know Harriet found them lovable, but I found Reade incredibly annoying.  I realize that there is a reason he's presented this way, but this knowledge  didn't make my teeth go on edge any less when reading his sections of the book.  Still, overall, he wasn't *that* bad, and the novel is still good.<br />The second reason, though, is a little more of a problem.  The ending feels incredibly staged and choreographed.  There is no real reason given for the timing of the ceremony, thus no reason given why it takes so long for them to actually do it.  Instead, though, it's timed incredibly well to coincide with when the heroes are ready to do something about it.  That seemed a bit contrived to me.<br />Putting those two things aside, though, this is still a very good book, and well worth the time it takes to read it.ttle more of a problem.

US	50332419	R1JMZOBN2W97CR	0563538392	302118637	The City of the Dead (Doctor Who)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Magical Who	I've reviewed three Barbara Hambly novels that take place in New Orleans, and one of my favourite things about them is the sense of place evoked.  Lloyd Rose does a similarly impressive job of capturing the New Orleans setting in City of the Dead.  The atmosphere is simply riveting, and she makes you feel like you're down there with the Doctor, experiencing everything about the city: the architecture, the society, the magic.  It really makes me want to take a vacation there.<br />Speaking of magic, that's what this book is about.  In Doctor Who stories, real magic is a rare thing.  There's always some &quot;scientific&quot; explanation.  That's been a comfort to many Doctor Who fans who don't want their series &quot;tainted&quot; with magic.  Rose does leave them an out at the beginning, talking about &quot;energy&quot; and the like.  But when you boil the plot down, it's about magic.  There are spirits, elementals, arcane forces, and charms.  This fan doesn't mind that much.<br />The regulars stand out in this novel.  For the first time in a long time, the story is about the Doctor and he carries the plot.  He has been well-characterized in previous novels, but it's been a long time since he's been the prime mover in a book.  Sometimes he's on the periphery, and other times he's mainly reacting to events.  He's come to New Orleans to investigate a bone charm that he found at the bottom of his wardrobe, even though he doesn't remember how it might have gotten there.  His current amnesia makes that even harder.  The person he asks to look at it ends up dead, and thus the plot begins.  We really get inside the Doctor's thoughts in this one, and what a jumble they are.<br />Anji and Fitz are sidelined a bit in this book in order to emphasize the Doctor, but they do have some important stuff to do.  They do a bit of the Doctor's legwork in the investigation.  They both get some very good character moments, and Anji actually gets the beginning of a social life.  She has been a very interesting character in the past, but there hasn't really been a lot done with her.  In City of the Dead, she begins to come out of that.  Fitz is normal Fitz, being worried about the Doctor and trying hard to figure out what  is going on.  He gets to make a couple of intuitive leaps, showing off his intelligence and quick thinking, but otherwise, he's basic Fitz by numbers.  However, there is a scene at the end of the book between Fitz and Anji that is just so wonderful that even this minor complaint  about him is overshadowed.  It's brief, only about a page (if that), but it shines a new light on their relationship.<br />The original characters are very well done too, though Dupre is just a bit too comical to be believable.  Rust is very interesting, as is Thales and Teddy Acree.  Laura's a bit of a cipher, but she's not too bad.  The cast is small, but that let's Rose concentrate on the characterization of the people who are in the book, and it's all the better for it.  The plot is intriguing and takes a number of twists that I didn't really see coming.<br />Read this book for the atmosphere, the evocative prose,  and the characters.  Stay away from it if you're a Who fan that can't stand the thought of \\"magic\\" tainting your beloved series.  Otherwise, though, revel in another great adventure of the Eighth Doctor.

After having explored Miles' brother Mark's character so vividly in Mirror Dance, Bujold turns to her main character in Memory, bringing Miles to a turning point in his life and showing what makes him tick.  She does this by having Miles go through a crisis of conscience that ends up blowing up in his face.<br />After what happened to him in Mirror Dance, Miles goes through some introspection about the way his career has gone.  What he does puts him at odds with Simon Illyan, the head of Imperial Security.  The results from this send Miles on a downward mental spiral.  While all of this is going on, a plot against Simon presents itself, and Miles has to figure out what's going on.  Seeing how Miles deals with all of this is one of the best things about the book.  The last couple of Bujold books have shown a great maturity in writing style that I really like.<br />A couple of reviewers have mentioned how predictable the Simon plot is.  I have to agree, but I would say that it's beside the point.  The reason for this novel is not the plot against Simon, but how Miles deals with it, and how he incorporates it into his dealing with his other issues.  It doesn't matter that the plot is predictable, because the only reason it is there is to showcase Miles and his thought processes.  In handling this dilemma, Miles makes great strides in his maturity.  He's gone past the daring-do of his Admiral Naismith persona and become a much more well-rounded person.  He discovers that he's been denying his real self as Miles Vorkosigan, and burying it in Admiral Naismith.<br />It's a great treat to read this book and see how Miles progresses.  He comes out of the book a much better person than he went into it as.  I really like the way the character has progressed.  I also like the way Bujold has refused to leave Miles a static character.  Too many series fall into that trap of never having major changes to the lead character.  Miles is still incredibly interesting, but he's not the same man who started the series.<br />I would not recommend starting your reading of the Miles series with Memory.  It references every single book and story that Miles has starred in so far.  Everything is explained well enough for the first time reader, but I think you'd get more enjoyment out of it if you've read the previous books.  However, Memory is a standout in the series, and should definitely be read by any Bujold fan.

It's a bit longer then the other ones, and uses that space for some deep psychological studies of two characters who are a lot alike, but different in so many ways. Other reviews have summarized the book, so I won't bother here.<br />First, I loved the double meaning of the title.  Not only does it have the obvious meaning (both Miles and his identical clone are featured), but it also has some meaning to each character individually.  Both of them have their past held up to them, and they have to figure out how to change with the times.  There is enormous character growth for both of them in this book.<br />For the first time in the series, you get another character's point of view besides Miles.  Mark makes for a very interesting character, and the book is more about him then it is about Miles (though Miles still plays a very prominent part and makes the most out of his time).  The last we saw of Mark, he had gone off on his own, freed by Miles, but forever resenting Miles for what his keepers did to him to make him more like Miles.<br />Once Miles is removed from the picture after the aborted raid, the story takes Mark to Barrayar, where he meets his mother and father and learns how he will have to become immersed in Barrayaran politics if Miles is actually gone for good.  He grows a lot on Barrayar, mainly from his mother's influence.  Bujold really digs deep into Mark's character, making him do anything possible to avoid having to be Miles.  He just wants to be accepted for himself.<br />Later in the book, Mark is put through the ringer, with scenes of torture that, while they aren't necessarily described in graphic detail, really can leave the reader feeling uncomfortable.  It's not gratuitous, as the torture is very important for Mark's character arc, but it is unpleasant.  This is one of the things that marks this book as more mature than just a general military space novel might be.<br />The other thing that marks this maturity is the depth of the character study.  Mark's character arc is very thorough, but even Miles goes through hell at times.  In his trials, he learns a lot about himself and about Mark.  He goes over his feelings for Mark, showing his depth of feeling for him.  He never blames Mark for what he has done, knowing it's his conditioning that caused most of it. He analyzes his life as it's happened so far, his loves and his personality.<br />This book is a lot slower going then the previous novels have been.  However, that's not because it becomes a book to slog through, but because it is so deep that you have to take the time to absorb what is happening.  It's the best book in the series so far by a long shot, and well worth the time it takes to read it./>The other thing that marks this maturity is the depth of the character study.

If the situations weren't so funny at times, it would be truly tragic.<br />After the daring rescue from the prison camp in Borders of Infinity, Miles (in his Admiral Naismith guise) and his mercenary fleet run to Earth after being chased by Cetagandan assasination squads.  Naismith now has a price on his head, and he's trying to lie low.  What better place than a backwater like Earth?  And what better way to do it than to become his &quot;real&quot; persona again, Miles Vorkosigan, thus making Admiral Naismith disappear for awhile?  Unfortunately for him, that's easier said than done, as one event keeps building on another, until he's knee deep in it all again.<br />This is another great entry in the series, as Miles once again gets to show his quick thinking, and how that quick thinking sometimes leads to even worse problems.  Most of the time, Miles is like one of those guys who balances the spinning plates, frantically running from pole to pole to keep the plates spinning before they fall off and break.  Watching him do this is half the fun of the series.<br />The characters really make this book, though.  Some of the situations are extremely contrived (I'm not sure I buy Miles' reasoning for why he came up with a story that just happens to have been true), but you care about the characters involved and you want to see how they get out of the situation.  There is some character progression for Miles and Elli Quinn that was long needed.  The book also introduces a couple of new characters who are interesting as well.<br />The great thing about this book, as in Warrior's Apprentice, is that there's an underlying sense of tragedy in the novel, but it's offset by a very humorous tone.  Surprisingly, this doesn't jar at all, as some of the best comedy has tragic undertones.  Galeni's situation does become very tragic, yet it's handled very deftly by Bujold.  I like it when a writer is able to do that.<br />All in all, this is a really good book.  It's certainly not a place to start the series (though I don't think you'd be lost if you did), but it is entertaining and well worth your time.>All in all, this is a really good book.

It's an even worse thing when all six characters (and the group they form) are an integral part of the novel.  Chloe, Meg, Joan, Ralph, Tommy and Josh are the most grating characters I've read in a long while.  It's not that their necessarily uninteresting, but every bit of dialogue they have seems to be insulting comments about one another, tedious attempts at humour.  This continues throughout the book.<br />The story itself isn't too bad.  There are interesting puzzles:  what is really going on in the parapsychology research laboratory at East Wessex college?  Just what is it that Chloe is seeing and running from?  Is it the same as what seems to be stalking Leela?  Does it have something to do with the water?<br />Unfortunately, the story's resolution devolves into bunches of technobabble.  Quite a few pages are devoted to it as the Doctor tries to stop the villain of the piece.  It's too bad, too, because the book was refreshingly free of it until this point.  Everything was being described in terms of psychological suspense.  The technobabble-filled finale then ends up leading to a truly unsatisfying resolution that I can't mention without spoilers.<br />The strength of the novel, as with any of the Chris Boucher novels, is Leela.  Boucher knows Leela intimately, and she always comes to life when he writes her.  She is a warrior, trained to fight, but also trained to think.  She's a simple woman from a primitive society, but that doesn't make her stupid.  Boucher does a good job of showing that.  She thinks through her actions, but yet she also acts instinctively.  She sees things in terms that she's familiar with.  Her internal monologues work really well as she works through everything.  Her exchanges with the Doctor are even better.<br />In the end, though, the book is unsatisfying.  It's not a bad story, but the characters (except Leela) and the really bad ending bring it down.  It may be worth reading, but I'm not sure it's worth buying.the characters (except Leela) and the really bad ending bring it down.

All three stories are different in tone, thus showing multiple aspects of Miles' character.  All of them are well done and worth reading.  They aren't really essential to get the &quot;whole story&quot; of Miles, but they do get referred to again, so it's nice to actually know what's being talked about.<br />The first one, Mountains of Mourning, is probably the best of the bunch.  Miles has just graduated from the academy, and is on vacation at the family mansion in the country.  He helps a woman from a local village get an audience with his father, and in return for that, his father tasks him with solving the murder of her infant daughter.<br />This is a real growing experience for Miles, and comes at a perfect time for him.  He has to deal with the remaining prejudices that still lurk in the less urbanized areas of Barrayar, and especially how they apply to him.  Bujold effectively shows his indecision as he starts out wishing he had never gotten involved, and ends up being enormously glad he did.  This is an effective character-building story for Miles, and he definitely learns a lot about himself.<br />The second story, Labyrinth, isn't quite as effective.  There really isn't a lot of emotional involvement, though it does have some touching scenes.  Again, in some ways, Miles has to learn about prejudices and first impressions as he gets involved in the retrieval of a genetic experiment gone wrong.  It's very interesting watching Miles' attitude change toward Taura as he learns more.<br />With the exception of a few scenes in the middle, though, this story is straight action-adventure as Miles has to continually use his brains to get himself out of sticky situations.  It's certainly not a bad story (the story of Taura is actually kind of touching), but it's the weakest in the group.<br />Finally, there is Borders of Infinity.  I have to agree with another reviewer in saying that I marvel at how Bujold wrote this completely from Miles' point of view without actually revealing any of the planning.  However, once you know what's going on, a lot of the stuff shown previously actually makes sense.  It was very intriguing.<br />This story really showcases Miles' ability to think on his feet and talk people into things they might not otherwise have agreed to.  There are also quite a few incidents that show just how physically fragile he is, though.  You hear about it a lot in the books, but they haven't really shown it that often, but this story does.<br />The framing story serves its purpose.  It's not really that interesting (though Simon is a great character), but it introduces the stories very nicely.  I'm reading these chronologically, so I was a bit worried when I found out the framing story takes place after Brothers in Arms, but there's really nothing in it that spoils Brothers.<br />All in all, this is a very effective set of stories.  There's an emotional one, an action one, and one that's a bit in between.  Variety is the spice of life, as they say.

I continually marvel at how some of these authors create these societies out of whole cloth.<br />Miles and his cousin Ivan are at the state funeral of the Cetagandan Empress when things start to go wrong (as they inevitably do with Miles).  First, he's the target of an attack, and then things steamroll from there.  Miles finds himself embroiled in a plot to change Cetagandan society forever.<br />The really good thing about this book is that it's not as full of coincidences as the Vor Game was.  One event led to another logically.  There were no &quot;chance meetings&quot; that ended up moving the plot along.  This is a big plus, because it's a big reason I only gave the Vor Game 4 stars.<br />Miles once again has to continually use his head to get out of increasingly precarious positions.  He gets to do things that no other outlander has ever done.  Ivan is once again the ladies'  man who gets caught up in Miles schemes.  He continually wants to call in the authorities but Miles won't let him.  The interplay between the two of them is priceless.<br />The major problem with the book is that it's not that entertaining.  The study of a society based so highly on genetics is interesting, but the story around it doesn't quite hold up its end of the bargain.  The characters (other than Miles and Ivan) aren't as well-drawn as before.  They aren't quite cardboard, but they're maybe 2.5 dimensional.  The other good guys, for the most part, are around mostly to frown at Miles and let him get on with doing what he's doing.<br />Still, when I say it's not that entertaining, that's in relation to the rest of the series I've read so far.  Compared to most other books it is very good.  You certainly won't regret reading it if you can get your hands on it.	2002-01-15

I will admit right up front that I did not finish this book.  I've gone back and forth on whether or not I should even write a review because of that.  Even as short a time ago as this morning, I wasn't going to do it.  However, after further review and a little bit of encouragement, I've decided to put my feelings out there and let you be the judge on whether or not it's appropriate.<br />Fortress in the Eye of Time is the story of Tristen, a man (actually he's a creation of a wizard, called a &quot;Shaping&quot;) who is displaced from his home and must fend for himself after his guardian and mentor (the wizard) disappears.  He journeys along the road he believes the wizard intended him to take, and winds up in the middle of a lot of court intrigue.  Once he gets involved in this, the viewpoint switches back and forth between Tristen and Cefwyn, heir to the throne.<br />I made it half-way through the book before I had to put it down.  Tristen is innocent, a man to be shaped by the events surrounding him, a template to be impressed upon.  He also apparently is something else, as memories and skills keep returning to his head unbidden.  Ultimately, though, he is a bore.  I didn't find him interesting in the slightest.  The wide-eyed innocent routine can be done well, but here it bored me to tears.  He kept going on about the pigeons and the Owl and the wizard...on and on and on.  It got really tiresome.<br />The first 200 pages of the book are just about Tristen, his creation, and his life with Mauryl, the wizard in question.  There are hints of a dark history that Mauryl is part of, and trying to protect Tristen from until he can be groomed to handle things.  But mostly it's about Tristen and his life &quot;growing up.&quot;  It became very tedious.  It wouldn't have been so bad if Tristen had been interesting.  Instead, though, he whines a lot, he makes mistakes and gets yelled at by Mauryl, worries about what's going to happen if Mauryl goes away, worries about why he keeps making mistakes, etc.  Then, when something finally happens and Tristen is forced to go on the road, it gets a little better.  There are actually other characters for Tristen to interact with.  Unfortunately, this doesn't help much.  He's still not interesting.<br />The first scene with Cefwyn has him dallying with two women before he's interrupted with the news of Tristen's arrival.  This scene really jars with the rest of the scenes in the book that I have read, because after it's over, he shows almost no trace of being the type of person who would do this.  The scene almost makes him look like a buffoon; a spoiled, royal brat who has nothing better to do then have fun with women and who would rather be doing that than preparing to run the kingdom when his father dies.  This doesn't fit the character I know from the rest of the scenes that contain him.<br />Once Tristen meets Cefwyn, the viewpoint switches between the two characters.  It takes another 50-75 pages for anything further to really happen.  Instead, a lot of history is imparted, a lot of intrigue among the nobles is hinted at or discussed, and Tristen misses his pigeons some more.<br />As this goes on it gets more and more tedious to get through the writing.  I have no trouble with authors who use language well.  Cherryh is one of those authors.  The text is very dense, but very well-utilized.  However, I do mind having to work through the text when I don't feel like I'm being rewarded for it with an interesting story.  Unfortunately, in this book, that's how I felt.<br />I reached page 372 before I gave up.  Something was finally starting to happen, but 1) I don't think I should have to read almost half of a book before something interesting happens; and 2) I found that, even with what happens at this point, I was caring less and less.  I had no vested interest in either of the two main characters, and this event where I stopped introduces a few new characters who I also didn't have any interest in.  I decided I had books to read that I was more looking forward to.<br />I give the book one star.  However, I fully realize that this is a personal taste, even more so than a review usually is.  I have tried to read five of Cherryh's books, and I've made it through three of them.  Of those three, I only really liked one of them.  She's a three-time Hugo award winner, and she has a very big following among SF fans.  I just don't think her style fits with what I enjoy reading.  I've noticed, reading the SF newsgroup, that she does tend to attract strong opinions either way, with few &quot;well, it's not bad&quot; reactions.<br />My suggestion is to pick up this one up at the library and test it out (or a bookstore that lets you read a bit of a book before you buy).  You may very well think this is a 5-star book.  Or, you may be like me and find it completely uninteresting.nterest in.

US	50332419	RS0NHG96QKPYO	0061057649	861145707	Feet of Clay (Discworld)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Part 3 of the City Watch series of Discworld	I just finished the third book in the City Watch series, Feet of Clay.  It is another home run for Pratchett.  The book is not quite as funny as the first two, but it says even more about the human condition.  No human institution is left unscathed as he hits politics, religion, social class, and racism.  All in one book, while still filling it full of parody, jokes, and slapstick comedy.  What more could you ask for?<br />The plight of the golem in this book is very well-staged.  Pratchett presents some very biting commentary on life in general and our attitudes toward different people, using the golems as a focal point.  Are golems really alive?  Do they constitute a race, and thus they can be discriminated against?  Some of the arguments parallel the Star Trek: The Next Generation Episode &quot;Measure of a Man,&quot; where Picard asks some of these same questions.  Once you create a group of &quot;beings,&quot; at what point do these beings become a race?  Do they have a soul?  Pratchett doesn't go that far, but he does present some very good points about all of this.<br />The character development of Carrot and Vimes continues as well.  Carrott is now a captain in the Watch, and thus has authority (authority which he's always really had, due to his charisma).  Vimes continues his determination to have the Watch be a respected institution as Carrot's devotion to duty continues to rub off on him.  He has grown from a character wallowing in drink to forget about the Watch and his problems, to a well-rounded person who's determined to make the best of himself and watch out for his people.<br />The Watch has grown in size as well, with many more members.  They now have a forensic alchemist (a female dwarf who has decided to start actually showing she's female), along with a gargoyle and a man who likes to distribute religious literature.  Of course, there are also many more unnamed ones.  Pratchett does  a wonderful job of giving each of these characters three dimensions.<br />I didn't find this book quite as funny as the first two, but it still does have many great moments.  The lessening of the humour is off-set by some great social commentary.  Don't be fooled, though.  This isn't a social treatise.  It's a funny book that makes some good social points.  And isn't that what good social commentary is all about?  Read this book, but read the first two before this one.  I think you'll get more enjoyment out of this one if you have the basis of the first two books.  It's certainly not mandatory to understand what's going on, but it helps.nsions.<br />I didn't find this book quite as funny as the first two, but it still does have many great moments.

As can be seen from my review of it, I thought Guards Guards! was a marvelously funny book, and a great homage to the guards in most movies and books who have a very thankless job.  Men at Arms, though, surpasses even that.<br />First of all, the ranks of the City Watch are expanded, with Detritus -DON'T SALUTE, the Troll, Cuddy, the Dwarf, and Angua, a woman who's not all she appears to be.  Dwarves and Trolls don't get along, which provides the meat to some very funny scenes between Detritus and Cuddy, including a great scene where Cuddy is teaching Detritus how to count. There are even more jokes in this one then there were in Guards Guards (or at least, I laughed at more of them).<br />Captain Vimes is retiring in a few days, which doesn't give the watch much time to figure out who's responsible for all the strange murders happening.  Never fear, though, Corporal Carrot is here!  The character development in this book makes this so much more than just a funny fantasy.  Vimes is really starting to second guess his life.  Carrot is maturing greatly, even if he still is plain, simple Carrot.  Even Nobbs and Colon grow as characters.<br />In Vimes, you see a character agonizing over who he is and what he is becoming.  He's not sure he wants to live the life that's staring him in the face.  Yet he's still the take-charge guy he became in the first book.  He's the emotional centre of the book and while he's not always involved, his presence is always being felt.<br />All of this sounds dreadfully serious, but it's wrapped in a plot that goes from one hilarious event to another.  There were three or four straight pages where I couldn't stop laughing as I read, and every other page had a treat (I just managed to stifle the laughter in order to not disturb my wife's sleep).  The mix of comedy and character development is made perfectly.  If you have no interest in serious stuff, you can ignore that aspect of the book and just revel in the jokes.<br />I'm moving on to Feet of Clay now, and I'm optimistic.  Pratchett hasn't missed with me so far.  Do yourself a favour and try this series.t of Clay now, and I'm optimistic.  Pratchett hasn't missed with me so far.

Books	5	3	3	N	N	More Pratchett hilarity	I read the Colour of Magic a long time ago, and while it was funny, I didn't really appreciate it.  I haven't really had the chance to go back and read more Pratchett until I picked up the City Watch trilogy at the local library.  Guards Guards! is the first book to feature the Watch, and it is a great introduction to them.<br />The book hits the ground running with wonderful take-off on the idea of pass-phrases to get into a building.  I couldn't stop laughing, especially because my wife and I have a running joke similar to this from something she read on USENET.  Pratchett takes it about 10 steps further, though, and he does it with flair.  Pratchett then continues the hilarity, even when he's making some good points on the human condition (like the human ability to do horrible things to each other).  Just when things start to seem a little slow, he'll let loose with another bit of either silliness or wit, such as a Clint Eastwood riff that's simply wonderful.<br />As many people have said already, this is a book about those characters in most other novels who's job it is to die or be bonked on the head at the hands of the hero.  This book celebrates them, gives them a personality and a reason for being other than to be cannon fodder.  This time, instead of being just the downtrodden, they are also the heroes.<br />Vimes is an interesting character, a man who starts out as a man who totally despises what he has become.  He loses himself in drink because, as head of the City Watch, he's nothing.  He gets no respect from anybody (not even his men), and he doesn't have anything to really live for.  In comes Carrot, a &quot;dwarf&quot; (actually, a human who was raised by dwarfs, and still considers himself one, even though he's over 6' tall) who comes to the city actually volunteering to be a member of the watch.  Carrot's a simple man who's devotion to the rule book starts to rub off on Vimes himself.  Between that and the attentions of Sylvia Rimken, the richest woman in the city and somebody who looks past Vimes' outer shell, he starts to become the man of integrity that he's always wanted to be.<br />That all sounds a bit heavy, but it's really not in this book.  Pratchett is a master of making good points underneath all of the jokes, but if you don't want to think about things too much, the laughs are still worth the read.  The other two characters, Colon and Nobs, are good for that.  Colon is the sergeant who has been married for years mainly because of carefully arranges schedules that make it so he and his wife only see each other when they pass at the front door.  Nobs is a very strange man who uses his position to steal things (though Carrot changes that pretty quickly).  Carrot tries to arrest everything in sight, to often hilarious results.  His introduction to the city at one of the local watering holes is simply hilarious.<br />All in all, this is a book that is well worth reading.  As it's the first in the City Watch books, you certainly don't have to have read the previous Discworld books to understand what's going on.  It takes a couple of fantasy cliches and turns them on their head.  You won't be able to look at dragons the same way again after reading it.woman in the city and somebody who looks past Vimes' outer shell, he starts to become the man of integrity that he's always wanted to be.<br />That all sounds a bit heavy, but it's really not in this book.

Dark Progeny is, as the title suggests, a very dark novel, but it is still very well written with intriguing situations and not too many missteps.<br />The Doctor, Anji and Fitz make an emergency landing on Ceres Alpha after the TARDIS suffers a telepathic attack that also seems to be affecting Anji for some reason.  Ceres Alpha is having problems of its own, though.  The developing city-machine is having numerous breakdowns, and a bunch of strange babies with apparent telepathic powers has been born.  What is going on?  What is the connection between the terraforming, the babies and the malfunctions?<br />Steve Emmerson presents the reader with a very interesting situation, one that expands on traditional Doctor Who stories.  The basics of the story could have been told on the TV series, but Emmerson increases the tension and the violence to an extent that would make this book pretty unfilmable.  And isn't that the purpose of the books anyway?  To expand on the series?<br />The Doctor and his companions are put through hell in this book, and they come out all the better for it.  I sometimes shivered at the stuff that they were going through, even as I couldn't wait to read further to find out how they got out of the situation.  The mystery of Ceres Alpha makes you want to read further to find out what is going on.  I do have to say that the ultimate revelation is telegraphed a bit too early (I figured it out about half-way through the book while the Doctor figures it out on page 266).  But it is an interesting one, so I'll forgive it.<br />The characters are well-portrayed for the most part.  This is the Doctor and Anji's book and Fitz is sidelined for most of it.  However, he is given a lot to do even if none of it really has any affect on the outcome of the story.  While he again is very attracted to a female character in the book, at least nothing much is made of it.  That would bother me usually, but since it happens so often and something *is* made of it, it was nice to have Fitz's feelings appear to be unreciprocated.<br />Anji is also very well done, though we don't really learn much about her.  She spends the first portion of the book unconscious, and then spends the rest of the book running, being interrogated, running again, etc.  She plays a very important part in the mystery of the book, however, so what she does go through is important, unlike Fitz.<br />The Doctor shines in this book, though.  His compassion is marvelously portrayed, and he seems a lot more &quot;Doctor-like&quot; in this one than he has been in the past few books.  There are no uncharacteristic violent tendencies that he's had.  Not that this is a bad thing in previous books, but the fact that he seems more normal in this one is a sign that he's settling into his role to an extent.  He's alternately whimsical, tender, and full of righteous outrage which makes him far more recognizable to the fan of the TV series than he has been before.<br />The other characters, Bains, Veta, Josef, Peron (applicable name in this case) and most especially Tyran are also well-portrayed.  Tyran's motivation is very clear and he's not just a villain in order to be a villain.  His background very much colours the way he is now.  Each character has a part to play in the narrative, and none of them are wasted.  Veta and Josef start out as very tragic characters, and I wondered what they would end up having to do with the plot.  The result was very nicely done.<br />This is a good book to recommend to Who fans who have thought the books are too much of a departure from the series.  It's very intense and very violent, so keep that in mind as well.  But its roots are definitely back in the series, with the Doctor fighting bureaucracy and the military for the greater good of a society.y.	2001-12-28

This is a good thing, because Instruments is a tremendous step down from Business (I haven't read Scales).  While Business Unusual was an enjoyable, if not deep, romp, Instruments goes from place to place to place, without much happening at all.  Then, the ending wraps everything up in a 20-page rush to conclusion.<br />Gary spends a lot of time setting up all of the characters (there are a lot of them in this one).  He also spends a lot of time telling what happened to these characters in the first two books, which got a bit annoying.  I haven't read Business in awhile and like I said, I haven't read Scales.  It was nice to get a little context on the characters, but unfortunately this comes in huge infodumps that just grated.  Then, when you add Evelyn, it just makes it worse.  Evelyn is a character from the Big Finish audios that Gary is the producer of.  Now her character needs to be explained for the reader who doesn't listen to the audios.<br />What it all amounts to is a huge number of pages where nothing much happens.  There's a lot of setting, and not much action.  By &quot;action,&quot; I don't mean explosions and chases and such, I mean that nothing happens at all.  I'm all for characterization, but sometimes authors can take that too far.  This is one of those times.  It was almost page 200 (out of 284) before the Doctor really got involved in anything.  That has been BBC Books' problem for quite awhile now, the ineffective Doctor.  In this one, he is instrumental in the resolution, but it takes forever for him to get to that point.<br />I will say that the characterization of Mel and Evelyn is really good.  I have heard one of the audios with her in it, and the character certainly matched.  I could hear Maggie Stables playing this Evelyn.  The Doctor isn't quite so good, but he is passable.  This is a much more restrained Sixth Doctor then we got in the series, but that's a good thing.  He has received a much better characterization in books and audios then he ever got on TV due to BBC politics.<br />Sadly, the rest of the characters don't get that benefit.  Most of them are fairly one-note.  There is one setting and two characters that are presented, and then they disappear until the end of the novel, coming out of nowhere.  The European characters get a bit better, but they still suffer from being flat.<br />The ending brings this waste to an unsatisfying conclusion.  It comes from nowhere, being hurriedly wrapped up after pages and pages of characterization.  After so long being uninvolved, the Doctor suddenly has a good idea of what's happening without much to lead him there.  Mel and Evelyn are sent off on an unbelievable mission that just is there to put them in danger.  The setting and characters I referred to earlier all of a sudden appear, and a character makes the ultimate sacrifice.  Unfortunately, we don't have anything invested in this sacrifice or the character, because we have so little exposure to it.  It just happens this way to prevent the Doctor from having to make that sacrifice.<br />Unless you're a completist, I would recommend you avoid this book.

I had heard great things about Pratchett, though, so I knew this would be a good one. It certainly didn't disappoint, as the book is almost Adams like in its absurdity.  You'll laugh out loud from the first couple of pages.<br />Starting out with a mix-up during the birth of the Anti-Christ, things spiral out of control from there.  Crowley and Aziraphale (a demon and an angel) try to stop armageddon from happening because they like living on Earth too much. Of course, Armageddon is already having trouble starting since the Anti-Christ is nowhere to be found.  Throw in a couple of witch-finders, the descendent of Agnes Nutter (author of The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch), a gang of school children, and many, many more memorable characters, there's a laugh on almost every page.  Even the bit parts are good.<br />Gaiman's mythological humour makes a good combination with Pratchett's absurdity.  Underneath all of the weird situations, you can see Gaiman's knowledge of myth and legend shining through.  The dialogue is great, so much so that the most absurd situations seem very real.  The reactions of the characters, while really strange when you think about them, seem very proper and realistic.<br />I have just finished re-reading it, and I had forgotten just how much enjoyment I got out of this book.  It's a heavy subject (the end of the world), but done with such a humorous touch that it's not a heavy book.  If you've read any of the Discworld books, or Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker books, you'll find the same style of humour in here.  If you like this type of humour (and not everybody does), you will love this book.  It may offend you if you're a fundamentalist, but that's the only worry.<br />And whatever you do, don't leave your cassette tapes in your car too long...I'd hate to have to listen to Britney Spears sing &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; or Pavarotti's &quot;We Are the Champions.&quot;i's &quot;We Are the Champions.&quot;	2001-12-20

I would probably be a little rougher on it if it's original intent had been an adult fantasy, but this book is a wonderful introduction to the fantasy genre.  It's not so deep and involved that it will turn off the young reader who doesn't usually pick up a book, but it is involved enough that it prepares the young reader for the journey into bigger and better things.  If a child has already started reading things like Lord of the Rings (I read it in 3rd grade), then he/she may be a bit bored by the Harry Potter books, but the first one at least is short enough that it probably won't happen that way.<br />Once you've read the first book, and invested some time in the characters, you'll probably be more interested in moving on to the bigger Potter books that are coming up.  I know that's the feeling I have.  I'm very interested in reading the rest of the series.  If young readers have the same feelings (and I know a lot of them do), then the first book has done its job.<br />Another thing this book avoids, which is really refreshing, is talking down to the reader.  I think that may be why so many adults have also fallen in love with this series.  There are some things in it which don't seem very usual for children's books in the States (such as Hagrid being snookered because he had had a little too much to drink), but there's nothing that's inherently harmful in my eyes.  Yet it also allows the adults to enjoy the book without feeling like they're reading a &quot;kid's book.&quot;  I found this book walked a very fine line between being &quot;too much a kid's book&quot; and &quot;too grown-up to be a kid's book,&quot; and it did it exceptionally well.<br />I'm not going to summarize it, because I'm sure it's been done much better eleswhere.  What I will say is that, if you want to get your kids reading, this is a great book to start.  And don't feel too shy about picking up the book and reading it yourself after your kids have gone to bed.is that, if you want to get your kids reading, this is a great book to start.

What I can say about this, though, is that it would be a perfect introduction for a child before going to see the movie.  It has so many stills from the movie, and many of them are exciting.  Especially good are the shots of Hobbiton, the town where Frodo has grown up.  I always wondered how they were going to make a set for the holes that hobbits live in, and there were a few photos that showed me how they look in the movie.  They look *really* good.  There are pictures of all the major characters, pictures of orcs (which many kids will find really neat).  There are a couple pictures of fight sequences.<br />The accompanying text is simple, straightforward, and gives a summary of what the movie will be about.  It mentions that the ring was forged by Sauron, who then lost it in battle and has been trying desperately to find it again.  The forming of the Fellowship is shown with a few other stills from the movie, showing each character.<br />If anything, the photos have whetted my appetite for the movie even more.  I can't wait to go see it.  If you're thinking of taking your children to see the movie (and I'll leave aside for the moment whether or not that's a good idea, because that's an issue in itself), this book would be a great way to get them started.	2001-12-12

Because mediocre movies just aren't that funny.  This is a hilarious book because of a lot of the reviews it contains.  It's a compilation of reviews of movies Ebert gave from zero to two stars.  The low-ranking ones are usually laugh out loud funny.  I read quite a few of them to my wife.  I would start out reading a notable quote, and then realize that it needed context, until finally I just read the entire review.  At times, I had to stop because I was laughing so hard (try out Ebert's review of &quot;Turbulence&quot; for example).<br />Unfortunately for this book, it has too many two star reviews that just aren't that funny.  Ebert does a good job of detailing why it's a mediocre movie, but that certainly can't be the point of this book.  As many reviewers here have pointed out, if all you want is comment on movie-making, Ebert publishes all of his reviews every year.  The point of this book has to be collecting a bunch of negative reviews in order to make the reader laugh.  The reviews of mediocre movies just don't do that.  The value of the book is in the humour, not in the reviews themselves.<br />As for the avoidance of buying the book because of Ebert's yearly guides, I think that misses the point.  If you wanted to look at a bunch of reviews of bad movies, it would be a lot harder to do it in the yearbooks.  You have to look movies up by title in those.  Sure, you can look up movies by rating on Ebert's web site, but that only goes back to 1985, and many of the reviews in this book are before that.  For that reason alone, this is a valuable compilation.<br />Ultimately, you will laugh a lot reading this book, even more so if you've managed to sit through one of the movies Ebert's talking about.  Just skim the two star reviews, though, because they take away from the humour factor.	2001-12-10
US	50332419	R2FU5D3B02BWUF	0671720147	442760647	The Vor Game	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Strength of characters carries through a coincidental plot	The Vor Game is the second book in the &quot;Young Miles&quot; collection, and it is the weaker of the two.  It did manage to win the Hugo though, so it must have something going for it.<br />That something is the characters.  Miles and the rest of them shine off the page.  Miles gets into bad situation after bad situation, but his intelligence and quick thinking manage to get him out of it all the time.  He starts out being assigned to a weather station in the arctic north of Barrayar.  There, his independent streak rears its head again and moves him on to something else.  More misadventures happen until Miles is going all over the sector of space dealing with crisis after crisis, each one usually being caused by his solution to the previous crisis.<br />What makes this the weaker book of the two is the huge number of coincidences that are required to move the plot forward.  Miles gets lucky more than anything else, and some of the people he runs into he only does because the plot requires it.  It's too bad, too, because I think the story would have been very strong even without all of them.  When Miles meets one of the main villains, it strains credulity to the maximum.  The person is somebody from Miles' past who happens to pop up again.  It would have been different if this person would have been directly after Miles, because at least then the person would have a reason to show up.  Unfortunately, that's not the case.<br />That being said, though, there is more great humour, more drama, and more space action to cover all of it the coincidences.  It is a fun book to read, and it is a page-turner.  You'll never be bored, and you'll never want to put it down.  It's certainly worth a read, especially if you're going to be reading the whole series.  It's not necessarily important to, though, as most of the books seem to be pretty self-contained (at least that's the idea I get).<br />If you can deal with the coincidences, then this is a great book to read.  I heartily recommend it.tily recommend it.	2001-12-09

Yes, I know this wasn't the first book in the series, but it is the earliest chronologically in Miles life (not including the pre-Miles books about his parents).  It is, however, my first exposure to this character and this universe after having read so many great things about it on rec.arts.sf.written.  Was it everything it was cracked up to be?<br />It was, and then some.  Miles is such a wonderful character, and Bujold really brings him to life.  He is very flawed, but those flaws (and how he overcomes them) really make him interesting to read about.  He is able to think on his feet and solve problems as they come up.  Inevitably, these solutions  lead to bigger problems, but he is able to solve those, too.<br />After being washed out of the Academy, Miles goes on a &quot;vacation&quot; of sorts to decide what he wants to do with his life.  He is considered by some a &quot;mutant&quot; because of the way he was born.  He has stunted growth and very brittle bones, because of an attack on his mother when he was still in the womb.  These physical ailments are what cause him to be washed out.<br />Miles' big heart starts his troubles, as he goes from encounter to encounter, meeting people and helping them, even though this help leads to even bigger problems.  At the end of all this, he finds himself in charge of a mercenary band and has to figure out 1) how to get himself out of this increasingly hairy situation, but also 2) how his actions have led to political problems for his family at home.  The way Miles handles the situation makes for very entertaining reading.<br />Bujold really mixes comedy, drama, and a bit of tragedy into the book.  She handles the transition very well.  Her characters are all interesting people, with quirks and motivations that make you care about them.  The tone is always light, but there is an undercurrent of tension that makes the book much more than a broad comedy.  You'll laugh at some points, but there are some poignant moments as well.  The &quot;world&quot; that Bujold has created is very intriguing, with lots of backstory colouring the tale without actually intruding.<br />This is a fine introduction to the Miles saga, and I know I will be reading the rest of the books to catch up on them.ll.

US	50332419	R5UOH7NP6QE88	0399146415	965921530	A Gathering of Spies	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A fascinating thriller	I picked this book up after reading Mr. Gingrich's review and then reading the sample pages on Amazon.  While I can't give it the same glowing review that Mr. Gingrich did, I can say that it's a very enjoyable book for its genre and well worth reading.<br />This is a great World War II spy novel that is only let down by the unbelievability of the main protagonist.  Winterbotham is an aging academic, and yet we are supposed to believe he suddenly develops spy skills good enough to join in a manhunt for a German spy who could be anywhere in the British countryside?  I found my suspension of disbelief wearing a bit thin once that happened, and it stretched further after some of his other deeds.<br />That being said, the book is a very enjoyable read, especially if you like spy novels like I do.  Katarina is an intriguing character:  a spy and killer who comes in from the cold when she finds a secret too big for her to keep quiet.  I didn't quite buy her transformation, but everything that led up to it was good.  She's good at what she does, but she's very rusty after ten long years of neglect.  She relatively emotionless (or would like to be, at least) and kills without compunction.  Usually it's a male character who is like this, so it is a refreshing change.<br />Winterbotham too is interesting, once you get past his believability.  He's a man more driven my emotion than duty.  His devotion to his wife is his utmost driving force.  He's willing to risk everything to find her.  We never really find out why this woman deserves such devotion, as Altman never really tells us much about their relationship.  He does mention a few details, but they show more why she would be difficult to live with.  Winterbotham obviously loves her very much, but we don't see why.<br />Despite all this, Altman writes the character so well that you tend to disregard all this when you read about him.  He gives him some academic mannerisms (constantly smoking his pipe), and a cold personality.  While you don't get a good illustration of the love for his wife, you do get to see how it motivates him to do what he does throughout this book.  He's very single-minded and willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve his goal.<br />Altman interweaves real people with his characters to show exactly what's at stake in this game of cat and mouse.  Most of them use the reader's basic knowledge of history to characterize them.  Hitler is a ranting lunatic, Himmler is a visciously thorough man, Goring is a fat ex-soldier who only cares about his artwork, etc.  Still, they establish the setting well enough and do point out just how big this secret is.<br />The best thing about this book, and the reason for the 4 stars, is how engaging it is.  It's a real page-turner that you won't be able to put down.  The action grips you, the characters (with the caveats above) make you care what happens to them, and there's a sense of unpredictability about everything.  You're not really sure how it's going to end until it actually happens.  I like that in a book, and I would certainly recommend reading it.While you don't get a good illustration of the love for his wife, you do get to see how it motivates him to do what he does throughout this book.

US	50332419	R1QUOV0CCDMZCK	0345397665	106893307	Antrax (Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, Book 2)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Better than the first, but let's see how he ends it	Antrax is the typically brisk read that Brooks usually provides.  There's nothing extremely deep in his books, but they usually make very good light adventure reading.  This one certainly adds to that reputation.<br />The first book in this series, The Ilse Witch, suffered from a very disjointed narrative that had no pacing whatsoever.  It covered months and months of time, started out very slowly, then raced past the acquisition of the keys until it skidded to a halt with  a cliff-hanger ending.  Antrax, on the other hand, only covers a week or so and is all the better for it.  Brooks limits himself to five groups of people for point of view, which makes the book seem a lot more tight and contained.  I still have a little trouble with some of his pacing, and the order in which he presents certain scenes (he has a scene with the elven prince and the seer right before a scene with Walker; the first scene totally ruins the twist at the end of the Walker scene).  Overall, though, it felt a lot better to read.<br />The main problem with the book is that, for a long period of time, nothing seems to happen.  Brooks has his characters constantly thinking about the situation they're in, sometimes using quite a few pages for their thoughts before they actually do something.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it gets very repetitious when the same characters are doing that, mulling over thoughts that they've already had and the reader has already read.<br />As for the plot of the book, it is getting quite good.  Shannara has always lent itself to the technology vs magic plot idea, given how many references have been made to &quot;the old time&quot; in the previous series.  I've always wondered what happened back then, and was hoping to find that out.  It's a bit disappointing not to, but that wouldn't be fair to the book, criticizing it for something I'd like to see, rather than criticizing it for what it contains.  There are still enough fascinating hints about the past to intrigue the reader.<br />When the characters stop thinking for a few moments, there is plenty of action.  I could have done without all of the descriptions of druid fire blowing everything up and creepers falling to pieces (the description got very repetitious), but the rest of the action is produced very nicely by Brooks.  I've never had a problem with his writing in this aspect, which may be why all of his previous Shannara books have had wars in the background. He writes action a lot better than he writes moving character scenes.<br />Finally, I have to give Brooks credit for the ending, compared to the Ilse Witch.  I'm still a bit annoyed that these books are ending in cliffhangers for the next books, but that's mostly because Brooks' earlier Shannara series never really did that before.  However, there is no comparison between the ending of Ilse Witch and Antrax.  The Ilse Witch raced to its conclusion and then came to a crashing halt.  Antrax's ending felt very appropriate.  The story eased its way up to it, and settled.  I didn't feel like I'd run into a brick wall.  I appreciated that.<br />Unless you're a big Brooks fan, I don't know if I can recommend that you buy this series.

It didn't sound very interesting compared to the previous books in the Benjamin January series.  It actually took this book awhile to get going.<br />However, when it does, it really cooks.  What sounds like a boring opera story develops into international intrigue, more slavery issues and crimes that happened in the past.  You'd think that this would make the book be a little disjointed, but Hambly brings it all together marvelously.  There are so many twists and turns in this one, it almost gives you whiplash (but in a good way).<br />Hambly, as always, is great with the New Orleans atmosphere.  She has increased it from what was in the fourth book, though she's still not up to the third book's standards where this is concerned.  However, I didn't notice it as much, because the book itself was so intriguing.<br />Not only that, but there is actual movement in a lot of the relationships between the characters.  There are changes in Ben &amp; Rose's relationship, Dominique, even Hannibal a little bit.  You get to know a little bit more about the past, both January's and Hannibal's.  January's time spent in Paris actually is relevant for once, rather than just background information.<br />This one took me a bit longer to read because of the slow start.  However, it is definitely worth every moment spent on it.  The payoff is great, and you will soon find yourself praising Hambly again.  I can't wait for Wet Grave to come out.	2001-11-22

Perhaps it's because everything is so intricately detailed?  I don't know, but I do know that it's going to be very hard to wait until August, 2002 to read the next book in this series.  It is a truly wonderful series, and this book continues that tradition, ratcheting up the suspense and the intrigue to a level that's almost hard to take.<br />In this series, there are no *true* heroes.  Everybody's flawed in some ways, they do nasty things to their enemies.  They even sometimes, out of necessity, do nasty things to their friends.  Even the truly evil characters end up having some redeeming characteristics.  It doesn't make them any less likable, but it does make them a lot more human.<br />The characters are spread all over the world, even more so in this book then in the previous ones.  There are so many plotlines to follow that it can sometimes be confusing.  But if you work at it a little bit, it's not that hard.  Each chapter is told in a different character's point of view.  Some characters never have their view told, and we only see them through the eyes of others.  We never see Robb's point of view, but we see him through Catelyn's eyes, for example.<br />In this book, we get our first look at Jaime Lannister.  Through the first two books, he appears mostly as a scumbag.  But Martin shows that he does have a sense of honour, even though it is a bit warped.  It provided a very interesting contrast from the first two books.<br />Another hallmark of this series is that you can never tell what's going to happen.  Just because a character is one of the &quot;main&quot; characters, doesn't mean that character will survive the book.  Martin has no qualms about killing off his major characters.  It makes a refreshing change.<br />Finally, throughout the first three books, magic of a sorts is slowly making its way back into the world.  The series starts out as more medieval then fantasy, but it's going to be moving a bit more toward the fantastic.<br />This series (and this book) is the perfect cure for the person who thinks that fantasy has become old hat.  Do yourself a favour and pick it up.  Martin has promised it will only be 6 books, so you don't even need to worry about that like you do about Robert Jordan.and this book) is the perfect cure for the person who thinks that fantasy has become old hat.

I greatly enjoyed the first three (as my review of Graveyard Dust details), but could Hambly hit another one out of park?<br />Let's call it a triple.  It's not quite as good as the other ones, but it's still worth 5 stars.  It is a very good novel about slavery and the effects of slavery on black individuals.  Hambly portrays this very well by forcing Ben back onto the plantation, this time to find out who's trying to mess up his former master's plantation.  Could it be one of the slaves, doing it despite what would happen to the other slaves if Simon Fourchet dies?  Or is there a something else going on?<br />The plotting on this one is not quite as dense, which is a good thing.  But Hambly also doesn't quite paint the atmosphere as well as she has in the previous books.  Sure, you really do see the horrors that the slaves had to endure, and she does paint those scenes very well.  The descriptions are well done as well.  You really feel like you're in a sugar cane field, or in the heat of the mill, or whatever.  However, there are fewer descriptive asides in this one, which I always found to really add to the atmosphere of the books.  I loved it when she would describe life in New Orleans as Ben &amp; Rose are walking the streets.  These descriptions would rarely have anything to do with the plot, but they immersed me in the novel and the world, taking me back to New Orleans of the 1830s.<br />That being said, the rest of the book is a standout.  The mystery is very intriguing.  It doesn't have quite as many twists and turns as the previous books, but it still has some surprises left.  I was going to criticize it for having another chase similar to Fever Season (or was it the first one? I can't quite remember).  However, this scene bears fruits that make it not only different from the previous one, but also essential to the story.<br />Well done, Barbara.

It wasn't necessarily intentional, but I just never got around to picking up the next books.<br />I finally rectified that by taking the next three out of the library recently.  Graveyard Dust, the first of those, is another great book in the series.  The plot is very intriguing, taking many twists and turns before coming to a resolution that is logical, even if you didn't see it coming.<br />The writing is very dense.  Hambly is not one for those light novels that you can breeze through, skipping whole passages because they don't have anything to do with anything.  To get full value out of this book, you have to read everything.  There were times I had to re-read passages to figure out where January came to one of his conclusions.  It was there, I had just missed it.<br />Hambly also handles atmosphere beautifully.  So many passages of description set the mood of New Orleans.  Some say that she does too much of it, but I love atmosphere in a novel.  It can be overdone when written badly, but Hambly does it well here, never making it boring.  She really sets the tone of the city, making it beautiful and horrible all at the same time.  She doesn't shy away from anything.  The society is so well-drawn, with all the relationships between various factions within the society.<br />I haven't really talked about the mystery much.  It is very intriguing, taking off in a couple directions that I didn't predict.  The front cover is definitely true when it says &quot;a novel of suspense.&quot;  Who is trying to prevent Ben from finding out what really happened and clearing his sister from murder charges?  Who really did it?  And, ever-present in a novel about the south before the Civil War, will Ben be able to find anything out in a society where blacks are treated like chattel?<br />I'm glad I decided to come back to this series.  I love Hambly's fantasy stories, and I'm glad that she's got another two ready for publication next year, but I also treasure this series as well.ad that she's got another two ready for publication next year, but I also treasure this series as well.	2001-11-09

There's something about spy novels that take place during this time period, as well as books that have to do with Special Forces missions.<br />This book is about a serial killer who is doing his killings during the London Blitz of 1940. This has security as well as strategic implications when it's figured out that the killer is doing the killing in areas the night the murder location is bombed by the Germans. Because of this, both a German and an American spy get involved along with Morris Black, a Scotland Yard inspector who gets in over his head.<br />I really liked this book, and found it very hard to put down. The descriptions of London during the Blitz are really well done, so much so that even if you've never been to Britain, you can still picture where the action is happening. Hyde really makes you understand the horror of living under this intense bombing.<br />His descriptions of the more personal horrors sometimes go a little over the top, but it isn't that much of a problem. There were a couple of times that i skipped over a passage when he went on and on describing the condition of a dead body. That doesn't happen too often, however.<br />The characters are well-portrayed as well. You really get a sense of the conflicting loyalties that some of them face. Black is an Inspector who doesn't want anything to do with politics and international intrigue, but he's drawn in anyway. It's very interesting to see how he reacts to it all. Katherine's dilemma is also intriguing. None of the characters are typical: they all have their own motivations that are well-portrayed.<br />I did object a bit to the way one of the characters is written out rather arbitrarily. It seemed to me that the character was leading somewhere, and then *boom* the character is dead. Not quite what I was expecting, which can often be a good thing. However, in this case, it seemed to be a waste.<br />All in all, though, it's a great book. If you like this sort of book (historical suspense novel, spies, etc), you will love this one.

It has never shown up at the usual place I buy Doctor Who books, so I finally broke down and bought it when I was in the States.<br />Given everything I had heard about the book, I had really low expectations going in.  Given those expectations, I actually enjoyed it quite a lot.  It's nowhere near classic Who, and there are a lot of problems with it, but I did end up finding it worth my time.<br />The thing that did it for me was the characterization of Fitz.  I've had the benefit of reading a lot of Post-Earth-Arc books with Fitz in them, so perhaps that coloured my view a little.  Anyway, Fitz is extremely well done in this one.  For awhile, I really found the constant &quot;womanizing&quot;  of Fitz extremely annoying.  Every time he looked at Tarra, Romana or any of the other women characters, he was constantly thinking of how they looked, how he would follow those legs anywhere, etc.  It got on my nerves.<br />However, as the book wore on, I started to realize something.  This was Fitz's coping mechanism because he's scared spitless throughout the book.  The events are too much for one human to handle, and he's taking refuge in what he's always done:  going after the ladies.  It also sets him up for a horrific revelation later on in the book involving one of those women, which might not have been as powerful if it hadn't been set up by Fitz ogling her earlier in the book.<br />The other really good character is somebody who's &quot;related&quot; to Fitz.  I really ended up caring what happened to him, and his sense of betrayal.  I thought he was going to be a stock character, but he turned out not to be.  Unfortunately, I can't go into any more detail without spoilers.  You'll know who I'm talking about when you read it, though.<br />The Doctor is also well-characterized, but he's not really anything special.  He does Doctorly things, he has to make a  momentous decision that can have drastic consequences.  He's able to make that decision because of the direction the Eighth Doctor books was going to be changing, so at least it's not a reset-button issue.<br />The Faction Paradox come across as run of the mill villains in this book, which is a shame after the set-up Lawrence Miles gave them.  In this book, they're more of a &quot;Nothing can stop me now!!!!&quot; sort of villain.  I swear I could almost see one of them twirling a moustache at times.  It really let the book down, I think.<br />It's too bad Miles couldn't finish the story that he started.  I'm not a big fan of his, and it may have been just as bland, but it would have been nice to see what Miles would have done with his creations.  Instead, we get a stock story that really doesn't go anywhere and the only reason it goes as far as it does is due to editorial fiat.<br />Too bad, but it's still an enjoyable read.

Nobody will ever confuse it with literature, but if you want a fun read, this is it.<br />The Sixth Doctor meets up with the Brigadier, and hijinks ensue.  Since the Sixth Doctor has already met the Brigadier in the book series (in one of Gary Russell's books), there is no need to have yet another initial meeting between the two. Instead, Justin and Stephen can get on with the story.<br />And what a story it is.  Did Hitler survive the events of the bunker at the end of the war?  What's going on in that strange house?  Why has an entire English village been cordoned off since World War II?  All of these mysteries come together in a delightful fashion.<br />Colin Baker *is* the Sixth Doctor in this book.  I could see him perfectly in this part.  The Brigadier is perfect as the wise old soldier who's still got the will to go on an adventure even though his body may not agree.  The &quot;companion&quot; role is taken by a television reporter who is also well characterized.  She's got a nose for a mystery, and it shows.  What happens to her in this story actually surprised me, though it was almost poetic when I thought about it afterward.  It's something that Cole and Richards couldn't do if they had been forced to use a real companion from the series.<br />There's also a wonderful use of continuity in this book.  I love continuity as long as it's used well (for an example of how not to use it, see The Quantum Archangel).  This book references both the series, a previous BBC book and also a previous Virgin book, which surprised me a bit.<br />This book is a lot of fun.  Don't expect anything truly deep and meaningful out of it, but it's a nice, straightforward adventure that will make you smile.	2001-10-23

In a spare moment, I picked it up and started reading it.  I finished the first two chapters and thought &quot;Wow, what an interesting idea!  I have to read this book.&quot;  I asked him if I could borrow it when he finished.<br />I have now finished it myself, and I have to say that the intriguing premise has been wasted by some very pedestrian writing.  The idea of a mysterious stranger creating a game and having a woman do increasingly dangerous things to get more and more money is nice.  The mystery builds nicely.  Who is this stranger, and what does he want with Jane?  Could the stranger actually be Brace, the young man that Jane meets while doing the first task?<br />The whole story is gutted, though, by the writing.  The constant waffling by the Jane character, while very possibly true to life, really got annoying to read after awhile.  Internal monologues that read similar to &quot;He's a typical man.....I love him.... he's scum...he's wonderful...is he really who he says he is...I don't care.....&quot; really got on my nerves after awhile.<br />Then there is the sexual aspect of the writing.  It is extremely juvenile.  I don't object to sexual content in books that I read, but this got a bit ridiculous.  There are constant references to Jane's underwear and how it sticks to her when she sweats, references to her breasts that come out of nowhere, and things like that.  I realize that Laymon is trying to add a sexual atmosphere to the book, considering what the villain is like.  But most of the time it seems very out of place.  It doesn't add to the atmosphere at all, but instead rips you out of the book in order to notice the words.<br />Also, there are no explanations given for the Master of Games' (the villain's name) ability to come and go at will without disturbing anybody.  Some people may be comfortable with this level of ambiguity, but it left me cold.  This book did not have any supernatural elements in it, basing itself in real life ugliness.  I liked that, but MoG's skill at sneaking just seemed too superhuman, and took away from the &quot;realistic&quot; feel of the book.<br />There is some nice tension in the climax of the book, but the tension doesn't escalate like the cover blurb promises.  MoG doesn't push Jane to do increasingly illegal and immoral things, forcing her to make choice after choice.  Instead, once it gets to a certain point, the novel turns into a chase book.  There's nothing really  that horrifying in this book, with the exception of one sequence which will be obvious once the reader gets there (and if you want to know what it is but don't want to read the book, let me know and I'll tell you).<br />I raced through this book in a little over a day.  It captures your attention and keeps it, but sometimes for the wrong reasons.  It's a fast book to read, whether that's due to the language or the to the plot, I don't know.  It certainly didn't seem like it had 503 pages of plot.<br />For the premise and the quickness, I'll give it 3 stars...probably would be 2.5 if it were allowed.any supernatural elements in it, basing itself in real life ugliness.

It's a good thing I did it that way, because I don't think I would have been as pleasantly disposed to it if I had paid for it.  There are some books that you enjoy for what they are, but you might feel you wasted your money if you had bought them, and this is one of them.<br />The book is an exciting read, for the most part. The characters, while not drawn very 3-dimensionally, are kind of fun.  There is no real stand-out, though.  All of them are of a type, rather than fleshed out.  However, the action is fast and furious, with not a lot of let-up.<br />My main problem with this book is that everything is too easy.  There really isn't a whole lot of tension involved.  There is a little bit in the climactic battle, but even that has a foregone conclusion that doesn't surprise the reader.  The characters go through the motions for the most part.  They are very intense in their feelings and speech, but they appear almost to know that they're in a book and not much will happen to them.<br />The intensity mentioned above adds to another problem.  The characters almost seem to be mouthpieces for Flint's opinions.  Yes, Eric, we get the picture that unions are wonderful and the &quot;bosses&quot; are scum.  Thank you.  We don't need it drilled into our heads.  Because of things like this, the dialogue (and sometimes the narration) seems stilted at times.<br />The historical detail is very good, but some of it comes in huge infodumps that aren't that interesting.  I don't know enough about the time period to know whether Flint's off on his history or not, but it certainly doesn't appear so.<br />I like alternate history novels, even more so when it's something coming from the future to affect the history (Turtledove's &quot;Guns of the South&quot; is a masterpiece of the genre).  I think that's why I enjoyed this novel more than my review says.  It's a page-turner, that's for sure.  Just turn your brain off before starting it.ure.

US	50332419	R63JBDFVGET1C	0563538295	652651673	Vanishing Point (Doctor Who)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Examination of God or an adventure story?	Vanishing Point is a novel that's hard to pin down.  It starts out as a very nice examination of religion and how people relate to it.  There is the crisis of faith as seen from both the layman's side and the clergy's side.<br />It then becomes a study on genetic engineering, though that part is not very deep.  The issue gets glossed over and replaced with a &quot;should we experiment on people who don't know they're the subjects of experiments?&quot; book.<br />Finally, it becomes an action/adventure story.  This is where the book fails, I think.  There is a place in this world for books that examine hard issues.  There is a place for adventure stories.  They can sometimes even coexist.  However, in this novel, the reader gets a bit of whiplash as it moves from one to the other.<br />That being said, I did find this novel quite interesting, and one of Steve Cole's best.  While he doesn't write a theological text, the issues are brought up very well by the supporting characters who inhabit the novel.  I particularly enjoyed the &quot;monk&quot; character (who's name I can't remember and the book is at home).  What does a clergyman do when he begins to doubt?  The conflict is well-established and his final decision, while inevitable, is still gut-wrenching.<br />The ending, though, is a disappointment.  While I was on the edge of my seat wondering exactly how the Doctor was going to fix everything, I don't think it necessarily fit with the rest of the book.  Year of Intelligent Tigers is a good example of how to do a &quot;heavy&quot; book that still has good adventure elements.  In Vanishing Point, it falls a little flat.<br />It is still well worth a read, though.	2001-09-06
US	50332419	R36BNIS64UYSAC	0563538260	613013398	Rags (Doctor Who)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not my cup of tea	This is a very difficult review to write.  I can see that the book is well written.  The idea of an alien feeding on the social rage inside a society is actually rather interesting.  The Doctor, while not really doing a lot in the book, is instrumental in the resolution, so there isn't even that complaint to make against it.<br />This book just was not enjoyable to me, and it wasn't interesting enough to overcome that.  It's Dr. Who meets Punk Rock on acid.  It's a very violent book, and it doesn't pull any punches in the description of said violence.  It's almost over the top in that aspect.  It certainly didn't offend me, but it did become a bit old-hat and stopped affecting me.  I remember in a review of Showgirls, Roger Ebert (or maybe it was Siskel) said that there were so many naked breasts in it that, after a time, you stopped even noticing them.  It was much the same way with the violence in this novel.  Page after page is filled with it.  It gets the point across, but it was just a little too much for me.<br />The Doctor is characterized pretty well, but I had a little problem with Jo.  She seemed even more secondary than usual, existing only to be taken over by the entity.  She didn't really add much to the plot.  I know that happens often in televised Who, but it shouldn't in the books.<br />The book *is* well-written, though.  It is certainly a horror novel, and if you're into that sort of thing, you will probably like it.  Personally, I didn't like it and found it a real struggle to get through.  But I can see the book underneath, and thus have to give it 3 stars.  For me, personally, it's a 1 or 2 star book.  If you really like horror, or you really like reading about rage and violence, it could easily be a 5 star book.  So let's settle for 3.	2001-09-06

It has an interesting &quot;monster,&quot; nice interplay between the Doctor and Peri (a pairing that I'd like to see more of), and an interesting concept.<br />Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be much point to the whole thing.  It's a very violent novel, but there doesn't seem to be much of a reason for that, other than to show bloody violence.  The Velethske are an interesting race, but they deserved a better book.  The &quot;Superior Beings&quot; of the title originally seems to be referring to the Eknuri, but then they turn out to be nothing much of interest.  Then it turns out that it might be referring to something else (no spoilers), but that turns out to be anti-climactic.<br />The main story doesn't even seem to begin for at least 150 pages, if not longer.  The prelude to this main story does nothing except establish how vicious the Velthske are.  Humans and humanoids are nothing but prey to them.  Fine, Nick, we got the point after the first 10 iterations of it.  Could we move on now?  Thank you.<br />I do have to say that the Doctor and Peri are characterized very well, though.  I saw a review somewhere that said that anybody who has watched Caves of Androzani would not recognize these characters.  I don't quite agree.  Yes, Peri is a bit whiney, but she was in Planet of Fire, too.  Even in Caves she was.  Here, she does whine a little bit, but she's also strong, carrying on when a lot of weaker people would have just given up.<br />Peri's jealousy of Aline is well-portrayed.  Here is a girl who has just joined up with the Doctor (you get the idea that this book takes place shortly after Planet of Fire), who's still new to this adventuring thing and has only the Doctor as a lifeline to any kind of normalcy.  It's only natural that she would be jealous of Aline moving in on this.  I found it completely understandable.<br />One other bad thing about this book, though, is the Doctor's almost complete ineffectiveness.  He really doesn't have anything to do with the resolution.  The only thing he does do is make sure that Peri stays alive (and he doesn't even do that, in the end...it's someone else).  Why do the BBC books continually have a Doctor who doesn't do anything?  Isn't he supposed to be the hero of the book?<br />I don't think you'll regret reading it, but only if you're a Fifth Doctor fan.  Dominion, Walters' first novel, was decent.  His second, Fall of Yquitane, was wonderful.  And then there's this.  Is there such a thing as Junior Jinx?eness.  He really doesn't have anything to do with the resolution.

When you pick up a Kate Orman book, you know you're going to get an interesting read, even if you don't necessarily like the book. Kate's last book, Unnatural History (with her husband, Jon Blum), was a book that seemed to be written with a fannish agenda in mind. It really brought down what was an otherwise enjoyable story. This one goes back to the Orman staple of examining characters, especially that of the Doctor.<br />It's no secret that Kate really likes the Eighth Doctor, and you can always tell that when you read one of her books. He comes alive on the page. It has often been said that the Eighth Doctor doesn't seem to have much character, but that's never true in one of Kate's books. It's so nice that the Doctor actually does something, rather than being a bystander as he has been in many Eighth Doctor books.<br />This book also continues the storyline of Anji's doubting of the Doctor. Things are going from bad to worse there. For the first time, he appears to side with the aliens against the humans. He's not just being callous anymore, he appears to have gone to the other side. When one of the humans is killed and the Doctor just steps over them without even batting an eyelash, Anji doesn't know what to think. Again, Anji has nothing to compare this to, unlike Fitz. Fitz tries really hard to run interference for the Doctor, knowing that the Doctor couldn't betray them. Could he?<br />Fitz's dilemma is moving. He's torn between love for the Doctor and uncertainty about what's going to happen. He's just a plain, simple guy trying to do the right thing, even though he sometimes doesn't know what that is. You really have to feel for him sometimes, especially in this book. He's trying to delay the humans because the Doctor must have a plan. He just hasn't told them what it is. He's the only one of the humans that trusts the Doctor anymore, and he feels quite alone.<br />The tigers also make interesting characters. I found myself really growing attached to Longbody, Bounce, and even Big a little bit. Orman gives them all distinct personalities, motivations, and character. Longbody is distrustful, Bounce is an idealistic child, and Big is a pragmatic leader who has to handle not only the humans, but dissension within his own ranks.<br />The novel itself has an interesting feel to it. There is action in it, and violence. Yet it doesn't feel like there's a lot in there. The pace is a lot more leisurely than Eater of Wasps (the previous Eighth Doctor book). For the first time, the TARDIS crew is taking a holiday, and the book takes on that feel. Even when the Tigers plan is revealed, the pace is leisurely, almost like a sociological study of two societies than an adventure book. Yet it's still good.<br />Orman makes both societies interesting and worthy of the time spent on them. Even when the action starts, it's a lot slower than most Who books. The ending came as a surprise as well. I won't spoil it here, but let's just say that the Doctor comes up with an un-Doctorly solution, but yet it doesn't seem out of character. Everything that's happened in this book leads up to it, and it works.<br />If you're a Who fan, give yourself a treat and read this book. Let a non-Who fan borrow it, it may just draw them in. It's not a non-stop roller-coaster ride, but actually requires a little thought and paying attention. But that's ok. It's worth it..

It shows throughout this book. It makes Oxford an interesting place, and somewhere you'd love to visit (or, in this case, study). He's got the latent, and sometimes overt, anti-semitism down, the politics between the church and the government , and lots of other historical detail.<br />Shame about the story, though. If this had been a history book, it would have been great. However, this is supposed to be an exciting Dr. Who adventure, and it falls a bit flat when it tries to fulfill that purpose. There is little mystery in the Name of the Rose style plot. The Doctor is generic, with even few of the mannerisms of the Fourth Doctor. That's surprising, because usually an author's generic Doctors have *only* the cliched mannerisms of the Doctor they're trying to portray.<br />The worst part about this book, though, is Nyssa. There is little point in having her meet the Doctor before he has officially met her in his timeline. Not much is made of that at all. There is no special relationship between the Doctor and her which would require this odd bending of the timestreams, and nothing comes out of it. It is nothing but an excuse to do a character study on Nyssa. Why couldn't Darvill-Evans have had the Sixth Doctor meet her? It would have had the same effect on the narrative. And raise your hand if you buy the &quot;I'll remember to forget you&quot; hand-wave to &quot;explain&quot; why the Doctor doesn't just say &quot;Why hello, Nyssa, haven't seen you since the 13th century&quot; when he lands on Traken.<br />The pathetic introduction of Nyssa is also disappointing. Darvill-Evans must have been reading some of the talk on the Net about how some fans fantasize about her. That's the only excuse I can think of for Nyssa's opening scene, where the author really emphasizes that Nyssa is naked throughout it, or swimming.<br />Then, when she gets to 13th Century England, she doesn't do anything! She sits in isolation, trying hard to remove herself from the world, until forced to do something at the end (how convenient). It may have made an interesting character study if: 1) it hadn't been written so tediously; and 2) it hadn't been meshed very badly with a murder mystery plot. In capable hands, the character study may even have been captivating. That being said, my image of Nyssa says to me that she would never reach this point of despondency to begin with. She is a strong character, who volunteered to stay among the futuristic version of lepers to help them find a cure for the disease, even though she may catch the disease as well. I can see her needing a break, especially after all of the stuff that Darvill-Evans describes that she's gone through. What I can't see is her attempted total withdrawal from everything. It just doesn't suit her.<br />The shortness of the book only demonstrates more that something more needed to be done. There's so much lavish description of Oxford showing off the author's research, that it's obvious if he'd taken any of that out, the book would have been too short for publication.<br />In short, read it if you have any historical interest in England or in Oxford specifically. If you're a fan of the 4th Doctor or Nyssa, stay away. No matter what the cover says, you won't find them in here. 2 stars for the historical detail, and that's it.

The Janus Conjunction was rather dull and Coldheart was just plain bad.<br />Eater of Wasps, however, was *very* good.  I do not like wasps, and thus this book really creeped me out. Baxendale's descriptions of wasp attacks were well done.  Every time he did it, I had to suppress a shudder.  The supporting characters, while cliched, were interesting personalities.  There were a couple of surprises in them, as well.  There are secrets amongst the populace:  some of them obvious, but one that is very well hidden until near the end.<br />The regulars are well characterized also.  The growing distrust between Anji and the Doctor should lead to an interesting conclusion sometime further along in the series. Anji's still new at all this, and the Doctor is not acting like the Doctor we all know.  He's erratic (more so than usual), sometimes violent (which is *very* unusual) and sometimes very dismissive of humans (who are his favourite species).  For Fitz, this is just something to endure while hoping he can help snap the Doctor out of it.  For Anji, this is all she knows, and she doesn't like it.  She can't understand Fitz's apparent blind trust in the Doctor.  Sometimes, he doesn't appear to be deserving of it.<br />This is a book that should satisfy both traditional fans, and fans of &quot;New Who&quot; that want a little more from their Who books.  It's a traditional story that's set in a radical setting.<br />I hope Trevor can keep this up for his next book.	2001-08-22
US	50332419	R222FN8I5MTVNO	0380977249	211102990	Fury: A Novel	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A nice break	I have loved G.M. Ford's Leo Waterman books since my mother-in-law lent me Cast in Stone.  Ford just has such a sense of place and style.  I lived in the Seattle area for a year, and his books make me nostalgic for it.<br />Anyway, on to Fury.  It's a nice break from the Waterman books, which I could sense Ford was running out of steam on.  Leo makes a nice cameo that updates his fans on how he's doing since the *SPOILER for Deader the Better* break up with Rebecca *END SPOILER*<br />But other than that cameo, it's all about Frank Corso.  Ford does a great job with this character.  He's a recluse, a little bit eccentric, but still with a heart of gold.  There's also an unlikely romance that I hope gets explored in subsequent books.<br />Dougherty is also intriguing, with an interesting backstory as well. I find it interesting that Ford created this character and makes her slightly more than a secondary character (though the book is still Corso's).  I read in January magazine that he's had trouble writing female characters.  Dougherty, though, is interesting, and I look forward to getting to know her better.<br />The mystery itself is well-done, with nice twists, especially the ending.  I didn't see that coming, and was wondering how Ford was going to resolve everything.  It's light, fluffy reading.  Perfect for a rainy day (as Seattle has many of) or a day at the beach.  It won't tax your brain, but it will engage your interest.  Isn't that what mysteries are for?	2001-08-21
US	50332419	R18OAECVXZFWXE	0886778581	174499108	Green Rider	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Not bad for a beginner	I picked this book up on a whim when I was spending a gift certificate that a friend had given me.  Perhaps that's why I'm better disposed to it than I would think I would be.<br />It's not a particularly bad book.  I was entertained by it, it went by quickly, and there were no glaring errors in characterization or plot.  I didn't throw it across the room in disgust.  I suppose that's a plus.<br />Basically, the book has a &quot;been there, done that&quot; feel to it.  Name a fantasy trope, and this book contains it.  Magic from long ago coming back into the world.  A hero (or, in this case, heroine) who starts out as a nobody, who gets drawn into world-shattering events against her will, and yet is able to persevere against all the odds.<br />What really annoyed me about the book is how little Karigan actually does for herself until late in the book.  Time after time, she is saved by one thing or another (I can't go into detail without providing spoilers).  At times, it shows her strength that she is able to keep going in each situation, but the ultimate solution always seems to come from outside of her.  It got on my nerves.  Only late in the book does she start doing things on her own.<br />If you can find this book in a library and the plot description sounds interesting to you, I'd say go ahead and get it.  It's not really a waste of time.  However, I would say it's money that could be better spent elsewhere if you are going to buy it.  It is an excessively average book, which is why it gets 3 starts.  Probably would be 2.5 stars if we could give half stars.	2001-08-19
US	50332419	R16XVK2BYEKS0Z	0521443172	428237087	A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Everything you would want to know about World War II	I used to consider myself very knowledgable about World War II.  I still do, but how much I didn't know was reinforced by reading this book.<br />World at Arms contains almost everything you would want to know about the political and strategic situations of the war.  It starts out with the underlying reasons for the war and goes on to cover the wide variety of situations in great detail. You won't find much on individual battles, but the book gives you great understanding in *why* those battles happened.<br />What I found most interesting was how it covered all the interactions between nations.  Never before had I seen such  comprehensive information on how Germany and Japan related to each other.  Most of the books I had read have covered one theater or the other, without really going into how one theater affected another.<br />At 900+ pages, the book is not something that you will read while lying in bed (maybe sitting up in bed, but not lying in it). However, if you have any interest in World War II, especially the stories behind the war, this is the book for you.	2001-08-15
US	50332419	R1I743GQE0BM1U	0563538031	367245922	Festival of Death (Doctor Who Series)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Captures the feel of the series	This is one of the best of the BBC Doctor Who books.  It's hard to believe that Jonathan Morris is a first time writer.  Are we sure he's never published under another name?<br />All of the different timelines in the book are handled beautifully, apparently without any seams.  I know I didn't find any contradictions, any places where I went &quot;Wait a minute, that's not right.&quot;  I can only imagine how complicated this must have been for Morris, but he's done a wonderful job here.<br />The characterizations of the regulars are spot on as well.  I could hear Tom Baker and Lalla Ward with almost every sentence.  The supporting characters weren't quite as well-delivered, but that's to be expected in such a plot-heavy book.<br />I sincerely hope that Morris writes another one soon.	2001-08-15
US	50332419	R29HYFL1MOLRLP	0563538244	784535501	Quantum Archangel (Doctor Who)	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Fanwank incarnate	I really enjoyed Hinton's previous Who books, but this one was just a bit too much.  While it was said before the book was published that Justin Richards had encouraged him to use as much as possible, I went into fanwank overload while reading this book.<br />The continuity references come fast and furious, swamping the reader.  I enjoy continuity references as long as their done lightly, a sauce to add flavour to the book.  In Quantum Archangel, you can taste nothing but the sauce.<br />It was also too cosmic for my tastes.  Hinton tries really hard to ground the narrative and make it personal, but he doesn't succeed enough.  The technobabble starts to invade, and the book is lost.  The ideas and concepts are too big and overwhelm the characters.<br />I also don't like the Sixth Doctor.  Too many times, he is a generic Doctor with Sixth Doctor mannerisms grafted on.  Too many times, the Doctor repeats his words in an annoyed manner.<br />To say something good, Mel was well characterized and I enjoyed the Master's part in all of this.<br />I can't wait for Craig's next book.  Hopefully it will be more down to earth.	2001-08-15
US	50332419	R1CSMQAXXZ3CJ2	0345396545	798168467	Ilse Witch (The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, Book 1)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	More of the same	I've enjoyed most of Terry Brooks Shannara books, and I did enjoy this one too.  It was fast-paced and I also read it fairly quickly.<br />Unfortunately, the reason for the quickness is that most of it has been done by Brooks before.  It's a rehash of the entire series, with characters given new names.  There's the tough, strong highlander, the mysterious druid (though I did like how Walker kept trying really hard not to be like Allanon, but rarely succeeded), a Shannara descendent, etc.<br />The other annoying part was how the book just ended without any sort of resolution whatsoever.  In the past, Brooks has been really good at bringing each book to a close, even as he left room for the next book.  This time, the entire book is a set up for the next one.  When he glossed over the retrieval of the keys, I thought it was going to be a rushed book.  Instead, it turns into a very uneven book, as Brooks rushes from action to action, and then abrubptly stops as the book ends.<br />All of these words have been negative so far, but I did ultimately enjoy the book.  I think I'm nostalgic for the world (it's been awhile since I've read the previous books) and I like the characters.  I just wish they'd been a bit different.	2001-08-15
US	50332419	R2XY2X9UV70J5R	0563538252	792879067	Escape Velocity (Doctor Who)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not bad, but not that great	Colin Brake's first Doctor Who novel is not a resounding success. The prose is a bit laboured, the Doctor's first meeting with Fitz in 100 years (as far as the Doctor is concerned) is rather anticlimactic and the characters are rather wooden.<br />The reason this book gets three stars, though, is Anji. Her character is a breath of fresh air after the companionless books that have just passed. Brake goes into a lot of detail about her and we really get to know her. Her relationship with her boyfriend is real (I've known people like him).<br />Escape Velocity brings the Caught on Earth arc to a conclusion. It's not necessarily a satisfying one, but it does provide a good jumping off point for the next series of adventures (even down to the menacing shadow on the TARDIS door at the end of the book).	2001-08-15
