How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	5	34	41	N	N	while it is not "the economy, stupid", it should be	It's perfectly clear why rich people vote Republican.  They want and get lower taxes as a result.  Big business also clearly loves Republican legislators because they give them what they want (less regulation, more loopholes, more domination, etc).  <br />But as a liberal (by the way, I don't drink latte, am not rich, don't like the vulgarity so prevalent in the media - controlled, by the way, by big business -, I believe in God, have simple tastes, try to live honestly and help others in need, and don't consider myself better than others), I've often wondered why so many lower and middle income people in places like Kansas vote Republican as well.  When the rich get lower taxes, the rest of us have to pay more.  When big business (e.g. ConAgra, Archer Daniels Midland) gets it's way, small farmers are forced off the land, small businesses are overrun by the Wal-marts of this world, health care and drug costs go up, etc.  This book clearly explains why, better than any other I'm familiar with, James Carville's famous slogan, \\"It's the economy, stupid\\" is not operative here.  It is, rather, cultural issues, some real (e.g. abortion, gun control) but most false and playing on feelings of inferiority/superiority (what you drink - latte? - how you talk - use big words? bad - think you're better than me?  - I'm much more down home and authentic than you).<br />What a shame distortions, biases and hatred of others perceived as \\"different\\" from us plays such a large role in American politics.  It is no accident, but rather a well orchestrated and financed campaign from the right.	2004-07-03

To a large extent, as this book points out, this is the fault of journalists, whose primary job is, or should be, to discover and report the truth about important issues of the day.  Democracy cannot function well if the public is constantly mislead.  And simply presenting opposing views does not help the public determine the truth.  Truth telling needs to be rewarded and deception needs to be punished.  This is not happening now.  <br />Real journalism is not about repeating the \\"spin\\" but finding the truth.<br />As the book says:  \\"Reporters should help the public make sense of competing political arguments by defining terms, filling in needed information, assessing the accuracy of the evidence being offered, and relating the claims and counterclaims to the probable impact of the proposed policies on citizens and the country.\\"<br />This can be hard work.  It is much easier to focus on the \\"horse race\\" and personalities and that is why over 70% of elections stories in 2000 did not mention any issue at all.  <br />This book should be required reading for all journalists and concerned citizens.	2003-08-11

This book blows that myth out of the water better than any other.<br />The ONLY clearly liberal program I find in the mainstream media is Bill Moyer's NOW once a week on PBS.  Talk radio is clearly dominated by right wing extremists.  TV news seems mostly interested in maintaining ratings and so broadcasts what they think will bring in the most viewers (e.g. programs on missing children).<br />Mainstream media in the U.S. is now, unfortunately, dominated by a few large corporations, and the situation is getting worse by the day.  The people who run these corporations are not liberals.  Indeed, some of them have a clearly right-wing agenda (e.g. Rupert Murdoch).  The people who write stories for these corporations are not eager to offend their bosses.<br />The blame lies clearly with the public, as the book points out:  &quot;Because most members of the public know and care relatively little about government, they neither seek nor understand high-quality political reporting and analysis.  With limited demand for first-rate journalism, most news organizations cannot afford to supply it, and because they do not supply it, most Americans have no practical source of the information necessary to become politically sophisticated.  Yet it would take an informed and interested citizenry to create enough demand to support top-flight journalism....&quot;	2003-05-27

Wilson presents useful, practical suggestions that address the current global crisis involving overpopulation, wasteful consumption, and unprecedented loss of biodiversity.  <br />For example, Wilson points out that roughly $30 billion (about 1/1000th of the annual combined GNP of the world as of 2000) can preserve for future generations critical habitats containing about 70% of the Earth's plant and animal species.  Contrast this with about $110 billion spent annually by governments to subsidize fossil fuels and nuclear energy.<br />Wilson is correct in pointing out that the question of the century is:  How best can we shift to a culture of permanence, both for ourselves and for the biosphere that sustains us?  This is something new in human history.  He points out that for hundreds of millennia those humans who worked for short-term gain within a small circle of relatives and friends lived longer and left more offspring .... the long view that might have saved their distant descendants required a vision and extended altruism instinctively difficult to marshal.  <br />The book also contains a wealth of fascinating information about our world.  E.g. Only three plant species stand between humanity and starvation:  wheat, maize, and rice .... yet at least 10,000 plant species can be adapted as domestic crops.  New World amaranths, arracacha of Andes, and winged bean of tropical Asia are immediately available for commercial development...  e.g. If a small and otherwise unknown animal encountered in the wild is strikingly beautiful, it is probably poisonous; and if it is not only beautiful but also easy to catch, it is probably deadly.. e.g  The vast majority of cells in your body are not your own: they belong to bacterial and other microorganismic species.	2002-10-08

Investors must find ways to verify what is going on inside the corporations that hold their money, or they must decide that they have reason to trust the leadership team and place their bets on the people in charge.<br />The authors point out that if financial planners and brokers are smart, they will begin to position themselves as \\"investor's representative\\" to the capital markets.   Investors want to know more about the companies in their portfolio and how the professionals are making sure that money is not in the hands of the fakers.  Investors may also want to see that their investment advisers have a little skin in the game as well.<br />Here are some of the useful reforms suggested by the authors:<br />1. If executive sells company stock, put 50% of proceeds in escrow for minimum of two years; audit companies would have to place 30% of their fees in same kind of account.<br />2. Provide some kind of limited insurance (e.g. $100,000 maximum like FDIC) to protect individual investors from fraud, paid for by publicly traded corporations<br />3.

In 1997, he was suddenly ostracized by his former buddies on the right for not being tough enough on Hillary Clinton in his book 'The Seduction of Hillary Clinton', after finally having pangs of conscious about what he had been doing.  He writes:  'The days of six-figure salaries and seven-figure book contracts were gone once I split from the movement.... I found other magazines in the journalistic mainstream willing to publish me, despite my checkered journalistic past.  The experience was an eye-opening one.  I'll never forget the panic that came over me when I received the first call from a fact checker at New York magazine, asking me to submit my notes for a story.  In twelve years of right-wing journalism, my work had never been fact-checked.'<br />This is one of the most important and disturbing books of our time and should be read by all Americans.  It lays out in great detail various components of the 'vast right-wing conspiracy' (it really exists) and shows how it has, over at least the past twelve years, poisoned political dialog in the United States by polluting the various media and political commentary with a continuous stream of lies, distortions and innuendos.  Spin trumps truth.  Cruel smears are disguised as thorough 'investigation.'  Continual repetition of egregious lies becomes the accepted 'truth.'  The politics of hate and polarization drive out the politics of consensus, compromise, civility and restraint.<br />The degree of hatred these people have for the Clintons and 'liberals' is truly scary, especially considering the extent to which they have gained power and influence in Washington D.C. and in the media.  These people are truly at war with the 'other side,'  and anything goes if it helps them gain power for themselves and for the right-wing social and economic interests they represent.  We see or hear them every day, ad nauseum, all over the so-called 'liberal' mainstream media and in the Bush administration, toned down, of course, to appeal to a wider audience.<br />Truth-telling and trust are essential ingredients for a democracy (as well as capital markets) to function successfully.  Will mainstream America ever wake up to the deception?  If they read books like this, they will.  If, more likely, they listen to and believe the mainstream media, filled with the very people this book exposes, they won't.  How depressing!	2002-07-10

I failed to weigh my findings against the fact that all of my sources were pro-Thomas partisans.....

Its the fallacy of the straw man.<br />Here are a few examples from just the first few pages of the book:<br />(Softs are Huber's term for the bad guys, people typically referred to in our culture as 'environmentalists'.)<br />&quot;Convinced that markets fail left and right, the Softs set about moving the production of ordinary goods -- food, transportation, power, and countless others -- out of the market and into the public sector.&quot;<br />&quot;(Softs) believe that only government can set things right and can set it all right, every last wisp and trace and molecule of it.&quot;<br />Softs think that the computer models that they use &quot;can link any human activity, however small, to any environmental consequence, however large.&quot;<br />&quot;To the Soft Green, the model is everything.  Only the model can say just where the dioxin came from or how it may affect our cellular protein.&quot;<br />You get the idea.<br />It seems that Huber is basically saying (allow me to oversimplify a bit)  that if you can't put a physical border around it (e.g. a park), it is not worthy of environmental concern or protection.<br />If you are interested in doing something positive for the environment, I suggest that you read instead &quot;Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices - Practical Advice from the Union of Concerned Scientists&quot;, by Michael Brower and Warren Leon.	2000-11-10

Perkins, a Professor of Logic, provided an excellent and concise explanation of logical thinking by using examples of illogical statements drawn from several books by Rush Limbaugh.  <br />Honest, logical, clear thinking is the only sure antidote I can think of to the distorted, hateful, polarizing rantings of people like Limbaugh.  <br />Congratulations, Dr. Perkins!	2000-10-19

Itis pragmatic.  <br />It also seems strange to judge the book solely bythe highly debatable point of whether or not Posner violated the Canonof Judicial Ethics in writing it. <br />Should Clinton have been impeached, and if impeached, convicted?  Richard Posner says the question is unanswerable.  So why read this book?<br />This book shows how an outstanding mind thinks through important legal and moral issues where existing law and precedent are unclear or inconclusive.  It is highly critical of almost everyone involved, including Republicans, the Supreme Court, Clinton's defenders, William Bennett, the TV pundits and 'intellectuals' who commented on the case.  The four hours I spent reading this book were far more interesting, clarifying and valuable by far than the many hours I spent in front of the TV during the year or so of the crisis.  Too bad this book wasn't available in the early months of the crisis.  A lot of misleading and inaccurate information and thought could have been sorted through much more easily.<br />Here are a few of the many interesting points made by Posner, with which I agree:<br />1.  It is on the ground of disrespect for his office and for decency in the conduct of government that the most powerful case for impeachment and conviction could have been pitched.<br />2. A President has a duty to avoid becoming enmeshed in a scandal that is likely to weaken his effectiveness.  In running that risk, for wholly personal rewards, the Clinton exhibited a high degree of personal irresponsibility.  That was a personal failing.  But the avoidance of scandal is also a public duty - a precondition to the effective discharge of the President's other public duties.<br />3. A pragmatic decision-maker wants decisions to be based on an assessment of their probable consequences.  In legal cases, and a fortiori in impeachment, which is only quasi-legal, this is a legitimate or at least common approach when the conventional materials of legal decision-making, such as precedent or a clear statutory or consittutional text, yield no direction.  Since it is unknowable whether the good consequences of impeaching and removing Clinton outweigh the bad, the pragmatist would lean against impoeachment.<br />4. Those who claim that the failure to impeach Clinton makes what he did OK, or puts him 'above the law' are just wrong.  He remains subject to the ordinary processes of the law, whether during or after his term.<br />5. To keep on lying after no one believes you does not mislead, but it shows contempt for truth and truthfulness.<br />6.  Clinton made a travesty of the religious rite of atonement by asking for forgiveness and absolution without offering to incur any cost.	2000-04-06

I'm a Democrat  who voted twice for Clinton, but this characterization of this book is  completely untrue.  This book is pragmatic, not partisan.<br />Should Clinton  have been impeached, and if impeached, convicted?  Richard Posner says the  question is unanswerable.  So why read this book?<br />This book shows how an  outstanding mind thinks through important legal and moral issues where  existing law and precedent are unclear or inconclusive.

Too bad this book wasn't available in the early months of the  crisis.  A lot of misleading and inaccurate information and thought could  have been sorted through much more easily.<br />Here are a few of Posner's  more interesting views, with which I agree:<br />1.  The volume and brazenness  of Clinton's lies are impressive.  As Posner says, to keep on lying after  no one believes you does not mislead, but it shows contempt for truth and  truthfulness.<br />2.  Clinton made a travesty of the religious rite of  atonement by asking for forgiveness and absolution without offering to  incur any cost.<br />3.  The Supreme Court should not have allowed Paula  Jone's suit to proceed during Clinton's presidency.<br />4.  The avoidance of  scandal is a public duty of the President, since it weakens his  effectiveness in discharging other public duties.<br />5.  Failing to convict  Clinton does not send a message that what he did was OK, or that he is  'above the law'.  He remains subject to the ordinary processes of the law,whether during or after his term.	2000-01-24

Woodward's central thesis is that none of the five Presidents following Nixon learned  the basic lessons of Watergate:  1)  if there is questionable activity,  release the facts as early and completely as possible and 2) do not allow  outside inquiries to harden into a permanent state of suspicion and  warfare.<br />I do not think, however, that Jimmy Carter's presidency is  guilty of this charge.  Nothing in the chapters devoted to Carter shows  that Carter tried to cover up any misdeeds.  Indeed, the only misdeeds  alleged were those of two subordinates, Bert Lance and Hamilton Jordan, and  in both cases the misdeeds were found to be untrue or greatly exaggerated.	1999-10-26
