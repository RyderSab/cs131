The author intends to understand love in all its particulars, including its scientific basis.  He defines love as that which \\"satisfies one's need to receive and bestow affection and nurturance; to give and be given assurances of value, respect, acceptance and appreciation; and to feel secure in a unity with, and belonging to, a particular family, as well as the human family\\" (9).  Walsh laments that even social scientists who explore behavior have infrequently studied love.  He is convinced, however, that humans must probe the nature of love and learn how to generate it and sustain it.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections.  The first, entitled \\"Skin Love,\\" deals with the importance of love in early infancy.  Included in this section are chapters exploring the importance of touch and tenderness upon infants in their first experience of love.  Walsh also addresses how messages of love affect the structure and function of the infant's developing brain.  A chapter is devoted to the differences between male and female parental love upon children.  The impact of loving care upon the triune nature of the brain is also examined.  It is Walsh's contention that \\"love is not merely theologically or philosophically desirable, but it is also a biological and psychological necessity\\" (37).<br /><br />In the second section, Walsh examines what he calls, \\"kin love,\\" by which he means the loving ties with one's fellow human beings.  In examining kin love, the author investigates the psychological and physical problems associated with the absence or deprivation of love.  He notes that children suffering from psycho-social dwarfism are severely retarded in physical growth.  Walsh notes the negative effects upon the immune system and the susceptibility to disease that those experience who have not been loved adequately.  He also points out that love deprivation may interact with social and biological correlates of schizophrenia.  Research details the importance that love plays in prevention of suicide; love also is a deterrent for drug and alcohol abuse.  In a chapter devoted to criminology, Walsh shows the disturbing statistics by detailing the correlation between lawlessness and the lack of giving and being given love.  In the section's final chapter, he argues that some social forms are conducive to love and some are inimical.<br /><br />The book's third segment, which Walsh titles \\"In Love,\\" deals with romance and how romantic love is generated and sustained.  The origin of sex is addressed, as well as the way chemicals in the brain and body effect one's romantic inclinations.  Walsh looks at the different ways in which humans -- both males and females -- choose partners and what each finds attractive in the other.  Included in this section are Walsh's thoughts about scientific evidence for monogamy, promiscuity, and orgasm.<br /><br />Throughout all three sections, the author relies heavily upon scientific data and the theories of prominent scientists to unravel theories of love that correspond with the work of science.<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordints out that love deprivation may interact with social and biological correlates of schizophrenia.

This book is a devotional book of sorts, published by a Muslim society in the United States. The author is a Sufi mystic from Sri Lanka.<br /><br />The author advocates compassionate love as an instance in the ray of God's infinite love.  The author's intent is to \\"lighten your heart, a map to help you find the treasure hidden within you.  That treasure contains the most valuable and elusive things in life which everyone seeks but very few ever find -- unconditional love, everlasting youth, and unchanging truth\\" (ix).<br /><br />Muhaiyaddeen suggests that the only kind of love that is truly beneficial is selfless love.  \\"Unless love is connected to God, unless it is connected to truth, to compassion, to justice, and to grace, it is possible for it to breakdown\\" (7).  God's love must take shape within humanity, which means that divine love must form in human hearts.  Such love includes the suffering with those who suffer and selflessly giving to those who are in need.  \\"We must draw that grace and that treasure within us.  This love is true love, the love borne of faith and trust, the love borne of brotherly unity, the love that comes from being one family, the love that comes from prayer, the love that comes from merging with God, the love which has no limit\\" (20).<br /><br />The author argues that love entails relationships with others.  \\"Once you have God's love, God's qualities, and God's actions, everyone is connected to you, and therefore you will feel the suffering no matter whose it is\\" (24).<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oord	2005-03-25

This book offers numerous anecdotes and illustrations concerning work in Habitat for Humanity since its inception.  The author speaks from a Christian perspective and identifies core Christian convictions that undergird his ministry.<br /><br />The author contends that the theology of the hammer means that Christian faith demands more than just talk and singing.  \\"We must put faith and love into action to make them real, to make them come alive for people\\" (7).  This theology is also about bringing together diverse peoples, churches, and organizations to help build houses and establish viable communities.  Even though those involved may have diverse political, philosophical, or theological preferences \\"we can agree on the imperative of the Gospel to serve others in the name of the Lord\\" (7).<br /><br />Fuller believes that sufficient resources exist for solving the problem of poverty housing and homelessness.  \\"Everybody made in the image of God, and that's the whole crowd, ought to have a decent place to live and on terms they can afford to pay\\" (17).  Although his work consists mainly stories of practical work in building homes, Fuller acknowledges that, in addition to the Bible, he has been influenced by such theologians as Walter Rauschenbush, Albert Schweitzer, Alan Durning, Henri Nouwen, and Dorothy Day.<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oord	2005-03-25

Although Avis notes early that by eros he means a philosophical concept that has to do with the profound human drive toward creativity and fulfillment, much of the book has to do with the author's understanding of female sexuality and gender as related to eros.<br /><br />According to Avis, many contemporary feminists cannot find a spiritual home in Christianity because they experience rejection or indifference.  Avis responds to this problem by looking at insights from human and social sciences and carrying out an ideological critique of biblical and traditional Christian assumptions about women and their place in the sacred realm.  The dominant image of women in the Bible and the Christian tradition is, unfortunately, the product of a series of male-centered and male-dominant social systems.  These social systems have distorted the Christian theological understanding of the nature of God, the person of Christ, and human well-being in relationships, community, and especially sexuality.<br /><br />Because Christianity and the church should be in the business of therapy, i.e., healing humanity's deepest wounds, it has a responsibility to act in ways that inspire men and women to become whole persons.  In other words, says Avis, \\"The Church must become the locus of transforming therapy - a therapeutic community\\" (71).  The therapeutic community must reflect the good life inspired by love and guided by knowledge.<br /><br />To argue his points, the author examines a wide variety of literature including psychology, philosophy, and theology.  He specifically addresses sexuality as sacred and profane in the Christian testaments.  In this literature, Avis notes both the resources for affirming eros and the role of women and also examples in which eros and women are identified as unintellectual and as weaker sexual objects. One thing the church can do today, suggests Avis, is to invite women to take their rightful place in representative ministry.  It can open the publicly important realm of the sacred.  It can invite women into the sanctuary where holy things are handled on behalf of God and humanity.<br /><br />Avis's comments on Anders Nygren's classic, Agape and Eros, are engaging.  He rejects Nygren's thesis that God and eros cannot be correlated.  Avis believes that the consequences of denying eros in God are extremely serious.  It means that eros in human beings has no source, analogy or hope of redemption in God; our erotic nature in itself alienates us from God.  Avis argues that one cannot integrate eros with the sacred unless one finds a place for eros in the very life of God. He concludes that \\"a Christianity that stresses inherent dignity of human beings, even those who have suffered fearful indignities at the hands of nature or fellow humans, as the presupposition of human rights and social justice, will speak more readily of the eros of God at work in and through His created world\\" (136-137).  If eros and agape are united in God, there would be no conflict in our understanding between the self-giving sacrificial love of God and that overflowing goodness that longs to impart good to creatures.<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oorded as unintellectual and as weaker sexual objects.

He finds that agape as verb or noun occurs 262 times in the New Testament; philia as verb or noun occurs 23 times, which does not include philia's derivatives translated \\"kiss\\" or \\"brother\\" nor its adjectival and adverbial forms.<br /><br />An examination of the entire New Testament reveals that both agape and philia are used in reference to (1) the Father's love for the Son, (2) the Lord's love for humans, (3) Jesus' love for humans, (4) human love for Jesus, and (5) human love for humans.  Upon examining every instance of  agape and philia in the New Testament, Butler concludes that for every utterance of philia there is an example of agape expressing nearly the same idea (70).  Ironically, agape is the only love word of the two used to describe the love of humans for Jesus and God, a fact placing in question Anders Nygren's preference for labeling human response as faith rather than agape.  Furthermore, the verb form of agape is never used to speak of God's love for humans in the Synoptic Gospels, another fact that should have led Nygren to reconsider his thesis.<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oord	2005-03-25

Fiddes notes at the outset that theological statements throughout the history of the church have tended to support a view of God as unmoving, unchanging and unsuffering.<br /><br />Today, however, at least academic theologians emphasize their strong conviction that God does suffer.  The author attempts to offer a coherent notion of a God who both suffers and yet can fulfill divine purposes.  The view he offers understands God as freely choosing to be self-limited, to suffer change, to be affected by time, and experience death, while remaining the living God. The author is especially influenced by process theological conceptions, but, in the end, the position he takes is his own; it is not in line with \\"orthodox\\" process thought.<br /><br />Four major contributions have been made to the present debate about whether God suffers.  The first, represented by Jurgen Moltmann, understands the suffering of God as being derived from the theology of the cross.  The nature of God is revealed in the cross of Jesus as God participates in human history.  A second major contribution comes from American process philosophy.  In this vision, every participant, including God, is bound in a network of mutual influences with others.  This means that divine suffering becomes central to divine action.<br /><br />The third dominant contribution to the present debate on the suffering of God comes from the mid-20th century \\"Death of God\\" theological movement.  Finally, those whose sympathies remain with classical theism continue to exert some influence in the debate.  \\"A theology of a suffering God needs to weave all four of these strands into a pattern, or to use another image, it must stand where four ways cross\\" (15).  The chapters in the book explore the four major contributors to the current debate upon divine suffering.<br /><br />In a chapter Fiddes titles, Why Believe in a Suffering God, he proposes four reasons why this theme is especially important in contemporary theology.  First, it is difficult to understand what it means to say that God is a loving God if God does not suffer.  Second, if the cross of Jesus Christ is central to Christian theology, this implies a notion of a God who is affected by the world and its experiences.  Third, the problem of human suffering, itself, calls for a Creator who suffers along with creatures in pain.  Finally, the scientific and natural view of existence supports the idea of an interactive deity.<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordtitles, Why Believe in a Suffering God, he proposes four reasons why this theme is especially important in contemporary theology.

The author believes that understanding feminine image of God ultimately empowers both men and women. \\"I want to delve deeper into just one way in which the Bible supports human sexual equality and mutuality: the images of God as female that sprinkle the sacred writings of Judaism and Christianity\\" (7).<br /><br />After surveying the history of what has happened to female imagery of God in Scripture, Mollenkott focuses on a series of Scriptural images and their implications for 20th century society.  These feminine images found in scripture include God as a nursing mother, a mid-wife, a mother pelican, a female homemaker, a bakerwoman, female beloved, mother eagle, and Dame Wisdom.<br /><br />Mollenkott concludes the tome with suggestions for how the understanding of the divine feminine might be included in contemporary worship.  \\"If our goal is pointed inclusion of females in the feminine in the language of worship, we may find ourselves utilizing female god-images and pronouns as frequently as possible\\" (115).  She also urges for Christians to refer to God in terms of the language of love.  Because love has traditionally entailed characteristics more commonly assumed to be feminine, referring to God as love in Christian theology would be helpful in reclaiming the images and language association with femininity found in the Christian Bible.<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oord	2005-03-25

He argues throughout that traditional doctrines of Christianity are best understood when grounded upon the doctrine of divine love.  Humans perceive the presence of God in both the natural and human environment, which means that humans experience love in ordinary daily life.  This also means that the entire universe is conceived in love, sustained by love, and directed towards its consummation.  In this sense, love has cosmic proportions.<br /><br />In light of understanding Christianity as founded upon love, Allen argues that Christians must act differently.  In particular, Christians must: be attentive to academic and scientific disciplines, learn to see ourselves as the objects of perfect love, aware of that which is beyond our present life, pay attention to Jesus and confess what we see in Him, and forsake the world.  Death should be seen as the complete destruction of the self-centered life that we now have, and life after death as resurrection should be understood as possible because of divine love.  The author sums up the book by saying that he has argued that the presence of God can be perceived indirectly by a person who is moving away from a self-centered stance and who has forsaken the world.  \\"The more our life is disciplined by attentiveness to others, and the more we cultivate an awareness of the inability of the world to give us the fulfillment that we crave, the deeper and clearer is our awareness of God's presence\\" (103).<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oord	2005-03-25

Pinnock and others publicly presented the view in a 1994 book titled, The Openness of God.  For those unfamiliar with the basic outlines of this theological alternative, Pinnock provides ample definition and characterization of it in Most Moved Mover.<br /><br />Openness theology envisions God as a self-sufficient, though relational, Trinitarian being who voluntarily created the world out of nothing.  God graciously relates to the world as one self-limited out of respect for the genuine freedom of creatures.  This relational, pantemporal God does not exhaustively foreknow future actual events.  Above all, the open view of God emphasizes love as God's chief attribute and as the primary priority for theological construction. \\"The living God is . . . the God of the Bible,\\" writes Pinnock, \\"the one who is genuinely related to the world, whose nature is the power of love and whose relationship with the world is that of a most moved, not unmoved, Mover\\" (3).<br /><br />The book's introductory chapter may be the most interesting part of the book to those already familiar with the general themes of openness theology.  In it, Pinnock cites numerous objections to the Open view penned mostly by Evangelical theologians of a Calvinist bent.  For instance, \\"I have to say, with regret,\\" says Don Carson of The Openness of God, \\"that this book is the most consistently inadequate treatment of scripture and historical theology dealing with the doctrine of God that I've ever seen from the hands of serious Evangelical writers.\\"  Robert Morey criticizes the open view by calling the deity it envisions \\"the finite God of evangelical processianism.\\"  \\"We have here a different God,\\" contends Bruce Ware, \\"not merely a different version of God.  For the sake of the glory that is God's alone, we have no choice but to reject the openness model.\\"  R.C. Sproul reacts to Pinnock's theological proposal by stating:  \\"Clark Pinnock is not a believer -- I would not have fellowship with him.\\"  Sproul writes elsewhere, \\"this fascination with the openness of God is an assault, not merely on Calvinism, or even on classical theism, but on Christianity itself.\\"<br /><br />While Reformed criticisms have been harsh, not all Evangelicals object to the Open view of God.  Pinnock lists those found mostly in Wesleyan, Arminian, and Pentecostal circles as appreciative hearers and sympathizers.  In addition, \\"there's a whole new large group called `Christians in Renewal' who enjoy a very relational and intimate spirituality and who, when they hear of it,\\" notes Pinnock, \\"often resonate with the open view of God.  Their presence on the scene may make this a truly new debate and more than a rehash of the old one\\" (18).<br /><br />Following the lengthy introduction, the remaining chapters follow the four-fold approach of the Wesleyan quadrilateral.  Because Pinnock looks to Scripture as the primary source for theology, he addresses how it corresponds with his proposed view. Pinnock admits that he gives particular weight to narrative and to the language of personal relationships in scripture.  He also accepts diversity among the biblical witnesses and recognizes the dialogical character of the Bible.  But \\"conventional theists have difficulty with open view of God because it challenges certain well-established traditions,\\" suggests Pinnock, \\"not because it is unscriptural.\\"  He finds Open themes throughout the biblical witness: \\"for example, the idea of God taking risks, of God's will being thwarted, of God being flexible, of grace being resistible, of God having a temporal dimension, of God being impacted by the creature, and of God not knowing the entire future as certain\\" (64).<br /><br />Pinnock turns in chapter two to assess the authority of the Christian tradition. Just as Christians need to render the Word of God intelligible today, the tradition must continually be scrutinized for its soundness and relevance.  Unfortunately, formal Christian theology has been less positive in terms of understanding God's dynamic activity than has the life of Christian piety.  The tradition's theology has sometimes lost a biblical focus, such that the package of divine attributes presented by theologians leans in the direction of divine immobility and hyper-transcendence.  This is due particularly because of the influence of Hellenistic categories of unchangeableness.  After briefly considering figures in Christian history, including Aquinas, Augustine, and Philo, and after addressing evangelical responses to the concept of God, Pinnock concludes that the basic tenets in the open view, \\"grows out of ideological, if not the ecclesiastical, soil of Wesleyan-Arminianism\\" (106).<br /><br />This reviewer found chapter three, \\"The Metaphysics of Love,\\" the most exciting of the book.  In it Pinnock explains his preference for dynamic, relational philosophy as opposed to substantive philosophy of classical thought.  He believes that addressing philosophical suppositions is important, because \\"theological integrity and the credibility of the concept of God in our time are both at stake\\" (118).  Pinnock argues that the open view adopts a \\"biblical philosophy\\" -- rather than currently available philosophical propositions -- as the basis for itself.  He contrasts his biblical philosophy with process philosophy because, as he understands it, process thought places priority on identifying a contemporary conceptuality and looks secondly to biblical teaching.  With regard to arguments for the existence of God, Pinnock opts for the cumulative case for God's existence.  He supposes that all people have an intuition that deity exists; the philosopher must provide a coherent and consistent conceptuality of the One whom so many intuit.<br /><br />The Metaphysics of Love chapter provides Pinnock with the opportunity to address how the open view relates with process philosophy.  \\"Process thought is an impressive modern conceptuality with a lot to offer,\\" Pinnock acknowledges (141).  The open view shares with process thought the desire to overcome an emphasis upon the metaphysic of being and to emphasize, instead, a metaphysics of becoming.  Pinnock believes process theologians are correct to conceive of God as affecting everything and being affected by everything.  He agrees with the process notion that God is temporally everlasting rather than timelessly eternal.  He also agrees that God should be understood as passable, not impassable, and omniscient in the sense of exhaustively knowing all that can be known.  In fact, says Pinnock, \\"I appreciate Whitehead and Hartshorne much the way the conventional theists appreciate Plato and Aristotle\\" (143).  Pinnock provides a helpful list of convictions that process and open theists hold in common. \\"We:<br /><br />* make the love of God a priority;<br /><br />* hold to libertarian human freedom;<br /><br />* are both critical of conventional theism;<br /><br />* seek a more dynamic model of God;<br /><br />* contend that God has real, not merely rational, relationships with the world;<br /><br />* believe that God is affected by what happens in the world;<br /><br />* say that God knows what can be known, which does not amount to exhaustive foreknowledge;<br /><br />* appreciate the value of philosophy in helping to shape theological convictions;<br /><br />* connect positively to Wesleyan/Arminian traditions. (142-143)\\"<br /><br />Open theism is not process theism, however.  \\"Process philosophy can be helpful,\\" admits Pinnock, \\"but [it] must be refashioned and cannot be adopted wholesale\\"  (148).  Process thought is based upon the metaphysics of Whitehead, whereas openness is a biblical theology not obligated to any philosophical scheme.<br /><br />The way in which open theists characterize God's relationship with the world receives much of Pinnock's attention as he distinguishes between process and open theisms.  \\"Like process [theism], we want to preserve the transcendence of God while denying the separation of God in the world,\\" explains Pinnock.  \\"But unlike process, we want to conceive the relationship as a voluntary, not a necessary, one\\" (144).  Pinnock argues elsewhere that \\"the self-sufficiency of the triune God underlines the fact that the world exists by grace, not by necessity\\" (125).  Pinnock continues his criticism of process thought by saying that \\"we [Open theists] hold that God is ontologically other than the world and in a certain sense `requires' no world.  God does not have to relate to some other reality because he is internally social, loving and self-sufficient\\" (145).

The open view shares with process thought the desire to overcome an emphasis upon the metaphysic of being and to emphasize, instead, a metaphysics of becoming.  Pinnock believes process theologians are correct to conceive of God as affecting everything and being affected by everything.  He agrees with the process notion that God is temporally everlasting rather than timelessly eternal.  He also agrees that God should be understood as passable, not impassable, and omniscient in the sense of exhaustively knowing all that can be known.  In fact, says Pinnock, \\"I appreciate Whitehead and Hartshorne much the way the conventional theists appreciate Plato and Aristotle\\" (143).  Pinnock provides a helpful list of convictions that process and open theists hold in common. \\"We: <br />* make the love of God a priority; <br />* hold to libertarian human freedom; <br />* are both critical of conventional theism; <br />* seek a more dynamic model of God; <br />* contend that God has real, not merely rational, relationships with the world; <br />* believe that God is affected by what happens in the world; <br />* say that God knows what can be known, which does not amount to exhaustive foreknowledge; <br />* appreciate the value of philosophy in helping to shape theological convictions; <br />* connect positively to Wesleyan/Arminian traditions. (142-143)\\" <br /> <br />Open theism is not process theism, however.  \\"Process philosophy can be helpful,\\" admits Pinnock, \\"but [it] must be refashioned and cannot be adopted wholesale\\"  (148).  Process thought is based upon the metaphysics of Whitehead, whereas openness is a biblical theology not obligated to any philosophical scheme.   <br /> <br />The way in which open theists characterize God's relationship with the world receives much of Pinnock's attention as he distinguishes between process and opentheisms.  \\"Like process [theism], we want to preserve the transcendence of God while denying the separation of God in the world,\\" explains Pinnock.  \\"But unlike process, we want to conceive the relationship as a voluntary, not a necessary, one\\" (144).  Pinnock argues elsewhere that \\"the self-sufficiency of the triune God underlines the fact that the world exists by grace, not by necessity\\" (125).  Pinnock continues his criticism of process thought by saying that \\"we [Open theists] hold that God is ontologically other than the world and in a certain sense `requires' no world.  God does not have to relate to some other reality because he is internally social, loving and self-sufficient\\" (145).  The Open vision of the Trinity-world relation provides a way to conceive that God is essentially loving, while also conceiving of creation as a free gift, not a necessity. <br /> <br />The last chapter of the book, \\"The Existential Fit,\\" addresses theology's adequacy to the demands of life.  Pinnock believes that the openness model is more relevant than conventional theologies to real life situations, and open theism confirms deep human intuitions about choice and the future.  \\"It is no small point in favor of the openness model,\\" contends Pinnock, \\"that it is difficult to live life in any other way than the way it describes\\" (23).

He does so believing that love is \\"such a rich phenomenon provoking questions in ontology, epistemology, the philosophy of mind, theology and philosophy of religion, and that to restrict the investigation of its many forms and dimensions to the ties between love and sexuality is to commit a painful, conceptual truncation\\" (ix).<br /><br />The contents of the book are broken into four main sections: \\"Where We Are;\\" \\"Classical Sources;\\" \\"Exploring the Classics;\\" and a contemporary analysis of love.  Throughout the book, Soble often relates the word \\"love\\" to its various romantic implications.<br /><br />Soble's method in putting the book together is to provide three or four primary writings prefaced by a summary of the reason these writings are important.  He introduces the entire book, however, by asking, \\"What is love?\\"  \\"The complexity of this question - compare it to, What is a chair? - is reflected in the fact that so many different answers to it exists and debates about the nature of genuine love seem impossible to resolve\\" (xix).  Love can be compared to art, for each is equally a difficult domain to describe.<br /><br />One of the reasons love is so difficult to explain is that the word refers to many different things.  Often, however, the attempt to conceptualize love is framed with regard to the Greek love words - eros, philia, and agape.  Soble believes that the general characterization of `eros-style' love arises in this way: x loves y because y has attractive or valuable qualities.  `Agape-style' love is understood as x loving y independently of y's merit.  This book offers original formulations of the theories of eros, agape and phileo and then attempts to explain more generally what these love types might mean for contemporary thinking.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oord	2004-08-31

The essays are the product of a conference entitled \\"Empathy, Altruism and Agape: Perspectives on Love in Science and Religion.\\"  Major funding for this 1999 conference came from the John Templeton Foundation and John Fetzer Institute.<br /><br />\\"It is in the context of the dialogue between science, philosophy and spiritual traditions that this book addresses various views of the roles of altruism and egoism,\\" writes editor Stephen G. Post (5).  \\" Our intent in this book is to grapple honestly with current scientific questions about the existence of genuine altruism and to explore the nature of human other regarding motives and acts\\" (6).  Among the tasks that the book addresses is the effort to understand better the emergence of altruism and empathy and how these contribute a greater capacity to love.<br /><br />The book is organized into five sections.  In the first, four essayists wrestle with the definitions of altruism, agape, and love.  Elliott Sober defines altruistic behavior in his essay as enhancing the fitness of someone else at some cost in fitness to the donor.  Sober's own position on the emergence of altruism and egoism is a pluralistic one in the sense that Sober recognizes that humans and other organisms have both egoistic and altruistic inclinations.  Edith Wyschogrod writes as a phenomenologist who claims that moral experience begins with a claim upon the self to engage in other regarding acts.  In this sense ethical meaning arises in the encounter with another human.  Jerome Kagan, a psychologist, asserts that the human being is utterly unique emergent from evolution with a moral sense.  It was with the evolution of the human brain that humans could evaluate vice and virtue.  Stephen G. Post examines the tradition of agape in light of altruism and altruistic love.  According to Post, altruistic love does not eclipse the care of the self, but it effectively affirms participation in the being of the other.  \\"Altruism is other regarding, either with regard to actions or motivations; altruistic adds the features of deep affirmative affect to altruism; agape is altruistic love universalized all humanity as informed by theistic commitments\\" (56).  Despite universalization, however, \\"agape forces us to honestly the ordering of our love and care with respect to both the nearest and the very neediest on the face of the earth\\" (59).<br /><br />The second section of the book takes up the social scientific research and addresses this in this relationship to altruism and love.  This section notes that observing or measuring motivations with regard to love is very difficult.  Lynn Underwood addresses data from selected studies and attempts to map a conceptuality of love from the social science perspective.  She wrestles with basic notions of love, self, context and freedom among other things.  In his essay, C. Daniel Batson challenges the common assumption that all behavior is selfish.  Batson's \\"empathy/altruism\\" hypothesis is that other-oriented emotional response evokes a motivational state with the ultimate goal of increasing the other's welfare.  Batson looks at more than 25 experiments to distinguish between self-directed motives and truly altruistic motives.  Batson says that the tentative conclusion from his studies is that feeling empathy for a person in need does evoke altruistic motivation to help that person.<br /><br />Kristen Renwick Monroe defines altruism in terms of actions rather than motives.  Monroe suggests that perception of the self in relation to others strongly affects decisions to be altruistic.  Finally, Samuel Oliner analyzes altruistic behaviors of rescuers of Jews during WWII and volunteers working with the dying.  He characterizes altruism as actions that are (1) directed toward another, (2) involve a high risk or sacrifice to the actor, (3) are accompanied by no external reward and (4)voluntary.  After examining data of the two groups, both the rescuers and those involved in hospice, Oliner concludes that there is no single motivating explanation that triggers people to behave compassionately for the welfare of others.  However, Gentile rescuers who risked their lives for Jews had learned compassion, caring norms, and responsibility for diverse others from parents and others in authority.  Hospice volunteers exhibited a higher degree of intrinsic religiosity, despite a lower incidence of affiliation with mainstream religious traditions.  Oliner suggests that social institutions, whether they be religious, educational or in the workplace, need to reconsider their roles and responsibilities so that they might foster kind and loving acts.<br /><br />The third section of the book takes up the debates within evolutionary biology and psychology with regard to egoism and altruism.  Michael Ruse outlines the genecentric sociobiological perspective on altruism.  He asserts that a Darwinian interpretation of social behavior and morality requires that organisms be reproductively beneficial.  Stephen Pope addresses the varieties of love from the perspective of theology and biology and speaks of an ordering of loves.  Pope suggests that appropriate altruism comes out of who we are rather than being an imposition that occurs contrary to our deepest native needs and desires.  \\"I believe the goods valued by both the moral egoists and the moral altruists can be assimilated and properly coordinated within a balanced interpretation of the ordering of love\\" (170).  David Sloan Wilson and Elliott Sober consider the history of altruism and evolutionary biology.  They note the fluctuation that the history of altruism has had but hope that altruism will find a permanent place in dominant evolutionary thinking.<br /><br />Melvin Konner reviews data from evolutionary biology, primatology, and anthropology.  He describes obstacles to altruism and notes that evolutionary theory makes most disinterested forms of altruism problematic.  In particular, aggression in both non-humans and humans makes altruism problematic.  Jeffrey P. Schloss surveys evolutionary approaches to human cooperative behavior and notes that the good news is that current theory is conciliate in its affirmation of that natural basis for genuine other regard within kinship or social groups.  The challenging news, however, is that the counterpart of such affiliation is exclusion towards those outside those groups.  There is no biological theory proposed for how out-group sacrifice and \\"love your enemy\\" altruism can come about.  \\"If the struggle for existence is the engine of natural selection and survival of the fittest is the direction of travel, then those organisms that sacrifice their biological well-being for the good of another will be kicked off the train\\" (214).<br /><br />The fourth section of the book considers the emotional aspects of altruistic love by focusing on the role of empathy in both humans and non-humans.  This section discusses the evolutionary advantages of particular anatomical, physiological, and psychological developments.  Essayists considers how developments in these fields provide a basis for varied forms of altruism.  Neuroscientist Thomas Insel discusses his work in neurochemistry and neurophysiology in rodent species.  His findings point to the possibility that in human beings subtle genetic variations may underlie individual differences in the capacity and inclination for attachment and other forms of altruistic behavior.  Neurologist Antonio Damasio discusses evolutionary origins of emotions and feelings, their fundamental adaptive value, and the extension in the empathetic processes that allow human sociality and altruism.  He notes that the emotions use the body as their theater.  The foundational processes of emotion and feeling, coupled with an individual's ability to know of the existence of such emotions and feelings in the self and others, are the basis of what is best in humans, including conscience, ethical rules and the codification of law.  Hanna Damasio discusses case reports of patients with damage to the portion of the brain that appear critical in the foundational processes of altruism.  She concludes that there is a system in certain sections of the prefrontal cortex that is critical for the learning and maintenance of certain aspects of social behavior that pertain to interpersonal relationships.  Damage to this results in defective decisions regarding altruism.  Her work underscores the claim that the capacity for altruism has a physical foundation.<br /><br />Primatologists Stephanie Preston and Frans deWaal consider the behaviors and linkage between humans and non-humans.  They report on what appears to be a degree of cognitive empathy among the great apes.  Empathy is a general class of behavior that exists across species to different degrees of complexity.  The data from primatology warns against drawing demarcation lines between humans and other animals with respect to emotional aspects of empathy.  The basis in emotional and social connectedness is crucial to an understanding of empathy and altruism because is creates the bridge between ultimate and proximate explanations and between philogeny and ontogeny.  William B. Hurlbut concludes the section with his own chapter on empathy, evolution , and altruism.  He claims that the beginning of sociality are seen even in the most primordial configurations of living matter.  \\"Among the earliest lifeforms, organisms drew information from one another to pattern and coordinate such basic biological functions as reproduction and nourishment\\" (310).  Empathy is a form of intersubjectivity in which the observer actually participates in the feelings of the other.  Hurlbut notes that the idea the human life has a moral dimension and this is in some sense a product of the universe is at odds with prevailing scientific culture.  To assert an objective ethical order within nature would be to affirm teleology, the reality of human freedom, and the unique status of our species.  Hurlbut argues that \\"for all the controversy concerning the possibility of genuine generosity and altruistic love, at the levels of life, amid the sounds of the street and the strivings and struggles, there is everywhere, in small or greater degrees, the evidence of love.  Many people, perhaps most, in some way give the effort and energy of their lives from a belief in love and the desire to build a better world.  If there is a natural sentiment and hope, it is that love is real\\" (325).<br /><br />The fifth section looks at altruistic love from a religious context.  Don S. Browning suggests that evolutionary biology is moving religious thinkers toward a synthesis model in which love is understood as having both altruistic and egoistic aspects.  Browning argues that the moral theologian \\"would finally ground the sacrificial element in love on the Christian's belief in the infinite value of the other and on the sense that some acts of self sacrifice are both willed and empowered by God, even though self-sacrifice, as such, might not be seen as the central goal of Christian love\\" (344).  Gregory L. Fricchione interprets human religious expression as an outgrowth of evolutionary developments centered around separation and attachment theory.  Fricchione claims \\"separation/attachment is a  common referent conferring extensional identity across different conceptual levels of complexity\\" (354).  Agape is a healthy synthesis of self-affirming/self-realizing love with self-giving love.  Reuben L. F. Habito concludes the volume by speaking of compassion and love from a Buddhist perspective.  The compassionate life from a Buddhist perspective is an outflow of the wisdom that truly sees the way things are.  The view of reality that overcomes the separation of self and other.  Habito suggests that Buddhism offers a valuable contribution inforging a common future as the earth community.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordgs in the self and others, are the basis of what is best in humans, including conscience, ethical rules and the codification of law.

The author aims at a theological anthropology in the light of the natural sciences.  In other words, the book wrestles with the question of who human beings are, what they are, and what they are alive for.  Hefner positions himself in what he calls the Hebrew/Jewish/Christian stream.<br /><br />The book's arguments are set before the reader in clear fashion. First, he argues that humans are thoroughly natural creatures having emerged from natural evolutionary processes.  These processes have produced culture, and humans are members of culture.  Second, the planet is in critical condition and it is the challenge of humans to fashion a viable system of cultural information to fulfill their human nature in this ecosystem.  Third, myth and ritual, which emerged somewhere between 100 thousand and 20 thousand years ago, provide information to enhance human life in its present threatened conditions.  And finally, we are required today to use science and myth to offer proposals for the direction, meaning and purposes of humanity.<br /><br />Hefner's influential theory of humans as \\"co-creators\\" is developed fully in this book.  The theory of the co-creator involves three aspects.  One, \\"the human being is created by God to be a co-creator in the creation that God has brought into being and for which God has purposes.  Two, the conditioning matrix that has produced the human being--the evolutionary process -- is God's process of bringing into being a creature who represents the creation's zone of a new stage of freedom and who, therefore, is crucial for the emergence of a free creation.  Three, the freedom that marks the created co-creator and its culture is an instrumentality of God for enabling the creation (consisting of the evolutionary past of genetic and cultural inheritance as well as contemporary ecosystem) to participate in the intentional fulfillment of God's purposes\\" (32).<br /><br />The author's proposals related to love, altruism and morality come near the end of the book.  Hefner is well aware of and critiques various theories related to altruism proposed by philosophers and scientists.  He suggests that \\"our moral action of love for God and neighbor is our way of living in harmony with the way things really are\\" (191).  In other words, the love that God has for us and our love for God and neighbor places us in the all-encompassing symbolic universe that drives the Christian tradition.<br /><br />The Christian myth entails that \\"all morality presupposes and is response to the prior love of God for us, a love that seeks our well-being and the fulfillment of that for which we have been created\\" (194).  Nature itself is an ambiance in which humans belong and that enables humans to fulfill the purpose for which they were brought into being.  \\"The central reality that undergirds all concrete experience and to which we continually seek to adapt,\\" claims Hefner, \\"is disposed toward us in a way that we can interpret as graciousness and beneficent support\\" (194).<br /><br />The author devotes a chapter in his book to altruism and Christian love.  He argues that the concepts of altruism articulated in evolutionary biology focus on the same phenomenon as the love command of the Hebrew/Christian tradition.  The evolutionary, biocultural sciences approach beneficent behavior from the perspective of natural history of life.  Myth and ritual, however, approach this phenomenon from the perspective of human culture.  Christian theology should interpret beneficent behavior as an expression of the basic cosmological and ontological principles.  In addition, Christianity should consider altruism to be an intrinsic value, rooted in the fundamental character of reality.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordintentional fulfillment of God's purposes\\" (32).   <br /> <br />The author's proposals related to love, altruism and morality come near the end of the book.

US	34883430	R20WN6QFAU44Q9	0521531829	32948398	Upheavals of Thought: The Intelligence of Emotions	Books	5	8	9	N	N	RE: A Wide-Reaching and Novel Philosophical Exploration	Philosopher Nussbaum argues in this book, the product of her Gifford Lectures, that emotions shape who we are, and they must form part of a system of ethical reasoning as intelligent responses to the perception of value.  Emotions include in their content judgments that can be true or false and good or bad, and they act as guides for ethical choice.  \\"A central part of developing an adequate ethical theory,\\" claims Nussbaum, \\"will be to develop an adequate theory of the emotions, including their cultural sources, their history in infancy and childhood, and their sometimes unpredictable and disorderly operation in the daily life of human beings who are attached to things outside themselves\\" (2).  Emotions have a complicated cognitive structure in relation to objects that we cherish and this relationship extends over time.  And this means that without emotional development, a part of our reasoning capacity's political creatures will be missing.<br /><br />Nussbaum's Neo-Stoic inspired project is to construct an analytic framework for thinking about emotions in general.  Emotions \\"involve judgment about important things, judgments in which, appraising external objects are salient for our own well being, we acknowledge our own neediness and incompleteness before parts of the world that we do not fully control\\" (19).<br /><br />In her first chapter, \\"Emotions as Judgments of Value,\\" Nussbaum sets out the basis for her argument about the intelligence of emotions. Emotions view the world from the perspective of one's own scheme of goals, the things to which one attaches value for what it means to live well.  In short, emotions are valuative appraisals of the world.<br /><br />Continuity exists between humans and non-humans in that both display emotions. Studies of animal emotions underscore Nussbaum's claim that cognitive appraisals need not all be objects of reflexive self-consciousness.  Although all individuals feel emotions, both human and non-human, this does not mean that individual histories and social norms do not shape emotions.  In fact, they do.  A path should be steered between those at one extreme who argue that emotions are totally constructed by society and those at the other extreme who argue that society plays no role in the shaping of emotions.<br /><br />Emotions \\"bear the traces of a history that is at once commonly human, socially constructed, and idiosyncratic\\" (177).  This means that adult human emotions cannot be understood without understanding their history in infancy and childhood.  Nussbaum rejects theories calling individuals to bring every emotion into line with the dictates of reason, or the dictates of one's ideals, whatever they may be.<br /><br />In the second part of this 700 page book, Nussbaum focuses upon the emotion of compassion. She defines compassion as \\"a painful emotion occasioned by the awareness of another person's undeserved misfortune\\" (301). Compassion includes cognitive aspects, including (1) the belief or appraisal that the suffering one encounters is serious rather than trivial, (2) the belief that the person does not deserve the suffering, and (3) the belief that the possibilities of the person who experiences the emotion are similar to those of the sufferer.<br /><br />Compassion involves a significant quasi-ethical achievement in that it values another person as part of one's own circle of concern.  One should not depend upon the vicissitudes of personal emotion, but should build emotion's insights into the structures of ethical rules and institutions.  Furthermore, the relationships between compassion and social institutions is that compassionate individuals construct institutions that embody what they imagine and institutions influence the development of compassion in individuals.<br /><br />In the third part of the book, Nussbaum addresses various traditions of erotic love.  She does so hoping to show that erotic love can be part of morally acceptable life.  Erotic love \\"involves an opening of the self toward an object, a conception of the self that pictures the self as incomplete and reaching out for something valued\\" (460).

Its value is that it represents the work of theologians, mostly from Reformed theological traditions, who wrestle with how to conceive of divine love.<br /><br />The book's editor, Kevin J. Vanhoozer, begins his introductory essay -- the best essay of the book -- by noting that \\"it is exceedingly odd that Christian theologians have themselves been somewhat indifferent -- inattentive, neutral - with regard to the concept of the love of God\\" (1).  It is no exaggeration to say that the defining and situating of divine love is the perennial task of Christian theology.<br /><br />A growing number of Christian theologians believe that a major advance, even a revolution, in the understanding of the love of God has recently occurred.  The traditional view of God entails that the deity metes out good but takes neither joy nor delight in the good that comes about.  This classical God is immutable and impassable.  Several developments in the twentieth century, however, have changed the way we understand divine love.  Among the movements that have generated these developments are process philosophy, Trinitarian theology, liberation theology, feminist theology, and various Postmodern thinkers, like Jean- Luc Marion.<br /><br />Vanhoozer notes \\"the concept of the love of God is both fundamental to the doctrine of God and, oddly, disruptive of it.  There seems to be no place in a systematics in which the notion of the love of God neatly fits\\" (13).  When discussing the structure of systematic theology, Vanhoozer observes that the love of God functions either (1) \\"as a discrete doctrinal topic\\" or (2) \\"as the structuring principle that provides a point of integration or thematic unity between individual doctrines.\\"  \\"Somewhat surprisingly,\\" states Vanhoozer, \\"few theologians have chosen that latter option\\" (14).<br /><br />In the second half of the opening essay, Vanhoozer briefly discusses how love affects issues such as divine sovereignty, reciprocal relations, divine control, divine suffering, and panentheism.  After addressing these issues, he concludes that \\"we must say at least three things: the love of God is something that God has, something that God does, and something that God is\\" (23).  Vanhoozer closes his introduction by claiming that \\"the moral of this introduction is that the love of God should occupy no one place in a theological system, but every place\\" (29).<br /><br />The rest of Nothing Greater, Nothing Better book includes a variety of essays of varying degrees of helpfulness.  Gary Badcock looks at Anders Nygren's famous work, Agape and Eros and concludes, like many others before him, that it is appropriate to speak of divine eros.  On the basis of God's act in Christ, that is, creaturely response to divine initiative is something that God needs.<br /><br />Geoffrey Grogan reviews a diversity of the biblical evidence pertaining to love.  Lewis Ayres reflects upon Augustine's understanding of the love of God as it is expressed in St. Augustine's commentary on First John and in his work, On the Trinity.  Trevor Hart considers the question of how we speak of God.  Following Karl Barth, he concludes that the possibility of human speech about God rests entirely upon the incarnation.  What we have in the incarnation is a God-given analogy.  Alan Torrance also addresses analogical language, the incarnation, the trinity, and other issues. Torrance wonders if love can be understood as God's essence, and, disappointingly from this reviewer's perspective, concludes that this question is unanswerable.  He also rejects natural theology and argues that only those who have fellowship with Christ will allow their minds and language become transformed as to speak adequately of God.<br /><br />Tony Lane addresses the question of God's wrath in relation to God's love.  Lane concludes that one must not affirm wrath as part of God's essence.  Paul Helm addresses the question:Can God love the world?  One of his conclusions is that God could not be equally benevolent to all human beings, but God can love all humans unequally. Helm also suggests, inaccurately from this reviewer's perspective, that the problem of evil is a matter of degree.  David Fergusson addresses the issues of eschatology by asking the question, \\"Will the love of God ultimately triumph?\\"  After all, if God's future is genuinely open, divine triumph over evil is not a foregone conclusion.  Fergusson argues that those who affirm double predestination and those who affirm universalism ultimately remove human freedom by construing God's love as something that constrains human choice.  Roy Clements concludes the book with a sermon on Hosea, chapter eleven.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordresses the question: Can God love the world?

The editors believe that love is a profound measure of human life, and a person's philosophy of love permeates his or her philosophy of life. The text includes more than forty contributions, most of them classic essays with regard to love.  \\"Developing a philosophy of life is not something we can relegate to others to do for us, like house building or plumbing repair, but something each of us must do for himself.  There is no escaping it, each of us is required to be something of a philosopher\\" (1).<br /><br />The editors divide the book into six parts.  Part one, titled \\"Romantic Love: Madness of a Normal Man,\\" has eight readings on romantic love.  The second part includes ten essays on eros.

At the root of the vision of deity they designate the \\"Open God\\" is their shared conviction that love is God's chief attribute, and all other divine attributes must not undermine the primacy of love.<br /><br />In order to offer a coherent doctrine of God, essayists address issues of divine transcendence, immanence, power, omniscience, mutability, and passibility.  At the core of his proposal is his account of divine loving activity that includes God's responsiveness, generosity, sensitivity, openness, and vulnerability.  In fact, Clark Pinnock contends that \\"love rather than almighty power is the primary perfection of God\\" (114).<br /><br />Essayists in The Openness of God argue that no doctrine is more central to the Christian faith than the doctrine of God.  Laying out a coherent, livable, biblical doctrine is crucial for the practical and theoretical aspects of theology.  Many Christians, however, observe an inconsistency between their beliefs about the nature of God and their religious practice.  For example, Christians ask God to act in a certain way when they pray, although their formal theology may suppose that God has predetermined all things.  A major factor in assessing the viability of a theological scheme, then, is the piety question: How well does this \\"live?\\"<br /><br />\\"How can we expect Christians to delight in God or outsiders to seek God if we portray God in biblically flawed, rationally suspect, and existentially repugnant ways?\\" asks Pinnock (104).  In his attempt to avoid rationally suspect hypotheses, Pinnock seeks to offer a coherent doctrine of God, i.e., each divine attribute \\"should be compatible with one another and with the vision of God as a whole\\" (101).<br /><br />The Openness of God authors share the basic conviction that love is the principal theme in Christian theology.  Pinnock insists, for instance, that love is the primary perfection of God.  Richard Rice, who assumes the task of offering biblical support for the open view advanced in the book, claims that the open view expresses two basic convictions Scripture supports.  First, love is the most important quality humans attribute to God.  Second, love is more than care and commitment; it also involves sensitivity and responsiveness.  Rice further notes that, from a Christian perspective, love is the first and last word in the biblical portrait of God.  When one enumerates God's qualities, one must not only include love on the list, but, to be faithful to the Bible, one must put love at the head of that list.  A doctrine of God faithful to the Bible must show that all God's characteristics derive from love.  Rice concludes: \\"Love, therefore, is the very essence of the divine nature.  Love is what it means to be God\\" (19).<br /><br />Pinnock embraces the notion that God is like a loving parent when affirming these hypotheses.  In this parental model, God possesses \\"qualities of love and responsiveness, generosity and sensitivity, openness and vulnerability\\" (103). God is a person who experiences the world, responds to what happens, relates to humans, and interacts dynamically with creatures.<br /><br />Essayists reject the classic conception of God described as \\"an aloof monarch\\" removed from the world's contingencies, i.e., the entirely transcendent God.  They reject the deity who is completely unchangeable, all-determining, irresistible, and does not risk.  \\"The Christian life involves a genuine interaction between God and human beings,\\" Pinnock contends.  \\"We respond to God's gracious initiatives and God responds to our responses . . . and on it goes\\" (7).<br /><br />Essayists also deny divine foreordination, divine foreknowledge of free creaturely actions, and the hypothesis that either divine foreknowledge or unilateral determination are compatible with creaturely freedom. God knows all things that canbe known, but divine omniscience does not mean that God possesses exhaustive foreknowledge of all future events. Total knowledge of the future would imply that future events are fixed.  \\"If choices are real and freedom significant, future decisions cannot be exhaustively known,\\" Pinnock explains (123).<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oords all things that can be known, but divine omniscience does not mean that God possesses exhaustive foreknowledge of all future events.

This evidence of altruism provides insights into the strengths and limitations of various theories about human behavior that typically emphasize individual self interest.<br /><br />Monroe develops her own theory for why altruism emerges, in which she argues that altruists have a different way of seeing things or a different perspective about the world and how to live in it.  She concludes that the self-interest paradigms that dominate explanations of human behavior produce only limited explanations for altruism.<br /><br />In the book's opening segment, Monroe confronts various definitions of altruism.  She ends up defining altruism as \\"action designed to benefit another, even at the risk of significant harm to the actor's own well-being\\" (4).  Various approaches to understanding altruism have proven dissatisfying.  The traditional economic, socio-cultural, biological, and psychological understandings of human nature cannot explain adequately altruism as Monroe defines it.  One's perspective, i.e. how one views the world, themselves, and others and how each are related, captures the importance of understanding altruism.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, Monroe pieces together various narratives from interviews of those who act altruistically.  Her interviews are of types of individuals she labels \\"entrepreneurs,\\" \\"philanthropists,\\" \\"heroes and heroines,\\" and \\"rescuers\\" of Jews in Nazi Europe.  Following the narratives, Monroe systematically examines the traditional explanations of altruism from economics, evolutionary biology, and psychology.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Monroe finds that among the altruists she interviews, few if any considered religion relevant to their altruistic acts.  Altruists did identify a spiritual feeling of closeness to others or a belief that all humans are a part of a large family.  She concludes that what generates altruistic acts is the individual seeing themselves and others as humans of valuable.<br /><br />Monroe addresses various other social and cultural factors that some have suggested induce altruism, and she found these factors as not important in the narratives she collects.  When examining economic explanations, Monroe concludes that \\"altruism is one area in which the limitations of the economic approach are abundantly evident\\" (160).  Her conclusion after examining explanations of altruism from evolutionary theory is that these theories do not specify the origin of altruism nor do they help contribute to the understanding of the most extreme forms of altruistic behavior.  To those who argue that altruism comes from the education and socialization patterns handed down from authorities, Monroe replies \\"it was the rescuers, precisely those individuals who come closest to approaching pure altruism in my sample and who most frequently expressed the universal moral principles of the highest stage of moral development, who deviated most wildly from their learned ethical beliefs, and they did so precisely in order to save victims of Nazi persecution.  Their altruism necessitated this deviation from their learned ethical systems\\" (194).<br /><br />In the fourth and final section, Monroe offers her own theory as a basis for understanding human nature, particularly expressions of altruism.  Monroe found that the most relative, cognitive component of the altruists she interviewed centered upon (1) their particular world views and (2) their expectations about what constitutes normal behavior.  Altruism became \\"a logical outgrowth of their sense of a self in relation to others\\" (197).<br /><br />Altruists described their world-view as universalistic in the sense that they valued all of human life and often all of non-human life.  Rescuers, for instance, were not motivated by the belief that the world is ultimately fair, nor did self-image seem to become a major factor inaltruism, nor did the feel obligations because of felt communal ties.  Instead \\"altruists have a particular perspective in which all mankind is connected through a common humanity, in which each individual is linked to all others and to a world in which all living beings are entitled to a certain humane treatment merely by virtue of being alive\\" (206).<br /><br />Monroe concludes her analysis by claiming that \\"humanity plus need: this is the only moral reasoning, the only calculus for altruism\\" (212).  While she admits that it may be possible that various mechanisms precipitate development or growth of an altruistic perspective, it is the perspective itself, she claims, that constitutes the heart of altruism.  The altruistic perspective consists of a common perception, held by all altruists, that they are strongly linked to others through a shared humanity.  The closing pages entail an ethical-political theory based upon the primary notion that one's sense of self in relation to others is the fundamental concept for ethics.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oorde a major factor in altruism, nor did the feel obligations because of felt communal ties.

Both are members of the Anabaptist Christian tradition, and their thought, especially as it relates to pacifism and ethics, reveal this connection to Christian tradition.  One of the book's virtues is that its authors clearly lay out their proposals in a very accessible manner.<br /><br />The overall argument for the book is the following: the fine-tuning of the cosmological constants that has produced a life-bearing universe calls for an explanation.  The authors believe that a theistic explanation offers a more coherent account of reality than a non-theistic one.  The pattern of divine action in the world, however, seems to indicate that God works with nature, \\"never over-riding or violating the very processes that God has created\\" (xv).  The fact the God does not violate or override the processes leads the authors to believe that divine action entails refusal to do violence to creation.  They link this with kenosis, a Christian New Testament word typically translated, \\"self-emptying.\\"  God renounces self-interest for the sake of the other, no matter what the cost is to God, and that this divine activity ought to be emulated by humans.  The authors call for a new research program to explore the possibilities of this kenosis thesis in light of science.<br /><br />The ethical core of the proposal is that self-renunciation for the sake of the other is humankind's highest goal.  One of the more illuminating chapters in the book addresses the power of persuasion, non-violent coercion, and violent coercion.  The authors argue that persuasion is to be preferred and they speculate that \\"a consistent policy of using the least coercive means possible in each social situation will affect the character of the individuals involved such that less coercion will be needed in future resolution of conflict\\" (151).  In sum, contemporary cosmology points ultimately to an ethic that centers on self-sacrifice and non-violence.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordints ultimately to an ethic that centers on self-sacrifice and non-violence.   <br /> <br />Thomas Jay Oord	2004-08-31

To do this, the author analyzes implicit principles of obligation and what the author calls \\"deep metaphors\\" imbedded in and around conceptualities of psychology.  Browning's work in this book has been vital reading for those engaging in issues related to psychology and religion.<br /><br />Presuppositions and resources in the Jewish and Christian religious traditions inform Browning's critique.  Among the dominant psychologies that the author addresses are those of Freud, Jung, behavioral psychology, humanistic psychology, and Erickson.  The dominant religious figures used to criticize and engage the psychologies include Reinhold Niebuhr, William James, and Paul Ricoeur.<br /><br />The author believes that modern psychologies are indispensable for modern life and that they should be evaluated for the ways in which they play the role of religion in modern thinking.  Clinical psychologies cannot avoid a metaphysical and ethical horizon.  A major assumption made by the author is that \\"traditional religion and modern psychology stand in a special relation to one another because both of them provide concepts and technologies for the ordering of the interior life\\" (2).<br /><br />The author labels various contemporary psychologies as \\"cultures.\\"  He associates Freud with, what he calls, \\"the culture of detachment\\"; the culture of detachment sees the world as basically hostile and humans are largely self-absorbed creatures with only small amounts of energy for larger altruistic ventures.  Humanistic psychologies and Jung are variations of what he calls the \\"culture of joy\\"; the culture of joy sees the world as basically harmonious.  Skinner is the example of the \\"culture of control\\"; the culture of control sees humans primarily as controlled and controllable by their environment.  Erickson and Kohut are examples of the \\"culture of care;\\" the culture of care grasps the tensions and anxieties of life and gravitates toward an ethics that finds a place for both self-love and self-transcending love for the other.<br /><br />Browning finds most affinities between Christian thought and the culture of care in the though of Erickson.  \\"It is my thesis that significant portions of modern psychologies, and especially the clinical psychologies, are actually instances of religio-ethical thinking\\" (8).  \\"It is not only in theology,\\" claims Browning, \\"but, to a surprising extent, in the modern psychologies as well, that the way we metaphorically represent the world in its most durable and ultimate respects, influences what we think and what we think we are obligated to do\\" (20).<br /><br />When addressing the Freudian-based modern psychologies, the author argues that psychoanalysis oscillates between ethical egoism and cautious reciprocity.  By contrast, Christianity celebrates the principle of self-giving love and justice.<br /><br />The critical chapter of the book comes in chapter 6, \\"Making Judgments about Deep Metaphors and Obligations.\\"  In it, Browning addresses the central or deep metaphor of Christianity, namely that the ideal of human fulfillment comes from the notion of self-sacrificial love as agape.  Browning looks at the works of Anders Nygren, Reinhold Niebuhr and Gene Outka.  Modern psychologies have put pressure on theology to build a greater place for self-regard into theology's model of human fulfillment.  The caritas model found in the work of theologians such as Louis Janssens provide a model of agape that has a place for both self-sacrificial love and also the mutuality of neighbor-to-neighbor love.  This model has the virtue also of incorporating insights on the importance of self-regard without overemphasizing self-regard to the detriment of equal regard for the other.  It is this caritas model to which the modern psychologies of Erickson and Kohut comeclosest.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordckson and Kohut come closest.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book! <br /> <br />Thomas Jay Oord	2004-08-31

The goal of the book is to instigate thought about the implication of the studies on altruism for different spheres of social life. The conference was composed of scholars from a multitude of disciplines and nations.  The topics they write about range from the highly theoretical to the strongly pragmatic.<br /><br />Essayists largely agree that it is the issue of motivation that is essential to an adequate notion of altruism. Each of the chapters in this book deals with the promotion of pro-social behavior and concern for the other.<br /><br />The book is broken into five major sections.  The first addresses philosophical, definitional, and conceptual issues related to altruism.  Krzysztof Konarzewski argues that heroic altruism requires both empathy with the other and protest - two quite different motivational orientations.  The protest has to do with independence based upon commitment to foundations of community life. Lawrence Blum argues that rescue involves moral principles beyond those merely of altruism.  The altruistic personality appreciates other values beyond altruism itself.  Victor Seidler criticizes the overvaluing of reason-duty to the neglect of emotion-based motivation like compassion.  Rather than traditions such as Christianity that emphasize ethical purity, Seidler suggests that the tradition of Judaism, which accepts emotion, self and individuality as well as social context as a more adequate approach.<br /><br />The second section is titled, \\"Sociobiology and Moral Altruism.\\"  The authors of two chapters in this section, Ian Vine and Ronald Cohen, reject exclusively biological-based altruism or exclusively cultural-based models and adopt the both/and model of biology and culture.  Genes provide a range of possible behaviors, but it is culture and learning that shape the selection of that range.<br /><br />The third section is entitled \\"The Development and Enactment of Altruism.\\"  Dennis Krebs and Frank van Hesteren argue that all people to a greater or lesser degree express altruism, and the capacity for altruism grows with social and cognitive development.  Krebs and van Hesteren proposed a \\"developmental-interactionalist\\" model consisting of seven cognitively based stage structures.  Maria Jarymowicz argues for what she calls an \\"exocentric altruism\\" that stems from centering on the other.  This altruism is more likely to result in an appropriate response when directed toward those who are dissimilar to the altruist. Those with a low self distinctiveness experience identity problems and are, therefore, more likely to discriminate against dissimilar \\"out-group\\" others.  Individuals with an extensive identification with a sense of connectedness to others tend to behave more altruistically than individuals with more limited identities.  Chapters by Zuzanna Smolenska, Janusz Reykowski, Leo Montada, and Elizabeth Midlarsky's proposed theories from empirical studies on altruism among those with a variety of ages and backgrounds.<br /><br />The fourth section, titled \\"Embracing the Outsider,\\" includes essays addressing altruistic behavior toward particular people groups.  Richard Hovannisian examines the acts of Turks who saved the lives of Armenians during the genocide of 1915.  Lawrence Baron and Ewa Kurek-Lisik look at the Dutch involvement of rescuing the Jews during the Holocaust.  They also examine the actions of Polish nuns who saved Jewish children.  Finally, Rachel Hertz-Lazarowitz tells the story of a passionate Israeli who fought the war of independence against Lebanon and subsequently devoted all of his time to helping the Palestinians against whom he fought.<br /><br />The final section of the book addresses issues pertaining to what is involved in the promotion of altruistic acts and altruistic bonds.  After noting that rescuers ofJews during the Holocaust were marked by what might be called extensivity-which is a dual orientation toward the attachments in interpersonal relationships as well as an inclusive sense of obligation toward multiple groups-Pearl and Samuel Oliner propose 8 social processes that might encourage and extensive orientation.  Rescuers of Jews had a propensity to assume obligations and social responsibility for all other human beings, perceiving them as worthy and deserving of help as well as empathy.

The book is written for a general but scholarly audience.  Our brains link us with those people to whom we love and as a consequence who we are, and who we become depends in great part on whom we love.  It is the body's physiology that ensures our relationships and identities.<br /><br />The authors lament that from the beginning of the 20th century to its end, the most influential accounts of love rarely, if ever, mentioned biology.  Although the authors point to important links between physiology and love, they do not claim to have solved all of the mysteries of love.  This book's thesis or agenda is described well when the authors asked this question: \\"What can the structure and design of the brain tell us about the nature of love?\\" (18)<br /><br />One of the main theses of the book is that understanding love begins with understanding feelings rather than the reason.  \\"Emotion is the messenger of love; it is the vehicle that carries every signal from one brimming heart to another\\" (37).<br /><br />The authors document well the profound effects that various regions of the mind have upon human behavior.  For instance, the authors note that patients who have lost the hippocampi bear witness to the memory aspect of this region of the brain, because no explicit memories can be created without a hippocampus.<br /><br />The authors note the profound importance of relationships.  \\"The astounding legacy of our combined status as mammals and neural beings is limbic revision: the power to remodel the emotional parts of the people we love, as our attractors activate certain limbic pathways, and the brain's inexorable memory mechanism reinforces them\\" (144).  However, the neurostructures responsible for emotional lives are not infinitely adaptable in relationship.<br /><br />The book concludes with these words: \\"The adventure of seeking a theory of love is far from over.  While science can afford a closer glimpse of this tower or that soaring wall, the heart's castle still hangs high in the heavens, shrouded in scudding clouds and obscured by mist.  Will science ever announce the complete revelation of all love's secrets?  Will empiricism ever trace an unbroken path from the highest stone to the heart's castle down to the bedrock of certitude?  Of course not!  We demand too much if we expect single-handed empiricism to define and lay bare the human soul\\" (230).<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordcludes with these words: \\"The adventure of seeking a theory of love is far from over.

It is a liberation that opens us up and leads us to the discovery of our common humanity\\" (5).  Among the subjects addressed in the chapters are the following: loneliness, belonging, inclusion, freedom and forgiveness.  The author argues that by opening ourselves to outsiders we can achieve true personal and societal freedom, which includes the freedom to become truly human.	2004-08-31

Because so many have found process thought helpful, this text serves as a valuable resource for others wanting to become acquainted with the concepts that so many find valuable.<br /><br />While there is much in the book that is helpful, this review will concentrate upon the third chapter, titled \\"God as Creative-Responsive Love.\\"  The authors note that Process Theology, as they employ it, operates from the perspective of Christian faith on one hand and a metaphysical context provided by Process Philosophy on the other.  The authors explore what the Biblical phrase \\"God is Love\\" means, and they begin with an exposition of what it means for God to express sympathy.  Cobb and Griffin note that in classical theology, divine sympathy was denied: \\"This denial of an element of sympathetic responsiveness to the divine love meant that it was entirely creative; that is, God loves us only in the sense that he does good things for us\\" (45).<br /><br />The authors note that the traditional notion of love as solely creative was partly introduced to deny that God is dependent upon creatures in any way and that God's independence implies perfection.  Process theology, by contrast, understands God's emotional state as dependent upon creaturely existence. \\"Upon this basis, Christian agape can come to have the element of sympathy, of compassion for the present situation of others, which it should have had all along\\" (48).<br /><br />The creative activity of God is no less essential to understanding divine love than is the sympathetic aspect of divine love.  For instance, a loss of belief in the creative side of God's love would tend to undermine liberation movements of various kinds.  The creative love of God, however, is persuasive only.  The Cobb and Griffin note that the idea that God can intervene coercively has led to a variety of problems, especially with regard to the understanding the problem of evil and the science-inhibiting notion of the \\"God of the gaps.\\"  By \\"persuasion\\" the authors mean to deny that God has the ability to exercise controlling, unilateral power.  \\"Process theologies understanding of divine love as in harmony with the insight, which we can gain both from psychologists and from our own experience, that if we truly love others we do not seek to control them\\" (53).<br /><br />Cobb and Griffin note several advantages that their understanding of God as Creative-Responsive love entails.  One notion is that God is understood as promoting enjoyment instead of as the Cosmic Moralist.  \\"In traditional Christianity, morality and enjoyment were often seen as in fundamental opposition.  In Process Thought, morality stands in the service of enjoyment\\" (57).  Another advantage of understanding God's love as creative/responsive is that divine love can be understood as adventurous.  A God's creative activity that is exclusively persuasive corresponds with a love that takes risks.  This means that deity is not the sanctioner of the status quo, but God is still the source of the order that emerges in the world.  God is the source of order because God offers possibilities to creatures to respond in ways that increase enjoyment and design.  A third advantage of understanding God as Creative-Responsive love is that this entails that God's life is also on an adventure.  Finally, the God that Process Thought envisions possesses qualities typically considered feminine.  For instance, God is passive, responsive, emotional, flexible, patient, and appreciative of beauty.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordproblems, especially with regard to the understanding the problem of evil and the science-inhibiting notion of the \\"God of the gaps.\\"  By \\"persuasion\\" the authors mean to deny that God has the ability to exercise controlling, unilateral power.  \\"Process theologies understanding of divine love as in harmony with the insight, which we can gain both from psychologists and from our own experience, that if we truly love others we do not seek to control them\\" (53).  <br /> <br />Cobb and Griffin note several advantages that their understanding of God as Creative-Responsive love entails.

Although Sorokin is known for his work in sociology, he also established the Harvard Research Center for Creative Altruism due to his conviction about the power and importance of love. This review refers to the 2002 edition published by the Templeton Foundation Press; the book was originally published in 1954.<br /><br />Sorokin begins this large volume by considering seven aspects of love, including the religious, ethical, ontological, physical, biological, psychological and social.  While the book often cites spiritual and religious figures and ideas, the majority of Sorokin's interests revolve around the psychological and social aspects of love.<br /><br />In his chapter, \\"The Five-Dimensional Universe of Psycho-Social Love,\\" Sorokin provides a heuristic device for understanding various dimensions of love.  One dimension is love's intensity, whereby love is considered to have low or high intense forms.  The second dimension is extensivity, by which Sorokin means to denote the scope of love from love of oneself only to love of the whole universe.  The third dimension of love is its duration, which refers to the time during which love is expressed - from a moment to an entire lifetime.  The fourth dimension is purity, by which Sorokin means that the love that is free from egoistic motivation is purest.  The fifth dimension is love's adequacy, by which Sorokin means the objective consequences of one's action in comparison to one's subjective goals.  Using this five dimensional theme,  Sorokin can explore the varieties of love by characterizing them as exemplifying certain types.  For instance, some love may have low intensity but very high extensivity.  Or love may have great high purity but a very short duration.<br /><br />Sorokin considers love to be a type of energy, and he believes that the increase in the production of love energy to be of chief concern in our times.  Love, as a commodity that can be produced, might be increased through a variety of ways.  \\"Love, its properties, its empirical dimensions, the relationships between its dimensional variables, and, finally, the problems of the efficient production, accumulation, and distribution of love energy -- all of these open a vast, little known, and desperately field of exploration.  At the present time mankind perhaps needs to explore this field more than any other\\" (46).<br /><br />In a chapter exposing the benefits of love, Sorokin lists the<br /><br />following: love stops aggression, love begets more love, love increases human vitality and longevity, love is an element in curing disease and sickness, love integrates the psyche of an individual, and love becomes a creative force for good in social movements.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, Sorokin addresses basic mental and personal structures of humans as the relate to love.  \\"The ultimate task of these studies is to find out the efficient ways of making persons more creative and altruistic.  In order that this purpose may be fruitfully advanced, one has to have an adequate theory of the mental structure of the human personality and of the energies generated in operating through the human organism\\" (83).<br /><br />Sorokin's own theory of human personality is that humans have four energies: the biologically unconscious or subconscious level, the biologically conscious level, the socio-culturally conscious, and what he calls the \\"supraconscious.\\"  The author is most interested in the supraconscious of an individual, by which he means that which manifests the greatest creative victories and what is most typically linked in humans with the divine.  Theistic individuals often attribute this supraconscious as either God working through them or God inspiring in them to do some particular activity.  It is this supraconscious intuition that informs the highest human creativity in virtually all the fields of inquiry, from religion toscience.  Sorokin appeals to the ideas and saints in a variety of religious traditions as evidence of those who acknowledge this supraconscious in the world.  The perfectly integrated creative genius most in touch with the supraconscious is one in whom the five aspects of love operate at a high level.  This means that \\"supreme love can hardly be achieved without a direct participation of the supra-conscious and without the ego-transcending techniques of its awakening\\" (125).<br /><br />In the book's third section, Sorokin addresses various ways in which altruism might grow.  To do this, he examines logical arguments, empirical evidence from various individuals throughout history, and testimonials.  Sorokin places the great altruists of history in a three-fold typology.<br /><br />The first, what he calls \\"fortunate altruists,\\" are loving and friendly from childhood.  The most important factor to understanding fortunate altruists is that these individuals were raised in a good family that loved them and expected them to be loving.  \\"It is much easier to grow in the family garden a large crop of creative altruists from newborn babies that it is to transform a grown-up egoist into an altruist\\" (205).<br /><br />The second type of altruists, whom Sorokin calls \\"late altruists,\\" become altruistic because of a sharp turning point later in their lives.  It appears that a deep inner war in the mind and values of the late altruist becomes the driving force that brings them to decide to act altruistically.  Sorokin also finds that, although altruists participate in a variety of living situations, the overwhelming majority of outstanding altruists were born and raised in ordinary socio-cultural environments.<br /><br />The third type of altruist, what Sorokin calls the \\"intermediary type.\\" These individuals turn to altruism at various points in life, and these turnings reflect milder transition periods.<br /><br />Sorokin argues that merely accepting the truth of certain values as important is not enough for an individual to become an altruist.  Rather, altruists are deeply permeated by the value of altruism, and this is evident in their ideas, emotions, feelings, volitions and actions.  When altruism is purely intellectual and when it does not permeate one's heart, emotions, and volitions, it does not produce loving results.<br /><br />Part four is the longest section of The Ways and Power of Love.  In it, Sorokin notes various techniques for the altruistic transformation of persons and groups.  \\"The altruistic formation and transformation of human beings is an exceedingly delicate, complex, and difficult operation.  There is no single magic procedure that can successfully perform it . . . to be effective, the methods must vary in accordance with the many conditions and properties of the individuals and groups\\" (287).  Several chapters are given to listing what comes to be 26 different techniques for enhancing altruism.<br /><br />Subsequent to examining these techniques, Sorokin offers a chapter on various techniques of yoga, followed by the techniques of the monastics.  He concludes with the techniques of \\"contemporary free brotherhoods,\\" such as Mennonites, Hutterites, and others.<br /><br />The fifth and final part of the book Sorokin addresses the questions of in-group and out-group altruism.  Unfortunately, in-group altruism tends to generate an out-group antagonism.  \\"The more intense and exclusive the in-group solidarity of its members,\\" argues Sorokin, \\"the more unavoidable are the clashes between the group and the rest of humanity\\" (459).  The universal or more extensive aspect of love ends up clashing with the narrow tribal in-group love.  What is preferred is the universalization of altruism.  \\"The universal sublime love is the supreme value around which all moral values can be integrated into one ethical system valid for the whole of humanity\\" (486).  This means that tribal solidarities must be transcended if inter-human warfare is to be eliminated from the world.<br /><br />The Ways and Power of Love is an essential text for those engaging in the dialog between theologies of love and science.  Stephen G. Post writes in the introduction that this book is Sorokin's greatest work and \\"a classic text that transcends the limits of any particular era\\" (xxvii).  The strengths of the text are many; the insights are vast.  Unfortunately, however, some of the work is unsystematic and at the sections seem disconnected.  The reader is left with the impression that, although Sorokin's insights ring true intuitively, there is a great deal more work to be done in carefully arguing and scientifically testing the various hypotheses he forwards.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordccepting the truth of certain values as important is not enough for an individual to become an altruist.

The story of Jesus Christ provides the key to understanding love in the Bible and also the content and rationale for Christian charity.  Jackson defines agape as the New Testament Greek word for the steadfast love that God has for human beings, as well as the neighbor-love humans are to have for one another (11).  \\"Only because God first loves us gratuitously,\\" says Jackson, \\"are we commanded and enabled to love God unreservedly and to love fellow human beings as we ought to love ourselves\\" (12).  Agape as found in scripture is characterized by three interpersonal features: \\"(1), unconditional commitment to the good of others; (2), equal regard for the well-being of others; and (3), passionate service open to self-sacrifice for the sake of others\\" (15).<br /><br />Jackson stresses that agape, as he understands it, does not make self-sacrifice essential.  However, openness to self-sacrifice, under the right circumstances, is definitive of the virtue of agape.<br /><br />Jackson distinguishes between what he calls \\"strong agape\\" and \\"weak agape.\\"  By strong agape, he means love as the primary human source and end that is indispensable for moral insight and power.  Strong agape is a metavalue by which he both individual integrity and social civility turn on a commitment to care for something larger than oneself or one's tribe.  In contrast, weak agape understands love as a moral virtue or value among equals with which it competes.  When addressing eros and philia, Jackson argues both are dependent upon agape for their beginning and their ordered continuing.<br /><br />With regard to ethical theory, Jackson argues that agape is like a duty in that it is not merely an optional good deed.  However, agape is more than a duty in that it is not merely obligation among others.  Rather, agape is what Jackson calls \\"primal goodness, the impetus behind all ethical actions and principles\\" (28).  Strong agape between human beings involves three dimensions of the moral life: traits of character, forms of action, and concrete social consequences.  The ethic of strong agape insists \\"that we are always called to do the loving thing, but it does not deny the relevance of agent-character or action-consequence\\" (214).<br /><br />In chapter two, Jackson uses novels written by Ernest Hemmingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald to wrestle with the question of whether agape should be understood as an instance of prudence or an  instance of self-sacrifice.  He concludes that neither view is adequate for the long-suffering love of agape as understood in the Christian gospel.<br /><br />Chapter three's discussion addresses agape, eros, philia and self-love by looking at the works of Augustine, Sigmund Freud, Simone Weil, and Edward Vacek.  Neither Freud nor Augustine have an adequate conception of Christian charity because, as he sees it, eros, philia, and self-love grow out of agape as its proper fruits and are secondary goods in comparison with the priority of agape itself.  Agape wills the good of others for their own sakes, but, in willing that good, agape may require sacrifice that outstrips the demand of strict justice and natural preference.<br /><br />In the chapter from which the book takes it title,  Jackson examines how Christianity's putting charity first among the theological virtues compares to a consoling, Boethian view of ethics.  A chastened view of charity best serves Christian epistemology and ethics, but a denial of foundationalism in epistemology does not require the loss of moral realism.<br /><br />Christian theology's priority of love rises above the question of immortality as endless life.  \\"Putting charity first implies that immortalityis not the greatest good, nor probably a necessary means to the greatest good\\" (170).<br /><br />Jackson concludes the book with thoughts on how love is expressed through the cross of Christ.  Love must be weaned away from traditional claims to certainty, invulnerability, immortality, and irresistible grace.  The strong agapist stands for the priority of love among genuine values and the steadfastness of love among real doubts<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordst implies that immortality is not the greatest good, nor probably a necessary means to the greatest good\\" (170). <br /> <br />Jackson concludes the book with thoughts on how love is expressed through the cross of Christ.

US	34883430	R20YWT36VCMORD	080062825X	283868922	The Trinity and the Kingdom	Books	4	19	21	N	N	Moltmann's Kenotic Theology of the Trinity	As one of the most influential theologians of the contemporary period, J&uuml;rgen Moltmann's works have influenced a variety of theologies of love.  The Trinity and the Kingdom brings together many themes found in his other books (e.g., The Suffering God and God in Creation), including the notion that God truly suffers with creaturely pain and that God is present and active in the world.<br /><br />What makes The Trinity and the Kingdom especially interesting is how Moltmann wrestles to explain how it is that God is essentially loving.  He acknowledges the truth of what many other love theorists have claimed: \\"love cannot be consummated by a solitary subject.  An individuality cannot communicate itself: individuality is ineffable, unutterable\\" (57).  This implies, says Moltmann, that \\"if God is love, then he neither will, nor can, be without the one who is his beloved\\" (58).<br /><br />Furthermore, because love relations imply some degree of need, God cannot be, in all ways, self-sufficient: \\"If God is love, then he does not merely emanate, flow out of himself; he also expects and needs love\\" (99).  Using \\"suffering\\" in its classical sense, which means to be affected by another, Moltmann argues that, \\"if God were incapable of suffering in every respect, then he would also be incapable of love\\" (23).<br /><br />The answer to many issues pertaining to divine love can be found when examining relations within Trinity.  God \\"is at once the lover, the beloved, and the love itself\\" (57).  This intraTrinitarian love is illustrated by the fact that, \\"in eternity and out of the very necessity of his being, the Father loves the only begotten Son. . . .  In eternity and out of the very necessity of his being, the Son responds to the Father's love through his obedience and his surrender to the Father\\" (58).  Three notions together - divine persons, divine relations, and change in divine relations -- provide the basis for conceiving of intraTrinitarian love.  Because love has everlastingly been expressed through intraTrinitarian relations, love can be considered an essential attribute of God.<br /><br />Moltmann entertains several hypotheses in The Trinity and the Kingdom for conceiving the correlation between the creation of the world and the Trinity.  Sometimes he speaks of God creating from chaos; other times of God creating from nothing.  He even places these apparently contradictory notions alongside each other; he speaks of divine creating as \\"creation out of chaos and creatio ex nihilo\\" (109).  He claims that \\"creation [is] God's act in Nothingness and . . . God's order in chaos\\" (109).  However, the evidence from his statements about God's love for the world being voluntary while the love between the Father and Son is necessary leads one to conclude that Moltmann ultimately affirms creatio ex nihilo, rather than creation from chaos.<br /><br />The creation hypothesis Moltmann proposes most vigorously, however, is based soundly upon intraTrinitarian suppositions: \\"If we proceed from the inner-trinitarian relationships of the Persons in the Trinity, then it becomes clear that the Father creates the one who is his Other by virtue of his love for the Son\\" (112). Because of this desire to communicate to nondivine individuals, it was through the eternal Son/Logos [that] the Father creates the world.  In fact, \\"the idea of the world is inherent in the nature of God himself from eternity\\" (106).  This means that \\"the idea of the world is already inherent in the Father's love of the Son\\" (108).  Because God creates the world in his love for the Son and creates through the Son, the Son \\"is the divinely immanent archetype of the idea of the world\\" (112).  The solution to how God and the world are related, then, is to suppose that the idea of the world has been eternally present to deity in the Son.<br /><br />Moltmann has been at the fore in suggesting that kenosis, as God's self-emptying love, should be seen as the clue to God's loving creation and interaction with the world.  \\"The divine kenosis which begins with the creation of the world reaches its perfected and completed form in the incarnation of the son\\" (118).  This self-emptying kenosis provides the key for understanding how God can be, in essence, wholly omnipotent and yet completely loving.  God, in free self-sacrifice, gives up power, knowledge, and presence to allow space for creatures to be.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordving creation and interaction with the world.  \\"The divine kenosis which begins with the creation of the world reaches its perfected and completed form in the incarnation of the son\\" (118).

By agape love, he means love that is unlimited, pure, and unconditional as well as altruistic.<br /><br />Templeton argues that agape love expresses a unity of purpose that is common to all people.  It holds within it the opportunity to transcend differences of religious beliefs and to live in joy and peace.  Agape involves feeling and expressing pure, unlimited love for every human being, with no exception.<br /><br />The author recognizes that all religions are not the same.  And it is also not his goal to convert persons from one religion to another.  \\"Rather, the purpose is to point toward the possibilities and responsibilities of love.  It is to awaken people to the realization that despite the differences, all religions share some very important, fundamental principles and goals, the highest of which is the realization of agape love -- unconditional, unlimited, pure love\\" (5).<br /><br />The eight religious traditions explored are Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Native American Spirituality.  The author concludes with these words: \\"The option to grow in agape is open to everyone on earth.  It is an invitation to true happiness for you and others.  May it become our aspiration, our expression of God's love radiating through us\\" (111).<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oord	2004-08-31

The work in the initial segments is largely autobiographical as the author identifies his own journey to the theology of love that he eventually proposes.<br /><br />In attempting to understand the purpose of the church, Vanstone wrestles with what it might mean for the church to glorify God.  He comes to believe that God can be glorified only if God is truly interested in the work of the church.  It is the importance of the church's work and his awareness of material reality that leads Vanstone to suppose that the whole of creation is a work of love.<br /><br />After rejecting the idea that divine love is wholly dissimilar to creaturely love, the author argues that we must extrapolate from the authentic love that we see around us in the creaturely world.  In his analysis of the phenomenology of love, Vanstone discovers three signs of authentic love.  The first is that authentic love has no limitation, in the sense that it does not choose to love some people and hate others.  This does not mean that love is not constrained by circumstances, however.  The authenticity of unlimited love involves the totality of giving of oneself to the other.  The second mark of authentic love is the giving up of control.  Love becomes distorted when it attempts to possess or manipulate the other.  This means that love is risky, for it cannot control the other and often fails in its attempt to benefit the other.  The third mark of authentic love is that the other affects it.  The love gives to the object a certain power over the one loving.  The one loved affects the one loving.  This means that lovers are vulnerable.<br /><br />Upon examining a phenomenology of creaturely love, Vanstone turns to address divine love.  He attributes to God a love that is limitless, vulnerable, and precarious.  He appeals to the idea of kenosis, in the sense that God is self-giving in expression of love for creatures.  The activity of God's love in creation is precarious, by which Vanstone means that it must not \\"proceed by an assured programme\\" (62).<br /><br />The precariousness of divine love is especially evident in the fact that evil exists.  The fact that evil occurs implies that there is an other that is not divine; it does not imply that evil is willed by the creator.  Vanstone argues that the God who foreordains and predetermines cannot be a God who loves.  \\"If the creation is the work of love, its `security' lies not in its conformity to some predetermined plan, but in the unsparing love that will not abandon a single fragment of it, and man's assurance must be the assurance not that all that happens is determined by God's plan, but that all that happens is encompassed by His love\\" (66).  When addressing the vulnerability of divine love, Vanstone contends that divine loving activity can result in either triumph or tragedy.  Which of these two it will be is determined in part by creaturely response.  This implies that God has need.  For divine love to become complete, it must wait upon the understanding of those who receive it.  This means that the creativity of God is dependent upon the responsive creativity of the creatures.<br /><br />Trinitarian theology fulfills the requirement that God needs another.  \\"Trinitarian theology asserts that God's love for His creation is not the love that is borne of  `emptiness' . . . it is the love which overflows from fullness\\" (69).  \\"Of such a nature is the `kenosis' of God is the self-emptying of Him Who is already in every way fulfilled\\" (69).  It is God who awaits a response from creation, a response that issues in either triumph or tragedy.  \\"Tentatively, but with growing assurance, theology may interpret the dynamic of nature as the activity of love\\" (85).<br /><br />The proper human response to God amounts to the celebration of God's love, and that by which the love of God is celebrated may be called \\"the church.\\"  The church is wider than any recognized ecclesiastical structure, however, it includes the simplest action done out of awareness of God's love.  The church, says Vanstone, is \\"the sum of all the structures and forms within which man expressed the recognition of the love of God\\" (97).  In the visible church, humans aspire to create something that expresses their recognition of God's love.  The church exists as the point in which the love of God is most profoundly exposed as the possibility for tragedy or triumph.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordresponse to God amounts to the celebration of God's love, and that by which the love of God is celebrated may be called \\"the church.\\"  The church is wider than any recognized ecclesiastical structure, however, it includes the simplest action done out of awareness of God's love.

Adams understands God as the Good itself, which means that the Good is a concrete personal individual.  In Adams' metaphysics, God plays the part of the form of the beautiful in Plato's thought.  God as the supreme Good transcends all other goods.<br /><br />Adams believes that God's existence is metaphysically necessary, and those properties that fit God follow necessarily from the divine nature.  The supreme Good is one aspect of the divine nature.  This means that the only limits upon God are those that follow from God's own nature.  Love is a necessary aspect of the divine nature, but God's preferences and actions as expressions of love are contingent.  \\"The freedom ascribed to God does not include, as ours does, a possibility of desiring or choosing those ends that are rightly counted as bad\\" (48).  This means that the standard of goodness is defined by the divine nature and thus is good for all possible worlds.<br /><br />According to Adams' theory, what counts as good is not reducible to any human view about what the good is.  The good is not fully accountable by any empirical test.  Rather, the realm of value is organized around a transcendent good that is God.  This means that the nature of value cannot be confined to the horizon of the physical or human world.<br /><br />Adams makes a distinction between well-being and excellence.  He notes that most contemporary thought focuses mainly upon well-being, or what is good for a person.  Adams' own theory places primary importance upon excellence.  Excellence implies a goodness in itself rather than goodness for another. Interest in well-being is secondary to the greater interest in excellence.  What is good for a person is the living of a life characterized by the enjoyment of that which is excellent.<br /><br />In the second segment of the book, Adams addresses what it means for individuals to love the good.  The appropriate ethical relation is to be for the good, which entails loving it.  God expresses eros in that God loves the good.  Instead of understanding divine love as pure benevolence, Adams entertains seriously the notion that God desires relationship with creatures.  This non-instrumental interest in relationships and excellences is part of what it means for both God and creatures to love.  Adams considers what divine grace entails, arguing that it is a fundamental aspect of divine love.  \\"Grace is love that is not completely explained by the excellence of its object\\" (151).  While Adams claims that it would be absurd to suppose that all love excludes instrumental interest in the beloved, he also claims that love requires an interest in the beloved that is not merely instrumental.  \\"Even divine love would be the richer rather than the poorer for finding value in the beloved\\" (165).  Ideal love finds its reasons in the non-comparative appreciation of an object.  This means that God's love is directed to things that are good, but it is not dominated by caring about whether these things are the best. Adams concludes this section with chapters on devotion, idolatry, and the value symbols.<br /><br />Adams labels the third part of the book, \\"The Good and the Right.\\"  According to him, the good provides a proper framework for thinking about what is right and not the other way around.  What is good has a fundamentally social aspect.  Adams incorporates his theistic vision in chapter eleven by arguing that it is only the commands of a definitively good God that are candidates for defining what is human moral obligation.  A main advantage of divine command theory of the nature of moral obligation, argues Adams, is that it satisfies the demand for objective moral requirements.  There are a range of possibilities for how these commands are communicated or revealed by God.  These possibilities may include scriptural texts, utterances of prophets, requirements of human communities, individual intuitions, etc.  Signs that occur in time and place note these commands.<br /><br />After examining the story of Abraham and Isaac, Adams concludes \\"that in any cultural context in which it is possible to worry about Abraham's Dilemma, it will hardly be credible that a good God has commanded the sort of sacrifice that is envisaged here\\" (290).  \\"I think it is the part of religious as well as moral wisdom to dismiss all thoughts of our actually being commanded by God to practice something as horrible as human sacrifice.  The question whether God commands such a thing should stay off our epistemological agenda as long as it possibly can, which I expect will be forever\\" (291).<br /><br />The question of love and obligation leads to an inquiry into vocation.  Adams defines vocation as \\"a call from God, a command, or perhaps an invitation addressed to a particular individual, to act and live in a certain way\\" (301).  Direct and unambiguous commands from God are extremely rare, argues Adams, which means that conflicting values and obligations in any situation need to be thought about critically before interpreting these as communicating a divine command.  The concept of vocation helps to solve the issue of whether or not creatures can love all other creatures.  A divine call to love some persons and some kind of goods provides a way of understanding one's vocation.  These questions of vocation lead naturally to the concluding part of Adams' book, which address the epistemology of value.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordural texts, utterances of prophets, requirements of human communities, individual intuitions, etc.  Signs that occur in time and place note these commands.   <br /> <br />After examining the story of Abraham and Isaac, Adams concludes \\"that in any cultural context in which it is possible to worry about Abraham's Dilemma, it will hardly be credible that a good God has commanded the sort of sacrifice that is envisaged here\\" (290).  \\"I think it is the part of religious as well as moral wisdom to dismiss all thoughts of our actually being commanded by God to practice something as horrible as human sacrifice.

It needs to embrace a revelation-based strategy for Christian love theology, not requiring any co-relational stance between theology and modernity. God's revelation of love is a pure gift beyond reason and incomprehensible.  Marion's conversation partners in this book include Nietzsche, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Derrida.<br /><br />Theology is only proper when done within the horizon of God's own self-revelation as agape.  While God exists, Marion does not believe that one ought to ascribe being to God.  \\"Under the title, `God Without Being,'\\" explains Marion, \\"I am attempting to bring out the absolute freedom of God with regard to all determinations, including, first of all, the basic condition that renders all other conditions possible and even necessary - for us, humans, the fact of Being\\" (xx).<br /><br />While for humans it is necessary to be in order to love, \\"God is love\\" comes before \\"God as Being.\\"  God's primary theological name is charity, and in this sense Marion's enterprise is postmodern and similar to Derrida.  Marion concludes by suggesting that what can be known about God comes only in so far as God gives Himself as a gift, the \\"gift gives only itself.\\"<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oord	2004-08-31

The author offers this theological exposition as a defense of her thesis that John Wesley's theology provides the most adequate footing for a theology of love.  \\"It is this author's considered opinion,\\" contends Wynkoop, \\"that John Wesley has contributed a sound and useable approach to theology which is worthy of consideration in the solutions of the problems related to the theology-life syndrome.  His `hermeneutic' was `love to God and man.'  This theme runs throughout his works.  At least when each doctrine of the Christian faith is identified and defined by him, the basic meaning invariably comes out `love.'  Wesley's thought is like a great rotunda with archway entrances all around it.  No matter which one is entered it always leads to the central Hall of Love, where, looking upward toward the dome, one gazes into the endless, inviting sky.  There is no ceiling to love\\" (16). Although the vast majority of the book is given over to John Wesley's theology, Wynkoop acknowledges her indebtedness to the process theology of Daniel Day Williams.<br /><br />The thesis of the book is that the dynamic of Wesleyanism is love.  Rather than representing Wesley's theology as a theology of holiness, the author believes that it is more faithful to call Wesley's thought a theology of love.  Wesleyan theology has its roots in the major themes of the Bible, including the fact that God loves the world, Christ loved the church, Jesus demands total love to God and neighbor, the ethics of Christian life is summed up in love, and a right relationship with God is one based upon love.<br /><br />The bulk of the work consists of the author's identification of love as the core to central theological doctrines.  Topics addressed include the divine-human interaction, grace, faith, purity and a clean heart, Christian perfection, sanctification.  This statement stands as a summation of Wynkoop's argument: \\"The summarizing word - Wesley's ultimate hermeneutic -- is love.  Every strand of his thought, the warm heart of every doctrine, the passion of every sermon, the test of every claim to Christian grace, was love.  So central is love that to be \\"Wesleyan\\" is to be committed to a theology of love\\" (101).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordrd - Wesley's ultimate hermeneutic -- is love.

His basic task is to relate cultural genesis to natural genesis and understand how value in culture has its links to value in nature.  While Rolston argues for a continuity of culture and biological nature, he also contends that culture exceeds and emerges out of biology, so that genuine novelty occurs.  In fact, Rolston believes that science, ethics and religion are emergent phenomenon in culture.  He uses these three domains \\"for the generating, conserving, and distributing of values as test cases, demanding their incorporation into the larger picture of what is taking place on our planet\\" (xiii).<br /><br />Much of the first third of the book addresses genetic theory, and Rolston surveys a wide variety of literature in this field.  Perhaps one of the strengths of this book is the author's command of the wide literature pertaining to the subjects he addresses.<br /><br />The final third of the book addresses issues related to ethics, love and religion.  Although Rolston affirms value in nature, he does not believe that there is any ethics in nature.  He examines and critiques various biological theories related to egoism and altruism.  In the model he promotes, \\"one needs value naturalized as well as ethics humanized; then ethics will require appropriate respect for value, whether human or non-human\\" (280).<br /><br />Rolston argues that ethics arise out of evolutionary natural history.  It is a history in which values have already been arising.  \\"Such genesis of ethics, distinctive to the human genius, testifies both to human uniqueness, emergent from natural history, and to the creative power evidenced in the spontaneous genetics, the primal source now transcended with the appearance of genuine and universal caring and altruism\\" (280).<br /><br />From ethics emerges religion, and the capacity to be religious evolved within or emerged out of natural systems where there was no such capacity in non-humans.  Rolston advocates a naturalizing of religion, by which he does not mean that religion can be explained away naturalistically.  Rather the naturalizing of religion means that religion is generated by the human confrontation with the forces of nature.  This means that religion comes as a response to prolific Earth.<br /><br />While religion involves more than altruism, Rolston argues that altruism plays an important part in a variety of religious traditions.  Religion functions to generate innovative ethical behavior, which in turn makes possible the human spirit.  This spirit cannot exist outside a social covenant, however.  Religion, then, is an emergent property from complex biodiversity through evolutionary history.  In this emergence, God plays a role.<br /><br />Thomas Jay Oordty in non-humans.

Many Christians know of J.B. Phillips classic book, Your God is Too Small.  But few consider the possibility that their God is too BIG.  When believers zealously attach all the \\"omnis\\" they can imagine to God, perhaps who emerges is not the God of scripture at all.  What seems required is a God neither too small nor too big.<br />Constructing an adequate vision of God is the principal goal for essayists in Searching for an Adequate God.  Of course, as contributor William Hasker remarks, \\"it is our conceptions of God that must be evaluated as adequate or inadequate, not God himself.\\"  Most essayists contend that a concept of God adequate to scripture, tradition, reason, and experience (the Wesleyan quadrilateral) is required or, as Hasker puts it, a conception of God \\"adequate for the faith and life of the Christian church.\\"  Whether explicitly or implicitly stated, both sides consider their own theistic conceptions to be more adequate given these criteria.<br />Given classical free-will theism's ties to evangelicalism and process theism's ties to liberal Christianity, it may seem unlikely to outsiders that the visions entertained by these camps overlap to any degree.  However, even insiders may be surprised to find the large extent to which these visions can be harmonized.  In many ways, Searching for an Adequate God serves as a bridge-builder.  It reveals to the evangelical community that the process vision is more palatable than many had previously thought.  The book also reveals to process theists, who typically run in liberal theological circles, that free-will/openness versions of evangelical theology are more palatable than they had assumed.<br />Tenets pertaining to divine love sit atop the list of convictions shared by these process and classical free-will/openness theists.  Both sides affirm that God is love; God lovingly interacts with the world; God is genuinely affected by give-and-take love with the world; and God's primary, if not exclusive, modus operandi is persuasive love.  Free-will/openness theist Richard Rice comments, \\"Process thought is often described as a metaphysics of love, an attempt to develop a full-fledged metaphysical system from the fundamental insight that God is love.  The open view of God [a.k.a. free-will theism] shares this emphasis upon the priority of love.\\"<br />Consistent with this emphasis upon divine love and love's implications are the emphases by both traditions upon relationality, freedom (e.g., both reject compatiblism and determinism), and the social nature of the God-world relationship.  Additionally, both reject the argument that God can have certain knowledge of the entire future.  Given these emphases, it is understandable that both theological perspectives sharply criticize notions -- which theists derived from classical metaphysics -- portraying God as aloof, impervious, or all-determining.<br />Both process and classical free-will theists affirm that God is providentially active in both human and nonhuman life.  Both process and classical free-will theists hold that God is personal, purposive, and pantemporal.<br />It may surprise some to find that the issue of biblical authority does not arise as a major obstacle in this free-will/openness and process dialogue.  In this volume, the process theists never chide free-will/openness theists for the latter's insistence upon the primary authority of the Bible.  Free-will/openness theists only occasionally scold process theists for failing to appreciate the biblical witness.  In fact, both sides appeal to an interpretation of scripture they believe supports their own theological vision.<br />The leg of the quadrilateral stool on which these theisms seem to differ most is Christian tradition.  For instance, essayist David Griffin considers the tradition's doctrine of creatio ex nihilo indirectly damaging to the claim that God is love. A God able unilaterally to create the world is culpable for failing unilaterally to prevent genuine evil.  He proposes, instead, a doctrine of creation grounded upon divine persuasion, theistic evolution, and a God-initiated Big Bang cosmology.  Free-will/openness theists, however, accept creatio ex nihilo.  For free-will/openness theists, the traditional creation doctrine supports a strong eschatology and explains God's miracle-generating activity.<br />At the heart of their theological differences are the theories of divine power, although each can agree on a formal definition of divine power (e.g., God's power is supreme, and deity possesses all the power it is possible for any being to have).  On one hand, free-will/openness theists contend that God possessed, at least at one time, absolutely all power.  Furthermore, these theists contend that God can unilaterally determine some events or situations -- should God choose to do so.  Free-will/openness essayist Hasker believes that a God who can both unilaterally determine (coerce) and act cooperatively (persuade) is greater, and therefore more adequate, than the God who only acts persuasively.  Process theist Griffin, on the other hand, avers that God never possesses a monopoly on power, which means that God never entirely determines an outcome.  Griffin contends that the problem of evil, among other problems, remains insoluble for theists who believe God that is able to determine unilaterally.<br />Many of the essayists share fascinating autobiographical material.  Nancy Howell, Wheeler, and Rice disclose how, in their own journeys, they embraced or rejected various aspects of process and evangelical traditions.  For Wheeler, to cite one, the evangelical faith of his youth and the process theism he discovered in graduate school are not mutually exclusive.  To varying degrees, these scholars live inside, outside, and/or between theological traditions.  To use Howell's image, these authors maneuver among theological boundaries.<br />Conceiving of a \\"right-sized\\" God truly matters.

The ground for the book is \\"a conviction that a magnificent intellectual content is implicit in the religious faith most briefly expressed into three words, `God is love,' which words I sincerely believe are contradicted as truly as they are embodied in the best known of the older theologies, as they certainly have been misunderstood by atheists and skeptics\\" (ix).<br />Hartshorne offers a solution to the problem of evil that is based upon a notion of divine power that is in harmony with creaturely power.  \\"In their ultimate individuality things can only be influenced, they cannot be surely coerced\\" (xvi).  Hartshorne's understanding of God as both absolute and relative provides a fundamental thesis for process theology's doctrine of God.  In some respects, God is unchanging; in some respects, God changes.  Because God is unchanging love, God's experiencing of love and gift of love must change in moment by moment existence.<br />Hartshorne's understanding of love plays a pivotal role in the development of the book's themes.  He argues that \\"love is the desire for the good of others, ideally all others\\" (14).  Divine love includes social awareness and action from that awareness.  It includes both selfish and unselfish acts by God.  \\"In God there is a perfect agreement between altruism and egoism\\" (161).  He argues that theologians went through many contortions to show that God's love both was love and nothing of the kind.  \\"They sought to maintain a distinction between love as desire, with an element of possible gain or loss to the self, and love as purely altruistic benevolence; or again between sensuous and spiritual love, eros and agape.  But benevolence is a form of desire\\" (116).<br />\\"The whole idea of religion,\\" says Hartshorne, \\"is that we can know God as He is in Himself, though vaguely, for we know Him through love.  We know ourselves and everything else in relation to a dim but direct sense of God's love.  Love of God is the norm of creaturely love; for religion, all other human love is deficient\\" (127).  In words sound poetic but that Hartshorne takes seriously, he writes, \\"the divine as love is the only theme adequate to the cosmic symphony\\" (216).ove.

Given that process thought has proven especially helpful for many in the science and religion dialogue, one would do well to mine the chapters of The Spirit and the Forms of Love for gems to orient one's work in the interface between science and theology.<br /><br />Williams reveals his purpose for writing The Spirit and the Forms of Love as his attempt to answer the question, \\"What is the meaning and truth of the Christian assertions that God is love, that love to God and the neighbor are the two great commandments, that fulfillment of human love depends upon God's action of reconciliation, and that the love of God is the ground of all hope?\\" (vii)  When beginning to answer these questions, Williams turns to Christian scriptures.  Although expressions of love in the Old Testament are diverse, Williams contends that the meaning of love therein is nothing other than the meaning of God's historical dealing with humanity. According to Williams, what Christians mean by love grows out of Jesus' history.<br />Williams offers three typologies to illustrate three major forms of love in the Christian tradition.  The first is the Augustinian synthesis of the New Testament faith and the Neo-platonic vision.  Its characteristic is the attempt to bring the various human and divine loves into an ordered structure.  The second type is the Franciscan, which is expressed in the free, radical expression of love in a sacrificial life.  The third type is the Evangelical way, which centers upon two notions: (1) the loves of God and humans are to be understood within the affirmation of salvation by grace alone, and (2) grace gives the individual a new sense of vocation to be a servant of God in the secular order.<br />Neo-Platonic metaphysics have unfortunately often undermined Christian attempts to conceptualize Christian love adequately.  When the main structure of Christian theology was formulated in the creeds, \\"the biblical faith in God became fused with the Neo-platonic doctrine of God as absolute being\\" (17). When Augustine sought to combine the biblical vision with Neo-platonic metaphysics, he ascribed to God all power and perfection (as completeness).  This meant that temporality, change, becoming, and passivity were be ascribed to God.  Neo-Platonic metaphysics denies the possibility that human determinations can alter God's experience, and the notion that God's experience is unalterable contradicts the broad biblical witness of God's interacting love.<br />\\"What would it mean,\\" Williams wonders rhetorically as he transitions to proposing a process metaphysics to replace Neo-Platonism, \\"to relate the Christian doctrine of God to a metaphysical outlook in which God's being is conceived in dynamic temporal terms?\\"(9)  It would mean something very different - something more intelligible and biblical.<br />The \\"process\\" in process metaphysics designates this thought's indebtedness to a broad movement in modern thought that reconsiders metaphysical problems based on an evolutionary world-view and the temporal flow of experience.  Williams avers that contemporary humanity is conscious of its radical historicity involving real freedom, possibilities yet unrealized, and an open-ended future that humans shape partly by their own decisions.  Because of this and because the biblical God acts in a history where individuals have freedom, a philosophy should be championed that corresponds with general science, conceives of God in historical-temporal terms, and also accounts for creaturely freedom.<br />In broad terms, Williams defines process theology as a perspective supposing that God is joined with the world in the adventure of real history where God and creatures have freedom to act and respond.  Crucial to Williams's work is his insistence that similarities must exist between divine and human love.  The analysis Williams performs is based upon this hypothesis: Whatever is present in the inescapable structures of human experience must be present in ultimate reality.  After coming to a working hypothesis that accounts for the elements of those inescapable structures of experience -- particularly the experience of love, one then asks about the implications this account has for a doctrine of God.<br />What, asks Williams, are the ontological conditions that human love requires and how are these conditions reflected in divine love?  He suggests three conditions.  First, individuals must be in relation.  Love requires (1) that real individuals each bring to relationship something that no other can bring and (2) that those individuals possess the capacity to take into account another's unique individuality.<br />Second, love requires a degree of freedom in the one loving.  All loves and lovers have a historical context and thus absolute freedom is impossible.  Freedom is always qualified by the physical, emotional, and historical circumstances in which love exists.  Furthermore, contends Williams, the very nature of love includes affirming and accepting the freedom of the other.  \\"Nothing is more pathetic than the attempt to compel or coerce the love of another, for it carries self-defeat within it.  That which is coerced cannot be love, hence in love we will that the other give his love freely\\" (116).  If God wills to love, and, above all, if God wills to be loved, God cannot entirely determine the love of the other.  God gives freedom to creatures in order that they may love.<br />Third, what has been said about freedom, action, suffering, and communication, implies the categorical condition Williams calls \\"causality.\\"  According to him, love is meaningless without causality.  Love \\"must be the kind of action, with whatever coercion is involved, which so far as possible leaves the other more free to respond\\" (120).<br />Fourth and finally, love requires that individuals - including the divine individual -- be related.  Loving not only requires a movement toward the other but also, says Williams, the capacity to be acted upon.  Suffering is the language of feeling and of caring, and that is its importance for love. When humans love, then, they are a part of a history in which suffering is one condition of relationship.  Divine love includes God \\"making himself vulnerable to receive into his being what the world does in its freedom,\\" argues Williams, \\"and to respond to the world's actions.  Process thought offers \\"a new metaphysical vision that embodies the conception of God as living, creative, and responsive to the world\\" (17).<br />The final chapters of the book are given to addressing particular issues that emerge in relation to the love scheme Williams proposes.

Meilaender notes that at one time philia, rather than agape or charity, was the common way to understand love.  However, agape displaced philia in Christian thought, and the author attempts to think theologically about this displacement in this book.  Friendship examines the tension between philia and agape and probes the significance of this tension for Christian thought experience.<br />Each chapter explores a way in which philia, as a preferential bond, is important for understanding theological ethics.  While agape is to be shown even to the enemy, philia is a mutual bond marked by inner reciprocities.  While agape is said to be characterized by the fidelity and changelessness of God in covenant, philia is recognized to be the subject of change.  While agape has been used to designate the search for a suprahistorical resting place in God, philia is the noblest thing aspired to in civics.  While agape understands one's vocation as the supremely important form of service to neighbor, philia emphasizes the bond of relationship toward those with personal significance.<br />In all of these contrasts, the author notes that the central element in their tension is the preferential character of friendship.  \\"Whatever its dangers, friendship is surely a bond of great significance for human life.  No adequate theological ethic can fail to make place for it.  When Christ came into this world, he came to his own, John's Gospel tells us.  And the divine love which Christ displays -- God' agape -- cannot therefore be entirely alien to the needs and possibilities of our human nature\\" (105).	2003-01-06

Among the central figures that he discusses are M. C. D'Arcy, Gerard Gilleman, Soren Kierkegaard, Reinhold Niebuhr, Anders Nygren, and Paul Ramsey.  This work is still one of the very best because of its rigorous analysis of love issues.<br />Outka is not so much interested in offering his own proposals about how best to understand agape, nor is he interested in proposing a particular theological scheme.  Rather, Outka analyzes prominent texts with an eye toward how their authors understand agape as ethics.  \\"I am convinced that many of the historic ethical concerns of the Judeo-Christian tradition have been encapsulated in the `love language,' and one ought to try to understand more clearly just what has been meant within that language\\" (5).<br />Early on, Outka addresses what love as a normative, ethical principal or standard means.  His concentration is upon how one's understanding of agape affects how one understands neighbor-love.  Outka contends that crucial aspects of agape include the fact that agape is independent and unalterable.  \\"Regard is for every person qua human existent, to be distinguished from those special traits, actions, etc., which distinguish particular personalities from each other\\" (9).  Furthermore, Outka contends that agape entails a basic equality whereby one's neighbors' well-being is as valuable as another's neighbor's well-being.<br />In chapters two and three, Outka addresses how various authors understand agape as related to loving oneself and to acting for justice.  Chapter four engages how agape is related to various dominant ethical schemes and what Outka calls \\"subsidiary rules.\\"  The author notes that almost all of the authors do not equate agape with a particular given moral code.  Chapter five includes the author's assessment of how agape might be understood as a virtue or aspect of one's character.  Chapter six entails an examination of how various authors justify or support their contention that persons ought to love with agape.  In other words, these are justifying reasons for why someone might regard others with equal-regard.  In the seventh chapter, Outka pays particular attention to the claims of Karl Barth with regard to agape.  He notes that Barth understands agape as both equal-regard and-self sacrifice.  Outka then addresses how Barth understands the major themes examined in the book's previous chapters.<br />In the book's final chapter, Outka explores various issues that have arisen in his examination of dominant texts on agape.  He proposes what he believes to be the fundamental content of human agape and some unresolved issues related to that content.  \\"The meaning ascribed in the literature to love, in general, and to agape, in particular, is often characterized by both variance and ambiguity\\" (257-258).  This has to do, says Outka, with the particular wider beliefs and theological schemes espoused by the writers of the love literature.  It also has to do with the many ways in which the word love is used in the English language.<br />Upon reflecting on the matters that have arisen in his examination of love texts, Outka comes to a tentative suggestion for the meaning of agape as \\"an active concern for the neighbor's well-being, which is somehow independent of particular actions of the other\\" (260).  This means in part that the human must not let disparities and inequalities determine his or her basic attitudes towards others amongst others with whom he or she interacts.<br />Outka also notes that various problems arise when one understands self-sacrifice as the quintessence of agape.  \\"Generally, therefore, I am inclined to think that instead of appraising self-sacrifice as the purest and most perfect manifestation of agape, the difficulties I have considered are voided if one allows it only instrumental warrant\\" (278).  Regard ofone's self ought to be based upon the fact that he or she is a creature of God who is more than a means to some other end.  Outka also notes that agape involves certain social and personal relations thus entailing an overlap between regard of others and social cooperation.rd of one's self ought to be based upon the fact that he or she is a creature of God who is more than a means to some other end.

He examines four main types of love, with special concentration on two types of love he calls \\"Gift-love\\" and \\"Need-love.\\"<br /><br />Early in the book, Lewis identifies the humblest and most widely diffused of the loves, that is, the loves and likings at the sub-human level.  Following an examination of sub-human love, he addresses a love that he calls \\"affection.\\"  Affection comes from the Greek love word storge.<br /><br />The third chapter is devoted to friendship love, from the Greek work philia.  This friendship love is the least of the natural loves, \\"the least instinctive organic, biological, gregarious, and necessary\\" (58).  Friendship should be distinguished from community love, because communities require cooperation.  Friendship love by contrast is free from instinct, free from duty, and free from the need to be needed.  Following an examination of friendship, Lewis addresses eros.  By eros Lewis refers to \\"the love in which lovers are in,\\" i.e., romantic love.<br /><br />In the book's final chapter Lewis addresses charity.  Charity is `Gift-love' and the primal `Gift-love' comes from the divine energy. While Lewis claims that \\"to love at all is to be vulnerable\\" (121), he also claims that God is self-sufficient.  \\"In God there is no hunger that needs to be filled, only plenteousness that desires to give.  The doctrine that God was under no necessity to create is not a piece of dry scholastic speculation.  It is essential\\" (126).  Also, \\"God, who needs nothing, loves into existence, holy, superfluous creatures in order that He may love and perfect them\\" (127).<br /><br />After God loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures, God implants in those creatures both Gift-loves and Need-loves.  Gift-love comes by grace and we call it charity.  God also gives a supernatural Need-love of God and a supernatural Need-love of other creatures.  It is through these two gifts that creatures have a longing for God and a love for others.two gifts that creatures have a longing for God and a love for others.	2003-01-06

He further argues that this medieval notion of romantic love cannot form a proper basis for Christian marriage.<br />The author traces the tradition of courtly love from the 12th century through the 19th century to modern day.  He begins with the legend of Tristan and Isolde and notes the inescapable conflict between passion and marriage.  Passion is grounded in an eros that is often spoken of by the poets.  Such eros is implicitly selfish and finds its only consummation in death, which means that romantic love includes an unconscious death wish.<br />The selfishness of passion is at odds with the mature agape love found in Christian marriage.  The author claims that his underlying belief is a phrase from Heraclitus, \\"opposites cooperate, and from their struggle emerges the most beautiful harmony.\\"  DeRougemont does not argue that passion should be eliminated from marriage; rather marriage cannot be founded upon passionate love alone.	2003-01-06

It is in this book that he famously defines love as \\"the drive toward the unity of the separated\\" (25).  He also refers to love as the moving power of life and believes all love includes qualities of eros and agape.<br />Tillich does not believe that one can speak of self-love in anything more than a metaphorical sense.  After all, if love is the drive toward the reunion of the separated, it is difficult to speak meaningfully of self-love.<br />In his exposition of the nature of power Tillich notes that love is the foundation, not the negation, of power.  Love is the ultimate principle of justice, although justice preserves what love unites.  \\"The basic assertion about the relation of God to love, power and justice is made, if one says that God is Being-itself\\" (109).

Martin argues that love encompasses a wide variety of virtue-structured ways in which persons value each other as having irreplaceable worth.  In short, love is \\"a virtue-structured way to value persons\\" (1).<br />Although there are a variety of loves, Martin chooses to examine erotic love, defined as love involving sexual desires and monogamous marriage.  By marriage, he means moral relationships involving sexual desires and long-term commitments to one's partner.  His purpose in writing the book is to clarify the role of moral values in understanding this kind of love.  This is a book that provides internal justification for marital love by examining the moral dimensions of love that make it desirable insofar as love's virtues are imbedded in marriage.<br />The book is divided into ten chapters, each of which, except the first, addresses particular virtues of love.  The first chapter, \\"Love and Morality,\\" is one of the most important, because it frames the issues that the author highlights throughout the remainder of the work.  Martin argues that love is internally related to morality: \\"Moral values define love as ways to value persons\\" (10).  The notion of morality that he proposes is pluralistic insofar as Martin realizes that people have differing conceptions of moral ideals of goodness.  These moral values enter into the very meaning of love by structuring love's relationships and shaping its experiences.  In short, virtues and ideals enter into defining what love is.<br />Martin believes that moral philosophies and prominent ethical theories have failed to give love its proper place.  Those moral theories that presuppose an impartiality paradigm give little attention to the preferential treatment that love often calls for.  In proposing his own moral philosophy, Martin affirms an ethical pluralism that acknowledges objective value, affirms liberty and tolerance of diversity, and underscores the moral significance of personal caring relationships.  \\"Love encompasses a variety of virtue-guided and virtue-structured ways to value persons.  Understood within a pluralistic perspective, love makes possible morally creative forms of shared caring\\" (31).<br />In examining the particular virtues that shape and partly define love, Martin begins with the virtue of caring.  According to him, caring is the central virtue that defines love.  It is central partly when it has good motives and intended objects, partly because it tends to produce good consequences, and partly because of its connections with other virtues.  The object of genuine love is the well-being of the beloved together with the shared well-being of two lovers.  This means that love that interweaves altruism and self-interest; in fact, Martin claims that it fuses them.  \\"Love transcends the dichotomy between eros and agape by creating motives to promote the shared good of two or more people\\" (39).  The caring involved in genuine love is \\"directed toward persons in their full individuality, motivated in part by a concern for their well-being intending with any luck to produce good consequences\\" (42).  Caring is expressed in, conditioned on, enhanced or limited by, and in general interwoven with other virtues within a complex moral tapestry\\" (42).<br />For the remainder of the book, Martin examines by chapter the following virtues: faithfulness, sexual fidelity, respect, fairness, honesty, wisdom, courage and gratitude.  Regarding the virtue of fairness, Martin argues that neither mutual consent nor 50-50 distribution of benefits and burdens is adequate for understanding fairness in terms of love.  Instead, Martin advocates the idea of equal autonomy as the primary love criterion of fairness.  Martin notes, however, that \\"although love is never entirely selfless, love includes a willingness to make sacrifices onbehalf of one's spouse\\" (116).  Love intertwines the good of two people.  Love contains elements of benevolence without being a disinterested altruism: it blends the self-interest of two persons so as to transcend the distinction between selflessness and selfishness.<br />With regards to the virtue of wisdom, Martin argues that wisdom is primarily understanding what love is, including love's requirements, constituent values, and contributions to meaningful life.  Wisdom is \\"knowing how to care for the person we love and putting that knowledge into practice\\" (147).  \\"Knowing how to love implies knowing how to be honest, how to be faithful by establishing mutual commitment and arrangements reasonably designed to protect love, how to find the courage to confront dangers to relationships, how to be fair in balancing benefits and burdens, how to show gratitude for love\\" (148).  In sum, Martin's book is a top-notch book of moral philosophy concentrating upon love as the uniquely important touchstone for virtue ethics.ces on behalf of one's spouse\\" (116).

US	34883430	R3LSFXBQWTIRH0	0226610780	925532407	Agape and Eros	Books	4	60	62	N	Y	The Father of Contemporary Agape Scholarship	Anders Nygren's mid-twentieth century work, Agape and Eros, is monumentally important for the contemporary dialogue between science and theologies of love.  When examining Nygren's hypotheses pertaining to love, Gene Outka concludes, \\"whatever the reader may think of [Agape and Eros], one may justifiably regard this work as the beginning of the modern treatment of the subject\\" (Agape 1972, 1).  Nygren's work is not so important for its substantive contributions to this dialogue.  He fails to consider the science of his day, and this work is almost exclusively theological in orientation.  Furthermore, contemporary biblical and theological scholars have been almost uniformly rejected his particular agape and eros love hypotheses.<br />What makes Nygren's tome so important to the current science and theologies of love interface is the book's formal contribution: Agape and Eros implanted on the Western psyche the notion that when the word \\"agape\\" is used to speak of love, we refer to something distinctive.  \\"Agape\\" has come to function as a kind of code word, although to what exactly is being referred varies dramatically from author to author.  Although biblical scholars have almost unanimously rejected the claim that agape holds special status in Christian scripture and tradition, the perceived significance of agape persists today thanks in large part to Agape and Eros.<br />Nygren states that his purpose in authoring the book is \\"to investigate the meaning of Christian love\\" and \\"illustrate the main changes it has undergone in the course of history\\" (27, 39).  Such an investigation is important because love occupies the central place in Christian theology and piety.  Furthermore, if one has access to \\"the distinctive character of the Christian conception of love,\\" says Nygren, the contrasts between it and inauthentic Christian loves will emerge (29).<br />According to Nygren, agape is the only authentically Christian love: \\"nothing but that which bears the impress of agape has a right to be called Christian love\\" (92). \\"Agape is the center of Christianity, the Christian fundamental motif par excellence\\" (48). The other main type of love, eros, is not only non-Christian, it has proven to distort authentic faith whenever Christian theologians have embraced it.  Agape and eros originally had nothing to do with each other, because they belong to two \\"entirely separate spiritual worlds, between which no direct communication is possible\\" (31-32).  In addition, each type of love suggests a different attitude toward life.<br />The author divulges what he means agape when he lists what he believes are this love's essential aspects: 1.  Agape is spontaneous and unmotivated.  2.  Agape is indifferent to value.  3.  Agape is creative. 4. Agape is the initiator of fellowship with God.  The first two features of agape reveal that the explanation for God's love is not found in its object.<br />Divine agape is spontaneous in that it does not look for something that, as Nygren says, could be adduced as its motivation.  By the fact that divine love seeks those who do not deserve it and can lay no claim to it, agape is manifest most clearly in its spontaneous and unmotivated character.  The third feature is, according to Nygren, the deepest reason for agape's uniqueness; it indicates that love is God's creative activity.  Love creates value in the one who is without inherent value.  Fourth, agape, as the initiator of fellowship with God, discloses that God must come to meet humans and offer them fellowship.<br />Having explained what he means by agape, Nygren addresses the meaning of eros.  Although he never gives a firm definition of this love, he identifies it both with the inclination toward the sensual expressed in mystery-piety and with the drive to transcend the sensual that Plato expresses in its highest form.<br />Eros in mystery-piety is the vulgar eros of the sense-world; eros in Plato is the heavenly striving for the transcendent worldof ideas. While Nygren finds no connection between vulgar eros and agape, heavenly eros is agape's chief rival.  In both its vulgar and heavenly versions, however, the agape differs from eros in kind, not degree.  Nygren argues that the negative consequences of Hellenistic thought in general, and eros theology in particular, have invariably led to a distortion of pure, Christian love theology.  \\"When Christianity tried to express itself in Platonic terms,\\" he contends, \\"the agape motif inevitably underwent a transformation\\" (54).<br />Nygren considers how the Christian Church has appropriated the two love motifs in history.  In his view, the history of Christian ideas proceeds in a rhythm, alternating between synthesis and reformation.  A reformation in the history of Christian love occurs whenever agape shatters the synthesis constructed between it and eros.  The two historical figures that illustrate this synthesis and reformation best, according to Nygren, are Augustine and Luther.  Augustine constructed an illegitimate synthesis of agape and eros; Luther's reformation set agape in its proper place as the only authentically Christian love.<br />One of the most important turning points in the history of Christian love occurred in Augustine's thought.  In fact, Augustine's conception of Christian love is the most influential in all of Christian history, according to Nygren, surpassing even the influence of the New Testament.  Augustine's theory of Christian love must be regarded, according Nygren, as a continuation of the endless discussion of ancient philosophy about what is the highest good.  The Christian command to love, according to Augustine, answers philosophy's question of how the highest good can be attained.  This good, which is the eternal, transcendent, self-sufficient eudaemonia, is attained through a complete synthesis of agape and eros.  The meeting of the eros and agape motifs produces a characteristic third love that Augustine calls \\"caritas,\\" which is neither eros nor agape.<br />Augustine's emphasis upon God's unmerited descent to humanity represents the agape element of caritas.  His emphasis upon the necessity of virtue in humanity's ascent to God represents the eros element of caritas.  However, what makes caritas inauthentic Christian love, according to Nygren, is its inclusion of eros as ascent to God.<br />In the latter part of the book, Nygren turns to Luther as the one whose thought reestablishes the correct place of agape in Christian thought; the Protestant Reformation marked a time in history during which true Christian love (agape) was once again rightly elevated.  Luther brought about this correction by smashing Augustine's illegitimate synthesis of eros and agape in the doctrine of caritas.  Several factors were at work in this demolition.  At the center was Luther's personal struggle against the upward tendency of caritas.  This struggle resulted in his rejection of every idea of merit.  He also rejected doctrines that implied the possibility of ascent to God by way of reason or mysticism.  Luther ruthlessly rejected any attempt to ennoble and refine self-love, insisting it be annihilated.<br />Unlike Christian theologians who had come before, says Nygren, Martin Luther insisted upon a purely theocentric love.  In doing this, Luther proclaimed that fellowship with God was possible on the basis of sin, not of holiness.  In this regard, Nygren writes: \\"The deepest difference between Catholicism and Luther can be expressed by the following formula; in Catholicism: fellowship with God is on God's own level, on the basis of holiness; in Luther: fellowship with God is on our level, on the basis of sin.  In Catholicism, it is a question of a fellowship with God motivated by some worth -- produced, it is true, by the infusion of caritas -- to be found in man; in Luther, fellowship with God rests exclusively on God's unmotivated love, justification is the justification of the sinner.<br /> Nygren concludes by emphasizing Luther's belief that humans themselves do not produce Christian love for the neighbor; this love must come down from heaven.  God employs humans as instruments so that, as Nygren says, \\"the Christian is not an independent center of power alongside God\\" (734). Luther thinks of the Christian as a tube that passes love received from above to the neighbor below.  The tube/Christian makes no contribution to the character or shape of this love.  Unlike Augustine's caritas, a love that can only use the neighbor to get to God, Luther's agape love addresses the neighbor as neighbor.  In fact, Luther claims that love for God is none other than love for neighbor.,\\" which is neither eros nor agape. <br />Augustine's emphasis upon God's unmerited descent to humanity represents the agape element of caritas.

Spohn believes that Christianity confesses Jesus Christ to be the definitive but not exclusive revelation of God.  \\"Morally, this confession means that Jesus Christ plays a normative role in Christians' moral reflection.  His story enables us to recognize which features of experience are significant, guides how we act, and forms who we are in the community of faith\\" (2).<br />The first three chapters make the case for the sources and method that the author employs.  The argument is that three particular sources shape Christian ethics: the New Testament, virtue ethics, and spirituality.  The second half of the book addresses how one perceives God's reign and Jesus' compassion vision, as well as exploring the emotions and dispositions of the Christian life.  When explaining the importance of compassion in the ethical vision introduced by Jesus, the author writes, \\"Luke's parable of the Good Samaritan shows that compassion is the optic nerve of the Christian vision\\" (87).<br />The author concludes that the Christian moral life is grounded in the person of Jesus, and this grounding is demonstrated through the regular Christian practices that shape the lives of committed believers.	2003-01-06

Vacek is a Roman Catholic, but his hypotheses and conclusions are not characteristic of most Catholic thought.  The author is well-read and the topics covered are vast.  \\"The central idea of this book is quite simple: (1) God loves us; (2) we love God; (3) we and God form a community; (4) we and God cooperate\\" (xv).<br />Vacek's main contention is that the love of God must be the center of Christian life and theology.  To offer such a theology of love, Vacek undertakes a phenomenological orientation, which pays close attention to human experience.  In particular, the author admits that Christian experience is privileged.<br />Vacek argues that Christians are mistaken to claim that agape is the Christian love.  Rather, contends the author, philia represents the most complete Christian love; philia \\"holds pride of place among Christian loves\\" (xvi).  In fact, Vacek claims that \\"the central thesis of [my] book . . . is that communion or philia is the foundation and goal of Christian life\\" (280).<br />Chapter one argues that a love relation with God implies a distinctively Christian moral life.  This moral life entails certain emotions and values or what Vacek calls \\"orthokardia\\": \\"The ordered affections that unite us with God, ourselves, other people, and the world\\" (5).  It is the Christian's relation with God that makes the Christian life distinctive.<br />The second chapter addresses the nature of love, and he notes that \\"most philosophical and theological writing, when it speaks of `love,' does not analyze what love is, but rather assumes it has an evident meaning\\" (34).  Avoiding this mistake, Vacek defines love as \\"an affective, affirming participation in the goodness of a being (or Being).  Woven into this description are two strands.  Any theory of love has to account for our experience of wanting to be with or have those we love, and delighting when we do so.  Love unites.  A theory of love also must account for our experiences of wanting for the beloved\\" (34 [italics in the original]).  He further defines love as an emotional, affirming participation in the dynamic tendency of an object to realize its fullness.<br />The doctrine of God that Vacek envisions includes a God who is truly related to creation.  The author describes the God-world relation as \\"love-as-participation\\" (95). This means that while God is free to create; God is also bound to that which is created.<br />God's identity is united, but not wholly so, with history.  Humans have autonomy vis-&agrave;-vis God, but their freedom depends upon deity.  Vacek suggests that creaturely cooperation with the activity of God is required for the full expression of love in the world.<br />When addressing the extent and duration of love that should be expressed by lovers, Vacek argues that \\"love tries to enhance the well-being of the beloved, and it does so not only in the short term and for this or that person but in the long run for as many persons\\" (182). However, \\"because God loves not only us but others and also all of creation, we cannot . . . conclude that what God is doing in the world will always be entirely for our good.  Some loss to our own well-being will be necessary\\" (188).<br />In chapters five through nine, Vacek addresses issues typically subsumed under an exploration of three kinds of love: agape, eros, and philia.  He claims that we may love the beloved for the sake of the beloved, for our own sake, or for the sake of the relationship we have with the beloved.  He calls these love relations \\"agape, eros, and philia,\\" which means that he distinguishes each by his phrase \\"for the sake of.\\"  In his chapter, \\"Agape,\\" Vacek gives insightful critiques of the work of both Anders Nygren and Gene Outka.  He argues that agape \\"is centered on the beloved's value and is directed toward the enhancement of that value.  It is a faithful love that is spontaneous, generous, and willing to sacrifice\\" (191).  In later chapters, Vacek also argues for a positive theological case for self-love.<br />In the final two chapters, Vacek addresses issues related to friendship love.  Although his approach to Christian love is a pluralist one in that he affirms the value of both eros and agape, Vacek notes in these chapters his central thesis that \\"communion or philia is the foundation and goal of the Christian life\\" (280).  By philia, he \\"means affectively affirming members of a community for the sake of the communally shared life\\" (287-88).  It is this friendship love that constitutes a mutual relationship with God.  \\"Philia creates, expresses, and enhances a mutual relationship.  philia fulfills us, but that fulfillment is not its primary consideration\\" (311).  Vacek argues that theological focus on agape or eros without philia tends to promote individualism.<br />While duties to strangers are important for the Christian, they are not the paradigm for Christian living.  Instead, Christians begin with the special relationships that they have with those who are near and dear, especially with God.  \\"This book arises the convictions that God relates to us in special relationships, that human selfhood begins in such relations, particularly in the family, and that the fullness of human personhood is possible only through deep philia relationships\\" (312).ent of that value.
