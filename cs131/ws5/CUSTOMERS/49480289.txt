I fully enjoyed the movie Joshua which led me to buy this book on tape. I am glad I have it.  It only cost me a few bucks; but now, these were my disappointments: I thought the movie Joshua had a too propagandic ending and thought that it should have been cut. The book was far worse, and actually on occasion out right interrupted the story line to tell the reader what was right and what was wrong about religion and life in a sermon style. Okay so that was my first big disappointment. Second was: this spun a whole fairy tale world around Joshua that was so outrages I couldn't even believe it for a fairy tale. But I still did and still do enjoy the book just be ware of some propaganda.	2003-05-01

So it's a book with ridiculous action, jokes on  top of corny junks, and crazy idiotic characters all played up to be probably one of the world's funniest bashes on detective fiction.

Only about three action scene occur in the whole book and when I mean action I mean action in like the movement of the arm.  The entire rest of the book is dialogue between all the other characters pointed at you the reader so they can talk you into joining their little group.  The dialogue is so bad it's like something right out of a deer hunting video: \\"And I knew the deer was right over the ridge cause I heard him rubbing.\\"  \\"Yeah, and you knew to move on your heals cause it makes less noise.\\"  \\"Yeah, and I knew that he'd never get my scent cause he was down in the valley and the will blow across.\\"  \\"Yeah, and you know to pull the trigger and not squeeze.\\"  If you want to be converted over to joining the militia buy this text book other wise.

(Especially us Christians)  We might as well say: `For God so Loved the Christians that He gave-&quot;  God loves the world!  This is probably the most dramatic story of God's love ever told outside the Crucifixion.  (And this is also a True story of the supernatural.)  I'm not talking about the fuzzy I'm sitting on a warm spot super natural.  This is a story of angels, heaven, Christ, and even hell (Don't expect the American-Christian hell.)  I think in this story the greatest place Christ's light is shown was in the depths of hell as he reached out even beyond the grave to save not only the souls of those in hell; but the soul of this writer before this writer was actually, literally brought back to life.  Beautiful, beautiful story made me cry!  And I'm a teenage male!!  (It's not easy to make me cry!)	2003-01-20

I leafed through this book and it's beginning was great; everything went down hill after I paid for it. The characters became so old and so clich just like all the other ones I'd read. The heroine has to be the stupidest thing since the first fiction writer ever scratched charcoal on a stone wall. I tell you if girls were easy as she was; it would be good to be a man!!! On top of that all the internal dialogue with the heroine and hero only proves that they are both the stupidest human beings ever to have a brain. They change their minds every single line, and with all the slashing around I get to feeling like I'm in a washing machine!!	2002-12-18

Nothing in it was interesting the main character seemed like every character I had ever seen on TV. Also if your looking for good spy/assassin type action; this book doesn't have it. On I think page three, the hero assassin captures another assassin by putting a gun to his back--//////WRONG!!!!

This book was fast paced and techno, but most of the action lay in dialogue between commanders so that the book could fit twenty battles where most would fit one, and despite the amount of dialogue between commanders I could never get to love the people enough to get emotional over the events. It was rather more like history to me. So and so won a battle, and so and so then got shot in the head because of another so and so's conspiracy, and then the other so and so lost a battle. But if you like books that are techno military without much emotion and with a bird's eye view of a hundred battle scenes buy this book; it's probably Tom Clancy's best. Else wise I would really recommend a book named: Cain by James Byron Huggins.	2002-06-18

First F Paul Wilson's Repair Man Jack series (This is Self Appointed officer of Justice-actually an outlaw in New York City fighting for his own ideals of justice.) If you don't like the dark intensity then try the other side of the spectrum: Sir Arthur Conan Doyal's Sherlock Holmes series.

This book is so loaded that I recommend reading at least sections of this book no matter what type of writing you are into, but if you are Horror writer I consider this a must have.  It is so full of tips, facts, and inspirations on writing.  Even though I said there are good sections for every writer in there I really don't think these strays off the topic of horror much at all, maybe even none.  I think this is probably the second best book I have added to my collection on writing.  The first is probably Self Editing for Fiction Writers if you don't have that I would check that one out.

This was an extremely fun read except in the times the story began to wander.  Then it went down to just fun, but it was still good.  I wouldn't suggest reading it without reading the to books that come before this:  The Tomb, Conspiracies, and Legacies.  Since I am trying to convince you to read others in the series I should define it for you.  These are suspense, science fiction, fantasy, mystery with a very dark element to them.  And a main Character: Repair Man Jack who fixes problems for people usually in an illegal manor.  He has a good heart and really cares for the people he helps, but a violent streak that he is constantly trying to rein in.  The books are very gripping.  Try The Tomb first.	2002-01-16

It seems like a return to the style of some of the classics, but with action sequences that put to shame even modern action.  And as all books should have an immense depth of character.	2002-01-16

The book opened with a really, really dumb action scene; and almost worse, there wasn't another action scene in the next two hundred pages; believe it or not, I still hadn't really gotten to know the characters.  Just read a lot of movement from here to there.  Boring stuff that really should have been summarized in maybe a page or two or a prologue.  I chucked the book aside.	2001-12-24

I am a Christian, but I read almost a hundred percent secular books because most of the Christian stuff just isn't good enough, but this book is another one of the huge exceptions.  Don't let the other reviews confuse you.  This is not really that much about Jesus' blood, but about inner conflict.  I don't want to spoil the story line so I will leave it at that.  The highest point of this book is Characterization.  The characters felt so real I it was like they were really alive, and I was watching their drama.  This is an excellent book.  I would recommend it even if you are of the secular audience.	2001-12-24

I really wanted to learn how to write descriptively; I got this book, tried to read it, and nearly got bored to death.  It said virtually nothing, in all the pages I read.  Then I got a book called Word Painting, and I could hardly put it down.  That has so helped me in my writing, and I would highly recommend that one.	2001-12-11

Although this story had it's weak spots I could not call the story weak.  The nightmarish drama and mystery in this book was much more than enough to keep me reading like crazy and looking into the shadows.  The book is truly a shocker in it's dynamic plot.  I think it was one of the most amazing peices of literature out there and my favorite book.	2001-12-09

This book was captivating from like the moment I picked it up.  I read through page after page loving it.  I think the best part is how real everything feels.  How you get drawn right into the main character, Jack.  Until it is like you become him walking down the streets of New York city.  This man is not a super hero.  It's like he has like flesh, blood, heart, and soul like us.  Read it.  <BR>Aside from his incredibly dynamic characters it also has an excellent plot that kept me guessing a lot.  And got me buying up the Repair Man Jack series.	2001-12-09

This is not one of Frank Peretti's typical Block Buster Christian fiction, but more of a story that is written to work out his own inner questions on Christianity.  What it should mean.  And what it does mean.  It still has it's high points as a thriller though.  I recommend this to any Christian espcially anyone who wants to have everything they ever believed in challenged as Frank Peretti takes each denomination apart peice by peice with some of the most humorous theological comedy.	2001-12-03

If you want a writing book and don't have that one buy it!  Then if you still need more you might want to try this one.  This is a moderately paced book.  I would say better than the average how to write book, but I find that many writers, editors, and myself do disagree with some of the thing he advocates, but even when I believe he is wrong I have often found inspirational ideas in what he is saying.	2001-11-29

I like to keep it in arms reach whenever I am writing.  The book is extremely fast paced and no nonsense.  It covers just about every element of fiction writing in detail.  Where most books take a chapter to cover a point I find it covers it better in about two lines.  It simply amazes me.  I would recommend this book even to a best selling author.  Some of it's ideas are simply so revolutionary.	2001-11-29

But, Fank Peretti, &quot;The Father of Blockbuster Christian Fiction&quot; knows how to deliver a real thriller and still make I Christian!

In my opinion, this is not one of Frank Peretti's Blockbuster fiction; but it is an excellent portrayal of his own deep inner questions about our faith in Christ, but still his its high points for blockbuster fiction too!  I think though the best part of it is its humors look at the church and it's hypocrisy and what the real church should be.  &quot;Christian&quot;  Christ Like.  And reach out into the world to save the world no mater how much trouble it causes like Christ!!  I think it is one of the funniest, funniest, and most instructive documentary/novel on Christianity in the modern world and its huge short comings.  And it is good fiction too!!	2001-06-11

In many elements of his books I and I believe the rest of the readers can't tell what will happen next.  I think that should be attributed to his book's deep grasp in reality not starry fantasy.  <br />In so many other books, so many times I know everyone will live through all everything, and I am disgusted because I can see straight through the plot and no matter how many twists I know they will make it.  Huggins is so different: in lots of his books guys died that I didn't want to die or didn't expect to at that time.  <br />He is really good and I love his firm grasp of the reality of it all.  The treachery and brutality of war and death and politics.  The total misery sometimes something we need to understand not the glorification of this that has no glory.  But then, I think the best part, he also lays down the beauty of what is done.  The beauty of a life given for the life of another, the death of someone for his friend.  True Love.  <br />I should admit I don't think he is one of the most gripping authors, but I do think he is the most thrilling author ever!  Sometimes I think he is just a little slow getting into it.<br />Oh and one more really cool thing is his in depth knowledge of tactics and battle.  I think it is really great to listen to it all!<br />I think all Huggins books are totally epic.  On top of being, I think, the best horror-thrillers on the market! And I hope that they out live this age and become some of the classics of this century.	2001-02-12

Most everyone else here basically out lined the story so there is no point in repeating myself here!  I just wanted to comment because this book was excellent, and I think everyone who likes reading novels should read this book!  It was incredible!  It had amazing action and the characters in there all seemed so real.  It was very, very good!  Definitely the best book I had read so far!  I am reading though another book called the Hunter again written by Huggins and it does have the makings of being better than Cain!  I don't know I might like that better when I finish it, but I would definitely recommend reading all of his books!	2000-09-23
