REBT while very practical pretends that what you ahve gone thrue, you personal history is of very little importance and what matters only is the here adn now.  IT has a high emphasis on rationality.  Big problem, most human beigns aren't pure rationalists, if they were there wouldn't there woulnd't be any problems in the first place.  Besides cutting out the heart from life and depending on pure rationalism is cutting yourself off from real life.	2004-03-28

And yes Islam just like any religion can be either tolerant or very oppressive depending on the believers interpretations.  The reader/reviewer who gave one star wishes to imply that there is no tolerance in Islam and that it is just a violent religion.  What childish notions, believers of all relgions have oppressed minorities and forcibly converted them.  This is not an accusation that can only be leveled at just Muslims, but to all followers of any religion.  Ther is ample evidence that shows contrary to popular belief Islam was NOT spread by the sword.	2004-03-27
