WHIRLWIND AFFAIR features Lord Robert Jamison as the hero and Elizabeth's childhood friend, Alberta (Allie) as the heroine in a humorous romantic mystery of the first order!<br />We first encounter the widow, Mrs. Alberta Brown, as her ship the Seaward Lady is docking in London after a three-month voyage from America.  During the voyage, Allie experienced a number of \\"accidents\\", and although she doesn't know why anyone would want to harm her, she has some suspicions that they were not accidents but that she was deliberately pushed down the stairs, pushed overboard and poisoned.<br />Allie made the trip to England for a six week visit at Bradford Hall the home of her friend, Elizabeth, who is expecting her second child. But before Allie goes to Bradford Hall she plans to conclude personal business that involves her deceased husband's hidden life of crime, blackmail and thievery.  She discovered her late husband's criminal deeds only after he was killed in a duel three years before.   By selling everything she owned and living in near poverty she repaid all the people her husband had robbed.  There remains one item to return to its rightful owner and that is a coat of arms ring, which she believes is from England.<BR> <BR>Elizabeth gave Lord Robert a sketch of her friend and asked that he meet her at the dock and escort her to Bradford Hall.  Lord Robert is quite taken with the beautiful laughing woman in the sketch, but when he meets Mrs. Alberta Brown she bears little resemblance to that woman.  While in London, and staying at the Duke's townhouse, Alberta is abducted, the townhouse is burglarized several times and Lord Robert, Alberta and the Duke's household staff are in danger.  Lord Robert, who is completely enchanted by the beautiful widow,vows to protect her and see her safely to Bradford Hall.  However, he is quite sure that Mrs. Brown knows more then she is telling him about the series of crimes that have taken place since she arrived in London.   Although he suspects there are secrets in her past, it does not stop him from being passionately attracted to her and aware of her attraction toward him.  Alberta continues to wear black mourning dresses three years after the death of her husband.  Lord Robert, of course, believes the reason for her extended mourning is her great love for her deceased husband, David, when in reality Alberta continues to wear black to keep away prospective suitors.  Alberta has sworn she will never marry again and does not trust any man. But the passionate tension and attraction continues to build between them and as they finally arrive at Bradford Hall, Alberta suggests to Lord Robert that perhaps they might have an affair rather then plan on anything more \\"permanent\\".  <br />The combination of mystery, danger, humor and blossoming romance (to say nothing of the heated passion between these two characters) keeps the reader riveted until the last page.  This is Regency Romance at it's very best and I highly recommend WHIRLWIND AFFAIR to anyone who enjoys historical romances.	2002-12-01

Unknown to the murderer, a young homeless woman was waiting in the shadows of the church to speak with Fr. Carver and witnessed the murderer's exit from the confessional.  The woman is Nicola (Nick) Jones who is on the run from a mysterious past and who does not wish to be connected with Fr. Carver's murder.  Fr. Carver's twin brother, FBI Special Agent Dane Carver, is working with the local police to find his brothers killer.  Dane personally takes Nick into protective custody when it becomes apparent that someone is trying to kill Nick.  They discover that the killer is using the scripts of a popular television show to commit the murders.  Dane calls in fellow FBI agents, Dillon and Sherlock Savitch to assist him in keeping Nick alive and finding the killer. <br />This is the first Catherine Coulter book I have read.  The story line is good and there are multiple mysteries going on at the same time that kept me interested and guessing until the end.  However, the interaction between the weakly built characters was astoundingly trite.  The dialogue was embarrassingly silly and amateurish.   It remains a toss up as to whether the plot and story line are good enough to offset the characters and the dialogue.	2002-09-19

Movies can often make me cry but books, almost never.  Falling Home managed to reduce me to tears but that is certainly not why I loved this story and it is not my criteria for what constitutes a great book.  But when a book can elicit that kind of emotional response from me it's because the story is well written, it's real and it has heart.  <br />Cassie Madison has spent 15 years in Manhattan building an enviable and powerful career in advertising.  She hadn't spoken to her younger sister, Harriet, in those years since Harriet ran off and married the love of Cassie's life.   During her absence Cassie kept in touch with her father and would meet him in Atlanta for a weekend once a year but refused to return to her hometown of Walton. Cassie believes she has outgrown the small town life and has become a big city snob. The story begins when Cassie must return to Walton after receiving a phone call from her sister with the news that their father is dying.<br />Cassie leaves Manhattan, her job and her fianc√©, Andrew, to return to Walton to see her father for the last time.  After arriving in Walton one of the first people Cassie meets is the town doctor, Dr. Sam Parker, one of her childhood friends.  Sam is no longer the nerdy, goofy kid she knew but has morphed into an incredibly gorgeous hunk and one of the towns most loved and respected citizens.  There are surprises, mysteries, and twists in this book that kept me reading until 4:30 a.m. on more then one night.  I could not put this book down!  There is hardly an emotion that isn't played on in this story about returning home, old hurts and heartbreak, growing up, letting go, learning what is really important in life and finding one's heart.<br />Karen White's first book, In the Shadow of the Moon, convinced me that she is an author whose books I will always look forward to reading and re-reading.  Falling Home contains the excellent character development, story line, twists and turns and emotional depth that Ms. White consistently creates in her work.  Those who read her work will not be disappointed and will ultimately become fans.	2002-08-16

Samantha Briggeham is independent and unconventional (she is often referred to as &quot;eccentric&quot; by those who know her) for any century, but she happens to be living in 1820 when young women often find themselves in arranged marriages and being &quot;independent&quot; is not something that is encouraged in a young woman. <br />Samantha's father, Charles Briggeham, believes Major Wilshire is perfect for Samantha and has made the arrangements for her to marry.  Samantha, who enjoys reading and carrying on scientific experiments with her younger brother, Hubert, has other ideas and they do not include being married off to the dour Major Wilshire, who she considers a &quot;tiresome dolt&quot;.  Although Samantha's three younger sisters are married and seem to be happy, Samantha has no desire for the married life especially to a man she does not love.  <br />Samantha decides that since she can't convince her father that she is not suitable marriage material, she will speak to Major Wilshire and convince him.  Samantha's meeting with Major Wilshire is successful and he is quite sure he doesn't want to marry such a &quot;strange&quot; woman.  When Samantha is returning home from her meeting with the Major, she is kidnapped by a masked man on horseback.  The mysterious masked rider is the infamous &quot;Bride Thief&quot; who rescues ladies from arranged and unwanted marriages.   Samantha is terrified, then intrigued, by the mysterious kidnapper and she explains to him that she is no longer in danger of being married off since she had just convinced Major Wilshire that she is completely unsuitable for marriage.   The Bride Thief returns Samantha to her home and news of her adventure spreads rapidly through the social circles making Samantha a much sought after guest at numerous parties.<br />At one of the parties Samantha attends she meets the Earl of Wesley, Eric Landsdowne.  Samantha is very intrigued by the Earl and finds him to be somewhat familiar to her in his mannerisms and speech.  The Earl of Wesley and the Bride Thief are one and the same person.  Samantha is unaware of the earl's secret identify and finds herself inexplicably drawn and attracted to him. Sadly, she feels he is much too good looking and sought after by too many women to be interested in someone like her. <br />Ms. D'Alessandro's books are always filled with witty scenarios and dialog as well as heart warming scenes and this book is no exception to that rule. The Bride Thief is one of the best of Ms. D'Alessandro's books, perhaps the best or at least it's a tie between The Bride Thief and Whirlwind Wedding.  <br />The Bride Thief won't disappoint Jacquie D'Alessandro fans it will only add weight to the conviction that Jacquie D'Alessandro is one of today's hot regency romance writers!	2002-03-29

The house hasn't been lived in for some time and needs renovation.  Declan finds his joy in restoring the old mansion.  There's a sad history to the mansion, however, and Declan begins to experience strange dreams and starts sleepwalking.  He finds himself terrified to enter one of the rooms on the third floor.   Declan meets Lena, the owner of a small bar in down town New Orleans.  He is immediately attracted to her and thinks, \\"at last\\" the first time he sees her. Lena and Declan are both linked to the history of Manet Hall as well as to each other. Lena's grandmother lives behind Manet Hall and Declan befriends her.  She is a wonderful character.  Declan has a terrific personality and sense of humor. This is definitely one of my favorite Nora Robert's books. Being interested in reincarnation and past lives added to the flavor.  I must admit I was surprised when I discovered what the subject of the book was but I think Ms. Roberts handled it in a believable manner.  Definitely a keeper.	2002-01-14

My only reaction to Patricia Cornwell's &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; is to ask &quot;why did she write this? and why did I read it&quot;?  Certainly I could have done other things with my time.  I continued reading through this truly boring, stupid book only because I kept thinking &quot;it's got to get better&quot;...no, it doesn't.  I am a fan of the Kay Scarpetta novels and listened to one of the Andy Brazil novels on tape and that was so-so but this... If only I had logged onto Amazon and read some of these reviews before I bought this book.  I won't read another one of Patricia Cornwell's novels unless it's a Kay Scarpetta.	2002-01-09

Having read the all the books in the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon, and the Outlandish Companion, I could hardly contain my excitement when The Fiery Cross was finally released.  However, if this had been the first book in the series I would never have read the next four.  <br />It's already been said many times in the other reviews I have read here that the book is slow and plodding so I won't bother.  The biggest annoyance to me was the way a scene or topic was developed up to a point and then dropped.  The next chapter began with something entirely different and I was left hanging wondering what on earth happened.<br />The love between Jamie and Claire is still enchanting but there is no doubt that it has moved on to a different level.  I saw glimpses of the Jamie from the previous novels but he doesn't seem to be the same man he was.  I haven't liked the character Brianna since she was first introduced.  I like her less in The Fiery Cross.  She is a spoiled brat and treats Roger like she doesn't really love him at all.  Roger walks around on eggshells because he's always afraid of making Brianna angry.  Roger's character was developed more in this book and I seem to like him more when he isn't with Brianna.  Unfortunately, Roger seems so intimidated by Jamie that he barely speaks to him or perhaps he's competing with Jamie on some level.<br />Even having said all that I will still read the last installment of this wonderful series and hope that it is more satisfying.	2001-12-23
US	51636151	R397XMQMXSWJPC	0743211383	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Stephen King is Definitely Back	The first Stephen King book I ever read was &quot;It&quot;. The book was among a pile of books brought into the office where I worked and they were all up for grabs. Not being a fan of horror movies, or horror books for that matter, I wondered why I even picked it up. I began reading &quot;It&quot; that night and was not only pleasantly surprised but I was hooked. People who haven't read any of King's books might not realize that he has a kind of dry, wry and somewhat warped sense of humor that makes me laugh out loud. The expressions that his characters use are clever and funny and have a way of letting the reader know more about the character who uses them. King always includes lyrics from some old rock and roll songs in his books. &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is no exception. The Rolling Stones song &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; has a part in the book and one of the main characters, Henry Devlin, has a fixation on the lyric, &quot;Hello darkness my old friend...&quot; from another oldie.<br />&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is the story of four childhood friends who grew up in Derry, Maine. Henry, Beaver, Jonesy and Pete. As teenagers the four boys happened upon Duddits, a Down syndrome boy, who is being cruelly taunted by a group of older boys. The four pals come to the rescue of Duddits chasing off the bullies in an amazing show of courage and toughness that surprises even them. They immediately like Duddits and the five become friends. After saving Duddits, who is a dreamcatcher, the four are telepathically linked.<br />The four friends have continued to stay in touch and they get together yearly to go hunting and stay in Beaver's cabin, Hole in the Wall. Now in their late 30's each is going through life problems. Henry, a psychiatrist, is contemplating suicide (hello darkness my old friend); Beaver, who has always been the group's comedian and entertains with his colorful, creative and funny cursing, is having relationship problems; Pete is over the line into alcoholism; and Jonesy is recovering from hip surgery after being hit by a car. Through Jonesy Stephen King relates to the reader his painful real-life ordeal of being hit by a car and suffering through the recovery.<br />It's on their hunting trip that they encounter the aliens through a man named McCarthy who Jonesy nearly shoots as a bear. McCarthy has been implanted with an alien creature that erupts from his body (I dare not tell from where) and attacks Beaver. Jonesy's mind is invaded by an alien he calls Mr. Gray and he builds himself a mental warehouse storeroom where he hides from the alien. Of course, Mr. Gray knows he's there but he can't get into the storeroom to completely take over Jonesy's mind.<br />Everyone who is exposed to the aliens becomes telepathic and much of the dialog takes place through each characters mind. Since the four friends already experience telepathic communication the alien influence just boosts their powers and they communicate with each other through all their separate trials. <br />&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is a return of the Stephen King we've all become accustomed to reading. It has colorful and vulnerable characters, ferocious aliens, an insane military leader, the love and bonding of childhood friends, a race-to-the-finish story line and a satisfying ending.	2001-09-15

Having just completed the series by Diana Gabaldon, Outlander, and wondering what I would read while waiting for the next book in the series, I decided to read Son of the Morning.<br />Once I read the first few pages I was hooked on this book.  For those of you not familiar with the Outlander series it's a time-travel Scottish romance and Son of the Morning is also a time-travel Scottish romance.  That is where the similarity ends because Linda Howard has written a book that stands on it's own merit.<br />The main character is a woman, Grace St. John, who translates ancient manuscripts for Parrish Sawyer the head of an archaeological foundation.  Grace is currently translating documents from the 14th century concerning a group of monks called the Knights of the Templar and their mysterious treasure.  They were monks but they were also warriors, the best and most fierce warriors in the land.  Thus far Grace has translated enough of the documents to know that King Philip and Pope Clement executed and tortured many of the Knights of the Templar in 1307 to find and gain control of their gold and the legendary treasure.  The Grand Master of the Knights ordains that the best warrior of the Order, Niall of Scotland, will watch over and protect the treasures.  Niall, or Black Niall as he is called, establishes a strong hold in Creag Dhu, a castle in Scotland to hide and protect the treasure and he is known as The Guardian.<br />Grace's life suddenly and violently changes when she witnesses Parrish Sawyer murder her husband Ford and her brother Bryant.  She over hears Sawyer's plan to find and murder her as well to get the documents she is translating.  Grace begins a year of running for her life from Parrish Sawyer and his hired assassins.  While Grace is struggling to survive in the street and hide from her pursuers she knows she must finish translating the documents so she can discover what is in them that Sawyer was willing to kill for.  Grace goes through a major transformation while she is in hiding and struggling to survive.<br />After Grace completes the translation and learns the secret of the documents she knows she must travel back in time to the 14th century to Creag Dhu and Niall of Scotland in order to stop the Foundation from finding the secret treasure and using it for their evil ends.  Since time travel was one of the secret powers of the Knights of the Templar, the documents contained detail instructions on how to travel back in time.<br />I literally could not put this book down.  It's exciting, intriguing and adventurous.  The reader is taken back and forth between the 14th century with Niall and present day with Grace's hair-raising narrow escapes from the killers.<br />I highly recommend Son of the Morning to anyone who enjoys time travel stories, adventure, and romance.

Mooner, the character introduced in the last installment, Hot Six, plays a bigger role in Stephanie's life and he is an amusing character, \\"Dude\\" being about all he contributes to the dialog.  Joe Morelli, hunk cop and Stephanie's love interest, also plays a larger role as he and Stephanie toy with the idea of getting married.  Grandma Mazur and Stephanie's mother enthusiastically encourage the wedding.  Stephanie and her sidekick, Lula, have some amusing escapades especially while riding on a Harley Low Rider Hog. <br />Stephanie is on assignment to bring in an elderly semi retired mob member Eddie DeChooch.  Eddie was caught smuggling cigarettes through Trenton and failed to show for his court appearance.  Lula and Stephanie quickly find out that bringing in the old guy isn't going to be as easy as they thought.  To complicate matters, Mooner and his friend Dougie The Dealer disappear sending Stephanie off trying to track them down and figure out the connection between DeChooch and her two goofy friends.<br />A Plum novel wouldn't be complete without the gorgeous and mysterious Ranger bounty hunter extraordinaire.  Stephanie calls Ranger for help to bring in DeChooch and the heat is turned up on the relationship between Ranger and Stephanie with a very nice surprise at the end of the book that I'm sure readers have been waiting for. <br />The book was a fun read, although Seven Up did not deliver the laugh-out-loud lines and scenarios that previous Plum novels have, it was amusing.  For readers who follow the Stephanie Plum series, this is a must read.  For those who have not read any previous novels in the series, I would suggest starting with the first book, One for the Money and working through all the books in order.  It's worth it, especially Four to Score, which is my favorite Plum novel and had me laughing to tears.	2001-07-07
US	51636151	RE7QW57GOJZCN	044022425X	173145556	The Drums of Autumn	Books	4	18	20	N	N	Drums of Autumn	The fourth in the Outlander series, Drums of Autumn begins in Charleston in 1767 where Claire, Jamie, Fergus and Ian begin a journey to find Jamie's Aunt Jocasta who owns a plantation in North Carolina.  As with the previous three novels in this series, Diana Gabaldon weaves stories within stories creating a rich tale of adventure, suspense and love.  <br />In Drums of Autumn Brianna, Jamie and Claire's daughter travels back in time to find her parents to warn them of disaster in their future.  Brianna found a story in an old newspaper telling of the death of Jamie and Claire Fraser in a house fire.  Roger Wakefield, Brianna's sometime boyfriend, also found the story.  Roger decided not to tell Brianna for fear she would attempt to go back in time to warn her parents.  When Roger learns that Brianna has done exactly that, he follows her through the stones back to 18th century Scotland.    Brianna finds her way to Lollybrach and meets Jenny, Jamie's sister, and Ian and all the children.  This is a wonderful part of the book where the reader can appreciate and feel the amazing connection between past and future, gave me the chills just reading it.<br />Roger eventually catches up with Brianna in the colonies after Roger's most arduous ocean crossing.  I do agree with several of the other reviewers who feel that Brianna's character is a bit weak.  I haven't caught on to, or much liked, Brianna at all since the first introduction of her character.   Brianna does not have the depth or heart that Claire has and comes off as a self-centered child in many ways.  <br />Brianna and Roger each have their own separate adventures and each is intertwined with Jamie and Claire's.  Lord John Grey appears again to play an integral role in Brianna's life.  The character of Lord Grey is one of my favorites as he is a man of honor.  <br />In Drums of Autumn Jamie is not the ferocious warrior, nor the persecuted prisoner; he's a farmer and a builder.  Although it was a relief of sorts not to endure any floggings or near-death misadventures, it seemed as though Jamie was out of his element having been removed from Scotland.  Nonetheless, this book was everything the previous books were in it's own way.  Diana Gabaldon has succeeded in continuing the `love that spans time' between Jamie and Claire and has added more depth to their relationship.  <br />This series is one of the best I have read.  I was overjoyed to discover the 5th in the series, The Fiery Cross, has already been released already so I won't have to wait to continue this engrossing saga.	2001-07-04

I will admit to dragging myself through the first couple hundred pages, however, there were enough interesting and engaging segments in those first chapters to keep the fire of interest alive.<br />The beginning of the book switches back and forth between 1746 in Scotland with Jamie Fraser's post-war life and 1968 in Scotland with Claire, Brianna and Roger Wakefield undertaking the historical search for traces of Jamie Fraser and what might have become of him after the war. <br />Brianna, Jamie's daughter, finds the proof of Jamie's life as a printer in Edinburgh years after the battle at Culloden.  Claire then makes her decision to, once again, step through the Druid stone circle at Craigh na Dun and back into the 18th century to find Jamie.<br />The reunion between Claire and Jamie was everything a reader could ever possibly want in a novel and more.   Ms. Gabaldon anchors the love story with a strong element of believability, regardless of the time-travel aspects of the story.  Claire and Jamie have little time together before being thrown into danger, mystery and mayhem.   Several surprises await the reader with twists and turns that had me commenting a loud to myself!  As the title would indicate, much of the book takes place on a ship as Jamie and Claire are bound for the West Indies in a daring rescue attempt. Several characters from the previous novels reappear, some in ways that are delightful surprises.  Others return in devious deadly plots.<br />Although I have read over 3,000 pages of this story I am not yet tired of it.  The characters of Claire and Jamie are still strong and continue to hold my interest.  This is one of those stories that I do not want to see end for when it does, I will miss Claire and Jamie terribly.  The next book, Drums of Autumn, promises to be perhaps the best of the trilogy.  <br />I most certainlyrecommend this series to readers enjoying adventure, time-travel and romance.  I would, however, recommend beginning with the first book in the series, Outlander, and then reading the second, Dragonfly in Amber.	2001-06-03

The second book of the trilogy (the first book was Outlander) has Claire and Jamie Fraser in France attempting to thwart the efforts of Prince Charles to regain the throne, in an effort to avoid the slaughter that Claire knows will come at Culloden.<br />The book begins when Claire Randall, now a doctor living in America, has returned to Scotland after Frank's death.  She has brought her daughter, Brianna, with her and hopes to find a way to tell her about her real father.  First meeting Brianna, I'm not yet too fond of her.  After all we have experienced with Claire and Jamie, Brianna comes as a bit of a disappointment.  Hopefully in the next book, Voyager, Brianna will become more likeable.<br />It's 1968 and this is Claire's first visit back to Scotland since she and husband Frank visited 22 years before--the time when she walked through a Druid stone circle and into the middle of the 18th century. <br />Claire wants to learn if Jamie was successful in his quest to save his men (the men of Lollybroch) from the slaughter at Culloden where Prince Charles and the Highlanders met the English for the final battle of the war.   It is during the telling of the story to her daughter of her time travel back to 18th century Scotland, that we the readers, experience the story of this second book in the trilogy.  <br />Claire believes that Jamie died at the battle of Culloden and when she accidentally stumbles upon his grave in present day Scotland, she is confused as to why he would be buried so far from the battle field.  That particular scene is most heart wrenching and Ms. Gabaldon, as we have come to know, has the ability to draw the reader into the emotions experienced by the heroine.  <br />There is a new character introduced in this second book, Roger Wakefield, the adopted son of the local pastor of Inverness.  Claire and Frank had met the pastor during their first stay in the small town.  Roger, at that time, was a young boy.  The pastor has recently died and Rogeris in the process of closing up the pastor's house when Claire arrives in Scotland in 1968 and seeks Roger's help to discover what happened to the men of Lollybroch.  Roger's connection to 18th century Scotland will surprise the reader in one of many of the twists and turns in this book.<br />I am totally immersed in this saga of historical Scotland, the timeless connection and passionate love of Claire and Jamie.  This second in the series was as good, if not better, then the first.  I simply can't wait to begin the third book, Voyager, to continue this wonderful story.  It truly captures the imagination and those readers who love time travel, history, courage, daring and mystery will want to read this series of books.	2001-05-10

Trevor's ancestors were from Ardmore but left Ireland many years before never to return. Both Darcy and Trevor believe they are unable to love.  Trevor Magee is in Ireland to build a music theater, which will be part of the Gallagher Pub.    Trevor sees Darcy as a woman caring for nothing but money and a way to travel the world beyond Ardmore and the family pub.  But, aside from her beauty and her arrogance, which fascinates Trevor, he sees a market for her beautiful singing voice. He knows he could make her famous.  Trevor and Darcy have more then their share of upheaval but in the end both admit their love and as they do, Prince Carrick and Lady Gwen are reunited.<br />I was sad to see this beautiful story end but I was satisfied with the outcome.  I wished there were more depth to the ending as far as Carrick and Lady Gwen's reunion, but overall the book was wonderful and a happy ending for all the Gallagher's and their chosen mates.  Nora Robert's never disappoints me.	2001-04-17

Amazingly, this is Karen White's first novel.  I didn't know that until I finished the book and went to her website to write to her and tell her how much I enjoyed \\"In the Shadow of the Moon\\".<br />The book centers on Laura Truitt and a strange lunar eclipse combined with a comet.  Laura travels back to the Civil War era in search of her daughter.  Here she meets Stuart Elliott and his family.  This book kept me enthralled as Laura attempts to blend with the era she finds herself in and at the same time find her way back to the twentieth century.   I had to laugh as Laura stuns and surprises Civil War era men with the independent spunk of a twentieth century woman.  This book is a keeper and I will read it again, which I rarely do.  Readers who enjoy romance, time-travel and edgy excitement will positively love this book!	2001-04-17

I picked up \\"Outlander\\" at a flea market recently.  When I got into the book I was riveted and fell in love with Claire and Jaime.   Claire's travel back to 18th century Scotland opens the reader up to a world of history that is fascinating and intriguing.  The love between Claire and Jaime Fraser is breathtaking and I found myself hoping she never returns to post-war Scotland.  I found that I didn't like Claire's present day husband all that much, especially after meeting Captain Randall in 18th century Scotland, an ancestor of her husband's.  Ms. Gabaldon's characters have such strength of character and courage, enduring the hardships of Scotland in the 18th century, it made me wonder what I ever have to complain about!  I was sorry to see this epic end.  The good news was when I went to amazon.com I found that this was the first of 4 books in the saga!  I order the other 3 books from amazon and I am now reading the second of the series, \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\".  Outlander is a fabulous book about the extraordinary courage of a woman and a romantic love that spans the centuries.  A must read for all lovers of historical, romance and time travel novels!	2001-04-17

Eve Dallas as the NY cop, in futuristic 2059, is tough as ever and satisfies all those who enjoy women who can hold their own in a man's domain.  Roarke is as sexy as ever (and still a billionaire) and in this latest book Eve gets the chance to pay back to Roarke some of the tender loving care he always gives to her.  Each installment of this series adds a new dimension to the relationship between Roarke and Eve as they come up on their first year of marriage.  The budding relationship between McNab and Peabody gets more interesting and while there's more heat going on there, Eve and Feeney (McNab's boss), do everything they can to ignore it.  The main focus of the story, of course, is the case.  Eve is tracking a contract killer that even the FBI hasn't been able to catch for 25 years.  All the in's and out's of the case, Roarke trying to help with his 'unregistered' computer equipment, and a visit from one of Roarke's boyhood friends from Dublin, make &quot;Betrayal in Death&quot; as good, if not better, then all the previous books in this series.	2001-04-17

Robb (Nora Roberts) each story in this series gets better and better.  The story begins when a murder is committed in a high-class strip club.  The victim is an off-duty detective who was working part time as a bartender in the club.<br />Lieutenant Eve Dallas is on the case and she isn't becoming popular with her fellow cops during the investigation.   In this book J. D. Robb has given Roarke, Eve and the other recurring cast of characters (McNab, Peabody, Dr. Mira, Mavis and Summerset) a bit more of a sense of humor.  Some of the lines are LOLer's, which I never expect in a J. D. Robb book.  <br />The strategy used in the book of finding the killer is riveting.  There's a really nasty villain that all readers will love to hate and, of course, Eve and Roarke's relationship just keeps getting better and better.  Eve is developing as a character with more depth, softness and humor.  Of course, we wouldn't want Eve to get too soft since kicking butt is what she is all about.<br />A great read and a terrific addition to this remarkable and entertaining series.	2001-04-14

The steamy relationship between Eve and millionaire Roarke continues to dazzle the reader with Roarke's unending passion and love for Eve.  Eve seems not able to understand why this man is so in love with her, which only adds to the readers enjoyment.<br />If you haven't read the other books in the series do.

The email is from a woman in London, Olivia Fitzdurham, who is a freelance photographer.  Apparently, unbeknown to Olivia, she has accidentally captured on film something that others would prefer not be revealed.  Olivia is being followed and threatened and is writing to Sam Ryan, who also happens to be a copy, about the situation.  Aiden writes back to Olivia, posing as Sam Ryan his neighbor, and encourages her to come to the United States where he will help her.  Aiden meets Olivia at the airport and the chase begins.  Aiden and Olivia both become criminals on the run thanks to Ryan and his partner who set them up and implicate them in a crime.  <br />Ms. Cameron has a tendency to make her heroines rather drab with little confidence in their own appeal; sometimes I find this a bit boring.  Olivia falls into this category and I found myself losing patience with the character.  Olivia reminded me a great deal of \\"Paris Delight\\" Ms. Cameron's heroine in her novel \\"Pure Delights\\".  Be that as it may, I found Glass Houses to be an entertaining read and would recommend it to all Cameron fans	2000-10-25

Having read the latest of Ms. Hoag's murder mysteries it took some getting used to when I began reading this romance novel.  I knew that Tami Hoag wrote romance before she began writing mystery novels, but still it took until chapter 2 before I settled into this book. Then I got lost in the world of Sarah Troyer, a young Amish widow and Dr. Matt Thorne head of the emergency ward in Minneapolis hospital.  Matt is gorgeous, a bachelor and an unrepentant ladies man.  Sarah is beautiful, na√Øve and Amish.  The story begins as Sarah is nursing Matt back to health after he had been beaten and shot during a gang fight in the emergency room.  Sarah works for Matt's sister, Ingrid, who runs a bed and breakfast in the small town where Sarah lives.<br />Ms. Hoag develops the characters and their relationship to their lives, families and each other with grace and her usual talent.  It's a wonderful romance and love story and anyone who has read Nora Roberts work will enjoy it.  If you are looking for Ms. Hoag's latest type of novel (Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust, Guilty as Sin) this is not the same type of book although I would highly recommend it to lovers of romance novels.	2000-10-22

Unfortunately, Dobby's visit causes a number of problems for Harry and his life at the Durselys becomes even worse, if that's possible.<br />Ron Weasley and his two brothers arrive at the Dursleys in a flying car to rescue Harry.  When the school year begins there is a new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, who is an outrageous ego-maniac, a ghost named Moaning Myrtle and the ever-present local bad-guy Draco Malfoy.<br />The theme of this second book is prejudice against \\"mudbloods\\", people who are from Muggle parents and \\"purebloods\\" people who come from wizards and witches.  J.K. Rowling does a superb job of addressing the issue of prejudice while weaving another fascinating mystery for Harry, Hermoine and Ron to solve.<br />This second in the series was every bit as entertaining as the first and I have already started on book 3 as I write this.	2000-10-17

Robb (Nora Roberts) and three other writers (Claire Cross, Dee Holmes and Susan Plunkett) make up the four stories in Silent Night.  I bought the book for the J.D. Robb Midnight in Death story although the other three weren't bad either.  Of course, all the stories were centered on the theme of Christmas and the holidays.<br />A Berry Merry Christmas, by Claire Cross, is about an orphan, Natalie Sinclair and her Uncle Drew.  Natalie wishes for a new mother for Christmas and Holly Berry turns out to be the one to fill that role.   The Unexpected Gift, by Dee Holmes, Sabrina McKay is having her first Christmas after her divorce with her young son.  Her son finds what he thinks is a dead man in the yard but who turns out to be a girlhood boyfriend of Sabrina's, Zach Danforth.  Predictably, they fall in love and have a wonderful Christmas<br />Christmas Promises, by Susan Plunkett, has Jake Rimsa giving his ex-fianc√©e, Marne York, a ride home for Christmas.  Marne has become an of battered women and has changed much from the woman that Jake once knew.  Jake and Marne renew their love and it's better then it had been before as they come to know each other again.<br />Midnight in Death, by J.D. Robb, Eve and Roarke's first Christmas together as husband and wife is interrupted by the discovery of the naked, mutilated body of the judge responsible for convicting serial killer David Palmer.  Since Eve was the officer that brought down David Palmer, her name is on a list of those to be killed.  This was the best story in the book and continues the \\"in Death\\" series with all the characters that are in the full-length books of the series.  Of course, with Roarke's help, Eve finds the escaped murderer and wraps up the case.	2000-10-14

Eve Dallas is investigating the death of a fellow officer to determine whether he was corrupt and whether he was murdered. <br />The investigation gets Eve involved with a satanic cult and a wiccan group. The wiccan element brings more development to Peabody's character and makes Peabody more than just a trainee in this story since Peabody knows a bit about the wiccan practices.<br />As always, Roarke gets involved in the investigation even when Eve doesn't want him to of course.  This book is as good as the other's in this series and they're all great.  If you haven't read the series start with the first book, Naked in Death. <br />Highly recommended!	2000-10-14

Eve discovers that all the victims had assisted Roarke in his quest for vengeance for the murder of a young girl back in Ireland.  The young girl was Somerset's daughter.  Somerset is Roarke's butler and they have been together for many years coming to America together from Ireland.<br />The murderer sends Eve riddles before each murder. And she tortures over each riddle believing that if she can solve the riddle in time she might prevent the murder from happening.<br />Somerset's character is largely developed in this book as he is framed and made to look like the murderer, also implicating Roarke.  Eve decides to take the investigation underground or risk making Roarke look like the prime suspect.<br />Figuring out the murderer was difficult and entertaining.  Another excellent book in the series.	2000-10-14

Also suspect is Mavis's boyfriend, Leonardo, who just happens to be the designer of Dallas's wedding dress. While investigating the murder and digging up the dirt on the fashion world, Dallas discovers that the model (and most of the suspects) are either consuming or dealing a new and illegal youth serum. <br />It's hard to guess the murderer is in this book, the entire mystery is well written by Robb who keeps the reader guessing.<br />Mavis's character is brought out in more depth, and Peabody's character is broadened as well making her Eve's aide.   Roarke and Eve's relationship shows more depth in this book then in the previous books and we learn more about Roarke's background.<br />Read the entire series of these \\"in Death\\" books, start with Naked in Death the first of the series.

Eve discovers that the murderer dresses up as Santa Claus to gain easy entry by the victim.<br />As in the other books in the series, the spicey romance between Eve and Roarke is a pleasant diverstion from murder and mayhem.<br />The book is fast paced and holds the readers interest.

Having read the previous 3 books I was thrilled to find that Goblet of Fire was 734 pages long...knowing it was the last book before the `dry spell' while waiting for Hogwarts year 5 to be released.  After having heard about the Harry Potter books and seen them in the bookstores, I still had not read any of the series because I considered them children's books.  While reading through some of the reviews posted on Amazon.com by one of the Top 500 Reviewers, I read a review of the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.  The woman who wrote the review was an adult and she raved about the book so much I had to satisfy my growing curiosity by buying the book.  I haven't looked back...I've read them all and now, after finishing book 4, am in a state of Harry Potter withdrawal.  This series of books is the best I have read since Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.<br />Goblet of Fire develops more fully some of the main characters in the series, Fred and George Weasley, Hermione Granger and Professor Dumbledore.

I was disappointed in her final decision as to who she would spend the rest of her life with.  Her husband is an egotistical jerk who wants to take all the credit for her success.  I found the book a little confusing they way Ms. Booth spent so much time developing the story of the American sculptor and the English doctor.

The 'guy' turns out to be He, Himself, and the way Joan Brady goes about unfolding the story of how this woman is guided, instructed and helped by God really made me think hard about how I relate to God and how I expect God to manifest in my life.<br />The book is not a heart throb romance, or a gripping murder mystery, and it isn't even that well written.

Highly recommended!<br />NIGHT SHADOW: Deborah O'Roarke, Cilla O'Roarke's sister from Night Shift, has graduated from law school, passed the bar exam and taken a  job as Assistant District Attorney of Urbana.  The hero of the piece is Gage Guthrie whose character bears a striking resemblance to Roarke in Nora Roberts series written as J.D. Robb.  There's also a mystery hero who roams the streets at night, Nemesis, who reminded me a great deal of Batman!  Deborah first encounters the illusive Nemesis when she is attacked one night after visiting a potential witness in a bad part of the city.  The story has twists, turns and many surprises.

Sparks fly between Althea and Colt as she is a `by the books' copy and he is a `no rules apply' kind of guy.

Ms. D'Alessandro has a fantastic sense of humor and amused me  continually through the entire story.<br />The twist of Elizabeth having the  gift of sight is an interesting twist and was used cleverly in this story.   I hope we can look forward to another book about Austin's brother,  Robert.<br />Ms. D'Alessandro's last two books, Kiss the Cook a contemporary  romance and Red Roses Mean Love an historical romance, were both excellent  and highly recommended.  Whirlwind Wedding is better yet and I would  recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance, a good mystery plot and  the added bonus of a good laugh out loud!	2000-09-18

In this latest escapade, she is  searching for her friend and fellow bounty hunter, Ranger, who is also  sought by the police for questioning in the murder of an organized crime  figure.  Stephanie believes Ranger is innocent and if anything, only kills  bad guys. <br />Joe Morelli, hunk cop, is here in all his glory and there's a  surprise at the end, which I hope will be answered in the 7th  book!<br />Stephanie's hysterically funny grandmother has moved in with her.    A cop friend has asked her to dog sit while he goes on vacation, and has no  intention of taking the dog back.  The dog, Bob, as it turns out has a  strange eating problem, he eats everything and anything. There are a couple  scenes involving, ah, dog doo that had me LOL and rolling!  <br />A new  character emerges, Mooner.  Mooner is a chronically stoned guy and very  funny.  He adds considerably to the chuckles in this new Plum mystery.   Other critics have written that Evanovich doesn't write mystery, or that  the plot hasn't changed, etc., etc., etc.   In this dreary day and age  anything that can make me laugh out loud is worth reading, for sure.	2000-09-18

I think  hearing her voice added to the impact of this story.<br />Shirley's past lives  came to her as she made this grueling trek and they were, to me, the meat  of this audio/book.  She once lived along the Camino, and there are two  amazing past life experiences in Lemuria and Atlantis. <br />Shirley's honesty  and courage in telling her story is inspiring.   The reader also gains much  food for thought.  The lessons she learns and fears that she has to conquer  in order to complete the journey.   &quot;Never ask yourself what it is you  fear - instead ask yourself what it is that concerns you. A fear thought,  put out, will return, because all energy returns to the sender. Any energy  always makes a loop until it regains the source. A concern thought will  return also. A that moment discern why you're concerned.&quot;   Certainly  gave me something to think about.<br />I got involved in past life regressions  as a result of reading Shirley's first and second books.  We all have our  own philosophy, of course, and Shirley MacLaine has given voice to another  way of thinking that also needs to be acknowledged in our world.	2000-09-18

Loving nature, she goes to college  majoring in resource science and returns to River's End to open a  naturalist center.<br />Twenty years after the murder, Sam Tanner's parole has  continued to be denied thanks in large large part to the testimony of Frank  Brady and Olivia's aunt, Jamie.

Robb gives us the &quot;In Death&quot; series  of murder mysteries in a futuristic setting.  New York Police Lieutenant  Eve Dalls is tough, hard hitting, and a good cop.  Beneath the hard  exterior there is a woman with compassion for the victims of the crimes she  investigates.  The unlikely romance between Eve and Roarke, a  multi-millionaire who made his millions by not so legal means, is hot,  unpredictable and the stuff that romance novels are a about.  The latest in  the series, &quot;Witness in Death&quot; starts with Eve and Roarke  attending opening night at the New Globe Theater and witnessing a real  murder on the stage.  It's fantastically entertaining, as all the J.D. Robb  books are, and we get to see more of Peabody, Eve's assistant who is such a  great character in her own right.   I started this series a few years ago  with book two and decided I had to read them all!  I acquired all the books  in the series up to that point and started with the first one.  I loved it  even though I had already read the second.  A terrific series I grab each  new book that comes out and devour it.  Highly recommended!	2000-09-17

I have read all of Ms.  Hoag's books starting from way back when she wrote romance novels.  They've  all been excellent.  In the last few years her mystery novels have topped  my list of 'must read' books consistently.  The comradarie that is apparent  between the police detectives in this novel is intense.  The murders are  puzzling and guessing who the murder is will keep you busy when you're not  reading the book.  Another winner, hands down.	2000-09-15

Having started reading Roberts only 3 or 4 years ago,  I hadn't been able to find some of her earlier work.  I was very impressed  with Irish Thoroughbred as a first work.  I thought it was excellent.  The  romance that grows between Adelia Cunnane (Dee), an orphan from Ireland  brought to America by her uncle Padrick, and Travis Grant a rich and  successful horse breeder that her uncle Padrick works for as his trainer,  is engaging, passionate and endearing.  Dee's Irish temper and tomboy  abilities win the heart of the hunky Travis Grant.<br />Irish Rose, the follow  up book to Irish Thoroughbred, is about Dee's cousin Erin McKinnon and  Burke Logan, friend and neighbor to the Grants.<br />The book starts out in  Ireland when Dee and Travis bring their children for a visit with Erin's  family.  Burke has gone along for the trip on Travis's suggestion to look  into buying some thoroughbred horses in Ireland.  Burke offers Erin a job  keeping the books for his ranch in America giving her the opportunity she  has been looking for to leave her small Irish village.  She accepts the  job.  The storyline is a good one as it describes Erins impressions of  America and the lifestyle.  Fascinating as the relationship between these  two strangers grows and the begin to fall in love.  I highly recommend both  of these stories as great reads for Nora Roberts fans.	2000-09-15

Keely, daughter of Adelia and Travis Grant, is every bit as  independent and feisty as her Irish mother and as strongly committed to her  values and honor as her father.  Brian Donnelly is brought to America from  Ireland by Travis Grant to take over the job of horse trainer on his ranch.   Brian and Keely lock horns immediately.  Brian thinks she is a spoiled  princess when actually Keely is a hard worker who has her own business  teaching rich and poor children how to ride. Keely thinks Brian has a chip  on his shoulder. Brian eventually discovers what Keely does and how she  helps children and also mistreated horses and offers to help her.  <br />The  book is entertaining, enjoyable and relaxing to read.  Especially if you've  read the first novel.  In addition to reading Irish Rebel, I'd suggest  getting Nora Roberts Irish Hearts, which contains the first novel, Irish  Thoroughbred and the second novel, Irish Rose all three are great books  you're sure to enjoy.	2000-09-15

Without revealing the end, it was a complete surprise when I  finally read who the murderer/stalker turned out to be.  FBI agent Nick  Buchanan as the hero is the perfect blend of humor, macho and  sensitive...hard to believe.  And Laurant as the intended victim is feisty,  brave and frightened all at the same time.  The romance that grows between  Nick and Laurant is squeezed between the suspense and drama of catching a  killer and has some very humorous moments.  A riveting read, highly  recommended.	2000-09-15

The characters, of  course, are the same but the focus has shifted to Brenna O'Toole that  feisty handy-woman and Shawn Gallagher the dreamer song writer who works at  the Gallaghers family-owned pub as the cook.  The magical legend of the  beautiful ghost that lives in the cottage Shawn now inhabits continues.   But Shawn doesn't see her, Brenna does, and she receives a message from  this beautiful ghost about Shawn's music.  A message she doesn't fully  understand.  Shawn, however, meets and talks with Carrick, prince of the  faeries, who gives him a pearl and some advice that Shawn decides he isn't  going to take.  When Brenna decides to take matters into her own hands and  seduce Shawn, he is completely thrown by this development, even though he  discovers his (previously unknown to him) passion for her.  Shawn finally  recognizes his musical talent and finds someone who is anxious to publish  his work.  The beautiful descriptions of Ireland in the book make you want  to visit this enchanted place and maybe meet a faery there as well.

The names for the kittens,  Gadzooks, Egad, Fiddlesticks, et al... and how they came to be named is  hilarious.  Elizabeth and Austin have a running &quot;language&quot; joke  (she being American, he English) that is funny, true to life and natural.

When following instructions to create a practice application, the code was wrong, it didn't work!  Even the CD-ROM stuff was incorrect. Studying for these cert tests is tough enough without  the added frustration of textbooks proclaiming to be &quot;Study  Guides&quot; that are riddled with gross errors. I ended up using  Microsoft's VB Programmers Guide and the Visual Basic 5.0 online  documentation.  I passed the certification test (hurrah) but certainly NOT  due to any help from this book!  don't people read/edit or review this  stuff?  Doesn't the author check to be sure his code produces the desired  results??	1999-03-22
