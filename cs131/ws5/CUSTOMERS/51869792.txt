US	51869792	R11HZBEMG2D53P	1551665360	524167305	Trust No One	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Not her best	Christiane Heggan's latest novel left me a little disappointed, with more questions than answers.<br />When Julia Bradshaw's ex-husband is found murdered all eyes are turned to Julia. Even though Julia hated her  ex-husband, she didn't kill him. Trying to clear her name, Julia is  introduced to a frail old man with a failing memory who makes a comment  about an Irish Liberation group. This brings the attention of Steve Reyes,  an ex-reporter whose girlfriend was killed by this same group eight years  earlier. The same girlfriend who was also Julia's ex-sister-in-law.<br />Steve  comes to stay with Julia at her Bed and Breakfast and the two go about  trying to solve Paul Bradshaw's murder together. In the meantime, the two  fall in love but keeping secrets from eachother.<br />Although this could have  been a good book, I found that there were too many unanswered questions.  Characters were introduced, but never explained. This isn't Christiane  Heggan's style. I'd much rather recommend Suspicion or Deception	1999-09-01

I've always been a big fan of Nora Roberts but found her last few books have been lacking. Maybe she's got a real bad case of writers block, but it's not the Nora Roberts I know.<br />In 1979 Olivia's beautiful movie star  mother is found murdered and her father is charged with the murder. Being  the only witness, at the age of four Olivia is called to testify. She saw  her father with a bloody pair of scizzors, but blocked everything else out.

Olivia lives with her grandparents in Washington State. Sam  contacts Noah Brady, the son of the man who put Sam in prison, to write a  book about his life. Noah begins the process of investigating the crime and  goes to Washington State to talk to Olivia.<br />Olivia and Noah are strongly  attracted to eachother but Olivia resists as long as she can. The two begin  a frightening investigation into her mothers' death and find that many  things that were believed to be true may in fact not be...	1999-09-01

I've read the original version three times already and couldn't keep my hands off the new version.<br />In 1820 the Duke of Claymore falls for a &quot;nobody&quot; beautiful Whitney Stone.  Realizing that her uncle is turning down every offer, he goes to her father  and pays a fortune to become betrothed to her. Whitney is mortified, she's  already in love with someone else. As Clayton's luck would have it, things  don't work out too well with Whitney's first love and he finds Whitney in  his arms.<br />Oh how I love this book!   This book is so wonderful. The new version has several added  chapters that, while charming, could have been easily left out.	1999-09-01

Bad Moon Rising is my first first book by Donna Julian and I'm sorry to say that I didn't care for it.<br />Five beautiful, blonde women have been murdered, all contestants in the Kansas City Rose Pageant. One woman each  year for five years. The police have been unsucessful finding the killer,  so one of the victim's family calls in a private investigator.<br />When Eric  arrives in Kanas City, he has one goal. Stop a killer. He doesn't expect to  be highly attracted to the Christi Anthony, a dead ringer for all five  murdered women. The two are immediately attracted to eachother and Eric  must protect Christi from a crazed killer.<br />First of all, the story line  seemed interesting. It was not. The characters were boring and  uninteresting. I found myself straying many, many times wishing I could  just get it over with! The number one thing that turned me off from this  book was the chemistry between Eric and Christi. They meet one day (while  at the same time Christi seems to me to be the stupidest woman on the face  of the earth!) and later that evening they are in eachother's arms on the  dance floor. Okay, that's fine. But to know that they are in love that  instant! Come on, they haven't even known eachother 24 hours! Save your  money, there are many, many more great romantic suspense novels out there.	1999-09-01

This book is thriller first, romance secondary, so all you men out there don't shy away.  This book was excellent!<br />As with her previous novels, Night Sins  and Guilty as Sin, this novel has so many twists and turns you feel like  you're on a roller coaster.  Victim Advocate Kate Conlan and Top FBI  Profiler John Quinn create a wonderful couple finding love again and caught  in a terrible triangle of madness.<br />If you're faint at heart, I wouldn't  recommend this book.  But if you love a good thriller, this book is a MUST  READ!	1999-06-09
