This book by Che shows how Fidel Castro's revolutionary movement has always taken the moral high ground, going back to their triumph over hated dictator Batista. Che documents the reasons for this in these articles, many of which were written as the fighting was going on. He discusses the revolutionaries' respect for the peasants and the way the peasants helped to move the revolutionaries toward a deeper understanding of the class forces involved in the Cuban revolution. This made it possible to integrate many peasants into the revolutionary army. Che describes the care that was taken to treat rank and file enemy soldiers well, especially the wounded. His crystal clear writing style and fine sense of humor are based on a total grasp of the situation. This book includes two superb articles on Che, one by his comrade Fidel Castro and another by the editor, Mary-Alice Waters, as well as valuable notes, glossary, chronology, and index.

Nothing could be further from the truth. This book shows that Lenin began a fight against Stalin in the last months of his political activity, before a stroke completely incapacitated him in 1923. The main areas in dispute were relations with oppressed nations, worker-peasant alliance, and the state monopoly of foreign trade. Lenin planned to join forces with Trotsky in this struggle within the communist movement and threatened to break off relations with Stalin. Lenin also argued for effective education so that the working class could truly hold the reins of power, without having to rely on bureaucratic misinformers. Today, when Stalin's heirs have disowned Lenin, a new generation can read Lenin's writings without Stalinist distortions and misinterpretations. This book is a great place to begin an appreciation of the real Lenin. It is a very readable volume, including useful chronology, glossary, and index.	2005-08-31

This little book was written before this transformation but it documents the urgency of one of the central remaining tasks. What must now be completed is \\"seizing the land from the dispossessor,\\" as one of Mandela's close comrades put it. In other words a radical land reform that would open the land to those whose ancestors were forcibly driven from it. Why is the question of land ownership so important in South Africa today? This book explains how the central pillar of apartheid was the expulsion of native farmers from their land. Many did not even have a concept of private ownership, they simply farmed it in common. As Harsch points out, 87% of land became restricted only to whites. The author explains in a very readable way how land-theft was at the very center of the steps that marginalized the Black toilers. A fight for land-reform is necessary in order to build a worker-farmer alliance, the author cogently argues In so doing he affirms one of the chief demands contained in the freedom charter of Mandela's African National Congress-\\"the land must be shared among those who work it.\\" Steve Clark's introduction helps to link Harsch's book to other valuable readings.	2005-07-28

According to Trotsky, the  working class can lead humanity out of its impasse of war and oppression, if it has a tested communist leadership. He puts forward a program for such a leadership to inspire workers with the confidence that as a class we can seize power from the destructive capitalist class. With his strategic sense of history, he paints a picture of the leadership tests that will occur as workers try to defend themselves, against unemployment, inflation, war, or against the secret strikebreaking or fascist gangs of the capitalists. A revolutionary communist party must  prepare for revolutionary times now. Revolutionaries who wait have always failed. This book is totally grounded in Trotsky's experience at the side of Lenin during the Russian Revolution and the early revolutionary years of the Communist International. Among the interesting and very relevant sections is one on how the revolutionary party can guide the working class to achieve unity with farmers, since these two exploited classes are taught to distrust each other under capitalism. As you read this book, you will say to yourself-\\"this is just what we need today!\\"	2005-06-21

He blasts the imperialist powers for using the conflict for their own purposes, for example when the Russian-French-British camp covered up massacres of Turkish Muslims.

Imagine you had never learned to read because in your society there was no electricity hence no lights to read by. This situation had been forced on your society by an imperialist world economic structure, which not only blocked your society from developing an electrical infrastructure but had the audacity to declare that the development of nuclear power must be totally forbidden. Now you know what it feels like to be one of the two billion-almost one-third of the world's population-who are condemned to darkness and underdevelopment. But you would probably not feel like a victim or an unfortunate statistic. You would want to fight back. This book gives a program for revolutionary workers to fight to overcome the divisions between toilers in the developed and undeveloped parts of the world, urban and rural, those with access to modern energy and those without. The book offers a revolutionary program in readable, lucid prose. It is based on a new way of seeing the world that is worthy of those who are willing to fight.

Cannon was the most important of the original American communist leaders-and a great writer to boot. In his easy and colorful style, he focuses on the critical importance of the Russian Revolution for his generation of working class militants. Those who rallied to its banner gave a vital impetus to all later fighters for social change. Among the most valuable lessons are how the communists defended all class-war prisoners, regardless of their adherence to communism, including the story about Big Bill Haywood and the International Labor Defense. Also interesting, is Cannon's appendix on the \\"Negro Question\\" (as it was then known). I'm convinced by his thesis-that the Russian Revolution and the existence of a U.S. communist party had a liberating effect on the Black struggle in the 1920s.	2004-12-23

He points out that capitalism is one of the shortest-lived economic systems. Its transportation to the Western Hemisphere was accomplished only with the introduction of chattel slavery, the destruction of many indigenous peoples, and the imposition of feudal conditions on many others in Latin America. Capitalism has produced good things, also, as well as bad, Novack points out. \\"But the most valuable thing it has produced is the industrial working class,\\" a power that has the potential to end capitalism and its system of minority rule. Novack outlines how leaders emerge in the working class and the role of the individual in history-making. Novack presents complex ideas in a very readable style.

Wrong, as George Novack clearly explains in the pages of this erudite but very readable book. He demystifies the study of humanism and puts it on a scientific, material basis, beginning with our origins as a species in the transforming role of labor. Humanity, Novack explains, is the only species that can make, remake, and change itself-refuting the \\"you can't change human nature\\" cynics. The productive labor of the billion-fold working class is the material basis for freedom and progress. The great crime of  imperialism is that the grueling and often nonstop work performed in the underdeveloped world produces so little in relation to the labor performed in the relatively modern industries of Europe and America. But even labor under the most advanced conditions sees its productivity turned against us, used to enrich billionaires, impoverish us, and wage gigantically destructive wars. Socialist humanism is the only variety of humanism that confidently predicts a great expansion of freedom, worldwide, a revolutionary remaking of humanity, following the rise to power of the hitherto exploited working class.	2004-09-23

French workers were entering a period of militant combativeness, but the French Section of the Fourth International was in crisis as a result of its inability to respond to its expulsion from the rightward moving socialist party of France. Trotsky pointed to the problem for revolutionaries of unity with reformists. He called for working class unity in action against the attacks of the bosses and their fascist thugs (remember-fascism had conquered power in neighboring Germany)--but the time was already overripe for creating a party as part of a new international, untainted by the bankrupt policies of social democracy and Stalinism. Consciously or unconsciously, the reformists were preparing to drag the working class into the slaughter of World War II. The vital question of our epoch was, and still is-with imperialism or against it? The hesitancy of the members of the French Section, Trotsky pointed out, stemmed from their inability to decisively cast their lot with the working class policies of a new communist international, the Fourth International. Such a bold step would require them to break with their middle class backgrounds and with their friends in the reformist parties.	2004-08-19

A call to workers and farmers to organize, to study politics, to defend ourselves against imperialist oppression, and to take power in our own name-that is the call that rings out from the speeches and manifestos gathered in these volumes. The delegates are ordinary men and women discussing issues of total relevance for today: The importance of women's right to all workers and farmers, the struggle of the Muslim people against foreign domination, the need to support the Irish, mid-Eastern, African, Latin-Amrican and Indian workers against the colonial powers, the need to participate and lead wherever workers are in struggle, joining hands with any party of workers that attempts to seize power and take  control of society out of the hands of the tiny class of greedy capitalists that currently rule most of the globe. This edition puts you at ringside for all the discussions with wonderful photo signatures, chronology, appendix, notes, and introduction.

Trotsky's speech on Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht is a magnificent oration delivered to Russian workers just three days after these two were slain by a German death squad. It is a call to the workers to redouble their revolutionary work as the only  proper way to honor these great martyrs. It reminds me of another great oration-Fidel Castro's powerful tribute to Che Guevara, who had been hunted down and executed  at the behest of the CIA. The portrait of Nicholas and Alexandra Romanov totally exposes these incompetent but murderous rulers. It is a wonderful antidote to the tendency of capitalist propagandists to glamorize royalty. (Princess Di, the Dalai Lama-give me a break!) There are more than twenty portraits in this volume-all powerful and instructive. But to me the most moving is Trotsky's obituary to his son, Leon Sedov, a young man murdered under Stalin's orders. In describing his son, Trotsky outlines the best qualities that young revolutionaries should strive for and makes a presentation of his memory \\"to all those who work, suffer, and struggle for a better world.\\"	2004-03-25

He shows that history (pre-human as well as human) is marked by revolutionary advances. Cynics and reactionaries argue that progress is an illusion and revolution is beyond the scope of humanity today. Novack destroys these positions by pointing to a number of examples from history and science. Novack's range of knowledge makes for great reading. But it isn't idle entertainment. He ties human survival to the working class fight for solidarity, leading to socialism or communism, a society where class distinctions are abolished. This is a fight we can all participate in.

We suspect that this reasoning is bogus, but how can we describe it from a scientific point of view?

Why does the boss come out the winner when workers have to work overtime or when so-called labor saving devices are introduced into the workplace? This is another question that Mandel analyzes simply and accurately. In fact, Mandel provides an authoritative outline of Marxist economic theory, from the labor theory of value to what causes worldwide unemployment, depression, and war.

In these discussions with communists active in the labor movement, Trotsky defended the ideas of Black nationalism long before they were understood by American political activists. Trotsky emphasized that for good reason many Black workers saw white workers as part of the system of oppression.  Communists-white and Black-must be in the front ranks of the fight for Black rights, up to and including support for a Black party that fights for an independent Black nation. He pointed out that an independent Black nation is not a threat to workers who are white-- it is a threat to the common enemy, imperialism. His language is quite strong on this point. He said that no worker who fears or shrinks from the Black fight for self-determination can rightly call him or herself a communist. In the late 1930s, Trotsky predicted the vanguard role of Black workers and the emergence of leaders of the caliber of Malcolm X. If not available from Amazon, booksfrompathfinder will have it.

So what is the difference between Allende's Chile and Fidel's Cuba? In this little book on \\"Fidel Castro's Political Strategy,\\" Chilean writer Marta Harnecker takes up exactly this point, how Fidel always sought to mobilize Cuba's revolutionary people. Castro and the July 26 movement always avoided either sterile electoral reform or a simple coup that focuses on the hated ruler-in this case Batista, the U.S. supported dictator of Cuba in the  1950s. Fidel's strategy was always based on progressively mobilizing and inspiring the Cuban people to take the stage of history, and he and the Cuban people have succeeded in defending Cuba's revolution pretty well also. If the Cuban people were not ready at a moment's notice to defend the revolution, do you think it could have lasted a day-and almost forty-five years later, it's still strong. Also of great value in this book is the magnificent speech, \\"From Moncado to Victory,\\" which Castro gave as his defense before being hauled off to Batista's prison in 1953.

Stalin and the bureaucratic layer he represented were strangling the voices of authentic Marxism, advancing the narrow-minded idea of socialism in one country, and stifling all criticism. The bureaucratic gang was putting its needs ahead of the needs of workers around the world in the same way that, years later, the heirs of Stalin cut off all aid to Cuba (after doing nothing for Algeria and the Congo and almost nothing for Vietnam).

In the Soviet Union the human continuity of real Marxism was broken by Stalin, but the political program remains today.

Trotsky brilliantly analyzes the first fruits of Stalin's narrow world outlook in the years following the defeat of the German Revolution of 1923. On the domestic front, he points to the need to build an alliance of the working class and peasantry. Within the party, he calls for democratic discussion to replace lies and slander.

Their words, recorded in this well-annotated book, are totally relevant to today's young antiwar fighters.	2003-04-09

Read this little book on Walter Reuther, the longtime head of the UAW and spiritual father of today's labor misleaders. Bea Hansen tells the story of how Reuther, who once described himself as a socialist, traded his principles to mount the ladder of the bureaucracy to its top rung.<br />Hansen contrasts Reuther with another kind of labor leader, Eugene V. Debs, who fought for his socialist principles, tried to build a movement against the U.S. war machine, and supported the rank-and-file struggles of labor. Hansen is an authoritative voice on these issues. Members of her family led the Flint Sit-Down strike when she was a girl and she was a respected socialist fighter in the auto workers union for most of her life. This remarkable pamphlet ends with Hansen's confident prediction-in 1955 at the height of the witch hunt--that young people will pick up the struggle for socialism that Reuther abandoned.	2003-03-16

What this book clearly shows is how interconnected U.S. workers were-how mutually affected by economic disaster-and how willing to embark on massive and militant resistance. Are workers that different today? Are today's bosses-as they push for wage concessions and bailouts--that much different from the rail bosses of 1877? This book makes you think more seriously about the great events that could quickly develop out of today's economic downturn.

Two of these articles analyze this social layer (which exists in every imperialist nation) and how it is used to transmit patriotic, pro-war sentiment within the working class. The lead article outlines how the working class can be led to fight as part of an international class against imperialism and its drive toward war and depression. The articles are clear, well-written, and absolutely relevant.	2002-08-15

It has become enshrined as a results-oriented, experimental philosophy. Novack points out that although the starting point may be sound, empiricism is no longer adequate to understand the world, human society,  and how to join with others to change history. None of these last points are recognized as possibilities by the self-indulgent and indecisive empiricism promoted by capitalist institutions today. Dialectical materialism, on the other hand, looks at the root causes of events and takes a moral and political stand with a confidence based on scientific knowledge. Academic philosophers will not read this book and probably couldn't understand it.. It's written for you, the working class activist who wants to become more effective by understanding where you fit into the history of ideas.	2002-08-12

This book is the place to start. It gives the best explanation anywhere of the dynamics of the Chicano movement of the 1960s and 1970s,  focusing on issues that were important than and have become even more important today, such as: the movement to halt the deportation of and brutality toward Mexican workers; the need for bi-lingual, bi-cultural education (in recent years, groupings of Chicano youth have shown their fighting spirit on this issue, effectively answering Patrick Buchanan's \\"culture war\\"); police brutality; and Chicana feminism. There is a very valuable discussion of the accomplishments and limitations of Chicano nationalism in the electoral arena and an account of the Chicano Moratorium Against the War in Vietnam, which helps us understand the potential for a working class fight against war today.	2002-07-21

Cannon writings & speeches)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Fight Against Stalinism in the U.S.	Cannon was a central founder and leader of the working class wing of the Communist Party. He was expelled for organizing opposition to the Stalinization of this party. In these writings Cannon explains the dangers of Stalinism and contrasts it with the revolutionary Marxist alternative that he and a number of other workers were in the process of founding. These writings also touch on little known but important working class struggles before the thirties, like the textile battles of the south and the mineworkers &quot;save the union&quot; movement. Cannon's insights on politics as well as his fine writing ability make this a good read, and an important one for those wanting to discover their roots in the fight for a revolutionary party.	2002-07-19

The government put Cannon on trial. This book is the transcript of his courtroom testimony. He answers questions about the fundamentals of socialism-many of them posed by a very hostile government prosecutor. Despite the tense environment, Cannon speaks as though he were addressing interested co-workers during lunch-break in a factory. Down-to-earth, logical, witty, and with a deep and passionate grounding in Marxism. Cannon's assumption is that socialism, clearly explained, will make sense to workers. This approach--rather than talking-down or sugar-coating a la the Greens and other reformists-is the correct approach. As workers see their hopes of health, security, dignity and justice going down the tubes with the unfolding capitalist crisis, they want to hear the unvarnished truth about capitalism and socialism. This book gives it.	2002-07-17

These articles point to the danger of Hitler, the threat of war emerging from the weakness of capitalism, and the counter-revolutionary character of Stalinism. His article on Proletarian literature refutes the idea that workers could create our own culture without reshaping society.  Trotsky underscores the revolutionary potential of  U.S. workers and Black workers in particular. You will recognize, under the surface of todays events, the same great challenges that Trotsky described in 1932.	2002-05-10

After reading Cannon's tribute, Little became one of my heroes. He is a good hero, too--especially today when racist thugs (often with a badge) are targeting Blacks, immigrants and others. These brief journalistic glimpses show that Cannon knew how to write as well as he knew how to fight. Sacco and Vanzetti, Charlie Chaplin, Hiroshima and Jim Crow are among the many topics.

Trotsky points out that the military practice that defended the Russian Revolution against imperialist invasion was based on a political orientation-one that we can understand and fight for today, the workers and farmers alliance. He brilliantly defends this alliance against the ultralefts who unknowingly threatened it with their foolishness. He also debunks the so-called science of the reactionary stuffed shirts-like those military figures we see briefing the press today with their talk about smart bombs and surgically precise warfare.

When she wrote these articles twenty-five years ago, Reed warned that this trend in anthropology would be used to blunt the lessons of the women's liberation movement and submerge our thinking about the future of humanity in a morass of pessimism and liberal guilt. \\"Animal Rights\\" is the perfect example of what Reed was warning about. If you look at the way humanity created itself out of the primates, you get a liberating respect for what we can accomplish. If you look at the tremendous accomplishments of the long period of female dominance (without romanticizing it) you are in a position to refute the idea that women will always suffer domination. If humanity is to avoid capitalism's descent into barbarism (and we will), women will once again play the leading role.	2002-04-05

Debs Speaks	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Debs, Like Malcolm, Shows Working Class Potential	Eugene Victor Debs was sentenced to ten years in prison for the anti-imperialist speech he gave in Canton, Ohio in 1918. It is a fire-breathing speech full of love for the oppressed and hatred of the imperialist oppressor. After you buy this book, read this speech first. It tells you about the U.S. rulers today-and their wars. The  speeches in this well-rounded book (with a superb introduction by James P. Cannon), provide socialist answers to the big questions workers face today, as well as yesterday. His writings on the capitalist prison system are especially relevant. Debs, who spent four years behind bars himself, salutes the humanity of his fellow prisoners and points to the real criminal-\\"Capitalism is inherently a criminal system for it is based upon the robbery of the working class and cornerstoned in its slavery.\\"  Not much question about what he would think about U.S. wars and the anti-working class measures involved in Homeland Security. Like Malcolm X, Debs shows that the U.S. working class can indeed produce great leaders.

These are good reasons to read this inspiring volume, which captures the historic voice of the coal miners-Mother Jones. A woman of the working class, she took part in almost every major battle by coal miners from the 1890s through the 1920s. She declared her solidarity with all victims of class rule from New England to Japan and left the world with many famous dictums of the struggle: \\"Don't mourn, organize!\\" or \\"I'm not here to beg ,  I want to fight and take what belongs to us!\\" She joined social struggles like the fight against child labor. When the newspapers refused to cover a strike involving child textile workers because the mill owners held stock in the newspapers, Mother Jones declared: \\"Well, I've got stock in these little children and I'll arrange a little publicity.\\" And she did. While the U.S. was waging war on Mexico, Mother Jones was meeting with Pancho Villa to promote working class solidarity. We are also reminded that the task she described is still our task today: \\"Never before in human history were men and women called upon to link hands in the mighty battle for the emancipation of the working class from the robbing class.\\" Mother Jones proves that you can't count yourself or any one else out-Mother Jones didn't  become an activist until she was in her fifties. This is the total book by and about Mother Jones, with valuable background material by Philip Foner, the noted historian.	2002-03-16

Abram Leon was a Jewish Marxist and working class leader in Nazi-occupied Belgium until being shipped to his death in Auschwitz. He points out that Jews are a social grouping that played a dynamic role during feudalism but have no role as a distinct class under capitalism. Because capitalist society will not assimilate them, they become ready scapegoats. The solution Leon proposes is to join with other workers in the fight for a socialist society in place of capitalism, which is the root of racist movements. Leon's richly detailed history of the Jewish people challenges the myths of the Zionists. The fact that the imperialist nation of Israel has become the most dangerous place for Jews to live underscores Leon's point about the danger of Zionism.

We don't hear much about this vote or the British reaction to it--overturning the election, bombing parliament, jailing the newly elected representatives as well as many others. McAliskey tells us about this as well as about the British policy of internment without trial (which reminds us of the current policy of jailing immigrants). After reading this pamphlet you will see why Jerry Adams and the current Sinn Fein play such an important role in the world, despite ceaseless slander against Irish republicanism.	2001-12-01

Barnes explains how after a visit to Cuba in 1960 he and other student activists defended Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion. They stood up to both campus administrators and right-wing thugs and won the the right not only to speak out but to become the makers of history, like the Cubans. Barnes explains how the Cubans as a people demonstrated remarkable courage and determination in standing up to an imperialist terror campaign, arms in hand, while continueing their revolutionary work, which included a literacy campaign the likes of which has not been seen before or since.
