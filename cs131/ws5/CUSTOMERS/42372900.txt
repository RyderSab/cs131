As I was reading this book I felt it would make a GREAT movie! I hope someone does it because the characters on the big screen would be great to see. Not all novels work well for movies but this one sure does!<br /><br />MAN CAMP is created when 2 friends ponder over why the men available are in need of manners, ability to change a flat tire...you can the idea. Lucy has an old friend, Connor, a virile farm lad in West Virginia who lends his dairy farm as the area for this 'camp' to take place. Martha runs a FirstDate service (dating clients to aid them in their dating issues) and enlists some of her recent clients in this camp while Lucy has her boyfriend, Adam, join in as well without telling him exactly what it is! Martha's brother, in need of help too, goes unknowingly as well.<br /><br />There is a scene before Man Camp activities begin when Lucy and Adam go away for a weekend and it looks like Lucy is more adapted at survival than Adam - this makes Lucy question their relationship if he can't function in the woods. It's a VERY funny part of the book. The introduction of the clients on FirstDate are hilarious; the reader knows there are guys out there like this and it makes it funnier.<br /><br />The story is light and fun and not man-bashing. It's a quick read as the summer winds down. Try it!	2005-09-02
US	42372900	R2UUW6L03P2Q9P	0066213355	62247710	Sweetwater Creek	Books	3	13	16	N	N	Ms. Siddons ~ what were you thinking?	This is more of a 2 star read for me but the description was good overall so I give it 3 stars. It is a coming of age story of a preteen girl, Emily, whose mother left when she was three years old. Emily lives in a Lowcountry plantation with her father and brothers. A cook and Aunt give some motherly attention to Emily in this testosterone-driven house.<br /><br />Oh MY where do I start? Well, the story begins very well and is quite a pageturner until Lulu, an older girl arrives and stays on the property for a summer but stays a few months more. Lulu is a troubled girl but you have no idea what trouble until she explains everything to the young Emily. The reader is appalled by it all and basically when Lulu's secrets are revealed, I think the novel goes downhill and loses worth.<br /><br />This is not a typical Siddons' novel and I don't know what it is really. There is a jumbled mess of goings on ~ Lulu's high society family is too much to take and her grandmother, Grand, is crazy as a loon. There's alot of poetry flowing here and there that doesn't seem to relate to much. Emily's best, and only, friend is a dog; she talks with her dead brother and somehow is the most leveled headed character in the book.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book at all. I love Siddons books but this one is a doozy I'd rather forget.	2005-08-31

Another relaxing read about Mma Ramotswe and the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. I enjoy this series but this installment lacks abit and I hope the next one in the series has more umph to it! There wasn't as much humor as in past books ~ there is a funny scene when Mma Ramotswe comes home to find her kettle misplaced and a man flee from under her bed and while doing so, loses his trousers!<br /><br />These books are made up of little stories, really, and each take the reader abroad for a different pace story than the norm which is a welcome change in today's books.	2005-08-09

This story, more of a 4.5 star book, takes off from page one and gets the reader laughing throughout the book. The writing is fast paced and very good.<br /><br />Gracie is married, almost 10 years, to Kenny, a Hollywood studio big shot, when he decides he doesn't want to be married to her anymore and tells her over the cell phone on a bad connection. Gracie goes into a whirl of a time, trying to figure out who she will be since she has been the Wife Of... for so long. The couple have a young daughter, Jaden, who adds bubbly dialouge to the story as well.<br /><br />The description of Hollywood wives and marriages is a hoot ~ when Gracie leaves for Malibu (8 miles away) to get her life back on track, she encounters a new set of wealthy there too. Her close friends, Will and Cricket, keep her sane while their lives are also colorful.<br /><br />Kenny begins to date a younger celeb (no surprise there) and remains self-centered throughout the book. It's a wonder he and Gracie had such a romantic early time of it.<br /><br />While in \\"bu\\", Gracie is attracted to a strange man on the beach who turns out to be HOMELESS! This was a stretch for me and the only thing holding back from a 5 star read for me. Sam Knight is more than you think and the ending is a surprise.<br /><br />This is a GREAT book for summer reading; I will surely check out her other books.	2005-07-27

Samantha Sweeting is a workaholic and that's an understatement! She is on the verge of going partner but a debacle occurs and things swift for her career. She finds herself in the countryside working as a housekeeper and she can only make toast and coffee! The characters are well defined and there are several funny passages but overall, it's a cookie-cutter story of a career girl turned domestic. I liked it but was a wee disappointed it wasn't as good as her last two books. Pick it up for a fun beach read though.	2005-07-26

This sends him to bed for recovery and meanwhile the house gets another visitor, Julie's daughter, Nora, who is pregnant with triplets and also on bedrest. Julie's daughter, Sandy, who is married to Romeo's son, Tony, and their children live in the house as well. It makes for a busy place and there's always something on TV....WILLY WONKY AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY which is Sarah's favorite movie.<br /><br />Sarah, 8, believes in the film and wishes for winning her own golden ticket.

I adore Ms. Frank's storytelling and how she can lure the reader, from the first page, to the coastal beauty and charm of South Carolina.

A newcomer arrives named Rebecca and a whirlwind ensues. Turns out Nat, her husband, a loser of ALL losers!, has turned their kids against her and done some pretty kinky, weird stuff. Huey's dear friend, Abigail, enters the picture and is led to practice law once again - seeing that Rebecca's divorce settlement goes as it should.<br /><br />The writing flows and as always, I love the little southern bits of the story here and there.

I have just spent all evening reading this book; I couldn't put it down! How wonderful for an author to bring such a story of 'what ifs' to life.<br /><br />The plot enticed you from the title as it captivates the reader with Anne Frank's Peter living in America; detailing his married life with children and how the past comes to his present as much as he doesn't want it to. He finds he wants to defend it and goes on a journey, with the reader, to do so.<br /><br />Feldman does a fantastic job at bringing this fictional idea to the page and as the book ends, you wish, oh you wish, it were true. Everyone should read this book. Even after all these years, Anne Frank is still in the hearts and minds of people and for that I am thankful.	2005-05-06

While the union is iffy in the beginning, you will learn their rhythm as the story goes on.<br /><br />Mattie keeps a journal which her dear friend back home, Carrie, gave to her.

US	42372900	R1OM0IGFLMGPEW	0312326742	363967805	The Garden Angel: A Novel	Books	4	0	1	N	N	book is so much more than the title implies...	The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was that it was wordy in too many parts. It was as if it needed some further editing of the story but overall it was a very good first novel.<br /><br />Cutter, a 25yr old single woman, lives in her family's house and is trying to hold on to it but her siblings want her to sell it. She makes the home look unappealing so buyers won't line up outside. Her sister, Ginnie, is dating a married Professor and ends up pregnant. Elizabeth, 'the wife', becomes good friends with Cutter and this tangled connection seems to work.<br /><br />The story moves fast but when the long stretches come, it lags abit. Cutter works at a pancake diner as well as writes obits for the newspaper. She was very close to her Gran who died in recent months. The reader feels that Cutter is very much like her grandmother and thus should be in the house for all time.<br /><br />There are no surprises in this story; it's a simple story but told in a well-written way. I look forward to another book by this author!	2005-02-10

They live in Western PA in a mining community. The father dies at 54 and the story weaves the lives of the children and Rose - how they coped with his death and what they did with their lives. The book spans several decades and brings you close into each character. It is true literature and while the ending isn't a cheerful pictorial, it is a solid testament to a strong family raised under harsh circumstances where family follows your heart no matter where you go.	2005-02-08

I don't know if a snowy weekend to read this book heightened my love of it but it was a very good story.<br /><br />Sophie and Paul leave the Washington, DC area for Maine because of Paul's job. Sophie does freelance artwork while Paul is the main breadwinner.<br /><br />Nathalie, Paul's coworker, develops a crush (as Sophie sees it) on Paul and their relationship threatens the marriage. Sophie joins a walking group to mingle with Mainers. There she meets Stephen and Ned who become constant friends.<br /><br />Just as snowflakes float slowly does this novel move through seasons of Sophie's year. She is faced with a horrible mother in law, Pepper, who comes for the holiday and treats Sophie in the ways only an insincere mother in law can behave.<br /><br />The reader roots for Sophie and witnesses her strength toward the end of the novel, as she needs to stand up for herself and lead the life she is meant to have.	2005-01-23

I laughed outloud silly during the first part of the book and then things got serious when Whitney's friend, Kim, is diagnosed with breast cancer. I do wish the summary on the back cover hinted to a serious plot twist but it was fine. The author wove it all in beautifully and there were laughs amid tears.<br /><br />Book is filled with prayer guidance as well as scripture references that I found inspiring and perfectly fit in the story. I would like to think we will see Whitney again in another journaling type book. hint hint!!!	2005-01-10

Her recipes seem abit far fetched in most cases and from the one, yes one recipe, that I tried it tasted like a diet recipe and it doesn't have to!<br /><br />There was alot in the book about health and nutrition that is helpful but as a cookbook, I felt it lacked in the practical.

THE WINDMILL is a novel about a couple whose marriage is filled with secrets and through revealing them and healing, do they get past the distance between them all these years.<br /><br />Olivia was a likeable character and certainly Noah, her first husband, was a favored one as well. Noah had lots of spunk and life to him but sadly his life is cut short. She grieves long, of course, and then marries Carl, who has secrets as well. The two drift through life and years later Carl just disappears one day.<br /><br />The novel is fast moving and well written but I guess I was wanting more. When the story ended, I felt satisfied but just not enough to give it 5 stars. I'll read more of this author's books but this isn't one of my favorites. Some of the plot seemed too forced and familiar with other novels. The connection of the windmill was alittle corny and I normally don't mind corny!	2004-12-30

However, it was a tender story of a father and his twelve year old daughter finding a newborn abandoned in the snow. The reasons behind the baby being left in the woods is unearthed slowly.<br /><br />Plot shifts from past to present and it weaves the story of Nicky and her father and their grief.

She grew up with her father, Jack.<br />A father and his blind daughter, Kayla, arrive at the Inn and there begins the well crafted story. It was quite rivetting in parts and I found it really hard to put down! There are really two stories going on at once and the title means so much.

I had heard about it from the Today show and honestly didn't know it was that long until I saw it in the bookstore. It is long and in some places, could have been edited here and there.<br />Henry has a VERY rare genetic disorder where he disappears and travels back and forth in time. He is married to Clare and at times you wonder if they aren't married just because he told her they were in the past so therefore she knows that's the future and just does it. Make sense? Ok - I told you this is a bizarre tale.<br />I think the ending was the best part of the book for me as it wrapped up things very nicely.

Well, this read is good but not as developed as the first and the story is more intense.<br />Charlotte's mother, Corinne, dies and in the will, Charlotte is to live with her biological father, William, for a year in her mother's apartment. Charlotte and William had never met before this so it is a bit of a challenge at first. Charlotte dips into acting and the basis of the story revolves around the acting class and her flirt with another actor in the class, Irish Colin.<br />I thought there was more focus on this fling rather than the premise of Charlotte and her father getting to know each other. While it did reveal their new relationship, it didn't develop it as much as I think it should have.<br />Overall an ok read but not what I thought it would be.	2003-08-12

This book was a wonderful insight into America's &quot;first&quot; First Lady. Not only did the book delve into Martha's life, it painted a picture of the times in which she lived. I learned more about the period and slavery than I thought I would ~ very well written. My favorite part was learning more about her first marriage to Daniel Parke Custis.

I fell in love with Moyer's first book, THE SECOND COMING OF LUCY HATCH, and of course had to read this one and get my fill of Ash Farrell again.<br />The story starts with Lucy and Ash living together and let me tell you - the first chapter is the best in the book as far as I'm concerned. Beautiful imagery; Moyer brings words to life with their love for each other. We meet Denise, Ash's 15yr old daughter, who is dropped off by her mother who is on her way to another adventure in Chicago. Denny doesn't want to interupt the love-fest going on but soon settles in and becomes part of the \\"family\\".<br />Story weaves a race issue as Denise (Denny) makes friends with Erasmus and the town troublemakers do their damage. This is just a small part of the story and I felt that it was boring; I wanted a story more about Ash and Lucy but it was still worth reading.<br />I see another Ash/Lucy book in Moyer's future and I plan on reading it too.	2003-06-11

I was so looking forward to this book. ...and thought this looked like an American version on a theme. Don't be fooled!<br />This story is about Amanda Bright who has 2 children, Ben and Sophie, and married to Bob, who the story really is about. I found Amanda's friends to be fakes and curious why she kept in the same circles with them.<br />If you think this book, as marketed in my opinion, is about a stay at home mom, then think again. It's about Bob, Amanda's husband and his job. The children are thrown in here and there and one is portrayed as violent and never fully explained why so. Amanda yells at her kids and acts like they are always in the way; she wonders constantly if she should go back to work.<br />The cover is attractive and so is the summary on the back - but pass this one up!	2003-05-19

It was boring, disjointed and read more like a fine essay than a novella/novel. I truly don't understand what all the hype is about this little book.<br />The writing, while eloquent, is lacking and I just don't have much to say about it other than it is boring.

In THE SUNDAY WIFE, the reader is refreshened to a new story and a cast of characters very familiar but not.<br />Pastor Ben and his wife, Dean, move to a larger church and you are behind the scenes in this book rather than in the congregation! It shows an insight on what goes on with this Pastor and his wife - their seperate life together and their life in the church.<br />Ben's vision is a selfish one and his attitude towards his wife is appalling throughout the book. Dean becomes friends with Augusta who brings, IMHO, makes Dean stronger than she ever was before.<br />An amazing read - a powerful one and one that should be read and savored.	2002-10-13

I love southern fiction and I was so excited about this one BUT while funny in the first few pages, don't be fooled. This story is lacking in PLOT and it never really grabbed me. I had to force myself to finish it!<br />The main character, Lin, is not very likeable and is bitter towards all men because her husband left her. She gets in a weird relationship with her boss, Grant, and things just never pan out for her but it does take a postitive turn towards the end of the book.<br />Overall, a boring story but I finished it ~ yeah!

I read THE WORLD BELOW and had to read another Sue Miller book because it was so good! I picked up this one, WHILE I WAS GONE, and while I did enjoy it, it didn't move me as the other did. I find it always very interesting how authors can write such a wonderful novel and then a so~so one also.<br />The story is woven well but there are parts which I feel lacked information and when I ended the book, I didn't feel I really did know Jo Becker at all. I enjoyed the writing style but the plot around the 60's and the group house was not something I could relate to. I felt Jo was evasive to her family and friends when she didn't have to be. I don't think Jo really knew herself.<br />I'd say it is worth reading but not one of Miller's best. I give it a weak 4.	2002-09-28

Chris's husband is abusive in character and the writing is so real and disturbing at times. Her network of buddies appear to be friends for life, but I think their friendship wasn't as thick as it was made out to be.

The author is a master at storytelling and the book is broken up into Parts, rather than chapters and this worked so well. Within each part there were short passages which made it a good read to pick up and set down.<br />The captivating and descriptive life of the immigrant family represented in this story was so real. I felt like I had actually met Chenia (the main character) and felt her disgust for her husband, Ruben. The story also spans many years which is fun in a book - to see where everyone is years from the beginning of the book. The title was perfect and the cover of the book plays in your mind as you read this book. It was as if the book was a work of art, IMHO.	2002-08-22
