It really explains many concepts of modern physics in layman's terms. Often we hear scientific words bantered about on various educational television programming without really understanding the concepts and theories behind them. This book goes into concise detail on quite a few topics and does a rather good job explaining them. I thought the explanation of Einstein's general theory of relativity was well done. The explanation of time differential when matter nears the speed of light was explained quite clearly. It truly is relative from your vantage point. Also the concept of space being curved was well presented. This is really a very interesting book. I truly couldn't put it down when I found it in the library. It really stimulates your thought processes and gives you new perspectives on the world we live in. I really like this book.	2005-10-12

The first title that I can fondly remember was \\"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\\" that my parents bought me. What I remember most and what really interested me were the illustrations. I had seen the film in the theatre and I was really interested in having this book to go along with the movie. I spent many hours over the coarse of my childhood looking at those pictures and savoring all the enjoyment they gave me helping me relive my experience of seeing that film. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" was the first new Disney film that my daughter had ever seen in the theatre. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" was also the first Little Golden Book I purchased for her. I hadn't really looked at any of these books in years but it was almost by instinct when I picked up \\"The Little Mermaid\\" in the bookstore and brought it home for her. How knew the style of the illustrations looked, not quite the same as \\"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\\" as I remember. However, life does comes full-circle I suppose. This was always my daughter's favorite Little Golden Book. I used to read the book to her as she looked at the pictures at bedtime. None of the subsequent Little Golden Books seemed to hold the same magic that \\"The Little Mermaid\\" did for her. I just found her copy of this book in the cellar the other day. I picked it up and looked through it. I suppose this was the first time that I really looked at the illustrations, I mean really looked at them. They didn't look quite that new any more. They were beginning to show their age. I just didn't realize how many years had passed since I had purchased it. Life continues on with another circle. I am so glad that I still have this book and am able to clutch it in my hands and just remember.	2005-09-25

Data collection is very important for analysis. Thus, data collection systems designs are important to this end. The statistical representation of Six Sigma is really the best benchmark to quantify and evaluate process performance. This book ultimately must rely on that fact. I found this book's reasoning similar to that of trying to define Standard Deviation in words. Standard Deviation is a formula. I did find this book thought provoking and I liked the fact that such concepts as Six Sigma are still alive. Most companies fail because they bring Six Sigma in but then give up on it. In my area of the country I have spoken to so many people who no longer use it even though their companies say otherwise. If you want to learn more about Six Sigma this really is not a bad book.	2005-09-12

I found the first two thirds of the novel very well written. The final third of the novel seems to lose all its steam and sinks into literary mediocrity and that's what really interests me. The first third of this novel contains some of the best prose that Fleming ever put on paper. It is rich in detail and thoroughly engrossing. It is a true delight to read and savor. As the novel enters the second the third it still remains engrossing but seems to lack some of Fleming's usual drive and coherency. The final third falls below what could even be considered commonplaceness for Fleming. Fleming seems to have just given up on this project at some point and just finished it out to get it into publication. Yet THUNDERBALL remains one of my favorite Fleming novels. The first third truly is brilliant and I enjoy reading it and examining at what point Fleming became disinterested.	2003-10-24

US	49837360	RPN08DDPREEH5	0684838281	76252703	Experience And Education	Books	5	13	27	N	Y	Education in a Democracy	John Dewey's thesis regarding experience and learning in a democracy can be stated with some measure of accuracy with a few simple statements. However, these statements based upon layers of theoretical and philosophical writings by Dewey are a surreptitious higher exercise that tests the reader's aptitude to discern seemingly indistinguishable yet distinct concepts into a cohesive statement on the complementary nature of experience and education.<br />John Dewey's thesis primarily comes out of his experience with progressive schools. Progressive education is based on the idea of freedom whereas traditional education is autocratic in nature. Having analyzed both traditional and progressive education Dewey found that neither was satisfactory and thus both were inadequate in this endeavor. Dewey's main contention and cornerstone of belief is that without experience infused into education there can be no education. America is a nation based upon democracy where supreme power is vested in the people collectively and administered by them. There is no autocracy in America or room for it. America is a land of freedom and free thought. Dewey foresaw an America that will bring in all sources of experience that will offer a true learning situation both historically and socially and that will be both ordered or structured and yet be dynamic. The democracy of America provides all the elements for John Dewey's thesis to come to fruition.<br />Dewey saw a necessity of introducing an order of new concepts (progressivism) leading to new practices. However Dewey observed it difficult to develop a new philosophy of education because the moment traditions are departed from it makes the management of education all the more difficult and challenging. Dewey observed that because of this there would be a return to the old ways, the simpler ways - the fundamental or traditional ways. Dewey observed that mankind's thinking is traditionally set in terms of extreme opposites. Dewey found that this same thinking applied to educational philosophies as well. In theory educational systems are steadfast in their thinking and deployment but in reality their practices are compelled to compromise. Education is formulated from outside forces but undergoes development from internal forces.  However, these internal forces work within the framework of standards and traditional rules that initially instituted the educational system, thus all following actions aimed to an educational end are held to a moral benchmark.<br />Educational philosophy, which professes to be based on the idea of freedom (progressivism), may become dogmatic as the traditional education it reacted against. Alone a progressive educational theory may become rigid, unmoving and dictatorial as the traditional theory and practice is perceived. Dewey found that tradition does not permit freedom. Tradition limited freedom and did not promote intellectual and moral development of the student. From a sociological point of view we prefer democratic and humane arrangements to those that are autocratic and harsh. Thus tradition can further be characterized by harshness, harshness imposed upon the learner. Dewey found that progressivism permits freedom, the freedom of the learner yet, freedom has a purpose and a moral structure characterized by self-control. Freedom gives the ability to control personal impulse and thus provides an environment for the educational process.<br />Pertaining to subject matter of facts and ideas Dewey found that these are bound up in the past. Variably Dewey found that issues of the present and future are thus not easily dealt with. Dewey's dilemma or philosophical challenge was how to connect achievements of the past with issues of the present and future. In a broad educational sense one must know where one came from in order to tell where one is and where one has the direction to go. Dewey found that progressivism rejects the past as a means to the future. However, traditionis still needed to tackle the needs of progressivism. If the one gives up the ways of the past the same problems stills confronts one in the present and future. Thus tradition can not be ignored. As Alfred Whitehead saw it the only use of knowledge of the past is to equip us for the present. The present contains all that there is. Tradition is a form of experience and can not be ignored.<br />Experience and education are not synonymous terms. It is very possible for experience to promote erroneous or defective education. Experience must be evaluated for its ability to enhance education. Dewey states that America needs a theory of experience that works and directs the selection and organization of approved educational methods. This theory must ultimately discriminate between experiences that are worthwhile and those that are not. There must be discrimination between education and miseducation. You can get experience in one direction and equally important open up peripheral experiences. Education as growth and maturity should be an ever-present process. Education is the business of continuous improvement. There is growth and satisfaction.<br />All subject matter is drawn from life's experiences. Take experience, in order to be educative it must lead out into expanding world of subject matter, subject matter of facts of information of ideas. It must be viewed as a continuous process to be successful. Experience is the means and goal of education. Given an idea you then prove it, but that means proving its worth. You prove its worth through experience. This is good for society and beneficial because of the peripheral benefits of experience. The experience is the actual life experience of the learner. There is only one subject matter for education: life. Bring these experiences freely into the classroom to promote education.ill needed to tackle the needs of progressivism.

It really captures the enigmatic quality this particular James Bond novel by Ian Fleming exudes. In one sense this is Ian Fleming's homage to the mystique of the American gangster. Fleming's vision of the American gangster is one of a twisted, often emotionally and physically, violent character teeming with idiosyncrasies. They are a peculiar bunch to say the least. James Bond appears to be more the knight in shining armor in this novel than in most written by Fleming. Much of this can be attributed to the tough but sympathetic character of Tiffany Case whom Bond becomes emotionally attached and must rescue. It is interesting how in the film series the two primary directors, Terrence Young and Guy Hamilton, were influenced by the literary Bond created by Fleming. Hamilton seems to have been greatly influenced by this novel more than any of Fleming's others. We see Fleming's 1950's version of American hoodlums show up in Hamilton's &quot;Goldfinger,&quot; &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; and even at the beginning of &quot;The Man With The Golden Gun.&quot; More importantly this novel demonstrates Bond's affinity for the ever-fleeting notion of true love. Tiffany Case is the diamond in the rough that touches Bond's heart. This novel equally contains engaging scenes between James Bond and &quot;M&quot; and the overall description of the diamond smuggling pipeline is pure Fleming. This novel is highly recommended reading giving more insight into the psyche of James Bond.	2003-05-18

The problem is there are too many fingers in the pie. I would have liked to read about one historian's perspective on all the films reviewed. Instead, each film was addressed and compared to historical recollections by a different author. There is no uniformity of thought or perspective. For instance, I am sure that if Stephen Ambrose had reviewed TORA! TORA! TORA! he may have seen that film in a much more favorable light than did Akira Iriye. One can speculate to infinitum. It is possible to find and read countless books on a given historical topic. The point I am making is that each author has the ability to bring different perspectives or interpretations of historical record that may result in different conclusions of events or more importantly ideas.  If you were to ask an auditorium full of historians what was the most important factor contributing to the start of the Civil War I am sure you may get at least five good answers. Perhaps the idea that a film conveys is more important than the accuracy of each step that led to that idea. I think that SPARTACUS is an important film not as a representation of a historical record but for the idea that the inherent rights of human beings to live free is a notion worth dying for. Kirk Douglas as SPARTACUS stated something to the effect that he would never stand by and see two men battle and die just for the amusement of other men. There is something very noble about that statement and to the visuals on the screen that precipitated that assertion. To touch a chord of emotion from the audience is really the magic of the cinema. I never once ever thought that the purpose of the cinema was to teach history. For the audience the main purpose of the cinema is to be entertained and if you take it a few more steps perhaps come away with an idea or spark of imagination. That's the beauty of the cinema.	2002-10-03

This book precedes \\"You Only Live Twice\\" as it sends James Bond on a mission to track down the head of SPECTRE. This is a very well written novel and is very interesting trying to fathom what Fleming had been contemplating for his hero at that time in his life. I found this absorbing novel very difficult to put down once I started reading it as I did with its follow-up. If you do decide to read it I recommend that you read it before \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" I will go one step further, if you read both of these novels then read \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" after you finish \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" These three novels make up a sort of trilogy. One hint: \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" is very close to the movie version. \\"You Only Live Twice\\" and \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" movies have very little at all to do with the Fleming novels in any direct sense of plot and conflict. So don't be discouraged. I have read these three novels several times over. In this novel the relationship between Bond and M becomes clearer while Bond's own convictions come under self-scrutiny.

This is a great book and tries to define the spirit, will and actions of what the American psyche was and to what lengths Americans rise to the occasion. Modern America was never tested.

Dorling Kindersley is starting to corner the market on good looking and attractive books. This book is very visually conceived, designed and presented so this book is right up Dorling Kindersley's alley. They know how to do it right. Each James Bond film is addressed with an emphasis on its production design (gadgets, sets, etc.).  We are given 3 dimensional views of key sets from each film. This is what I really liked about it. This is a great companion book to Sally Hibbons' The Official James Bond Movie Book that was also very beautifully presented.

The first title that I can fondly remember was \\"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\\" that my parents bought me. What I remember most and what really interested me were the illustrations. I had seen the film in the theatre and I was really interested in having this book to go along with the movie. I spent many hours over the coarse of my childhood looking at those pictures and savoring all the enjoyment they gave me helping me relive my experience of seeing that film. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" was the first new Disney film that my daughter had ever seen in the theatre. \\"The Little Mermaid\\" was also the first Little Golden Book I purchased for her. I hadn't really looked at any of these books in years but it was almost by instinct when I picked up \\"The Little Mermaid\\" in the bookstore and brought it home for her. How knew the style of the illustrations looked, not quite the same as  \\"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\\" as I remember. However, life does comes full-circle I suppose. This was always my daughter's favorite Little Golden Book. I used to read the book to her as she looked at the pictures at bedtime. None of the subsequent Little Golden Books seemed to hold the same magic that \\"The Little Mermaid\\" did for her. I just found her copy of this book in the cellar the other day. I picked it up and looked through it. I suppose this was the first time that I really looked at the illustrations, I mean really looked at them. They didn't look quite that new any more. They were beginning to show their age. I just didn't realize how many years had passed since I had purchased it. Life continues on with another circle. I am so glad that I still have this book and am able to clutch it in my hands and just remember.	2001-06-13

I know that one was a surgeon and the other was in the infantry. In the 1920s my family moved to Texas a state colorful with history, legend and folklore. The Civil War has always been a topic of great interest to me. However, my dad relocated to the East (after marrying my mom) just before serving in the Korean War. Being born and raised in New England myself, I have always had mixed loyalties when it came to studying the Civil War. That in alone has always fueled my interest.  This book by Jay Winik is by far the most interesting book to come out in years. His analysis of information and facts is really innovative. I like movies, especially older ones. I keep telling my friends that to appreciate many older films you have to put yourself into the time and place of when the film was made to really understand the social, moral and ethical issues that were current to understand the level and importance of its impact. What was going on at the time? Not only does Jay Winik address this question but also he brilliantly and intuitively interprets logical scenarios that could have taken place. He profiles the psyches of Lee, Grant, Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Davis and others and examines the actions of these men in context to the exact time and place of many critical events occurring in that last month of the war. Winik is never judgmental but he makes brilliant observations on the way these historical figures changed their thinking from the beginning of the war to and during its last days. It seems evident that slavery was a non-issue to the Confederacy after four years. It seemed more a struggle for land and the right to sovereignty and honor of it. If General Lee had ever reorganized the struggle to guerrilla war tactics that raises many profound questions. Our ancestors had fought the British with these tactics on several confrontations so there was a historical precedent to do so. It seems that Lee made both a rational and moral choice in his decision to surrender not even knowing what the terms would be. He took a gamble but it also appears that Grant was a very practical individual and let Lee's men keep their side arms and horses against popular sentiment in the North to vanquish the South. People in the North would have seen Lee hanged buried and then salt the dirt he lay in. This is such a great book because it gets the reader's mental juices flowing. Winik gives the reader insight and understanding of just how frail our very existence as a nation is. History is like Physics where every action has a reaction. Jay Winik has raised the interpretation and analysis of historical records to the next level.

This book is brilliantly illustrated with photographs and drawings covering every aspect of the move. If you like films and filmmaking you should enjoy this book.	2001-05-31

Fleming's vision of the American gangster is one of a twisted, often emotionally and physically, violent character teeming with idiosyncrasies. They are a peculiar bunch to say the least. James Bond appears to be more the knight in shining armor in this novel than in most written by Fleming. Much of this can be attributed to the tough but sympathetic character of Tiffany Case whom Bond becomes emotionally attached and must rescue. It is interesting how in the film series the two primary directors, Terrence Young and Guy Hamilton, were influenced by the literary Bond created by Fleming. Hamilton seems to have been greatly influenced by this novel more than any of Fleming's others. We see Fleming's 1950's version of American hoodlums show up in Hamilton's \\"Goldfinger,\\" \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\" and even at the beginning of \\"The Man With The Golden Gun.\\" Terrence Young on the other hand seems to be more influenced by Ian Fleming's worldly hero on a more personal level and Fleming's picturesque travelogue pacing. This novel does not have the narrative flow of some of Fleming's best, but it does contain interesting scenes between James Bond and \\"M\\" and the overall description of the diamond smuggling pipeline is pure Fleming. Recommended reading.	2001-05-15

There seems a deliberate attempt to challenge the reader/viewer to discern the real life personality from the screen persona from the photographs chosen for this book. The result is a somewhat enigmatic experience leaving one with an euphoric feeling of melancholy.  I think this is an important book for anyone who loves films from that era. The meticulous quality of this book allows you to stare into the eyes of these people stimulating your own imagination into your soul.  It challenges you to find an answer to your own attraction to these immortal icons of a Hollywood long past and hopefully not forgotten.	2001-05-15

He is a man of extensive knowledge on the subject of James Bond and his ability to discuss this subject is boundless. This book covers each of the Broccoli / United Artists James Bond films. These are the official films. The book gives objective information on each title written with editorial doses of interest which maintains a consistency of perspective from cover to cover. There are no favorites in the traditional sense. The authors know very well that no filmmaker or group of filmmakers ever intentionally makes an inferior motion picture. It is all a matter of how well the filmmakers combine their efforts and produce a finished product. The focus of the book is the filmmaking, not hype or glamour. The Bond films have always maintained a high ideal of production standards and this book examines that process. Besides the filmmaking this book also examines the James Bond phenomena from product merchandising (including books, toys, music, videos, games, etc.) to the cultural impact of Ian Fleming's hero. It even covers such offshoots such as the animated TV series \\"James Bond Jr.\\" The book also contains key interviews with members of the acting and production crews. It is also profusely and beautifully illustrated with many colour photographs. I highly recommend this book. And take from me, Philip Lisa is more than just a contributor on this publication.	2001-03-17

This book stands as a compendium to works on his best known subject, New England. Samuel Chamberlain was one of America's preeminent photographers during the early and mid 20th Century. He is conspicuously and sadly forgotten today. I use the word conspicuously because if you every see his photographs as originally published he no doubt would have left you intrigued and impressed by the richness of the work. It is amazing how his black &amp; white photographs could actually capture the colors of the New England foliage. One can feel the sun shining through autumn colored leaves. I think his greatest passion and love was the rural New England setting. I was recently very pleased to see \\"The New England Image\\" back in print and on the bookshelves. The first printing, which was bound and printed by Conzett &amp; Huber, Zurich, Switzerland, 1962 is one of Samuel Chamberlain's best-known and most popular books.

This book precedes \\"You Only Live Twice\\" as it sends James Bond on a mission to track down the head of SPECTRE. This is a very well written novel and is very interesting trying to fathom what Fleming had been contemplating for his hero at that time in his life. I found this absorbing novel very difficult to put down once I started reading it as I did with its follow-up. If you do decide to read it I recommend that you read it before \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" I will go one step further, if you read both of these novels then read \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" after you finish \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" These three novels make up a sort of trilogy. One hint: \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" is very close to the movie version. \\"You Only Live Twice\\" and \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" movies have very little at all to do with the Fleming novels in any direct sense of plot and conflict.

What is significant about this book is the ingenuity and tactics employed by the prisoners in their numerous escape attempts. Most people are familiar with the film of the same name, but this book goes into much greater depth and detail. What I found most interesting about the book was how the Allies were able to bribe the German guards into obtaining essentials they needed for their escape and aftermath. The German guards' fear of retribution from their own superiors helped advance the Allies' efforts. This is a very good book and makes for good reading.

If you do become intrigued, you must locate copies circa the time of the original date of publication. I am not an expert on printing techniques and papers, but I do know that his original works were usually printed on a bright white matte finish paper, which reproduced the photographs as close to photograph paper as was possible. When you see photographs in a newspaper, they look as though they are made up from a series of dots, which they are. I believe what you are seeing is a sample of the dpi or dots per square inch.

His name is an American Icon. He is world renowned for the unforgettable images that he brought to the silver screen, which captured the imaginations of young and old alike. Those images and characters he created have transcended the movie houses they were originally shown in and have leaped into literature, art, toys and educational entertainment parks touching almost every part of the globe.<br />The creator of the iconic character, Mickey Mouse, both as an illustrator and supplier of Mickey's original voice, brought together a highly specialized yet diversely talented team of artists and craftsmen whose works will endure for all mankind.<br />There was something always very characteristic on whatever Walt Disney had a personal hand in. Even his live action films that he personally produced have that unique Walt Disney look and feel about them. Their sights and sounds have an enduring quality about them which remains with anyone that has viewed them.<br />Through the end of my adolescence there began a time when I began to feel that Walt's films were nothing more than some cornball kid's stuff and were nothing more than mildly entertaining fluff. However, in retrospect I now see the emotional charged craftsmanship that went into his films. They were always interesting, but more importantly they always sparked the imagination and some such as \\"Old Yeller\\" brutally challenged the younger viewer to prepare for the responsibilities of adulthood.<br />I think that while Walt was alive especially heading into the 1960s he was beginning to become taken for granted and his legacy was somewhat cynically scrutinized as something archaic and out of step with the \\"real world.\\" I think that today as members of the \\"real world\\" we have to take a look back and see the values that one man cherished and wanted to share with all the people on this planet. We are losing those values ever so quickly cloaked in a stealth-like path to ultimate despair. It is good to see that one man's vision and hope that the future generations of society would not abandon those values, but cling to them and nurture them. That vision is not dead.<br />Walt is remembered. This book was very inspiring and uplifting. It was good to read anecdotes from people who knew him and were touched by his devotion to his ideals through his approach to his many endeavors. Annette Funicello, Dean Jones, the Sherman brothers, Kurt Russell, Hayley Mills and many others were very kind to share their fond experiences with Walt. They remind us that he is indeed not forgotten and has left an indelible mark on all those that he touched as a man and through his works. I highly recommend this book.espair.

Pragmatic versatility is sort of an ergonomic approach for the mind and eye. I often find that once I have found a web site I must examine it carefully to attempt successful navigation and obtain the information that I seek. More than frequently this is accomplished via intuition. Many sites remind me of those puzzles you would find in the back of old comic books where you have to find the hidden picture within a picture. Someone told me that if I took my stubs from Yankee Stadium and entered their official web site, I have the ability to enter the seat number and a photograph of the field would pop up taken from the angle and perspective of the seat. It is not a high priority in my life, but after two months I still can not find this feature on the site. I am a persistent fellow and I do not intend to be outdone by a machine. Yet as I ponder that standpoint, machines are an extension of our own inventiveness and manifest the results of our own creative abilities. It is an interesting concept that if I purchase this book that purports that it will broaden my awareness and skew my perspective of universal web design by taking into account accessibility considerations I will simultaneously be admitting a lack of my own awareness and a lack of self creativity. I admit that by sporadically entering the New York Yankees' web site over the past two months just to locate a place where I can enter my seat number does appear to be rather a waste of time better well spent on more loftier things. However, this seemingly mundane exercise and defilement of one's purpose in life did accomplish two things. Firstly, its stands as a testament that the New York Yankees' web site is in dire need of analysis and overhaul. Secondly, I found out where to get their daily box scores. Honestly however, this book is good for those who are slowly beginning to acquaint themselves with the potential of good web page design. Captivating the user and directing them in such a way to utilize the full potential of the site by having addressed all factors and judiciously incorporating them into the site is prudent and necessary. Still, I regard a good portion of what this book offers to be common sense.tivating the user and directing them in such a way to utilize the full potential of the site by having addressed all factors and judiciously incorporating them into the site is prudent and necessary.

Being a Civil War buff I bought this book several years ago attracted and intrigued by the title. It had never occurred to me that with all the horrors, suffering and death on America's battlefields during the Civil War that the emergence of ghosts and related supernatural haunts would come to surface. The particular story that I remember most strikingly was \\"The Night Train Passes.\\" It is all about the reappearance of Abram Lincoln's funeral train. It is spooky. This entire book is spooky. There is something about the images of the Civil War that makes this collection of stories so intriguing, personally haunting yet poignant. I highly recommend this book.	2000-10-24

Obviously it was at that time, myself still being in school very challenging reading for me. However, I was able to recognize brilliance over hypocrisy. Robin Wood has ever since remained the preeminent authority on Hitchcock's films. He has honestly admitted that his perspectives on some of his analysis have changed. This is not an outright statement that has had a change of heart or acquired a new taste in the aesthetics of Hitchcock's films. On the contrary, through ongoing analysis he has come even closer to the secret of Hitchcock's mastery of his art. An artist creates a work. A great portion of that work is constructed with conscious deliberate thought, some is intuitive and a small portion may be subconscious. Robin Wood, I believe has showed a continuum in his analysis of Hitchcock's work. Wood continues to explore the avenues of the intuitive and subconscious nature of Alfred Hitchcock, which manifests itself in his films. To this end I believe Wood has devoted a good portion of his life.	2000-10-23

He is a man of great integrity and his knowledge on the subject of James Bond is boundless. He is one of a handful of people in the world that is truly a James Bond authority.<br />This book covers each of the Broccoli / United Artists James Bond films. These are the official films. The book gives objective information on each title written with editorial doses of interest which maintains a consistency of perspective from cover to cover. There are no favorites in the traditional sense. The authors know very well that no filmmaker or group of filmmakers ever intentionally makes an inferior motion picture. It is all a matter of how well the filmmakers combine their efforts and produce a finished product. The focus of the book is the filmmaking, not hype or glamour. The Bond films have always maintained a high ideal of production standards and this book examines that process.<br />Besides the filmmaking this book also examines the James Bond phenomena from product merchandising (including books, toys, music, videos, games, etc.) to the cultural impact of Ian Fleming's hero. It even covers such offshoots such as the animated TV series \\"James Bond Jr.\\" The book also contains key interviews with members of the acting and production crews. It is also profusely and beautifully illustrated with many colour photographs.<br />I highly recommend this book. And take from me, Philip Lisa is more than just a contributor on this publication. Being the consummate professional he never told me who wrote what, but having read this book several times I think I can. Just don't ask me. James who?	2000-10-20

His name is an American Icon. He is world renowned for the unforgettable images that he brought to the silver screen, which captured the imaginations of young and old alike. Those images and characters he created have transcended the movie houses they were originally shown in and have leaped into literature, art, toys and educational entertainment parks touching almost every part of the globe.<br />The creator of the iconic character, Mickey Mouse, both as an illustrator and supplier of Mickey's original voice, brought together a highly specialized yet diversely talented team of artists and craftsmen whose works will endure for all mankind.<br />There was something always very characteristic on whatever Walt Disney had a personal hand in. Even his live action films that he personally produced have that unique Walt Disney look and feel about them. Their sights and sounds have an enduring quality about them which remains with anyone that has viewed them. <br />Through the end of my adolescence there began a time when I began to feel that Walt's films were nothing more than some cornball kid's stuff and were nothing more than mildly entertaining fluff. However, in retrospect I now see the emotional charged craftsmanship that went into his films. They were always interesting, but more importantly they always sparked the imagination and some such as \\"Old Yeller\\" brutally challenged the younger viewer to prepare for the responsibilities of adulthood. <br />I think that while Walt was alive especially heading into the 1960s he was beginning to become taken for granted and his legacy was somewhat cynically scrutinized as something archaic and out of step with the \\"real world.\\" I think that today as members of the \\"real world\\" we have to take a look back and see the values that one man cherished and wanted to share with all the people on this planet. We are losing those values ever so quickly cloaked in a stealth-like path to ultimate despair. It is good to see that one man's vision and hope that the future generations of society would not abandon those values, but cling to them and nurture them. That vision is not dead.<br />Walt is remembered. This book was very inspiring and uplifting. It was good to read anecdotes from people who knew him and were touched by his devotion to his ideals through his approach to his many endeavors. Annette Funicello, Dean Jones, the Sherman brothers, Kurt Russell, Hayley Mills and many others were very kind to share their fond experiences with Walt. They remind us that he is indeed not forgotten and has left an indelible mark on all those that he touched as a man and through his works. I highly recommend this book.	2000-10-20

If you viewed Martin Scorsese's 1991 remake of \\"Cape Fear\\" and then viewed J. Lee Thompson's 1962 original, one may be disappointed. The remake was frank, graphic and to the point. The original was merely suggestive by today's standards, but in 1962  \\"Cape Fear\\" was considered nothing less than prurient sensationalism. It was good filmmaking just the same. This book: \\"The Year of Decision: 1846\\" is an example of the later.<br />1846 is a world away from today, the year 2000. This book was written at a time when the United States was preparing for and ultimately entered World War II. Yet even then the dust of the Western parries, plateaus and deserts was just finally settling. The second generations of those adventurous individuals who traversed westward across this great land though aged and dramatically reduced in number were still around. Today, like so much of the pristine west they are no longer.<br />This book may seem somewhat biased for its views on historical events, as it appears to recall some of those events with an intuitive flair for the dramatic. However, that is exactly the strength of this book. One should never be satisfied with a cardboard assembly line approach to writing history. That approach has no depth sparks no interest and never challenges the imagination of the reader.<br />Any notable work on history should evoke the time and place of the events and transport the reader into that historical dimension. DeVoto accomplishes this brilliantly with his own wry and overtly honest yet subtle style that draws the reader in like a shill at a Ferro table. His writing reminds me very much of that employed by Frank X. Tolbert in his excellent \\"An Informal History of Texas\\" published in 1951, a very captivating a picturesque depiction and interpretation of the times.	2000-10-12

It contains the detail and depth of character evident in his \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" that was a top-notch adaptation of the screenplay. And that is what the cinematic THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH does. THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH atypically required a book to make sense of the confusing plot mixing the King family with Swiss Bankers, terrorists and British intelligence. In retrospect there are many intriguing elements of the film that somehow go undeveloped. The film's structure is more character based than driven by plot. Unfortunately, there was a great opportunity to delve deeper into the psyche of the central characters, but that opportunity went by the wayside. On a more practical note, it seemed rather incongruous to have M go out into the \\"field\\" and end up a captive behind bars in a seaside estate. This is completely out of character for the resourceful and worldly M characterized in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. Raymond Benson corrects the faults of THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH in bravura fashion. This is an edge of your armchair James Bond novel from prolific author Raymond Benson. I loved his James Bond Bedside Companion. This is a very good Bond novel and serious rates critical attention for its story, literary style and attention to detail.	2000-09-23

The worldly agent that  Ian Fleming created is nowhere to be found in this novel. The nauseating  scent of smoke and sweat of the casino are absent. Bond is reduced to  drinking Perrier water!<br />The villain, Anton Murik Laird of Murcaldy, is a  weak version of Hugo Drax. He is an unworthy opponent, even for a watered  down Bond.<br />Gardner's style as a writer is about as dry as a billiards  table. Being dry isn't necessarily a bad thing. He's just plain flat-out  boring and stating that he even has style is a bit of a compliment.<br />Gardner is no Ian Fleming. That statement goes without question in my  mind. However, it is an unfair comparison. If he had copied Fleming's style  everyone would shout, \\"copycat!\\" If only Gardner had come up with something  innovative yet retained the qualities that Fleming had endowed on his  character and injected into his \\"world of 007.\\"<br />The only successful  successor to Fleming was the late Kingsly Amis with his only Bond novel  &quot;Colonel Sun.&quot; He could have been called a \\"copycat\\" of the  Fleming style.  Amis however, was a fervent Fleming aficionado and his  novel was more in homage to the author.<br />Gardner just does not have the  Fleming connection and that will work against any author who tries to pick  up where Fleming left off.	2000-09-06
