One of the reviewers on Amazon.com I think correctly described this book as \\"bathroom reading.\\" I agree wholeheartedly. The book reads like an encyclopedia more than anything else, and it's not recommended to read it in large sections (like I did) because you'll be bored quickly. Apparently its part of a series, and this one focused exclusively on language (Where did the term Peeping Tom come from? What does it mean to mind your Ps & Qs?, etc). I suppose if I read a few explanations every day while in the bathroom the novelty wouldn't have wore off so quickly. Probably a good bet for those word-lovers more than anyone else. <br />	2005-10-03

As a native Connecticut resident, I found this collection of tales especially interesting since I've encountered many of the places featured. The author, a former professor at Eastern Connecticut University, complied this book with the help of students from his folklore class. Since folklore is passed down orally, some of the tales read unevenly in textual format, and I think would have came across better had I heard them from an actual storyteller. However, I liked how there was a variety of tales, from stories of famous Connecticut residents, to supernatural stories, to explanations on how towns, lakes, and other landmarks got their unusual names. Overall, a pretty good collection that spans the state. <br />	2005-10-03

I picked up this book thinking it was a true story, I put it down still thinking maybe author Stephen Clarke had drawn on his own life a bit. Maybe it was the cover quote which tipped me off, reading \\"There are lots of French people who are not at all hypocritical, inefficient, treacherous, in tolerant, adulterous or incredibly sexy....They just didn't make it into my book.\\" C'mon, that has to make you at least crack a grin. (Except maybe if you're French). The author's alter ego, Paul West, is an Englishman dropped in the middle of Paris knowing un peu francais. West spends the next nine months trying (pretty much in vain) to get a French chain of British tearooms off the ground. Of course, this is when he isn't busy hitting on Parisian women, being jerked around by his work colleagues, or trying to overcome culture and language to order a normal-sized beverage. I hope the author is working on a sequel, because I'd like to see Paul again. (Maybe he can go to America this time?) <br />	2005-10-03

I've read other books that fall into this chick lit sub-category (Bergdorf Blondes, etc) and found that there is a thin line between love and hate of the uber-rich who star in these stories. The protagonist usually is someone who is not \\"born\\" into the lifestyle, so we can usually side with her. However, if the protagonist is just completely clueless, well, do we have to? In this story, a group of heiresses decide to take Julia Pearce, a salesgirl, under their wing...until something better comes along to distract them at least. Julia, who was supposed to be so \\"down to earth\\" doesn't bat an eyelash when her new \\"friends\\" get her a promotion, a makeover, and a fake pedigree. Add in some more stock characters (like the token gay best friend) and you've got the bulk of the story. Can anyone else see how this will end? Sure, chick-lit can be formulaic sometimes, but come on here ladies! <br />	2005-10-03

Sammy Hill is a health-care policy advisor to Robert Gary, a senator from her home state of Ohio, who has little time for a social life. She spends her little spare time with her Japanese fighting fish (which almost always seem to be on the brink of death), or making friends with telemarketers. Then Aaron Driver enters the picture. He's sexy, he's a speechwriter, and did I mention he's sexy? However, there is a bit of a problem. Aaron works for Senator Gary's top rival. Can Sammy risk a relationship with the employee of her sworn enemy? I really seemed to like this book for several reasons. Sammy was not your typical chick-lit heroine. She had brains and a personality. Also, some of her experiences with Aaron paralleled some experiences I was having with my own life at the time. The only real downside was I thought some of the political portions of the text to be boring, or highly unlikely to happen. Then again, I'm not the daughter of a former VP, so who knows?	2005-09-17

The narrator is a hotel employee who finds himself pulling double shifts.

Yet when it came to the chapters about hair removal and clothing, I was bored senseless. Is it, however, fascinating to see how our definition of \\"beauty\\" has changed over the years.

Second, I thought the premise sounded interesting. Cyn takes over another women's identity, who has wronged her in the past. I was pretty disappointed on both fronts. The whole advertising business aspect wasn't very realistic, even for a chick-lit book. As far as the plotline goes, the author tried way too hard to make Cyn likable. I ended up hating her because she was so gosh darn nice. The whole identity-stealing sounded great, but came out pretty lame as well. A below par fluffy read.	2005-08-02

While in theory a book about debunking or confirming old wives' tales sounds fairly interesting, the setup of this book lead to lots of repetition. Several of the tales were too similar to each other to really merit separate explanations. Others I had never heard of before, or have since been debunked as pure folly since the book's publication (I think it was '87). The authors also tried to be rather cutesy and make jokes which usually left me rolling my eyes. An interesting book to skim, but I wouldn't recommend reading big sections at once as I did.	2005-08-02

I picked up this book on a whim when I saw it under the \\"new non-fiction\\" at my library. And I'm glad I did. The author, a journalist, decided to spend one year teaching \\"American-style journalism\\" in Kyrgyzstan as part of the Fulbright program. Her journey at first paints a picture of a place many of us have probably heard little about. She tells us, for example, of the struggle to find edible \\"non-delicacies\\" in a country where customarily goat brain is served to guests. The author and her husband had also planned to travel extensively around the region, but then 9/11 struck. Instead of ditching what they considered a \\"once in a lifetime\\" opportunity, they proceeded on their trip to Afghanistan. The author's encounters with the people of these countries, as well as others, including Iran, Iraq, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan show us how very alike- and different we are. She also tries to paint a picture of how these countries view the USA, before and after the attacks of 9/11. My only gripe with this book is I felt the end, where she traveled across Russia, China, and Vietnam, seemed a bit rushed, and I wasn't ready for the story to end.	2005-07-16

I selected this book for a class I was taking about \\"Medieval in the Modern.\\" It took me, someone who can devour a book in a day, almost two months to read. And I'm not blaming my slow plodding through the book on the length. I'm sure if I was interested, I could have whipped through it. Unfortunately, I wasn't. The story is a retelling of the Arthurian legends from the women's viewpoints, namely Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar. I often felt like the author was trying to make a page quota, because there were hundreds of pages of dialogue (lots of inter) that could have been taken out. The beginning bored me. The middle bored me further. The end picked up and got me interested for a while. However, overall, I was pretty disappointed. I don't think I'll be picking up anymore of the author's books.	2005-05-23

I've read quite a few memoirs, and this one was satisfactory. It follows the author from her hippy childhood on the Upper West Side in the `70s to early adulthood.

It tells the story of the author's childhood growing up in Czechoslovakia. In a ten year span, we see all of her adventures being the child of dissents parents in a small town, as well as witness her heartbreaks. Woven into the story is plenty of Czech history and culture, which made the setting come that much more alive. The characters in the book were also conveyed wonderfully. Her family, neighbors, and classmates seemed to come alive. The only downside I found was a couple of times I felt a bit lost with the discussion of Czech politics, and sometimes the story moved quite slowly. However, I'm actually interested in reading more Czech authors now!	2005-04-11

This book focuses on the monster from the original poem, Grendel. While I liked the fact that the character was developed more and made sympathetic, the structure of the book was a little strange. I also felt like sometimes I was missing was the author was trying to say. I think this is quite problematic since the book is marketed to a young adult audience and I'm out of that age group. I would only recommend reading this if you read Beowulf and want a different perspective, otherwise, leave it.	2005-03-05

Faith DiNapoli is the second child of four and the daughter of a father who speaks heavily accented English and a mother who chain-smokes, both of whom can not get along with each other. The inside of the book flap said we were supposed to be able to follow Faith's life from eight to eighteen, but most of the time I couldn't tell what age she was supposed to be. I think this was a combination of lots of flashbacks and the fact Faith never seemed to really grow up. Lots of secondary characters were thrown in who we were supposed to care about, while little was said about her actual family. I got bored. A lot.  <br />	2005-01-29

Four seniors, Tom, Paul, Charlie and Gil are just weeks away from graduating. While most seniors are simply itching to live, Paul has yet to finish his senior thesis, about a mysterious 15th-century manuscript, the Hypnerotomachia Poliphil (which is a real book). It turns out our narrator Tom also has some ties to the book, for his late father was a Renaissance scholar who spent his life trying to decipher the embedded codes in its pages. It is the Hypnerotomachia who brought Tom and Paul together in the first place, but will it now drive them apart? Add some murder and romance into the roommate's quest to unlock the Hypnerotomachia's mystery and you've got a fast-paced thriller. It's a bit dense at times, and I did have to read some parts over and over to get them, and I also felt the story went on a bit too long and could have been chopped down.

The translation from Old English (written on the left side of every page) to modern English (written on the right) was done quite well, and the translator did a good job of keeping the essence and rhythm of the original poem intact. The story deals with three main battles in Beowulf's life: with the monster Grendel, Grendel's mother, and a dragon.

Persepolis follows the life of the author as she is growing up in Iran amid wars and uprisings.

Personally, I liked Maus better, but this could be because I read both parts of Maus, while I have yet to get my hands on the second volume of Persepolis.

Originally, the stories in the book were published as a weekly newspaper column in England, so it's more a collection of essays rather than a cohesive novel about his experiences.

Enter in his crazy cast of friends: Paula (a Freshman at Julliard herself), Kelly (Ed's cheerleader girlfriend), Doug (his football player crush), Natie (a nerd with high aspirations) and Ziba(a Middle Eastern beauty) who are willing to help him do whatever it takes to get in to the school of his dreams. Besides being laugh-out-loud funny, the book takes on issues without making them the main storyline (Ed's relationship with his Dad, his sexuality). I would love to see what Ed's up to now. I want a sequel! :)	2004-12-26

However, I think it's easier to connect with a book when you identify with one of the characters. And the main characters here were certainly not identifiable for me. There's the main character, Alice, who is married to Joe, who is a serial cheater, who is currently cheating with Josie, one of his co-workers. When Joe and Josie are discovered messing around in the office, Joe gets transferring across the ocean...to New York City. For Joe, a new city means...new women. And Alice is happy to play away at their country house in Connecticut, which was previously owned by an author, Rachel, whose husband was also cheating on her, and she wrote a book on it, which scandalized the town. (I don't see why that's important, but the author seems to think so.) Alice and Joe I never really cared for as a couple. I wanted him to get caught, and I wanted her to use her head to catch him! I also saw some of the \\"twists\\" coming from miles away. I would be willing to try another book by the author because I've heard good things about her, but I wouldn't read this one again. <br />	2004-12-15

While this book about the candy industry was written in a nice, easy to read style, I found myself getting a bit bored sometimes. I love candy as much as the next person, but I don't get the same sort of pleasure the author does about describing how a candy bar is made. In fact, I get sort of confused quite honestly. That said, I did love the author and he made me laugh several times with tales of his obsession.	2004-12-02

It makes for an interesting (usually) mish-mash of stories about why things are the way they are in America. Touching on topics from America's obsessions with lawns to how air conditioning has affected politics, there are some interesting entries here to read just because you're an American. Other chapters seem like they are more geared to people with a specific interest (and written as if they are too, I was totally lost during the guitar chapter). Worth a look I guess.	2004-12-02

Melissa, an American, goes to England to work as an au pair for the Haig- Ereildoun family after loosing her job and calling off her wedding. The writing style is strange (it's not written in a diary format) and it seemed like it was happening many years ago...I actually couldn't tell the exact time period it was set in. There really is no plot, so it's hard to describe it much further. The only thing I did like was the whole culture shock Melissa went through. That's about it.	2004-11-30

I thought it was going to be more interesting than it was. The more I read, the sillier the whole concept of being a debutante seemed. I also felt like the author copied the style of the reporters who used to report on debutante balls.

As someone who enjoys original fairy tales, I had some pretty high hopes for this book. It didn't meet them. Ed, a troll who lives in the woods comes across a young boy who has run away named Christian. Unable to find his family, Ed adopts him. Christian grows and soon tires of his non-existent social life. He yearns to go to the castle across the river, partly because of the excitement, partly because he has a crush on the young Princess Marigold, who he has been spying on with his telescope. Ed reluctantly agrees to let him go, and before he knows it, he befriends Marigold and finds out her secret. Several times I just wanted to flip to the last page and go \\"I knew it!\\" but I kept reading. I think the best part of the book was the beginning.

In this story of the near future, American companies have taken over most of the world. You take the last name of your employer. You want a crime solved? You'll get billed directly from the government. In this strange screwed-up world lives the equally messed-up cast of characters including Jennifer Government to Hack Nike to those two John Nikes that I kept confusing! Hack Nike is approached by the John Nikes to sign a contract to help with marketing their new line of sneakers. Only after does Hack realize he has agreed to help set off Nike's Mercury campaign, which involves shooting Mercury-buyers to up Nike's \\"street cred.\\" Hack goes running to the cops, but the cops in this world think he wants help...in hiring someone to do the killings for him. Enter the rest of the cast: Violet, Hack's computer whiz girlfriend; Billy NRA, a supposed trained assassin; Buy Mitsui, a stockbroker; and Jennifer Government, whose on a personal quest to nail one of the John Nikes. While the author's idea was very original, and I liked the shifting views from chapter to chapter, I sometimes found myself so confused I would have to read several chapters over. I think the fewer times you break off from reading, the better in keeping all the companies straight.	2004-09-12

She unwittingly finds herself involved in the middle of a faerie war between the two courts- the Unseelie and Seelie. She also is strangely attracted to a mysterious knight named Roiben.

Robert Farcett, the young doctor that saved Montmorency after his near-fatal burglary, regularly takes him to lecture halls around Victorian London to show off his medical expertise. It is at one of these lectures that Montmorency hears about the new sewage system and an idea forms in his head.  Before long, Montmorency is conjuring up a plan to use the underground network to help him with his burglaries, but he needs a partner...or does he? This novel had great style and characterization.

After reading \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" last year and loving it, I decided I should check out more of the author's vivid writing style. This novel did not disappoint. Much like \\"Girl...\\" the book revolves around the creation of a great work of art, this time the famous Lady and the Unicorn cycle tapestries. (Which my copy of the book only had small cutouts in the front cover in which to view tapestries.) The rotating viewpoints (which I loved and wished they had touched on a few other characters as well) tell the story of Nicolas des Innocents who has been commissioned by the Parisian nobleman Jean Le Viste to design a series of large tapestries for his great hall. Nicolas ends up falling for Le Viste's young daughter, which only causes more problems. We follow the tapestries and the fascinating stories of the people creating them from Paris to Brussels and back. Good historical fiction recommendation.	2004-08-15

I've read some of the author's other retellings and was a bit disappointed with this one. We meet Pan, the half goat/half god who basically flits around the woods with other mythical creatures all day. It isn't until he meets Iphigenia and falls in love with her that his life really seems to have a purpose. People with any background in Greek mythology know that Pan had a curse placed on him upon birth that he will never be loved in return. His quest to find Iphigenia again then seems a bit fruitless to the reader, but what we don't realize is that he may be able to save her from her father's mission to sacrifice her. This book needed more detail. I felt it was lacking in some other areas as well, as the plot meandered quite a bit. I did like how the author included a family tree at the beginning so we understood how everyone was related however.	2004-08-15

What if your father brought home some letters found in your ancestral palazzo in Italy that seemed to reveal a forbidden love affair? Would you tuck the letters away without a second thought? Or, like the author of this amazing book, would you decide to research the story further and write a book about lovers' lives? If this sounds like the foundation of a great story, you should definitely pick up this book. The author is related to Andrea Memmo, a son of a prominent ancient Venetian family who fell deeply in love with Giustiniana Wynne, the illegitimate daughter of a British father and a Venetian mother. The letters in the author's possession, as well as other letters and articles he was able to view, help create the framework of Andrea and Giustiniana's 18th-century meeting at the home of a mutual friend and the long love affair that followed. Separately their lives would be interesting enough, with friends like Casanova popping up and trips all over Europe. Combined together, their quest to be together is a riveting read. Andrea and Giustiniana's adventures take you into the final days of the great Venetian society of the past.	2004-08-15

What about the women involved? How did Helen feel? What would it have been like to be Cassandra and have to watch your brothers head off into battle? The author takes you there. While personally I believe she could have included even more viewpoints of other women, and switched back and forth between Helen and Cassandra, the author opted to start with Helen's life as a child and switch to Cassandra's viewpoint after Helen arrives in Troy. While many would think this would make the book a bit unbalanced, it actually works quite well, as we see Cassandra's feelings towards Helen greatly change over the many years Troy is under siege. Overall, a pretty enjoyable read.	2004-08-15

Best bud Billy tries to hook her up with Dick Davenport, but Layla thinks he might be a little too uptight for her. (He wears shoes with tassels for goodness sakes!) She then meets a broody mysterious musician named Frank, but everything isn't always what it seems with him. Layla continues to try and get back on track with her career, while constantly finding herself running into Mr. Davenport, whom she seems to be unable to get out of her head. While some parts are a tad predictable, I really enjoyed Layla's cast of friends, which besides flamboyant Billy, include Austrian cook Gustav and bartender Dina.	2004-08-15

First made for a young girl in Maine, the doll travels around the world and back passing from one youngster to another and recounts her journey along the way. Since the book was written in 1929, it gives it a certain charm to the author?s writing, at the same time though; the author occasionally uses terms that would not be considered ?politically correct? today. I know many older books do this, but since this book is geared towards children, I think I might substitute in more appropriate words if reading to a youngster. However, despite this, I found this book a cute story that gives you a look at how people were viewed and supposedly acted during the 1800s, where the story takes place.	2004-07-23

Yet, in many parts of the world today, slavery isn't dead. In this novel, we meet Mende, a young Sudanese tribal girl growing up happily with her family. The first third of the book explores Mende's childhood among her tribe, the Karko of the Nuba Mountains. Then one night, everything changes. Her village is attacked by Arab raiders. Huts are torched, men killed, women raped and children rounded up to be sold off later as slaves. Mende is among them. We see how Mende struggles to survive as a slave girl and horrors she was forced to go through. Eventually, Mende travels to London as a slave, where it is that she is finally able to make a break for freedom. While Mende's first hand account is great, describing a young woman's life as she matures from a child to an adult under horrible circumstances, something I disliked about this book was that towards the end, Damien Lewis seemed to take over the writing and this made it seem less personal. Also, because of Mende's age at certain points of the novel, I feel like some spots were not as detailed as later chapters. These two minor gripes shouldn't deter you from reading an unbelievable story of a resilient young woman.	2004-07-13

What happens when an adult man and woman suddenly decide to seek out their biological mothers?  Joanna Trollope introduces us to a wide cast of characters in this novel, and examines the effect the main characters', siblings Nathalie and David, sudden pressing search for their biological mothers has on those who surround them. It all starts when Steve, Nathalie's common-law husband has a friend at work whose girlfriend wants to interview adult adoptees. After talking with her, Nathalie decides she wants to find out about her mother, and convinces her David, to search for his biological mother at the same time. Instead of looking at adoption just from the view of the children who were given up, Trollope skillfully shows us how Nathalie and David's children, spouses, parents, co-workers and biological mothers and their families deal with the two's hunt.

What if the story was real? In this incredible novel by Louise Murphy the story is changed slightly, but the main elements are still there: the evil stepmother, the bread crumbs, the \\"witch\\". Hansel and Gretel aren't the real names of the two Jewish children who are left in the woods during WWII by a desperate father and stepmother trying to flee the Nazis. Their real names must remain secret, so the young children will be hopefully be taken in and suspected to be Christian.  The first person they come upon in the woods is Magda, a midwife who lives alone in the hut near a village. Magda is suspected to be a witch by the villagers and the children alike, but she agrees to take them in and feed them despite their fears. As the war nears its' end, we see how the Nazis stationed in the nearby village frantically try to keep control of the villagers and remain true to their goals of wiping out \\"undesirables\\". Madga suspects the children are Jews, but has vowed to keep them safe at all costs. The wonderful weaving of the main themes of Hansel and Gretel with a survival story during WWII makes for a simply amazing read. The one minor problem I had was that ending didn't wrap up everything as well as I would have liked. Otherwise, a unique work that I urge you to read.	2004-07-03

While I might not have picked it up on my own, I found that it wasn't that bad. Newman tells us stories of the working poor in Harlem, many who work at the local &quot;Burger Barn&quot;. Their struggles do really grip you and give you a different picture of these people. While a couple of chapters were a little bogged down in numbers, and Newman assumes her readers are familiar with some aspects of welfare and such, overall, the book was an interesting look into how people try to &quot;make it&quot;, that is easily accessible to most.	2004-06-26

She's not gorgeous; she doesn't have a close group of girlfriends to chat about men with, in fact, she's not really actively looking for a man. When Alice meets Ray Russo one day and manages to talk him out of a nose job, she never guesses he will want to start a relationship with her. Can Alice trust Ray? Does she even like him? And why would someone outgoing like Ray like someone who's basically a social misfit like her? While I admit sometimes it was difficult to read about a main character with so little self-esteem, the others around Alice kept the book from being dragged down too much in Alice's depressed moods. Not bad, not great, but different nonetheless.	2004-06-26

As a story in itself, I found it just okay. We are first introduced to Anidori-Kiladra Talianna Isilee, Crown Princess of Kildenree when she is just a young girl, and helped by her aunt, discovers she has the ability to speak to animals. As the first child born to the King and Queen, she is supposed to be first in line to the throne, but Ani (as she is called) doesn't really feel like she fits in. After her father dies, the Queen announces that Ani's younger brother will take the throne and Ani will be send to marry the prince of Bayern, a nearby country that Kildenree has only a \\"civil\\" relationship with. Ani, her guards and her lady-in-waiting, Selia, set off on the long journey to Bayern, only to find out that Selia has other plans. Ani eventually arrives in Bayern, but must be careful to blend in. She ends up taking a job as goose girl. While I think this first book by the author was good, it wasn't GREAT. Too many characters and the fact it dragged on in some spots made me not like it as much as I could have. I think I might check out the next book by Hale however, because it centers on interesting and little developed character that appeared in this book.	2004-06-19

This book, a collection of short poems, tells the story of a little known event during WWII. In 1942, Japan attacked the Aleutian Islands. Vera, the narrator tells of how the native people, the Aleuts, were removed from the islands and relocated to the Alaskan mainland. The military claimed it was for their own protection. Over the course of three long, hard years, we see how Vera and her fellow people deal with prejudice (because of their resemblance the Japanese) and daily life in an internment camp. Hesse is wonderful at conveying many emotions to the reader. Though it was a short read, it made me want to learn more about the Aleutian Islands and maybe attempt to read more poetry, and that's saying a lot!	2004-06-19

In fact, every other book I've tried to read in the genre I've never finished. This collection was actually not so bad. The stories take place in Soul City, a urban black utopia of sorts. Some of the stories left me a bit bored, but others were good. I got the chance to meet Toure and he read some of the stories that will be in his next book which centers around more residents of Soul City. I'll be sure to pick it up because it seems like he is only maturing as a writer.	2004-05-29

This was my first reading of one of Robin Maxwell's books, and I must say it won't be my last. I already can't wait to read the next two! However, I'm getting ahead of myself. This novel moves back and forth in time from Queen Elizabeth in the present, to her mother, Anne Boleyns', life in the past. Elizabeth is presented with a diary that Anne kept, which chronicles her life right up to very end. Apparently, it was Anne's wish that eventually Elizabeth would read her writings. Elizabeth finds any time she can to sit down and get a glimpse into her mother's life. It's also an escape for her, for in the present she is advised to marry quickly and stop her relationship with Robin Dudley, which is deemed inappropriate. Elizabeth gets to know the parents she never really knew, and uses lessons her mother learned in her current affairs. The writing is detailed, and brings you into both women's lives. And the author never makes the mistake of confusing the reader by not clearly separating the two stories. A recommendation for historical fiction fans.	2004-05-29

And when I did get around to reading it...I wasn't impressed. Yes, the author's ideas are scary: That in the future, firemen set fires to burn books. One firefighter, Guy Montag, begins to look at his life more closely and discovers how empty it is. He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation. I did see some good messages in this vision of the future, but I felt a little bit cheated too, because I wanted to get a better glimpse at this society that spawned this fire fighter-book burners. I'm not debating if it should be a classic or not, I'm just saying it was not personally a very good book to me.	2004-05-29

I found this collection of 15 short stories, all dealing with the central theme of desire, to be alright. Perhaps one of my favorite things the author did was take characters from literature and incorporate them in stories. Hester Prynne, Lady Macbeth, Oedipus, and Scheherazade all make appearances. One thing I disliked was that it seemed that the author wanted to make each story so different from the others that you almost felt you were reading a book full of stories from different authors and it feel like it interrupted the rhythm the author had just set up in the previous story.	2004-05-22

Except even thought it seemed promising, I never felt I could connect with the main character. Courtney Von Dragen Smith is starting her senior year of high school, and it's far from perfect. Her boyfriend has broken up with her because he is going to college 30 minutes away and doesn't want to have a \\"long-distance relationship\\". One of her ex's friends is flirting with her. And oh yeah, her family is strange, of course. She decides to not date for the entire year and also run for vice president of student council. These events and others are detailed in her journal, which skips all over the place. The journal follows her up until the New Year, when I felt like all the stuff that happened should have been put in a longer time frame. It also make the reader feel like they were hanging to stop at such a awkward point. My last problem with the book was the main character. She just wasn't that likable! There are better teen books written in this journal style.	2004-05-22

In this book, I felt she faltered. She tells the story of the Greek Sirens (which are pictured to be mermaids).Sirena, the main character, knows that she is cursed, being half-human. The only way to lift the curse is to convince a man to mate with them. Then, she will become immortal. Sirena decides to separate from the other Sirens and finds a castaway alone on an island. They are initially afraid of each other, but begin to fall in love. Will Sirena want to be immortal after falling in love with a human man? I found the story dragging a lot, and perhaps because the story of the Sirens isn't as well known as some of Napoli's other retellings, it seemed a bit boring to me as well. I think she has written better.	2004-05-22

They join up with the Mayor's daughter (probably the best character) to try and solve the strange going ons the town is experiencing.

Clarissa gets what Clarissa wants, so landing Aaron shouldn't be a problem...should it?

It seems like Leslie's only outlet, and since her teacher promised never to read it, what's the harm in putting down personal stuff, like the fact she likes Jason? Jason isn't exactly your average boyfriend however. His first \\"date\\" with Leslie involves too much alcohol and it isn't until later that Leslie realizes she's been raped. Leslie continues to see Jason after this, seeing something in the much older and richer guy. His behavior just starts to escalate, and then a new English teacher turns over Leslie's journal to the principal. Leslie's scared for her life and so are the readers in this disturbing story of teenage relationship violence.	2004-04-20

Toby's had always been used to the fact that he never had a phone in his home or that his mother seemed to change her hair color and place of residence on a whim. Now that he's getting older, he begins to question his mother's behavior, and gets nothing in return. It isn't until Toby and his mom move to Idaho and Toby discovers, via the Internet, who his mother really is. I have to admit, when I found it, it was sort of anti-climactic. I also felt that the book ended rather strangely, with the author trying to wrap up all the loose ends and loose realism that way. If you're looking for a book about a family on the run, leave this book in the dust.	2004-04-20

She convinces her bosses that she should live in Prairie City for a year and sent \\"Quality of Life Reports,&quot; back home to show New Yorkers what life is like. Somehow that Lucinda from the beginning of the novel quickly finds herself with a house in the middle of nowhere, an irritating boyfriend, and his three children (from three different women) who float in and out of their lives.

The main character, Melissa Fuller, who works at New York Journal as the gossip columnist seems like a fun, genuinely nice person. Her main problem is she can't find a man, a good man that is. Then, one of her elderly neighbors is found in her apartment unconscious, apparently the victim of an attempted murder. Her only living relative is a playboy photographer named Max, who has MUCH better things to do they come to his aunt's apartment and watch after her animals. So what does he do? He asks an old college buddy John Trent, to fill in for him. John agrees, until he meets Melissa, and realizes she's the girl he's been looking for. Although a bit predictable in some spots, I found the novel pretty cute, and I liked how lesser characters, like Melissa's parents and John's sister-in-law were included. The only thing that really bothered me what the fact that sometimes the style of e-mail to tell a story made me feel like I didn't get to know the characters as well as I liked.

While it does indeed share some of the same themes of The Scarlet Letter, I think this novel is incredible in it own right. Wonderfully detailed, with lots of back-story included, helped me really get a good sense of place and the characters. The plot itself focuses on elite families in New York during the 1950s and the extremely successful law firm they run. The scandal at the very beginning (one of the powerful lawyer's son in laws has committed adultery) is only the very beginning. The writer explores the web of relationships between the families and all the secrets and lies their lives are built on. While some people complain that the author's writing is a bit old-fashioned, I personally think it added to the story, but I admit, I did have to look up a few words! Overall, quite an enjoyable read, and I will be checking out more of the author's work.	2004-03-20

The descriptions of Venice made it come alive, and the different viewpoints encompassed a wide variety of people from a visitor to the city to the mayor. You could really tell that the author wanted you to see that the city's upper-class life was fading in most of the stories. However, I had some problems as well. About three of the stories I didn't really &quot;get&quot;. They just seemed to make no sense whatsoever. I also found it odd she only wrote about four women, I had wished for more a balance there.

The illustrations are also much more detailed than a first thought, so make sure you take a good look at them.	2004-01-20

The story moves back and forth from Art's father's life in WWII Poland to 1980s New York. I felt that the drawings showing depictions of different races as animals put such a different spin on the Holocaust. Plus, when you think that the Nazis treated the Jews at \\"less than human\\" it seems to make sense on more than one level. I was eager to start the next book, for this book ends with Art's father arrives at Auschwitz.	2004-01-20

When most immigrants come to America from Ireland, they don't return. Frank McCourt's family did. After finding conditions in NYC less than desirable, especially when you have an alcoholic father who can't hold down a job, Frankie, who was born in America, and his family return to Ireland. His memoir of a family trying to survive during extreme poverty as he grows up is quite moving. However, for some strange reason, I felt the film, of the same name, did a better job of portraying Frankie's experience to me. Perhaps it had something to do with the author's style, which I sort of disliked. If you don't see the film, then you should read the book. And I really want to see what happens in the sequel, for you did really start to care for young Frankie and want to see if he will make it.	2004-01-15

I was a bit concerned that since this book was called a \\"Discworld\\" novel I may not understand it well, this being my first of Terry Pratchett's novels. I should not have worried, this book, which is aimed to teens, is great standing alone. It tells the story of Tiffany, a young girl, whose baby brother goes missing. With a little help from a witch, and some little (but extremly strong men) called the Wee Free Men she sets off on a quest to capture her brother from an evil Queen. I really adored Pratchett's writing style, it was very vivid. In fact, the whole book was good, except it dragged a bit in a couple of chapters near the end, and some areas I felt he skimped on details. I also loved how the Wee Free Men talked. I will be checking out his other work now!	2003-12-31

What follows is a battery of tests and then finally training, to become a spy. I'm not sure how much of the book is actually based on fact, but I found all Serena's training to be incredibly interesting. Besides being trained, we see Selena fall in love with Stan, another spy in training, or is he? About 75% of the book focused on Selena's job and the other 25% was on her personal life, so I found it harder to get attached to the characters. Her boyfriend, Stan, seemed like a particularly strange guy for her, but maybe it's because Selena's character wasn't explored so much, so I didn't feel like I really knew her. All in all, an entertaining read for anyone who has ever dreamt of being a spy, or has seen \\"The Recruit\\".	2003-12-29

Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother, who for some reason she hates. I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy, like why she hated her homeland so much.

This book is more or less a sort of handbook that Machiavelli wrote for future rulers. In it, he breaks down different styles of ruling, different military defenses, and many other things, all the while using historical examples. One of the reasons it has remained so popular is because of Machiavelli's lack of morals included in his ideas. In addition, the book is easy to read and interesting to most because rulers up to the last century had been known to read it. It's not exactly exciting reading, but it's surely interesting for those who like history.	2003-12-23

I feel like you know almost everything that is going to happen after the three witches appear.

Well, I read this in my Intro to Lit class. It was right after Frankenstein, so perhaps that made me like the book more than I normally would. Or maybe it was just Hawthorne's writing style. He tells us the story of Hester, a woman forced to wear the scarlet A for adultery in early Puritan America. How did they know she committed adultery? Her husband had not yet joined her in America and suddenly, she's pregnant. She refuses to reveal the father of her child. For the next couple of years we follow Hester, her daughter Pearl as she grows up isolated, and Pearl's father as well as Hester's newly returned husband...who has a new identity. Sometimes Hawthorne got so descriptive he went off-track, but for the most part, it's quite an interesting, almost soap opera storyline.	2003-10-23

With its rich teenagers who seemly never have parents around and can party all the time premise, I wanted to see what would come out of it. It wasn't a terribly bad story. The book centers on a group of teens, some belonging to the \\"elite\\" group, some not. The biggest event is the return of one girl that was mysteriously \\"kicked out\\" of boarding school and the jealously, lies, and backstabbing that ensue. A couple of characters are very stereotypical, but some of the girl's behavior was not that far off from what things were like when I was in high school. I knew this book was going to need a sequel, I almost felt like the whole thing was just an introduction sometimes, letting us get to know the characters and background history. Some people found the whole gossip girl idea annoying, but I thought it was kind of cute, and I'm wondering who it is! I'll read the next one and see if that draws me in further. A light and relaxing read overall.	2003-10-23

However, the times I laughed were probably almost as much as the times I wanted to cry or scream at the characters in the book. The book is not written in an actual diary format, which is nice. It follows Nanny, a college student trying to juggle her last year at NYU while at the same time caring for a adorable four year old named Grayer. Nanny takes us into a world many don't see, a world were children learn french at age 4, get coached to do interviews to attend private schools, and oh yes, hardly ever see their parents. As Nanny deals with getting Grayer to warm up to her, she also had to deal with his mother, the chilly Mrs. X. The woman expects Nanny to be her slave, available to her every whim. I liked the fact that we got to see Nanny outside the nanny enviroment, and deal with things like annoying roommates, guys, and her family. I would recommend this book, but just don't expect it to be all fun and games.	2003-09-24

His equal and him basically fight, go on &quot;adventures&quot; that seem to have no meaning, and visit people/gods with similar hard to pronounce names.

The fact that we never really learn any names or other characteristics that would set these characters apart makes it seem that the story could be ANY family.

Xenia returns to Rome with Ovid, becoming his muse and lover. When Ovid gains the Emperor's granddaughter as a patron for his newest (and he believes best work), lies and jealous thoughts starts to tear Ovid and Xenia apart.

This book takes the same time period, and tells of Mary's journey from living with her grandmother in England to traveling to America, and then finally settling down with a group of Puritans, many whom Mary had befriended. I think the journal style the book is written in is nice and helps the book's flow. I also like how Mary has relationships that really develop with many people, instead of just using them as props. It was a charming read, and I'm going to pick up the sequel soon.	2003-07-18

Elana is part of a highly advanced society, but they keep themselves secret to all societies below them- at whatever cost. During a mission to save a Youngling planet from another that is more advanced than it, Elana comes along, but she isn't a full-fleged Agent yet. Elana ends up working with her father and the boy she is to marry, as she helps try to perserve the planet with a native's help. What is science to Elana is \\"magic\\" to the people of this planet. We see things from Elana's viewpoint, the viewpoint of the invading society, and the viewpoint of the planet that is being invaded, who all have very different ways of thinking. Sometimes I felt the plot went off course talking about \\"responsibility\\" but otherwise, pretty interesting stuff.	2003-07-18

It's been three years since 15 year old Maya has been to India, the land where she lived as a child for several years with her grandmother. The book is descriptive, and makes you feel like you are transported there. Details are explained when the reader encounters something that may be hard for a non-Indian to understand. There are two main storylines, one dealing with the government that I didn't really care for, and one dealing with the larger story of Maya's connecting to her Indian self. The book got slighly more boring as it went on however.	2003-07-12

I guess I would have to call it \\"historical fantasy.\\" When I read the book, I was unaware that is was part of a larger series, or for that matter if any of the cultures portrayed were parts of actual ancient cultures. That said, Elske is the story of a young girl who escapes the \\"Wolfers\\", a barbaric band of people. She eventually ends up in Trastad, where she makes contact with a women rumored to be a queen, Beriel. I disliked Beriel, and felt that after Elske met her, that the book went downhill. I also wondered why the painting shown on the front of the book was chosen, for it is the same painting used for \\"Girl in a Pearl Earring\\", a much better work.	2003-07-12

It was a summer that Buddy Boyle would remember all his life. Only, one thing that irked me was it was never stated when exactly the book took place! Anyways, Buddy starts dating a rich girl, Skye Pennington, who summers in his hometown on Long Island. In order to impress Skye, he introduces her to his grandfather, who is pretty much not a part of his family's life. He grows to love his grandfather and spend more and more time with him, something his policeman father and mother (whose father is the one Buddy is getting close with) do NOT like. However, a writer that is at Skye's house is also looking for a SS Nazi, who he believes lives on Long Island. Everything comes together, and since you feel you really know Buddy, that makes it all the more heartbreaking. Not a bad read.	2003-07-05

Eventually, he ends up in America, which is still ruled by England, since the colonists lost the war. He is to live with his horrible uncle, but many twists and turns lead him to meet historical figures and find out where his loyalties lie.

The storyline of this book was that of one women who was Marie Antoinette's personal reader talking about 3 days back in 1789, as the French Revolution nears. It seemed rather promising. However, I had three major problems with the book. First, it had no solid plotline. Secondly, it went off on tangents that really made no sense. And last of all, it was so unengaging. I didn't care about the characters or the book at all. It took me forever to finish it, all the while HOPING it would get better. It apparently won a award in it's native country of France, perhaps something was lost in translation to English?	2003-07-05

Hannah has for as long as she remembers, lived at the edge of Tanglewood, where the local villagers come to visit her for her healing. Strange flowers grow in her hair, and she must pluck them out before they bloom and give the tea made from them to a wizard that lived in the Tanglewood. Hannah is content with her life, until she meets a brave knight, Foxkith, whom she falls in love with and wants to prevent from entering the forest, fearing he will never return like all the others. As soon as Hannah starts to challenge the Wizard and wonder about the life she has lived, it leads her on a journey with her talking friends: Badger, Magpie, the fox pups, and another voiceless friend. This book was wonderfully written, almost poetic at times. However, the author used many terms not in use commonly anymore, so I often had to look many up. I also found some of the ending very predictable, and I felt like the story could have wrapped up better. Maybe she's going for a sequel?	2003-06-25

Seeing what the Japanese made the Koreans do, as well as seeing the wonderfully developed characters grow and change made this book so interesting.

Emily, angry at her parents for bringing her around the world while they try to heal the sick children of third world countries, decides to go visit her uncle, who is visiting a nearby island. She never suspects the ferry ride won't make it to the other shore.

Before this book, I never knew about the Jewish ghetto in Prague, where Jews lived for hundreds of years, barely making much contact with the outside world, and when they did, facing great discrimination along the way. Rivka, the main character, is consistered to be part of the upper class in the ghetto. Her father is a doctor, and she is set to marry a man who everyone loves- except her, for she doesn't even know him. After seeing a bit of the outer world of the ghetto on an errand with her father, she decides she must go again...but this time she'll go as a Gentile boy.

She's quite infamous. You see, the Countess murdered over 650 young girls. She was said to bathe in their blood. This novel tells two stories, side by side. We have the tale of Elizabeth's life, filled richely with background history so maybe we can understand this woman's ways. The other story is of Drake Bathory-Kereshtur, a fictional descendant of Bathory who believes his last name will forever haunt him. The novel, rich with detail, moves back and forth between the past and the present. However, there is never really a SOLID connection made between the two. Yet, the author writes so well, it almost doesn't matter, for it's as if the stories could almost stand alone. It's a shocking read, but you can't put it down.	2003-06-20

However, some problems abound in this book. First off, the beginning of the book lets us know what happens at the end! Secondly, Anna is not a very likable person in the book, so many times, I found it hard to feel bad for her. Lastly, I felt the author could have expanded on details. Except for the strong personalities of Anna's grandmother and her teacher, Simon, many other characters seemed to be merely window dressing. Don't get me wrong, the book was not HORRID. However, I think some more details and concentrating on characters might have enhanced it. If you are interested about Anna Comnena, I would say read this book. It does have it's exciting parts, and the author at the end tells you what she changed for the sake of fictionalizing the story, which is a nice touch. I also like how she includes a family tree at the beginning, so we can see how everyone is related.	2003-06-09

Cyd Charisse is back on the west coast after being kicked out of a fancy east coast boarding school. That seems to be okay with her, for she befriends a woman in a nursing home, and finds Shrimp, who just might be the love of her life. However, things happened at boarding school that Cyd hasn't told anyone, and to get out of her problems, she had to call on someone she hasn't seen in years- her biological father. After an attempt to stay overnight at Shrimp's house goes awry, Cyd's parents decide it would do good for her to visit her father in New York, a man who was already married with two children when he got involved with Cyd's mother. The one thing that slightly annoyed me about this book was how much slang the author used. However, that's how many teens talk, so I suppose that helped make Cyd more realistic. You'll find yourself utterly wrapped up in Cyd's life and feeling her emotions along the way with this book. I'm hoping for a sequel.	2003-06-09

Anna lives in a village in England with her two young boys, quite peacefully. She even takes in a young tailor from England. However, when he dies mysteriously, not much is thought about it at first. Not until more and more begin falling sick, and the villagers realize what is among them- The Plague. Along with the priest's help, the villagers decide they must close themselves off from the rest of the world, in order to stop the Plague from spreading. The choices people make and the way people act when they no longer they have anywhere to turn is downright shocking, and extremely interesting too. My only problems with this book is that sometimes I felt Anna was too &quot;modern&quot; for her times, like she was telling the story in the modern day. I also did not find the ending very believable either. That said, I still think it is a book that shows you what it would have been like to be thrust into what seems like a horribly hopeless situation.	2003-05-31

Each handmaid's name is similiar, like Ofglen, etc... They have be reduced to be called &quot;of&quot; and then their master's name. Even if the world was not entirely believable, I still felt the story was good and hard to put down. Basically, in a time not far from when the author wrote (in the mid-80s) the United States of America has ceased to exsist. Government and religion are one in the same. Offred is better off than most, for she is a handmaid, in her words &quot;a walking womb&quot;. The handmaid's job is to be the carrier of children for a household, but the child is in no way hers. In fact, as soon as it is born, it gets placed into the arms of the wife of the house, who is treated like she just gave birth herself. Offred can still remember the past, and the people she left behind, her mother, her best friend, her husband, and her baby girl. Where are they? Did they survive? That ray of hope seems to keep Offred alive, that, and breaking the rules, which could land her in serious trouble...perhaps even strung up on the Wall as an example for others.	2003-05-13

Since the book was written in the 50's, I had trouble understanding some parts of it. (Hey! I'm an '80s child!) The book also all took place before the end of 1929. However, despite a few areas where I was confused, I found the book to be descriptive, sometimes a bit much in some areas (leading off into tangents that made no sense), but for the most part the details added to the reader's enjoyment in taking in the \\"Old World\\" of Italy, France, and England. The relationships between mothers and daughters are explored in great detail, and so are their often odd relationships with men. We can actually see a little of each woman in her mother.
