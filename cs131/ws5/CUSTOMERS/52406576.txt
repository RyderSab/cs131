This a very thorough book. I continue to like it more as time passes. It has detailed instructions for weight training, yoga , and aerobics. Who else will give you a superlative set of istructions for 'downward dog', and soon after do the same for  'overhead squats'?,(usually used as an adjuct to olympic weighlifters' training regimens).  Ilg understands that the three systems must each stand alone technically to be done properly, but he also understands the synergy of the three. To paraphrase one of Ilg's thoughts: Yoga gives one the body awareness to improve at weight training, and weight training gives one strength to improve at yoga. This a wonderful insight, and it's this type of thinking that adds up to making this sytem the single best for most fitness seekers. (( It's available from  Amazon's 'new & used'  sources  for  quite a low price. )) I only have one complaint: Many of Ilg's promotional photos  show him using  yoga blocks, but the book uses no blocks .	2005-10-11

Average age figures are moved by factors that affect the general population, such improved sanitation on the good side, or the 1918 influenza on the bad. 2/Every year you live past infancy statistically increases your chances to make it past average.

Yes, you can use more weight in positions of leverage advantage, not because you're working 'more muscle', but because of your limbs' positioning relative to gravity. When you finish a set of full-range  leg presses,(for example), you almost surely have strength left to do much more work in your somewhat straight-legged position. Does this mean that you should not work the weaker,  bend-legged position at all, as this book claims?  ////NO//// First of all, working the  <br />'weak range' to exhaustion is as effective as working the 'strong range',(it's how hard you work that matters in either case). Second, with the huge majority of people , the range you work is the only range that shows improvement, (I know, the author disagrees; he lies). Third, this almost-isometric style effects the central nervous system more than tissue.  If you only need strength in this one range, and don't want to change your appearance much, fine. But there's a problem even with that: Strength built without building tissue needs more maintenance than strength built along with  muscle, and is -so- specific to the mode of development as to be virtually useless in any other activity except the exercise that developed it! If you want to make proper use of this principle, try this: First work full-range reps until failure.  <br />Then, and only then, have the bar or machine arm assisted into 'strong range', and do a second set. This method requires much recuperation , and should only be done with one exercise in a session,(actually it's rarely needed at all, but certainly more valid than Power Factor.  The funny thing about Power Factor claims is that , if they want to mislead people with exercise principles, they haven't even chosen the most severe principle: You can -lower- more weight than you can -hold-. The best single way to develop strength is to have  a weight,(so heavy that you can't even hold it up!), assisted into the 'finished' position, and attempt to slow it's 'fall' as much as possible. Sure, it's crazy, dangerous, and unnecessary, but it works, (and it's full-range!).	2005-07-13

For instance; When early detection is credited for longer lives, consider that in most cases, all of the 'extended' life is the time that the test was moved up,(if you took the test a year sooner, you lived an 'extra' year), ie; no real increase. Consider that many medical tests,(biopsies and mammographies), actually force open 'scar'-sealed cancer cells that never would've entered the bloodstream if left alone. Consider that many types of cancer are known by your doctor to kill you at the same point in your painful chemo and radiation treatments as you would've died , without pain, if not treated at all, yet they do their best to keep that fact unknown to their patients. Consider how the medical establishment at large claim that diet has minimal effect on helping patients,(have you ever eaten hospital food)? If  physicians want us to stop patronizing the 'kooks', then they had better start learning, and passing on, the truth. (Add to Mr Lewandoski): You confuse the mean, median, and mode. If you remove infant deaths and deaths from formerly untreatable war injuries from the \\"average age\\" of death, the population often lived as  long as,(and in better shape than), our current 'averages', and without all the supposed help of our modern hospitals and nursing homes.

Yes, Mentzer's way is more efficient, with shorter workouts and longer time off, but the results soon plateau,(as with -any- method), and this way is really difficult to tough out during those times. Many trainees have had great strength improvement without the muscle they hoped for, and of course , Mike was on steroids when he looked good. Athletes will still have to spend tons of time on metabolic conditioning,(strength-endurance). So: It's not the best for building tissue, not the best for plateau jumping, not the best for athletes, and (although good for strength), not explosive, so not good for strength in competitive lifts. What is it good for? : A 'shot in the arm' for guys are screwed up from over-training,(Mentzer is the product of much volume before discovering this method). and guys without much time.

I firmly believe you need this even for curls etc, but with benches, squats...it's not a matter of opinion, because there are muscles used at one end of the movement that aren't used at the other end. Max contraction? Yeah, as long as you're ready to do a LOT of different exercises at every workout. The trouble is, -even then- you'll not have trained the movements: Your 'real' bench and squat will be lame.

What is promoted as science in society is often deception:  Research is  conducted by supposed scientific groups that are actually owned by the product's manufacturer. Government organisations named to sound like protection offices,(Department of Agriculture), are actually in place to promote business. Results are simply not released when the results don't go the 'right' way, so what the public sees as proof may be the one time out of ten that insures the \\"scientist's\\"  job security. Conclusions are often drawn that contradict the  obviously real conclusions, with the understanding that most of us won't wade through the technical jargon. My point is that \\"anecdotal evidence\\" , so maligned by the supposed scientists, is a whole different matter when it's YOUR anecdote. I'm witnesss to benign skin tumors dissolving,(for lack of a better word), on diets similar to the Grape Cure.  Yes, going too long would be a mistake, but a couple of weeks on fruits only, during the warmer months, is certainly less harmful than ANY alternative offered by the 'proven' methods of the medical community. If you want be a 'Quackwatcher', the first thing you need to 'watch' is the 'Quackwatchers' themselves, where hidden motives abound.	2004-05-07

HGH precursors and all similar products  have been proven useless, but Klatz has made his money, so no problem. Very short exercise sessions of high intensity will help your body create the proper 'mix' of hormones..... Go to your health club and find a weight on the leg press machine that you can do slow reps on for one minute. At the end of the one set, you should find it impossible to move the weight,(and feel horrible :-). Do a similar set of of seated chest press and seated row. YOU'RE DONE! You can do more if you want, according to what results you're going for, but a full effort on these three sets will  get your hormones going. Actually, the leg press -alone- will get everything going quite well. Say no to drugs.	2004-05-05

This is the point behind the original Nautilus and MedX machines:asymetrical pulleys,(cams), change the leverage advantage to keep the resistance appropriate throughout the exercise, allowing unchangingly slow  movement in the full range. (Also , the machine must be designed with very low friction, a costly production procedure, as friction can add unaccounted for and arbitrary resistance during slow movment.)  and; 2/Expert coaching,(ie \\"Superslow\\",tm). Properly executed slow training is SO  HARD that without someone monitoring your technique and effort, and giving you proper encouragement, you will -never- work as hard as this system demands for it's special results. Even with all of the proper equipment and help, slow training can be _very_ discouraging at plateaus, and is quite expensive. Very slow movement is an exaggeration to quarantee safe movement. you don't need to move all that slow. What you really need is:1/ Not 'throw' the weight, but rather 'squeeze' it, the speed within this quideline is your choice.. and: 2/ Once you've found a speed keep it consistant from week to week , to not get a false sense of progress, as speeding up can make heavier weight possible to lift,(that is NOT the goal!!!). On the whole , Hahn seems to trying to make this system into something that it is NOT; a home workout. But how many books can you sell by telling people that, properly done, this must be shortest, but HARDEST, work of your life? My question is: How many of the crucial details of the original concept,(Super SlowTM),  can you disregard, and yet still somehow have the valued results of the system?	2004-05-05

Deadlifting has been the subject of much agreement in the fitness world as the  most important barbell movement to enhance athletic performance. The varieties of and tricks for improving DL performance can be put on two pages. Overhead presses are treated as the pushing equivalent of the DL's pulling. SP's are rightfully more imporant than bench presses, or for that matter, perhaps any other single movement. Ok. Another two pages. Pavel makes it a whole forty dolllar book, and charges another forty for two more exercises in another book,(pushups and squats), in his -Naked Warrior-Pavel makes a big point of the superiority of building strength without mass due to the possibility of losing the mass, and thus the strength, in harsh circumstances. The -reality- is that strength built without mass must recieve constant training to be maintained, and is very specific to the way it's trained, while mass is much slower to be lost,(along with its strength), and is applicable to whatever strength you apply it to, with a little bit of training. Unless you are training for powerlifting, the possible damaging effect of the heavy weight eventually needed in this method far outweigh the benefits. (add 10.08/05): In Arthur Jones' \\"Nautilus Bulletin\\" #1, chapter 9, Jones essentially recommends the same program in Pavel's book,(overhead presses and deadlifts), with the addition of squats. This was originally published  in 1973, and  the individual ideas had been stated by Jones long before that.  The point is that: 1/this stuff isn't new, 2/the split between 'functional ' trainers and bodybuilders is  a modern creation with no meaning to clear thinkers such as Jones, and 3/ it's free!(on the internet).	2004-04-23

Klatz is known to have connections with manufacturers that he doesn't mention.

A little research of the  good doctor reveals business affiliations with at least some of the companies whose products he recommends. I consider this book a catalog.(As for the latest craze, 'homeopatic hgh', please realize what homeopathic formulas actually are:_incredibly_ weak dilutions. That's why it's legal. If you ascribe to the homeopatic philosophy,fine, but I find that most people don't know what they're getting into:The theoretically perfect homeopathic dilution would have _none-of the original ingrediant left in it, just the  'energy pattern' formed from it's having once been there.
