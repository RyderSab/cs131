In the bands that split away from the beaten forces, she ran for awhile with a pack that included a gifted gunslinger named Gwynn.<br /><br />They meet again by chance in the arid deserts of Copper Country, both lone wanderers fleeing from the great General Anforth and searching for a place to belong.  Together, they are able to make their way up onto the Teleute Shelf, to the city of Ashamoil.  A rich city built on terraces over a bustling river, surrounded by fecund jungles and swamp-like flats.  Ashamoil is a city of wonders, of deeply imbedded cultures, and magical affairs.<br /><br />Raule finds herself unable to obtain high employment, lacking the required social attachments to accredited colleges, and therefore takes up employment as a doctor in the seedy parish hospital in the Limewood district.  Gwynn, on the other hand, being a skilled assassin and resembling a Renaissance man, obtains a high position in the Society of the Horn Fan, a mafia-type organization which controls the slave trade.<br /><br />Raule disapproves of Gwynn's position, and turns her back on him.  Gwynn imbeds himself deeply into the Society, fitting to it like a sleek black glove on a long fingered hand.  By chance he meets a strange artist, Beth, with whom he strikes up a semblance of affection.  The days are high for Gwynn, and low for Raule, who entertains herself by collecting malformed and warped fetuses in jars.<br /><br />'The Etched City' is one of the greatest fantasies I have ever read.  Reminiscent of Mieville's 'Perdido Street Station', VanderMeer's 'City of Saints And Madmen', Gerard Daniel Houarner's 'Black Orchids From Aum', and Jeffrey Thomas's 'Punktown', K.J. Bishop has created a world so surrealistically beautiful and yet so sordidly vile that I can't wait for her to write another book of Ashamoil.<br /><br />Her characters are fully fleshed, even though some completely lack in any emotion, her use of prose is riveting and yet smooth, and her imagination vividly wonderful.  'The Etched City' is a dark fantasy, finding this treat was like finding a rich, overripe plum hanging heavy from a decaying branch, one that I could not resist plucking and biting into, to taste the heavy, sweetly fetid syrup it offered up to me.  Never knowing if the next bite would be sweet, sour, or putrid, I was unable to stop myself from finishing it's corrupt succulence.<br /><br />I would rate `Etched City' a ten star book, and I definitely recommend that you give it a read.  If I had one problem with it, it would be that I would have liked to see a little more of Raule, but Gwynn is obviously the more flamboyant of the two protagonists.

When did Janet Jackson's Superbowl display become more immoral than public lying?  Or lying to the public?  (The good book says, \\"Thou shalt not lie\\" but mentions nothing about nudity)<br /><br />Leave it to the intelligence and wit of John Skipp to bring up the \\"Dumb that dare not speak its name\\".  Skipp describes `Stupography' as \\"media that actually makes you dumber the longer you look at it\\", and boy, are we surrounded by this very thing more than ever today.<br /><br />Many people, like me, have completely tuned out their TV's because of this wave of 'Stupography', and have lost hope in the ability of the American people to overcome the mind-numbing placidity shoveled over us by media, politicians, and greedy corporations.  It's enough to make one give up on humans and look to the cockroach to next rule the world.<br /><br />But Skipp tackles these important issues without ever losing his sense of humor, his hope, his ambitions, or his integrity, which makes this one of the most refreshing books I have read to date.  Skipp's personality positively bursts from the pages, a friend you would want to have over to your home, to sit and talk and watch some silly movie with.<br /><br />From 'Prickly vs Gooey' philosophy, to an amazingly witty diatribe of the new TCM movie, to comparing D&D alignments to political parties, to spam emails that offer up enhancements you didn't know you needed, to \\"egregious violations of the soul in the name of oil and greed and power\\", to chaos and complacency, Skipp is absolutely unafraid to boldly step forward and stand by his opinions.  At times it may remind you of a Dennis Miller rant, without the cynicism and with more good-natured humor.<br /><br />'Stupography' is an amazingly enjoyable break from being too serious about your non-fiction, and yet doesn't use a light message to wake us all up to the truth.  Your day, and your life, is filled with Stupography.  Let Skipp show you how to thin the weeds out, so that you can enjoy life to its fullest without worrying about the Jones's next door or the bimbo on TV or that ad in your newspaper.  I highly recommend this book.  Enjoy!Stupography.

Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Viciously flavored morsels tasting of pain	Horrifying, electrifying, and downright squishy, this early collection of Jeffrey Thomas shows much more than budding talent, it shows that Thomas has been in full bloom since first taking up the pen.<br /><br />Thomas rapidly climbed to the status of one of my favorite authors with his Punktown series, and his recent novel Boneland has earned a special place in my black heart and on my bookshelf.  'Aaaiiieee!!!' will join the others in my 'favored' bookcase.<br /><br />There isn't one bad story in this collection, and too many excellent ones to cover in one review.  My favorite would have to be one of the squishiest and most disgusting tales I have ever enjoyed, 'Family Matters'.  And you thought your family was embarrassing!<br /><br />The incredible heartache of love that reaches beyond physical repulsion is graphically illustrated in 'John Sadness', the repugnant romp of incest in 'Dust', a tale of madmen in 'Mass Production', a gun's inner thoughts in 'Gun Metal Blue', a Freakshow of horror in 'The Sister', (an idea Thomas elaborates further in his novel 'Everybody Scream' which came out much later than this short story), and a touching story of life's unfinished business in 'The Red Spectacles', barely begins to skim the talent offered up in this anthology.<br /><br />As a final note, I discovered that the distinguished cover art is also credited to Jeffrey Thomas.  Not only can he write, but he can dream up and create a lovely alien face that tickles my cute-meter while still causing bile to rise.  Awesome job, Jeffrey!  I can't recommend Thomas's work highly enough!  Enjoy the book!	2005-10-02
US	52859935	R21VUA7H0W2QAY	0759243999	588172363	Pieces of Hate	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Shivering tidbits that are delightful to munch	Ray Garton takes horror and mixes in elements of humor and satirist commentary that cannot help but become tiny pieces of hate in a world filled with loathing.  'Pieces of Hate' is a great collection for any aficionado of horror, and a worthwhile addition to your own bloody collection.<br /><br />Beginning with the impossibly good 'A Gift From Above', a novella of two estranged sisters reuniting over the shadow of cancer, 'Pieces of Hate' offers up such treasures as 'Cat Hater', a tongue-in-cheek glimpse into the secret lives of cats, the satirical 'The Devil's Music', peeking into the afterlife of today's rock stars, to the poetic 'God's Work' where a pastor attempts to rein in his wayward congregation.<br /><br />Garton writes with precise prose, using shades of sin and immorality to highlight his tales.  He is unafraid to poke fun at talk show hosts and televangelists, using a skeletal claw to tickle their ribs and cause chunks of truth to spew from their deceitful mouths.<br /><br />I've just started reading Garton after stumbling across a short or two in some of my anthologies, and am pleased to say that his is a welcome addition to my shelves.  The combination of great talent, horror, humor, and satire is irresistible and compelling, and I look forward to reading more of his work.  Enjoy!	2005-10-02
US	52859935	R34WX8TKXT0TGP	9933610007	999309934	Splatterspunk	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Just plain ol' nasty and gross, very little plot	This is the first Edward Lee book I have ever given a low rank to.  Why?  Well, because it's rank.  I love squelchy and bloody horror, even with extensive perversions thrown in, but Splatterspunk is simply one long and drawn out diatribe of foul language and infected sex.  And I do mean infected.<br /><br />The story is loosely about PFC Micah Hays, a police officer in Luntville, and his chief Richard Kinion.  True, they wind out investigating some strange incidents involving werewolves and aliens and a demon running a sideshow; but what dominates the book is the long-winded rantings of Micah Hays about his deviant sexual conquests.<br /><br />Honestly, the tirade includes poop and pus and infections and \\"stanky girl-holes\\" and some of the grossest descriptions I have ever heard in my life.  I am no shrinking violet, and do not turn away from good horror just because of a few gross-outs; but when page after page after page is nothing but a tedious, rambling monologue with a piece of plot thrown in every 50 pages or so in-between, then it loses it's nauseating charm and evolves into nothing more than wasted time.<br /><br />On top of the wearisome soliloquy of filthy sexual odors and doings, the entire novel is written in \\"back-woods redneck\\" speak.  If you have read Lee's 'The Bighead', then you will know the broken-speech writing I am talking about.  While tolerable in 'The Bighead' because it was used to depict the internal workings of The Bighead's mind and allow us to see the way his inner thought process worked, in Splatterspunk it merely becomes annoying and excruciatingly boring.<br /><br />Save yourself a lot of money, since this book is out of print and expensive to come by, and pass on this novel, even if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of Edward Lee like I am.  Splatterspunk just isn't up to Lee's standards, and to me was a waste of good reading time.  I still gave it three stars for Lee's amazing writing talent, but the content in and of itself isn't actual three star material.  Purchase 'The Bighead' instead, and satisfy your backwoods Lee that way.e 'The Bighead' instead, and satisfy your backwoods Lee that way.	2005-10-02

Yes, and 'Keepers' proves it.  Gary Braunbeck has an extraordinary talent for taking you into parts of the mind that ebb and flow with surreal horror and unbearable charm, twisting emotion into intricately woven braids of thought, imagination, and lurid reality.<br /><br />'Keepers' is so much more than the blurb on the back cover, it has a haunting 'coming of age' tale so poignantly detailed that I forgot I was reading a horror book.  But nothing makes charm more vivid than the red-rimmed eyes of an unseen menace creeping up behind you.<br /><br />Gil Stewart is an ordinary man, running his own business of 'novelties and collectibles' stores, and caring for his institutionalized Down's Syndrome nephew, Carson, one week a month.  Until one day his normal life is shattered, first by witnessing a bizarre death on the highway, then by a mangy dog crawling under his house to die, and lastly a phone call from the institution telling him Carson is missing.<br /><br />It's time to Gil to remember his past, to piece together the fragments of his memories in order to discover the secret of the Keepers, and why the Magritte-Man killed on the highway warned him of them.  Gil must remember his parents, and the unbreakable bond he formed with Beth, his girl of the past, long missing and presumed dead.  He must remember his kindnesses, to animals and elderly and all those who are invisible to the rest of the world.  Before the Keepers come.<br /><br />Anyone who has read Braunbeck will not be surprised by the talent in his writing, but if this is your first Braunbeck book, then get ready for an emotional roller coaster that will leave you gasping for air and unable to put the book down until you are finished.  I can't recommend this book highly enough, definitely a 10-Star keeper.  Enjoy!	2005-09-29

Viehl's works will be happy to be returning to the planet K-2, and reacquainting themselves with the 'Zangians, the aquatic natives of K-2.  While 'StarDoc' introduced us to K-2, 'Bio Rescue' was Viehl's first book to focus on the 'Zangians.  'Afterburn' is much more than a continuation of 'Bio Rescue', it's a stand alone story that brings back old friends and introduces us to some new ones.<br /><br />Byorn mu Znora, 'Burn' to his friends, is the best gunner in the Bio Rescue fleet, training to become a pilot.  Burn is young, big, and often reckless, a perfect candidate to guard the Ylydii Ambassador and her daughter, Liana.  The Ylydii are also aquatics, arriving at K-2 along for a Peace Summit with the 'Zangians, the Skartesh, and the people of Ninra.<br /><br />As Peace Summits go, this one has more than its share of problems, each race with their own ideas of what type of deal to strike.  While the main plot revolves around the Summit, there are many intriguing subplots woven into the storyline, which Viehl will expertly tie together in the end.<br /><br />Returning are old friends Jadaira, Burn's cousin, and her mate Onkar, Administrator Ana Hansen and Dr. William Mayer, Major Shon Valtas from the Skartesh incident, Jadaira's 'Zangian father Dairatha and his human mate Dr. Teresa Selmar.<br /><br />I found myself particularly drawn to new character Emily Kim from Earth, who forms an unlikely alliance with Omorr pathologist Dr. Hkyrim.<br /><br />S.L. Viehl's ability to breathe life into this alien world and its alien life forms are what separates her work from the rest of the bunch and elevates it far above any genre restrictions.  She is able to tell a humanitarian story using characters who are fully fleshed out and genuine, and paints the world of K-2 with such vivid colors that I wish I could purchase a one-way ticket there.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, along with all of Viehl's other works.

When her mother died, she gave Jory an undertaking; to go to Joren and find the rest of the half-Jorenian children who were the results of the same 'raid-and-ravage' from which she was born.<br /><br />Including Jory, there are seven half-breeds.  Once Jory delivers her message to them, a message of truth, the others decide to join her in her quest.  Jory is off to learn how to become a Blade Dancer, the deadliest of assassins, in order to hunt down and kill the biological father that violated her mother so many years ago.<br /><br />The gang is trained on Reytalon in the Tana, to become Blade Dancers, but in the midst of the tests of strength and endurance, the seven must learn to trust each other also.  And even Reytalon is not immune to conspiracy and evil alliances with the warring League and Hsktskt factions.  Will what these seven learn at Reytalon be enough for them to avoid the same fate of their parents?<br /><br />S.L. Viehl is one of my favorite authors.  Definitely lighter than most of my other fare, Viehl is always able to bring in tense, taunt situations with realistic and likeable heroines, and create a story that I can literally pour myself into.<br /><br />Her worlds are extraordinary, her characters so real that I would know them on the street, her aliens imaginative and believable, and her plots thick with action and adventure.<br /><br />I was introduced to Jorens in Viehl's StarDoc books, and was intrigued to see a darker side of their clannish ways in Blade Dancer.  Viehl gave us a little peek at just how stubborn those big blue guys are.<br /><br />If you liked the 'StarDoc' series, you will love 'Blade Dancer'.  'Blade Dancer' is a good starter book to introduce yourself to Viehl's writing also, though I promise you will be running for more of her work when you finish.  Enjoy!	2005-09-28

China Mieville at last releases more pieces of his talent in this collection of fourteen stories.  Some have been previously released, and if you are a die-hard fan like myself you may already have them.<br /><br />'Reports of Certain Events In London' was in McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories, 'Entry From A Medical Encyclopedia' was published as 'Buscard's Murrain' in The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide To Eccentric And Discredited Diseases, and 'The Tain' is from Cities.<br /><br />'Looking For Jake' did leave me slightly disappointed in some areas, namely the political undertones of 'Tis The Season' (originally published in The Socialist Review) and 'An End To Hunger', neither of which contained any real fantasy or horror, and the oddly vapid 'On The Way To The Front', an amateurish graphic piece.<br /><br />There are, however, other stories in this collection that make the price worthwhile just for them.<br />'Familiar' is a gruesomely enchanting story of one male witch's creation run amok, 'Different Skies' takes a simple window replacement and shows us the kind of horror that can be reflected in oddness, and 'Foundation' will take you beneath the structures of everyday life and into a man's horrific ability to see the dead below them.<br /><br />'Jack' is a nice addition to Mieville's 'Perdido Street Station', giving us a bit of background on his character Jack Half-A-Prayer, and 'The Tain' is a twisted tale of mirrors and what lies beyond.<br /><br />If you are a rabid Mieville fan, you simply must have this book.  If you are introducing yourself to Mieville, I actually recommend starting with 'Perdido Street Station' to allow yourself to fully savor this talented writer's rich offerings.  Reading Mieville is like eating chocolate cheesecake, rich and satisfying and fulfilling.  Enjoy!	2005-09-28

His ability to nail the human character transcends the time frame of his works.<br /><br />In 1972, an \\"accident\\" occurred, due to a mistake by scientist Dr. Bruno Bluthgeld.  Bruno, aka \\"Mr. Tree\\", hasn't been able to live with himself since the accident, and seeks the help of psychiatrist Dr. Stockstill during the year 1981.  As he steps out from Stockstill's offices, the bombs begin to fall.<br /><br />Surviving the bombs are also Hoppy Harrington, an armless and legless thalidomide victim with telekinetic powers, Walter Dangerfield, who was sent up in a ship with his wife to travel to Mars but wound out eternally orbiting the earth instead, Stuart McConchie, a TV repairman, and Bonnie Keller, an unhappy housewife and former associate of Dr. Bluthgeld.<br /><br />They all find themselves in the same West Marin community, living an urban life with no electricity and traveling by wood-burning vehicles or horse.  Bonny has a child now, a strange girl with a twin brother inside of her.  Bluthgeld becomes more deranged, Walt becomes sick, Hoppy becomes a megalomaniac, and Bonnie's twin Bill awakens.<br /><br />Things get stranger and stranger in West Marin as the survivors struggle to stay alive, not only in the blighted world, but inside their newly emerged social structures.<br /><br />'Dr. Bloodmoney' is not the best of Philip Dick's works, but is a memorable tale to add to your collection.  Strangely compelling with odd, unpredictable characters, this book makes a very nice beach or vacation read.  Enjoy!	2005-09-16
US	52859935	R3AWZIAOWVFMOV	0312864744	356296858	Ports of Call	Books	3	0	1	N	Y	Pleasant Space Opera with strange worlds but weak protagonist	Myron Tany wants to travel in space, though his folks want him to finish his education and be respectable.  When Myron's great aunt Dame Hester LaJoie receives a slander settlement in the form of a beautiful space yacht, Myron sees his opportunity.<br /><br />Hester wishes to find the \\"Fountain of Youth\\" described in a magazine article, and decides to take her yacht for a trip.  After exposing Hester's 'male friend' as a fraud, Myron is allowed to captain the yacht.<br /><br />They set out on their journey, but Hester soon becomes bored and demands that they visit other spaceports for action.  Hester allows shady Marko Fassig to join them on their journey, and after a confrontation, Myron is dropped off at the spaceport of Port Tanjee and left behind.<br /><br />Myron then joins the crew of the 'Glicca', a space freighter, as a supercargo under Captain Maloof.  With shipmates Fay Schwatzendale and Wingo, a cargo bay filled with deliveries, and passengers from a strange religious sect, Myron sets out on his space adventures.<br /><br />'Ports Of Call' is the first book in Myron's adventures, followed by 'Lurulu', so the story will seem unfinished when you reach the end of the book.  However, my major complaint wasn't the abrupt ending but the exit of the most interesting character even before the halfway point; Dame Hester LaJoie.  Hester has the sauciness of Vance's usual characters, and Myron, in comparison, is weak, dull, and gullible.  Following Dame Hester's absence from the story, the most interesting character of Myron's new crew, Hilmar Krim, is quickly removed from the story also.<br /><br />Adding to the downside is a tendency of Vance's to be repetitive in certain details and phrases, and poor editing on the part of the publisher.  Again, like Vance's 'Night Lamp', 'Ports Of Call' is a good book to read if you are a fan of Jack Vance.  Otherwise, pick up 'The Demon Princes' first, for a better taste of Vance.  Enjoy!	2005-09-15

They called themselves The Demon Princes.  Kirth survives, along with his grandfather, who then raises the boy to become the ultimate revenge maker on the ruthless princes.  After the death of his grandfather, Kirth finishes his training and is ready to take on the five demon princes.  Volume Two covers the last two princes, Lens Larque (The Face) and Howard Alan Treesong (The Book Of Dreams).<br /><br />The Face has to be my favorite story of the five tales.  Gerson hears rumor of Lens Larque, and begins to suspect that Lens is Darsh, from the planet Dar Sai under the Coranne sun.  The Darsh are unattractive, heavy boned and often corpulent, and have a foul odor from the unpalatable food they prefer.<br /><br />Kirth begins his hunt on Aloysius, where he begins to suspect Lens is the owner of a worthless company called Kotzash.  Gerson begins to secretively purchase stocks of Kotzash, trying to gain controlling shares.  His interests soon take him to Dar Sai, a searingly hot planet where the Darsh live underneath huge umbrellas.  Here, he meets a girl from Dar Sai's neighboring planet, Methel.  The Methlen are a cliquish folk, arrogant and refined.  Kirth falls in love with Jeridan Chanseth, and follows her to Methel while still attempting to uncover Lens Larque.  The Face, spanning these three planets, is filled with gripping adventures, close calls, and an ending that will leave you rolling on the floor laughing your hinder off.<br /><br />The second tale in Volume Two is The Book Of Dreams, and Gerson's pursuit of Howard Alan Treesong.  Using trickery and ostentatious foppery, Gerson attempts to lure Treesong out of hiding by circulating a possible photo of Treesong in a contest through his magazine.<br /><br />Treesong is not only heartless and ruthless but completely insane, and proves to be quite slippery.  Gerson uses a pretty girl named Alice to establish communication with the elusive Treesong and bring him out of hiding.  Treesong has a strange illusion of several Paladins as part of his personality, and often speaks in different tones and styles.<br /><br />You will love the ending to The Book Of Dreams almost as much as The Face, where we meet Otho and Tuty Cleadhoe, an older couple with a personal vendetta against Treesong that rivals Gerson's motives.<br /><br />'The Demon Princes', both Volume One and Two, are the best of Jack Vance's works that I have read to date.  If you love vividly strange worlds as much as I do, then you can't go wrong with Vance.  SciFi with a touch of humor, and some of the most imaginative worlds and societies in writing, Vance books always seem to satisfy me.

Treesong has a strange illusion of several Paladins as part of his personality, and often speaks in different tones and styles. <br /> <br />You will love the ending to The Book Of Dreams almost as much as The Face, where we meet Otho and Tuty Cleadhoe, an older couple with a personal vendetta against Treesong that rivals Gerson's motives. <br /> <br />'The Demon Princes', both Volume One and Two, are the best of Jack Vance's works that I have read to date.  If you love vividly strange worlds as much as I do, then you can't go wrong with Vance.  SciFi with a touch of humor, and some of the most imaginative worlds and societies in writing, Vance books always seem to satisfy me.  Enjoy! <br />	2005-09-15

During an excursion to record native music on the planet of Camberwell, Hilyer and Althea Fath find a band of hooligans beating a small boy in the street.  They intervene and save the boy, taking him to the hospital.  The boy won't come out of his coma without tremendous stress, so the doctors erase his memory.  The only thing the boy was able to tell them is that his name is Jaro.<br /><br />The Faths adopt Jaro and take him to their homeworld of Thanet to raise him.  Thanet has a complex social structure, of which Hilyer and Althea refuse to participate in, making them \\"nimps\\".  If a person doesn't belong to a club, and continuously strive to reach a higher level club, they are ridiculed and unaccepted in Thanet's society.<br /><br />Jaro grows up, a \\"nimp\\" like his adopted parents.  In his class is Skirlet Hutsenreiter, a \\"Clam Muffin\\", one of the most elite clubs.  Skirlet has more problems than she lets the outside world know of, therefore she and Jaro strike a shaky friendship.  Jaro grows up wanting to be a spaceman, to find out the truth behind his strange past.  Hilyer and Althea want him to have an academic career at The Institute.<br /><br />Because 'Night Lamp' is a story of Jaro's maturing, I won't give away any other details of the story.  There are intricately imbedded subplots and schemes that add to the character of the tale.  Vance has a way of lulling you into the complacency of Jaro's life and then shocking you with a sudden turn of event.  His was of painting new worlds, species, and societies with intricate detail and interesting situations will keep you reading long into the night.<br /><br />However, about three quarters of the way through this book, the story falls apart.  It becomes more than a bit cheesy, uses repetitive dialogue, and IMHO makes a dumb turn that the story would have been better without.  Also annoying was mention of a particular package that piqued curiosity and was never revealed.<br /><br />All in all, you will definitely like 'Night Lamp' if you are a Jack Vance fan.  If not, start with 'The Demon Princes' and save 'Night Lamp' for later.  Enjoy!definitely like 'Night Lamp' if you are a Jack Vance fan.

They called themselves The Demon Princes.  Kirth survives, along with his grandfather, who then raises the boy to become the ultimate revenge maker on the ruthless princes.  After the death of his grandfather, Kirth finishes his training and is ready to take on the first of the five demon princes.<br /><br />The Star King, first of the five books, (or long chapters, if you will) is the story of Kirth's hunt for Malagate The Woe.  In a neutral, off-world tavern called Smade's, Gersen meets Lugo Teehalt, who tells him a fantastical story about a beautiful planet he has discovered.  Gersen learns that Attel Malagate is after Teehalt's monitor in order to find this world, so Gersen uses the monitor's filament as bait to lure Malagate out.  Shaking off assassins and bargaining with influential Institutes, Gersen brings about his encounter with Malagate, culminating on Teehalt's fantastical world.<br /><br />The second part, The Killing Machine, is about Gersen's hunt for Kokor Hekkus, better known as The Killing Machine.  From filthy out-worlds to the renowned institution called Interchange, Gerson is off on another chase.  Located far out on a desert planet, Interchange exists for the expedient and safe exchange of kidnaps, acting as liaison for hostage and monetary demands.  Freeing two innocent children and a contractor for Hekkus, Gersen finds more than he was looking for when he himself is kidnapped and held for ransom at Interchange.  Guessing at a connection between Hekkus and a beautiful woman held for a phenomenal amount of money, Gersen finds himself on the mystical planet of Tamber and smack in the middle of a confrontation with The Killing Machine.<br /><br />In the third part, Gerson takes on demon prince Viole Falushe at Falushe's Palace Of Love.  Getting to the Palace isn't easy.  Gersen begins with a visit to the planet Sarkovy, a dismal place famous for its many poisons.  Then he flies to earth, to take up with a crotchety old poet named Navarth and his young daughter Zan-Zu.  When Navarth discovers that Gersen intends to exact revenge on Viole Falushe, the man who ruined Navarth's young lover, the old poet joins the assassin on a trip to Falushe's Palace Of Love, where Gersen must first identify Falushe before he can eliminate him.<br /><br />While all three tales contain a bit of mystery over who the real identity of the villain is, the majority of their intrigue and charm come from Vance's imaginative worlds; worlds complete with custom, foods, dress, environment, law (or lack of), flora and fauna, even planetary statistics.  There are twenty-six planets in the 'Concourse' around the sun Rigel, and many more in the 'Beyond'.  Vance creates a galaxy of rich and interesting places, peoples, and things.<br /><br />Truly a delight for the SciFi fan, with enough adventure for some tight situations and narrow escapes, plus a bit of detective intrigue (though our 'detective' is an assassin), 'The Demon Princes' is a science fiction romp that should satisfy most palates.  Don't forget to pick up volume two at the same time, or you will be left adrift between Gersen's meticulous pursuit of the five men who destroyed his world long ago.

Me included.  On patrol in Husaybah, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, Kilo Company Marines were patrolling, securing the area after an attack on a Marine convoy.<br /><br />At a vehicle check, an Iraqi insurgent burst from his vehicle with a loaded grenade, attacking Corporal Jason Dunham and his squad.  Corporal Dunham was mortally wounded in the attack while saving the lives of the Marines who fought the insurgent with him.  One of the Marines he saved is a young man I have known for fifteen years, who I watched grow up.<br /><br />Everybody should read this book.  It brings the daily lives and duties of our brave Marines to blinding light, and will show you from an insider's view how ALL of these husbands, sons, and fathers are heroes, every day there are out there.  Jason's heroism and tragedy is real, not just a sound-bite on your evening news.<br /><br />Michael M. Phillips has meticulously detailed this event, using painstaking second-by-second accounts of the convoy, the attack, and the vehicle check.  He diligently follows Jason's route home, from medical corpsmen to medevac, hospital to hospital, until he reaches American soil at last.  There are some gruesome accounts of the Marine's injuries and the surgeries that followed, so be prepared.<br /><br />This book is not for the squeamish, but war isn't pretty.  Combat is not our men and women wearing their dress blues; combat is our men and women wounded, bleeding, and dying.  Michaels details the military medical community, and the dedication these men and women have to the combat soldiers they care for.<br /><br />Anyone who follows my reviews will see that I am a horror aficionado.  'The Gift Of Valor' is the most horrifying book I have ever read, because it is real, because it hits straight to the heart.  I cried all through the book and I'm crying as I write this review.<br /><br />I say it again: Everybody should read this book.  Everyone should know what its like for the men and women we rely on everyday; everyone should feel the pain of losing Jason.<br /><br />To all my marines at Twenty-nine Palms, to my 'special son' Lance Corporal William Hampton, to PFC Kelly Miller, to each and every one of you who came to my house for a weekend of relaxation...know this:  \\"Mom\\" loves you!rely on everyday; everyone should feel the pain of losing Jason.

Martin's better works, 'The Armageddon Rag' still holds it charms for those of us who remember the era it was written in; and written for.  'Rag' was written in the eighties, with a trip down memory lane to the late sixties and early seventies, the birth of heavy rock and the 'freedom era'.<br /><br />Sandy Blair is a writer, working hard on his latest novel that just seems to go nowhere, when he gets a call from his old magazine The Hedgehog to do a piece on the murder of Jamie Lynch, one time manager to the late, great rock band, the Nazgul.  The Nazgul were the biggest band of a lost era, until the lead singer, Patrick Henry Hobbins was shot to death at one of their concerts.<br /><br />Sandy accepts, and takes off on a road trip that leads him down a darkened memory lane.  He finds himself pulled further and further into his past, seeing old friends and remembering old ideals.  He's pulled so far in, in fact, that he looses his byline with The Hedgehog, his novel, his agent, his girlfriend, his house, and begins to question his sanity.  Strange things are happening to the old band members of Nazgul, tragic things that are slowly leading the band back together.<br /><br />Enter Eden Morse, who wants The Nazgul to reunite.  Eden has found a replacement for Hobbins, going so far as to finance plastic surgery for the young, new singer.  Eden wants Sandy to join them, to become part of the movement again, to use his words as he did in the past to promote The Nazgul.<br /><br />Sandy finds himself in a nightmare when Larry Richmond, the new singer Eden insists on calling 'Pat', begins to change.  Are there forces at work under the darkness of The Nazgul's reunion?<br /><br />The most interesting part of 'The Armageddon Rag' is how Martin weaved together two loves of mine, Tolkien references and hard rock.  As usual, his characters are fully fleshed and breathe life under his words.  The downside is that the book tended to ramble in places, and the ending felt very flat compared to the suspense being built throughout the rest of the story.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a fan of Martin, you should read 'The Armageddon Rag'.  I found I enjoyed it more the first time I read it back in the eighties, but it still holds enough flavor to taste a second time.

Everything happens at an incredible pace, I felt like I had run a marathon when I was finished.<br /><br />Dr. Ben Anderson is working for the Sanker Corporation as a scientist.  His adopted daughter Haley Walthers worked with him, but was fired from Sanker after being accused of stealing other scientist's work.  Sanker Corp is located in the beautiful Friday Harbor on San Juan Island in Puget Sound.  During a routine dive to check on Glaucus, a very special octopus, Ben is attacked and nearly killed.  The pace is set.<br /><br />Ben tries to send Haley a warning as he attempts to flee his attackers, and save his research data from the wrong hands.  Sanker Corp, owned by Henry Gardner Sanker, has its own security force headed by the psychopathic Officer Frick.  Ben has never trusted Frick and knows him to be behind his attack.  All he needs to know now is why, and how to stay alive.<br /><br />Ben's nephew Sam Wintripp is used to shady dealings, recuperating from almost fatal wounds in the San Juan's that he received in the line of duty.  Sam bumps into Haley at the same time he notices strangers on the island.  Haley receives Ben's garbled call and heads off to Sanker to check on him.  What she finds at Sanker is an irate Officer Frick who locks her in a closet.  Sam worries when Haley doesn't return his call, and sets out for Sanker himself, to check on her.<br /><br />Hang onto your seats, ladies and gentlemen, you are barely into the second chapter, and all h*ll has broken loose.  The action-filled story takes place in a twenty-four hour time span, and will leave you utterly breathless.  Ben is running for his life and trying to save the information he has uncovered; secrets that not only unlock the possibility of harvesting the deep methane layer under the ocean for fuel, but of a project he calls ARCS that could lengthen man's lifespan by decades.<br /><br />One of the people who desperately want Ben's secrets is Frick.  Dun has painted the perfect antagonist with Frick, ruthless, deadly, cold and emotionless; Frick will let nothing stand between him and his prize.  With Ben having slipped through his fingers, Frick relentlessly pursues Haley and Sam in a tension loaded chase from island to island, by land and sea and air.  There isn't a word wasted or a moment to spare in this intense action thriller.<br /><br />'Black Silent' is my first David Dun book, but you can rest assured that I'll be picking up more of his novels.  I'm looking forward to seeing Sam Wintripp in Dun's other works.  I like Dun's style and pace setting, and was able to relate to his fully fleshed-out characters.  In 'Black Silent', I enjoyed his knowledge of boating and of scuba, and having lived near the San Juans, my reading enjoyment was tremendously increased by his familiarity with the area.<br /><br />'Black Silent' is a book I definitely recommend; just make sure you have time for it as a meal and not a snack.

It had me holding my breath even the second time around.<br /><br />Jack and Jo Phillips are on vacation in Mexico, kicking back and visiting the sites of ancient ruins.  They meet up with Stephen Potter, a man who seems quite familiar with the Mayan culture.  The three travel to Chichen-Itza and run into Jack's old buddy, Gus Wise, an archeologist on a dig in Coba.  Gus tells an intriguing tale of his dig, and explains why he can't meet them in Merida.  Instead, Stephen Potter travels to Merida with Jack and Jo.<br /><br />In Merida, Jack runs out for coffee and discovers that Stephen Potter is on the front pages of the newspapers as a wanted drug smuggler.  Racing back to the hotel, he finds Stephen dead and his wife missing.  Jack is taken to the police station and interrogated, but before he can be locked up there is an attempt on his life and a rescue by a stranger.<br /><br />The stranger turns out to be Travis Horn, who says he wants to help Jack, but has mysteriously picked up Potter's red duffle bag.  Jack knows he's in trouble, and knows that there is no one he can trust.  Slipping through the fingers of both the law and Horn, he makes his way to Gus's dig site in Coba.  It seems Gus is missing also, so Jack takes up with Hector Flores, the archeologist left in charge of the dig.  Hector is the only one that Jack now trusts, and he is torn between attempting to flee Mexico and finding his still missing wife.<br /><br />The action shifts from the tropics of Mexico to the political boardrooms of Washington DC's State Department and FBI offices.  Here we meet Nelson Carlton, an alcoholic has-been waiting for retirement who has been assigned to investigate 'Operation Raven', a hush-hush project under the direction of Senator J.J. Hightower, an influential man about to be named a Vice Presidential nominee.  Two men under Hightower have already mysteriously died, and a foiled attempt on Hightower's life has left the Senator in a highly public position.<br /><br />Carlton is aware that he was chosen for this assignment as a scapegoat, and swears to discover the truth behind 'Operation Raven'.  He senses a connection between the covert agents abandoned in the Yucatan and the assassinations in WA DC, but knows that he won't be taken seriously.<br /><br />Jack's trials are far from over; he is still being hunted by the Mexican authorities and by the mysterious Travis Horn.  Carlton's worries have just begun when the rat he uncovers begins to stink.  The duel intrigue of a single battle being fought by very different men under very different circumstances lends itself to a story that moves so fast it is very difficult to put down.<br /><br />'A Tourist In The Yucatan' is one of my favorite books.  Brumfield writes of the Mayan culture and jungles with such descriptive precision that I could feel the humidity and smell the dirt and greenery.  A subterranean scene left me as breathless as if I were exploring the dark passages myself.<br /><br />There are unpredictable twists and turns, very humanized characters (some likeable and some not), a plot that never slows down, and a background of both green and concrete jungles.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  Even the second time around, I was still holding my breath for the climax.

Tired of all those vampire novels where Mr. Vampire strolls about being sexy and seductive, beguiling all the little goth girls into giving up a little blood?  Well, Skipp and Specter have written a vampire tale that you can really sink your teeth into.  The pace of the book takes off like a bullet and keeps you reading long into the night.<br /><br />Deep in the bowels of the New York subway, a monster is lurking.  When Rudy Pasko, a nasty individual himself, meets up with the beast, he is unceremoniously invited into the beast's realm.  But for someone as nasty as Rudy, this is a gift and not a curse.<br /><br />Rudy's friend Stephen goes searching for him, meeting up with Joseph Hunter outside one of the tunnel entrances where a greenly rotting woman disintegrates.  Hunter is convinced that the recent subway killings are not your normal psychopath, and he enlists the help of Stephen and his friends Allan, Ian, and Rudy's ex-girlfriend Josalyn to take up the hunt with him.<br /><br />What follows is a wild ride through the tunnels, filled with fast-paced action and not a little gore.  The backdrop of the subterranean tunnels adds an edge of quiet horror to this graphic tale, the characters are very real and fleshed out, complete with their own problems and quirks.  The added insight from Rudy himself makes the terror even more palpable.<br /><br />Though written in the 80's (and it shows, no cell phones just beepers and other archaic devices, older trends and fashions) 'Light At The End' is still riveting, a timeless tale of real vampirism and beasts that really did pave the way for other known talents to let down their hair and let out their viscera.  Gory and fun, don't miss out on Light At The End, if you can find a copy!  Enjoy!	2005-08-09

Gathering up such talented writers as Gerard Houarner, John Pelan, Edward Lee, Charlee Jacob, and Mark McLaughlin, The Last Continent takes us on a journey through the last continent of Zothique that was originally created by Smith.<br /><br />You will feel the weak red sun as it dies, taste the dust of deserts on your lips, and tremble in the wake of strange magics.  The Last Continent crosses the fantasy/SciFi/horror genres like a savage bee pollinating blood-tinged flowers, and the memory of these tales will sting you in pleasing and painful ways, perhaps even hang around awhile like a lump of swollen, poisoned flesh.<br /><br />Here are the stories you will discover in The Last Continent.<br /><br />1 - To Wake The Dead In Nypholos by Gerard Houarner.<br /><br />A strange woman with mystic abilities visits the city of Nypholos, charming her way past the city's guardian.  But when her charms are diverted from him to the Xipe Uthala, the guardian proves he is true to his city over all others.<br /><br />2 - The Decibel Circus by Rhys Hughes.<br /><br />The last acolyte to the demon god Drigg journeys to a cold desert where stylites pose on pillars and speak in tongues that can arouse changes in men and earth.  Ximbus must use these stylites to bring his god back to life before his own body fades from disease.<br /><br />3 - The Benevolent Emperor by Brian McNaughton.<br /><br />An arrogant emperor discovers the consequences of arousing the wrath of the Gods, and must watch his kingdom die.<br /><br />4 - Where The Past Lay Buried by David B. Silva.<br /><br />When a man sets out on a journey to discover his beginnings, aroused by a prophetic vision, he discovers more than he bargained for and unleashes an unholy force on an innocent village.<br /><br />5 - The Temple Of Captured Gods by David Niall Wilson.<br /><br />Even a Priestess can be mistaken, and when coveting a contained God, even a King must listen first to his heart.<br /><br />6 - The Connoisseur Of Corpses by Dan Clore.<br /><br />A fantastic tale of a necrophiliac who gives his all to his God in order to become more involved with the dead, a deal that causes him to prosper in more ways than one.<br /><br />7 - The Vainglorious Simulacrum Of Mungha Sorcyllamia by Mark McLaughlin.<br /><br />Mark McLaughlin is one of my absolute favorite short story writers.  He always manages to bring in a glimpse of humor to both his titles and his tales.  In this tale, a gifted man becomes enamored by a painting made in his class, painted by a traveling girl with secrets to hide from him.  Nevertheless, they fall in love, and Mungha eventually winds out using all of his gifts in order to see this sensual beauty once more.<br /><br />8 - The Scarlet Succubus by Edward Lee and John Pelan.<br /><br />Two of the most talented horror writers come together for this oddly surreal tale.  One of the best in the collection.  A vile King with dissatisfied vassals pushes them over the edge with his decedent indulgences.  While Taquin Narr, the king's wizard, has the answer to uproot the vile king, he remains unaware of the King's secrets, passed on from generation to generation, secrets that keep the kingdom safe.<br /><br />Spectacular achievement in scifi/fantasy/horror cross-genre.<br /><br />9 - Hode Of The High Place by Jessica Amanda Salmonson.<br /><br />A simple boy manages to infiltrate the strange, spiraled palace raised up on an impossible plateau in the midst of an ignorant, rural town.  But in ignorance he rules his high place like a barbarian, and forgets from whence he came.<br /><br />10 - Serenade At The End Of Time by Don Webb.<br /><br />A thief or an acolyte, what will Fulbra be?  Where will his desires lead him, and at what price will he be distracted?<br /><br />11 - Blue Roses, Red Red Wine by t. Winter Damon.<br /><br />One of my favorites.  Cirdaith,strangely bound by magic to his harp called Shadowdreamer, sails off with his companions to find the City Of Blue Roses.  Though they arrive in caution, they stay in decadence, indulging their physical and spiritual fantasies with the mysterious and irresistible nymphs they find there.  Blood will flow and hearts will be broken, but the city will live forever with its hunger.<br /><br />12 - A Traveler In Desert Lands by Gene Wolf.<br /><br />Another favorite.  The price of a jug of water in a desert wasteland turns into a lifelong prison of madness.<br /><br />13 - Jolerarymi's Rose by Geoff Cooper.<br /><br />Love knows no bounds, but can love also see through all treacheries?  Stonecarver Jolerarymi wants only enough business to eek out a living and please his girl Sheleen.

Sheleen takes Jolerarymi's corpse to a Necromancer to reanimate.  But did she do it for Jolerarymi?  Or for herself?

Komtai discovers a fortune in jewels hidden within the crags of the mountains, and leaves poor Lyrkatra to become a great and wealthy king.  Years later, when Lyrkatra is brought before the king to entertain him, she is able to show Komtai that creation is the most powerful magic of all.<br /><br />18 - The Light Of Achernar by Brian Stableford.<br /><br />Wow.  This is the first story I have read by Brian Stableford, and he has earned a healthy round of applause from me.  One of the longer and more stylistic stories in this collection, The Light Of Achernar is a real treat.<br /><br />`Light' is a complex story surrounding the astrologer/sorcerer Giraiazal, who was exiled to the Isle of Cyntrom.  Here, he performs his predictions and declarations of fate for two merchant princes, who are in reality brutal pirates.  At the prince's request, Giraiazal tracks down the heirs to the palace throne, two young men whom the prince's are confident they can control.<br /><br />Lysariel, as the oldest, becomes king, and his brother Manazzoryn comes to live in the palace with him.  The brothers each marry a daughter of the pirates.<br /><br />But Giraiazal sees only misfortune in his readings of the stars, the fell star of Achernar holding its foul sway over the futures of the new royals.  Giraiazal does what he can to prevent his predictions from taking place as this complex tale of magic, love, and fate unfolds.  But Fate is a tempestuous mistress.<br /><br />19 - The Triumph Of The Worm by Karl Henrik Johnsson.<br /><br />This last story left me feeling as though the collection had suddenly flattened out, dropping away from its consistent splendor.  One of the most irritating things about this last story is that it, outside of the others, was very poorly edited.  Life was constantly misspelled as Fife, many times.  And the author took Smith's flowing style and turned it into a chaotic and discordant mess.  Each and every sentence was so long and drawn out that the prose lost its music.<br /><br />In `Worm', Zothique finally dies, leaving only a long-dead and decomposing madman to witness the sun's last throes.<br /><br />The Last Continent is an original reading experience, utilizing not only Smith's vision of Zothique but his stylistic, flowing prose.  These authors, like Smith, were able to breathe life into this dying world.<br /><br />The book has a nice introduction, \\"Grim News From The Far Future\\", by Donald Sidney-Fryer, beautiful cover art by Rob Alexander, and intriguing sketches within the pages by Fredrik King.  It is a limited edition of 500 copies, numbered and signed by each author.  The layout is very nice, a friendly format, with an easy to read font and tight binding.<br /><br />While the price is a bit formidable, I have hopes that this book will be picked up by another publisher and made available to the general public at an affordable price.  In the meantime, if you are into rare collectibles that have actual, enjoyable content, do not miss out on The Last Continent.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Written in easy, non-condescending language, Keys To Great Writing is a great interactive study tool for both the novice and the accomplished writer.<br /><br />Effective for all types of writing, Keys focuses on business writing as well as fictional (or literary) writing.  However, with its concentration on structure (in easy to use terms), Keys proves to be as valuable for writing a memo to your boss as it is for writing the great American novel.<br /><br />Relying heavily on Strunk and White's 'The Elements Of Style' and Williams' 'Style: Ten Lessons In Clarity', Wilbers captures a cozier approach to the structure and disciplines of writing well.  He also manages to cover an amazing array of rules, styles, and techniques, quite well, in a brief 250 pages.  The book also includes a Glossary of Grammatical Terms, a checklist for Keys To Great Writing, a checklist for Elements of Composition, a checklist for Proofreading, Recommended Resources, and an Index.<br /><br />Some of the book, especially chapter five on Personality, works well for public speaking as well as writing techniques.  So his points made in Keys To Great Writing could very well be called Keys To Great Communication.  One of the things I found most helpful was Wilber's heavy use of example, showing both the correct and incorrect structures.  Noun modifiers, actions verbs, hedges, POV's, setting, scene, subject, style, noun stacks, personality, adjectives, sentence types, ellipses, economy, punctuation, and more...its all here.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts, Keys To Great Writing, Elements Of Composition, and Drafting And Revising.  Each part is divided into straightforward categories that flow easily from one lesson to the next.  I wouldn't mind having Wilber's work on CD as a companion to the book.  If you write for business (memos, letters, policy and procedure), or you write for pleasure (poetry, fiction, non-fiction, short stories or novels), Wilber's 'Keys To Great Writing' is an invaluable companion for your desktop.

Is it time for something lighter, perhaps a little bit titillating?  Don't be afraid to pick up a little piece of modern erotica and settle in for warm evening.  You may even find yourself dragging the husband out of the garage or yard for a little playtime.<br /><br />Major Lara McDaniel is a no-nonsense officer in the Imperial Army of the United Galaxies, assigned as personal guard to the Emperor of Emeraldia.  Lara was raised as an orphan in the military, she knows no other way of life.  When Empress Lisandra, Emperor Thomellt's wife sends him a delivery of fresh protein, the Emperor is so greedy that he doesn't allow Lara to properly inspect the delivery, and the entire ship comes down with food poisoning.<br /><br />All except Lara, who was too tired to participate in the gluttony and chose sleep instead.  Awakened from too little sleep, Lara rushes to her comrade's call only to witness the Emperor being kidnapped.  She sets out in a light speeder, tracing the ion trail of the fleeing ship in pursuit, when she is fired upon.<br /><br />Enter Riley, piloting a scavenger ship, who happens upon the space debris and pillages it, only to discover that Lara is still alive.  Lara awakens all business, and commandeers Riley's ship to track down the kidnappers.  Between Riley and Lara, they put two and two together to figure out who the kidnappers are, now all they need is a rescue plan.<br /><br />What follows is a steamy space romp, with very explicit scenes, as Lara and Riley follow the kidnappers trail while not engaging in time-passing activities.<br /><br />Rebel's Lust will never win any literary awards, or even grammatical awards, but I found it to be a pleasant diversion from the horror I normally read, and the intensity of what some refer to as \\"better works\\".  Sometimes you just have to take a break and have some fun.<br /><br />I would never normally pick up this genre, but being a sci-fi fan, a friend of mine recommended it to me, and I found it rather enjoyable.  It is not long, and won't take more than a couple of hours to read, but I found it both relaxing and stimulating.  Don't judge a book by its cover, especially this one.  The cover is horrible and does not portray the fun inside the book.  Enjoy!<br /><br />** Note:  I actually meant to give this book 4 stars, but slipped and submitted it as 5 stars.

The layout of the book is favorable to the subject, starting with Beginnings, followed with Middles, and finishing with Endings, though each segment blends well into the lessons of the others.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for non-college level beginners, or those who need to refresh their ancient college studies with some new blood.  This book tends to be helpful no matter what level you are on, making it a must-have in any writer's collection.<br /><br />Well written, non-condescending, helpful for those who already have an inkling of what they are doing, and a particularly good piece if you are stuck on your \\"middles\\", I highly recommend buying a copy of Beginnings, Middles, & Ends if you intend to write for any length of time.

Originally a collection of shorts published in Analog magazine as a continuing saga, Tuf Voyaging is all the pieces put together into a smooth novel with an extremely unique protagonist.<br /><br />Haviland Tuf and his ship, the 'Cornucopia Of Excellent Goods At Low Prices', has been hired by a group of five people to travel towards what is known as The Plague Star.  When upon arriving, they discover it is not a star at all but a long abandoned Seedship, left over from the war a thousand years ago.  Their first problem is getting past the ship's automated defenses and boarding, their second problem is the greed that has filled every head except Tuf's.<br /><br />Tuf, of course, winds out in charge of the Seedship, named the Ark.  (no details, just read the book!  The first chapter details these events, and is most excellent!)  the remaining six chapters chronicle Tuf's voyages from planet to planet, using the Ark to solve problems such as overpopulation, sea monsters, cruel animal-fighting pits, and religious plagues.<br /><br />Eccentric and droll would be the best way to describe Haviland Tuf, a very tall and very large bald man.  He travels alone, except for his cats, Havoc and Mushroom.  The cat family expands, and Tuf is inspired by his human encounters to name the new kittens Suspicion, Doubt, Hostility, Ingratitude, and Foolishness.  Tuf is a loner, intelligent, peculiar, a vegetarian with an enormous appetite, and a dry wit.  Indeed.<br /><br />The Seedship is a marvelous invention of Martin's, thirty kilometers long and three kilometers high, the pinnacle of the old Earth Ecological Corps inventions.  Although the EEC used their Seedships for war, Tuf has only benign uses for it.  Inside the Ark are stored millions and millions of cell samples, and all the equipment, including a chronowarp engine, to genetically engineer or clone any species.<br /><br />Travel with Tuf through space, and revisit the planet S'uthlam (three chapters have S'uthlam) where Tully Mune is the acerbic Portmaster who lives her life in zero gravity.  Tully's will and determination prove to be a match for Tuf, and the chapters in which they face off with each other are excellent.<br /><br />This is SciFi at it's best, very character oriented with enough strange planets, strange beings, strange traditions, and technology to satisfy the hungriest of SciFi palates.  Even more enjoyable if you are a cat lover like myself.  Get out and buy this book now!  Enjoy!here Tully Mune is the acerbic Portmaster who lives her life in zero gravity.

It did not disappoint.<br /><br />Bully is the true tale of a group of middle class kids who live in Hollywood Florida.  They decide that one of their peers, Bobby Kent, has pushed them around long enough.  Bobby Kent and Marty Puccio were best friends since grade school, even though Bobby beat Marty up quite frequently.<br /><br />One day, while working at the deli in the Publix market, the boys meet Lisa Connelly and Ali Willis.  Lisa can hardly believe it when the boys ask them to meet up at North Beach with them for some surfing.  As Lisa stares at Marty, she sees the hunks that adorn her adolescent room's walls, pictures of gorgeous and desirable men.  Lisa is homely and plump, and until now has only dreamed of having a boyfriend like Marty.<br /><br />For Ali, a very pretty, messed up, and spoiled girl, the meeting was just a quick fling with Bobby Kent.  She didn't like him very well.  Lisa continues to date Marty, though both Marty and Bobby physically and verbally abuse her, calling her Fatty and Shamu.  When Lisa discovers she is pregnant, she gets her cousin Derek Dzvirko to drive her to Marty's house.  Marty slaps Lisa around and mild mannered Derek intervenes, taking Lisa away.  Lisa becomes convinced that Marty would treat her differently if Bobby were out of the picture.<br /><br />And so begins the plotting, Lisa first convincing Marty, then bringing in Ali and her friends, Donny and Heather. After one foiled attempt at Bobby, the kids decide they need someone to help, so they enlist a friend of a friend who told them he was a Mafia hitman.  Derek Kaufman still lived with his parents on the fringes of Weston, and though he had trouble with the law, was not a hitman or even in a street gang.  Nonetheless, he convinces the kids that he's the real deal, and they take him in with them on their plan to kill Bobby Kent.<br /><br />Jim Schutze does an excellent job of really bringing out the kid's personalities and quirks of character.  The story reads like fiction, and I found myself having to remember that all of this was real, that these were events that really took place.  Of course, as a caution, I am going to tell you that included in the pictures is a very grisly photo of the murder scene with the body still present.  That brings the story back into focus pretty darn quick.<br /><br />It's quite scary to realize that these were not gang kids or ghetto kids, they were mall-rats and surfers and pretty little girls.  Some had been in minor scrapes with the law, most of them used drugs, and one had been involved in a teenage prostitution ring, but there were still kids you wouldn't expect to murder someone.<br /><br />Even scarier is the way these kids convinced themselves that they did nothing wrong, not to mention the parent's complete lack of acknowledgement that their own little child could have been involved in something so horrid.<br /><br />I highly recommend both the book and the movie, though with the book you will get more insight and much more courtroom information.  The book is well written, the movie well cast and following the book closely on the key elements.  Although I saw the movie first and then read the book, if you enjoy one you should enjoy the other, no matter the order in which you taste them.

Dick's better collections of short stories	The Minority Report is volume four of the collected shorts of the late, and very great, Phillip K. Dick.  This collection spans his writing period between 1954 and 1964, but you may be surprised at how up to date the feel of Dick's fiction is.  In spite of their age, these stories have maintained a freshness that can only be found with excellent human characterizations nestled inside technical sci-fi.<br /><br />Along with the short, The Minority Report, which the 2002 Spielberg movie starring Tom Cruise was based upon, there are many other strange treats in store for your science fiction palate.  Here are a few of my favorites:<br /><br />Autofac, where a post-war network insists on running the world for the good of the citizens.  The Mold Of Yancy, a lovely yarn about a seemingly harmless autocrat on an outer colony.  The Unreconstructed M, where murder comes in small, shifty boxes.  Explorers We, a never-ending cycle of hopes dashed.  War Game, the harmless, or not so harmless, tactics of market domination.  What The Dead Men Say, exploring a world where half-life after death is expected.  Oh, To Be A Blobel digests the aftereffects of infiltrating the enemy's forces by changing appearances.  And my favorite, The Days Of Perky Pat, where survivors of the last great war fight their battles with dollhouses.<br /><br />I believe that this is one of Dick's better collections, so if you are hankering for some good, old-fashioned sci-fi that will let you kick back into the future, pick up The Minority report, and Enjoy!<br /><br />TOC:<br /><br />AutoFac<br /><br />Service Call<br /><br />Captive Market<br /><br />The Mold Of Yancy<br /><br />The Minority Report<br /><br />Recall Mechanism<br /><br />The Unreconstructed M<br /><br />Explorers We<br /><br />War Game<br /><br />If There Were No Benny Cemoli<br /><br />Novelty Act<br /><br />WaterSpider<br /><br />What The Dead Men Say<br /><br />Orpheus With Clay Feet<br /><br />The Days Of Perky Pat<br /><br />Stand-By<br /><br />What'll We Do With Ragland Park?<br /><br />Oh, To Be A Blobel<br /><br />Enjoy the book!br />Enjoy the book! <br />	2005-06-18

Michael Chabon has gathered together some of the best writers of the era, and presents them to us as tidbits in this delectable collection.<br /><br />In most of these tales, you will find the lick of the macabre, a scent of titillating sci-fi, and a squeeze of horror that make for the best of short literature.<br /><br />China Mieville's 'Reports Of Certain Events In London' is a fantastic tale of rogue streets (yes, streets!) that roam the cities of the world.  Joyce Carol Oates 'The Fabled Lighthouse Of Vina Del Mar' (my favorite) is a sultry, frightening tale of isolation, madness, and strange quivering sea life.  Margaret Atwood delves into the bestial heredity of an otherwise sweet little girl in 'Lusus Naturae'.<br /><br />A mysterious doorway taunts the edge of your vision in 'Zeroville' by Steve Erickson.  A horrid foretelling of events spurs a man to try and change the future in '7C' by Jason Roberts.  Meet a bartender with a gift in Daniel Handler's 'Delmonico'.  Live with a household specter in 'The Devil Of Delery Street' by Poppy Z. Brite, and reminisce while deteriorating in Peter Straub's 'Mr. Aickman's Air Rifle'.<br /><br />Probably one of the more prominent attractions to this book is Stephen King's new short, 'Lisey And The Madman', but while giving adequate characterization, the story fell short by being a little too long-winded, a trait of King in his later works.  At any rate, with famous names like these, you know you are getting a superb treat.  'Astonishing Stories' is just that, lip smacking fun for anthology lovers.  Enjoy!	2005-06-15

In his DVD, Morgan took us on a journey with him as he proved that fast food is not, in any way, shape or form, nutritious.  Regardless of how fast food may flaunt nutritive additives, a meal it does not make.<br /><br />I am extremely pleased to have read, and be able to recommend, this book.  There are many sources out there for those of us who have already been aware of the horribly detrimental effects fast food is having on our health, but Morgan has captured the attention of the people, and now brings the facts into print with a well written, easy to read, and factual book.<br /><br />Morgan challenges us to do only the logical steps to understand what he is speaking about, like taking that burger out of the bun and actually looking at it.  It's gray and flaccid, industrialized meat product.  He exposes the lies of the industry, like the years long delay McDonald's made on its promise to change out the unhealthy oil they use.  He investigates the impact of McDonalds in other countries and collects varied opinions of them.  He provides disgusting information on the meat industry.  He points out the ties between government lobbyist's and the all powerful food companies, including Sodexho, who provides your children's lunches.  Most importantly, he points out the obvious connection between fast food and diseases that are sweeping our nation, like type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />It's true that the people themselves are the ones ultimately responsible for what they shove into their pieholes, but the fast food industry is notoriously lax on providing truthful information to the masses.  McDonald's nutritional charts are up to thirty percent inaccurate (in their favor) according to the lab results Spurlock obtained from an independent lab.<br /><br />It's true that most issues are skimmed in this book, it is a fairly thin novel, but the pertinent facts are there and are backed up by other media and written materials.  Spurlock makes several references to Fat Land, by Greg Critser, I book I have also read, which goes into far more detail than Don't Eat This Book, but never got the media attention that Spurlock has latched onto.  This is definitely a great, easy-to-read, and informative book that deserves a great deal of attention.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><br />Fat Land by Greg Critser<br /><br />Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser<br /><br />Slaughterhouse by Gail A. Eisnitz<br /><br />These three books will round out and confirm what Spurlock has brought up in this follow up book to his thirty days of hell in fast food heaven.

This hardcover limited edition is numbered and signed by every author, including editor Stephen Mark Rainey and talented cover artist Mike Bohatch.<br /><br />My favorites from the lot would have to be Welcome To The Masque by Jeff VanderMeer, a dark tale that incorporates prejudice and a terrifying jarred exhibit.  From My Reflection, Darkly by David Niall Wilson, a surreal and ghastly tale of exploring unknown realms.  Photos Of A Leg by Scott Thomas, that follows a police investigation into strange and horrible possibilities.  Foreign Bodies by Jeffrey Thomas, explores how we feel about strangers, and how what we guess about knowing them can hurt us.  Embarrassment And Revenge by Rick Kleffel, where a chance accident ushers in a new world of squirming horror.<br /><br />Now You Know by Donald Burleson, teaches us the perils of being too interested in our neighbors, and A Pinch Of Snuff by William R. Trotter, which takes us to the dangerous world of snuff films and abuse of religious zeal.  Jeffrey Osier deserves mention with his ingenious plotline and humorous delivery of Don't Clean The Aquarium, but the dialogue was a little stilted in that tale.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent addition to anyone's horror collection.  If you are a collector then this limited edition will be worth the money for you, but if not, you may want to wait for the price to drop a bit.  Enjoy!A Pinch Of Snuff by William R.

US	52859935	R2YI6PYWT0IEXC	0972085939	575928158	The Fear Report	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Tales of horror with Taboos attached	Massie manages to peel away many layers of humanity here in her collection called The Fear Report.  Would you have an intimate relationship with something less than a torso?  Would you let a traveling peddler give you a colonic?  What kind of treats does your family traditionally serve at Christmas time?  At what point does being sick become too sick?<br /><br />Massie's horror is inside the human soul rather than coming from the form of a monster.  Her characters have a slippery way of justifying their behavior that is a bit disturbing and more than a little intriguing.  Whether you belong to a backwoods family or are a descendent of an ancient South American tribe, you can find something there to rationalize any odd mentality.<br /><br />My favorites from this collection of thirty tales would be Stephen, Fixtures Of Matchstick Men and Joo, Bargains At Binsley's, Day Is Done, Gone The Sun, Stinkin' Rudy, Inside Out, and Dooka Dee.  Whether physical or mental afflictions are involved, or education level, doctorate or drop out, city folk or country folk, no one escapes Massie's imagination.<br /><br />My only problem with this collection is that it is a spendy edition that seems to have been poorly edited.  There are spelling and grammatical errors that are too obvious not to notice, but the artwork inside by Cortney Skinner makes up for the errors.  All in all, a noteworthy collection of both short and flash fiction that any horror lover should appreciate.  Enjoy!	2005-05-17
US	52859935	R2M5MVWKQLP5PR	1931468192	308197289	Ice Tomb	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Intriguing tale of ice plains and moonscapes	Erica Daniels is a brilliant volcanologist whose greatest joy is investigating live volcanoes and studying the crater valleys on the earth left from million year old impacts from meteors.<br /><br />David Marsh is a man struggling with obsessive perfectionism, driven to lie, cheat, and steal in order to impress his overly ambitious father.  Erica and David were lovers in college, until David steals Erica's thesis and presents it as his own, leaving her behind to make his own selfish climb up the NASA ladder of success.<br /><br />Erica has never forgiven David, and becomes furious when she learns that David Marsh has beaten her out of the most coveted assignment to ever appear in her field, a trip to the moon's habitat station to study the craters and dead volcanoes there.<br /><br />Instead, Erica is assigned to investigate a strange \\"hot spot\\" down in Antarctica, not far from the McMurdo Station.  Even stranger is the accompaniment of highly trains Navy SEALS that travel with her, and the unscrupulous archeologist Allan Rocheford, once accused of stripping valuables from an Egyptian dig and selling the priceless treasures to private collectors.<br /><br />Once in Antarctica, Erica is relieved to meet Cathy Jones, a guide assigned to the McMurdo Station, and a companion she can trust other than the SEALS and Allan.  While Erica struggles to make sense of the strange occurrences surrounding her \\"hot spot\\", David finds himself in over his head when sent out to explore the Hadley Rille on the moon.  Separates by more than just miles and space, David and Erica find that their explorations have strange similarities.<br /><br />How could an explosion happen in the vacuum of space?  Why is there bodies preserved in the ice of Antarctica?  Are these new discoveries, or ancient remnants of lost civilization?  The two explorers find themselves thinking of each other more and more often as events unfold that are beyond their expertise and understanding.<br /><br />In spite of the intriguing storyline, there were too many flaws in the book to give it more than three stars.  There are some editing/publisher grammatical errors that stood out too boldly to ignore, and I felt that the characters needed more development beyond their obvious lingering lust for each other.<br /><br />Most disappointing was what was left unsaid and undone at the ending.  Don't get me wrong, the ending was a great way to finish the book, but it needed more fleshing out to give me the lip-smacking satisfaction that I wanted.  There were too many gaping wounds that were passed over, such as how the characters would fit in, and new policies to establish, who would become what and where would the future be leading.  I can't say more without revealing too much of the book, but overall I would say that this is a great vacation read (I myself read it on vacation) or a beach read, but not a book to take too seriously.  I do, however, look forward to more work from Ms. Jackson, as I believe she has talent.  Enjoy!flaws in the book to give it more than three stars.

US	52859935	R1YIOHF92XXSCE	0972085955	869899939	Boneland	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Alternate American history complete with bugs and Guests	Once again I find myself highly recommending a book that is a limited edition, but if you liked George R.R. Martin's 'Sandkings' for the bugs, you will love Thomas's 'Boneland'.  For me, I do not regret one penny spent on this superb tale of morbid history, alien invasion, bug-like mechanisms, and pale humanity.  I could not put it down.<br /><br />Boneland is short, only 167 pages, but covers and amazing amount of ground as it follows the life of John Board, born in Chicago, which is soon to be renamed Coccyx.<br /><br />In 1893, young Johnny's mother hangs herself, her last words being that there were bugs inside her head.  Strange rains of insects had been occurring lately, but though Johnny was too young to make the connection, the history of America was forever changed from how we know it.  The Guests are here.<br /><br />In exchange for being able to observe our violent world, the Guests have provided us with organic, bug-like inventions such as cameras and radios and TVs.  Jeffrey Thomas's vision of such inventions and such a world is so breathtaking and surreal that my only wish is that this was a longer novel.<br /><br />You will follow John Board through his life as a camera man, skillfully manipulating the organic cameras from police work to prison to Hollywood, now known as Boneland.  Board does not trust the Guests, but it is not wise to question them or their Mediums either.<br /><br />Thomas made it easy to envision his world, and skillfully conducted the passage of time throughout John's life, a tale of a man still all too human in a skewered world.  I absolutely loved Thomas's renaming of famous places and things into organic titles, like Mandible's Chinese Theater and Scapula Blvd.  Don't miss out on Boneland, definitely a 10 Star book.  Enjoy!	2005-04-23
US	52859935	R2BH1T7NPHD5JX	1929653565	813157874	The Bleeding Season	Books	5	27	28	N	Y	Stupendous, breathtaking, absorbing, riveting, terrifying...	Do I have your attention yet?  Once in awhile a book comes along that is so well written and so captivating that it leaves you simply breathless in it's wake, and 'The Bleeding Season' is just that book.<br /><br />Using a similar theme to Stephen King's 'The Body' and Robert R. McCammon's 'Boy's Life', one of a group of boys struggling towards adulthood and beyond, 'The Bleeding Season' is no camp follower or second contender to either of the mentioned famous stories.<br /><br />Told in first person by Alan Chance, one of five boys growing up in Potter's Cove, a small town on the coast of rural Massachusetts not far from New Bedford.  Life was seemingly happy until their teens, when Tommy was killed by a careless driver.  Only Alan, Donald, Rick, and Bernard remained, now deprived of their leader.  The boys grow into men, Alan into a failed writer and menial night security job, Rick to a bouncer after a one year stint in prison, Donald into a dead end word processing job, and Bernard into a used car salesman after injuring his knee in Marine training.<br /><br />And then, just shy of their fortieth birthdays, Bernard commits suicide, leaving behind only a duffle bag and a strange recorded message filled with doubts and fear for the rest.  Alan cannot let go of Bernard, feeling compelled to discover the deeper meaning behind Bernard's final and lonely goodbye.  What he uncovers is the stuff that nightmares are made of.<br /><br />Alan, Donald, and Rick find out that Bernard was never who they had thought he was, and slowly begin to uncover a long trail of purely dark evil that had been festering underneath their very noses.  From past to present, Bernard's ghosts and demons begin to haunt their sleep, spewing out bodies in their wakes and leaving behind a sense of utter darkness.  Even when Alan looses first his job and then his wife Toni, he still cannot turn away from the secrets hidden inside their past.<br /><br />Greg F. Gifune's writing is real and raw, deeply poignant, excessively talented, and leaves behind naked emotion painted with words.  Rarely will I read a book that can't be found for less than forty dollars and tell my listeners that it is worth the cost, but 'The Bleeding Season' definitely is.  Buy it, read it, then resell it if you can.  But if you are like me, the impact will be too completely brutal for you to do anything other than clutch the book to your chest as you scream out, 'Why? Why? Why?'<br /><br />Gifune has mastered the creeping horror and intense dread of confronting the darker side of humanity and beyond, the demons that dwell both inside and outside the human flesh, and he serves them up on a shattered platter here for our minds to devour.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough, no aficionado of horror should miss it, definitely a 10 star novel.

US	52859935	R1506MNLBPT8RS	0974503193	280907653	Everybody Scream!	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Everybody loves a carnival, especially one in Punktown...	Fans of Jeffrey Thomas's 'Punktown' are going to love this full novel of Punktown's carnival adventure, but even those who have never journeyed to Punktown should enjoy this alien infested midway within Thomas's dreamy landscape of the planet Paxton, and the city of Punktown.<br /><br />Overflowing with a wide variety of characters, 'Everybody Scream' still narrows most of its focus on Sophi and Del Kahn, owners and operators of Paxton's annual Carnival, a free-for-all of rides, amusement, and murders.  Central to its theme are Mitch Garnet, the Carnival's security chief, Pearl Mason, a singer with a mutant body, and Hector Tomas, a Theta Researcher who has found out the truth behind the multiple dimensions.<br /><br />I am a fan of strange worlds, mutated bodies, oddly imaginative aliens, and a good carnival.  'Everybody Scream' delivers on each of these twisted needs of mine, along with a lot of action on the last day of the carnival's season, plus a sizzling finale that keeps you reading right up to the last page.<br /><br />Worlds collide across dimensions, drugs are bought and sold, corruption seethes underfoot, and people's daily lives float by as you immerse yourself in Thomas's Punktown world.  Thomas does use his strange platform to put out some messages on political issues such as Animal Testing and Animal Rights, but the lessons are not long or tyrannical, more thought-provoking, so if you hold a different view just skip the paragraph and enjoy the book.<br /><br />Thomas is a talented writer that is definitely worth the attention, so don't forget to pick up the anthologies Punktown and Punktown Third Eye, along with the upcoming Punktown Shades Of Gray.  Strange worlds and strange beings, it doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />Take an extra minute to note the fantastic artwork on the cover by David A. Magitis, a very talented artist in my opinion.  Enjoy!	2005-04-21
US	52859935	R2A9BIHTZ7TBYG	0843949996	469585449	Shadow Dreams	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Massie puts the Fun back in Dysfunctional	A friend of mine turned me onto Elizabeth Massie and now I can't chew up enough of the tasty stories she has to dish out, served tenderly on broken shards of glass.  Massie is a horror writer that uses humans as her monsters, and the human mind as the instigator.<br /><br />This lovely book of short stories starts off with `I Am Not My Smell', a truly grotesque tale of a homeless woman accidentally injured, and tells of what extent a sick mind will go to in order to find relief.  If you make it through this story, you're going to love the rest.<br /><br />There are seventeen tales of twisted minds and darkened dreams, easy to read and hard to put down, that will leave you shuddering at night under the feeble light of your lamp, wondering what kind of humans walk through the night outside your own doors.<br /><br />Some of my favorites are `Assault', where a family cowers together in order to stay away from prying government eyes (bit of a surprise here).  `What Happened When Mobsy Paulsen Had Her Painting Reproduced On The Cover Of The Phone Book', a tale of strange and twisted jealousy.  `No Solicitors, Curious A Quarter', a ripe tale of familial caring and secret desire.  `Meat', a tale of family independence.  `Crow, Cat, Cow, Child', a frightening psychological study into Animal Rights Activism, and `Shadow Of The Valley', a blistering look at a cruel prison guard and an innocent man.<br /><br />There's more tales to smack your lips over though, and Massie's easy writing style makes this book of shorts a great beach or travel book, or just something to curl up next to kitty with.  Highly recommended.  Enjoy!	2005-04-15
US	52859935	R3G43FCC61MFRH	0312890729	318023725	King Rat	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Original and dark Pied-Piper tale from the Rat's POV	King Rat is China Mieville's first major novel, and what an entry it is.  However, I will say right at the beginning of this review that if you are new to Mieville, you would do better starting out with Perdido Street Station and progressing to The Scar before reading King Rat.  Mieville can create worlds that boggle the imagination, but the world he creates here in King Rat is an 'alternate London', one seen from the sewers and the eyes of the nocturnal beasts that crawl through them.  Rats mostly, but spiders and birds as well.<br /><br />And this is the world that Saul Garamond is suddenly thrust into, directly following the suspicious suicide of his father.  Roused from sleep and literally drug to the jailhouse for his father's death during the night, Saul is unexpectedly freed from his cell by a strange and supernaturally stealthy and strong figure, who identifies himself as King Rat.<br /><br />Saul's world is forever changed as he finds out who he is and what type of blood runs in his veins.  He embarks on a bold venue of self-discovery, while at the same time trying to figure out what really happened to his father.  Saul is a half-rat, one of the ruler class, and related in some way to King Rat who has rescued him.<br /><br />There are two parallel storylines that merge smoothly in with Saul's, that of his friend Natasha, who remixes `Urban Jungle' club music, and Detective Crowley, who's thankless job it is to pick up after the brutal murders left in Saul's wake, but not of Saul's doing.  Each was very different and intriguing, and provided smooth breaks from the seedy and filthy world Saul now travels.<br /><br />This is a modern day fringe-fantasy story, a story of animal kingdoms and their Kings, a fantasy faery tale of the Pied Piper seen through a twisted set of spectacles perched on the quivering whiskers of rat royalty.  A tale of kings and vermin and human corruption, filled with the flavor of horror, the scent of fantasy, and a ringing in the ears reminiscent of fables.<br /><br />I loved King Rat, and highly recommend China Mieville as one of the brightest new authors on the market today.

US	52859935	RXCJWUF59UZ12	1568583044	726337153	Cities: The Very Best of Fantasy Comes to Town	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Strange new places and odd new themes to tease the brain	Cities is a compilation of four stories by authors who are all masters of their craft; Paul Di Filippo, China Mieville, Michael Moorcock, and Geoff Ryman.<br /><br />Beginning with Paul Di Filippo's `A Year In The Linear City', the book takes off like a bullet from a gun.  Di Filippo's envisioned city is hundreds of thousands of blocks long, but bordered on one side by a river and on the other side by railroad tracks.  Beyond these boundaries exist The Wrong Side Of The Tracks and The Other Shore, places of myth and superstition.  The world is cleansed of their dead by the Fisherwives and the Yardbulls, celestial beings who come for the spirits of the dead.  This is a truly outstanding tale of a strange city in a strange world, with compelling characters and original plotline.  Need I say more?<br /><br />Next is China Mieville's `The Tain', a unique and horrifying tale of what lays in wait behind our own mirrors.  Call it a tale of vampires, or a tale of spectral imagery, a curse behind vanity, or a strange sci-fi-fantasy yarn of alternate universe/reality, but what it really amounts to is a chilling tale that is well worth picking up this book strictly for `The Tain' by itself.<br /><br />Michel Moorcock's `Firing The Cathedral' would be the one letdown in the book, regardless of what high esteem I hold Moorcock in.  This is a `Jerry Cornelius' adventure, but I think even fans of Moorcock's `Jerry' will find this short story to be just a tad too meandering.  Moorcock is an extremely talented writer whom I felt was merely left wandering through the haze of useless obliqueness when this story was conceived.  `Cathedral' touches down into the prose style of \\"guess what I'm thinking\\" sci-fi jumbles that I usually try to avoid. The writing was just a little too disjointed, and Moorcock is normally much better than this individual story.<br /><br />Last of the collection is `V.A.O.' by Geoff Ryman, perhaps not as well known as the other three authors, but he writes a masterpiece with this tale of elderly inhabitants of a nursing home.  V.A.O. stands for Victim Activated Ordinance, a security system put into place to protect the wealthy elders from the violent youths of the time.  Or is it the elderly who are violent?  In a closely monitored `home', these aged folks hide their computer codes beneath videos of golf matches, codes that launder money and track the activities of The Silhouette, leader of the `Age Rage' gang.<br /><br />Cities is an outstanding addition to your collection of strange places to go, and I highly recommend you pick up a copy if you are a fan of any one of these four talented authors.  If you aren't now, you soon will be.  Enjoy!rites a masterpiece with this tale of elderly inhabitants of a nursing home.

I strongly urge you to first pick up `Perdido Street Station', and if you like that, then read `The Scar'.  Only then will you have the background, and the appropriate taste in your mouth, for `Iron Council'.<br /><br />As much as I love China Mieville, as much as I will continue to rant and rave about his amazing expertise with prose and world building, I still had a bit of difficulty with `Iron Council'.  The story, as other reviewers have mentioned, takes far too long to find its feet, and is still slow to take off running.  China's prose slid into more of a vague sci-fi \\"guess what I'm building\\" rather than the rich and exotically nourishing scenarios painted in his previous works.  I would have liked for there to be a bit more New Crobuzon in the book, and a bit less of the (seemingly) non-essential travels over miles of nothingness.<br /><br />Still, China Mieville is one of my absolute favorite authors, and on his worst days can beat the bullets out of any other author.  He is extremely talented, and destined to become one of the greats, IMHO.<br /><br />Judah Low sets out to find the Iron Council, and bring them back to New Crobuzon, where the new Parliament is fighting against rebellious factions that will later join to become The Collective.  Cutter, a devotee of Judah's, tracks him down and refuses to leave his side as he seeks out the Council he was once a part of.<br /><br />Back in New Crobuzon, Ori finds his way from street theater dissident into the seditious faction of Toro, through a strange homeless man named Spiral Jacobs.  Ori wants to help New Crobuzon rise above the oppression of the Parliament, blindly following Toro's gang through their military maneuvers to gain access to the Mayor.  Eventually, Ori and Judah will cross paths, but what happens may not be in the best interest of New Crobuzon at all.<br /><br />`Iron Council' is definitely a worthwhile read, but again, I urge you to read the two previously mentioned books first.  They will lay a necessary groundwork for this tale that, I believe, would leave it a bit empty without padding laid in place by \\"Perdido Street Station' and `The Scar'.  I can't wait for Mieville to put out another book, and have already picked up `Cities', a newly re-released collection edited by Peter Crowley, in while Michael Moorcock, Paul Di Dilippo, and Geoff Ryman join Mieville in telling strange tales of strange cities.<br /><br />Enjoy!e read, but again, I urge you to read the two previously mentioned books first.

But his fascination is our entertainment, as he writes in flowing prose his observations of these nasty little crawlers.  The Red Hourglass is an extremely well-written account of the habits and habitats of things that creep in the night.<br /><br />The book is divided into seven different studies, Black Widow, Mantid, Rattlesnake, Tarantula, Pig, Canid, and Recluse.  Though Grice gives fascinating accounts of the darker aspects of pigs and dogs, it is painfully clear in his writings that his love is truly for the spider.<br /><br />The Red Hourglass is a non-fiction book that is written with such interesting and personal observations that it feels somewhat like a monster story at times.  If you want to find out more about these creepy, crawly, nasty little arachnids, Grice is an excellent way to learn.  This would be a great book to get kids started on taking interest with biology or even anthropology studies, it's that well written<br /><br />And I hate spiders.  Go ahead and grab up a copy of The Red Hourglass, I doubt you will ever find non-fiction reading as fun as Grice, having the same flair with his biology studies as Kurt Eicheneald does with his political studies.

Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the sex overdone at all, in the case of the child it was simply hinted at in real life, but painted that dark shade of horrid from the mind of the abuser.  Atypically well done for this type of no-no subject.<br /><br />No monster or vampire or ghastly apparition can ever be more horrifying than an abuser of children, a sick control freak who preys on the innocent to feed himself.  This is horror in its truest form, the everyday form of humanity.<br /><br />Young Davy Boyce watches his stepfather Chet kill his mother, a pattern Chet has established before in order to gain control over young male children.  But unlike Chet's other victims, Davy stops talking and begins to display very disturbed behavior, such as biting.  After an incident in Davy's class in where he bites both a fellow student and the teacher, Davy is sent to a special school in the hopes that artistic psychotherapy can help him.<br /><br />Celia Griswold works at the Bentman Children's Center in rural Oregon where Davy is sent to, and uses drawing and art to try and pull Davy out of his silence.  Celia has her own problems with a wandering husband, her own desire to have children, a wandering sheep herder that has moved his flock near their land, and a new boss who doesn't understand the therapy she excels in.  Davy's artwork points to something very wrong with Davy's homelife, but Celia's extremely clinical boss refuses to recognize Celia's suspicions.<br /><br />Chet, in the meantime, has his own agenda for Davy.  Feeling forced into bringing Davy to the Center and trying to hide his dark secrets long enough to take full advantage of the boy in his custody, Chet sees Celia as a threat to his plans.  With his psychopathic cunning, Chet embarks on his own sick mission to distract Celia from Davy, and instill enough fear in her for her to let go of her suspicions about the boy.<br /><br />`Hush' is Nykanen's first novel, and while it has a few problems with the POV flow at times, it doesn't take the reader long to figure out who's mind they are in because of Nykanen's excellent characterizations.  I really liked these people, Davy was a real victim, no miracles here, and Celia was easy to relate to.  Chet was nothing more than pure evil, and the lush forest surroundings came to life as I walked them on Celia's hikes through the hills.<br /><br />Don't miss your opportunity to get acquainted with this fresh new author.  `Hush' will leave you gasping for air and wanting to sink a long knife into every child molester on the planet without a moment's hesitation.  This is a work of fiction that brings true life horror to the page.

In `Perdido Street Station', China Mieville wrote a piece of literary artwork, and The Scar carries on his tradition of excellence and distinctiveness, trudging far ahead of traditional Science Fiction, Fantasy, Cyberpunk, or Horror.  Unique is too simple a word to describe the lushness of Mieville's works.<br /><br />With `Perdido Street Station', we plunged deep into the heart of the teeming city of New Crobuzon, following a scientist named Isaac through a deadly and startling discovery.  The Scar takes place years later, following a former lover of Isaac's named Bellis Coldwine as she flees New Crobuzon and its militia.<br /><br />Taking passage on the ship Terpsichoria as a linguist/translator, hoping to find a new life in the distant colony of Nova Esperium, she is horrified when the pirates of the floating city of Armada overtake the Terpsichoria and kill all the ranking officers.  The passengers, along with the hold filled with Remade prisoners, are taken to Armada and forced to make a new life on the strange conglomeration of lashed together ships turned into a makeshift city.<br /><br />Bellis is homeless and friendless, and deeply resentful of Armada for forcing her to live out her life in Armada.  Out of the handful of people she knows, Uther Doul, a strange and forbidding warrior, Johannes Tearfly, a naturalist, and Silas Fennec, a shady man with a shady past and shady plans.  The vast flotilla is divided into districts, one of which is run by The Brucolac, a Vampir, one of my favorite characters.  We will also follow the life of Tanner Sack, one of the Remade prisoners that had been aboard the Terpsichoria with Bellis, who finds his life on Armada much better than what awaited him in Nova Esperium.<br /><br />In the high district of Garwater are The Lovers, a male and female who run Armada together in public, and in private scar themselves with mirror image patterns.  The Lovers have conceived the idea of harnessing an avanc, a monster of the sea, and use its power to travel to The Scar, a place where the world of Bas Lag was ruptured long ago.<br /><br />With The Scar, as it was with `Perdido Street Station', the city of Armada becomes a character as much as the people and Remade that populate it.  Mieville writes so well that you can smell and taste and feel the city, its beauty and its corruption, and will find yourself as drawn into its journey as if you yourself lived there.<br /><br />One of the absolute high points that must be mentioned is Armada's journey to a strange island where the mosquito people called Anophelii live.  Only a prodigious and fecund mind could come up with such an astonishing creature, the males gentle and intelligent and the females ravenously dangerous.<br /><br />There is simply too much in this book to even begin to describe its depth and vision, it is simply a book that you must pick up and read thoroughly.  It has tension, adventure, splendor, mythological vision, action, betrayal, twists, and a vivid depth that few authors have ever been capable of achieving.  The Scar is not a beach or travel read, this is a book that deserves the armchair, a piece of chocolate cheesecake, a rich ruby port, and a cup of aromatic coffee.  If you purchase one book this year, make it The Scar, it is absolutely worth the long savoring it deserves.

Touted as being both gritty and shocking, I found that it fell flat simply because of Selby's writing style.  The surrealistic prose that added delirium to `Requiem For A Dream' only provides detachment when Selby paints his `Brooklyn' characters.<br /><br />Perhaps in the 50's this book was a bold play on drugs, prostitution, homosexuality, and futility, but it hasn't stood the test of time, in my own humble opinion, like `Requiem For A Dream' has.<br /><br />Divided into almost separate stories that document different characters from the neighborhood, `Brooklyn' is a choppy and difficult story to follow.  Larry Brown has painted horrid characters that still compel me to read more about them, but I simply could not get around the surreal angle to a group of misfits with no depth to them.<br /><br />We meet a gang of thugs at a diner in a squalid neighborhood in the chapter `Another Day, Another Dollar', a drag queen named Georgette who dances around and pops bennies like gumdrops in `The Queen Is Dead', an uninteresting short about Tommy, his baby, and a motorcycle in `And Baby Makes Three', follow a service-for-substance prostitute in `Tra-La-La', meet a lazy and stupefying ignorant machine worker who falls in love with a drag queen during his union's strike in `Strike', and wind through the dull and primitive lives of the tenants in a low rent project in `Landsend'.  That's it.<br /><br />Of all the tales, `Strike' was the only one that kept any cohesiveness to it, the rest just drifted in and out of focus on a long, meandering path to nowhere.  It's not that the characters in the book weren't vulgar and course, but I felt all the while like I was just peeking at them through a scummy window, not involved, no pain or despair leaking through to me.  I want to be able to feel the grit between my teeth, to taste the exquisite flavors of misery, human disintegration, and worthlessness, and smell the tangy aroma of demoralized failure.  `Brooklyn' simply doesn't satisfy the palate.<br /><br />If you want to pick up a good Selby novel, then grab Requiem For A Dream instead of Last Exit To Brooklyn.worthlessness, and smell the tangy aroma of demoralized failure.  `Brooklyn' simply doesn't satisfy the palate. <br /> <br />If you want to pick up a good Selby novel, then grab Requiem For A Dream instead of Last Exit To Brooklyn. <br /> <br />	2005-03-01

The Horror Writers Association has a reputation for putting out anthologies every few years, each with a central theme and a talented editor.  From circus freaks to vampires to haunted airports, HWA has been consistent in gathering up talent to compose its collections.<br /><br />Whitley Strieber was chosen to edit `Aliens', but unfortunately did not add a short story of his own.  However, you will find such talent as Edward Lee, Gary Braunbeck, David Silva, P.D. Cacek, and Don D'Ammassa; twenty-one tales in all that will entertain, amuse, and sometimes frighten you.<br /><br />Forget about the movie aliens, these are intruders who sometimes look like us, sometimes mean us harm and sometimes don't, are sometimes stupid and sometimes smart, but always have an uncanny interest in this little blue ball called Earth.  They are here, and the reasons are abundant.<br /><br />With Braunbeck's `In Hollow Houses', a child is saved from an abusive household.  In Nina Kiriki Hoffman's `Radiance', you can donate your body to the aliens by checking a box on your drivers license.  Find out how an alien who travels from body to body keeps track of his human lover in James Robert Smith's `A Last, Longing Look'.  Mix aliens and compulsive gambling and you get John B. Rosenman's `Even Saints And Angels'.  Follow some lost and friendly crash-landers through acceptance and then rejection in Cindie Geddes' `Guessing At The Unknown' (my favorite).  Alien or angel?  Edward Lee's `Scripture Girl' holds the answer.  Contemplate how aliens will use us in the afterlife with Adam-Troy Castro's `Fuel'.  Don D'Ammassa's `Realizations' ponders an alien visitor as a sneaky jail-breaker or miracle baby, and P.D. Cacek's `Fireflies' tiptoes through the cruelties of a little girl being crippled, and how she can unwittingly cripple in return.<br /><br />Altogether, this is a pleasing and versatile collection of old-fashioned, sci-fi based alien tales, and to me, extremely welcomed proof that horror comes from the inside.  Though a few others have mentioned being disappointed in the lack of overt horror, I welcome a collection that allows these multitalented writers the freedom to stretch their scorched and blackened wings, allowing them to occasionally shimmer like gossamer mantles in this cold, alien light.

She also meets an old, one-legged Khmer named Samnang who is the work boss on the excavation site.<br /><br />She spends a month with the RE-1 unit, enchanted by the strange morning people who wander through the early mists, and by an odd gypsy boy who skirts the site like a feral dog.  But when she finds American remains in a deep well, she and the other civilians are evicted from the site and sent home.  While having dinner at a local restaurant with Duncan and Kleat, the gypsy boy shows up with American dog tags and says he can lead them to the burial site.  Taking Samnang and three local brothers, the three set off to find out if what the gypsy boy promised was true.<br /><br />A long drive through the night, past a strange rain of tiny frogs, they discover ancient ruins buried deep inside the Cambodian forest, primitive and eerie, dating far before any of the ruins Duncan has studied.  Conflict begins immediately, with Kleat insisting their focus be on uncovering the missing men, Duncan wanting to explore the strange city, and the locals hired by Samnang wanting to plunder the relics.<br /><br />It doesn't take long to discover that there is something strangely alive about this ancient place, and Molly is determined to find out what it is, in spite of the rising tensions and the threat from both a typhoon and the upcoming monsoons.  She will uncover more than her story here, finding answers to her quest for her real parents and to the strange behaviors of her companions.<br /><br />Just as Long did with his previous work, `The Descent', he is able to paint a mystical atmosphere that literally comes alive with its creeping mists, sultry humidity, aggressive growth, and mystical ruins that crouch under the canopy of the lush jungles.  I could feel the atmosphere, the sense of urgency, the dread, and the excitement that pulls Molly deep into mysterious puzzle of the missing soldiers and the city itself.<br /><br />Jeff Long is proving himself to be one of my favorite authors, someone I can compare to Michael Crichton with his ability to make me grab up a hardcopy the minute it is released.

He does present extensive additional reading materials and a complete index, so even with a lack of reference he does not leave you in the dark should you decide further study is in order.<br /><br />`Why Sex Is Fun' is really just an anthropological muse, Diamond giving you the feeling that you are sitting in a caf&eacute; with him, kicking back, drinking some wine, and mulling over an interesting subject with well schooled friend.<br /><br />He thoroughly examines the separation of man from ape in our breeding signals and patterns, but leaves out significant sociological factors that held the hand of the human boxes as we evolved up and away from lower-brained species, leaving behind many instinctual behaviors in favor of the intellectual.<br /><br />However, from a strictly anthropological view, this book is interesting, well written, well formatted, and a welcome addition to Diamond's previous `Guns, Germs, and Steel' and `The Third Chimpanzee'.<br /><br />You will find yourself pondering questions such as, Why do human females hide ovulation?  Why do human females shut down fertility (menopause)?  What is the benefit of the human female being receptive to $ex even when she is not ovulating?  What makes human males `stick around' rather than spread their genes as far and wide as possible?  Why don't men lactate? (*shudder*)  And the favorite chapter for the ladies, What are men good for? Which studies the evolutionary role of the human male.<br /><br />`Why Is Sex Fun?' is an informative read with a dash of fun, challenging enough for anthropology students and yet written for laymen to enjoy also.

This really isn't a story of Sara or Harry or Marion or Tyrone, but about Addiction and how it changes their lives forever, triumphing over the good that they once held in their hearts.<br /><br />Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow, receives a phone call telling her that she has one a chance to be a contestant on a television show.  With television already her constant companion, Sara becomes extremely excited and vows to loose weight so that she can fit into her red dress for the show.  But loneliness and diets don't work well together, so Sara goes to a doctor and gets diet pills.<br /><br />Sara's son Harry is a junkie, and when he and his friend Tyrone Love come across some `dyn-o-mite' heroin, they hatch plans to score a pound of pure, dreaming that this will be their ticket to the easier life they long for.  Harry's girlfriend Marion is a wanna-be artist who is waiting for life to happen to her, and she believes she has found what she had been seeking with Harry.<br /><br />Their addictions grow, eating alive everything important to our four characters, their dreams, their hopes, their love, their friendships, their health, and their souls.  This is the story of a savage beast running rampant through their lives, devouring humanity without regard or regret.<br /><br />What really impacted me the most was the horrors Sara and Harry suffer at the hands of medical professionals, under the brutal pretexts of pride, profit, ignorance, routine, efficiency, and prejudice.  The disregard for these human lives by the doctors who run the institutions and judge the behavior over the illness is gut-wrenching in its heartlessness.  The inhuman cruelty of these doctorate-carrying monsters exceeds anything their own monsters created.<br /><br />Selby's prose is difficult to get into at first, unique in that it is a meandering and strewn-together style not often seen or read.  Everything flows together, thoughts and spoken words, with minimal punctuation and entirely without quotation marks to indicate spoken text.  Stick with it, as the story begins to unfold you will find the style lending itself to the surreal and dreamlike flow of the character's lives, and as you slide into their hopes and dreams, their cravings and failures, Selby's style becomes less and less an obstruction and more of an enhancement to the nightmare he has painted so well for us.<br /><br />If you liked the movie, you will like the book, and if you like the book you will like the movie.  Also of note is the stupendously dark score to the movie by The Kronos Quartet, bring audio impact to the downward spiral so artistically illustrated in `Requiem For A Dream'.

Shane Scully from Cannell's Tin Collectors is back in action, this time with beautiful girlfriend and fellow police officer Alexa Hamilton at his side, along with his son Chooch.  `The Viking Funeral', while studded with as much action as The Tin Collectors, takes us into the darker side of Shane's loneliness as he questions his own humanity.<br /><br />Driving down the Los Angeles freeway, Sergeant Shane Scully sees the impossible, his dead friend Jody driving through the traffic.  Unable to let the image go, Shane soon discovers that Jody is indeed alive when he is kidnapped by The Vikings, a group of renegade cops who have faked their own deaths and gone deep undercover.  Shane must appear that he has gone south with The Vikings, and arranges to fake the shooting of the acting head of the Detective Services Group, his own finance Alexa Hamilton.<br /><br />Unknown to Shane, Jody has reloaded his weapon with real firepower, and when Shane sees Alexa go down in blood, his world begins to tremble.  With The Vikings, Shane gets involved with a cash laundering scheme that stretches from Los Angeles to Aruba to the Columbian border, and with the image of Alexa haunting his dreams and waking nightmares, Shane searches for a thread that will still tie him not only to LAPD but also to his own humanity.<br /><br />The Viking Funeral is non-stop action, traveling far and wide with an on-the-edge group of psychopathic cops into the deep corruption of the drug markets.  I had to re-read The Viking Funeral just to appreciate the depth of the emotionless tomb that Shane almost buries himself in.<br /><br />Cannell's books read like a movie in my head, his written words easily flowing into images that quickly imbed themselves into my spongy gray matter.  It's a gift for an author to achieve this level of visual to his readers, and one that I thank him for having.<br /><br />Fans of Cannell like myself are going to be overwhelmed with the treat in store with the return of LAPD Sergeant Shane Scully, and if you are new into Cannell, you will need to read The Tin Collectors first to appreciate the full impact The Viking Funeral brings to our everyday hero, Shane.  I liked Shane Scully because he is not always right, often has doubts, can be blindly impulsive, and in other words comes across as a real human being rather than a super-hero with a badge.

Shane and Alexa Scully are back in action again, this time staying pretty much on home turf but up against the toughest assignment either of them have ever had.  Friend and fellow officer from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, Emo Rojas is brutally gunned down routinely serving a warrant.  However, the Sheriff's department took the warrant from the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms federal unit.  Emo is dead in the \\"Vertical Coffin\\", police slang for a doorway, and chaos runs rampant as Shane arrives on the scene.<br /><br />What follows is a burned out husk of a house that once contained a psychopath named Vincent Smiley, who all departments believed was a \\"suicide by cop\\" incident where he met the onslaught of officers on the scene with AK-47 gunfire and Kevlar body protection.  Now the Sheriff's department and the Federal ATF department are at war, arguing over who was to blame for Emo's death in the Vertical Coffin.  Shane finds himself in the middle of this cop war as he is assigned to investigate the incident as a neutral LAPD officer.<br /><br />In this latest installment of Shane Scully adventures, get ready for the ride of your life.  Not everything is what it seems to be, for Shane's finds bizarre clues buried in the ashes of Vincent Smiley's home, and as he seeks to unravel the mysteries, more and more officers begin to die in Vertical Coffins, leaving the two agencies frothing at the mouth for each other's blood.  There are more twists and deeper characterization in this novel, really fleshing out Shane and Alexa, allowing us to see different angles of the man inside.<br /><br />Also noteworthy, this is the first Scully novel that Stephen J. Cannell has written in `First Person' format, giving a more personal feel to Shane's inner workings and emotions, and jacking up the action another notch.  You will meet two great characters in this book, Josephine Brickhouse and Royal Mortenson, who Cannell did a great job in bringing to life, each of which will touch Shane's life in a profound way.<br /><br />This is my favorite Shane Scully novel to date, and I am looking forward to more Scully novels to come, although I deeply enjoy the novels Cannell does outside of his Shane Scully world also.

Shane and Alexa are back in action, now married and living in Shane's small house in Venice CA with Shane's son Chooch.  Alexa's long time friend Nora Bishop is getting married, and after a series of bad boyfriends she has finally landed Farrell Champion, big name movie producer.<br /><br />When Alexa and Shane attend a party splattered with big name stars at Farrell's house, Shane runs into a no-name street grifter from the streets named Nicky Marcella.  Nicky claims to be running a legitimate movie production company named Cine-Roma, and also claims to be partnered with Champion.  He asks Shane for a favor in return for all the informing he had done in the past for LAPD, namely, find a girl named Carol White that Nicky wanted to star in his next movie.<br /><br />Alexa is called away from the party for a big-time gang shooting, and as Shane is leaving separately, he overhears Farrell mentioning something about poisoning his two previous wives.  Shane proceeds to find Carol, a used up junkie selling her body for fixes, and also discovers a strange plot to overtake the IATSE union by a mobster named Dennis Valentine from back east.  When Carol is found brutally murdered, her death touches Shane deep inside, bring him face to face with the demons that keep him on the police force.<br /><br />Shane realizes that somehow, Nicky, Dennis, Farrell, and the gang shootings are related, and vows to avenge Carol's useless death by discovering the truth behind the bizarre mob connections in the glamorous world of show business.<br /><br />While Cannell's `The Viking Funeral' took a turn into the darker side of existence, `Hollywood Tough' makes up for it by skirting along an almost comedic edge of the seedier side of the movie industry.  There's a script that makes no sense to be purchased from a Scientology-type religious fanatic, the movie star Michael Fallon who has so many phobias he has to track them on paper, a producer named Paul Lubick who's ego is only outsized by the massive redwood trees he imports for a ceiling shot, and Nicky Marcella's buzz-word wanna-be actions.<br /><br />This time Shane may have bitten off more than he can chew, and as he slides into his own undercover world of glamour and glitz, he realizes the seductress's pull of the lifestyle and how close he finds himself submitting to its temptations.  Also introduced in `Hollywood Tough' is Chooch's girlfriend Delfina, who to me turned out to be disappointingly shallow in comparison to the other brightly painted characters from the story.<br /><br />Cannell again uses words to graphically sketch a rolling video in my head, the plot folding and twisting around one of my favorite book-cops of all.

The Book Of All Flesh is Lowder's first Zombie Anthology, followed by The Book Of More Flesh and The Book Of Final Flesh.  I happened to read `More Flesh' first, and quickly trotted out to purchase the other two books.  Lowder has indeed put together a stellar collection of shambling tales that will haunt the dark corners of your mind long after you thumbed through the last, richly painted page.<br /><br />Just when you think the subject of Zombies had died its final death, Lowder raises it up from its crumbling grave and feeds it to us with squishy delights from many talented authors.<br /><br />Scott Nicholson answers the burning question of how Zombies love in his tale `Murdermouth', Steve Eller gives a grisly twist in Zombie survival in `Consumption', Christine Morgan presents a tongue-in-cheek, politically correct treatment in `Dawn Of The Living-Impaired', Kenneth Lightner's `Number Of The Beast' tells in diary and police-report style a tale of science gone awry, Michael Laimo's nightmare tale of survival in `Last Resort', Gregory G. Kurcznski gives Henry the love he always wanted in `Same Night Different Farmhouse', Robert E. Vardeman takes a corporate twist in `Middles', Jeremy Zoss will make you laugh with `Electric Jesus And The Living Dead', and Scott Eldeman will sing a calmly, bittersweet tale of love in `Live People Don't Understand.'<br /><br />More great authors include Mark McLaughlin, Joe Murphy, L.J. Washburn, Scot Noel, Pete D. Manison, Ed Greenwood, Jim C. Hines, Daniel Ksenych, C. Dean Anderson, Robin D. Laws, Tobias S. Buckell, Aaron T. Solomon, Matt Forbeck, John C. Hay, L.H.

US	52859935	RZ7GLDVVFV8Y8	043935806X	667539744	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)	Books	4	2	7	N	N	Harry Potter and The Fat-Book Publisher with Dealines	Yes, I am a rabid fan of the Harry Potter series.  I bought the first book when J.K. Rowling was first introduced to the US and fell in love with the series.  But...Order Of The Phoenix fell short of my expectations and definitely does not meet Rowling's own standard of writing ability.  The book reads like it was a task to fill in XXX amount of pages in XXX amount of time, leaving our plunge back into the world of Potter as shallow as a skipping stone.<br /><br />I notice that other fans have mentioned Harry's inappropriate anger in this installment, and I have to agree with them.  It gets tiresome to hear him spout off over and over again about his self-conceived woes, and I kept waiting for Hermione or Ron to tell him to take a Chill-Pill.<br /><br />The basic plot introduces us to the Order Of The Phoenix, a group of well-intentioned wizards who believe in Voldemort's return and have vowed to oppose him.  Harry gets caught up in the middle of their plans, and heroically tries to stop Voldemort from getting his hands on a \\"secret weapon\\", ending with another exciting, although typical, David and Goliath finsih.  Buried inside almost 900 pages is a thrilling 300 page story, its just very difficult to sift through the rest of the filler to find it.<br /><br />I must make a quick mention of the new villain, Professor Delores Umbridge, a weaselly and conniving old biddy whose sweet exterior masks a contemptible interior of pure evil.  Unfortunately, while suitably unsavory, she came across as the scariest villain of all, even over the Death Eaters.<br /><br />I'm giving this four stars instead of the three and a half it deserves, simply because I admire Rowling's talent and hope that in Blood Prince she returns to her older format of storyline over number-of-pages.  I just read a novel of only 262 pages that had more `Ummph' that the repetitive 870 pages of Phoenix.<br /><br />On another interesting note, I found it odd that while the storyline does cater to a younger crowd, the mere size of an 870 page book can be intimidating to children with reading disabilities who would otherwise gulp down such a tale.  With Attention Deficit Disorder running rampant through our school-age kids, a more compact and less rambling tale would serve to entice far more children into reading books that this lengthy addition to the Potter saga.  The old adage of Quality over Quantity holds true even with such a famous name as Harry Potter.

With her husband away all summer on business, Christine's social life centers around Rhoda, her effervescent neighbor Mrs. Monica Breedlove, Monica's brother Emory, and the shifty groundskeeper Leroy Jessup.<br /><br />Christine is a gentle and well-bred lady, and often looks upon her daughter's fastidious dress and immaculate room and wonders how she deserved such a beautiful, normal child.  On the morning of the Fern Grammar School annual picnic, Rhoda is already up and dressed, her hair neatly braided, and eager to go.  Christine and Mrs. Breedlove drop Rhoda off with the three aging Fern sisters, Miss Octavia, Miss Burgess, and Miss Claudia, who take the children to their old home at Pelican Bay.<br /><br />When a little boy mysteriously drowns at the picnic, the same little boy who won the penmanship medal that Rhoda had wanted so badly, Christine's world begins to fall apart with doubts.  Memories flood back to her of Rhoda's strange friendship with an old woman back in Baltimore who had promised Rhoda her opal necklace when she died, the same necklace that hangs in Rhoda's room.  Memories of the school Rhoda was expelled from for telling lies and being \\"a cold, self-sufficient child who plays by her own rules\\".<br /><br />Christine turns to Emory's friend Reginald Tasker, who is writing a novel about females who have committed atrocious murders, and in his research she finds something terribly familiar.  In the meantime, the Fern Sisters have informed Christine that Rhoda will not be welcomed back next year to the Fern Grammar School, stating that \\"they can do nothing for her in their environment.\\"<br /><br />Christine begins to wonder, when she looks upon her daughter, whether she is gazing at the angel or the beast.  As the summer unfolds, Christine digs deeper into Reginald's research, fearful of what she will find and terrified not to learn more of her and Rhoda's past, until Rhoda takes a bold step and openly shows her mother where the real truth lies.<br /><br />The well-bred gentility of the characters, their languid and imperturbable lifestyles, is what gives The Bad Seed such creepiness.  Looking for a black spot in a picture filled with pretty flowers is harder than looking for one in a dreary landscape, but when you find it, it seems to grow until it mars the entire painting.<br /><br />That is the feeling I got reading The Bad Seed, the creeping sensation of low terror that shudders like a soft vibration down your spine, leaving you uneasy and often short of breath.  The Bad Seed is a must-read for any horror fan, simply because the soft touch of death will kill as certainly as the bludgeon.

He is the major contributor to NERF, the National Environmental Research Fund, which is headed by famous litigator Nicolas Drake.  Morton discovers a shady transaction involving Drake, and turns to his young attorney Peter Evans and beautiful assistant Sarah Jones to help him find some answers.  Enter Professor John Kenner from MIT and his assistant Sanjong Thapa, who hold a mysterious private meeting with George Morton.<br /><br />After his meeting with Kenner, Morton voices his concerns about NERF to Peter, but never reveals the entire story.  His behavior becomes unstable and his drinking out of control, until he crashes his Ferrari after giving an unexpected announcement at a NERF fund raising banquet.  Drake is outraged by Morton's decision not to fund NERF, and challenges young Peter Evans on Morton's last will and testament.  Morton's promised donation was the key funding source for NERF's lawsuit against the EPA on behalf of the small island Vanutu, claiming that the USA has polluted the planet to the point of raising the global sea level and ruining the Vanutu people's ancestral home.<br /><br />Morton left behind many mysteries, and together Peter Evans and Sarah Jones set out to discover the truth behind his actions before his death.  Joining up with Professor Kenner, they travel from Beverly Hills to the Antarctic to Arizona to the south sea island of Gareda.  Barely avoiding disaster at each stop, the unlikely trio are in a race against time to uncover the truth behind NERF's real intentions.<br /><br />Michael Crichton has done it again, taking a fictional backdrop heavily peppered with enough fact to make me truly BELIEVE in the events unfolding on his pages.  Just like Jurassic Park, Airframe, and Disclosure, Crichton has put together a non-stop thriller that left me reading well into the wee hours of the morning.  His characters are fully-fleshed, real live individuals with their own strengths and faults, pulling you along through their nightmare world of sabotage, betrayal, and greed.<br /><br />Part of what makes this book so fun is the footnotes pointing to real life research that Crichton used to build his fictional scenario.  He includes an extensive bibliography and personal commentary at the end of the book.<br /><br />State Of Fear is an extremely fast-paced, highly emotional book that leaves you wondering where the line of right and wrong is to be drawn, and who the real bad guys are.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.

He is just a guy who wants to do right by his children who live with his ex-wife and give something back to the community.  He is a low-key and easy going Doctor who is finding more and more frustration in catering to the HMO's demands for red-tape procedure.<br /><br />First he finds himself on a debate floor of the Hippocrates Society with HMO Corporate giant Boyd Halliday, earning attention he preferred to shy away from, then next thing he knows he is drugged in his own hospital just before performing a surgery, victim of a setup.  He finds himself relieved of his position, accused of drug abuse, and shunned by the Society that once trusted him.<br /><br />Police Sergeant Patricia Moriarity finds herself assigned to a prominent case, the recent serial murders of HMO executives, with her chauvinistic partner Wayne Brasco.  Her research leads her to the Hippocrates Society debate where she first meets Dr. Grant, feeling an immediate but unwelcome attraction to him.<br /><br />After Will is suspended from FSA, he and Patty team up in a joint effort to find out who set Will up, and who is responsible for the horrible murders, believing the two incidents to be related.  Watched by the police and tracked by a killer, Will and Patty embark on a frightening investigation that could lead them both to their deaths.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Michael Palmer, and to explain, I gave this book four stars instead of five because it doesn't live up to Palmer's own standards of writing.  In The Society, I found his protagonist to be uncharacteristically shallow, lacking the vibrancy that Palmer usually injects into his stories.  Both Will and Patty just seemed to be a bit flat, one-dimensional, and it was hard to empathize with them at times.<br /><br />The plot does twist and turn, and there are surprises that will pop up along the way, but the most interesting point of The Society is that the HMO horror stories Palmer highlights in this book are real.  In his introduction, he talks of using his website to collect real HMO disaster stories, and gives credit to those who's tales he borrowed.<br /><br />All in all, The Society is a very good medical thriller, and I will still buy Palmer in hardback addition without any regret.

US	52859935	R25BKNXFGNKDZ3	0765306050	271416341	Scared Stiff: Tales of Sex and Death	Books	5	7	7	N	N	The deadly art of seduction	Clive Barker's introduction is as good as the stories themselves, stating in regards to the melding of horror and erotica that \\"In an age when characters in all manner of fiction have forsaken their blushes to fornicate, horror fiction clings to its underwear with a nunnish zeal.\\"  Since Scared Stiff was first published in 1988, this was one of the influential books that led to the production of more erotica in horror, such as the Hot Blood series.<br /><br />There are only seven tales in this collection, making it a wonderful traveling companion or vacation book.  Starting with `Dolls', we visit a quiet village and the witch's coven that conjures the devil during orgies, leading to `The Other Woman', a tale of an artist's obsession with his work bleeding over onto the canvas of his own life.<br /><br />Next is `Liliths', probably my favorite story in the compilation.  A strange shop appears out of nowhere, and a man makes a purchase that changes his life.  A life sized doll that fills him with compulsive behavior.<br /><br />`The Seductress' is a low-key suspense tale, of obsessive love and a mother's revenge.  `Stages' tells of us a deadly combination of $ex, drugs, and voyeurism.  `Loveman's Comeback' speaks of possession, and the lengths one will go to in order to break out of a bad relationship.  And finally, `Merry May' is about wandering into a strange town, and finding their odd celebration a little more than you can handle.<br /><br />While in comparison to today's erotic horror, Scared Stiff is a bit tame for this blossoming genre, but Ramsey Campbell's early foray into this forbidden realm truly opened doors for those of us who enjoy peeking into the bloody rooms to find titillating delights within.  If you are really a fan of visceral lust run amok, then you should own a copy of Scared Stiff.  Enjoy!	2005-01-18

Only after I got it home did I realize that one of the author's was Spike Lee's wife.  This, in all honesty, led me to believe that it would be shallow and it's publication purchased by lots of money.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Although the book starts a little slow as we slide into the lives of the protagonists, you absolutely MUST read it until the end, which will leave you beaming with gleeful delight.  `Nuff said about the ending.<br /><br />The Gotham Diaries is a character driven story of upper crust African American NY Society, and the skeletons buried in the designer closets.  You will find yourself entering the inner circle of friends comprised of Manny Marks, a real estate agent who will stop at nothing to climb the social ladder, Tandy Brooks, a widowed socialite who finds herself suddenly without the outrageous income she has become accustomed to, and Ed and Lauren Thomas, a billionaire businessman and his young trophy wife.<br /><br />The plot is simply friendships forged and lost, betrayal, greed, unfaithfulness, power, and above all the burning need to either climb the ladder or fend off your position at the top.  Money is power and image is everything, but what will be the final price for your soul?  Again, I must stress that you don't miss the ending, it is a stunning climax that will leave you laughing, cheering, and crying.<br /><br />What I really liked was the dimension given to the characters, as long as you keep reading.  Just when one side of a character is revealed, Lee and Anthony will turn the mirror over and show you what the other side looks like.  Once faced with these fully rounded characters, you begin to understand more of their motivations, and will either love or hate them.  The writing style is formatted as if you were just introduced to these people, and the more you hang out with them, the more you find out about them.<br /><br />A very nice, smooth read, Gotham Diaries is still rather short, only 262 pages, which makes it the perfect beach or vacation book, even though you may find yourself drooling for more.

Starting off with Stephen King's `Autopsy Room Four', a story that, believe it or not, I have never read of his.  An excellent view of what it is like for one man to almost become a corpse before his time, Robert Bloch's `Psychos' keeps up this pace with some stunningly unique and frightening tales of murder and mayhem.<br /><br />Charles Grant's `Haunted' turns the tables of a secretive killer and the strangely heroic form of a bum.<br /><br />Ed Gorman's `Out There In The Darkness' tells a tale of middle class vengeance against the dregs of society, a cult that takes care of their own.<br /><br />Brent Monahan's `Doctor, Lawyer, Kansas City Chief' takes us to the limits of where an angry man will go to track down drunk drivers.<br /><br />Del Stone Jr. writes `Lighting The Corpses, a tale of an ethereal madman who lights up fires of hopelessness.<br /><br />Clark Perry's `Deep Down There' will keep you out of caves for the rest of your life, and Gary Jonas's \\"So You Want To Be A Hitman' takes you on a road-rage ride with a true psychotic.<br /><br />My Favorites, along with `Autopsy Room Four', would be Lawrence Watt-Evans `Grandpa's Head', giving us a tiny glimpse of family history, Ester M. Friesner's `Loneyhearts' with lessons on how to stalk and find just the right mate for you, Edo van Belkom's `The Rug' gives sinister menace to an everyday item, and Gary A. Braunbeck's `Safe' is a chilling Columbine type tale of unexplainable madness.<br /><br />There are more tales of terror by Richard Christian Matheson, Denise M. Bruchman, Dominick Cancilla, Cindi Geddes, Yvonne Navarro, David Niall Wilson, Richard Parks, Stephen M. Rainey, Jane Yolen, and Billie Sue Mosiman.  Twenty-two tales in all, plus notes about the authors in the back.  The introduction was done by Horror Writer's Association, for even though Robert Bloch started this editing project, he sadly died before its completion, leaving behind a legacy of some of the best horror ever written.<br /><br />While some of the stories do not actually center around actual psychos, they all tend to leave that feeling of madness poised in the gray matter between your ears, threatening to sink deeper the longer you ponder these tales.  `Psychos' is a true masterpiece collected by Horror Writers Association, and a definite not-to-be-missed trip into the insanity we horror aficionados crave so much.

However, the age-old phrase \\"I just buy it for the articles\\" has long been as well deserved as their reputation for fleshy treats.<br /><br />Aside from foldouts and photo shoots, Playboy has consistently offered up some of the best journalism available, in their interviews, articles, and fiction contributions.  So when the Playboy publishers decide it is time to offer up, in book form, collections of the fictional material available from their magazine publication, it is well worth your while to sit up, take notice, and buy the book.<br /><br />In this 1998 collection, you will find such sci-fi treats as Ray Bradbury's `Lost City Of Mars', where you are taken by yacht through the Martian canals to an abandoned city, designed to deliver whatever you wish for.  Ursula K. LeGuin's `Nine Lives' takes a brand new look at cloning, and puts you inside one's mind.  Kurt Vonnegut's `Welcome To The Monkey House', is a wonderful story of a bizarre underground faction that is ready to buck the system of removing overpopulation.  Walter Tevis writes an ethereal and haunting love story in `The Apotheosis Of Myra', a tale of ever-waking and undying love.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick's `Frozen Journey', is about a long bout of consciousness during space travel, and a computer's efforts to stay off a human's insanity.  Joe Haldeman takes a personal and terrifyingly psychological look into the mind of a cyborg in `More Than The Sum Of His Parts', and there is even Stephen King's `The Word Processor', originally published long ago in his collection called The Skeleton Crew.<br /><br />These tantalizing teasers are just the beginning of Playboy's collection of twenty-five superb science fiction stories, some merely skirting the edges of possibility and some plunging right off the cliffs of sanity into the endless pool of imaginary fantasy and delusion.  With such authors as Arthur C. Clark, Frederick Pohl, Damon Knight, Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, Larry Niven, Chet Williamson, and even one short written by none other than Billy Crystal (yes, the comedian).<br /><br />I cut my teeth on Sci-Fi reading Playboy's 1966 collection of Science Fiction and Fantasy, still far superior to any other collection I have encountered, and after tasting such sweet science fiction, it was inevitable that I grow fonder of the genre as time passed.

Not only that, I felt the title was misleading because there were no hard sci-fi computer or world machine stories.  And the book started out weakly with a couple of ok stories.  But give it time, give it time.<br /><br />Like swimming in shallow water at first, you will find yourself suddenly plunging into some excellent tales, starting the warm up with The Burden Of Indigo and finishing with four more excellent stories, The City Never Sleeps is a surreal story of a man's life unfolding, Undercover brings in a very specialized robot on a galactic chase for a villain, The Beautiful Stranger is a haunting tale of a husbands decline into uselessness to his family, and Shadow Of The Mountain is a beautiful and strangely dreamlike look into a young soldier's past as he lay dying.<br /><br />If you are an anthology lover like I am, this is a worthwhile purchase for your collection.  If you are not sure, I strongly recommend checking it out from your local library.  I think you will find a pleasant surprise in this author's first collection of shorts.  Perfect book for travel or beach, or to keep in your pocket to peruse when waiting on appointments.  Enjoy!	2004-12-22

After coming across Luke Davies first novel, Candy, I couldn't wait for the appearance of his next book.  While Isabelle The Navigator lacks the powerfully compulsive magnetism of Candy, it is still nonetheless a work of art, displaying Davies's wonderfully poetic prose as he dives into the depths of grief.<br /><br />Isabelle had a wonderful childhood, brought abruptly to an end when her physician father Tom is arrested and sent to prison for Medicare fraud.  She also discovers that her mother had been having an on and off affair with her uncle Dan, Tom's brother.  Then her love of four years, Matt, is suddenly killed in a highway accident, which leaves Isabelle feeling as though she were an empty vessel.<br /><br />Davies probes the depths of Isabelle's grief with such rhythmical and flowing prose that her pain is intimately felt by the reader, capturing the intense and profound emotions like very few writers can do.  He begins by wading in the shallows of the initial loss of her father's love, as Tom drifts further and further into insanity after his release from prison, eventually plunging headlong into the icy and numbing depths of acute grief after Matt's death.<br /><br />With scenes that smoothly move back and forth in time, Isabelle tells us the story of her losses and her determination to bring meaning back into her life while coming to grips with her past.  From Davies homeland of Australia to the elegant charm of Paris to a brief visit to Hawaii, Isabelle finds that though her ghosts will always follow her, there is life after even the harshest of events strip away your intended future.<br /><br />Perfect read, wonderful and beautiful and uplifting even in its heartbreaking reality, Davies has written another winner with Isabelle The Navigator.  Don't forget to pick up a copy of Candy also.  Enjoy!	2004-12-22

This time Slung has dug up some treats from the past, from such authors as Arthur Conan Doyle, Charles Beaumont, Robert Aickman, T.H. White, and Mervyn Peake, combining their savory passions with such newer authors as Harlan Ellison, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, Lisa Tuttle, Nancy A. Collins, Sarah Smith, and Claudia O'Keefe.<br /><br />Beaumont's `The Crooked Man' I first read in my rare and treasured copy of the 1966 Playboy Book Of Sci-Fi And Fantasy, and its as juicy today as it was then.  Sarah Smith's `When The Red Storm Comes' is a superb vampire tale of the old school, Elizabeth Jane Howard's `Mr. Wrong' is a slowly creeping horror over a young girl's first automobile, and Claudia O'Keefe's `On The Lake Of Last Wishes' takes us into the vivid dreams of a dying young girl, and the fantasy she finds there.<br /><br />I enjoyed each tale in this collection, again with the exception of one I was lukewarm on, but the real treat is going to hit you straight out of the chute, with Nancy A. Collin's 'Aphra' being the first story in the book.  It's a grisly and knobby adventure with a man's infatuation with skeletons.  Superbly written and deviant enough to be delectable, I found it worth the price of the book alone.<br /><br />Slung's second collection, like her first, only skirts the edges of both eroticism and gore, but includes such haunting, well written tales that the flavor of the stories leaves a stinging aftertaste in your mouth that is not unpleasant at all.<br /><br />`Shudder Again' is a definite `Yes' to your collection of horror anthologies.

His books are rapidly paced romps through foreign countries and exciting situations, using likeable characters and unsavory villains.<br /><br />Are You Afraid Of The Dark is no exception, it is a typical Sheldon book in style, with fresh scenery and characters, not a deep and thought provoking work of art but rather a pleasant respite from our own mundane worlds.  Sheldon, like Stephen J. Cannell, uses his experience in screenplay writing to bring his novels alive, snapping and crackling with energy and tension.  The writing is simplistic to the point of almost the feeling of being talked down to, until you realize that what Sheldon is really doing here is good, old-fashioned storytelling.<br /><br />In Are You Afraid Of The Dark, the think-tank conglomerate, Kingsley International Group, is working on a project so secret that people are beginning to die from it.  Two of those who fall victim to KIG's beast-like power are Mark Harris and Richard Stevens, suspiciously dead just before a secretive trip to Washington DC.<br /><br />Their widows, Kelly Harris and Diane Stevens, happen to meet outside the offices of KIG where both had been summoned by KIG's corporate head, Tanner Kingsley.  After several close brushes on their own, the two women figure out together that somebody wants them dead, and will stop at nothing to obtain their goal.<br /><br />Making an unlikely team, these two anti-heroines put their heads together and manage to slip in and out of the traps set for them, using nothing more than their intuition and their minds, before finally deciding to take on Tanner himself and beat him at his own game.<br /><br />What I liked about these characters was that they were everyday women, no special talents like karate and no weapons at their disposal, and the way the two of them worked so well as a team when their personalities and backgrounds were quite different.<br /><br />There are no mysteries or hard-to-find clues in this novel, but the breakneck pace and quipping dialogue will have you finishing the book in no time at all.

His second novel, `High Life' is a tragic and poetic journey into the human soul.<br /><br />High Life is a story told by Jack, a guy who just wants to play the game by the rules and get ahead in the competitive world of Los Angeles, a man obsessed with the personalities he sees on the TV screen every day.  Jack is basically lonely, and winds out marrying a hooker named Karen, embarking on a two-year marriage that gets neither of them anywhere.  But there is comfort in having someone there at the end of the day, someone to look out for, and when Karen is brutally murdered, Jack's outlook on the world changes.  Only weeks before Karen's murder, Jack found out that she had sold one of her kidneys for thirty thousand dollars, and when her mutilated body is found, the scar had been removed.<br /><br />Jack no longer believes that working hard and obeying the rules will get anyone ahead, and embarks on a new career of hustling down in the seedy side of Hollywood.  He gets hooked up with his friend Rex, who introduces him to an escort agency, which caters to a finer, wealthier class of clients.  From here he meets Bella, an extremely wealthy woman with perverted tastes.  Bella takes an interest in Jack, and with her wealth and power gets him a spot on a Hollywood Gossip show, introducing him to the finer things and people he only dreamed about knowing.<br /><br />In the meantime, policeman Ted Ryan is hot on Jack's trail, not because he works homicide, but because he knew Jack's wife Karen in a professional way, having been a frequent client.  Ryan is not a good cop, perverted and psychotic, and he peruses Jack with relentless viciousness, even into the posh Malibu home of Bella and her father Powell, where the three become linked over Karen's death.<br /><br />High Life is not a pretty tale, there is not one redeemable character in it.  It is filled with drug abuse, prostitution, violent couplings, necrophilia, fecal stimulations, foul language, and operations that make medical malpractice look like tea parties.  It is brutal, ugly, violent, and unforgiving.  So why did I like it so much?<br /><br />Matthew Stokoe is a truly gifted writer, I felt every ounce of pain that Jack felt though Stokoe's vivid and animated prose.  His ability to project Jack's feelings of despair, isolation, yearning, and desperation is remarkable.  High Life is one of those books that, when I finished, I found it hard to pick up another book because I had been so involved in Jack's life that nothing else measured up.  There was just so much emotion in this story, desolation and bitterness and a hurtful longing for what society tells us we need to have and be to belong, that I was overcome with the same sensations that drove Jack to his deviant lifestyle choices.<br /><br />You had better have a strong stomach for the nastier scenes of sexual defecation and corpse manipulation, not to mention Bella's secret little fetish with fresh human organs, but if gross horror is your cup of tea, you absolutely must pick up High Life and give it a read.  I can't wait to see what Matthew Stokoe comes up with next.  Enjoy!!ouplings, necrophilia, fecal stimulations, foul language, and operations that make medical malpractice look like tea parties.

What separates him from the rest of the pack are the fantastical events he unfolds in his comedic tales.<br /><br />A great Sea Beast awakens from his slumber, feeling a bit randy and ready to emerge.  When he finds a tanker truck refueling at a gas station in Pine Cove, he mistakes its purring engines for a come-on signal from a female.  However, mounting a gas tanker may have dire consequences, and our Sea Beast is badly burned in the process.<br /><br />He makes his way to a nearby trailer park, where he alters his outward appearance to look like just another trailer while he heals from his tanker encounter.  He parks himself next to Molly Michon's trailer, an ex B-Movie queen with mental problems.  She is the only one who knows the trailer is alive, and promptly names him Steve.<br /><br />The town of Pine Cove is a small, usually quiet tourist town, until Bess Leander, seemingly the queen of domestic bliss, commits suicide.  Local psychiatrist Val Riordan blames herself for not paying enough attention to her clients, and promptly takes her entire patient list off of their antidepressants, while stoner constable Theophilius Crowe realizes there is something suspicious about Bess's death and decides to investigate despite the warnings of the county sheriff to just let it go.<br /><br />`Lust Lizard' is rich with colorful characters, fantastical delusions, a crusty bartender, some wonderful tie-in's to Moore's `Practical Demonkeeping', blues music, and a tasty peek into the mind of a lustful Sea Beast named Steve.  And when Steve's feelings of lust bleed out into the human population, feelings explode into passionate actions.  While through all of this, Theo must not only discover why everyone is behaving strangely, but what is behind the death of Bess Leander.<br /><br />One of the things I loved about `Lust Lizard' was Moore's addition of a character named Gabe Fenton, who is a scientist doing studies of the rat colonies around Pine Cove.  Some of the similarities between Gabe's rats and the human colonies that surround us are worthy of pondering, comparing the behavior of one species as a herd to our own was very tongue in cheek and yet hilarious once noted and accepted.<br /><br />All in all, The Lust Lizard Of Melancholy Cove is a very funny romp into the human mind and the antics of an ancient creature named Steve.  A worthwhile read.  Enjoy!on of a character named Gabe Fenton, who is a scientist doing studies of the rat colonies around Pine Cove.

Written in 1971, `Fear and Loathing' still has a powerful impact on the mind even today.  If you are easily offended by gratuitous drug usage and the craziness resulting from it, then put the book down and back away slowly.  For those who may have perhaps saw the movie with Johnny Depp and did not know what to think of it, I highly recommend reading the book and then watching the movie again, its subtleties come out from the background provided in the book, and you will truly appreciate the performances afterwards.<br /><br />`Fear' is absolutely hilarious, following the ramblings of a journalist and his attorney into Las Vegas in the early years.  Through clouds of mescaline, acid, ether, amyl, tequila, rum, and pot, we see Las Vegas through the demented eyes of a person totally over the edge and bordering on drug induced psychosis.<br /><br />The bar scene in Circus-Circus is worth the price of the book alone, and all of the vapid trippings of our dynamic duo are practically frightening in their intensity.  Thompson has captured the mind of the delusional manic in `Fear', and while it is a journey not recommended for real life, in its book form it is highly entertaining and brutally funny.<br /><br />Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas may be dated in its use of drugs and money, and the picture painted of a Las Vegas strip long gone to the commercialism of today's Vegas, but the amusing underlying story of human nature of the edge of reason is timeless.  Definitely a worthwhile muse to entertain yourself with.  Enjoy!	2004-11-15

He and his five wealthy buddies decide to take a `boys week off', in which the six of them will each invite a `trophy' woman to come along.  He plans an indulgent and sensual vacation for everyone.<br /><br />Thoros himself invites Justine Cousteau, an intelligent woman who is also a capable pilot, to assist him in flying his private plane from Oahu to Mora Utu.  Jase Schindler invites Liz Cavanaugh, from his publishing company, Tony Capuletti invites Tiffany Johnson, a PR director for a nationwide chain of gyms.  H. Douglas Rand invites his subordinate, Francesca Corbo (Chesi), the Project Coordinator for the Mora Utu designs, Jack Doherty invites Marika, a TV Commercial star with big aspirations of becoming a movie star, and Alex Barclay-Fontaine invites Christie Gibbs, a reporter.<br /><br />The men are super rich and powerful, the women are beautiful and intelligent, and it looks to be the vacation of a lifetime.  Until Tony rapes Marika, drawing a line in the sand between the men and the women.  The women become fearful, alone on an island where the men believe that money will pay off rape charges, and when Justine finds that the plane has been sabotaged, cutting off their escape, the group of women flees into the jungle.<br /><br />What ensues is a battle of the sexes, the men against the women, and Thoros's two servants, Emilio and Nelida are destined to guide them through the fates that await them.  Their games include sabotage, back-stabbing, pitting themselves against each other, and even love.  Somehow, they must all make it off the secluded island before the storms come.<br /><br />This is a great story, with well fleshed out characters and flowing prose.  The only reason I did not give it five stars was because I could not quite stomach the mystical part of the two servants, that seemed a little forced and over-the-top.  What I really did like was the humanity of the characters, the women's strength showing through in spite of their `bimbo' actions, and the men showing their own humanity through the `machismo' of their actions.<br /><br />Fantastic beach or airline read, this one is best savored when you are kicking back with a comfortable attitude and need a little diversion.

It is a tale of very taboo subjects, such as gays in the Priesthood, abortion rights, and Catholic doctrine.  If you are easily offended, back slowly away from this book and leave the room.<br /><br />Rest assured, Disch actually attacks none of these subjects, simply offers up a well-written piece of fiction with many muses intertwined with the tale.  Remember that it is a piece of fiction.<br /><br />Father Patrick Bryce is not a good man, having already been chastised by the Church for being caught abusing a young boy.  Father Bryce is a pedophile, and an unrepentant one, though he is back at work in Saint Bernardine church along with Father Cogling, a strictly old-fashioned Priest with an unkind heart.<br /><br />Above all, the church wants no scandals, and so when a man named Clay shows up with evidence of Father Bryce's sins, he submits to the blackmail rather than fight it.  But Clay doesn't want money, he wants Bryce to get a tattoo of the devil on his chest, and read a book called A Prolegomenon To Receptivist Science by cult leader A.D. Boscage, while Bishop Massey expects him to lead the controversial anti-abortion rallies for the sake of the Church.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we are introduced to Silvanus de Roquefort, the Bishop of Rodez in the small village of Montpellier-le-Vieux, back in the middle ages, around the thirteenth century.  Silvanus is a vain man, and devoted to the Church only insomuch as it benefits his station and well being.<br /><br />When Patrick and Silvanus begin to switch mind and body, in a process the cult leader Boscage calls \\"Transmentation\\", things really start to fly loose and fall apart.<br /><br />There are many other interesting characters interwoven into the plot, like Gerherdt Ober and his sister Hedwig, religious fanatics who run the Birth-Right Center where girls are locked in cells and forced to bear their children.  Bing Anker, a former victim of Father Bryce who stirs his friend Father Mabbley into action, and a young girl named Alison who gets caught up in the storm brewing at Birth-Right.<br /><br />The Priest is a complex novel, full of sin and degradation and mysticism, but what's waiting for you in the end is a plot twist of rare and satisfying dimensions, tucked neatly into a action packed race against time and some brutal revelations.

He visits his old friend Guido in Naples, who convinces him to take a low wage bodyguard job to occupy his time.  Becoming a bodyguard to eleven year old Pinta Balletto was at first difficult for Creasy in that he did not care to be around people.  But Pinta weaves her way into his cold heart and softens it.<br /><br />When Pinta is kidnapped and killed, and Creasy badly wounded in her protection, he realizes that Pinta had given him a new outlook on life, and he vows to kill everyone even remotely involved in her death, including taking on Italy's top mob boss, Cantarella.<br /><br />Unfortunately, here the book takes an emotional sidetrack that the movie thankfully left out.  Creasy travels to Gozo to recuperate his strength, staying with the family of Guido's dead wife, Julia.  He manages to become accepted in the close knit community, making friends and toning his body.<br /><br />Here we meet Nadia Schembri, Julia's sister, supposedly written to appear tragic but coming off as pushy and self-centered to me.  Unfortunately, she becomes a love interest to Creasy, a very bad sidetrack in the plot.  I'm sorry, but a bad first marriage doesn't give her the right to use and deceive someone else.  I didn't like her at all.<br /><br />All the revenge and killing praised about in Man On Fire doesn't even begin until page 257 of a 370 page book.  While 256 pages were dedicated to Creasy's meeting with Pinta and recovery after the kidnapping, the book still did not divulge as much information on his character as the 2004 movie did.<br /><br />Ok, I saw the 2004 movie before I read the book, and since the book is almost *always* better than the movie, my expectations for this book were set pretty high.<br /><br />The Creasy in the movie is much colder, meaner, and more brutal than the book portrayed, the characters more well rounded (and Nadia completely left out, thank god) and more time is spent on the details of the kidnapping and revenge than the book.<br /><br />Overall, the book was OK, but not spectacular.  There was not as much action as I anticipated, and I found the softer Creasy to be less likeable than the movie's more hardened version.  Pinta's part in the book was shallow, and I felt I didn't get to know the girl well enough to love her like Creasy did.  If you have seen the movie, take note that the book is very different.  If you haven't seen the movie, you may enjoy the book more, but be cautioned that it is not the \\"non-stop action thriller\\" that is promised.portrayed, the characters more well rounded (and Nadia completely left out, thank god) and more time is spent on the details of the kidnapping and revenge than the book. <br /> <br />Overall, the book was OK, but not spectacular.

I love tales of pestilence and despair, and Ms. Benson has written a compelling, cannot-put-it-down tale that flows smoothly over a 600 year time span.  Combining medieval with future-modern is no easy task, but in Plague Tales the transition is smooth and tightly associated, leading to an amazing story of the Black Plague unleashed in two separate eras.<br /><br />In the thirteenth century, a young Jewish physician with a burning desire to better medical treatments is caught and imprisoned for exhuming a corpse to perform a post mortem exam on it.  With the aid of his father, Alejandro Canches is released from prison but branded on his chest as a Jew.  He cuts his traditional Jewish curls in order to hide himself as a Christian, and makes for Avignon to start a new life.<br /><br />On the way, he and his Spaniard companion Hernandez encounter many victims of bubonic plague, which is sweeping the countryside.  Once in Avignon, Hernandez succumbs to the deadly disease and leaves Alejandro alone.  In a remarkable twist of fate, Alejandro is summoned by the Pope's personal physician and sent to protect the family of King Edward III from the plague.<br /><br />While isolating the royal family in order to keep the plague outside the castle, Alejandro falls in love with the beautiful Lady Adele, companion to the mean-spirited Princess Isabella.  He becomes fast friends with little Kate, the King's bastard daughter, and manages with the help of the mysterious Mother Sarah to save Kate when she falls victim to the scourge.<br /><br />Alejandro rises to great favor in King Edward's court, but how far can a simple physician go, whose entire background is based on lies?<br /><br />Interwoven with Alejandro's intriguing tale is that of modern day Janie Crowe.  In the year 2005, after the great Outbreak, surgeons are no longer in demand, so the US Government is retraining them to other suitable occupations, Janie's new job being forensic archeology.  At forty-five, Janie is starting over after loosing her entire family to the Outbreak, and finds herself heading for England to collect soil samples to complete her thesis.<br /><br />International travel is heavily restricted, and she must go through intense scrutiny before being allowed into the country.  At the labs where she will be processing her samples, she discovers an old schoolmate from medical college, Bruce Ransom, has been working and living in England for eighteen years.<br /><br />Janie and her assistant Caroline have to sneak onto one of the selected properties for their samples, property belonging to Robert Sarin, last in a long line of \\"watchers\\", and in possession of a mystical book.  It is this soil sample that a strange microbe is discovered, and subsequently mishandled, unleashing the plague into modern day London.  And only the simple-minded Sarin holds the key between past and present.<br /><br />Well written and formatted, I liked Alejandro's tale better than Janie's, but Janie's tale had a surprising twist at the end that touched me.  This is a not to be missed story of pestilence, intrigue, mystery, mysticism, love, greed, and human nature.  I highly recommend The Plague Tales, and I can't wait to get my hands on more of Benson's work.  Enjoy!Janie's new job being forensic archeology.

Dr. Petrie immediately rushes the boy to the hospital, but its already too late.  Within only four days, the State of Florida is quarantined and millions are dying from a mutated bacilli that washed up on their shoreline, some within only twelve hours of exposure.<br /><br />Dr. Petrie, his nineteen year old girlfriend Adelaide Murry, and little daughter Pricilla (Prickles) manage to get past the roadblocks, only to discover that the plague has flown on before them.  They decide to head for Manhattan, which they heard was sealed off as a clean zone.<br /><br />In New York, we meet Ivor Glantz, acclaimed research biologist and his lovely step-daughter Esmeralda, aging movie actor Herbert Gaines and his young lover Nicholas, Kenneth Garunisch, president of the Medical Workers Union, and Edgar Paston, an average shop-owner plagued with delinquents ruining his store.<br /><br />Dr. Petrie manages to find his way to Ivor's incredible New York apartment in the exclusive Concorde Towers, where he convinces Ivor to work on a way to slow the plague, while Herbert Gaines is blackmailed into making public racial announcements placing blame for the plague on the black and Hispanic communities.<br /><br />Kenneth puts his workers on strike and escalates the downfall of civilization, while Edgar strikes up an unusual alliance with the leader of the delinquent gang to get himself out of Jersey.<br /><br />From the first page on, you won't be able to put this book down.  If you love disaster books like I do, you should scrounge up a copy of this one.  And if you like rats...well, you will love the furry parade coming out to greet you and say hello with their sharp little teeth.<br /><br />Incredible pace and juicy subplots make Masterton's \\"Plague\\" a winner, with a tiny lesson thrown in about dangerous polluters and having an \\"I don't care\\" attitude.

There are two things I really love about Nicholson's books, his characters and his Appalachian settings.  I found The Manor to be as fast a read as both The Harvest and The Red Church were, well paced and suspenseful using fully fleshed out characters and lush settings.<br /><br />I felt like I knew Anna and Mason and the artiste-de-general of the Manor's guests, I felt dizzy at the crossing of the bridge and I could smell the loamy woods surrounding the manor.  So now gather round this setting with these people, and get ready for a frightening ride.<br /><br />A group of artists are invited to the mountain retreat of Korban Manor, an isolated and rustic place with no electricity, to practice their crafts and attend a party the night of the October blue moon.<br /><br />Among the painters and sculptors and photographers and writers, Anna seems a bit out of place, being a paranormal researcher, invited to Korban Manor to hunt ghosts.  Or was she summoned?  Anna has the gift of second sight, and an unusual attachment to the strange house.<br /><br />Mason is a sculptor, trying to make his break, and when he gets to Korban Manor his talent seems to explode, his hands flying over the wood as he carves out an image of Ephram Korban.<br /><br />Everybody's talent has taken off, underneath the watchful stare of the portraits that hang in every room of the house and under the withering heat of the constantly lit furnace.  Something isn't right here, and the line between the living and the dead is growing thinner and thinner as the blue moon approaches.  The guests grow uneasy and suffer from horrid nightmares, and the staff just keeps getting odder and odder.  The dead are awake.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away because Nicholson has a few lovely surprises in store for his readers, having created an old fashioned ghost story with some eerie new twists that sent shivers of delight running down my spine.  Using just the right mix of creeping fear and bloody splatters, The Manor is a fast-paced, delightful read that is best savored in the lonesome hours under dim lighting.<br /><br />Enjoy!!bloody splatters, The Manor is a fast-paced, delightful read that is best savored in the lonesome hours under dim lighting.   <br />Enjoy!! <br /> <br />	2004-10-25

Why?  Because the short story fits so nicely into the crevices of my brain that need topping off in between waits at dentist offices and or that fifteen minute break.<br /><br />Shirley has compiled a mess of colorful and shivering muses here in Black Butterflies, a definite must-have addition to your anthology collection.<br /><br />Divided into two basic groupings, This World and That World, Shirley separates the more gritty, here-and-now stories (This World) from the more ethereal and imaginative stories (That World).  If I looked at them as a whole, I would say I liked That World collection better, having a more modern, cyberpunk edge to it, but there are jewels in both worlds worth drawing your tongue across to savor their flavors.<br /><br />Too many stories in all to mention, a few of my favorites would be these:  \\"Barbara\\", about a robbery victim who turns the tides her way to gain her own revenge.  \\"You Hear What Buddy And Ray Did\\", a brutal but remarkably silly story of drugs, a crazy drag queen, and robbery gone wrong.  \\"What Would You Do For Love\\", a crazy romp with a real redneck bimbo and the level headed rescuer.  \\"Delia And The Dinner Party\\", the best imaginary rabbit ever penned onto paper.  \\"Pearldoll\\", hmmmm, zombie-ism or just plain old absorption?  \\"How Deep The Taste Of Love\\", a sickening, alien type, cannibal type, gore fest not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Shirley is talented with words, and is able to take a queasy tale of squishy, nasty things and inject just enough humor into it to make it go down sweet.  His characters are never flat and horror in his tales range from mild shivers to a couple of downright convulsions.<br /><br />Not as gory as Edward Lee, nor as creepy as Conrad Williams or Brian Lumley, Shirley still holds a firm footing that slides down that edge of insanity that us horror aficionados tend to travel nightly, whistling happy tunes as we read of death and destruction, despair and grief.  Ah.  Great Collection.  I highly recommend it.  Enjoy!and grief.  Ah.  Great Collection.  I highly recommend it.  Enjoy! <br />	2004-10-18

Yummy.<br /><br />A Mother sees her ten year old son for the monster he is, a mysterious empty box that leaves death in its wake, parrots and body-painting in a haunted bar, the unbreakable melding of minds with twins, a dying author's last wish, new methods of gentlemen's justice, just to skim a few teasers.<br /><br />Of special mention are the tales \\"Meagan's Law\\", a horrifying look at a real life monster that twists your views around; \\"The Great San Diego Sleazy Bimbo Massacre\\", a brutal and hilarious tale of two barflys and an unwanted husband; \\"The Rose\\", in which a tattoo artist frees a slave; and \\"Lines: Or Like Franco, Is Elvis Still Dead\\", a realistically scary tale of Fatal Attraction.<br /><br />Ketchum has proven in this collection that he not only writes well, but can cross whatever genre he chooses successfully.  Wild, weird, wonderful, horrific, and even inspiring, this is a must-have for you anthology collection.<br /><br />Includes Introduction and Afterward by Jack Ketchum, both factually interesting enough to take note of.

Her best friend Evie Cottrell steals all her clothing while she is in the hospital, and her fianc&eacute; Manus Kelley leaves her; but during her speech therapy classes she meets the enigma that is Brandy Alexander.<br /><br />Brandy befriends Shannon, and together with friend Seth Thomas they set off on a wild cross country tour, viewing high end estates up for sale and stealing all of the prescription drugs from them.  But believe me when I say, nothing is as it seems in this crazy story.  You are in for several very big surprises.<br /><br />Invisible Monsters is a book that is not about the plot, it is about the characters, and yet there are twists upon twists upon twists every turn of the page.  Who is Brandy Alexander?  Who is Shannon McFarland?  Who is Seth Thomas?  And who is Evie Cottrell?  You'll just have to keep reading.  Like me, you will probably wind out not caring about any of them, but they are going to make you laugh out loud with their outrageous plans and antics.<br /><br />You'll have tears running down your face when Shannon's parents (in a flashback scene before her disfigurement) give her nothing but condoms for Christmas because her brother died of AIDS.  And the conversation around the Thanksgiving table turns to graphic depictions of hinder romping while they cower in unnecessary fear because they support AIDS families.  Be thankful these are not your parents.<br /><br />Told oddly in a profusion of scene jumping, using the written word like flash photography, Palahniuk has written a psychotically offbeat tale that nonetheless will have you turning pages as rapidly as Brandy pops vicodin and estrogen.  I found it strangely enjoyable and morbidly compelling, and if you like screwy and disgusting stories, you will most likely love Invisible Monsters.

In Silent Graves deserves a Wow.<br /><br />Robert Londrigran is an up and coming local TV newscaster, well on his way up the ladder, with a beautiful and pregnant wife at home.  Then, his world crumbles.  After a spat on Halloween evening, Londrigan goes for a walk in the park and meets a piece of his destiny wearing a mask of horror.  When he returns home, he finds his wife crumpled on the floor, dying.<br /><br />Not only does Robert loose the wife he loved so much, but his daughter's body is taken from the morgue.  Braunbeck captured the dark torture of loss so well in his telling of Robert's grief that I was simply mesmerized.<br /><br />Even at the start of Robert's journey of anguishing loss, his reality begins to slide as he is re-visited by the strange masked figure from the park.  Something is happening to Robert, either he is going mad or he is transcending to a different state of awareness and being.  Robert must open his heart, his mind, and his soul before he can see the truth of what his life is, and what it can become if he only believes.<br /><br />In Silent Graves is part fantasy, part horror, part love, part tragedy, part inspirational, and part brutal reality.  The story is fantastical, the content weeping with the brutality of the human race, and the prose graphically poetic.  Quite frankly, I've never read anything like it; this is truly a unique and terrific book.<br /><br />A bit of warning for those who are faint of heart, there are scenes of corpse manipulation here that could churn your stomach if you are not used to such grotesqueries; but I myself found the horror of real life child abuse scraping my soul far emptier than a little putrefying flesh could.<br /><br />This is a graphically painted tale, with overwhelming sorrow and unbearably beautiful love, stylishly written in flowing prose that kept me awake and reading long after bedtime.<br /><br />I could ramble and praise much longer, but will instead close with this; if you purchase one book this year, you should purchase In Silent Graves.  I loved it that much.  Enjoy!l instead close with this; if you purchase one book this year, you should purchase In Silent Graves.  I loved it that much.  Enjoy! <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-21
US	52859935	R3NLHGSCV3PZ36	0375713344	890882757	Geek Love: A Novel	Books	5	151	168	N	Y	Beastly portrayal of physical deformity & mental oppression	It was Douglas E. Winter who said, \\"Horror is not a genre, it is an emotion.\\"  With that bold and all-too-true statement ringing in your ears, I will tell you that \\"Geek Love\\" is a horror story.  The protagonists are not simply trapped by their physical deformities, but also by their own familial love and the malevolent manipulation from one who is of them.<br /><br />The majority of the story is told by Olympia Binewski, born into a carnival family of intentional freaks.  Al and \\"Crystal Lil\\" Binewski set about starting their family with one intention; additions to the carnival's attractions.  Lily takes illegal drugs, insecticides, and even radioisotopes in order to purposefully \\"give their children the gift of making money just by being themselves.\\"  In other words, they create a family of horribly deformed children, their own freak show.<br /><br />Arturo, known as Aqua Boy, is the first of their children to survive.  He is a torso with flippers for arms and legs.  Second born are the Siamese twins Electra and Iphigenia, two perfect torsos rising up from one set of hips and legs, stunningly beautiful despite their deformity.  Olympia herself is the third living child, a hunchback albino dwarf, she is considered to be too commonplace to be useful but is kept anyway.  The youngest child, Fortunato, called Chick, was almost left on a doorstep for being normal when his telekinetic powers were discovered.  Kept in what was called \\"The Chute\\", in glass display jars, were the children of Al and Lily that did not live, yet kept as attractions in the Binewski Fabulon Carnival.<br /><br />Dunn's tale of quiet, creeping horror takes place in two separate time frames, Olympia's childhood with the carnival and a present day encounter with the daughter who doesn't know her.  The \\"present-day\\" storyline is a bit weak, stilted and practically unfeeling in its telling, but Olympia's childhood with the Fabulon is wrought with deeply impacting emotions of fear, hate, bitterness, happiness...and love.<br /><br />From the quietly acquiescing Olympia to the independence of the twins to the narcissistic brutality of Arturo, and the gentle genius of Chick, you love and hate the Binewski's as you find yourself completely engulfed in their strange world.  Arturo performs in a fish tank, and the twins take piano and singing lessons to entertain the crowds, while Olympia basically becomes a slave to her brother Arturo.<br /><br />But Arturo is not satisfied simply swimming in a tank, and with the help of an underwater sound device and his very own gift of speech, begins to mesmerize the crowds and forms a cult around himself.  A deadly cult of self-mutilation and butchery that called themselves Arturans rises up to follow the Aqua Boy, including a questionable physician called Dr. Phyllis, who joined the carnival after performing abdominal surgery on herself in her dorm room.<br /><br />You will meet Horst, the cat man and his tigers; Zephir McGurk, who tries to sell Arturo a strange device and winds out joining the Arturans; Norval Sanderson, a reporter who exposes Arturo's cult and then joins the carnival to sell maggots; Vern Bogner, a madman who eventually becomes \\"The Bag Man\\"; and the numerous Redheads who tends the carnival's food and game stands.<br /><br />From languid childhood afternoons to horrifying parking lot murderers, from close-knit family story times to vicious sibling rivalry, Geek Love is anything but dull or boring.  Innocence at the beginning, trepidation in the middle, heartbreak at the end, all stirred in with the tendrils of horror that creep from the pages and bite unexpectedly, Dunn has managed to puncture my mind and my flesh with this expertly crafted story.<br /><br />Powerful, heartbreaking, maddening, frustrating, sickening, fascinating, repugnant and yet alluring, Geek Love is a tightly written masterpiece of finding beauty in sewers, and putrescence in that which glitters.  Any book that stirs my love/hate passionsas deeply as Geek Love deserves to receive my highest recommendation.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.

US	52859935	RCCMZGC64KZF2	0060929499	356393047	There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road but Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos: A Work of Political Subversion	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Good grief!  Don't let morality interfere with profiteering!	Nobody is safe from the sharpened teeth and wit of this political watchdog, but we wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />Though \\"Armadillos\\" is an older book, published in 1997, it is still valid today.  And those of you who think he's swinging too hard at Pres. Bush will enjoy watching his energy focused on Clinton, who was Pres then.<br /><br />This is what I mean when I say Jim Hightower is not necessarily anti-Bush; he is anti corporateering and pro working-citizens.  He will aim his sights at anyone, regardless of partisan politics, and expose their greedy, pork-filled underbellies.<br /><br />\\"Armadillos\\" is divided into five basic sections; Class War, The Media, Pollution, and Politics.<br /><br />In Corporateworld, Hightower exposes such big-money deceptions as Corporatized Medicine.  While we sit back and debate whether or not socialized medicine is a worthwhile route, the HMO's and Corporations have taken over our health care to line their own pockets and serve no one but themselves.  Also note his timeline comparisons to the old Robber Barons, and the similarities of today's working place.  And watch out NAFTA, Hightower is on to you!<br /><br />In Class War, Hightower emphasizes the growing chasm between the filthy rich and the working-class right here in America.  Fortunately, anything this top heavy must eventually topple over, especially when their supporting base becomes unstable. (translate to unhappy and no longer willing to hold them up)  Of particular note in this chapter is Hightower's revisiting the origins of our holiday, Labor Day; by itself this makes the chapter Class War shine.<br /><br />In The Media, Hightower exposes the media bias long before \\"Out-foxed\\" was ever made.  Anyone remember the 1994 \\"Telecommunications Deregulation\\" bill that was supposed to create more competition in the telephone and cable choices we everyday citizens have?  How many choices do you have now?  If you are like me, there is One Mega-Monster provider that services your area and that is that.  I still have no choice and I'm paying 10 times what I used to.<br /><br />Pollution is the best chapter in the book.  Here, Hightower charges in, no holes barred, and shows up the corporate greed, incompetent government agencies, and fat-belly back scratchings that are keeping this country polluted and compromising our health everyday.  From meat-packing to organochlorines, no polluter is safe.  I have recently read a very disturbing book called \\"Slaughterhouse\\" by Gail Eisnitz, and here in \\"Armadillos\\" Hightower proves that what Ms. Eisnitz exposed has been going on for a very long time.<br /><br />Taking a huge risk here, Hightower even stands up against the \\"feel good\\" events such as the National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  How dare he attack such a noble and gentle association?  Because the sole funding source of BCAM is Zeneca Group, a huge multibillion-dollar corporation named in a 1990 lawsuit for dumping DDT and PCB's into Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors.  What, you say?  Zeneca produces cancer causing, chlorine based pesticides, most of which are dumped into our environment, then has the nerve to tell us women that its our \\"fatty diets\\" or our \\"lifestyles\\" causing our illnesses.  To put icing on top of this putrescent cake, Zeneca also owns a pharmaceutical company that produces a treatment drug for breast cancer.  Give it to `em, then charge `em to try and cure it.<br /><br />During the next BCAM campaign, watch to see if any mention is made to organochlorines and their links to cancer.  You won't find any.<br /><br />The last chapter, Politics, sounds more volatile but is actually a gentle sliding out of the book.  Making more and more sense, Hightower warns us that instead of being so partisan, we need to question the ethics of each and every candidate, especially where their monetary interests are.<br /><br />\\"Armadillos\\" is still in tune with the problems of this country, and what I really like about him is that he points out ways for the reader to fight back, so you are not left all riled up with no comb in your hand.<br /><br />His humor is both sharp and refreshing, and he infuses it heavily into his written works, making palatable even the most horrible of subjects.  One of my favorite ideas of his is the Candidate Stickers; just like racecar drivers wear patches and stickers showing their sponsors, so should our politicians.  Hightower paints a very funny picture of a debate with sticker-covered candidates, the only part that is not so funny is that while we argue party against party, the candidates are wearing the same corporate logos on their 1K suits.<br /><br />Hightower uses extensive reference to real occurances here, naming bills and corporations, providing dates, and showcasing the organizations that are making a difference.  This is a great book for those just becoming politically aware, and for old veterans of the partisan wars alike.  Hightower's witty prose and down-home humor actually make politics a fun read.

Unfortunately, it barely earned two stars.<br /><br />There are so many hideous monstrosities that could have boiled out of this teeming vat of inspiration, but it's almost as if the authors didn't know what they were doing.  Seriously.<br /><br />Out of nineteen stories, only four are worth mentioning, and these four are the sole reason HP gets two stars instead of one.<br /><br />Piecework by James Lovegrove<br /><br />Guinea Pig A by Chris Poote<br /><br />Bits and Pieces by Ian Darby<br /><br />Going Gently by Tim Lebbon<br /><br />The premise was a Frankenstein type motif; a \\"what if\\" scenario of creating life artificially, and placing these literary meanderings into a collection.  Only the four authors above took any liberty to create a unique vision of resurrection and reanimation, adding in that special spice of putrescence and revolting flesh.<br /><br />The rest?  Well, they all seemed to be under the impression they were required to combine the actual *era* of Frankenstein with technology advanced enough to reanimate a corpse, and what came out was gibberish.<br /><br />Some of the stories just plain don't make any sense, others are written in choppy and clunky styles, making reading difficult and left my attention span flying out the window towards the toads in the yard.<br /><br />I'm actually sorry I didn't like this collection any better than I did; RazorBlade Press made a beautiful cover and used a very eye-pleasing font, but in the end it just didn't cut the mustard as far as usable content.  Save your money, and leave this on the shelf.	2004-09-14

There are seventeen stories in all, too many to cover each one, but here is a quick summary of my favorites:<br /><br />City In Aspic - a haunting and misty tale of a hotelkeeper in Venice, and the horrors that haunt him through the city's winter streets.<br /><br />The Windmill - A vacation in Norfolk will be the beginning or the end of Claire's relationship.<br /><br />Wire - A boy remembers his mother, and the dark terror that stalked her when he was young.<br /><br />Edge - Another vacation gone awry, and love that turns bitter and violent.<br /><br />The Owl - A young man and his expecting wife move into an old house in the country, and a storm comes that changes everything.<br /><br />The Suicide Pit - In streets filled with \\"little samples and smears of humanity that won't erase\\", a lonely man finds his destiny.<br /><br />Nearly People - (the longest and best of the stories)  Eerily futuristic look at a quarantined area of a city, where Carrier stalks food for Jake, and meets the Dancer.

Mama instead offers Pedro Tita's sister Rosaura, so Pedro marries Rosaura just so he can remain near Tita.<br /><br />Tita's skills in the kitchen overflow into fantastical proportions; the wedding cake she bakes for her sister's wedding contained her tears as she prepared it, leaving everyone who eats it filled with a longing so poignant they become physically ill.  And Tita's Quail In Rose Petal Sauce so potent with her desire for Pedro that it infects her sister Gertrudis, who runs off naked from the house to be swept up by a soldier on horseback and carried away.<br /><br />At the beginning of each chapter is a month in which the story takes place, and a recipe that Tita will prepare.  This makes the tale both fun and intriguing, and leaves you wondering what kind of passion Tita will stir up next, and who it will be served to.  You will be turning pages rapidly, waiting for the tale's conclusion, and wondering if Tita will ever escape the iron hand of Mama Elena and find an outlet for all of her pent up desires.<br /><br />This is an extremely well written book, a wonderful tale of unbridled passion, and appetites that go beyond the norm.

When on honeymoon in 1928, Tom and Kate List are in a motor car accident that leaves Kate with a broken hip.  Not knowing she was already pregnant, she receives a turn-of-the-century x-ray during treatment.  Nine months later, her daughter Jennifer is born.<br /><br />Jennifer is different from all the other children, in an indefinable way.

Starting with an incident of a broken vase when she was but a child, strange things happen around Jennifer when she is upset or cornered.<br /><br />Her only friend is Ellen Compton, a beauty who is so self centered she has no room to fear what Jennifer is; and her husband Dr. William Gilbert is a kind and quiet man who does not notice much around him.  Even in the presence of the only two people who have ever tolerated her, Jennifer is alone.<br /><br />The book skips around from Jennifer's past to her present, when maniac killer Amos Roberts is found dead in the Gilbert's apartment.  Assigned to the case is Captain David Stavitsky, a homicide cop obsessed with a case folder of criminals who escaped prosecution.

McCammon is an awesome author, usually tending more towards the traditional monsters, vampires, dead things, ghostly apparitions, and downright evil incarnations; but in `Mine', he has taken on the human monster and painted her with such ferocity that you are left wishing for something fanged and green under your bed.<br /><br />Mary Terrell is an overweight and aging hippie, unstable and unable to let go of her past.  Not the gentle past of flowers and peace and love, but of her persona as Mary Terror, member of the radical and violent Storm Front Brigade led by her old lover, Jack Gardiner, once known as Lord Jack.<br /><br />Lost in the past and still dropping acid, Mary's last shred of sanity snaps when she kidnaps a baby from the hospital to take to Lord Jack, to replace the baby that was killed twenty years ago when the Storm Front was captured and disbanded.<br /><br />The baby Mary kidnaps is tiny David Clayborne, newborn to Laura and Doug Clayborne.  Just before her delivery, Laura discovers Doug is having an affair, ripping apart her perfect life of happily-ever-after in the suburbs with a BMW.<br /><br />Laura is beyond desperate when David is discovered missing, and spurred into taking action on her own when the police drag their feet and Doug responds with inept mannerisms and hollow faith in the police.<br /><br />With only her journalist's background to rely on, Laura leaves the hospital to track down Mary Terror, still weakened from childbirth but determined to get her baby back before Mary inadvertently kills him.<br /><br />What we are left with is a fingernail-biting chase across three thousand miles, with close calls and near misses and horrific anxiety at every turn.  `Mine' literally took my breath away, it was so gripping and tense, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />WARNING!!  First chapter spoiler for the weak of heart.  There is a horrifying scene in the first chapter portraying Mary's sickness, in which she tortures a baby.  Relax, it's really a doll, but I almost threw the book down because of it.  Keep going, the book is well worth the read.here is a horrifying scene in the first chapter portraying Mary's sickness, in which she tortures a baby.

From new cars to new appliances to new clothing, it is the goal of Marketing to make us feel less than zero if we do not obtain these all-important items.  It's funny how the phrase \\"Keeping Up With The Jones's\\" appeared right around the time of Television, when the Marketing industry realized they could reach right into our very living rooms and tickle our \\"Gotta-Have-It\\" bone.<br /><br />Never have corporations been richer or greedier, and never has the emotional health of our nation been poorer.  We work harder and longer for less and less pay while striving to find happiness in an empty purchase.  And the busier we become, the less time we take to stop and realize we are working ourselves to death for things We Don't Need.<br /><br />Affluenza points out the many scars this condition has left on America, from overflowing landfills and polluted waterways to the breakdown of our moral values and even obesity.  And yes, the authors do tie this all in together very well.<br /><br />What I didn't like about Affluenza was that it lost steam about halfway through.  After setting off the sirens in my head about this condition, it offered little or no real solution.  Not once in the book do the authors even tell us \\"Turn off your TV\\", much less \\"Throw it out\\".  It was rather like being spanked and then told to go take a bath and forget about it.<br /><br />The solutions were \\"large\\", like reducing work hours in America, which we all know needs to be done, but the authors leave it there.  They don't talk about how \\"average Joe\\" is to go about fixing this problem, like writing to their legislatures or specific organizations to get in touch with.<br /><br />All in all, Affluenza is a good Wake-Up book, but needed to spend more effort on what we can do to inoculate ourselves from this \\"consumptive\\" disease.

First of all, I am a huge StarDoc fan, so when I first started reading Bio Rescue I felt a little let down.  Don't let that feeling stop you from finishing Bio Rescue.  I had to take some time to adjust to the POV of a new species, but once I did that, I flew through the book and wound out enjoying it immensely.<br /><br />Jadaira is a `Zangian, an aquatic species that lives in the vast oceans on the plant nicknamed K-2 (StarDoc fans will remember this planet), who was genetically altered after her birth in order to save her life.  But because the Pod rejects deformed pups, Dr. Teresa Selmar used human DNA in order to save Jadaira as a pup when Jadaira's `Zangian mother died.  So Jadaira is different from the rest of her Pod.<br /><br />She is also a very skilled Pilot, and along with her fellow SEAL's, (Surgically Enhanced/Altered Life-Form) agrees to become part of the new Bio-Rescue program launched by Dr. William Mayer and Administrator Ana Hansen.  Jadaira shows off her skills as a pilot right off the bat when she saves a transport full of Skartesh, a wolf-like race with bizarre habits that make them disliked by most other species.<br /><br />In spite of their differences Jadaira befriends the leader of the Skartesh, Rushan Amariah, unwittingly stirring up the jealously of her second-in-command, Lieutenant Onkar.  Viehl paints Onkar so typically male in this story that even though he is a `Zangian like Jadaira, you couldn't help but love his masculinity and disdain his arrogance.<br /><br />Jadaira has her hands full with leading the Bio Rescue unit, teaching the Skartesh to be more accepting of other races, trying to pacify her human mother Teresa, and doing all she can to dodge the insistent Onkar.<br /><br />Bio Rescue has a fast paced storyline with an incredible ending, so tuck away your StarDoc novels for now and give Jadaira and the `Zangians a whirl.

And Hightower's sharp sense of humor combined with his down-to-earth writing style make this a quick and rousing read.<br /><br />No matter what your political influence is, this is a book that, IMHO, every concerned citizen should read.  The issues brought up affect all of us in the long run, and the best part of \\"Thieves\\" is the list of resources at the end in case you get fired up enough to do something about it.<br /><br />Just because the internet moves at the speed of light does not mean that man was created to do the same, and we need to slow down so we can smell the foul and ripened odor of the corporate greed that surrounds us.  While over 80 percent of Americans are working longer hours for less money, the average CEO salary has gone from 40 percent more than the working-class (1981) to 400 percent of the working-class (2003).  And they are the ones getting all the tax cuts and government assistance while screaming \\"Poverty\\".<br /><br />\\"Thieves\\" is packed with many, many more shocking facts like the one above, from taxes and revised environmental standards to campaign funding to government subsidies for billionaires (page 23); Hightower has pulled all the punches and laid their grubby fingers out on the table for us to take a cold, hard, factual look at.<br /><br />In the book, Hightower does make heavy use of references for his sources, but I would have liked to seen a Bibliography too, which would probably be my only complaint about the book.  However, if you are concerned that corporations are gaining too much power, or can't find a manufacturing job in the USA, or recently had your high-tech job leave US soil for a third world country to do your job at one-quarter your wage and line the pocket of that CEO, pick up a copy of \\"Thieves\\" and read.

US	52859935	R3RGJE838ZFP8K	1568582293	482914337	Frenzetta	Books	1	1	2	N	Y	Spectacularly tasty plot falls victim to poor craftsmansip	I was so anxious to receive this book and read it, just my cup of tea!  A reanimated corpse in love with a rat-queen who can't get enough bedtime favors, who leave a trail of destruction in their wake.  Wow.<br /><br />Now the reality check.  What sounds like a spectacular idea and a great story is utterly ruined by a first person POV that is so randomly and haphazardly told that it is not only hard to follow but unfathomably boring.  There seems to be not a fragment of straightforwardness in Calder's prose, though he also misses out on the poetry of surrealism.<br /><br />Only 190 pages, it still took me a couple of weeks to labor through Frenzetta, and for all that I was still left un-rewarded with any type of conclusion satisfactory enough to warrant the time I spend tediously wading through paragraphs of random images to find one small sentence that moved the fragmented storyline further towards its finish.<br /><br />This is not lyricism; it's more like listening to someone with schizophrenia or dementia describe a dream to you, that someone else had.  Whew.  Save your money and pick up Edward Lee if you want gross, or China Mieville if you want lyricism.	2004-08-18

This is a book about corporate greed and government ineffectiveness, and how absolutely everyone in the room refuses to see the Pink Elephant at the table, stuffing itself at the expense of your health and hard earned money.<br /><br />Pay Attention!  Virtually every piece of meat you purchase from your supermarket with the \\"USDA Inspected\\" safety stamp on it HAS NEVER BEEN INSPECTED AT ALL.  USDA inspectors are no longer responsible for \\"Contamination Control\\", which amounts to debris coating the carcass such as feces, urine, mucus, pus, hair, dirt, grease, rat droppings, blood clots, etc.  Their only responsibility is to examine the organs and head for gross malformations, and the inspectors are severely reprimanded or even fired for stopping the line, so virtually every filthy and disease ridden corpse makes its way to your table anyway.<br /><br />A) Taking the butchering of animals away from the smaller, pride-of-ownership slaughterhouses and moving virtually all of the animal product production to high-speed, high profit corporations was a deadly move, and it is up to the working-class people to stop it.<br /><br />B) The US is the only industrialized country that cools their chicken carcasses in water instead of air cooling, creating a virtual disease pool filthier than a public toilet next to a crack house.  Why?  Because water adds weight, so you get the privilege of actually paying increased poundage for the putrid and infected water your chicken soaked in.<br /><br />C) Going against the National Academy of Science recommendations, the USDA relaxed standards and cut back on inspections while allowing production to increase over 40%.  The question is no longer \\"IF\\" there is fecal matter on your meat, but \\"HOW MUCH IS ACCEPTABLE\\".  Feces has been reclassified from a \\"Dangerous Contaminant\\" to a \\"Cosmetic Blemish\\".  So has hair, mucus, dirt, droppings, etc.<br /><br />D) With greed and profit being the only driving force behind the industry now, they have tried to pass the buck to you, the consumer, by telling you that the process of decontamination is up to YOU; i.e. cook your meat before you eat it.  When did the decontamination issue switch from containment BEFORE occurring to recovery AFTER they allowed the feces to literally pass under their noses?<br /><br />E) Working conditions in these Flesh Factories are deplorable, with chances of injury or illness six times greater than working in a coalmine.  Workers cannot leave the floor to take a bathroom break, and often urinate into the blood trench or on themselves.  If a worker removes a carcass as \\"condemned\\", the Supervisors at the plant often put it back into production and reprimand the worker.<br /><br />F) Slaughterhouses take advantage of immigrant labor, knowing they are too poverty stricken or scared to protest their working conditions.  The USDA Veterinarians who oversee the Plant's Inspection Line are mostly Foreigners, who fear for their jobs more than American workers.<br /><br />G) Animals go through the Kill Line ALIVE all the time, it is so common that slaughterhouse workers do not even see it as an infraction any longer, they are more worried for their own safety from dropped carcasses, flying hooves, slashing knives, faulty equipment, and inhumanely high speed Lines.<br /><br />So, are you scared yet?  I simply skimmed the surface of this book, and if you are not already terrified by these seven points, you should be.<br /><br />This isn't just about animal cruelty, or poor working conditions; its about the unfathomable corporate greed that we the people have let our Politicians slip past us, where only a few come out ahead and millions of others will suffer.  From the mistreated workers and their families, to taxpayers whose hard earned dollars are now paying for a toothless agency (USDA), all the way down to the victims of the tainted food passed down to us by an industry no longer accountable for its own greed.<br /><br />Ms. Eisnitz has sworn affidavits from people all across the industry, from plant workers and plant supervisors, USDA Inspectors and USDA Veterinarians, even a letter from the (then) Secretary of Agriculture Edward Madigan (who not only denied any wrongdoing in a letter, but also unwittingly documented that the USDA was breaking the law) stating that inspectors were not allowed near the line.<br /><br />She took her entire caseload of documented proof of the industry's greed, neglect, and cruelty to the shows 20/20, 60 Minutes, and other prime time media, but was told that her story was \\"Too Graphic\\" for the public-at-large to handle.<br /><br />Too Graphic?  We see war, murder, rape, incest, child abuse and more just on the 30 minute segment of news, and the media felt this would be \\"too graphic\\" for you, the consumer, to handle.  I found this horribly pompous of them, and have since written a letter to both shows.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was its lack of a reference listing; web sources and whatnot.  But Eisnitz does name names, and references the Human Farming Association if you want further information.  Overall, I highly recommend this book, but don't read it before dinner.

Meant to be for teens, as an \\"OMG, this could happen to YOU\\", it winds out being a tedious stroll through glossed over pages.<br /><br />There is no emotion in the characters; indeed, the book uses ten different POV's, and each of them read as identical personalities.  If you opened the book randomly, you would not be able to differentiate between narrators, even though they range from teenager to parents' POV.<br /><br />Compared to some really great novels on drug and heroin abuse like Luke Davies \\"Candy\\", Linda Glovich's \\"Beauty Queen\\", and the oldie but goodie \\"Go Ask Alice\\", \\"Smack\\" does nothing more than portray shallow teens with the message \\"heroin is messy\\".  It reminds me a bit of Mr. Mackey in the South Park series...\\"Drugs are bad, m'kay?  You shouldn't do drugs...m'kay?\\"<br /><br />Burgess pays more attention to Gemma's party dress than her withdrawal symptoms, and only once in over 300 pages mentions the crime of theft that goes hand and hand with street drug use.<br /><br />There is a horrifying decay of the soul that goes with drug addiction, and in a glossy, let's-skim-over-the-messy-parts portrayal such as \\"Smack\\", the message is lost for those who may truly need a slap-in-the-face wake up call.<br /><br />Save yourself the money, and pick up Candy, Beauty Queen, or Go Ask Alice instead of this shallow and emotionless mess.	2004-08-18

I wasn't disappointed, for the most part.<br /><br />Bushnell keeps up her frantic, fragmented pace in Four Blondes that she mastered with SITC, but takes a closer, edgier look at four women in particular.  While I thought these four women would interact throughout the book, they really don't.  It is actually four separate stories of New York women, and I think that let me down just a tad.<br /><br />First we have Janey, a model, who realizes her only ambition has been getting a man (any man) to pay for her summer in the Hamptons.  Of all four stories, I liked Janey's the best.  Though she is a ambitionless leech, I found myself actually liking her.<br /><br />Next is Winnie Dieke, married to James, no children.  Winnie is a journalist, as is James, and after seven years of marriage is wondering if James is the best she will ever do.  They don't care much for each other, but can't seem to let go of their relationship for mostly selfish reasons.<br /><br />Third is the story of Princess Cecelia, a beautiful girl who marries a real Prince.  This was my least favorite segment, and the reason my rating dropped from 4 stars to 3.  I simply could not relate to Cecilia at all, she had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I felt it was a little beneath Bushnell to not have come up with at least one, since she is so very good at making likeable personalities out of despicable people.<br /><br />Fourth and last, is the story of a writer to travels to England to write about how the English have bedroom relationships.  The first person narrator of this story is never named, except for what seems to be a nickname of \\"Minky\\".  Minky was definitely a fun personality, and someone I could see myself liking to be around.<br /><br />All in all, Four Blondes is a good book, but definitely better if you accustom yourself to Bushnell's style first with SITC.  Enjoy!!yourself to Bushnell's style first with SITC.  Enjoy!! <br />	2004-08-18

Have you ever sat in a coffee shop or your hometown's shopping mall, catching snippets of juicy conversations as they pass by you?  $eXz In The City, the book, is just like that only better.<br /><br />In SITC, you get to listen to the snippets of the rich and famous, the ultimately wealthy, and the downright notorious; something you don't get at home.<br /><br />Though built upon shallow ideals, the characters are anything but shallow; they are witty, charming, self-centered, goal-orientated, and real.  The storyline, though it is told in fragments not unlike a diary that many people have written in, manages to stay smooth and yet spontaneous in its wandering courses.<br /><br />Both the Cable Show and the book stem from a column Candace Bushnell started writing for The New York Observer back in 1994, where she decided to remove the sentimental value from relationships and mating rituals and replace it with a healthy, well needed injection of sardonic humor.  Thanks to Ms. Bushnell, we have such wonderful glimpses into this taboo subject like \\"The M&M's\\", \\"The Modelizers\\", \\"Psycho Moms\\", \\"Bicycle Boys\\", \\"Dweebs, Nerds, and Losers\\", \\"Comparison Shopping\\", \\"The Nanny Camera\\", and many more.<br /><br />SITC is a wonderfully fun, kick-back-and-relax kind of book; a lively and fun story that reminds you not to take yourself so seriously all the time.  I highly recommend it for a lazy afternoon or a sunny day at the beach.  Enjoy!	2004-08-18

I picked up this book to read before going to sleep one night, and wound up not stopping until I finished at 3AM.  Luke Davies has written a completely absorbing tale of a spiraling journey into the night of addiction.<br /><br />I am a horror aficionado, enjoyer of the ripening decay of flesh, bone, and blood; but in Candy there is a different Monster, a stealthy beast formed from powdery particles that feeds upon the very soul of man, tearing apart mind and spirit long before its teeth sink into the flesh.<br /><br />So poignantly told in first person perspective, I was so deeply moved by this sad, bittersweet tale of innocent love that I was desperate to see the sun come up in the morning, though for a moment I doubted it would.<br /><br />Rarely am I as deeply moved by a story as I was by Candy, and rarer still is an author who can breathe such animated life into his character.  How can I possibly care about this guy, a junkie who steals and scams allows his wife to work as a prostitute while he nods in front of the TV all night?  How can I care about Candy, who goes from aspiring actress to thousand dollar a day escort to street-hooking in the projects?<br /><br />But I wound out caring a LOT, staying by them just as they stayed by each other, through all the highs and the bitter lows.  Their love for each other is immense, innocent, and touching; making you believe just as they did that love can conquer all.<br /><br />The book follows approximately ten years of their lives, from high-end apartments, to projects, to a run down farm in the country; through crimes and arrests and prostitution; through love and marriage and the loss of a baby; through the languid highs and the horrors of trying to kick the habit; Davies makes you actually feel their love, and their pain.  I am not a crier, but I almost did after Candy, the ache I felt inside was so huge and hopeless that it left me weak with sadness.<br /><br />With all the emotion spilling out from the pages, remember to prepare yourself for some rough scenes; like graphic descriptions of vein hunting and needle usage, along with a disgusting crab lice incident that almost made me hurl.<br /><br />Plain and simple, this is a `Wow' book; an all-nighter so well written you will feel that you just stayed up with your old friend, listening to him pour out his heart to you.

Last Trip to Vegas is an amazingly fast book, grabbing you from the beginning and keeping pace through the end.  I found there was a very surprising depth to the book that defied how fast it went; for me just a few hours and I was done.<br /><br />The prose is simple and the dialogue direct, its the people involved that grab your attention and whisk you through the pages.  Some people are nice and some people are heartless, and you may find them trading places along the way.<br /><br />Jack Kathio is a cold and calculating gambler, and also broke.  Until he finds that his B-Negative blood type matches that of young, leukemia-ridden Sheila Carlucci.  Playing on the hearts of Sheila's parents, Vito and Celi, he manages to get them to sign over everything that they own in the world before he allows the bone-marrow transplant.<br /><br />From Chicago to Las Vegas, he pulls the Carlucci's into his world of gambling and living life to its fullest.  But his goal is not a noble one; what he wants most of all is Mia, wife to Jack's friend, highway patrolman Frank McMahan.  Jack convinces Frank and Mia to come visit him in Vegas, and sends Frank down a dark road of compulsive gambling.<br /><br />Last Trip To Vegas is both depressing and uplifting, an odd combination but certainly an enjoyable one.  It was also nice to read about Freemont Street back before it was covered and closed off; heck, before the Strip became such a mess.  Adams manages to bring the Vegas experience so vividly to life that you can practically feel the grit between your teeth.<br /><br />Though there are some printing errors in the book, mostly missing punctuation, and a bit of choppy scene-jumping, the overall quality of this bold, tell-it-like-it-is tale of money and lust and loss and friendship is well worth the money spent.<br /><br />But I warn you again, its fast and its addictive...like gambling.  If you are traveling, pick up another book for the second half of your flight.  Enjoy!!<br />	2004-08-03

Perdido Street Station can be compared to a glittering diamond, multi-faceted and riviting and mind-expanding.<br /><br />China Mieville is a spectacular writer, and artist with an ink-pen rather than paintbrush, but he nevertheless paints out the city of New Crobuzon with vivid detail and fertile imagrey.  This book literally took my breath away.<br /><br />Revealing the barest glimpse of the plot, scientist Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin is contracted by a disfigured Garuda, a bird-like being, to help him fly again.  The Garuda, Yagharek, had his wings removed as punishment for a crime he committed.<br /><br />Isaac, an ingenious and energetic man, takes on Yag's challenge.  In the course of his studies on Flight, Isaac unwittingly nurtures and releases a horrifying creature called a Slake Moth.  Joining with it's four newly released brothers and sisters, the Slake Moths begin to feed on New Crobuzon, sucking up the souls and dreams of those who inhabit the city.  Now, Isaac and Yag must find out if there is any way to stop these elusive predators.<br /><br />It really seems horrid to sum up Perdido's plot in two short and stilted paragraphs, when in actuality the real star of Meiville's book is the intensity of New Crobuzon itself, and it simply must be experienced rather than described.<br /><br />Really, reading PSS is like eating a mud pie, it is so very rich.  With interesting spins and deeply descriptive prose, you will find yourself completely absorbed in the city; smelling its rotting channels and feeling its decay, standing in awe at the top of a spire looking down over the criss-crossed Train Lines and Militia's Skyrails.<br /><br />There is Isaac's lover, a insectoid-humanoid named Lin, with whom his stolen moments are precious because love between humans and Khepri is forbidden.  There is The Weaver, a spider-being that travels across the fibers of the WorldWeb, sliding from one plain of existence to the next.<br /><br />And throughout the city are The Remade; whether for enhancement or punishment, these are meldings of human and animal and machine into whatever bizarre forms are requisitioned.

You will find grotesqueries revulsion, stimulation, comedy, blood and gore, surrealism, and many other oddities that melted in a very satisfactory way on my horror palate.<br /><br /> At the back, Editor John Edward Lawson has kindly included short bios of the contributing authors, which is always a nice dessert after a horror read to me.<br /><br /> My absolute favorite story would have to be 'A Night To Remember With Mocha Sumatra', by Mark McLaughlin.<br /><br /> Very honorable mentions would also be:<br /><br /> The Garbage Eaters by Scott Christian Carr<br /><br /> The Legend Of Jimmy Wad by Vincent W. Sakowski<br /><br /> Wuornos by Harold Jaffe<br /><br /> The Will Of The Dresser, The Will Of The Blender by Kevin L. Donihe and satan165.<br /><br /> The Wishing Urn by Steve Goldsmith<br /><br /> The King Old Fellow by James Chambers<br /><br /> Drainage by Christian Westerlund<br /><br /> Along Came Auntie Rose Mary by Brutal Dreamer<br /><br /> And many many more.<br /><br /> If you like horror anthologies as much as I do, craving that tiniest of snacks before bedtime to feed and nurture the coming nightmare, then you must own a copy of Sick. It fed my soul just fine.<br /><br /> Of notable mention also is the amazing cover art of this book by David Anthony Migitis. I strongly recommend if you like surreal, odd, despairing artwork; you should check out his other works. Very talented artist.

If you have been pursuing some dark paths like I have lately, perhaps you have treated yourself to some Hellish excursions like Edward Lee's City Infernal and Infernal Angel, or Jeffrey Thomas's Letters From Hades, which were all dark and succulent journeys into those nameless lands below.<br /><br />So if you enjoyed your travelings with Lee and Thomas, you are going to absolutely love Poisoning Eros.<br /><br />But this time bring your barf bag.<br /><br />As with many books I enjoy, this treat by Wrath James White will leave you heaving over your commode for days, retching up the vile words that you so fiercly consumed, and running back for more.<br /><br />Definitely as gross as Excitable Boys by Kelly Laymon, I strongly advise you against this book if you have a weak constitution.  The are many beastly couplings, including demonic, that are explicitly drawn out by Mr. White and left on your plate for you to taste their exquisitely repugnant flavors.  Make sure your antacid is nearby.<br /><br />Gloria has been a working girl her whole life, and her life has run its course from where she once sat at the top of the heap as a Porn Movie Princess, to the present where she will do absolutely anything for enough money to get a fix.<br /><br />Her looks are gone and her money is gone, and all that is left to her is the sweet bliss of drugs.  But Gloria falls in with the wrong man, a demonic creature who will pay her well but demand her soul in return.  When she tries to leave him, he pulls up the daughter from her past and threatens to destroy the girl that Gloria barely knew.<br /><br />How far will Gloria go to right the wrongs of her life?  What does her soul look like in Hell, and will she ever be able to salvage the love of her child that she so carelessly threw away so many years ago?<br /><br />If you like well written stories with horrific visions that will haunt you long after you are finished, then make sure to pick up a copy of Poisoning Eros.  Well worth the price, but remember to spend a little extra and have that barf bag on hand.  Enjoy!s.  Well worth the price, but remember to spend a little extra and have that barf bag on hand.

I am hooked on Jeffrey Thomas, one of the most talented new writers I have come across in ages.  His stories in both Punktown and Punktown Third Eye left me slavering for more.<br /><br />Letters From Hades has satisfied that hunger.  I enjoy well-written books that deal with an author's vision of what that fiery hell will be like, and Jeffrey Thomas lets you actually feel the despair and hopelessness that permeate The Great Below.<br /><br />Written in the form of a diary, we follow our nameless protagonist as he learns the ropes in Hell.  He awakens in hell after his suicide, and immediately sent off to the Avernus University, where he is forced to learn that every pain that lies before him is deserved, and that repentance is futile.  After his crusifixion at graduation, he is set free to find his place in hell.  And through his journeys, he keeps his diary.<br /><br />Thomas's vision of hell is unique, with many different types of daemons; from eight foot tall skeletons with green fire coming out of their heads, to pale white, human like winged creatures.<br /><br />He sets out for the city of Oblivion, making his way through and eerie purple forest, and past the Harvesters that plow through a field of human heads, and meets up with Chara along the way.<br /><br />Chara is a near human demon, impaled to a tree and left to die.  Our protagonist frees her in a burst of compassion, and unwittingly sets off a destructive trend in Oblivion.  He also falls in love with Chara, a forbidden love that neither of them can deny.<br /><br />With time running out and the revolution of damned against demon heating up, they must flee Oblivion and find a place where they can be together.<br /><br />The story itself is very good, but you will find more than a simple tale in Letters From Hades.  You will laugh as you witness a motorcycle gang of Angels descending into hell to participate in drive-by shootings of the Damned, you will shudder at the sight of the Black Cathedral as it materializes in your neighborhood, you will feel beauty as you watch a purple praying mantis crawling over purple leaves, and you will tremble in terror at the sight of the Torture Plants.<br /><br />This is a fully fleshed out fantasy land of a dark and twisted nature, one that will leave you enriched for having walked its treacherous sands and traversed it's blacked pathways.

Seven stories that will have you romping through fetid pools of vomit, diarrhea, deviant couplings, weirdos, giant Poo-Monsters, canibalism, and more.  Truly, the sickest collection I have read to date, that still held itself together with talented writers that actually keep a plot running through all the grotesqueries.<br />In the forward by Kelly Laymon, she explains being at the Gross-Out contest at the World Horror Convention.  These gross out sessions are where the horror writers gather for readings of their most disgusting compositions, and (in Laymon's words), &quot;let their freak flags fly&quot;.  Laymon decided that these tales of aberration and vileness needed to be published, and so along came Excitable Boys.  (Thank you Ms. Laymon!)<br />With each tale, Laymon adds a small, interesting blurb about the author at the end of their story, which I found to be a nice addition.  And she managed to pull in the artwork of GAK, a talented and twisted new artist whose sketches and drawings I have come to love in such other books as Dead Cat Bouncing.  Just check out the cover art of Excitable Boys, and know there are other visual treats from GAK inside.<br />First is &quot;Good Care&quot;, by Rain Graves.  In my opinion, by far the sickest because it deals with the horrors of child abuse.<br />#2 is &quot;The Constipated Cannibal&quot;, by Michael McCarthy.  Very short, but any longer and I would have retched.<br />#3 is &quot;The McCrath Model SS40-C, Series S&quot; by master Edward Lee.  This is a Paul Vinchetti story, which if you have read his stomach-heaving &quot;Mr. &amp; Miss Torso&quot;, you would already be introduced to this vile mafia Don.<br />#4 is &quot;Full Of It&quot; by Brian Keene, whose twisted and gross stories I have read before and loved.  Here, we meet the Poo-Monster.<br />#5 is &quot;Attack Of The Fifty-Foot Prisonbitch&quot; by Mark McLaughlin.  This is the funniest story in the collection, of a &quot;Leave It To Beaver&quot; type husband and wife who own the Bone Ami Adult Arcade, and pleasantly discuss their most deviant customers.  This tale also brings in a little dark fantasy as well, with some odd creatures and, of course, the 50 foot Prisonbitch.<br />#6 is &quot;A Heartful Of Love, A Bowelful Of Hate&quot; by Gavin Williams.  Definitely one of the sickest in the lot, it is a zombie tale of a truly dysfunctional family.  Complete with zombie animals!<br />#7 is &quot;Genital Grinder: A Snuff Film In Five Acts&quot; by Ryan Harding.  According to Ms. Laymon, this is the story that started her on the path to this collection.  And of course, the worst is saved for last.  Snot, bolt cutters, cheese graters, saws, venereal diseases, maggots, machetes, brains, and two of the most sadistic amateur filmmakers ever created.<br />Completing the book is a funny, true tale by author Geoff Cooper called &quot;Just Like Chicken&quot; where he recounts a rather funny incident at the World Horror Conventions Gross-Out readings.  A true encore to these foul additions to your horror collection that will leave you laughing.<br />Kelly Laymon is the daughter of Richard Laymon, celebrated author of horror and shock-horror.  Truly, she has been well tutored.<br />This book is definitely not for the squeamish or the feint of heart.  It is a horror collection of the grossest sort, and even afficionados like myself are best left reading it on an empty stomach.<br />Enjoy!

Re-reading &quot;I, Robot&quot; before the movie comes out was a good idea, I'm glad I did.  For me, reading Asimov if often a fond trip down memory lane.<br />But if you have never read Asimov or looking for somewhere to start, I would highly recommend &quot;I, Robot&quot; as a first glimpse into Asimov's world(s).  Here is a wonderful and timeless collection of nine short stories that all center around a central theme; The Three Laws Of Robotics.<br />The three laws are: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.  2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br />These laws are the central theme to each individual story, and connecting them is a running &quot;Runaround&quot;, &quot;Reason&quot;, and &quot;Catch That Rabbit&quot;.  Always under the direst of circumstances, they must figure out the malfunction of the robot before something terrible happens.  Very entertaining stories.<br />Some of the other stories are about Dr. Calvin's personal experiences, such as &quot;Liar&quot; and &quot;Little Lost Robot&quot;, but all fall back onto the laws as their basic theme, and whether or not humans will ever accept robots among them.<br />Once finished with &quot;I, Robot&quot;, I very highly recommend the &quot;Foundation&quot; series, one of my favorite Asimov themes, along with the Robot Trilogy and another favorite, &quot;Nightfall&quot;.  Asimov has the gift of creating lively, likeable characters with a technical backdrop to his all-to-human stories, and always infuses a bit of humor into them.<br />Truly one of the great masters of Sci-Fi, Asimov is a must-read in my opinion, and &quot;I, Robot&quot; is a wonderful starting point.<br />Enjoy!	2004-07-10

Of course, you must be in the mood.  More horror than sex, most of the stories focus mainly on the mindset of persons who have been emotionally harmed in some way.  And of course, all seem to have a heavy bondage influence to them.<br />Some, like \\"A Trail Of Pain And Letters\\", are quite direct; while others like \\"Tongue\\" are a surrealistic journey into a scarred mind.  The last three stories are a trilogy, connected together by the characters yet portraying separate occasions in their lives.  Of all the stories, I liked the Max Trilogy the best.<br />Though Max is our protagonist, he is not a particularly nice guy, because inside him he carries a Beast.  Though his twin prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, he excises his beast only to find out later that he will need the Beast's spirit to survive.  The twins, Alioune and Kueur, are not what they seem to be either, with their father being a God and their mother a Dragon Dream.  In the second of the Max stories, \\"Angel Of Death\\", we visit the Painfreak club for only the second time in the book.<br />My biggest problem with this book was actually the font.  Only 115 pages, it's a slim book but the font is so tiny and packed on each page that it was hard to read even with my reading glasses.  But all in all, this is an excellent addition to your erotic horror collection.  Also try \\"I Shudder At Your Touch\\" and \\"Poisoning Eros\\".<br />Enoy!<br />Table Of Contents:<br />1) Painfreak<br />2) Safe Word<br />3) Painted Faces<br />4) The Night Pain<br />5) Hot Thing<br />6) Trail Of Pain And Letters<br />7) Tongue<br />8) The Beast That Was Max<br />9) Angel Of Death<br />10) Deamons Of Blood And Passion	2004-07-09

But her fears are back to confront her too, and as soon as the Blood creatures show up once again, so does the oddly dressed stranger who saved her before, looking as though he had not aged one bit.<br />Things happen at a rapid pace in this book, with a blood dome being built over the camp, terribly hungry creatures (called Bloodans) everywhere, absorbing and taking the shapes of those they have eaten, and an unexpected twist that throws in some time travel and alternate realities, all combine to keep the pages turning quickly.<br />Clearly sticking true to his word, Fuchs created a B-Horror Book as quick and flowing as a movie.  Though previously published, Fuchs is still new in the field, and A Red Dark Night also shows that the potential is there for more entertainments from him.  So grab some popcorn, curl up by yourself so that your imagination is unencumbered with outside noises and distractions, and enjoy the show.with outside noises and distractions, and enjoy the show.	2004-07-08

I like dead things, I like squishy things, I like bloody, bony, and crusty things.  But I don't like Lenore.<br />Lenore is booked as being a cute little dead girl, but she does nothing to act dead.  She is more like a cute, wide-eyed Dennis The Menace, doing mean spirited things to small animals and her friends, while playing leap frog and having parties and taking bubble baths.<br />It only took maybe fifteen minutes to read the entire book, most of the comic cells being sparse of images and words, and to make matters worse, the images are below the standards I have become used.  Consider other graphic novels like Slave Labor Graphic's masterpiece, JTHM, the many graphic works of Neil Gaimen, and even Junji Ito's Uzumaki series.<br />I did not laugh once, and give Lenore two stars only for the two short skits that made me smile a bit, &quot;The Boy With His Heart In A Box&quot; and &quot;Things Involving Me&quot;, neither of which featured Lenore at all.<br />There is nothing gothic, spooky or even very dark here, kind of like twilight settling over a pig farm.  A few poorly remade nursery rhymes, a lot of blank or minimally drawn cells, and no plot to be found at all.<br />With &quot;Lenore: Noogies&quot; being too adult for children, and too childish for adults, my recommendation is to leave it on the shelf and go grab Uzumaki or JTHM.	2004-07-08

When reading online magazines, one does not want to scroll forever, and the eyes will tire; which is where flash fiction lights up to its best advantage.<br />Whether calling it Flash Fiction or Minimalist Horror, 100 Jolts is a shockingly delightful romp through some very sticky, and very slimy, situations.  Michael Arnzen clearly demonstrates that he has been working with Flash for some time, showing off these bereft-poetry-haiku type of &quot;smack you in the face&quot; stories with style and substance.<br />We have all occasionally read those droll books where an author takes a 50 page story and pads it into 500 pages of tedious reading, and 100 Jolts is the exact opposite of those snooze fests.  In this book, there is the sense that a 50 page story has been pared down past the meat into the skeletal frame and left us quivering with the ringing of steel on bone, as Arnzen slices off the juiciest of the story just for us, handing it out to us on a tiny platter, a toothy grin gracing his face.<br />Well, eat up, boys and girls!  100 Jolts is one of the best collections of this new type of fiction I have seen yet.  There were a few pieces that left me disappointed, having the feeling of a muse or a simply jotted idea, but the rest of this thin volume left my hunger satisfied and my mind whirling with the impact, exactly how the author intended.<br />And for those of us with a warped or twisted sense of humor, you will find a chuckle or two lurking here also.<br />Some of my favorites include: Skull Fragments, Take Out, Stabbing For Dummies, White Out, The Seven Headed Beast, Psycho Hunter, Inside The Man With No Eyelids, Burning Bridges, Next Door, Nightmare Job #3, Five Mean Machines, The Eight Ball In Big Mouth's Pocket, An Evil Eye, The Blood Ran Out, How To Grow A Man Eating Plant, and Domestic Fowl.<br />Those are just a tiny sampling of the works collected here.  With stories ranging from two or three sentences to two or three pages, this book is perfect for a beach afternoon, a late night flight, or a nice little story before bedtime.<br />Enjoy!, and Domestic Fowl.<br />Those are just a tiny sampling of the works collected here.

Sure, its twisted, but the cartoons are so comical and the situations so improbable that you just have to laugh at them.<br />Keep in mind, this is a cartoon book for adults only, it is far too violent for children; but come on adults...it's a cartoon book.  It is not a portrayal of realistic violence in our society.  The world was a less violent place back when the<br />Road Runner constantly trashed Wile E. Coyote, and perhaps the reason I found Creepy Susie to be so funny was that it breathed life back into the funny aspect of mortality.<br />My favorites would have to be The Debbies (treat yourself here and use the \\"Look Inside\\" feature of Amazon to read The Debbies), Stupid Betsy, Waldo & Bean, Narcoleptic Scottie, Rosie's Crazy Mother, and Jenny, Jenny, Jenny & Babette: The Siamese Quadruplets.<br />Whether snipping off tiny heads, shoving marbles in your butt, collecting Poo, holding slimy things, cross dressing, shaving cats and putting yellow sticky pads on them, offing your brother, or simply cooking up your parents; you will be sure to find humor not just in the written words but also in the comical and silly artwork here in Creepy Susie.<br />I would give it 8 stars if I could.

Hardly pornographic at all, this small and simple book is filled with insinuations of events that could quite possibly be indecent or tawdry, but remain veiled, allowing the reader to reach their own conclusions.<br />While The Curious Sofa is amusing in its naive and capricious way, it is not a \\"bust out laughing\\" piece of entertainment, and made me smile but not laugh.  I'm not entirely sure that is worth the $9.00 price.  It would be more recommendable if it was half the price and marketed more as a novelty or gift item.<br />When looking at purchasing this item, take note of the small size of the book and the number of pages. The book is little enough to be a stocking stuffer at Christmas time, and the page count says 64, but it is actually only 32, because the printing is one-sided, so there is only one picture per page turn, opposite pages are all blank.<br />The drawings, while indeed whimsical, were not particularly special, and the only one who could possibly label anything in this book \\"pornographic\\" would be Mother Goose.  We never do get to see this Curious Sofa either, and I found that to be the difference between feeling titillated with the unseen, and feeling cheated out of something that could have been special.<br />Overall, it would be a nice gift item if the price were lower, but at $9.00 for 32 pages with no real conclusion to the tale, leave it on the shelf.	2004-07-05

Where can you find an intelligent and witty glimpse into the sickened, insane, cold-blooded mind of a habitual killer?  Right here with Johnny, The Homicidal Manic.<br />This is clearly a graphical novel for adults only (read the title, parents!), JTHM is a bloody and savage treat to the warped followers of horror and horror satire.  If you ever laughed when the Road Runner dropped the Coyote off a cliff and turned him into an accordion, then you should find a chuckle or two in Vasquez's humorous look at homicidal mania.<br />The cartoons are brutally savage and yet excruciatingly funny, but don't worry because they are all done in black and white so the gore is not as intense as it could have been.  Interspersed with Vasquez's storyline are tiny text boxes that cement the fact that this is a satire with such thoughtful comments as how the scene was filmed (its a picture), and cautionary remarks like &quot;Parents: Don't get upset - It's a fake brain.&quot; and &quot;Stupid People: I would ask you to keep in mind that this should *not* be a source of moral guidance.&quot; and &quot;Kids, don't be stupid and try this:  this is a trained flying toddler.&quot;<br />Hilarious little blurbs like these are also accompanied by Noodle Boy breaks.  Happy Noodle Boy is the comic strip that Johnny writes, the second (and worse) cartoon within a cartoon, along the lines of &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; to The Simpsons and &quot;Terrance &amp; Phillip&quot; to South Park.<br />You will indulge your darker half with the intelligent debates between Johnny and his victims, see a gruesome Public Service Announcement, discover that God is a fat baby in a lounge chair and that the devil is a cheerleader.  The dialogue is clever, the drawings hilarious, the storyline amusing, and the satire thick and twisted.  Everything a horror fan could want in a graphic book.<br />The cells are quite busy, but take your time reading this dripping black jewel; you don't want to miss the extras thrown into each frame.  Also take note of those chapters with scrolled or fancy looking borders.

This hidden treasure is not just a learning vessel, nor a simple encyclopedia; it is one of the best writing tools I have found to date.<br />While first published in 1977, it does not loose its bite nor its potency with the passing of time.  Full to the brim with useful information, though there may be modernizations in some areas, it stays nonetheless accurate and informative.<br />This is a fully fleshed out reference tool, 321 pages of tightly packed information, extremely useful in helping to create the sources of your illnesses or spells or hexes; even creating mystery around your Deity's laws, worship practices, or punishments.<br />Man And The Beasts Within explores, in encyclopedia form, parts of the human body and human psyche, and what their meanings are in relationship to religion, folklore, occult, myth, mysticism, and physical complaint.<br />For example; Acclivity, Arms, Epigastrium, Dreams, Dying, Hair, Hand, Kissing, Lungs, Pregnancy, Saliva, Sleep, Virginity, Viscera, to Xenophrenia.<br />If we look up Epigastrium, we find that it is the region in the middle of the upper abdomen in front of the stomach extending from sternum to navel.<br />In a physical scene, a blow to this area would be damaging.  In a mystical or occultism sense, this would be the site of one of the most important &quot;plexuses&quot; (a focal point where the subtle body meets the physical body, a generator of pneumic energy) and is also believed to be the spot where our &quot;astral cord&quot; lies, that tethers our astral body to our physical body.<br />There is a wealth of information like this on any of the given subjects, something that I have found to be invaluable when I am scheming up nasty little afflictions or demonic attacks or fantastical power sources.  Simply put, this is a wonderful tool for whatever you need to dream up, and will most likely help you nail down that villainous monster or set free the source of your hero's dominance.<br />This is a hardcover, heavy book though, and not a good traveling tool.  If you are traveling, pick up The Dictionary Of The Occult And Paranormal by J.P. Caplin.  It is slim and compact and also a great reference tool for those who write horror, sci-fi, and fantasy.<br />Enjoy!  And go pick that pen up!eavy book though, and not a good traveling tool.

I don't often review non-fiction books, so I am rolling the flavor of this review around on my tongue trying to figure out how to interpret my taste of the book.<br />The good points of the book are how Mr. Quinn outlines areas of defense for your community to patrol, like watching all of the zoning requests, even from companies that seem to have nothing to do with WalMart, for often they will purchase and then lease out to the hungry beast.<br />He gives website information at the end of the book, so that if your interest (and ire) have been adequately sparked, there are outlets for your fiery resistance to flow into.<br />And, he gives factual information on the tactics that WalMart uses to infiltrate small-town America and ruthlessly destroy small business owners.<br />Most shocking to everybody should be the fact that WalMart is now the number one large-business employer in America...paying minimum wage and considering 28 hours a week to be &quot;full time&quot;.  No wonder America is slowly becoming a third-world country.  In the past, when I actually shopped at WalMart, I felt like I was entering a third world country when I passed through those wheezing doors.  Now I know why.<br />Teetering on the edge of good-point/bad-point is the simplistic writing style of Quinn's book.  On the one hand, it is easy to read and gets the point across rapidly.  On the other hand, it tends to sound a bit like Grandpa &quot;going off&quot; as he sat around the old stove at night.  (Sigh...those good old days long before WalMart...)<br />The single most blatant bad point about this book was the fact that *not once* did Quinn mention that the simplest way to stop a carnivorous corporate giant like this is to STOP SHOPPING THERE.  He made it sound so much like these places were plowed over with a bulldozer of incomprehensible size, when the simple statement of PROTEST NOW could go a lot further than the whining of people left in the destructive wake of this beast.<br />Quinn also fails to mention that Small Business (as a singular entity) is still the number one employment means in America, and that it is worthy of supporting NOW before the claws of the giant draw arterial blood.<br />The facts are that the general American wage is dropping because of minimum wage corporate giants like WalMart; that more people employed at poverty wage mean a greater burden on the country as a whole, and if left to the &quot;Savage Capitolism&quot; of Walmart, rather than the competitive forces of individuals and small business owners, America will eventually become a third world country itself...with a few very wealthy folks and an overall population of slave labor forces.<br />This book is very good in that it is based on real information and will stir you into some sort of anger.  The bad point is that Quinn should have spent more time in pro-active response rather than re-active response.<br />Bottom line:  If you don't like their presence, don't shop there.  If people didn't patronize these places, they would go out of business.  *steps off soapbox...bows to Quinn*lso fails to mention that Small Business (as a singular entity) is still the number one employment means in America, and that it is worthy of supporting NOW before the claws of the giant draw arterial blood.  <br />The facts are that the general American wage is dropping because of minimum wage corporate giants like WalMart; that more people employed at poverty wage mean a greater burden on the country as a whole, and if left to the &quot;Savage Capitolism&quot; of Walmart, rather than the competitive forces of individuals and small business owners, America will eventually become a third world country itself...with a few very wealthy folks and an overall population of slave labor forces.<br />This book is very good in that it is based on real information and will stir you into some sort of anger.

Wade is a man who is instantly placed at the bottom of the human existence; a surly, unlikable alcoholic leading his despairing family into ruin.  In the rural backwoods of Mississippi, he finds an abandoned shack complete with weeds growing up through the pale floorboards and settles himself in with his wife and three remaining children; Gary, Fay, and Dorothy.<br />And then we meet Joe Ransom, who scratches out his living by clearing out land tracts by poisoning the trees in order for them to be removed, working a crew of low and shiftless men.  Joe has led a hard life, but remains a simple man with simple needs; booze, cigarettes, and women.  He stops by the post office to visit his estranged wife at her job, yet continues to exercise his weakness for his young girlfriend Connie, who is the same age as his pregnant daughter.<br />Joe winds out hiring Gary, who is young and energetic and eager to make enough money to get away from his shiftless father.  Joe takes a shine to Gary, and winds out sort of taking him under his wing, not so much as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; but rather from a desire to save the boy from the fate that would become his at the hands of his brutal father.<br />This is not a novel of a thickened plot unraveling at breakneck speeds towards an explosive conclusion; it is a poetically written journey through the intimate details of a life that will make no impact on the world as a whole.  It is life lived at its most base of levels, survival on a day-to-day existence of needs versus means.<br />You will find nothing truly admirable in any character between these pages, but you will find yourself involved in their tough and gritty lives whether you desire to be there or not.  Brown's writing is so completely poetic that it flows with a silken shimmer even through the foul waters of Joe's life.  The details of Joe and Gary's lives in all of their everyday mundane details are exposed in the rawest form, earthy and folksy, and horrifying in their acceptance of it.<br />You will be confronted by evil in its purest form; ignorant and uncaring, when you first meet Wade and later meet Willie Russell.  Evil has never been more ignorant or ruthlessly sociopathic than this, a terrifying ride on the derailed train of alcoholism and entitlement, that culminates in broken lives and shattered futures.<br />I found the ending to be incomplete, designed to make you feel like you are guessing what the outcome of the confrontation will be; until you realize in your heart that you already know Joe all too well, and the outcome is less guessable when that very fact is digested.<br />Brown's writing is so lyrical and flowing that despite the horrifying content and obnoxious, unpleasant characters, you become entranced in the numbing realism of the poverty and desperation that takes place.<br />In my opinion, Brown is an absolute must-read, and because he can write so well about places and characters that are so hard to like or even relate to, I feel that he should become required reading for students of literature and art.

I cannot even think of this book, and of the protagonist Fay, without thinking of the word \\"Bovine\\" and having the image of a sloe-eyed cow meander through the lush fields of my mind.<br />Fay has left her abusive father behind, leaving without a penny to her name or even a place to go.  Not that she had enough education to spell out where she thought she was, for that matter.  But Fay is a pretty girl, often referred to being \\"well endowed\\" above the waist (again the image of the cow), and she is quite accomodating to the frail-minded men who find her.<br />The novel Fay is a sort-of continuation of Brown's previous novel \\"Joe\\", in that Joe outlined the horrendous character of Fay's father Wade.  But that is pretty much where the tie ends, and Fay the novel does not reference much back to Joe.  And even then, Joe does not explain Fay's sociopathic disregard for others, except for the possibility of heredity.  She was never molested the way her younger sister was, though she did live in extreme poverty and have to fight off her father.<br />In this novel, we will follow the extremely unlikable and bovinely stupid Fay through a series of men, who she uses for a place to stay and food to eat while keeping her eye out for greener pastures.  I still don't know who made me the angriest, Fay or the dumb men who fell for her charms.<br />In her wake she leaves behind men and bodies, first plowing through Sam the State Patrolman to eventually settle in with Aaron, a no count low life who cannot separate love from abuse, but looks \\"like he could take good care of you\\".<br />I was utterly transfixed by this glimpse into the mind of a woman who had no clue how to fend for herself, and found it easier to hang around letting men take care of her rather than get a job or even try to make her life better.  Fay's dependency on men and her disregard for the lives of others that her stupidity impacted left me open-jawed with shock.<br />So why the four stars?  Because Brown is a truly poetic writer, the words flow across the pages underneath the gentle melodies of poetry in motion, while your mind digests the deeply fleshed and vapid personalities of the characters with discordant jangling of a fire alarm.<br />Love them or hate them, victim or criminal, you will still find yourself drawn into these pathetic lives, involved at a level that is both uncomfortable in its intimacy and compelling in its desire.  Brown is a truly talented and gifted writer, and though the journey may leave you with mud and tobacco stains on your pants-leg, you will still find that you are happy you accepted the ride.

Wounded and hungry, completely unaware of its surroundings, it begins to feed, needing strength to continue its journey.<br />Enter the town of Windshake.  It's a quiet mountain town, only just beginning to be discovered by developers.  It is typically populated with a thin veneer of middle class who overlay the larger collection of dirt poor white trash.  Moonshine stills, logging roads, mountain cabins and trailer parks all combine to overcome any real influence from the nearby small University, where Tamara Leon teaches.<br />She had moved out of the city in order for her husband Robert to take a job at a local yokel radio station, the only job he could find.  Bye-bye city life, hello Moose Lodge and Hog Calling.  Tamara carries a heavier weight on her shoulders than just moving her family out into the sticks, for she suffers from what she calls \\"The Gloomies\\", which is nothing more than a form of ESP.<br />The second major character is Chester Mull, a crotchety mountain man who's day is filled by drinking moonshine on his porch with his ancient hound dog, at least until the mountain begins to glow a sickly green and his friend Oscar stumbles into his yard looking more plant than man.<br />Scott Nicholson has done an absolutely tremendous job with this novel, bringing the small town people into fully fleshed reality, and revealing Windshake as a place you can not only see but smell and taste and feel.<br />The Harvest is one of those stories that is about the entire town, with a few foremost characters leading the hunt for what ails their community.  The usual problems seen with books like this are shallow characterizations, which you certainly won't find here.  The sinful Preacher, the overly religious Parishioner who is falling for the church secretary, the white trash trailer park queen, the dope smoking teenagers, the fat and lazy sheriff, the excessively arrogant mayor, the successful moonshiner; all are completely introduced as individuals who you will love to hate, or hate to love.<br />Tamara and Chester make an unlikely team when finally they meet up, and with a couple of fellow believers they undertake the daunting task of destroying the creature that has extended its tendrils into their town.<br />There is something to be said for a joyfully entertaining, wildly unrealistic adventure into a nightmare landscape or horror and helplessness.  Not every book is a work of art, and not every work of art is entertaining, so if you want a hoity-toity art book, go pick up a Tolstoy.  But if what you are looking for is a roller-coaster ride filled with aliens, inhuman hunger, green guts, bizarre plants, gaping earth-mouths, and squishy things that go bump in the night, then grab a copy of The Harvest and settle in for the ride.

There doesn't seem to be much information available about this book, so I am actually quite glad that I picked it up on a recommendation from a friend.<br />The Sociopath is a work of fiction, most of it told in the first person by our protagonist.  It does, however, cleverly skip around in both time-frame and point-of-view; but don't let that stop you from picking it up.  What sounds like it could be annoying or hard to follow is in reality a very smooth, very fast read.  I finished this book in one day (a beach-read) and I am definitely *not* a speed-reader.<br />The book did not contain enough gore for me, being a fan of such Gorror writers as Edward Lee and Jack Ketchum and Jeff Long; but it makes up for its lack of blood in the chillingly distracted narrative of some very unsocial behavior.<br />I absolutely refuse to give anything away here, but there *is* a sociopath in the book, and our first person narrator has a very big surprise for you in store.<br />Although I loved the book and recommend it highly, I felt that the ending did fall short of the entire story's potential, especially with one character kind of left stranded out on his limb tidying up another character's loose threads.  I felt he should have been visited in more depth before leaving him dry like Mr. Adams did.  It was almost as if Adams could have kept going for another 50 pages, there was surely enough left to uncover, and enough blood to bathe in one last time.<br />This book is an exciting look into the sociopathic mind, with startling twists and very deeply fathomed characterizations.  If you like sick, and you like twisted, grab a copy of The Sociopath to fill in those gaping wounds in your fleshy bookcase.  Enjoy!	2004-05-31

I picked Veniss Underground up on a recommendation, and am very glad that I did.<br />Overall, it is the story of a man seeking to save his lover, and perhaps also his soul, for he blames himself for her circumstances.<br />On Veniss, the cities are compacted into worlds of their own, each with their own political forces and policing policies; not only above ground, but beneath the world are levels extending far down into the deepest and most despairing depths.<br />The story picks up with Nicholas and Nicola, brother and sister formed in the same vat, birthed and raised together.  Nicholas is an artist and Nicola a civil programmer, so very close when they were young, they were now miles apart both mentally and socially.<br />Shadrach is friend to Nicholas and former lover of Nicola, a large man who used to run supplies across the wastes in-between cities and now has a deep-rooted fear of the Underground.<br />When Nicholas goes missing, Shadrach doesn't give it much thought until he finds that not only is Nicola also missing, but pieces of her have turned up at a rich woman's estate.<br />Shadrach knows that Nicholas was last seen heading for the headquarters of his own mysterious boss, Quinn.  Quinn is the ultimate &quot;Living Artist&quot;, creating brand new lifeforms both useful and hideous.  Nicholas had wanted to purchase a Meerkat from Quinn, in order to protect him from the police who robbed him.<br />Shadrach vows to find Nicola, and kidnaps the head of her former Meerkat to take into the Underground with him on his quest for Nicola, and his drive to hunt down and kill the enigmatic Quinn.<br />What makes Jeff Vandermeer's novel so very intriguing is his tri-view approach to telling his tale.  The first book, Nicholas, is written in first-person perspective.  The second book, Nicola, is written like a dream.  That is, the story is told as if someone were telling you what has happened to you and how you felt about it; almost like hypnotism.  Extremely unique and surreal angle, Vandermeer manages to pull it off.  The third book is told in standard third perspective, as Shadrach descends below Veniss.<br />The city is fantastic, the underground disturbing and deadly, and the monstrous creations roaming the streets and alleys are truly frightening in their grotesqueries.  Mr. Vandermeer's striking vision of the train deep in the depths of the Underworld and the outlandish deeper levels chilled my blood to a comfortably numb state, leaving my eyes widened in shock and my brain reeling with macabre wonder.<br />I will mention that the book is a bit slow to begin, but I urge you to have patience and stick with it, you will not be disappointed in Veniss.

A huge sprawling city, earthlike in its usage of power plants, garbage collection, restaurants, brothels, nightclubs, transportation, streets and alleys; yet Hellish in its brutal and grotesque mockery of these familiar urban scenes.  We were introduced to Cassie and discovered that she is an Etheress, a living human able to walk through hell.<br />In Infernal Angel, Lee continues his tale of Cassie's search for her sister, who is in hell because she committed suicide.  But Lee's mastery of his vision of hell is much, much weaker in Angel; and the characters are more lacking than ever.<br />The story picks up with a couple of short forays into hell with some side characters, which are pretty good, but then go into a lengthy repeat of City Infernal.  This annoyed me, because I have already read the first book.  I find no reason to repeat chapters when a shorter form of &quot;catch-up dialogue&quot; could be used.<br />When we find Cassie again, she is in an asylum for the insane, under psychiatric care.  Here she meets Angelese, an angel from the Order of the Seraphim, called a Caliginaut because they have their wings removed and can descend into Hell as spies.  The addition of Angelese, in my opinion, was a mistake, because I found her flat, two dimensional, and annoying.<br />Believe it or not, you are already 100 pages into the book without really going anywhere.  But we have also just met a second new character, Walter, who is an Etheran, a male version of Cassie, and with him is his own version of a guide from hell called No-Name.  Walter is more fleshed out than Angelese, but still too weak to capture my interest, and No-Name simply equaled No-Interest.<br />You will be at least halfway through the book before Lee takes us back into the streets of the Mephistopolis, but again you will not find the treasure here that was present in City Infernal.  There was no taste, no smell, no underlying currents of slime dripping wetly from severed limbs and broken souls.<br />Instead, it consisted of broken, flash-in-the-pan descriptions and shallow skimmings of moments that perhaps should have been savored, but flew by in too few words; sacrificing substance and style for rapidly fired staccato scenes that never allow us to dive back into the squalor that we wished to live in once again.<br />Angelese and Cassie &quot;nectoport&quot; everywhere, so hell is mostly seen from above with a few touch downs that are brief and overloaded with too many images; going for instant and shallow shock rather than the descriptive &quot;sink your teeth into&quot; grotesqueries available in the first book.<br />The dialogue is flat and lifeless, Cassie does not really grow much, though she does hold a surprise for you, and Angelese was grating on my nerves every step of the way.  Infernal Angel has the look, texture, and taste of a book that was simply produced as padding between City Infernal and a third book.  Nothing is really resolved in Angel.<br />So, if you REALLY liked City Infernal, pick this up used and skim it.  Otherwise, I believe you could wait for the third book and still not miss a lot by skipping this piece of middle-puff.  I'm sorry Edward, but you really are better than this.sent in City Infernal.

Punktown is a diverse colony of outcasts from many different worlds, including the race native to Oasis called the Choom.  &quot;Third Eye&quot; a collection of short stories that take place in Punktown, just like the first book by Thomas.  What is different is that Thomas wrote only one story in this collection, with the rest contributed by other authors.<br />Unfortunately, that is what makes &quot;Third Eye&quot; a four star compared to the five I gave &quot;Punktown&quot;.  Thomas seems to be the only author that had a firm grip on the ideal of the city.  Not to say that the rest of the stories were bad in anyway, they just didn't fit his mold as well, and seemed to be more of a general Sci-Fi connection.<br />The best story in the book is the one Thomas himself wrote, &quot;The Color Shrain&quot;, which isn't really about this particular color that only one alien race can see, but about Specola's unique way of making things disappear and reappear.  Unique and disturbing.<br />Eight more stories follow, featuring tales of sentient robots, a singer who makes the bigtime by leaving her body behind, a Choom detective chasing down a telekinetic alien, a lesson on getting to know your friends better before making a pass at them, and others.<br />I somehow got the feeling that some of the efforts by the other authors were &quot;early career works&quot;, often just a tad disjointed in the flow of the tale; not well cemented and lacking a stylish flow to them.<br />However, over all, the collection is worthwhile; just pick up Punktown first to catch a firm grip of the city before taking this &quot;Third Eye&quot; view of one of my favorite places.

Houarner has created one of the creepiest and most despairing worlds I have ever visited in my lifetime of perusing the written word.<br />Aum is a city banished into isolation even from its own world, as punishment for offending its Gods long ago.  Surrounded by a high wall and covered by perpetual mists, those who dwell here never see sun or stars or moon.  Only the swirling, cold mists.<br />Houarner's descriptions of Aum, with its polluted canals, continual gloom, dank temple cellars, tight and shady streets, and hopeless futility amongst both the locals and the traveler's is the centerpiece of this collection.<br />Aum is also known as the &quot;City of Gates&quot;, for Aum is the center nexus of many portals to uncountable universes.  When a world &quot;aligns&quot; with Aum, a gate will open and you may pass in or out of the city.  Many different worlds align each day at every Gate in the city, and only the Gate Mothers and the GateKeepers know their schedules.  The Gate Mother's are needed to sell you &quot;Aum's Tongue&quot;, a parasite that is swallowed and lodged into your throat in order that you can speak the language of Aum.  Without it, you cannot bargain.  Without bargaining, you cannot live.<br />Aum the city is the constant here, with just the characters changing from chapter to chapter and adventure to adventure; a city painted in such marvelously vivid shades of pale that when Houarner writes of his mists, you can actually feel the sting on your flesh and taste the vaporous tendrils as they float by.  The greed and the despair of its visitors and citizens is so palpable that you can feel your teeth sinking into their very flesh.<br />In the stories we will see a Collector of Delinquent Accounts who must pay the price of her own transgressions, a plague ridden girl bargain for the life of her homeworld with a discontented God, a homeless member of the Bridge-Folk despairingly cast himself at the feet of Gohul The Gondolier, a King from another world finding that his greed will make him powerless, a father suffer from the consequences of abusing his daughter, watch ambition destroy a predatory race, visit a whorehouse, see a tragic play, and most of all...strike a bargain.<br />For in Aum, anything can be bought; love, power, dreams, revenge, or even hope.  But be ready to pay the price, for once your bargain is struck, you are bound to honor it; and the price must always be paid.<br />My favorites of the chapters are the title chapter, Black Orchids From Aum, Shing Of The Bridge Folk, Cure For The Plague, The Collector of Delinquent Accounts, and The Face Of The Messenger.<br />This is truly one of the most chillingly eerie books I have ever come across; not the grossest or the strangest, but one that left an aftertaste in my mouth both delicious and disturbing.  If your taste buds are craving a sample of something creepy and slimy-cold, pick this book up and read.

David was a boy back then, when Meg and Susan Loughlin move in next door with Ruth Chandler and her three sons, after the death of their parents in a car accident that left Meg scarred and Susan crippled.<br />David doesn't mind playing with Ruth's boys, and often found Ruth to be quite pleasant, in that she would treat the boys as adults and even allow them beer at times.  But Ruth had a legendary temper, well known throughout the neighborhood.<br />David is enchanted by Meg, and therefore hangs around more than ever next door, wanting to be near her.  Ruth, unstable before, begins rushing down towards the pits of insanity at a noticeably accelerated pace; and makes the Loughlin girls targets for her anger-infused mania.  Descending from verbal abuse, to overworking Meg at chores, to her final psychotic imprisonment of the two innocent girls, Ketchum's painting of Ruth in the colors of derangement and lunacy is vivid and realistically unsettling.<br />Ruth slowly begins to allow others to join her in terrorizing the girls, and though David is mortified at the scenes unfolding right in front of him, he does nothing and tells no one about Ruth's basement until it is too late.  I will not divulge any further information, but with the story being told from David's viewpoint, you can feel and understand his hesitation and fear, and remember that he himself was still just a child.<br />In this book, you may find yourself wishing that Ketchum was less skilled in his writings, so that you wouldn't find yourself so drawn into the characters and the appalling scenario.  This book will make you angry and sad, leave you feeling helpless in your inability to change the outcome, and that is exactly what you should be feeling.  You will not walk away untouched.  By far, one of the most riveting and revolting horror books I have ever read, well worth the money you spend.realistically unsettling.<br />Ruth slowly begins to allow others to join her in terrorizing the girls, and though David is mortified at the scenes unfolding right in front of him, he does nothing and tells no one about Ruth's basement until it is too late.

This is an older book from 1976, but the references in it are precise and still applicable today.<br />I was reading a &quot;How To&quot; book by one of the Sci-Fi masters when mention was made of this particular little treasure.  I found a nice used copy and have rarely parted with it since.  At 176 pages it is slim and pocketsize, making traveling with a reference easy.<br />It is a dictionary, in dictionary layout with definitions from A to Z, beginning with a one page quick look at which topics have extended definitions; like Alchemy, Devil, Plant Magic, Spiritualism, and Vampire, just to name a few.<br />Beginning with Abaddon (an angel of hell known as the Sovereign Of The Bottomless Pits) to Zombie (which we all know of) this book offers brief but descriptive definitions of all things a horror or fantasy writer could want.  Witchcraft, Yoga, Zodiac, Astrology, The Tarot, The Cabala, Demonology, Magic and Divination, Numerology, Graphology, Phrenology; from the real to the fantastical, the answers and help are right here in this extremely handy reference tool.<br />Know what you are writing about, or just pick up an idea or two to formulate your own monster or your own ritual, whatever your needs you will find this a practical and useful addition to your writing toolkit.	2004-05-13

Especially considering the star studded cast of writers who have participated in its making.<br />Jack Ketchum, Edward Lee, Gerard Houarner, Charlee Jacob, Tom Piccirilli, and more.  Plus the gleeful discovery that the book is autographed by each and every author!  The book starts out with an introduction called &quot;Dead Cat Pimping&quot; by Dead Cat himself.<br />Each chapter beyond that is a separate journey starring Dead Cat, as he finds himself defending a battered woman, meeting a lovely female feline in Chicago, fighting a futuristic battle in Slide, meets and greets a famous kitty named &quot;Socks&quot; and does shady things with it, gets mistaken for a cosmetics test animal, crashes a stuffy cat show, survives an encounter with Frankenpup, misses a dinner of young birds because he had indulged in dead catnip, falls back into hell with Dr. Booty, discovers more hells than his own, teams up with a dead human who was killed by a hooker, chases a dead rat named Jake, and flees from a lovestruck mouse.<br />Dead Cat is full of adventure in this collection of stories, but I found the prose somewhat stifled by the fact that the requirement for writing a story in the book was to use choppy and unstructured sentences.  While adorable and entertaining for a moment, this writing style does tend to get in the way of the Author's real talents.  I believe I would have enjoyed the book more if the choppy, staccato sounding dialogue had been restricted to Dead Cat's thoughts, rather than the entire body of the story.<br />The illustrations by GAK are wonderful (though too few in my opinion), and besides, his name sounds like a cat hacking up a hairball.  GAK.<br />If you like this book, make sure to pick up the sequel to it, called &quot;Dead Cat: Bigger Than Jesus&quot;.  Though a much smaller chapbook, it actually utilizes the structure much better and has new stories that are worthwhile additions to Dead Cat's adventures.  Enjoy!ditions to Dead Cat's adventures.

Every now and then, those of us who indulge in the most gruesome of the horror and science fiction genre must kick back, take a load off, and curl up with a well written and light hearted book that will allow us a chuckle or two.<br />This is the book for that moment.  Relatively short (238 pages) and a very fast read, Moore's tale is not only captivating but will leave you chuckling in morbid humor.  Travis O'Hearn is over ninety years old, but doesn't look a day over twenty five.  This is because of his demon, Catch.  Many years ago Travis unsuspectingly summoned the demon and became his Master, with one of the benefits being perpetual youth and an inability to die.  Of course, the bad part is, Catch is not a nice demon, and Travis is stuck with him.<br />Catch likes to watch TV, read comic books, and ride on the hood of the car; but most of all he likes to eat, and people are his favorite food.  All Travis wants to do is find a way to send Catch back to hell, but he doesn't have a clue as to how to go about it.  The one person who holds the objects that may help him get rid of Catch is a young girl on a train, who Travis lost track seventy years ago without ever learning her name.<br />Which is what brings Travis and Catch to Pine Cove, a sleepy seaside tourist town.  Here in Pine Cove, Moore introduces us to the townspeople; fleshing them out into fully developed personalities that you will either like or dislike, but will certainly not leave you with that dry feeling of a hastily sketched character.  Moore's ability to bring all these different people to life is what makes this book such a fast and fun read; how he manages to bring these characters to life in only a few short paragraphs is the sign of a gifted writer.<br />There is Rachel, the benign witch; Howard, who runs the HP Caf&eacute;; Robert the drunken loser; Mavis, the gnarly tavern owner; Rivera the police sergeant; and a host of others that all add to the flavor of the story.<br />Topping it all off is the arrival of the King of the Djinn, Gian Hen Gian, who looks like a tiny wrinkled old man and spouts the most hilarious of insults to those who peeve him.  The townspeople, Travis, Catch, and the Djinn all collide to bring us a most entertaining and humorous story.  The ending is a flurry of activity, with fantasy and imagination that borders on silly but fits tightly in with the rest of the book.<br />Truly, 'Practical Demon Keeping' is a frivolous and light-hearted romp that is well worth the money spent.

What a great compilation of stories.  Interesting, well written, imaginative, and absorbing; you won't want to leave Punktown once you submerge yourself into its seedy depths.<br />On the planet of Oasis, an Earth established colony is formed called Paxton, but is known to everyone on Oasis as Punktown.  In this colony, people from many different worlds and cultures live crowded into the apartments and streets, the colony overflowing with teeming life forms from the native Choom to the strange L'leweds and Antses and Waiais and of course the Humans.<br />Although each chapter is a separate story, they all blend into each other as a single fully developed tale of the colony itself, and the lives that carry out their existence there.  When I read the first two chapters, I found myself being a little disappointed that they seemed to end rather \\"unfinished\\", like there should have been more wrap up to that particular tale.  But as you read along, this feeling will fade because you realize that the overall concept of the book is that \\"life goes on\\", and you begin to feel the continuum of Punktown itself; as an entity comprised of individuals and not the individuals themselves.<br />My favorite chapter has to be the first one, \\"The Reflections of Ghosts\\", about an artist who clones himself to make artwork out of his creations, twisting the helix here and there to cause mutations according to whatever specs his customers wish.  He calls them \\"Starfish\\" because of their complete lack of intelligence, but his narcissistic captivation with his \\"art\\" will be his downfall.  Wait till you read about his &quot;wall piece&quot;.  Yuck.<br />Next, in \\"The Flaying Season\\", we follow a human woman named Kohl who lives in the Antse part of the neighborhood, and cannot seem to let go of her past even though it has already been erased.<br />\\"Wakizashi\\" is a very strange tale, introducing us to the L'lewed, one of the strangest residents Jeffrey Thomas dreamed up for Punktown.  This chapter gives us a reason to ponder just how far does Tolerance extend when you are dealing with such diverse cultures?<br />\\"Precious Metal\\" is a new look at \\"Man vs Machine\\", a rather interesting tale that would be at home in Asimov's \\"I Robot\\". (Yes, it's that good!)  Mob bosses and a robot jazz band and beautiful women make this tale a tasty and satisfying addition to this collection.<br />\\"Heart For Heart's Sake\\" is a beautiful tale of love conquering both evil, and artistic desires.  Teal has created the perfect piece of art, his best work ever, and his girlfriend Nimbus does the performance art within his creation.  But what price could possibly be worth such a treasure?<br />\\"Face\\" is a different kind of love story; the unconditional love of a parent for their child.  This chapter is not about the conquering power of love, but the gut-wrenching pain that familial love can cause, and just how far one will go to never let go of their love.  Or avenge it.<br />\\"The Palace of Nothingness\\" is a short, futuristic Haunted House story.<br />\\"Immolation\\" is an interesting and sad tale of a \\"Culture\\"; which is a clone specifically created for work.  Would these \\"Cultures\\" have feelings?  Love? Anger? Would there be room in their \\"brain-drip educated\\" minds to feel friendship, affection, or perhaps even seek vengeance?<br />The last chapter in the book, \\"The Library Of Sorrows\\", is about a cop named MacDiaz who has a photographic memory chip installed in his brain.  This proves to be great for solving crimes and tracking killers, but just how many grisly scenes can he handle having total image recall of?  At what point does one grow weary of the carnage?<br />This is the first book I have read of Jeffrey Thomas's, and I must say it is absolutely wonderful.  I loved the world he created, and the different aliens.  His descriptions of the strange beings bring them out into flesh without teetering over into boring repetitiveness orpatronizing \\"you should know what I'm thinking\\" prose.  The characters are well though out, believable, and likeable; and the scenes they wander through flow like mind candy past the eye.  Punktown is a fast read, which is good, because you will want to stay up reading this one.  Enjoy!or patronizing \\"you should know what I'm thinking\\" prose.

The only reason I read this sequel is that I purchased both at the same time.  Actually, I wound out liking this &quot;Death&quot; book better than the first, though it is less about Death and more about living.<br />Death has a little more power in this book, and is not as silly or giddy as before.  Taking the side characters Foxglove and Hazel from &quot;THCOL&quot; and centering on them, this book continues with Foxglove's career taking off at a phenomenal pace.  Hazel's baby Alvie is now born, and Hazel stays at home while Foxglove is out making appearances and records.  On top of which, Foxglove has been advised by her manager not to reveal the nature of her lesbian relationship with Hazel.<br />But unknown to Foxglove, Hazel has made a deal with Death in her attempt to save Alvie's life.  Foxglove is now not only going to have to choose between her family and her career, but also between life and death.<br />Three stars is still as high as I can go for this tale, and that is purely out of respect for Neil Gaimen.  In all honesty, I dislike \\"touchy-feelie\\" books and this one has \\"syrup\\" written all over it, along with more cheesy song lyrics to be subjected to trying to finish the storyline.  Gaimen's other works are much better, and if you like his books and his Sandman series, save these little \\"Death\\" graphic novels for last.  They are not worthy of his other works and should be purchased only to fill in the holes in your collections.	2004-04-19

Along his search and active intentions to kill himself, he discovers a strange family secret about his mother, why she went missing years ago, and the truth about Grandma's traveling, pickup-bed herb garden.<br />Intensely well written, there is subtlety in Ms. Jacob's prose that haunts your mind with the images and thoughts that should be abnormal to the human brain.  Very, very good story.  Enjoy!<br />The second story \\"Growing Out Of It\\" is by Mehitobel Wilson, a talented up-and-coming new writer.  In this dark tale of maturing out of the frivolities of youth, she has imagined a story of a disgusting and intriguing way of getting rid of the irresponsible things we do when youth still blooms within us; those actions that take us from the clubs and nightlife to suits and minivans and eight-to-five jobs.<br />Ted just wants to party with his friends, Meg and Dannyboy, especially after loosing his guitar gig with the band Fister Faster.  Drinking himself into poor health and a wasted state of being, he hardly notices that his skin has been itching a lot, though he notices that Meg has what seems to be a case of ringworm on the back of her neck.<br />Ted winds out bumping into Gary, a guy in smelly dreadlocks who is looking for a guitarist for their new band; and while Ted contemplates the offer, Meg grows strangely insulting towards him and Dannyboy.<br />Ted's drinking escalates to the point where he hallucinated vomiting up body parts; or are these hallucinations real?  Did he really wake up in a pool of gummy stuff on his couch, did he really vomit up a tongue?  What is happening to him, and why has Meg and Dannyboy begun acting so particularly?  Don't miss out on this creepy tale of purging the past in order to move into the future; a future so bright you'll have to wear shades.<br />Also, I recommend taking the time to read the brief bios of these two talented authors at the end, and watch for more to come from these rising masters of the horror genre.

George Whitman gather in an old church in East Bromwich, England with a team of paranormals, determined to discover what it is the Nazis are up to.<br />The Sorcerer, wearing some odd apparatus on his arms, powered by an electrical generator, casts a spell from a rocky hilltop resembling Stonehenge.  A bolt of lightening-type power issues from the rod he holds in his hand, and strikes the church where the rangers are gathered along with their special forces.  When the smoke and debris clear, a small being is hunched down on the floors, looking as though he were part demon and part little boy.  It is Trevor Bruttenholm who names him:  Hellboy.<br />Skipping many years into the future, Hellboy comes to visit Trevor, now an old man.  Trevor, who had been like a father to Hellboy all these years, tells Hellboy of the failed \\"Cavendish Expedition\\" he has just recently returned from, way up in the Artic Mountains.  He and the Cavendish \\"Boys\\" had found some ruins high up in the frozen cliffs, older than old, and inside beneath a mammoth carved pillar is a statue of a sitting man so perfect it seemed to be alive.<br />But Trevor has no further memory of what happened, though the Cavendish brothers did not return with him.  During Trevor's narration of the expedition, Hellboy notices that Trevor's house is infested with frogs.  When Hellboy mentions the frogs, Trevor freaks out and backs away from the frogs, out onto his balcony, from where he is suddenly and unceremoniously tossed back into the room at Hellboy's feet; quite dead.  His body seems to be covered in odd marks that were not there mere seconds ago.<br />Hellboy brings in his friends to help him investigate the death of Trevor; Elizabeth Sherman and Dr. Abraham Sapien.  Liz has highly advanced pyrotechnic abilities, and Abe...well, Abe is a really cool fish-man.  Beginning their investigation at the old Cavendish mansion, which is slowing sinking back into the lake it was built over, the three friends are quickly separated and all hell breaks loose; pun intended.  The nameless Sorcerer who originally summoned Hellboy is back to claim what he believes is his, but by now we know that Hellboy can't be forced to do anything he doesn't want to do.<br />This first Hellboy book reveals Hellboy's origin, and shows us the loyalty between him and his friends, and the lengths they will go to for each other.  This was actually a very difficult review for me to write because I liked it so much, it is hard to describe in a non-gushing way just how much I enjoyed this book.  The storyline is very intense and fast-paced, even for a graphic novel; the illustrations are superb, the cells formed and drawn just right, so that the eye follows the flow of Mignola's inspired tale of this devilishly good guy without staggering or stopping to search for the correct sequence.<br />I have only recently become immersed in the world of graphic novels, and Hellboy is the absolute cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the lot.  A brand new type of hero; ultra powerful, intelligent, witty humor and saucy quips, demonic appearance, and as icing on the cake, from Hell itself.<br />As a bonus, there are some added chapters at the back of the book that illustrate the evolution of Hellboy as he was created and drawn to life, plus some enjoyable Hellboy artwork to examine and appreciate.<br />Hellboy is a perfect graphic novel, and I am greedily looking forward to pouring over the rest of the series.  Not to mention I'm dying to go see the movie now.  Enjoy!!Abe is a really cool fish-man.

The story begins in an alley where Mad Hattie is searching for her heart, and quickly moves to an urban apartment where fifteen year old Sexton Furnival lives with his \\"slightly off\\" mother Sylvia, an aging Earth Mother type.<br />Sexton is sitting at his computer typing out his suicide note when his mother obliviously sends him out for the afternoon because she has taken the day off to spring clean their apartment.  When he literally falls into a garbage dump, he meets a cute and saucy Goth girl named Didi, not knowing that she is Death walking in flesh for a day.  She takes Sexton back to her apartment to mend her torn jeans, and now the story begins its long slide downhill.<br />Mad Hattie confronts Death and threatens to cut off Sexton's nose if Didi (Death) does not go out to find her missing heart.  So Didi and Sexton set off into the city at night, to have some fun and search for Mad Hattie's heart.  And unexplained thread unravels as Didi (Death) continually is offered free goods by kind people.  I didn't get it, and Gaimen never explained it.  They go into a \\"hot\\" club (for free), and once inside with them, we are subjected to some extremely cheesy lyrics sung by lesbian acoustical guitarist.<br />Outside the club, a strange blind man and his minion do unexplained things to find Didi in the club, and when the minion lures them out, Death follows as bovinely as a cow does into the slaughtering pens.  It gets worse.  Once Sexton and Didi are trapped in the cellar, the story becomes even more aimless, filled with pointless conversations which all build up to a ridiculous and anticlimactic ending.<br />For me, Death lost her charm as Didi when she became so naively helpless and stupifyingly  frivolous in her actions and speech.  I was interested in Death presented as a charming Goth girl, but I expected her to have more power, more intelligence, more drive, and something more to say.  Oh, and I have never met a Goth girl who babbled like a Valley girl...another disappointment.<br />To top off my disgust, this unsatisfying story is followed by a brutally inane short in which Didi (Death) lectures us on condom usage.  I never thought that I would be subjected to a cartoon character putting a condom onto a cartoon banana, but it happened and I shudder every time I think of it.<br />I love stories of Death, and if you do too, I would caution you to glance through this particular graphic novel in the bookstore before laying your hard earned cash down on the table.  This was very disappointing.disappointment.  <br />To top off my disgust, this unsatisfying story is followed by a brutally inane short in which Didi (Death) lectures us on condom usage.

US	52859935	RDWP4IJQ5PATO	156971620X	281705464	Harlequin Valentine	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	A flighty story of love and longing, mime and mystery style	Based on the old mime shows, Gaimen has written a fickle and fun tale of love and hearts given freely; of yearning for the affection we all crave, and how we are sometimes oblivious to those who love us the most.<br />Told in the first person by Harlequin himself, he leads us through the giving of his heart, literally, to his beloved Columbine.  Dancing across the pages, flitting through the city as he follows Missy, meeting up with his modern day cast of characters: Columbine, Peirrot, the Doctor, Pulcinella, Pantaloon, and others.<br />Gaimen has a particular talent with Graphic Novellas in that he manages to tell a rich, lush tale with only a few words.  Harlequin Valentine is one of his better works, with artist John Bolton bringing Gaimen's story to life, animating it with sharp photographic quality characters cavorting in stark relief against fuzzy and uncertain backgrounds.  This style of art work really brought Harlequin and Missy and the others directly to the center of our attention, keeping the focus on the characters despite the few words, and smoothing the flow of the tale to read like silken thoughts of love.<br />At the end of the story, Gaimen adds a short piece with a terrific explanation and glossary of the Harlequinade and its characters; which for those like me who are uneducated in older forms of theatrical art is a real bonus to the book.  Also added as a tasty treat is a little tale called \\"Drawn in Darkness\\" that Gaimen added about artist John Bolton.<br />If you like Graphic Novels that have a softer, more playful side, you will love this particular Gaimen.  Enjoy!	2004-04-18

Actually, this is only a 3 ½ star book, but Ito gets the benefit of the doubt.  The stories themselves are wonderfully gruesome and creepy, but its painfully obvious that this is an earlier effort of Ito's, lacking the polish that the Uzumaki series had.<br />The drawings are plainer, and the dialogue is pretty stilted with occasional yawning gaps in it, but the stories are well worth the effort of journeying through.<br />In the first story, \\"Long Hair In The Attic\\", we learn a lesson of asking people to appear in a different way, and succumbing to another's desires of what they think we should be.<br />\\"Approval\\" is a tasty piece of undying love, and a valuable lesson in when to let go of that love.<br />\\"Beehive\\" is my least favorite, a strange story of a strange boy who has a symbiotic relationship to bees and wasps.<br />\\"Dying Young\\", one of my favorites, tells a tale of ugly girls who suddenly grow pretty, and the cost of such a miracle to their lives.<br />\\"Headless Sculptures\\", another favorite, shows what happens when a man's artwork becomes more than realistic.<br />And lastly, \\"Flesh Colored Horror\\", is truly the most horrifying story of all, because it shows the horrid lengths a woman will go through to maintain her beauty, even at the cost of abusing her very own child.<br />A great collection, just be aware that when this book was done, Ito was merely warming up to his full talents.

Of the three Uzumaki volumes, this would be my least favorite.  Having said that, if you have not read Vol. 1 &amp; 2 yet, go pick them up and read them before continuing with this review.<br />Starting out with a great chapter called &quot;The House&quot;, Kirie and her family are directed to one of the older, decrepit row houses to live in after the destruction of their home in the hurricane.  But it is obviously an unclean home, for they all soon develop strange spiral shaped growths.<br />All the subsequent chapters seemed to all blend into one longer finishing story; a sort of downward...spiral...to the culmination of the town's fate.  While things get stranger and the spirals squeeze the town even tighter into their deadly coils, I found the momentum of the storyline slowing down considerably, even though Ito goes way out into left field with whirlwind riders and weird time-phasing.  To me, this felt more like grasping at straws than coming up with some of the ingenious manifestations of spirals that he dreamed up in Vol 1 &amp; 2.<br />While I find the building of the spiral's invasion on a grand scale intriguing, and the fact that no one could leave the city or enter into the spiral useful, I was just left with the feeling that these problems could have been told in a more interesting fashion.  Even with twisted, writhing bodies being my cup of tea, this aspect of the story seemed to occur suddenly and go nowhere while silly things like whirlwind riding was explored in its place.  And the ending, while meant to be grand, left me feeling flat and a little cheated in that it did not elaborate and share more of the mystical discoveries Kirie and Shuicho &quot;fall into&quot;.<br />Still, its worth picking up to complete the set, and I guarantee that when you next find snails in your backyard, you will fling them as far from you as possible.

I sure am glad I didn't give up on the series!<br />An introduction by GH covers a humorous conversation between Dead Cat and God, in which Dead Cat defends the title of his book.<br />The first story, \\"Bad Denny &amp; Dead Cat\\" is the first chapter ever written by Gak.  In it, a mischievous little boy named Denny trips over Dead Cat, and winds out taking him first to a tea party, and then out for some ice cream.<br />The second story, \\"Dead Cat's Secret Of Eternal Life\\" is written by GH, and follows along with Dead Cat as agents of a Pharmaceutical company kidnap him so that they can dissect him and find out the secret to Dead Cat's immortality.  But before they can find out what makes him tick, he is snatched again by a man named Ron from the Protection Of Experimental Animals Agency and taken to Carrie Quinn's house for safekeeping.  Except Carrie has no idea who Ron is, and only wants to watch Buffie The Vampire Slayer without interruption.  But things go wrong when the Company's agents show up to claim their Dead Cat prize, and Carrie kicks their hinders with her kickboxing techniques earning their wrath, and the ultimate praise from Dead Cat, \\"Dead Two-legs know how to throw party.  She Party Animal!\\"<br />The third and last installment in this chapbook is \\"Black Cat Walking On Halloween\\" by GH.  In Black Cat, the God Bast, who had once sent Dead Cat off on a mission to deliver the message \\"Eat Sand\\", has returned to Earth in the form of a female black cat; just out for a stroll to see what has become of the world and what he has missed, but most of all to find out why Humans abandoned him.<br />Bast meets up with Dead Cat and recognizes that Dead Cat is a kindred spirit to him, and so strikes up a conversation with Dead Cat, telling him of his desires.  So Dead Cat takes Bast on an eventful romp through the city on Halloween Eve, and helps the dejected God find what he was looking for.<br />One of the reasons I liked this chapbook better than Dead Cats Bouncing is the fact that the single-word-sentences and oddball, half-hidden descriptions were kept to a minimum, allowing the stories to flow much better.  It's charming for a short while to have Dead Cat's thoughts come out in single word spatters, but an entire chapter written that way becomes confusing, and the author's point is often lost due to lack of adequate content; substance sacrificed for style, in other words.<br />This is a fun, fast, light read that adds the needed depth to the continuation of Dead Cats Bouncing, and is well worth the price of picking up.

Stranger and stranger things begin to happen, proving to Kirie Goshima that her boyfriend Shuichi Saito is right about the town; it is infected with spirals.<br />With the chapters being a little more separated in this second volume, we have some very distinct adventures to wade through.  First is a boy named Mitsuru who likes to &quot;pop up&quot; unexpectedly, earning him the nickname of Jack-In-The-Box.  He develops a crush on Kirie, and goes out of his way to prove his love for her...and directly into the way of an oncoming car.  He must really care for her, for even death cannot stop him from popping up to surprise Kirie.<br />In &quot;The Snail&quot; (my favorite story) a terminally slow boy comes to school only when it rains, and proves that if you are too slow, the spiral will catch up to you.<br />&quot;The Black Lighthouse&quot; tells of the sudden re-occurrence of light issuing forth from the previously abandoned lighthouse, but this is no ordinary light.  Brighter and burning hot, it blazes out from the lighthouse in a twisted spiral of intense illumination.<br />&quot;The Mosquitoes&quot; and &quot;The Umbilical Cord&quot; do pretty much flow together.  When Kirie is hospitalized after her incident at the lighthouse, she discovers the hypnotic effects of the lazily swirling mosquitoes that are infesting the town, and the odd behavior of the pregnant women who emulate them, including her cousin Keiko.  When the babies are born, odd mushrooms and a strange doctor come into play, along with some of Junji Ito's more graphic illustrations.<br />The last piece, &quot;The Storm&quot;, tells of a hurricane that sweeps over Kurozu-cho...and then sticks around for awhile.  This chapter was particularly creepy in illustrating the extent to which this storm stretches itself in its search for none other than Kirie herself.  Very weird.<br />Also mentionable is a funny &quot;Afterward&quot; depicting Ito's search for the secret of the spiral.<br />A great, and definitely more graphic, sequel to Vol. 1, Spiral Into Horror is a fast and absorbing read for even those who do not normally delve into Japanese Animation or graphic novels.

Having only recently been turned on to Brian Lumley, this is my first purchase and first read of Lumley; and all I can say is Wow!  His writing phases from ethereal to direct impact, flowing with style and a flair for the creepy things that go squish in the night.<br />Beginning with the best story of the collection, \\"Fruiting Bodies\\", Lumley takes us on a trip through a small, dying town that is slowly falling into the sea.  But will the sea claim its victim before the Dry Rot does?  Seemingly, a new and mutated type of dry rot, it is as hungry as the sea.  Lumley does not deny the imagination in this tale, leaving you searching the nooks and crannies of your house for any...well...nasty accumulations.<br />\\"The Man Who Photographed Beardsley\\" is a short but sweet sabbatical into a demented and twisted mind, which has managed to retain its sense of propriety.<br />\\"The Man Who Felt Pain\\" is a tale told by the protagonist, of his twin brother and the bond they shared, through life and death.  If one twin suffers, will not the other twin feel his pain...sooner or later?<br />\\"The Viaduct\\" reminds me of Stephen King back when he still had tight and compelling stories with real-life characters you could relate to immediately.  Children can be cruel, but just where is the line drawn when one doesn't understand the rules?  This is an excellent story, in which I could actually feel the desperation and the slippery palms of true terror.<br />\\"Recognition\\" is a ghostly tale of a haunted place, and a firm argument as to why some things are best left alone.<br />\\"No Way Home\\" is a surreal nighttime journey through both familiar and unfamiliar territory, with a surprise ending that is unexpected...and worth the trip.<br />\\"The Pit-Yakker\\" takes us back in time to a simpler life within a working-man's village, and a young man's dreams that turn to dust and disintegration in the wake of simple urges and the lack of intelligence to quench them.  Questions of friendship and tolerance and personal limitations are addressed here, in a harsh and unforgiving atmosphere of betrayal and lust.<br />\\"The Mirror of Nitocris\\" was one of the stories I found to be a bit boring, kind of strung out and lacking, even though it is only 10 pages long.  It was just a bit of a yawn in all the rest of the excitement; a tale of an acquired artifact that comes into being in a chilling climax, only to be destroyed before it can leash its evil into the world.<br />\\"Necros\\" is a very interesting tale of immortality, and the things one must do in order to assure that immortality is youthful and pleasant.  But there is a twist to this at the end that will surprise you, and give you a peek into the horrific aspects of bowing to such a creature.<br />\\"The Thin People\\" is a true masterpiece of the type of horror that will leave you forever guessing about ordinary things you see every day.  I am counting the lamp posts on my street now, and have had a few disturbing dreams in regards to the science of \\"Folding\\".  Excellent tale!<br />\\"The Cypress Shell\\" and \\"The Deep Sea Conch\\" are intertwined stories, based on letters written from one person to another.  The tales they tell of mysterious mollusks are frightening and disgusting, and well deserve their place here in this anthology.  The creepiness Lumley portrays upon something as simple as shellfish is amazing, and you will never eat clams or muscles in the same uncaring fashion as you once did before this unnerving description of these innocent organisms.<br />Lastly is \\"Born of the Winds\\", the longest story in the collection, and a novella in its own right.  Although, it was my least favorite of all the set.  A meteorologist recovering from an \\"incident\\" of chest discomfort visits his friend in Navissa, Manitoba.  While recuperating from his complaint within the house of his friend, he meets the widow of Samuel Bridgeman, an anthropology professor who had died nearby some years ago.  Our protagonist becomes interested in Bridgeman's written works, and eventually becomes involved in Mrs. Bridgeman's search for her son, Kirby.  How deep is the Bridgeman's connection with the Air Elementals and the Wind Walkers, and where does Kirby fit in with these spirits?  Not a bad story, just a little too wordy and..well...coy, for my tastes.<br />Don't miss this fantastic collection of stories from Lumley, a true master of mysterious and weird stories that are well written and well told.

I will never look at anything with a spiral the same way ever again.<br />Ito has created a great story, even for someone like myself who is not a fan of Japanese animation, and also a beginner in the wide world of graphic novels and chapter books. (or grown up comic books if you prefer that term)<br />The stories are told from the prospective of a young girl named Kirie Goshima who lives in the town of Kurozu, along with her boyfriend Shuichi Saito.  The first two chapters deal with the tragic deaths of Shuichi's parents, his father dying from turning himself into a spiral, and his mother from trying to rid her body of spirals. (Think fingerprints and the cochlea in the inner ear for starters)<br />Shuichi is convinced that their town is infected with spirals, which is seemingly proven by the odd patterns in the river and the fact that every time a body is cremated, the smoke belches out from the smokestack in a spiral pattern that covers the town before falling into mysterious Dragonfly Pond.  After the deaths of his parents, he quits school and becomes a recluse, popping out only in time to save Kirie from one spiral or another.<br />In the remaining chapters, we meet Azami Kurotani, a beautiful girl who has never been turned away by a boy since she received a crescent shaped scar upon her forehead.  But when Shuichi turns her away, Azami becomes fixated on him, and falls victim to the spiral.<br />Then Kirie's father, a potter, begins to notice changes in the way his clay behaves when fired in the kiln.  His everyday plates and bowls begin to twist and warp into unusable shapes, and he becomes transfixed by his work until Shuichi realizes what is happening and steps in to help Kirie.<br />Next is a love story of two youths whose poverty stricken parents have declared war on each other, and refuse to allow the young lovers to see each other.  Just as the spiral seems to twist in upon itself forever, so does unrequited love writhe about the hearts of Yoriko and Kazunori.<br />In the last chapter, the spiral steps it up a notch and enters the realm of the truly bizarre, when Kirie discovers that her own hair has been infected, and begins a life of its own.  Surprisingly, this causes her friend Sekino to become jealous of the attention Kirie is getting from being led around by her hair.  Some people will do anything for attention, and Sekino finds a way to compete with Kirie while Shuichi tries to find a way to save her.<br />I found this volume to be extrodinaryly entertaining, and am already buried deep within Volume Two.  With the subtle horror and fast paced storyline, these books are a great read for young adults and old adults alike.<br />A simply fascinating study of how a mundane pattern can awaken from non-existence and possess an entire town, this is definately an entertaining \\"Food For Thought\\" piece that will cause you to wake up and take notice of all the patterns within your own life.  Quite enjoyable, all in all.  :o)ts of Yoriko and Kazunori.<br />In the last chapter, the spiral steps it up a notch and enters the realm of the truly bizarre, when Kirie discovers that her own hair has been infected, and begins a life of its own.

Probably one of Lee's most disgusting works to date.<br />The first of the duet is Edward Lee's \\"Mother\\", a truly repulsive story of  Smith, Coroner in a picturesque small town.  He has a plain-looking wife whom he loves named Marie, and a precocious seven-year-old daughter named Jeannie.  Smith loves to bird watch, except the bird he watches the most is his neighbor's college aged daughter Donna, spying on her through his binoculars while she sunbathes.<br />Then one day as he is \\"bird watching\\" he sees his daughter running down the wooded ravine by his house towards a mysterious red and white barrel.  Suddenly frightened, knowing that the barrel contained some kind of chemical waste, he chases after Jeannie and orders her not to go near the drum.<br />He should have listened to his own words, for when Smith pokes at the drum's lid, it pops off and releases a brown, foul smelling ooze into the dry creek bed.  After reporting the dumped waste to the authorities, Smith spends an uncomfortable night dreaming of his wife, neighbor Donna, and daughter involved in an erotic romp through the spilled sludge.<br />Then things really get weird when the women's behavior changes, and his daughter seems to know something about the waste that escapes Smith, giving him odd instructions in regards to The Mother and The Father.  What is this sludge?  Was the dream real?  What will happen to the women, and will his daughter know what to do?<br />Although the length of the story wasn't great enough for any of the characters to fully develop, Lee still manages to pen a repugnant and satisfyingly gruesome tale of love and toxic waste that is not to be missed by any true Lee fans.<br />The second piece of the duet is \\"Bitchfight\\" by Patrick  Lestewka.  In a future world of television saturated by \\"Reality\\" shows, the competition is fierce enough to take the games one step further; to the death.  Shows are emerging in which contestants are injected with a deadly virus and given 24 hours to find the antidote, or locked into sensory deprivation chambers for years, or tortured in order to see which is the last to survive.  A brutal world with brutal entertainment.<br />Pandora Murphy is a \\"Bitchfighter\\", as she calls it, and in a world where welfare no longer exists she fights for a living in order to support herself and her daughter Piquette.  The \\"Bitchfights\\" have three tier levels; Stock, Mod, and Super-Mod.  Pandora is a Stock fighter, unaltered except in the simplest forms; knuckle inserts, ankle spurs, elbow domes, and the likes.  Mods have undergone neurosurgery in order to speed up their reaction time to lightening speeds, block pain receptors, and increase adrenaline levels.  Super-Mods are the class of \\"anything goes\\", where the women literally become cybernetically designed machines of destruction.<br />After a successful fight, Pandora is sitting around drinking beer with her trainer, Ezekiel Jackson, when a limo pulls up next to them and a talent scout named Casey Forbes steps out and makes Pandora an offer.<br />He will pay for her to become a surgically enhanced Mod, giving her a break into Primetime.  After promising her that she would be fighting only other newbies and not the all time champion Jasmine Conner, Pandora agrees to his proposal against Jackson's wishes.<br />But this is a world of brutality, disease, corruption...and betrayal.  Lestewka's tale is definitely worthy to be included with Lee's; a very dark and miserable look into a future that holds nothing sacred, and yet he has infused it with the tenderest love of all; that between a mother and her child.<br />Definitely worth the price to pick up this small book, there are only 400 signed and numbered paperbacks available.

After all, Fairy tales used to be a bit brutal in their own right, and taking away all of the blood and violence in order to conform to today's &quot;Politically Correct&quot; standards also takes away from the lesson to be learned.  IMHO.<br />This tale is told with a simple exuberance, yet manages to hold up under the scrutiny of all us die hard Neil Gaiman fans, showing us that he has the talent to lead us along gentler slopes of the same deadly peaks and chasms he has taken us to in his other works.  His playfulness shows through in Stardust as a novel, the way his chapbooks \\"Wolves In The Walls\\" and \\"The Day I Swapped My Dad For 2 Goldfish\\" did with his graphic novels.<br />Tristin Thorn lives in the English town of Wall, right next to, well, the Wall.  There is only one way through the Wall, a gap which is constantly guarded by the village folk of Wall; not to keep people from coming in, but to keep the inhabitants of Wall from crossing over into the land of Faerie.  Once every nine years there is a huge fair within the field beyond the gap, and only then do the peoples from each of the lands mingle.  Tristin is not aware that half of his lineage is from across the Wall, and when the day comes that he watches a falling star with the girl he wishes to marry, and promises to bring her back that very same star, his father Dunstan helps him to cross the gap into Faerie.<br />Over in Faerie, it is time for the Lord of Stormhold to die, and pass along his Reign to one of his sons.  Unable to determine which of his surviving sons is worthy, the old Lord tosses the Power of Stormhold (a topaz set in an amulet) up into the air and tells his sons that whoever finds the amulet will rule after him.  This won't be easy for the offspring of the old Lord, for already four of his seven sons were dead, killed off by the living brothers in order to eliminate their claim to Stormhold.<br />Also in Faerie live the Lilim, three ancient women who have lived on and on for forever, revitalizing their youth by eating the hearts from fallen stars.  When the star falls, one of the ancient crones makes herself young again and sets out after the star.<br />Tristin is helped along in his quest by some, and treated rudely by others, but always manages to get along by determination and, surprisingly, innocence.  When he is transported by a magic candle to where the star had fallen, he is shocked to see that the Fallen Star is a girl, and she has a broken leg to boot.<br />The adventures of Tristin in his journey back to The Wall and the market within the field are magical, fantastical, and sometimes just a tiny bit scary.  Though the plot really does have a transparent ending, it still does not take away from the total enjoyment of Tristin's adventures and the predicaments he falls in and out of.  All of the main characters coalesce in the ending, but the side characters we meet along the way are just as fleshed out and real to me as Tristin, Yvaine the Star, and Madame Semele with her mysterious bird.<br />Go ahead and step through the Gap with Tristin, you won't be sorry you tagged along.  Enjoy!This won't be easy for the offspring of the old Lord, for already four of his seven sons were dead, killed off by the living brothers in order to eliminate their claim to Stormhold.<br />Also in Faerie live the Lilim, three ancient women who have lived on and on for forever, revitalizing their youth by eating the hearts from fallen stars.  When the star falls, one of the ancient crones makes herself young again and sets out after the star.<br />Tristin is helped along in his quest by some, and treated rudely by others, but always manages to get along by determination and, surprisingly, innocence.  When he is transported by a magic candle to where the star had fallen, he is shocked to see that the Fallen Star is a girl, and she has a broken leg to boot.<br />The adventures of Tristin in his journey back to The Wall and the market within the field are magical, fantastical, and sometimes just a tiny bit scary.  Though the plot really does have a transparent ending, it still does not take away from the total enjoyment of Tristin's adventures and the predicaments he falls in and out of.  All of the main characters coalesce in the ending, but the side characters we meet along the way are just as fleshed out and real to me as Tristin, Yvaine the Star, and Madame Semele with her mysterious bird.<br />Go ahead and step through the Gap with Tristin, you won't be sorry you tagged along.

A fantastic and enlivening respite from long, lengthy novels, this is a great book to travel with you or to keep beside your bed for a nice short story before bedtime; fully packed with stories that are sure to give your dreams a writhing twist of delectation.  Some of the best horror writer's work can be found between the pages of this anthology, spanning from early works written in the 20's to more modern tales.<br />Don't let the title scare you away, none of the stories are very explicit in either the sex or the horror area, it is more an imaginative collection geared towards the strange, and relationships, and often strange relationships, coupled with a bit of gore and sex.<br />Stephen King has a lovely piece in this compilation, written back in 1986 before he contracted diarrhea of the mouth and pen, called \\"The Revelations of Becka Paulson\\" about a woman who is cleaning out her husbands things, and his .22 gun goes off and shoots her in the head.  She wakes up on the floor, and has no idea how she got the hole in her forehead, but strange things begin to happen when the picture of Jesus sitting atop their TV begins talking to her.<br />Robert Aickman, master of the ethereal glimpse through the horror mirror, has a strange tale of \\"boy meets girl\\", inside a sideshow tent in a traveling carnival.  Patrick McGrath has a lovely little piece that ponders whether people who see vampires are mad.<br />Thomas Disch writes of a despondent girl's appointment with Death himself; Stephen Donaldson's The Conqueror Worm involves a marital spat interrupted by the odd appearance of a malevolent centipede, and Clive Barker has included a masterpiece called Jaqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament.<br />Other notable mentions are Carolyn Banks \\"Salon Satin\\", Angela Carter's \\"Master\\", Christopher Fowler's \\"The Master Builder\\", and May Sinclair's \\"The Villa Desiree\\".<br />Unlike a lot of anthologies where you need to pick through the bad stories to get to the good ones, there was only one story in this entire collection that I mildly disliked.  Truly a great effort by Michele Slung in her obvious pickiness at gathering the shorts, this is an all around great book to own and pack around with you.

This is a continuing story, and I very much recommend that you start with the first book, Stardoc, and read the sequels in order: Stardoc, Beyond Vallarean, Endurance, then Shockball. If you haven't, the rest of this review will contain spoilers for the first four.<br />Contrary to what a lot of other readers seem to think, I believe that Eternity Row has brought Cherijo back into her groove.<br />In this Fifth installment of the StarDoc series, Cherijo Grey-Veil is back on board The Sunlace with her husband/linguist Duncan Reever, and their new child Marel.  With them on the huge HouseClan Torin ship are their two tag-alongs from Shockball; Hawk Long Knife, a Terran/Taercal halfbreed, and Dhreen, an Oenrallian who is Cherijo's former-friend and recent betrayer.<br /><br />Eternity row starts with HouseClan Torin decreeing that they will no longer turn their backs on their enemies, and have outfitted The Sunlace for war, willing to declare ClanKill on any who attack.  Being upset enough about this, Cherijo goes to visit Dhreen and accidentally shoots him, causing a grievous injury.  When Dhreen wakes from his surgery, he has trauma induced global amnesia.  And everywhere Cherijo goes, she is now followed by the suspicious new psychiatric resident Qonja, cousin to Clan Torin.<br />Eternity Row is packed with more adventure than the third and fourth books, which bogged down a little on the war between the League and the Hsktskt.  Although The Sunlace rescues some ships disabled and floating with both League and Hsktskt survivors, Cherijo treats them aboard the Sunlace until they can be offloaded, and thankfully does not return to this in this installment.<br />Instead, they head for Hawk's home world of Taerca hoping that he can locate his father.  What they find is an openly hostile race of dying people, living under strict religious standards.  It's trouble on Taerca, and trouble after the leave the planet when Squilyp's mail order bride from Omorr arrives, a haughty little thing who immediately begins to push around the big Jorenians.  Trouble waits for Cherijo still when they arrive at Dhreen's home world of Orenrall, where things are not what they seem to be.  Orenrall is hiding a horrible secret from the universe, and its up to Dhreen to remember it before the Bartermen sell them all as slaves.<br />Eternity Row is back on the 5 star list along with books 1 and 2 in the series, recapturing the excitement, bizarre worlds and species, and helter-skelter race against life and death that Cherijo always gets herself tangled into.  Strange planets, purple moulds, feline deities, squishy worms, planetary drug addictions, the strange ClanCousin Qonja watching her every move, and a racial struggle for death rather than life all will plant themselves in Cherijo's path and force her to confront them.<br />What I really liked about this installment in the series is that they put aside the war for a while to concentrate on bringing back the more sci-fi elements of the series.  I like the books better when Cherijo and Duncan get along, their squabbling can get tiresome at times.  And I love the places and Beings that S.L.Veihl can dream up, and was getting tired of the Hsktskt/League conflict.<br />The worst and most annoying thing about this installment is the baby talk that Marel speaks.  Okay, I know she is supposed to be a precocious child, but I dearly hope that her speech is better in the next StarDoc book.  And Ms. Veihl, you had better be working on it now, because I can't wait to take off again with Cherijo on her adventures. Enjoy.little thing who immediately begins to push around the big Jorenians.

US	52859935	R1GNBSGNKFVJKQ	0930289552	93409299	Black Orchid	Books	4	32	36	N	Y	Black Orchid caused my love of Graphic Novels to bloom!	I am not a DC comic fan or collector, so please bear with me in giving you this review from a non-comic owner perspective.<br />While not a follower of the comics, I do love Neil Gaiman.  This is the story of how Black Orchid comes to life and seeks out a meaning for, literally, the life given to her.  She wants answers to the questions &quot;Who am I? Why am I here?&quot; and is desperate to find a place that she will belong.<br />Her tale is told with cameo appearances by Batman, Swamp Thing, and Poison Ivy; and you should not miss the nightmarish visit to the Arkham Asylum where a skeletal, sleepless man spills his nightmares on the floor, and the x-ray man weeps burning tears onto the floor.<br />She awakens as the Black Orchid in the greenhouse at Dr. Phillip Sylvian, with the memories of a woman named Susan Linden.  Phil tells her about a little of her background, and tells her of those who he went to college with, without whom she would not be alive; Dr. Jason Woodrue, Pamela Isley and Alec Holland.<br />But before he can reveal everything to her, Phil is killed and the Black Orchid is on her own.  Her ex husband Carl Thorne finds out about her plant-reincarnation, and makes a visit to her, killing all but one of the smaller plants that Phil has been nurturing.  Black Orchid takes the little one with her, &quot;Suzy&quot;, to Gotham city where a tip from a friend sends her off along to Arkham Asylum to speak with Poison Ivy.  Suzy is snatched by Lexcorp, but after a quick visit with Swamp Thing, Black Orchid rescues Suzy and they fly off to the Amazon Rainforest where Black Orchid can plant her seeds.<br />But there are still those who hunt her down; her ex husband who is trying to kill her again, and the Lexcorp minions sent into the rainforest to bring her back alive so that she can be dissected.  What a girl...er...plant, to do?<br />Brief comic strip type prose does not stop Gaiman from bringing to life a fully fleshed out story, and the artwork of Dave McKean is to be applauded.  Moving from shades of gray to brilliantly splashed pages of vibrant color, he paints brutality, horror, and the sereneness of nature in the same ethereal fashion. This is an excellent choice for those who are just starting to dip their toes and get their feet wet in the world of Graphic Novels.  Enjoy!ve McKean is to be applauded.

No real violence or threatening situations, merely a vaguely distorted view of some old puppets.<br />The prose is good, but rather pointless; the artwork is good and strangely done, but when put together to form the whole it came out rather unfulfilling and anticlimactic.  A rather generic musing of a mundane summer.<br />If you have everything else by Neil Gaiman, then go ahead and fill up your collection with Mr. Punch, but this is not a good place to start to introduce yourself to Gaiman, and not recommended unless you are a die hard fan.<br />Pick up one of his novels first, or his Sandman series or Black Orchid which was beautifully done.	2004-03-07
US	52859935	R2Y0ZJ69J4MMTN	0671695754	157530000	Deathport	Books	3	2	3	N	Y	Needs to fly a bit higher to meet my expectations	I really do love to read these compositions from Horror Writers Of America, taking a theme like vampires or a freak show to showcase the talents of the many contributor's chapters and stories.  Deathport is a group of individual, stand-alone chapters that all center around the Dry Plains International Airport and the people who travel through it and work there.<br />There is something horribly wrong in this airport, which was built over the sacred Indian grounds, going back further even than the Comanche's who still live there to the Aztec Indians who once roamed the plains.  An ancient and sinister evil lurks here, and has lied dormant long enough.  It's time is now.<br />The stories pretty much center around workers at the airport discovering horrid visions in bathroom mirrors, and travelers stranded in the malevolent concourses waiting for planes that cannot take off.  I personally was hoping for more actual flight stories, and planes turning evil to swallow unsuspecting passengers, and therefore felt a little let down when none surfaced.  Being afraid of flying, I thought that this collection would be a real scary experience and it turned out to be a fairly ordinary collection that, in my opinion, did not use the theme to its fullest advantage.<br />There are twenty eight stories in all, too many to list individually, but of notable mention are Chet Williamson's \\"Scalps\\", Charles Grant's \\"In The Still Small Hours\\", Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's \\"Echoes\\", Les Daniel's \\"The Man In The Mirror, Nancy Holder's \\"Tire Fire\\", and Stephen M. Rainey's \\"Piranha\\".<br />If you are really into the Horror Writer's of America collections, then grab this one if you can find it.  Otherwise, seek out a copy of HwofA \\"Freak Show\\" instead.  For a scarier air plane story, grab Richard Matheson's \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\".	2004-03-07
US	52859935	RICRWD4D7XEWR	0671431854	151270526	FEVRE DREAM	Books	5	30	37	N	N	Southern vampire tale richly backlit by the Steamer trade	Taking place in 1857, this story is about Abner Marsh, who is owner of the Fevre River Packet Company, and once held a profitable steamboat business upon the Mississippi River.  But one foul winter and a freezing river crippled his fleet and left him with nothing but his reputation as a formidable captain, and honest tradesman, and the ugliest man on the river.  He is down to one lowly boat that travels only on the Illinois, and that one fading fast, when he is approached by Joshua York, a pale, enigmatic businessman who makes an offer of partnership with Abner.<br />York makes an offer far above what the Fevre River Packet Company is worth, but tells Abner that it is because of his desire to own and operate a real steamboat, and be captain though Abner would run the daily functions and pilot the boat.  With Abner's experience and York's money, they come to an agreement to build the finest steamboat on the Mississippi, The Fevre Dream.  Crewed with the best, she sets out from New Albany towards New Orleans, stopping first in St. Louis.  Abner had not batted much of an eyelash when York first mentioned that he and his \\"guests\\" would be traveling up and down the river with him, his lust for owning a large, luxurious steamer that could beat The Eclipse's speed driving away the warning from York that he could be a bit...peculiar.<br />For York is a vampire, and is on a quest of his own.  He has developed a drink that staves off the Vampire's hunger for flesh, and has a dream of turning his people away from the killing of humans.  But working against him is Damon Julian, and his pack of hungry followers, who believe that the old ways are the good ways.  Also with Julian is Sour Billy Tipton, their human servant who assists them in acquiring what they need and protecting them.<br />Little by little, things begin to unravel, and by the time Julian and Sour Billy join up with Joshua York on The Fevre Dream, Abner has come to realize his dream of running the biggest and fastest steamer on the Mississippi was nothing more than a dream, and that his desires had blinded him to the reality of York's mission.<br />This is a unique vampire story, appropriate for both vampire purists and vampire modernists; actually staging a battle between the two factions.  Should vampires want to mingle amongst the human population, or should they retain their status as feeders and monsters?  By taking this approach and placing it in the 1850's South amid the lively steamboat trade up and down the Mississippi River, Martin has created a creepy and exceptional tale of languid horror in a lush backdrop.  This is a not to be missed novel whether you love vampire books or creepy southern tales.  Highly recommended.

US	52859935	R2HSBUZSNAZGGC	1892065932	183959492	Recycled	Books	3	8	9	N	Y	The kitschy formula fails in this sequel	With Selena Rosen's first book in this series, Queen of Denial, she brought out a fresh and yet trashy new heroine named Drewcila Qwah, a salvager who turns out to be the Queen of Barious with part of her brain removed.  While Queen of Denial was an adventurous romp under the tactless and crude guidance of the best garbage scow pilot in the galaxy, the formula fails with Qwah being bound to one planet.<br />Drew's stock in Qwah-Co is plummeting, so she heads pell-mell off for her home planet of Barious to stop her husband-in-name-only from starting a war with the Lockhedes, the people that the Barions share their planet with.  Zarco, Drew's husband, is determined to control her this time at any cost, and thwart her efforts to obtain peace between the people of Barious through a trade agreement.  Zarco is tired of being a figurehead, and re-establishes the nobles to positions of authority within the castle and starts a war.  He imprisons Drew, and its up to her friends Arcadia and Dylan to try and rescue her.  In the meantime, Van Gar, her furry sometime-mate has run off to join a religious cult of his fellow Chitzsky people only to find out he has been duped.  He must get the ship back from Pard-Jar, the cult leader, and return to Drew where he knows he belongs.<br />Drew and Zarco butt heads as we know they will, and it is a battle of the wills between taking the country to war or leading it into peace.<br />I'm not exactly sure where the formula failed; there is a plot of sorts and the saucy dialogue, but what worked in space travel becomes tedious in this second effort.  I loved Drew in the first book, but in this sequel she becomes rather...tedious; perhaps a little too forced.  Even on the cover art she looks less mischievous and more skanky, rather a \\"rode hard and put out wet\\" countenance that reflects what happened to her in this book.  The story went from Kitschy to Klutzy; and while the prose was jumpy in QofD (as I mentioned in my review of it) the prose in Recycled is stuttering and erratic.  Pieces of the plot vital to the story are tossed around like...well...garbage, added in at the last minute in an effort to explain something already occurring out of context.<br />While I still liked Drew's story, I found this sequel to be more of a chore to plow through than a delight like the first book.  My recommendation?  Read Queen of Denial, and if you are really enchanted then give Recycled a try.  If not, don't bother with this one, but don't ever give up on Selina Rosen as an author!  She is fresh and interesting and envigorating and unique, and a delight to sit back with and read her work.

Very well fleshed out characters and descriptive prose paint out the creepiness of tale in vivid color, taking place in the boondocks of Maryland along Highway 154, a little place called Tylersville.<br />With a brief prologue from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 1978, we are quickly moved ahead seven years into the life of Kurt Morris, a small town cop who rents a room from his Uncle Roy and is basically content with his life.<br />Lee wastes no time acquainting us his characters, exposing them completely right off the bat, forcing your acquaintance with then and making them familar to you whether you like them or not.<br />Lenny Stokes is the local yokel do-nothing scumbag who marries the innocent good-girl Vicky, a waitress at the local topless bar called The Anvil.  Police Chief Bard is posed immediately as a fat, boorish cop who is barely competent, Kurt's co-workers Mark Higgins and Doug Swaggert are competent in their own rights and fully characterized right away; with Higgins as the happy-go-lucky guy and Swaggert as the guy who takes no crap and has been in trouble for his attitude.  Kurt's long time friend Glen Rodz is a strange if amiable guy who works night shift as a guard on Dr. Williard's estate named Belleau Wood.  Vicky Stokes is a mildly vapid but sweet girl who married wrong and seems determined to live with a husband that beats her and cheats on her.  Joanne Sulley is The Anvil's prize dancer, and openly having an affair with Lenny Stokes. Melissa is Kurt's twelve year old neice, who is an obnoxious tease, but never seems to really develope as much as the rest of the characters.  Another character called Sanders will show up later in the storyline...but I won't ruin that for you.<br />Things in Tylersville are as predictable as the rain, until the town's drunk Cody Drucker dies and is buried, only to have his coffin dug up just days later.  Baffling enough in and of itself in this quiet town, Kurt barely has time to wonder about Drucker's missing body when a young girl turns up missing also.  Things start looking their worst when one of Kurt's co-workers goes missing also, but he little does he realize this is just the beginning.<br />Very strange and unexplainable things are happening in Tylersville, and they all seem connected to Belleau Wood; and the strange, enigmatic Dr. Charles Willard and his beautiful young wife Nancy.  Bit by bit Kurt tries to peel away the layers of mystery and the unknown horror that seems to be settling over his town, while Glen seems to become more and more vague, Vicky more and more harassed, and Chief Bard is forced to suspend him from the force.<br />As the title suggests, there are Ghouls out there, but what are they, and where are they, and who is behind their arrival in Tylersville?  A decently thick 444 page novel, I nonetheless tore through this in less than a day.  It is a plainly written, extremely fast paced journey into horror and mystery and suspense that you should not deprive yourself of.  Though Lee's work has definitely developed over the years, this earlier work has less gore and more \\"feeling\\" to it, but there is still enough blood to make it a tasty addition to your library.

US	52859935	R23XYXTGIT1WMX	1892389347	856384491	White and Other Tales of Ruin	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Into the light of the creeping darkness I slide......	If you love spellbound, creepy tales of unbound terror and dread that comes from the soul, do not miss Lebbon's collection put together here in \\"White & Other Tales of Ruin.\\"  This is the first book of Lebbon I have read, and believe me I am running to the bookshelves for more.<br /><br />His monsters are typically unseen but felt deep within your senses, rousing your inner level of safety to an alarming state of anxiety and trepidation.  The prose is poetic in its telling of what the protagonists feel and taste and smell and see, the dialogue flowing and smooth, and the terror huge and real.<br /><br />With a wonderful introduction by author Jack Ketchum, he mentions that Lebbon's stories have \\"teeth\\", and indeed they do; trust me, you will feel the bite.  Also notable to me was the use of Caniglia's \\"On The Edge Of Paradise\\" artwork used for the jacket cover, and preceding each story is another horrendously beautiful sketch of Caniglia, whom I think is one of the most talented modern day artists.<br />There are six tales here in this collection, and I will give a brief summary of each.<br />White - Some people called it \\"The Doom\\", others called it \\"The Ruin\\", but either way it spelled a change in the world as we know it.  Seven people find themselves trapped in a large manor house, each having initially gone there to get away from the haunts of their past.  When the snow came, it didn't stop, and now everything is completely frozen, as the snow piles up higher and higher.  There is no working transportation to take them back to the town 10 miles away, so they wait for the snow to stop.<br />Tension grows as one by one, each admit to having seen something in the snow; a deer perhaps, or a seagull or a cat, flitting just outside their peripheral vision.  The only thing they know for sure, is that it's white.  The story begins with the first death, and will lead us through to the conclusion, with the things that dart and flutter just outside our vision.<br />From Bad Flesh - One of my favorites.  After The Ruin, diseases of different sorts are spread throughout the world, with names like Numb-Skull, TGD, and QS.  Our protagonist Gabe has what is just referred to as The Sickness, and his friend Della tells him of a man named String who lives on the island of Malakki near Greece who could possibly have a cure for his deadly illness.  So Gabe travels to Malakki, where the dead are piled up in the harbor like cordwood and the Lordships still do their fly-by's.  Here he meets Jade, a beautiful woman, who saves him from an insane crowd and promises to take him to String.<br />Their journey up into the mountains is hellish and gripping in its intensity, revealing horrors to Gabe that he had not thought humans capable of.  They reach the little village where String lives, surrounded by a glass moat, and Gabe and Jade are welcomed into the village.  Who is String, and where does he come from?  What is the secret to his cure?  How does he have this power?  Will Gabe receive the cure?  Lebbon will suck you into this tale and not leave you disappointed in the end.<br />Hell - Not necessarily my favorite, but I think only because I was spoiled by Edward Lee's vision of hell in his book City Infernal.  Lebbon's vision of hell is just as disturbing though, as voyeurs take a tram journey through hell, watching the horrors through the shaded windows while strapped into their comfortable seats; all to prove that \\"things could be worse in their own life\\".<br />After Nolan's wife dies, his daughter Laura suddenly goes missing; and imagining her under the sway of some religious cult, Nolan takes the tram into hell to search for her.  When he sees her actually inside hell, strung up upon a barbed wire fence, he fights the demons who control the tram with the help of Chele, a woman who lost her son, and manages to escape the tram and enter hell itself.  Together they save Laura from the fence, but now they are stuck in hell, and don't know the way out.<br />The First Law - Incredibly creepy story of five survivors adrift in a lifeboat after their ship is torpedoed during the war.  Their lifeboat has been aimlessly drifting for five days, and the five men are sunburned and dehydrated when the oceans currents pull them straight to a strange island.

I can already feel the cheese crawling off the movie version with barely restrained anticipation.<br />As typical with Lees more masterful pieces, this is a disgustingly gruesome, gross, violent, barf-inducing tale that the squeamish must stay away from at all costs.  Only those with strong stomachs and iron wills should pick up this tasty morsel.<br />The Bigheads grandpappy dies, and so Bighead heads out from the lower woods to find The World Outside, what his grandpappy always talked of.  He is called the bighead because of his hydrocephaly: a head shaped like a watermelon, one eye the size of a grapefruit and the other the size of a tennis ball, an awl shaped mouth filled with jagged sharp teeth, and a low intellect that understands nothing but eating and mating, neither of which Bighead does daintily.<br />With Bighead headed towards The World Outside, Charity Wells was heading back towards the town she was born in, a tiny place called Luntville nestled in the Appalachian mountains, heading home to be back with her dear Aunt Annie.  Advertising for a ride share, she makes the journey with Jerrica Perry, a journalist assigned to write a four piece in depth article about the Appalachians.  Charity and Jerrica both have problems, of an exact opposite nature.  While Charity cannot seem to ever reach a second date with a boy, Jerrica is a sex addict who cannot stay with only one man, and who is never satisfied.<br />The two girls stay at Aunt Annies boarding house, Jerrica starting on her article and Charity catching up on old times with Aunt Annie.<br />Also staying at Aunt Annies is Tom Alexander, an out of the ordinary Catholic Priest who has been sent by the Richmond Diocesan Pastoral Center to re-open the Wroxeter Abby.  Once a hospice for terminally ill priests, the church had decided to reopen it as a rehab center for the priests who were accused of alcoholism, gambling addictions, and pedophilia.  Tom is out of the ordinary because he does not follow the typical beaten path that one would expect of a priest; he smokes and drinks and cusses.  Once a Army Ranger, a killer and rapist in the name of war, he swore off all his previous evils and became a priest.  Tom is also a psychologist, which makes him the perfect choice for the task of establishing the rehab center.  It also gets him and his embarrassing behavior out of the limelight of the church.<br />Add in a couple of absolutely pustulant local boys named Dicky Caudill and Tritt Balls Conner, who run moonshine over the state line and terrorize anyone who crosses their paths.  Literally terrorize them; rape and murder are as common to Tritt as breathing.  There are no holes barred with their depravity and viciousness.<br />Take two pretty girls with problems, a renegade priest, two local human monsters, an odd Aunt with a past, a weird little cemetery, a haunted abbey, a bizarre lake, and an inhuman monster trekking cross country towards Luntville, stir them up all together and you have Lees The Bighead.  Add rape, murder, vomit, poop, disfigurement, dismemberment, cocaine addiction, sexx addiction, dirty little secrets, and a handyman named Goop Gooder, and you have an un-put-downable, gruesome read that will leave you both satisfied and disgusted.  Despite how abhorrant the content is, Bighead is very well written and the storyline flows like a smooth river of blood, and there is some interesting artwork preceding each chapter by Erik Wilson.

Beautys life starts out wonderful enough, daughter of a well-to-do merchant and ship-owner, living in luxury with him and her two sisters, Hope and Grace.  When her fathers entire fleet is lost, he makes plans to settle his debts and retire to the country with what little remained to him.  Grace had lost her love Robbie on one of the ships, and Hopes secret love Gervain, who was nothing more than an ironworker in Fathers shipyard, steps forward to tell of a place to be had for little money in his hometown of Blue Hill.<br />He offers to travel with them back to his hometown and set up a blacksmiths shop with Father, and they all agree to do this.  Blue Hill is a far cry from the city from where the girls came, and they struggle to fall into a routine of work that they are unaccustomed to.  Beauty was the youngest, but also the strongest, and she was the one who took on the rougher, outdoor chores, leaving her sisters to care for the household.  Life continues, Hope marries Gervain, who superstitiously warns everyone to never venture into the woods behind their cabin at any time.<br />Comes the day Father gets word of one of his ships coming in, returns to the city, and on his way back, of course, gets lost in the woods where he runs into the estates of the Beast.  The fairytale bargain is struck, and Beauty agrees to take her fathers place at the Beasts grand palace to keep him company.<br />McKinley tells a beautiful, fully fleshed out story here, far more than the fairy tale with loveable characters, believable events, comedy and tragedy and love.  If you need a break from life for awhile, pick up Beauty and give it a whirl.  Enjoy!	2004-02-14

Callahan's Place is a mysterious little bar in the wilds of Suffolk County, owned and operated by a large, red headed, pudding faced Irishman named Mike Callahan.  Callahan's place is where people from all over time and space and earth gather just to be together and to expel the demons that haunt them.  Most notable for every drink in the place costing 50 cents, you put a dollar bill on the bar, drink your drink, and either gather your 50 cents in change or choose to make a toast and smash your glass in the large fireplace that Callahan sweeps out daily.  Most choose to smash their glass.<br />There is a mystery to Callahan's, it is a place that has some mystical power to heal the wounds of the soul, a power that seems to be solely comprised of camaraderie and friendship.<br />In Callahan's every Monday is the Fireside Fill-More Sing-a-Long, every Tuesday is Punday, every Wednesday is Tall Tales Night, and everyday is a celebration of life.<br />This frivolous and bawdy tale is told by one Jake Stonebender, a man who lost his wife and daughter in an automobile accident and came to Callahan's to find healing.  He introduces us to Mike Callahan himself, plus Old Doc Webster, a large, red faced doctor who is always present; Fast Eddie Costigan, the piano player; Mickey Finn, the alien sent to destroy the world who winds out a regular at Callahan's; young Tommy Janssen who kicks his herion habit to join the happy ranks at the bar; Rachael, whose extended mortality only makes her more aware of death; and many others.<br />Along the way we hear fantastical stories by young Jim McDonald about his telepathic brother Paul, the Meddler who tells a tale of time travel to save a beautiful singer, Tony Telasco who refused to kill anyone in `Nam and went from booze to smack to mediation to Callahan's, Fogerty and his telekinetic powers during the Third Annual Darts Championship of the Universe, and even Broodseven-Sub-Two Raksha, who spins a tale of incubating the earth for his people in order to harvest it.<br />Callahan's Crosstime Saloon is only 205 pages, and while I enjoyed the bawdy humor and basic plot of the story, I did find it to be just a little dry in the telling.  But, since this is the first in Spider Robinson's series, I am looking forward to reading more sequels, and hoping that he falls into a more liquid and flowing niche with this fun tale.

And boy, am I glad he writes!  If you are queasy of stomach or easily grossed out, skip this one.  But if would like a little bit of senseless gruesomeness and a surprisingly well written early work of Lee, pick this one up.  If you can find a copy.<br />OPAS has two stories inside, both are treats.  In his forward, Lee warns you that this is a foul book, but if you like it messy I urge you to enjoy this anyway.  The first story, &quot;That's Some Pig&quot;, is a sickening, squishy tale of familial torture, evisceration, stuffed animals, a busy spider, lime Jello, and missing Mommy.  Yuck!  Written by David Wilson and Brett Savory.<br />The second story, &quot;Charlie's Web&quot;, written by Edward Lee and John Pelan, is about a self employed plumber who is transformed into a pig while out on a remote job.  He meets a fellow victim trapped inside a spider, and they get together to plot again the witch who transformed them.<br />Bestiality, sorcery, and learning to deal with a new body are the repugnant topics for this little taste of hell.  Yuck!<br />Putrid, vile, disgusting entertainment for those with iron stomachs and a penchant for all things foul.  Enjoy...if you dare.	2004-02-02
US	52859935	R210FWSIRQYDW6	006205161X	39806637	Beauty Queen	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	A 90's version of Go Ask Alice that is not just for teens	Written as a young girl's diary, the book immediately immerses you as Samantha's best friend, the one she will tell everything to.  I found myself liking Sam right away, I imaged her as having an innocence, or gullibility to her that was sweet but not annoying; and right away we see that her feelings run deep beneath the surface of her pretty face.<br />Sam starts her diary immediately following her break up with her boyfriend, who she cared deeply for and who abruptly informed her that he was seeing a woman 15 years his senior.  He broke her heart, and so at her psychiatrist's suggestion, she begins to write down her feelings for us.  In light of being her only confidant, right away we discover that her mother is a well-off alcoholic, a former model falling into her decline, with a handsome boyfriend who would like nothing more than to get to know Sam a little better while her mother is passed out.  Right away we glimpse Kevin Reed's intentions as Sam returns home to find him in her bedroom watching porn flicks and asking her to join him.<br />Sam knows she needs a change in her life, but her low self esteem tells her she is not smart enough for college, that no one could possibly love her, and that she will never be able to even take acting classes to become the actress she dreams of being.  She and her best friend Nicole do find a nice place and move in, taking Sam's diabetic cat with her.  Then Sam decides to take a job in a topless club, leaving behind her low paying fast food job.  She is very nervous at first, and a fellow dancer turns her onto the \\"relaxing\\" effects of heroin, telling her that her modesty and uneasiness will dissolve, making the job more tolerable.  Which it does.<br />And so begins Sam's decline.  Still heart-broken over her ex-boyfriend, she meets a man named Angelo who has ties to the mafia but treats her with respect and affection.  She also meets Blaine, a handsome and reckless cop who frequents the strip club.  I found these two relationships of particular interest in reading Ms. Glovach's story, because Sam is at heart an innocent girl, she readily trusts the cop and not the mafia thug; and the good/bad roles here are reversed, only magnifying Sam's naivet&eacute; when judging character.  Her desire to be loved is heart wrenching, and manifests in all the love that she pours out to others who become close to her.  In the case of her ailing cat, the love is justified.  But in the case of Blaine, this love is used against her in a thoughtless and heartless manner by a man who is seeking only his own gratification for his own sick uses.<br />Finding a release from her pain, boredom, dejection, and feelings of inadequacy with the heroin, her usage increases at an alarming rate while we listen in helpless silence to her denial of addiction.  Eventually, she is unable to even finish a diary entry without shooting up, and yet still she offhandedly dismisses her habit as recreation rather than real addiction.<br />This sad tale of a beautiful girl becomes all the more depressing when you realize that it has truly poured from the heart of Anygirl in Anywhere.  Our daughters, our sisters, our nieces, our friends; they all manifest feelings of inadequacy somewhere in their life, and this story could be theirs.  On a quick note, the author, Linda Glovach, tells of purchasing and using heroin in order to \\"get the feel of the book\\", and found herself addicted and almost dead in a hospital.  Her amazingly articulate vocalization of her experience should be noted.  Of her own experience with heroin addiction, she said, \\"In truth, you make a deal with the Devil. He takes away your pain, but he owns you. You live for the next fix.\\"<br />Poetic and real.  Don't be fooled into believing that this is a book only for teens, do yourself a favor, especially if you have a daughter, and pick this up.  It's a quick, poignant, unforgettable read.

While her writing is tough and no-nonsense, Kathleen is a scarred and insecure soul, fixed into a daily ritual that both calms and annoys her.  Until the day she opens her mail and finds a grisly morsel within, along with a fan letter asking her \\"Would you like to write my story?\\"<br />Kathleen goes to the police with the ghastly evidence and macabre letter, and her case is assigned to Lt. Jeffrey Spence, a man hardened and insensate from his own inability to love not only those who have cared for him, but also himself.  In his questioning of Kathleen, he is predatory and ruthless, peeling away all of her layers of privacy and exposing her painful past while attacking her fragile sense of self-worth.  He uncovers the scars left on her psyche from years of sexual abuse from her own uncle, loosening her tenuous hold on her own lucidity.<br />Though Kathleen is a virtual well of emotions, and Spence a virtual void; veritably opposite poles of empty souls, I found myself liking each character immediately, so well fleshed out were they at the very beginning of this story.  After tossing empty threats at each other during her interview, Spence gives Kathleen a dire warning to notify him immediately if she receives any more mail, either letters or body parts, from her newest fan.<br />When Kathleen appears for a speaking engagement, she meets a poet named Maxwell Platt, who was the speaker before her.  Her mind is in a whirl after another confrontation with Spence, and they go out for drinks where she proceeds to get drunk.  Finding herself at Platt's apartment, she decides to up the level of intimacy with him and sleeps with him.<br />Platt came across as a man who was overly mellow and a mild push-over; a man too placid to be of interest under normal circumstances.  But with Lee & Steffen's amazing ability to flesh out the characters in this book, I actually found myself caring deeply for a person who in real life I would normally overlook.  His easy going manner against Kathleen's often harsh behavior, his acceptance of her nervous and tactless mannerisms, only made him a more likeable character rather than sinking him into the role of pansy.  Lee & Steffen managed to make this character strong in his gentleness.<br />Our killer, meanwhile, is very busy.  She has more letters to write to Kathleen, and needs the subjects in which to tell her tales.  She finds her victims by cruising the bars, and picking up the most hateful men you can imagine.  I'm not talking bad looking or anything like that, I am talking about men who are truly hateful human beings.  The authors delve into these personalities also, despicable men with callous and brutal thoughts that under normal circumstances you would love to see tortured.  It is almost unimaginable that you will find yourself feeling sorry for these pathetic excuses for men; but trust me, you will.<br />So brutal is our psychopath, so thorough and devoid of empathy as she literally tears the men apart, making sure that they remain conscious as long as possible in order that they feel the punishment she metes out to them, you will actually pity the monsters being tortured.  Of course, there is also a great deal of empathy for our lovely psychopath herself as she unwinds her story in the letters to Kathleen Shade; commentaries on the most brutal, horrific sexual and physical abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of both strangers and her own parents.<br />Life is a snake pit, especially when you can find yourself feeling compassion towards the sickest ofthe human collective.  Pay particular attention to the psychopath's letter to Kathleen entitled \\"Manburger\\", where one of the most vile of men meets an extensively gruesome ending at under the tender administrations of an authentic, veritable psychopath.<br />This book has many fine points to it, amongst which is the ability to immediately identify with and like the characters despite their obvious behavior flaws; not to mention the blood and the guts and the mindless torture.  And don't be afraid if you find a tender spot in your own heart for the blooming relationship between Kathleen and Platt, as I did.  I found it to be a warm and human thread in an otherwise brutal story.<br />Do not miss out on this book!  I cannot stress that enough.  Lee and Steffen have truly created a monster of unfathomable proportions here, and I guarantee that your own twisted need to read the bloodiest of scenes will be utterly satisfied here; finger lickin good even. If you are not an aficionado of horror and grotesqueries, don't pick it up or you will find yourself barfing out your lunch.<br />Enjoy!of the human collective.

I soon found myself unable to put it down, being immediately absorbed into the young protagonist's life.<br />At first, I thought this book would not be my cup of tea, so to speak.  Boy, was I wrong!<br />We start with an introduction into the life of a nineteen year old young man, struggling with his thoughts of the future, his parents, girls, his lot in life, and how he is going to fit into his own life.  His father's thoughts seem to dominate his musings, and he struggles with himself in the dawning realization that his father just may be right.<br />He has no direction, and questions his own actions and morality in the light of the path his friends have followed.  Then something truly amazing happens to him, something so surreal and fantastic that he finds himself both frightened and awed by it.<br />Introduced now is Theodore, a strange little man who leads our protagonist on an amazing journey.  Theodore tries to show the youth a new and different perspective of life, and in the process the youth finds a fresh attitude towards both himself, and his parents, and the life he once led.<br />In the midst of all the bizarre and odd things happening to him, and Theodore's eccentric tirades that perplexingly match his father's opinions, the youth discovers that sometimes where you are at in life, both in the physical and metaphysical realms, can be the most pleasing moment in time even if you cannot see it then.<br />This is an amazingly well written book by a first time author, and whether you agree with the political aspects that arise in the storyline or not, you will not walk away untouched by the changes in the youth's life, nor the changes in his physical and mental worlds.  You find yourself asking....what if it were me?<br />Pick this one up, it's a short, fast read that I found highly intriguing and pleasurable.  Enjoy!	2004-01-26

Some people want all the money in the world, and some people want to rule the world.  But Farrington wants to challenge God.<br />If there was ever a book written that will make you throw up your dinner, this is the one.  A mere 116 pages will leave your psyche scathed and bleeding, and your mouth wide open in a silent scream of repulsion.  With that in mind, take this journey as I did.<br />Westmore and Bryant, photographer and reporter respectively, get the big assignment of interviewing the mega rich Farrington; a man who has never truly been photographed before and whose ultra rich lifestyle is a complete mystery.  They have an unlikely friendship, with Bryant seeming to have all his ducks in a row, and Westmore being a bit of a loser and a big time drinker.<br />It doesn't take long for them to discover that things are very, very wrong at the Farrington mansion, and that they are a &quot;paid in full&quot; part of his diabolical plan to record for properity his sick and twisted challenge to God.<br />Now, realize that a Teratologist does not study terrain or geology as some might think; Teratology is the study of study of malformations or serious deviations from the normal type in organisms.  In other words; Freaks, the grossly disfigured, the grotesque and warped forgotten aberrations of the human world.<br />Farrington is a collecter of these damaged and oppressed oddities and deviants, stealing them away from the institutions that both care for them and abuse them.  His intentions are no nobler than those who abused these horribly deformed creatures though, it is these souls that he intends to call God with.<br />Manufacturing a new drug that will make viagra look like a sugar pill, he uses these tortured subjects along with kidnapped religious leaders to test his new drug, while in the process attempting to thwart and anger God so much that He will show his face.<br />When you take Edward Lee and add in James White, you are indeed asking for the most gruesome of monsters, the most horrid of atrocities, and can rest assured that they will be told in the most drippingly explicit detail imaginable.  If you are faint of heart, easily repulsed, have a weak gag reflex, or are quick to disgorge the contents of your stomach from precise and specific descriptions of simply terrifyingly gross material, put this book down and back slowly away from it.<br />But if you occasionally enjoy a warped romp through a sickening, twisted, evilly painted environment of insane grossness; this is your kind of roller coaster.

If you are looking for nose-in-the-air literature, you are looking in the wrong place with Queen of Denial.<br />However, if you want a lightening fast read that will leave you chuckling, kick back and enjoy.<br />Drewcila Qwah is the best salvager in the galaxy.  She loves beer, smoking, rousting about with her first mate Van Gar (a large fur covered alien) in the spaceport bars, and causes a disturbance wherever she goes.<br />Surprisingly, her garbage scow is hired to transport King Zarco back to his homeworld, and she is made an offer she can't refuse.<br />But during her mission, she finds out that Zarco has been searching for his missing queen Taralin, and that she's the one he's looking for.  She has no memory of her abduction or anything prior to it, for her captures removed part of her brain.  Still, she decides to go ahead with Zarco and see what she can get from this planet.  After all, she's their Queen.<br />In an uproarously funny adventure, Drew and Van Gar wind out turning Barion upside down while trying to fix their post war problems, all while someone keeps making attempts on Drew's life.<br />This book is nothing more than a simplistic romp from one planet to another, more of a character story with a sci-fi background.  There is hardly any prose at all, which causes the book to be a bit jumpy, but the dialogue is smart and sassy and filled with laughs and clever banter.<br />If I were ever to take a space adventure, I would want Drew as my pilot.  So put away your snobbish discretion and settle down into the wacky capers of the irascible Queen of Garbage.  Enjoy!	2004-01-14

In this collection of 13 chilling stories by Scott Nicholson, you will not be disappointed if you have an appreciation of that tingly odd shiver that teases your spinal cord from time to time.  In summary, here are the stories.<br />Haunted - One of my favorites, a story of who's-haunting-who?<br />The Vampire Shortstop - Probably my least favorite.  I'm not a fan of humanized vampires or sports either.  A young vampire boy just wants to play baseball.<br />Skin - Another favorite.  Do donors haunt their parts?<br />Dead Air - Great story of a disc jockey's telephone relationship with a serial killer.<br />In The Heart Of November - A haunting relationship between two friends that crosses the border of the living.<br />The Three Dollar Corpse - A tale of prisoner's who sell the right to take corpses out from their camps in order to buy goods, and a revelation of who watches them.<br />Thirst - What, or Who, are the elements anyway?<br />Do You Know Me Yet? - The madness of a writer, and a bit of a dig at S. King.<br />Homecoming - Another of my favorites.  A down to earth man is visited by the corpse of his son.<br />Kill Your Darlings - Not one of my favorites, another surrealistic writer's fantasy of his pages coming to life.<br />Metabolism - Not one of my favorites, a walk through insanity with a frail woman.<br />The Boy Who Saw Fire - Another story of what, or who, are the elements?  Similar to Thirst.<br />Constitution - Another favorite.  Loves crosses all boundaries, even death.<br />Afterwards - I listed this like it was a story, but it is not.  It is Mr. Nicholson's tales of each of the 13 stories here, how he thought them up and where they were first published.  Since I enjoyed his musings on his selection of tales, I included it as a story worth reading.<br />All in all, a fine collection of dreamy tales that are short and easily read, a worthwhile addition to your collection.

I'm not sorry.  This is a well written book that details the life of someone who is not only submersed in poverty, but does not have the personal drive to do anything about it.<br />A realistic glimpse into the lives of those we see out there everyday, but thankfully don't have to live ourselves.<br />Our protagonist is an intelligent man, but has no desire to do anything with his life.  He works as an usher at a third rate local theater, and is content with meager wages and life in the slow lane.  He has a girlfriend and a place to stay and a job, and that seems to be enough.  Until he meets a co-worker at the theater, and decides that he should have an affair with her.  She, unfortunately, does not reciprocate his feelings, but leads him on anyway.<br />When his girlfriend finds out, she kicks him out of their apartment, forcing him to go and stay with an old friend of his.  I found his friend to be one of the more interesting characters in the book, until......you should read it for yourself.<br />Things go from bad to worse, with our narrator winding up working in a gay porno theater and pretending to be gay to keep the job, getting involved in some shady business, getting badly beaten up not once but a few times.<br />He looses his place to stay, looses his new job, looses his friends, looses, well....everything.  Rather a \\"rags to rags\\" story, with a surprise ending that brings him closer to the one person he hates above everyone else, and back into a lifestyle of mediocre contentment.<br />This was an entertaining and enlightening read, well written, and taking us into paths we are curious about but just prefer not to tread in ourselves.  Good book.  Enjoy!	2003-12-31

Need a break from all that serious reading you've been doing?  Ever wonder how those bad guys you read about and see on TV get to be so very bad?  Here's your answer.<br />How to be a Villain is a wonderful, tongue-in-cheek, humorous look at the steps one must take to become evil.<br />It starts out with the concepts and benefits of being evil, complete with a quick quiz to discover if you truly are evil.  You will choose a name, a motive, and a signature laugh to start you on your way; freeing yourself up to focus on just what kind of evil villain you would excel at.  The choices are many, and often times combinable.<br />Once your career path is planned out, you will need an evil master plan, and in order to carry this out effectively you will need to study up on the forces of good, and how they often present themselves.<br />Now we're cooking.  Find yourself an evil home by studying the broad selection available in these pages, give yourself an outfit and an evil makeover that suits you from the possibilities Mr. Zawacki has lined up, and you are on your way to fulfilling all the evil desires that have been festering inside you for so long; he has even included an easy-to-follow work sheet to speed you along your way.<br />This was a fun, fanciful read; a nice break from real life.  The layout is similar to other &quot;how to&quot; books, one of the things that makes it fun; but the illustrations could have (and should have) been better.  But the writing is fun and frisky, with a tongue-in-cheek humor that will leave you laughing.<br />I'll include an example of choosing an evil home.  The choices are underground lair, hollowed out volcano, medieval castle, hell, corporate tower, airship, haunted woods, abandoned church, dungeon, and more.  In considering Hell for an evil home, Mr. Zawacki writes:<br />&quot;Hell has long been the favored choice for supernatural creatures and sorcerous evil-doers and should serve nicely as your new home.  You will be pleased to find numerous amenities, including demons available to assist you with your evil deeds and countless souls to torment and devour should the days get dull.  The Gates of Hell are an excellent defense against angelic attack, and sporting opportunities on the River Styx are within walking distance.  The key drawback of Hell is the flesh-scorching climate, although it has the virtue of keeping property values extremely affordable.<br />This is the kind of humor that fills this book from front to back, and is a light hearted romp through the dilemmas of choosing to be evil and going forward with your evil plans.

This is a continuing story, and I very much recommend that you start with the first book, Stardoc, and read the sequels in order:  Stardoc, Beyond Vallarean, Endurance, then Shockball.  If you haven't, the rest of this review will contain spoilers for the first three.<br />Again, I was a bit disappointed with Shockball, but only because the first two books were so very good.  Shockball continues the adventures of Cherijo Grey Veil Torin, a genetically engineered human who is being pursued by her creator/father throughout the galaxy.  After escaping the Hsktskt in Endurance, Cherijo finds herself surrendering to her father in order to keep the peace once again, but this time her husband Duncan is with her.  After enduring many brutal hours of testing, she is miraculously rescued by an odd little man who takes her though miles of underground tunnels to his tribe that lives beneath the ground in caverns.<br />Cherijo discovers she is not so much rescued as she is kidnapped by these strange people, half Indian and half alien.<br />Again, I found this book to be a step down from the first two in the series, there are not many aliens, as Cherijo spends most of her time underground with the half breeds; and not much titillating space travel either.<br />Dhreen re-enters her life, finding her in the tunnels and once again helping her out, though this time she trusts him much less.  She also discovers that experiments A through I were not destroyed as Joseph Grey Veil had told her, and also discovers that the reason Joe has pursued her so heavily throughout the galaxy is that he intended her to be his mate all along.<br />Cherijo patches up patients, stops another outbreak, and develops her relationship with her husband Duncan who is forced to participate in the Shockball contests and discovers he actually enjoys the physical competition.  But the story seemed almost blas&eacute;, missing the mystery of the aliens and the excitement Cherijo stretching her capabilities to the fullest.<br />I have really enjoyed this series, but I am left hoping that the fifth book brings back the old Cherijo and the old mystery and excitement that made this such a special and unique reading journey.hing her capabilities to the fullest.<br />I have really enjoyed this series, but I am left hoping that the fifth book brings back the old Cherijo and the old mystery and excitement that made this such a special and unique reading journey.	2003-12-09

He has a good job, a beautiful but self-centered fianc&eacute; named Jessica, and a comfortable future awaiting him.<br />Until he finds a young girl practically unconscious on the sidewalk as he Jessica are walking towards a pivotal dinner meeting for her career.  The girl is hurt and bleeding, and without knowing why Richard helps her, making Jessica angry enough to break off their engagement.<br />The girl's name is Door, and after sending Richard off an a very odd errand into what Richard would discover was London Below, he returns with the Marquis de Carabas who has agreed to help Door.  There are also two very odd and dangerous gentlemen looking for Door, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, who appear at Richard's apartment in their search for the girl.<br />But Richard wasn't aware that once he ventured into London Below, he would become faded in London Above, not quite invisible but pretty much ceasing to exist.  Richard must return to London Below and find Door again, in order to try and get his life back in London Above.<br />Not so much a different world, or even truly below the London he is used to, but more of a parallel reality, London Below is a strange, wondrous, and dangerous place.  Neil Gaiman has brought to life a fantastic world that is definitely worth your time to explore along with Richard and Door.<br />Door wishes to find her family's killers, Richard wants to go back to London Above, and Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are closing in on both of them, hired assassins with an unclear mission and mysterious employer.<br />The story moves with a rapid pace through peril after peril through bizarre markets and deadly bridges and odd links between London Above and London Below, a very interesting and compelling read with a highly fueled imaginative setting and fully fleshed out characters.

Now we find Cherijo Grey Veil Torin taken captive by the Hsktskt's, on their way to a trade port that deals in selling slaves.  She is branded and made slave to OverMaster HalaVar, who is not a true Hsktskt but her own husband Duncan Reever.<br />Under his protection she is allowed to serve on the HskTskt ship as a medical doctor, and along the way discovers a strange disease among the league prisoners that kills without leaving behind any traces except a resemblance to spinal meningitis.<br />This series is best started at the first book, StarDoc, and followed through in its sequence.  The first two novels, StarDoc and Beyond Varallan are much better than Viehl's third effort here.  Although I still give it four stars for the quality of characterization and imagination in dreaming up new species, Viehl's plot in this sequel falls flat compared to the other two.<br />I became a little bored with the repetitive &quot;catch and release&quot; theme that seemed to dominate here:  she's working in medical, a bad guy takes her to solitary (or torture) Reever rescues her, she goes back to medical, a bad guy takes her to solitary (or torture), Reever rescues her, and so on and so on.<br /><br />This plotline cycled through itself way too many times in this follow-up in Cherijo's journeys, but I like the character so much I was willing to cycle with her.  I am now reading the fourth installment and have both confidence and hope that Viehl will not repeat the weak plot mistake she made in this book.<br />All in all, the series is an extremely imaginative and fun romp through space with odd aliens and medical disasters and action packed thrills, just consider this third in the series a break from the norm.

When I found that he was the editor of this collection of vampire tales, I had to buy it.<br />This is a collection of short stories from various authors, each one a separate tale unlike the Horror Writers of America collection called Freak Show, which was every author writing a chapter in one continuous tale.<br />The premise of these stories is what would happen when the vampires won.  In all reality, I didnt care much for most of these tales.  I am a vampire purist, and do not care for tales where *they* want to be like *us*.  This entire trend towards vampires walking in daylight and having emotions and being scientists and conducting experiments and flying helicopters and holding courtroom dramas is nothing more than the response of the masses to the erotic, appealing nature of the vampire.  To the purist, it would be just as silly to have Zombies suddenly stop craving fresh human flesh and to begin to hold decoupage classes.<br />The only times I can remember this working is in George R.R. Martins Fevre Dream and Whitley Stribers The Hunger.  In The Hunger, Miriam was never actually called a Vampire though, and in Fevre Dream the only Vampire that wanted to change was hunted by both humans and by his own species for his aberrations.  In all of these stories, the only one that was really gripping was The Miracle Mile.

This disturbing collections of short stories, musings, and seemingly random thoughts actually hovers somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but I give Mr. Gira the benefit of the doubt.  The purity of the ugliness written almost poetically on these pages becomes almost beautiful in its sick, twisted, dark, painful, pain-filled, drug-induced dislocation of mind and self.<br />In other words, Michael Gira is one sick little puppy.  There is harmony in his savage portrayals of empty submission to torture and honestly in his slipping away of self.  Brutal self loathing and a vicious need of self-punishment dominate these unpleasant tales and musings, with the sharpened sting of drug enhanced delusions of mind and body slipping away into nothingness.<br />Only from the mind of a tortured, clinically depressed soul could tales such as these sprout; ugly and black with poisonous fangs, sickly perverse and bitterly cruel.  This collection is not for the squeamish or light hearted, or even for those looking for the bloodbath type of horror musings; however it does contain more searching of the true illness of mind and body than the merely tediously disgusting works of Poppy Z. Brite or Cara Bruce.<br />Michael Gira was also the singer/songwriter for the band The Swans, a dark and moody goth/industrial type band from the 80s and has done a few Cds on his own.  This stories are as tortured and depressing as his music.<br />My major complaint was after reading about three quarters of the way through the stories, they kind of began to blend into each other.  Though the descriptions were almost poetic in their brutality, they became repetitive after awhile, different wordings of the same internal and external tortures. It was a little like having your depressed friend come over and stay a little too long, going on and on about how horrible their life is.  But all in all, if you want to read something even more disturbing and disjointed than Bret Easton Ellis American Psycho, pick this up.  Just don't read it at night, or when you are depressed.<br />Also, I apologize for my punctuation, but until Amazon fixes its glitch of transforming punctuation into question marks and onehalf symbols, I find myself refraining from using them.up.

First of all, you need to read StarDoc first in order to capture the mood and intent of this second novel in the series.<br />I will repeat that this is not great fiction, but one of the most pleasant fictional journeys I have made in awhile.  Mostly Sci-Fi, the StarDoc novels surprisingly cross genres in a pleasing way.  Space travel, fantastic aliens, medical thriller, murder mystery, romance, and comedy all come together in that rare way seldom achieved to bring us readers this un-mind-cluttering escape from our mundane everyday lives and suck us into the fantastic and unpredictable world of Dr. Cherijo Grey Veil.<br />Again, read StarDoc first, without it you will be lost.<br />After being rescued from her predicament on K2 by her adopted HouseClan, Cherijo travels with her HouseClan of Torin on their huge ship called The Sunlace.

US	52859935	R25I1XB7SSPPR1	0967363802	785881990	Viscera	Books	1	3	8	N	Y	Messy, boring, sophomoric attempt at shock falls short	Not entertaining at all, a collection of 25 of the worst (and fortunately very short) stories I have read.  I read many short story collections in the sci-fi/horror genre and this is indeed at the bottom of the pile.  There are not even inventive tales of necrophilia in this trashpile such as the editors review hints at; merely deviant tales of gay sex, gay violence, and other deviant sexual practices.<br />I was looking for morewellvisceral performances from these unknown authors.  Now I know why they are unknown.<br />The writings are amateurish and comical in their attempts to gross out the reader, but fall short because of the desperation that seeps from the pores of the pages.  Instead of a titillating blood fest or visceral discomfort, all they produced was sympathy for their pathetic efforts to raise sadistic sex and poop stories to the elevation of true revulsion or horror.<br />There are a few, and only a few, elements of this book that make it even worthy of a one star rating.  Cara Bruces introduction to the book itself is the most interesting part of this compilation of nonsense.  In it, she describes her feelings of numbness,and an inability to feel even pain, very common in clinical depression.  She describes going to extreme lengths in order just to feel anything at all.<br />When she put the book together, she says (quote from Introduction) I asked for sick stories.  I asked for murder, disgust, and of course sex.  I wanted pain, suffering, blood, guts, or just plain weirdness.  Instead most of the stories I got made me laugh.  They were so ridiculous I couldnt help it.I thought I had needed to feel more pain to heal, or to feel the pain I thought I deserved.  I didnt.  I needed to laugh.<br />This is the most well written and eloquent statement in the entirety of this 188 page mess.  Ms. Bruce herself wrote the only story in the book that contained even a hint at oddity with her tale called Cheng, about a dwarf with two mouths.  To give her due credit, she has also done a decent job of editing and putting together her compilation.<br />Honorable mention goes out to Sonia Greenfield for her tale A Girl On The Train, which brings a small amount of irony into the collection, notably about how deceiving looks can be.<br />And that is it.  Those are the only jewels to be found in this unsatisfying conglomeration, if they can even be called jewels.  More like lumps of coal.<br />Do yourself a favor and find a better collection if you are looking for horror or erotic horror or even strange horror.  If you want a Poppy Brite like journey into violent and graphic gay or deviant sex, then maybe this is for you.  It certainly wasnt for me.<br />To me it simply tasted bad.ith two mouths.

A far shot from great fiction, it still deserves a five star rating for capturing my wandering mind and even diverting me from my own writing.<br />Dr. Cherijo Grey Veil is a feisty well trained surgeon who flees her homeworld of Terra after finding that her father has not only betrayed her but endangered her by her very existence.  She takes a quick shuttle from Terra to K2 where she has accepted a position as a doctor in their free clinic, immediately immersed in treating all types of alien life forms she has never before encountered.  She begins her service there under the animosity and hostility of both the clinic's administrator and one of her fellow practitioners.  Things go from bad to worse.<br />She meets and falls in love with Kao Torin, an alien who Chooses her; and also a fellow Terran named Duncan Reever who was raised off world, who she cannot seem to get along with at all.  Other friends and enemies are formed among the habitants of K2 during her residency, including a previously undiscovered cluster of sentient beings that call themselves The Core.<br />Shortly after her bonding with Kao, he becomes infected with an unidentified contagion  and she is forced to save his life with dramatic measures, only to discover that they may not have been worth the price.  In the meantime, with her newly discovered telepathic ability with Reever, she must find the cure for the contagion.<br />Her obsessive compulsion to perform her oath as a doctor to the fullest, combined with her previously undiscovered romantic ability, to the clash with her fellow Terran, to the climatic confrontation with those who would persecute her; plus a not inconsiderable amount of medical intrigue and murder mystery, leads to a rapid fire reading pleasure that will suck you into her frantic and outlandish world and leave you turning pages as quickly as you can.<br />Nothing but warm hearted good old fashioned reading pleasure here, an escape that readers so often seek out, with a cross-genre combination that actually works in that wondrously mysterious way we readers find so pleasing in a purely fictional escape from our cluttered lives.

Living off estate money yet often running short, his decline on the steep side after the death of his father, he lives one day just as the last until his up-and-coming, successful, brother Prescott is killed.<br />Shortly following his death, his secretary Angie Wong is brutally murdered; and beautiful black Tanisha Williams from the LAPD Asian Crimes unit is called to the scene.  Tanisha grew up in the gang infested streets of the LA `hoods' and watched her five year old sister die from a gunshot wound.  She wanted to fight back by becoming a police officer but soon became untouchable on the force and under IA investigation when transferred to the Asian Crimes unit, the worst place for a black female officer.<br />Tanisha and Wheeler make a very unlikely team as the hunt begins for Prescott and Angies murderers; both of them out of luck and out of time and out of patience.  From LA to Hong Kong they search for clues to the murders, soon becoming targets themselves.<br />Interwoven into their desperate man hunt is the story of Fu Hai, an innocent man imprisoned for crimes his father did not even commit.  He finally frees himself from Khotan and step by step begins his journey to America, trying to `Ride The Snake' as an illegal immigrant.  His journey is brutal and degrading and yet filled with hope that he will be able to someday also free his sister who is trapped in poverty.  Fu Hai must sell himself to the tongs to ride the snake, and so his journey is a long series of hardships, deceptions, beatings, and illness.<br />With amazing descriptions of Hong Kong harbor, streets and ghettos, palaces and The Walled City, Mr. Cannell takes you on an incredibly face paced adventure in this non-stop action novel.  The suspense stays with you right to the ending, each page packing a punch.

McCammons characters are fully fleshed out and complete, his vision of the desolated terrain and the behavior patterns of those who survive are terrifyingly realistic.<br />There is Sister Creep, a bag lady with a tragic past who escapes immediate death by sleeping deep under the subway tunnels of NYC.  Young Swan Prescott, only nine years old, on the run from another 'uncle' in her mother's life, who has an uncanny knack for growing plants.  She survives the initial blasts in a dirt cellar out back of a run down country store called Paw Paws.<br />Roland Croninger survives because he and his parents are vacationing in the one and only survivalist vacation facility called Earth House, which turns out to be not all it was cracked up to be.  Colonel James (Jimbo) Macklin, in charge of Earth House, a man with a demon in his head called The Shadow Soldier who he listens to more than his conscience.<br />Josh Hutchins, a giant of a man on his way to a wrestling match in Garden City when he meets Swan in Paw Paws cellar.  And The Man Who Liked Movies, who has many other names.<br />Others join them as they search for a place where they can build a life, some beautifully good and others diabolically evil.  Strange things happen along the way as they encounter other bands of survivors and ultimately fight the evil that wants to take over and kill Swan.  There is a glass crown filled with jewels which gives off a shining light when held in the right hands, there is a mysterious growth that covers the faces of some but not of others, and always there is the menace of The Man Who Liked Movies.  The action is non-stop, and when the good collides with the bad they all find themselves in a horrifying deja-vu situation.<br />One of McCammons strongest points as one of my favorite writers is his characterizations.  He has the ability to bring the people fully to life and stir your emotions to either love or hate them.  I believe that Swan Song is his crowning achievement, a definite must for those who enjoy the End Of The World stories.  This one is worth full price; pick it up and ENJOY!life and stir your emotions to either love or hate them.

Both are virgins, though Lissa is not a puritanical one.<br />When Lissa catches Cassie kissing her bartender boyfriend Radu, she first shoots him then shoots herself, killing them both.<br />Cassie falls into a pit of self blame and despair, and to ease the burden on both her and himself, her father quits his job and moves from D.C. to the suburbs of Virginia into an old and odd mansion called Blackwell Hall.<br />Here is where Mr. Lee's real vision begins.  Cassie has no idea she is an Etheress, a living mortal with the ability to enter hell, until she befriends three dead people who are living in the occulus room of Blackwell Mansion; Via, Xeke, and Hush.  Part Two of this book is Cassie's journey into hell with her new friends, as she tries to find her sister to tell her how sorry she is.<br />Part Three of this book is where Cassie has a confrontation with Lilith, meets the second Fallen Angel Ezoriel, and uses her Etheress powers to invade the Constabulary to attempt to rescue her sister.<br />The weak parts of this novel are the dialogue, and to an extent the characters.  But, and this is a very big BUT, Mr. Lee more than redeems himself with this utterly unique and diabolical vision of hell as a vast city, The Mephistopolis.<br />I was literally blown away by the detailed visualization of this city; from transportation to power plants to nightclubs to policing to restaurants, Mr. Lee leaves nothing out from this hellish excursion.<br />It is truly in and of itself worth reading this book to travel with Cassie, Via, Xeke, and Hush into hell.

R. Martin's Wild Cards series.  F. Paul Wilson has done a brilliant job of editing this strange foray into the world of the Circus Freak.<br />With authors like himself (F. Paul Wilson), Richard Lee Byers, Dan Simmons, Rex Miller, Nancy Kilpatrick, and many others each dedicating their talents to a single chapter of the Ozymandias Traveling Circus and Oddity Emporium's journey across the US, focusing on a particular freak and his particular talent; the life that pulses through this amazing collection is realistic and...well...freakish.<br />Year's ago, Oz's father scattered pieces of a peculiar machine all across the countryside just before committing suicide.  Now Oz, a freak himself, has gathered those around him who are like him, different in some way or another.  Some with green skin, some with wings, or beaks, or fur, or two faces, even enormously fat or with eerily long fingers; they all fit in with Oz and called the Freak Show home.  Oz has promised them that their turn in life is coming, when the freaks will become the norm and the normal people will become freaks; all they have to do is gather and assemble the pieces of the machine his father scattered about years ago.<br />As we cross the country with this Oddity Emporium, the various authors bring us into the lives of these people, sometimes horrifying and sometimes tender; and we learn what it is like to be them, to feel like them, to live like them.  I found myself extremely caught up with this band of outcasts, sympathetic for some and not for others, but always compelled to read more and find out what and who Oz really is, and what will happen if his task is completed.<br />Though I felt the ending was a bit cheesy and fell short of my expectations, it did not do so enough to spoil the overall experience of this book.  Not since Dean Koontz's Twilight Eyes have I enjoyed a carnival/circus book so much, and it is too bad the F. Paul Wilson has said he will not edit another compilation such as this.  Personally, I think it is his greatest work.ed a carnival/circus book so much, and it is too bad the F. Paul Wilson has said he will not edit another compilation such as this.

Cows was not the pleasing, ripely rotting delight of the connoisseur of gross and depraved literature.  Not only did it go too far into bestiality and homosexual depravity, but it seemed to me that the author was on a mission to obtain the highest occurrence of the C word in a short novel.  I found the word boldly but inappropriately used.  The entire psychotic reality of a herd of intelligent cows living beneath the city was never utilized to its fullest but merely played with as a springboard for cow/human sexual relations.<br />It could have been more, it could have been the most disgusting novel I have ever read, but fell short in its juvenile meanderings.  The whole poop eating thing is something second graders yell at each other during recess, and did not come across as horrifying but merely gross and overdone in the lack for anything more imaginative.<br />You will not be disappointed in the psychosis of his bizarre girlfriend Lucy.  In her I believe this young author has found his ticket into the mind of the truly depraved, and should he write more novels, exploring further the mind of this twisted and sick young woman, he could very likely produce something far scarier than American Psycho.<br />And the entire slaughterhouse scene was more horrifyingly and truthfully described in Upton Sinclairs The Jungle. What tries to come off as horrifying winds down to merely disgusting, and not in an OMG kind of way, just mildly displeasing.  I would like to see this young author throw away the bestiality and poop scenes and use of the C word (except when absolutely warranted in order to bring your shocking points across) and focus on his use of Momma and Lucys personalities into a truly horrifying and disgusting tidbit of mind candy for those depraved readers out there such as myself.<br />This novel is not for anyone faint or light of heart or mind.	2003-10-21

(and I do mean tiny, very thin)  In my opinion, horror should be in-your-face; a fast, slap-happy read that leaves no doubts about what just happened.  Lee gets a little bit, well, ethereal in this chapter book.  A kind of wandering, dreamlike prose that belongs in space-type SF and not flat horror; for this book does contain some of the most gruesomely described horror I have ever encountered, definitely not for the faint of heart.  The stories are still good, and the book is thin enough to read while waiting for a dentist appointment, but if you want something juicier in content and not just an indistinct wade through knee-high gore and splatter, pick up a different Lee and save this one for the waiting room.<br />Goddess of the New Dark Age:  A story of a man dying of cancer, and of the ghost who follows him , whispering to him, as he seeks the meaning of what is real.  Only in death will the ghost make reality clear to him.  This is the best story of the three.<br />The Seeker:  A man wanders through a quarantined zone, seeking truth and finding only revolting people and horrific acts of violence.  When he does find what the army and he himself has been seeking, he discovers that he is capable of handling it when others are not.  This is the most vague, and yet the goriest, of the three.<br />Pay Me:  A man finds an old school mate in a Live-Sex bar, and witnesses her involvement in a pornographic stage show.  Still wanting to see her, he gets involved with her only to find out she will recruit him for the show in horrible fashion.  This is the most sexually graphic of the three, better than The Seeker but not as good as Goddess.	2003-09-05

I am a fan of the horror genre, and this is quite an extreme example; but with a refreshing approach.  It is the women who are effected by a strange toxic spill, not only causing them to become violent but also loosing their real selves in the process.  Kind of like horny, hungry female zombies.  They begin to attack all of the men only because they are men, but also when they sense a woman has not changed with them, is not like them, they attack her too. The one thing I felt should have possibly been expanded on is the fact that it is the women who are violent beyond control, in a society where men are suppose to never strike a woman.  I wonder how different it would have been in reverse; were the men effected I believe the women would have been even more violent in their defense.  Very interesting subject.<br />In a short 166 page story, Ketchum manages to bring his characters to life, and portrays one woman's transformation into something unknown even to her very well.  The focus of the story is one man's journey from his neighborhood bar back to his apartment to save his son...from his wife.<br />This book does contain some very graphic gore and splatter, so be prepared.  But it is a very fast read in that it moves like a movie through your head.  I could see this becoming a horror movie very easily.	2003-09-05

Especially the ?Wetbones?, where he calls down the Nameless Spirit to feast, leaving only a bloody, pulpy mass of wet bones for the detectives to bag up.<br />Garner is a Reverend, and a recovering alcoholic/crack addict who has not touched anything for years, who lives with his young teenage daughter Constance.<br />Ephram zeros in on Constance?s innocence and takes her with him, initiating her into his world of pleasure and punishment and control, forcing her to perform sadistic, brutal acts of pornography and enjoy it.<br />Prentice is a down-on-his-luck screenplay writer trying to convince a man named Arthwright to give him work.  His friend Jeff is already working with Arthwright, and this brings them together; along with the fact that Jeff?s little brother Mitch is missing and Prentice?s ex-wife was just found dead and mutilated.  Mitch was in JD until he cut himself up really good, and managed to get away from the hospital where he had been taken.  Jeff suspects Mitch has gone out to the Doublekey Ranch, home of Sam and Judy Denver.<br />As Ephram travels about with Constance in tow, leaving a mass of wasted and bloody bodies behind them, Garner goes in search of his daughter while Jeff & Prentice go in search of Mitch.  Garner sinks into the abyss of his own addictions, and Shirley manages to get extremely realistic in his portrayal of the crack addicts behaviors, thoughts, feelings, backgrounds, and needs.<br />Everything swirls towards a slick and gruesome ending, as Ephram lets Constance in on the secret of the Akishra, the wormlike spirits that feed off human beings, and tells her the dark past of the Denver's.<br />I really don't want to give too much away here, suffice to say that Shirley brings everything together in the end, though I was disappointed that Ephram did not have more to do in the end.  The editing is truly atrocious, but if you can skip past that this book will please any aficionado of the \\"blood and guts\\" genre, and the Akishra are spooky enough to throw a satisfying lump of SF into the mold.  I can't wait to read more Shirley.and tells her the dark past of the Denver's.<br />I really don't want to give too much away here, suffice to say that Shirley brings everything together in the end, though I was disappointed that Ephram did not have more to do in the end.

Her grandmother and long time friend Ben Ben-Zevi were once prisoners in the death camps, so she has many personal feelings about her job.  Adalwolf, however, is very aware of Melissa, and loves to play games with her.  His latest game getting her suspended from her job so that he can continue working on releasing the NTX virus he has developed that will target only people with Jewish heritage.<br />She and her husband David have been trying for years to have a baby, and after her suspension move to Florida to be near Ben-Zevi, who has found a doctor named Eric Brandt who believes he has found a way for Melissa to become pregnant.<br />Though she is suspended, she continues to work with her cohert Harris in attempting to track down Adalwolf, and when her leads get hotter and hotter, so does Adalwolf's determination to keep her away long enough for him to perfect his ultimate biological weapon.<br />This is a great book, but it is thinner and weaker than Pottinger's first two novels.  \\"The Fourth Procedure\\" and \\"A Slow Burning\\" were meatier, heavy, intense main courses; while \\"The Last Nazi\\" is more of a quick light snack.  It is still a good book, more in the fast go-for-the-gusto style of Stephen J. Cannell rather than typical Pottinger, but if you are going to the beach or taking a flight somewhere, pick this up and pass the time pleasently.	2003-08-25

Disch takes us through the lives of several people living at 334 11th Street, an apartment complex contolled by MODICOM; a modern day welfare system of social case workers.<br />The time frame jumps between 2020 and 2026, and especially in Part III the time frames jump from chapter to chapter, even with the same characters.  It got a little frustrating when something would happen to one of them, and suddenly you are back in a time frame with this same character that you read about already, 50 pages ago.  Some of Disch's characters are fully formed and multi-dimensional, but unfortunatly those are not the ones we get to see the most of.<br />Mainly, the story follows the Hansen's and the people they know and come in contact with in 334.  Despite not being the best story Disch has written, the prose and poetry of his writing is still very much present, and at only 250 pages this is still a good addition to your reading pile.	2003-08-11

With all the aplocalyptic books out there to enjoy, this is the freshest approach yet, and probably one of the older books.<br />One day the world is covered in little green plants sprouting up everywhere.  One month later the little plants are already over 100 feet tall.<br />Things fall apart too fast to stop them, and as they encroach on society, society collapses. Those who are left survive only by sheer determination and hard work, having not only to deal with the immense plants blocking out the sunlight, but with strange spheres that patrol amongst them and disintegrate anything that moves.  Disch takes us into this little society, and we follow this group of well formed characters onward through further declines, delving into an underground world of strange fruits and un-ending roots systems; where human nature takes over and even the smallest of societies finally breaks down under the weight of desperation.  The ending will may not shock you, but it will leave you thinking &quot;what if?&quot;<br />Very well written, outstanding characterization, this is one of Disch's better adventures.	2003-08-11

What a wonderful concept for this book, written by one of the \\"old masters\\" of SF, and a beginning that sucks you in and compels you forward....then drops you flat on your face where you pick yourself up and ask \\"Why did this book interest me again?\\"  Starting off with well rounded characterizations, and prose that takes us rapidly into some very bizarre lives; it ends with flat, paper thin characters, dialogue that is stilted and surrealistic when it shouldn't be, and the knowledge that what should have been accomplished was not.  The multiple characters had a compulsion to meld in the beginning, and in the end it is not even the characters we expected and they do not meld at all in my opinion, only mish-mash into a single character with a weak explanation of \\"themselves\\" as humanity.  Pah!  A mere 188 pages, this none the less took me three days to slog through.  Save yourself the trouble and pass on this one.	2003-08-01

This story is pretty much summed up in that one sentence, and from there we have flashbacks to his past when the power was strong broken with interludes in the present.<br />The problem is, David is never a sympathetic character, past or present.  He starts out shallow and finished shallow, never exerting any self control over his gift to better himself, and mourning it pathetically and placidly as it fades.  His relationship with his sister was horrible from childhood, where he made it unbearable for her, through his life.  It did intrigue me that his sister only seemed interested in his as his power faded, but her motive seemed more to rub it in his face than any actual familial concern.<br />There are a few really good parts, such as David's interview with the child psychologist, and only being 200 pages it is a very quick read, but don't expect too much insight into David or any of the other characters.  Silverberg is a master of SF, but I can only give this three stars for the unique idea and nothing for the actual content.	2003-08-01

Disch	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Not the usual medical thriller; imaginative and magical	Young Billy lives with his father and stepmother and younger half-brother Ned.  Billy is a loner, and different from other children.  He thinks a lot, and has a greater imagination.  He also has a streak of meanness, and when he is given a magical stick, with a dead bird tied to it, he finds that he can make things happen.  Occasionally, Billy will make something good happen, but most of the time his desires, in the form of poems, are mischievous to downright cruel.  After crippling his brother, causing his Grandma's hair to fall out, and stopping his step-mother from drinking by making her vomit every time she tastes alcohol.  Billy's odd obsession with bizarre games in his mind, starting with bowling pin armies and ending with his visions over the stick, fuel his imagination and need to keep using his \\"powers\\".  He gifts members of his family with good health, but his father dies in an accident.  Staying with his stepmother, he becomes a Doctor and has an affair with his step-sister, and decides that as a medical professional he can use his \\"magic\\".  But, will he use it for the good of mankind, or will his tendency towards cruelty lead him down a more sinister path?  Only the &quot;confusion&quot; at the end of the story stops this from being a 5 star book, it just seemed a little like Mr. Disch didn't quite know how to finish it.<br />This is a great book, jumping large time frames at times, and long on prose occasionally, but still manages to be a quick read for medical thriller lovers.	2003-07-15

The star of this novel is his unlikely protagonist, Herman Strockmeyer.  An older, unattractive, overweight attorney for \\"lost cause\\" clients against Government agencies, he is the David that takes on Goliath for the good of humanity.<br />With a serious heart condition threatening his life, he refuses to take time out from his cases because he is the only one who will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.  His lovely daughter Susan works with him, and during his investigation for his case against Gen-a-Tec and their biologically engineered corn, his assistant is savagely murdered.  Susan and Herman hire unlikely detective Jack Wirta, an ex-LA cop with a prescription drug habit, to find out why Roland was murdered.<br />This unusual trio of heros is what makes this book tick so loudly, Mr. Cannell's talent for bringing these people to life is the heart of the novel.  Our trio discovers much more than biologically engineered corn when their investigation of Gen-a-Tec pulls them into danger with DARPA, a black-op government agency that will do anything to hide their illegal and unethical genetics project.  As they run from one danger straight into the next, barely escaping time after time, you won't be able to let go until the conclusion.<br />Fast paced as all of Mr. Cannell's books are, this is a good story and a quick read with a truly likeable protagonist, and a highly recommended break from your stack of self-help and text books.

I have always been a fan of horror, and this was the book I actually read to my son that finally started him on his own road of reading for pleasure.  A young boy is unhappy with his life; he doesn't like school and doesn't like his parents, and wishes for a place where he can play all day long and have no responsibilities.  He finds that place when creepy Rictus leads him through the mists to a place he has always dreamed of.  Kindly old Mrs. Griffin runs a quaint little house, cooking marvelous meals for the boys and girls with her cats.  Harvey soon finds that this place is magical, every morning is Spring, every afternoon Summer, every evening is Autumn, and every night Winter.  The children play in the warmth of summer, have Halloween every evening, and Christmas every night.  He makes friends with Wendell and Lulu, and meets some freakish inhabitants.  But when he finally finds the lake with the strange fish, and witnesses Lulu changing, that he realizes this wonderful place is a trap and he cannot leave.  He seeks a way out, and with the help of Mrs. Griffin's cats he makes it through the misty barrier, only to find that for every day that passes in the House, a year passed in the outside world.  Harvey must set things to right again, and that means returning across the misty barrier and confronting the dreaded Mr. Hood.

We follow Susie, as she follows them, and tells us of her regrets, things she wishes she had done in life, and what she wishes for her parents and friends in their lives without her.  Only four stars instead of five, because toward the ending Ms. Sebold let the \\"fantasy\\" part of this book slip a little too far.  I enjoyed the story as Susie told it from her afterlife, but when she ventures briefly back into this world, I felt the reasoning was off and the concept unacceptable and a bit silly.  All in all, a pretty good book, worthy of four stars.	2003-05-27

Year Zero starts out with all of Mr. Long's talents on display, weaving his characters into a complex and horrific dilemma.  A new virus emerges from opening an ancient artifact from the year and location of Christ's crucifixion, that leaves no survivors and has eerie effects on those who are exposed.  We follow the paths of Miranda, an extremely gifted young girl who creates experiments with her genius but cold father; and Nathan Lee, an explorer who was lured into the illegal side of archeology by his sociopath brother in law, Ochs.  They discover a tremendous find, and Ochs betrays Nathan by pushing him to his death from a mountain top.  Nathan manages to survive by thinking of his young daughter Grace, and make his way down the mountain, only to be imprisoned for the murder of their mountain guide.  As the virus tears through continent after continent, Nathan Lee escapes and we follow his frightening journey back to America, where he searches for and finds the community of Los Alamos where he hopes against hope that his daughter is safely hidden.  Los Alamos is the last \\"clean\\" area, where scientists work against the clock and against each other, looking for the evasive cure for the dying world.<br />Unfortunately, this is where the novel pretty much just stops.  Nothing seems to happen, and Mr. Long lost me on where his plot was heading to, leading to an unsatisfactory ending with too many threads severed with no answers.  Nothing was ever solved with the clone made from the Year Zero find, hinted at being Christ himself.  Nathan solved nothing and Miranda solved nothing, and from the point he arrived at Los Alamos the book quite frankly just fizzled out.<br />Don't give up on Jeff Long, there is TALENT with this creative writer.  Pick up The Descent instead, and keep waiting as I do for his next novel.	2003-05-27

Amidst all the genteel southern hospitality and bubbling personalities lies a dark undercurrent of murder, and revenge from beyond the grave.  Nathan Redfield picked the wrong family to bully when he started in on the Larkins, a quiet and unobtrusive small family trying to eek out a living with a tiny blueberry crop.<br />Nathan is an abusive controller over everyone he meets, especially his brother Ben, but he hides it behind his slick southern veneer of politeness.  When he targets the Larkin farm, attempting to take it at whatever cost, he finally meets his match without ever realizing it.<br />McDowell so skillfully takes the reader into this hot, humid, languid town that you actually feel you are there, and that you are part of this small town and know these peoples habits as well as they do.  Superbly written and completely creepy, with frequent doses of terror and gore mixed with good ol' southern hospitality, you will find this book one of those \\"can't put it down\\" reads that leave you wishing for more.	2003-05-26

She is sold into bondage to the Night Court, first to Cereus House and then to a man named Anafiel Delaunay.  Anafiel recognizes Phedre for what she is, an anguissette, one who feels pain as pleasure.<br /><br />Anafiel raises Phedre, not simply training her to become a courtesan, but providing her with a high education and instructing her in the finer arts of espionage.  Once coming of age, Phedre enters the Courts with eagerness and elegance.  But before she can earn her \\"Bond Marque\\" to free her from servitude, her stylish lifestyle is disrupted by intrigues, which cause the deaths of two very dear to her, and threaten the entire land of Terre D'Ange.<br /><br />It is almost impossible to fully review this book, so richly woven with love, intrigues, lavishness, hardships, and magic, all told in first person by Phedre.  The prose is elegant without being pretentious.  The colorful characters from royalty to barbarians are full-fleshed and never flat.  The plot twists but never dries.<br /><br />Phedre's friend Hyacinthe, her \\"brother\\" Alcuin, her guardian Joscelin from the Cassiline Brotherhood, Queen Ysandre, and Phedre's enemy Melisande Shahrizai breathe life into Phedre's lengthy tale of her efforts to save Terre D'Ange.  No shrinking violet is Phedre; she is one of the strongest and most intelligent heroines you will ever encounter in a modern fantasy, a stunning and gentle beauty with a core of steel.  Indeed, her determination and willingness to survive, to do whatever is necessary to save her beloved land, is more than simply fascinating: it is riveting.<br /><br />Do not make the mistake of passing off this novel (and the sequels) as fluffy erotica or \\"chick fantasy\\".  This lush tale is filled to the brim with action and intrigue; you will not be able to put it down until the end.  Best have the sequels handy also; you won't want to let go of Phedre's tale even at the last page.  While this first in the trilogy stands alone, enough ties are left for interest in the second book, Kushiel's Chosen.<br /><br />'Kushiel's Dart' is an outstanding piece of fantasy fiction.

Miriam Blaylock is a Vampire, stunningly beautiful and intelligent, and very lonely. Centuries old, she is forever seeking one who will be her companion throughout time. Her current lover and companion is John Blaylock, only a couple hundred years old when he starts to age rapidly, showing the signs of degeneration Miriam has seen so many times before. As John deteriorates, Miriam prepares her next companion for the transformation, but John consumes her before she's ready. Desperate, Miriam impulsively chooses Dr. Sarah Roberts to be her next, for Dr. Roberts has been intensively researching aging and the human biological clock. Sarah's boyfriend is suspicious, and ultimately pays the price for investigating Sarah's strange behavior, but Sarah is not cut to fit the mold that Miriam plots for her.<br />An incredibly great tale of Vampires, who Sleep (with a capitol S) for about six hours a day, a coma like state where they are entirely vulnerable, but are able to walk about during the day and appear normal except for their hair and eyes, which the modern world covers up with contact lenses and wigs. Strieber brings Miriam's flashbacks to life, going back as far as ancient Egypt when Miriam was young, and bringing us the horrifying fact that Miriam keeps her lovers with her always, for they cannot ever die once they have been \\"transformed\\" for her.<br />A definite read for any Vampire fan, and recommended even if you are not.	2003-05-26

This is the first Jeff Long book I have read, and I will be reading Year Zero soon.<br />Long's underground world and underground society are very well described in this book.  The subterranean journey far beneath even the ocean floors is fantastic, scary, and interesting.  The psychological changes the parties go through is true to form.  He even had me looking over my shoulder for the Hadals.<br />I won't give anything away, but there are some very startling moments in this book that just blew me away and kept me reading through the night.<br />With a Himalayan mountain guide who goes into the abyss and returns scarred in every way, a beautiful nun teetering on the brink of faith, a group of Philosophers who begin to gather more frequently across the globe in search of Satan himself, an evil corporate head and his fiendish step son, a fanatical mercenary, an Army pilot who falls from grace through disfiguration, and of course the Hadals (underground tribes) all seeking their own prize from the sub planet, Mr. Long has brought a novel to us that you will be unable to put down until you finish it.<br />I highly recommend this book as an \\"all-nighter\\".	2002-11-26

Being a multi-genre reader, I have recently been going through Fantasy withdrawals after chewing up Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, and following it up with George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series.<br />Martin left me hungering for more good fantasy, and someone recommended this book.<br />If you are in the same frame of mind that I was, I caution you to avoid this book at all costs.<br />It has a great synopsis on the back, but the writing is so terrible that I could not finish it.  I did peek at the ending, and the writing did not improve.<br />Realistic dialogue does not exist in this book, what dialogue exists is stilted and extremely \\"Dick and Jane\\" in nature.  The punctuation is atrocious; missing periods, misspelled words, added question marks where they don't belong, etc.<br />A sample of the blending of descriptivism and dialogue straight out of the book is as follows:<br />\\"He could see the gate out of the graveyard ahead; he felt a sense of relief wash over him.  They had made it.  \\"We made it,\\" he said. \\" (page 21)<br />The writing is flat, stilted, repetitive, amateur, and geared to an \\"under 10 years old\\" crowd. It follows far too closely to a D&D theme, but as a comparison it would be like playing your D&D computer game on a 286 computer (circa 1990), jumpy and inconsistent.<br />The idea, and the storyline, are intriguing and would have been an excellent book if they had found a actual writer to pull it off, and an editor that could spell.<br />Ok, so if you are under 10, and a big D&D fan, you will probably like the book.<br />If you like writing that flows together, brings you into the world you are reading about, and involves you directly with the characters, leave this book on the shelf.	2002-08-01

Upton Sinclair was required reading for me back in the good ol' school days.  This was one book on the required list that I enjoyed.  It is a compelling and horrible story about turn of the century business practices and industry's complete lack of compassion for human beings.<br />I had forgotten how good it was and recently re-read it.  It is the story of Jurgis and his family, who immigrate to America, and who are misled from the very beginning, exploited by everyone along their path for the few pennies that could be squeezed from them.  They are charged for just being brought to America, then cheated on their home purchase, obtain jobs that underpay and overwork them, develop health problems from unsanitary and inhumane working conditions, are forced into poverty and to live and work in squalor, and finally they either die or their spirits break.<br />The story is heartbreaking especially because of all the truth that was included in it.  The meatpacking industry was indeed a brutal, unsanitary, and inhumane industry in the early 1900's, the new Industrial Processors had no incentive or reason to produce clean products or working areas.  Immigrants were pouring into the country by the hundreds and were seen only has disposable labor rather than human beings.<br />Wow, great book!  But then toward the end Mr. Sinclair does pull out his spiel on Socialism, which he was into at the time, and the pace of the book slows down a great deal.  Without this unwanted lecture on the wonders of Socialism, the book would have been a 5 star.	2001-11-30

This is the lives of people living in a small southern town in the late 1960's.  Before MADD and the tobacco lawsuits.  They are not educated and not rich, but the story definitely<br />As you read about the lives of Virgil, Bobby, Jewel, Puppy, Mary, and most of all Glen, you feel time take on a different meaning.  Their lives are not about obtaining wealth or recognition or even a state of comfort.  Their lives are about survival, in the only world known to them and the only world they will accept.<br />Time passes slower there, and sometimes it seems that all they do is ride around in their old cars for hours drinking beer and smoking.  But Mr. Brown brings their lives into clear focus whether you wanted to see it or not.  Virgil's regret at how he spent his youth instead of raising his sons better.  Bobby's yearning for Jewel and dedication to doing the right thing.  Jewel's desire for the love she thought she had in the past, her unhappiness at finding it never existed, and her determination to make a decent life for herself and her child.  Puppy's day to day struggle with just making a living, making peace with his father, and handling his own home life.  Mary's struggle with her own lost love and her dignity in bearing through years of sacrificing that love.  And then there is Glen.  His life is a chilling look at the mind of cold blooded killer, but from a different angle than most novels give.	2001-10-17

The characters in this book are very well developed, so that you almost feel you are living in the town with them.  The people from the good side and the bad side of town.  The two most dislikeable characters in town are of course from entirely different sides.  The richest man in town who is a greedy man born into family money, with no feelings for other people except for what they can give him.  In this era it was entirely possible to manipulate workers in your factory to do your bidding because you could fire people for any reason whatsoever back then.  And Rodney Harrington does just that.  He raises his son to be even worse than himself, with no regard for anyone except himself and what others can bring to him or give to him.<br />And Lucas Cross, from the poorest part of town, who drinks, beats his wife and children, and even worse.  These characters are painted well, and you will despise both for what they are.  There is the kindly doctor, the newspaper editor, the spinster schoolteacher, the crazy old lady and her cat, the busybodies, and more.<br />While not particularly shocking in this day and age, in the late 40's the small town issues that are addressed out in the open in this novel were strictly taboo to discuss at the time.  Constance and her carefully orchestrated lie about her past.  Poor Norman, who you know will never escape the clingy, desperate clutches of his mother.  Selena, who bears more than her share of tragedy with dignity.  Ted, who in the end lost his honor but was not even aware of it, becoming a replica of his own deceitful parents.<br />And Allison, who the book follows most closely.  She is the Daughter of Constance, and the story starts with her just entering high school and follows her through graduation and moving to New York for a brief period of time.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it seemed to pull me into the story of the town and kept me there by peeling back the layers of the town a little bit at a time.  Not an action packed book, but certainly not boring.  You will find yourself becoming involved in the characters lives,  and by the talent of good author you will either care a great deal about them or hate their guts.<br />As a footnote, to the questions regarding the Tom Makris/Mike Rossi issue, I have the 1956 paperback publication of Peyton Place, and Constance's husband's name is Mike Rossi.  The name change may have been done only in the more modern releases of the book.  Why?  I have no idea.peeling back the layers of the town a little bit at a time.

Lawerence picks this book up in 1987 and Anne is still in her thirties. Hmmmmmm. I wish it really did work that way. Her daughter Jennifer was born in 1963, and was only twelve in 1988. So Lawerence took extreme liberties with the timeline. Then, to make matters worse, she did not keep the characters basic personalities intact. The characters are mere 'shadows' (pun intended) of the richly developed individuals that Susanne brought to life in VOD.<br />The newer characters, such as Anne's daughter, Neely's son's, and Gretchen, were never developed at all, very shallow and boring. Lawerence should have stayed true to at least one of these themes, the timeline OR the characters, to keep the story of Valley of the Dolls alive, but she did neither. What we are left with is a poorly plotted and mediocre story that only has names in common with the original.	2001-09-24

You are drawn by the superb writing of Larry McMurtry into the world of Gus McCrea and W.F. Call, two retired Texas Rangers who decide to drive a herd of cattle from Texas up to the wild Montana territory.<br />The characters are so richly described, and yet remain simple in their ways. Gus, Call, Newt, Deets, Pea-Eye, Jake, Lorena, Clara, July, Bolivar, Lippy, Dish, Roscoe, Joe, and so many more. Even characters with small parts seem fully developed and all enhance the storyline. This novel is not just for readers of Western fiction, readers from all fiction types will love this book!<br />It is a story about people, about simpler and yet more violent times, about human nature and about the value of life.<br />There is much humor in this book (&quot;pigs on the porch just make things hotter&quot;) but it is not a 'fluffy' story. It is tragic and sad, you feel the depression and the hopelessness of some of the characters, and yet others bring you to feel the hope and humor of life in general.<br />So many things happen to the Hat Creek Outfit on their cattle drive north, Jasper's fear of crossing rivers, Dish's love for Lorena, Lorena's kidnapping, Newt's coming-of-age, stampedes, storms, death, Jake getting tied up with the bad Suggs brothers, Indian encounters, July's hunt for Jake, Roscoe's hunt for July, Clara's horse ranch, and so much more. It would make this review way too long. I can recommend this book highly, without reservation, to anyone on the basis that the story never falters, and the tale is so richly told that it will just sweep you away!	2001-08-29

This cookbook has lots of beautiful pictures, the recipes are easy to follow, and they also give a timeframe for preparation and cooking so you don't wind out starting something a little more difficult on a weeknight.  I followed most of the recipes exactly, with a few exceptions.  Since my husband is allergic to fish, I do not use fish oil and I substitute chicken for fish in some cases.  I also do not have a mortor and pestle so I cheat and use a spice grinder.  Still, the recipes came out just delicious, and I love the different regional dishes available.  This book gives excellent examples from many different asian regions.  Well worth the money in my opinion.	2001-08-20

First, I recommend reading this book before you watch the movie.  There are conclusions to be reached on your own before the Director's interpertation of the story.<br />Possible spoilers here, so read on at your own risk. Patrick Bateman is a successful Wall Street businessman in the materialistic 80's.  He is self-absorbed and materialistic himself.  He is also completely insane.  Mr. Ellis's ability to completely and realistically bring the reader into a mind that is mired in a psychopathic thought process is uncanny and unnerving.  Yes, this is a very disturbing book, for more reasons that just the gore everyone seems to focus on. My personal opinion, is that none of the murders actually happened anywhere except in Mr. Batemans mind.  There were some telltale indicators of this, in that one of his victims was actually seen in London, maids do not mindlessly wipe up blood and gore without saying something.  Body parts rot and smell, so he could not possibly have kept them in an upscale gym's locker. And his ranting, lunatic &quot;Thursday&quot; chapter is very disjointed, and psychologically more apt to have happened only in his mind rather than him running the streets like that in the physical world.<br />Mr. Bateman's obsession with what everyone is weariing is part of his sickness, but this shallow judgement of one's peers was accepted and even glorified in the 80's.  Not who you are but what you drive, and all that.<br />But does it make this book any less scary that these horrific scenes were carried out only in his mind?  I certainly don't think so.  By so completely capturing the psychopathic mind, Mr. Ellis has written a truly terrifying tale. This book makes you say &quot;Whew!&quot; when you finish it.  In one way, the trip was dark and you are glad to be out in the light again, but the other part of you that hates to see a really good and well written book end is sorry that it's over. It's gory, it's graphic, it's frightening.  It will make you really think about sanity and insanity, what is real and what is not real. I highly recommend this book.aphic, it's frightening.

It is written in &quot;first person&quot; perspective, but from five different people.  The victim, the murderer, the two cops hunting the murderer, and the profiler who comes in to assist on the case.  It is well written enough that without the characters name on the chapter you would still know which character was telling the story.  Excellent viewpoint, and extremely well executed. The storyline itself never falters, keeps you in suspense, and doesn't disappoint in the end. Sarah wanted to die, and John wanted to murder her.  Her ex-husband Robert is the first to find her, but not only can he not take the case because of the family relationship, he is also an alchoholic who is drinking far too much.  It's up to Lane, his partner and ex-lover, to find the killer.  She brings in her father, a retired profiler, to assist her. Very good murder/mystery/thriller.  I highly recommend it.	2001-07-21

I am a fan of Jeffrey Deaver and he did not disappoint me with this new novel.  It was a very fast read, and entertaining until the end.  I really liked our two heroes, convict and cop.  The villains were not well hidden in the plot, and the ending left one villain out and unpunished, which to me is always a letdown, but maybe it is to leave an opening to bring these characters back in another book.  The characters do outshine the plot, especially towards the ending, and the fate of Phate (pun intended) was very anticlimactic.  Being a Systems Analyst, I can tell you that it is very true that this book is technologically incorrect, but remember that it is fiction, not a manual, and it written to be entertaining instead of factual and boring.  The technical liberties keep the pace of the book moving along and allow for the plot twists and turns that we all love from Deaver.  The only actual surprise for me was when it was revealed who Shawn really was, but none of the lesser aspects I have mentioned detracted from the overall enjoyment of reading this novel.	2001-06-21

I would also mention that there were too many loose threads left at the ending, as some other reviewers commented on.  Compounding the loose threads on the plot, none of her characters ever actually \\"bloom\\" as they do in her other works.  They seem to stay exactly as they were introduced.  More should have been done with the ex-husband also, this could have made an intriguing sub-plot and would have made the book much more interesting.<br />Still, even not up to her usual speed, this book deserves a positive review.  Mary Higgins Clark is a favorite for kicking back in a comfortable chair and breezing through her easy to read novels, a lot like Sidney Sheldon.  With the mix of reviews on this book, running from \\"absolutely loved it\\" to \\"boring\\", I would say that if you like other Mary Higgins Clark books, you will like this one.  If you have never read Mary Higgins Clark before, pick up an earlier novel to read first, and enjoy!	2001-06-21

Emily is a physicist who has finally figured out how to power a large city using only the atoms from a glass of water. Nuclear Fusion. No more power crisis, no more outrageous oil prices.  She is not after money or glory or fame, she just wants to build the machine.  For a character to be antisocial, terribly shy, and a genius you would think that they would also be hard to care about.  Bari Wood really brings Emily to life although she is all of the above.  You cannot resist rooting for this woman because she is entirely unselfish and is determined to bring her discovery out because of what it would mean to the country and the consumer, not to herself. The Corporate Bad Guy is indeed bad, heartless and intelligent.  The character of the President was very well done, appearing hopeless and helpless until you realized he was hiding intelligence and a steel determination. Emily's true nemesis, a boy she does not even remember from school grown into a unfeeling monster with a pathological need to hurt Emily for a perceived insult to him years ago, one she is completely unaware of having committed. The pace of this book is fast, the action never stops.  The characters are very well filled out, some chillingly so as in the case of David.  I highly recommend this excellent book!	2001-06-21

I first read all of her books back in the 70's, when their shock value was much greater than today. I picked up all three again when they were re-released and have thoroughly enjoyed them all over again.  Susann is the bottom of the junk-trash novel and yet her stories are compelling and interesting.  Maybe just for the lack of character all of her characters have.<br />Dolls starts in New York, where Anne, Neely, and Jennifer have all arrived to climb the ladder of fame and fortune.  Anne takes a job with a theatrical attorney, and meets both Neely and Jennifer through her job.  They become friends, and so begins their story.  From New York to California to Paris, they all become successes and all have to deal with their own deamons.  With Neely, it's her drive for success and her addition to drugs.  With Jennifer, it's her greedy family and her conviction that her body is the only asset that she has.  With Anne, it's her cold, sheltered childhood and her obsession with a self-centered egotistical man.<br />The other character I must mention is Helen, the Broadway star, who is professional and revered on-stage and a sniping, childlike, phony off-stage.  She pulls Anne into her web briefly, but her hard edged tactics soon push Anne away. They reach amazing highs, fall into abyssmal lows, and all crash hard.  Yet this book remains an amazing read, you can't put it down though your mouth is gaping open at the excessivness of it all. Plus, it is more enjoyable to this generation, I think, because of the very real environment of the area it was written in. Definately worth price, and don't feel guilty for enjoying it!!	2001-01-23

Starting fast, at the very beginning of the book, Mark is taken by lightening back to prehistoric times.  He begins to wander, looking for civilization, and the pace stays pretty brisk and he encounters one trouble after another.  I thought the pace of the book slowed though, as his endless trek dragged on and on with pretty much the same fears and thoughts being repeated. Then Mark meets up with Um-See, and the book takes off again.  I think Mr. Gray did a decent job at portraying the thoughts and actions of this tribe of people.  The &quot;communication with the present&quot; part of the ending should have been left out.  It contributed nothing and somehow made what Mark accomplished with Um-See's tribe seem less important.  All in all, still not a bad read.	2001-01-23

I first read Jacqueline Susann's novels back in the 70's, and I am glad they are re-released today. Susann's women are beautiful, tragic, shallow, greedy, talented, lucky in career, unlucky in love, vapid, immoral, weak, and as a result often unlikable.  So why can't you put the book down?  Because Susann brings this world right into your lap, and you follow along the paths of these women and their successes or failures.  You wind out hoping with them or against them.  The men are either horrible, egotistical brutes or wimpy, whiney nobodies.<br />Our leading man, Robin, is a cold blooded woman hater in the guise of a lover-boy.  He methodically goes through women like kleenex.  And our first leading lady, Amanda, is pathetic.  She is a top model, beautiful and rich, and yet whines and simpers over Robin.  She is obsessed with him and does everything she can to please him.<br />Maggie is a dark haired beauty, who marries for status and money to a man she finds out is abusive, but still doesn't leave the marriage.  Instead, she has a one night stand with Robin, gets pregnant, and then leaves her marriage after her husband beats her to where she looses the baby.  She also becomes obsessed with Robin and when meeting him again, even though he doesn't even remember her, she leaps back into his bed and thinks that he is going to be with her forever.  Think again.<br />Judith is perhaps the most pathetic of all.  She's fifty-ish, still beautiful, married to one of the most powerful men in Television Networking, and yet with everything she has she still feels that she is a poor little girl that deserves more.  She also falls for Robin, and uses her power in the industry to try and manipulate him to her side.  Not to mention getting a face lift to attract Robin while her husband recuperates from a heart attack.<br />The revelation about Robin's past would be tragic in any other scenario, but with Robin being such a miserable example of a man you just couldn't care less.<br />So why read this book?  Just to enjoy yourself.  Susann's trashy, campy novel develops full characters (even if they are unlikable) and sucks you into the fast pace and glamour of showbiz.  Ethel, a side-line character, keeps the pace moving too with her own sexual entry into the glamour world, winding out as MRS SOMEBODY eventually.  Dan, once at the top and barely more likeable than Robin, is interesting to follow through his own career ups and downs.  Read it and enjoy!/>So why read this book?  Just to enjoy yourself.

Although the storyline held great promise, the writing was juvenile and the characters were shallow and therefore not very likable.  Although our lead character &quot;jumps&quot; quite a bit, there is no magic in what he does, nothing original or unique at all.  I was very disappointed in this book.  If you want to read a truly great &quot;traveling&quot; book, get Ken Grimwood's 'Replay' instead.	2001-01-23

There is a letdown involving a nice character at the beginning, and a very delightful twist at the end with a nice character. The ending is very sad, thinking of an innocent life wasted at the hands of abuse.  Very tragic and heart breaking. But another character, Meagan, we get to watch develop and grow every time we turn a page.  She is a real hero to herself.  The ending had a small twist, not up to the caliber of other Deaver novels, but I still enjoyed reading this book.  Deaver has a skill in portraying his characters that make even his lesser works quick and exciting and easy to bite into.	2001-01-23

The characters in this book all come alive, you meet them, some you like and some you don't.  But they all develop and grow, some in a good way and some in a bad way.  There are enough twists to keep you reading straight through.  The &quot;near misses&quot; that Shane seems to encounter constantly kept me on the edge of my seat.  This isn't the first cop story that exposes corruption in high places, but I think that the resolution that Mr. Cannell gives his story has a more realistic ring to it than most.  And you can't help but like Shane and Alexa's approach to &quot;information gathering&quot;. A fast, fun, engrossing book to read, one of Mr. Cannell's best!	2001-01-23
US	52859935	R371RYPY5EFSEX	0802135455	422340786	Once Is Not Enough (Jacqueline Susann)	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Not as good as Susann's other novels	I first read Jacqueline Susann back in the 70's, and am glad these books have been re-released. This is my least favorite of Susann's &quot;Trash Trilogy&quot; of books,  probably because it has the most tragic ending, but it is still worth the read for the shocking behavior of her characters.  Especially when you take into consideration the era they were written in.<br />Once Is Not Enough is about January Wayne, a very spoiled girl who has an unnatural attraction to her own father.  A self-centered man who was not around enough as January grew up in boarding schools. January really does suffer, she is in a horrible accident and spends three years recovering.  She joins her father and his new rich wife in New York, and wonders what to do with her life since she cannot have her father.  She goes to work with an annoying schoolmate at a magazine, and her life on her own begins.<br />She is courted a good looking man who is in love with another woman, and then meets Tom Colt when she is assigned to interview him for the magazine. Tom Colt replaces Daddy for her, and she falls hard for this older, rude, hard drinking, and married man.  I had to snicker at Tom's &quot;little problem&quot;, I think every woman did.<br />Karla is kind of an enigma, and definately the most interesting character in the book. Everyone is unhappy, and just when Mike, Dee, Karla, and January seem to be on the brink of getting it together and doing someting to make themselves happy, tragedy strikes.  A plane crashes, and like dominos, the lives that are left slowly crash also.<br />Of all Susann's novels, drugs are never portrayed in a positive way, and Once Is Not Enough probably brings the worst into play, because January is more innocent that Susann's other drugged heroines.  So of course, she falls quicker and harder when she finds them.  Good campy trash, fun to read, and well written as usual in wonderful Susann style.	2001-01-23

Ok, I feel like I should apologize, but I absolutely love Stephen J. Cannell.  I can't wait for The Tin Collectors to come out!  He writes easy to pick up, hard to put down, good ol' fiction!  What I appreciate is the way he writes his books all on vastly different subjects, like Michael Crichton does.  He doesn't follow just one template and re-vamp it for every novel.<br />The Devil's Workshop is a novel of biological threats, a mad scientist, a beautiful woman, and Trains!  I loved the train part! I was suprised by the revelation about our rail-riding friend in the book, but I'm sure not everyone was.  Plot twists, engaging dialogue, and action from start to finish make this a book I highly recommend for an entertaining weekend read.	2000-11-16
US	52859935	R1SSS6MX7XTPSR	0812561880	819512970	The Protocol	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Not too bad	I don't like using the word mediocre, but that is pretty much what the book is.  An evil, powerful man is responsible for the death of the lead characters husband and child, and she sets out to frame him and get revenge.  How she gets close to him is unrealistic, but this is fiction.  There is also an ex-CIA agent working for a competitive company also attempting to get some info on the bad guy.  They wind out working together to bring him down.  But the plot falls short in action, and the demise of the bad guy is too abrupt and &quot;distant&quot;, even though that was the actual point of all the predicaments the lead characters engaged in.  The ending does stop short, leaving too much left undone, but don't write off this author yet.  I think she has shown promise of better works to come.	2000-11-16
US	52859935	R2SWJSI8Q08O0F	0915230151	227982398	The Mirror	Books	4	200	208	N	N	An interesting tale,  don't miss it!	On the eve of her wedding, Shay looks into a very ugly mirror that is a family heirloom, and finds herself waking up on the floor of her room.  But wait, it's her room but where is the carpet?  She finds herself trapped in the body of her Grandmother, Brandy, on the eve of Brandy's wedding.  To all else she is just crazy Brandy, and the differences between Shay and Brandy (like Shay loving milk where Brandy always hated it) go unnoticed or written off to Brandy's unstable character. Brandy/Shay is promptly wed and sent away from the only familiar place Shay knows, to a small cabin in a remote town.  Here she starts her new life as Brandy, living with Thora K., one of the books most endearing characters.<br />Shay must adjust to a world almost 100 years in the past, and adjust to her life as Brandy, while still trying to coax the mirror into returning her back to her modern life and self. That the mirror is evil becomes apparent, but that doesn't stop Brandy from trying until she realizes finally that she belongs where she is.<br />The book has 3 basic parts:  Shay living her life as Brandy, the life of Rachel her mother/daughter, and Brandy living her life as Shay.<br />I first read this book a long time ago, and I still have my original copy.  I have re-read it many times, each time as enjoyable as the first. This is an excellent book, wonderfully written.  It has a lot of humor in it which I found refreshing.  I definately enjoyed the first part of the book, Shay as Brandy, better than the latter half which was Brandy as Shay.  The characters in the latter part lost a lot of the luster and depth that her characters from the past had.  Still, an excellent read.  I recommend it.	2000-11-16

I haven't read a book that made me think about consequences and opportunities so much since James Halperin's 'The Truth Machine'.  In some cases where he has been with a person for one of his &quot;lifetimes&quot; and &quot;replays&quot; again only to meet that person young and unaware of the lifetime they just spent together, you can understand and feel just how creepy that would be.  Ken Grimwood tells a story that entertains with a unique plot and realistic, lifelike characters, and you find yourself feeling exactly what the characters are going though emotionally.  He really pulls you into the story and the lives of the characters, while you are contemplating what you would do in this scenario. The twist at the end is a little suprising, but won't leave you hanging or disappointed.  This is one of the few books that I would give 10 stars if I could.  Definately worth every penny!	2000-11-16

But this novel seemed a little too predictable, a little too &quot;cut and dried&quot;, and the characters never fully developed into what they could have and should have been.  Plus there was no feeling of satisfaction at the end, no good follow ups to the leftover threads from incidents and even characters that were only partially developed in the story.<br />However, I do love Sidney Sheldon, and all of his books do indeed offer up a quick, fast getaway that is enjoyable and easy to get into.  If you are a first time Sidney Sheldon reader, I recommend some of his better books, like Master Of The Game, Bloodline, and If Tomorrow Comes.	2000-09-26
US	52859935	R1DGU6VQ4I44RK	0684852853	974831720	The Coffin Dancer (A Lincoln Rhyme Novel)	Books	3	11	12	N	N	Enjoyable, but not Deaver's best	I actually rate this at 3 1/2 stars. I read Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme novels in the wrong order. I started with Empty Chair, followed with Bone Collector, and finished with The Coffin Dancer.  Of the three, I would have  to say this is my least favorite.  Don't get me wrong, it is still a great  read and I still recommend it!  But the beginning is so much slower than  the other two books that it fell below my expectations.  I also believe  that this book leaves Rhyme a little colder than he is in the other two  books, which is kind of disappointing because this is the book that also  builds up Sachs and Rhyme from co-workers to lovers. It took me awhile to  get warmed up to this book, and I found the characters more lacking.  Dellray comes across much weaker, but does have a great undercover scene  that did him justice.  I felt that Percey came across not so much  strong-willed and independent like Deaver wanted, but more self-centered  with disregard for anyone around her.  Which to me, didn't make her very  likable. (But then again, not all people are likeable, are they?) However,  Deaver did not disappoint me when it came to the twists and turns that make  his books so enjoyable.  If this is the only Deaver book you have read,  don't judge by this book alone.  I still can't wait for Deaver to write a  fourth book with Lincoln &amp; Sachs on the scene!	2000-06-01
US	52859935	R3066GR24FJR95	0804108595	564795538	Stone Heart	Books	4	14	15	N	N	Very Good, Very Sad, A worthwhile read	The Stone Heart is one of the most heart-wrenching books I have ever read.  Very good book, but get ready to cry.  It is the story of horrifying domestic abuse, and how hidden that abuse really is.  Luanne Rice brings  into her story all the aspects of Domestic Violence too, how it affects the  children and immediate family, and how family will often fight to keep it  under wraps.  The excuses, the denial, the hopelessness, and the immense  pain that abuse brings are all very present in this book.  She brings up  the dysfunction and trauma of the early years of both the abuser and the  victim, and brings into the light the mental cruelty along with the  physical violence that eventually culminates in the worst case scenario of  all domestic abuse, death.  Although she delves deep into the pain and  horrors of domestic violence, I felt she barely skimmed the surface of the  agony of suicide, especially when those left behind are children.  She does  minimally portray the confusion from a death such as this, but I felt  should have spent more time on this aspect of abuse since she did such a  good job portraying all other aspects.  Stone Heart is far more brutal than  say, Belva Plain's Whispers.  But the most horrifying part of this story is  that although it is fiction, in real life this does happen in varying  degrees from just the mental abuse all the way up to what unfolds in this  book.  Maria, our lead character, is no hero either.  She struggles with  her own personal problems and problems with her dysfunctional Mother, and  often does not have the answers.  But this is just another way the Luanne  Rice stays close to reality in this book, because Maria does keep trying  whether she is right or wrong. There is a kind of sub plot to this book  that a previous reviewer took offense at.  It does involve the excavation  of ancient grave by Maria, but I wouldn't read into it all that nonsense  about this book being racist. The uncovering of the ancient grave is a real  sub plot (Maria is an Archeologist) but it is also a metaphor for the  uncovering of her own family secrets, and things about herself, her sister,  and her family that maybe should have been left buried.  It is a small sub  plot and actually is historically inaccurate, but if you want a historical  document then go and buy something that doesn't say &quot;Fiction&quot;.  This novel is a very emotional journey through one family's encounter with  hidden, and yet extreme, domestic abuse, and although it will anger you and  also make you cry, it is a definite worth-while read.real  sub plot (Maria is an Archeologist) but it is also a metaphor for the  uncovering of her own family secrets, and things about herself, her sister,  and her family that maybe should have been left buried.

Michael McDowell can write a creepy book.  The relaxed and languorous atmosphere of the South combined with a horrifying, yet mystical creature, who hides among them and settles in with them.  Through the 6 book series you can really feel the passing of time,  as some characters age and some of them die.  The Caskey clan is truly  dysfunctional and you are inexorably drawn into their lives.  You'll have  to scout the used book stores for this series, but it is well worth it.  I  re-read these books about once every 24 months.  Don't confuse this Michael  McDowell with others, he only wrote the Blackwater series, Katie, Gilded  Needles, The Elementals, and The Amulet.	2000-05-17

Philo is a true heroine, Katie is unbelievably evil, and then who hasn't known a person who resembles Jewel?  The Slapes will leave  you dumbfounded at their callousness, and you will find yourself cheering  every time Philo overcomes some other obstacle in her path.

As the book starts out you get a funny feeling about some of the characters.  Well, you are right, but keep reading.  The characters unfold and the plot twists and then twists again, and you are  left wondering just what is the truth and who can you believe.  I love  stories that keep up the action while throwing curves at you to keep you  guessing until the very end.  This is the third book in the Lincoln Rhyme  series, and in my opinion, is the best to date.	2000-05-17
