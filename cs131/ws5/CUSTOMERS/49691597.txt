I read them all, and yes, I was happy that sookie and her boss got a little lips action, but Eric and Bill are my top concerns. I like calvin but he needs to move on to some other creature. Bill is kinda weak and Eric well Eric is never anywhere around when the real Stuff hits the fan, he always has someone else to do his bloody work. I still say Eric needs his own story. I lovvvvve Eric. and the Weres well, now that was an excellent story. and I cracked up over the Fairies. Poor Sookie and all the men who want to get with her. who to choose, who to choose.	2005-07-07

I don't consider my self a christan, not do I consider my self of any religous organization. I find christans to be to judgemental and preachy. I did however, enjoy the parents in the book. You would have thought with the parents she had she could have handled her situation a bit better. I don't know, this is a hard one to really write a review about, I felt for the husband and his situation and I had empathay for the wife and children.<br /><br />Had I know that this would have been the kind of book it was I would not have read it.  I did finish the book, however, there were times where I just wanted to put it down or I wanted to skip ahead to find out what was going to happen.<br /><br />Again the book was very well written, and the author did her thing.  I do think it is a book that is needed.	2005-05-31

Remember how it's said that God created man in his own image? Well, Mr. Colfer must have created Artemis in his image, when Artemis become a real man then he will be Mr Colfer's image re-created, or at least in the image I picture Artemis to be.<br /><br />I just want to say if Mr. Colfer ever comes to your city or town take the opportunity to go see him Funnnnny guy. I wish I could have had enought nerve to ask him questions about his book and his self, but because I was the only adult black person there I felt...well a bit out of place.<br /><br />I had such a wonderful experience just hearing him speak in his wonderful Irish brogue. He was delightful. Enough about Eoin.<br /><br />Artemis Fowl Book 4 does not disappoint, it was just as good as the other three. I am loving Mulch, he always come thru. Good book, good series.<br /><br />Next time I don't care,I am going to say somthing to Mr. Colfer.	2005-05-31

I have meet Mrs Cooper, and I can say that she is as colorful as the people she writes about. I loved every single book she has every written. I wait in anticipation for her book signings. So, just know that I am an avid J. California Cooper reader. However, I have to agree with one reader RachLuv, when she says that this book was not all that. When you are the author of the book \\"Wake of the Wind\\" you have fans for life, however, when you are the author who writes a book \\"Some People Some Other Place, and it's just not what you expected in your favorite author then you have some disappointment. She did state at the beginning of the book that she had been ill, so maybe this has somtething to do with this book.<br /><br />The book like most of her books are about the poor black family, yet in this book it was more and nothing, it was preachy, not comitted to anything really. What did I learn from reading this book, nothing. It was not a good read. I felt sorry for every person in the book, and even at the end of the book I could not enjoy the so called happeness of Eula and her new man.<br /><br />Read it but it get from the library and take it right back. Sorry J. I still love your work and no book can ever compare to Wake of the Wind\\" I read it three time.	2005-02-05

I, like the rest of you all have read the other highlander novels. I was impressed, loved them and recommended them to many other people.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that I just didn't like this book one bit. it was constanly  going back to how beautiful Adam was, how scared she was, how beatutiful she was, blah, blah, blah, I was so sick of hearing about the beautilful this, his body builted that.<br /><br /> I get so sick of these females who you know are going to end up with the guy, why not make them die at the end, send a ripple thru the story. Okay so Moroganna died already, so what, Gabby did not deserve Adam.  I was just sick to death of it. Her whinning, her crying, her stuipd books with no facts. OooooH I'm so upset at how you did Adam.<br /><br />like the rest of you all again, I was happy that adam was finally getting his own story. But this was not his story.<br /><br />This was nothing but sex, lies, and nothing rolled into one book. Adam's story was all wrong. He is the Fairy Prince. There is no other Adam and for you to have done what you did to Adam was just down right wrong.<br /><br />I think in human life every one is looking for the perfect love of their life. But Adam was beyond perfect, was was great, wonderful without you making him fall in love and become some whipped love sick human. I hated that you did that to him.<br /><br />Okay, I can hear people saying, calm down, it's just a book, but book or no book the story was what kept us the readers coming back for more<br /><br />I don't care what Gabby looked like. ( ok, once, or twice, maybe even three time of her/his description was enough) we get the picture. Other world beautiful Fae Prince meets beauty bombshell. We get the picture already. Now tell Adam story the way it should be told.<br /><br />Gabby, well, I liked that she could see the fae, I loved the movements traveling back and forth through space and time, I loved that she brought the twins back, with their love sick selves. I like that someone wanted to kill Adam.but I never really understood the whys, and what happen to the Hunters. I can read sex and sex in other books.<br /><br />You made Adam to simple. Adam has never been easy nor has he in all your other books been simple.<br /><br />I love Adam Black's character and you made his story all wrong. Adam could shift time, he could make himself rich, glammor humans, write law briefs, (better than Gabby) he could do all this, and yet, you had the nerve to change his life the way you did. Oh no!!!<br /><br />I wish that Karen Marie M. would have put as much energy into telling the story, as she did in discribing the sex, the bodies, the hair, the dresses, the shoes, the pants, the car the etc.<br /><br />The story was nothing, I know I said this already but it truly was not the story I was waiting for.<br /><br />Damn!!!!!!sick selves.

It's so funny what you remember and what you forget. I didn't think he would even remember the incident at the airport but he did, and he told me to stop reading that book if it's making you act like this.

Yes, the story was powerful, and no you can't read this book fast or when you have something else to do. When you read this book have time because it is worth the time to read and complete.<br /><br />For me it took a couple of days because I didn't want the story to end.  Then you will put it down because you can't stand to find out if Bishop is going to live or die, or if his life will end in the mother land.<br /><br />The love scenes are fierce, so get ready for that.

This was the book, I read it non-stop. I was so happy to be reading another Anne Rice book, that made me laugh,get a surprise, and talk out loud. It just so happens I read Blood Canticle before this one so I had to go back and read dear Quinn's tales of woe. Damn he had nothing to complain about he was a rich, spoiled brat, very much like Lesat, that could be what lead to the attraction.  This book was a joy of words, and I wished there was more. I've got my fingers crossed.	2004-04-07

I wrote my review for \\"Club Dead\\", however, this is where the whinny starts. Sookie was strong and brave in book one, not that she's not in this book, but, if you doing someting bad and you doing it against a vampire, then you deserve death, sorry just my feeling. In book one Sookie meets a vampire, something she's been wanting to do when they(the vampires)began to mainstream. So she meets him, fall into sex, not love, trust me, it's all about the sex and the way he treats her which is excellent for a dead man. I know some men who are breathing and they don't treat you like Wonderful Bill,(that's his name). Well sookie and Bill go off to Dallas for a very interesting adventure. You read the rest.

The book was interesting and a quick read. I didn't like that here you are a woman in the 03 and you didn't think that your husband would sleep with someone else? You marry a man you know how he was raised but then you think that you are not going to have any issue with him? You are so self absorbed that you can't see that others around you are hurting? I don't get that,,,sorry. Like I said that book was good. however, I am just a little bit to pessimitic I guess. Then the baby,and the uncle, This man is too good. I mean it as a negative I mean like Wow, he was a really good man. the baby was cute. I like the unlikly love affair between the boss and the social worker they need their own story.

Women, (sigh) Paris is a push over, he gets his car stolen, his money stolen, his store burned to the ground, he gets the crap slapped out of hisself.<br />So he has to go bail his so called friend out of jail so that he can fight his battles.I must say Paris did end up having some smarts about hisself after all. Frearless, I liked Fearless but he was a little to wierd sometimes,taliking to dead white men and carrying on.<br />The most important part of the book...well the part that was important to me was Paris telling his story about how he came to be in LA.<br /> This white librarian from his home town, told him point blank you can look, but you will never be able to touch, cause these books are for white children and he would never be able to use that library as long as he was black she didn't care how good he could read.  So he left small, town USA and moved to LA where he said he could read all the books he wanted regardless of his skin color.	2002-09-01

I didn't know they were talking about real sisters, meaning nuns and colored meaning black.<br />I read ms. Guidry piece of fiction, at least I hope it was fiction. It was suppose to be told from the perspectve of a ten year old. Now, mind you a ten year old who just turns ten in the book and one who has the vocabulary of a forty year old.<br /> So a few events happen in this book but not much talk about the sisters. Most of the book (a lot of) talked about the ten year old family and a black cleaning lady and her daughter who lived down the road. Some parts were funny,some part sad. I must admit, I did like little Mavis, she fought hard not to adapt to the &quot;you black and I'm white theory&quot;, but her daddy, and sister, Vivian Leigh was not having that kind of none sense.<br />It wasn't until her sister pinched her after a really bad event that Mavis finally came to her senses, that god made white people and he made coloreds and you as a white person can not be best friends with a colored or the &quot;sheets&quot; will get you and hurt you.<br />The Year...when the Little Rock riots occurred. This way of thinking still exist and the year is 2002.<br />It didn't seem to me that anybody really changed because of the sisters they changed because of...well change.	2002-03-11

No matter, this is an intense, realistic, great story. As one reader stated in her review, the story made you dream about it while you are sleeping. Everthing was so vivid.<br />The last story Imago was the most interested one in the series, however, the other two in the series were just as wonderful. I so much enjoyed reading this book it was in my hand every chance my Boyfriend would let me have.<br />Sorry Anne no more vampires for me I want to grow up to be an Ooloi.<br />My advice, don't stop reading just because the stories are over read the author's note in the back of the book.<br />Enjoy, I did!<br />Peace	2001-12-30

Ike, bless his soul has many, many problems through out this book. I liked him. From the first page until the end. He was there in  your face. He was Rambo, Bruce Willis, and Arnold all in one. It took me a while to finish not because it wasn't interesting, it was, however, all that military stuff I could have done without, but the Satan thing was fun. I liked that the nun had a thing for Ike and Ike, (I just love this name glad it wasn't Jake) had a thing for the nun. Why is it when people think they are about to dye or maybe will dye,they can find time to make love. Brother! Whatever! Anyway, Good story, kind of slow, but good. the monsters, the fights, the deaths, all fun stuff.  Most people should like it for the Journey to the Center of the Earth Aspect.<br />I am looking forward to reading somthing else by him.	2001-12-18

I was hoping to add Mr. Strieber to this list. However, &quot;The Last Vampire&quot; is not on my, &quot;boy that was a great book&quot;! list. It was okay.<br />Girlfriend got out of some pretty tight spots and believe me when I say tight, only to find herself in love with the very half human thug who was the reason she is the title of the Book, &quot; The Last Vampire indeed. Yeah right!!<br />This woman has created a club so elaborate that I wanted to go there. She is rich beyond rich and she is in love with this sick moron. Gimme a break! Then to make matters worst...he is a washed up, washed out old vampire killer of the upmost. He and his killing crew were just getting on my last nerve. I wanted him dead in the first chapter.<br />Anyway, it got kinda of exciting, trying to figure out if he was vampire/keeper. Now we have to wait to see what's gonna happen with that damn baby.<br />Hurry up and write the story so I can get through reading about this stupid keeper woman.<br />I have to go read the &quot;Hunger&quot; now.	2001-11-08

What looks like crazy was a good story as well, but this one gives you more. I loved the connection between the generations, the younger sisters and the older sisters coming together to share ideas, laughter, conversations, and babies.<br />The story made me ask where are the men? What happen to the men in the community who use to have your back? Who would take care of the women and the children, what happen to the brothers? I like how she made them take responsibilty.<br />Some things were a tad be over discriptive, however, she's the writer and she told a great story.	2001-10-09

She was a healer of the utmost extremes. As I sat reading the book I couldn't help but wish I too could become this free forming shift changer healer woman. Fantasy, fiction, or imagination, I could care less, I wished that when my times got too hard that I could turn into a horse, a bird, or a fish. when the bills or everyday life seemed to much that I just wanted to scream I could just shift into a rich older woman and not worry about the bills or what ever. I loved this book becasue after all my wishing and hoping I was delighted that at the end of the book Anyanwu had adopted my name as her own. (you have to read the book to find out what my name is)As for the other person Doro I would not want to be him for a anything. His life was to unhuman. Anyanwu still retained all of her human quality even when she had to kill. thank you Ms. Butler for allowing my imagination  to soar. Peace	2001-07-14
