Of course, pointing out mistakes in the KJV only shows that its translators made errors.  Many of these errors are pretty trivial and many others turn out to be more symptomatic of the impoverished imaginations of those who dwell on such trivialities. Even if this book did refute the KJV, it wouldn't refute any other translation, nor would it make a dent in the ancient texts.<br />Still, this book is useful, not only for those looking to poke holes in what is one of the literary masterpieces of the English language, but for Christian apologists who try to explain such problems to unbelievers as why God's decision to drown the whole world was morally justified, while some man who wishes to imitate God by drowning a few of his morally depraved neighbors would not be morally justified in doing so.<br />The persistent ridiculing tone of the authors is distracting, but this book is a useful reference.	2003-12-30

This procedure is repeated until the end of this dreadful volume.<br />The book is so utterly useless, I suspect it was ghost-written.  It's hard to imagine a player of Karpov's caliber allowing his name to be associated with it; I mean, assuming it was ghost-written, how could such an incompetent ghost have the money to get Karpov to pretend to be the author?  <br />This book is not worth the paper it was printed on.

Although Erdos had many oddities, such as the inability to handle some of the most mundane tasks such as taking a shower without pointing the nozzle in the wrong direction and getting water all over the floor, he was a very charming and lovable man, unlike, for example, John Nash throughout much of the latter's life.  <br />I think that a more accurate title would have been The Man Who Understood Only Numbers.  Certainly he loved children and had no apparent malice towards anyone.  I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in people of unusual intelligence.  This is not a math book.

For one, they persist in the error that the so-called \\"split infinitive\\" is a grammatical error.  A famous modern example of this supposed error is Captain Kirk's \\"to boldly go where no man has gone before.\\"  Supposedly, \\"to go\\" is an infinitive; therefore, it is ungrammatical to insert any words in between.  In fact, \\"to\\" is not part of the infinitive; \\"go\\" IS the infinitive; thus, it is not even possible to split it.  But even if we accept \\"to\\" as part of the infinitive, the fact remains that good writers have been \\"splitting\\" the infinitive for hundreds of years, and it wasn't until the mid-nineteenth century that grammar books started calling it an error.<br />Another problem I have with the authors is their assertion that English is a \\"sexist\\" language, the proof being that masculine pronouns are used to guess the sex of an unknown person.  Whether the language is sexist or not, I ask you: Do you really think there's any reason to tack on a bunch of extra pronouns to the words of Jesus Christ (Matthew 16:26, King James Version) with a politically correct, \\"nonsexist,\\" \\"inclusive\\" line like \\"For what is a man or woman profited, if he or she shall gain the whole world and lose his or her soul? or what shall a man or woman give in exchange for his or her soul?\\"?<br />Can such atrocious language actually constitute any sort of improvement?<br />This book is not bad.  It's actually pretty good--I like the question-and-answer format--although it's hardly the inerrant Word of a Grammar God one would hope for from a Grammar Bible.  As an alternative to this book, I suggest the more readable WOE IS I, by Patricia T. O'Conner. Although it wouldn't be a bad idea to have both books, I don't think it's necessary.	2003-12-29

In fact, even Freud himself thought psychoanalysis would not do schizophrenics any good.<br />This book should be read by anyone interested in a first-person account of what it's like to suffer from schizophrenia.

Books	3	13	18	N	N	A Mixed Review	The author's scientific credentials are impeccable, but his knowledge of Christianity is pretty dismal.  For example, he writes that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.  I'm no Biblical scholar, but I know that, not only is there no Scriptural authority for that claim; there is no evidence whatsoever.  If a \\"creation scientist\\" claimed that the dinosaurs were animals that Noah forgot to put on the Ark, he would be ridiculed as an illiterate Bible pounder.  When a man of learning chooses to write about religion and science, he owes it to his audience to be as careful about his religious data as he is about his scientific data.  The author accepts the Resurrection on faith, although he says that if it turned out that Jesus didn't rise from the dead, he (Stannard) would still be a Christian.  The truth is, if Jesus didn't die and rise again, his whole mission is pointless. <br />I was disappointed, but others might enjoy this book.

Of course, a lot of books move a lot of people to tears, but here the author clearly did not set out to write a tearjerker. <br />This book reminded me of something:  Many years ago, I came close to freezing to death not far from where Nathaniel Lachenmeyer's father died.	2003-12-08

Since it was the only chess book I had at the time, I read it over and over until I inadvertently memorized most of it.  I can't say that it's the best chess book ever written.  There are a few I like better, but this book was the right one for me at the time (1972).<BR>  <BR>I was a terrible player when I first read this book.  Eventually I went on to become a pretty good one.  I don't know how much credit Fischer gets.  He probably would have told me to get a real job, but I loved the game no matter how awful I was.<br />I had the Descriptive Notation version in 1972.

Christianity, the real kind, not the atheism and moral relativism pushed by the author of this book, is growing by leaps and bounds.  Meanwhile, no legitimate Christian wants to go to \\"churches\\" like those presided over by left-wing social activists posing as clergymen, e. g., Bishop Spong.  Pretty soon, if not already, Spong's whole congregation will consist of nothing but Sodomites and Marxists.<br />Christianity doesn't need to change, but Christians need to give a wide berth to the \\"liberation\\" advocated by Spong and his kind. Otherwise, they might find themselves \\"liberated\\" like the Christians in China and Cuba.	2003-12-06

One important similarity between the screen version of John Nash and the man in Sylvia Nasar's biography is that he is a difficult person to like--or sympathize with at all--until it becomes clear that he is losing his mind.  <br />John Nash's story is one of triumph over the horror of madness, and his isn't the only beautiful mind in the story.

He hasn't spoken to her since she wrote this book.  It's all about the sordid love affair between Ayn Rand and Barbara Branden's husband, Nathaniel Branden.  He's no prize himself, but Ayn Rand was one of the most bizarre characters ever to surround herself with a quasi-religious cult.  <br />This book might help steer some youngsters away from \\"Objectivism.\\"  (Ayn Rand is still, perhaps surprisingly, popular among college undergraduates.)

She's not a great fiction writer.  All her heroes are mouthpieces for her philosophy, e. g., they're all atheists who love cigarettes and violent sex; and none of them have any children.  Despite the fact that she was a self-proclaimed \\"right-wing extremist,\\" Rand didn't think much of the traditional family.  And all the bad guys are collectivist straw men--something like Al Franken or Michael Moore without a sense of humor.  And the story's quite hokey, right up to the sci-fi ending.<br />Where she shines is in her ability to tell an interesting story while pushing a dubious, though seductive, philosophy.  Rand--as she expresses herself through her four principal characters--comes across as magnificently arrogant.  It is clear from this book and all Rand's subsequent non-fiction (she wrote no more fiction after Atlas Shrugged) that she was absolutely certain that she possessed the absolute truth about everything she wrote about.	2003-12-05

I'm convinced that, if the world's two best players, say, Kasparov and Kramnik, played a match wherein Black had to play the Latvian in every game, the only question would be whether or not White would win all the games or allow a draw here and there.  <br />Having said that, is it fair to say that it's so bad, it's unplayable?  Well, given a sufficiently weak opponent, almost anything \\"works.\\"  I believe the proper answer to the question of the soundness and playability of the Latvian is: it depends on who is playing.  If both players are reasonably well prepared, and White is well below the Grandmaster level, Black should find that he's dug a pretty formidable hole for himself; but if White is the sort of fellow who just wants to play quietly and develop his pieces in peace, Black should be okay; in fact, it's then when he might be able to seize the initiative.<br />Kosten has definitely improved on his previous book on the Latvian, but unless your definition of a \\"live\\" opening is one that you can spring on your friends at the local chess club, and NOT something Kosten can use to successfully surprise players at his level, I am afraid the burden of proof is still on the author.  Am I wrong?  Well, try playing the Latvian against Fritz or Junior and see how long you last.  Or, could you imagine what would have happened to Kasparov had he played the Latvian against Fritz in their recent match?  (Fritz and Junior are extremely strong computer programs, by the way).	2003-12-03

In rescuing the Bible from fundamentalism, Bishop Spong appears to be trying to rescue the Bible from just about everything that makes it a uniquely Christian book.  Spong doesn't believe any of the Biblical miracles took place, including the Resurrection of Christ.  Of course Spong has nothing against Christians, provided they don't take their Bible literally.  Nor does Spong believe there's anything wrong with homosexuality or just about anything else prohibited by the Bible.  I guess Spong expects his readers to just ignore the parts of the Bible that don't conform to their lifestyles.  I am not surprised that, typical liberal that he is, Spong, in referring to communists three times in his book has no unkind words for them.  At least they're not fundamentalist Christians.  <br />Spong's not a bad writer, but I, for one, have difficulty distinguishing his form of liberal &quot;Christianity&quot; from atheism.  If that's your idea of a religion, you might like this book; personally, I found this book to be a waste of time.	2003-12-03

That's the big, unabridged one.  The handy pocket edition has close to 1,000 pages and costs only $.  It's based on the unabridged original and has the same features I really like about the big one:  Etymology, lots of photos, guidance on grammar, etc.  <br />The only criticism one might have of this book is the choice of who gets to have his picture in the dictionary.  In this particular edition, a male European American is a long shot, unless he happens to have been President of the United States.  For example, Tenzing Norgay, who scaled Mount Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary, gets his picture in the dictionary; Sir Edmund is not so honored.  Muhammad Ali, Jesse Owens, Michael Jordan, and Jackie Robinson make the book, but not Babe Ruth.  Pocahontas makes it, but not Captain John Smith.

Many, if not most, of the greatest players of all time are young and active today.  While I admit that the above statement is debatable, I am far more certain that we are living in the Golden Age of chess writing.  Of course, there's plenty of garbage out there; but if you're looking for good stuff, it's almost as easy to find, thanks in large part to Gambit, the British company that publishes chess books and nothing but chess books.<BR>   There are at least four large one-volume encyclopedic works on the endgame:  Fine's BASIC CHESS ENDINGS, Keres's PRACTICAL CHESS ENDINGS; Wade, Speelman and Tisdall's BATSFORD CHESS ENDINGS; and now this one.  Its three predecessors are excellent works in themselves, but this has a good shot at being generally regarded as the best of them all.  Why?  Well, it's as well written as the others; it's designed to be read cover-to-cover as a series of lessons or as a reference work, and it's all computer-checked for accuracy.  There are sure to be some errors--I hope mostly typographical rather than analytical--but as long as there aren't very many of them, the book should be a great help to anyone wishing to improve his practical results by knowing more about the endgame than his peers.  I haven't read the whole book yet, but so far my opinion is that big books on endings don't get any better than this.	2001-12-26

Unfortunately, these are not his best games; they are just his wins.  And how does Karpov win?  Mostly by exploiting tiny endgame advantages, often in games wherein he passed up advantageous middlegames for dead-even endings.  <BR>  Although his wins are mostly pretty boring, they have considerable instructional value.  Studying the games of Karpov is comparable to eating oatmeal or cream of wheat, whereas the games of Shirov and Kasparov are more comparable to steak or chocolate cake.  The attacking geniuses are more fun, but, for me at least, it's easier to understand and emulate the styles of Karpov and Capablanca than that of Tal or Alekhine.  Playing solid, positional chess doesn't win a lot of brilliancy prizes, but most people who sacrifice pieces and try to calculate eight moves deep just wind up looking like fools most of the time.<BR>  I give author Mednis a mixed review.  He knows what's going on in the games better than most of his readers, but as Grandmasters go, he's not much of a tactician.  Besides missing a lot of tactics, he has an annoying habit of calling a move \\"the losing move\\" that is anything but that.  For example, in a game between Karpov and Spassky that went 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6, Mednis calls Black's second move the losing move simply because the King's Indian isn't part of Spassky's normal repertoire.  But half the fun of this book is finding baloney like that, so despite what I just said, I strongly recommend the book anyway.	2001-11-15

I'm sure the gambits recommended in this book would be sufficient to destroy any Black Defense played by a sufficiently weak player, but who needs this book--or any book for that matter--to beat such a player?  Even assuming this book is intended for average players looking to steal a few points from their own kind, the question still remains:  Are these gambits good enough for even that modest task?  For the most part, they are not.  Even author Schiller admits that he doesn't have anything that meets his &quot;standards&quot; to recommend against the Scandinavian.  He says that if you really must play a gambit after 1.e4 d5 (why else would we buy such a book, if not to learn something about some sort of gambit against a move that is played very often at the sub-Master level?), go ahead and try your luck with the Tennison Gambit, which continues 2. Nf3?! fxe4 3. Ng5.  What I find peculiar is that, rather than offer this dubious gambit, why not recommend transposing to the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit with 2. d4?  It's not very good either, but at least it isn't the sort of thing your typical Class C player can refute over the board.  The author managed to get his books published and widely distributed by Cardoza Publications, better known for their books on gambling.  I don't know if all of Schiller books are as terrible as this one, as I am not masochistic enough to read all of them; however, I have taken the time to examine most of his Cardoza books, and none of them are any better than this one. The book's jacket proclaims its author THE WORLD'S LEADING AUTHORITY ON OPENINGS.  I would wager that,if he is an authority on anything, it is self-promotion.  With all the bad grammar, misspellings and typos in this dreadful book, one gets the impression that his books are written at a blitz pace and not proofread at all.  I suppose the author figures that, as long as people are dumb enough to buy such trash, he hasno reason to try to write something good. I suggest that, if you intend to purchase any books from this publisher, stick to the ones on gambling.  This book is no gamble; if you buy it, you are a sure loser.  And--since you ask--no, I didn't buy it.  I read most of it while hanging out at the bookstore's coffee shop.	2001-04-16

Most of them are pretty sound, but the funniest is the Bulgarian Defense to the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a5! ), which makes it look as if Black intended  ...a6, but accidentally pushed the pawn two squares.   Also amusing is  Bucker's idea in the Sicilian: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 h6.  The idea is that if White  plays the normal 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5, Black gets a  Sveshnikov/Pelikan set-up without allowing White to play Bg5.  There are a  lot of interesting and unusual ideas in this book.  The author is very  careful with his analysis and rarely makes a serious analytical error in  any of his books.	2000-07-28

The biography is a good read, but the games  alone are worth the price of the book.  They are in descriptive notation.   I know a lot of players don't like descriptive notation, but there is a  mountain of low-priced classic chess literature in descriptive notation, of  which this book is just one of the many outstanding examples.  Take my  advice: Learn descriptive and read the classics.  You won't regret the  experience.	2000-07-25

Seeing that it was back in print, I bought a copy last month and had just as much fun with it as I did the first time I read it.  This time I went through all the games with a strong  computer program.  There are 100 games in this book, and there are around  300 major analytical errors, but they don't detract from the enjoyment of  the games, nor from the overall high quality of the writing.	2000-05-22

At this price, it is an absolute steal!  There is simply no way for me to convey what a brilliantly written book this is.  You just have to see for  yourself.	1999-08-30

In my case, I found the book to be a slightly amusing exercise in  debunking crackpot  science (which is why I gave it two stars).      I'm  sure that there will be several others who will agree with me that this may  just be the most preposterous chess book ever written. If, however, you're  the sort of person who watches PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE every time it's on  TV, calls the Psychic Friends Network regularly and thinks professional  wrestling is for real, this book is right up your alley.	1999-07-11

About the only complaint anyone might have about Watson is that his work is so thorough and excellent, he doesn't seem to have time to write a lot of  books.  A pity, since there aren't more than a dozen writers who can claim  to equal the quality of his work.	1999-05-31
