I have read about 6 of these books and I go out of order because I can't always find the ones I'm looking for. I read \\"Including Alice\\" before this and thought it wasn't that great; this one was much better. There is comedy, irony, heart break and some happy moments too. Alice and her friends are very much like a lot of teens that I have come in contact with.  <br /> <br />I was pretty sad about her break up with Patrick although I knew they were broken up already. I really think they are each other's first loves but I doubt they will end up together in the end. Most teen romances just don't work out.	2005-05-19

I checked this one out from the library and I am glad I didn't pay for it because I am pretty sure I wouldn't like to have something like this in my collection.  <br /> <br />The Positives: Alice is a real girl; she cops a 'tude; she cries at the drop of a hat; her best friends mean the world to her ... It was sweet the way she bonded (finally) with her stepmother, Sylvia.  <br /> <br />The Negatives: OMG was this is trashy! I have read Harlequins (as much as I hate to admit it) and this still made me blush! Alice and her friends are sex-obsessed. I remember being very curious in high school so I understand its realistic but c'mon -should young, impressionable girls really be reading this? I was totally shocked and no body can call me a prude. ~ And the book is lacking the usual humor that I had become accoustmed to in Naylor's novels. Not too many laughs to be had. The \\"comedy\\" was pretty tame.  <br /> <br />Overall, this book is interesting. But would I recommend it for girls under the age of 15? Heck no!	2005-05-14

It had an interesting premise and moved at a good pace but it just felt a little lackluster for some reason. (I definitely can relate to Izzie though.) In the end, there was too much preaching and philosphizing. Authors need to learn that sending a message about drugs, alcohol and sex to teenagers is best done sublty. Over all the book was pretty good.	2005-05-13

I have read them out of order so far so I just got to this novel - the very first one in the series - MATES, DATES AND INFLATABLE BRAS. It was really funny and sweet. The series is based on the friendship of four girls - Lucy, Nesta, Izzie and TJ. In INFLATABLE BRAS, Lucy is the charatcer the novel is based on. She tells the story in first person narrative.  <br /> <br />Very easy read. Very charming and very realistic for teens. Yes it is a glamorized version of teenage life but it does have roots in reality. All girls feel inaquate, despise their looks at some time, worry about boys (all the time) and deal with weird family dynamics. That's why these books will be interesting to teenage girls and to older \\"girls\\" like me (I'm 22).  <br /> <br />Lucy is somewhat pessimistic but what teen isn't at some point? So far my favorite Mates, Dates girl is Izzie. I can't wait to read her story in Mates, Dates and Cosmic KIsses.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2005-05-13

Sure it a glamorized version of teenage girlhood but some of the same problems the characters had happen to real girls. Dating, breakups, parents dying ... a lot of girls can relate to that. This book is not supposed to be Anna Karenina but it is for pure entertainment value and I think the writer more than succeeds in entertaining the reader. At least I was entertained. I laughed a lot and felt sad sometimes but it was an adventure. I am 22 now and I love this book so I can imagine that any teenage girl would. Highly recommended!  <br /> <br />P.S. I actually enjoyed this more than the 2 Mates, Dates books I've read.	2005-05-12

Overall this book was terrific. Well conceived, well written. I liked how it got back to the basics with Willow, Buffy, Giles and Xander. I also like Anya and Dawn. I really hoped that The Buffster would have had time to get to know the supernatural being Michael. He seemed wonderful. I will always want her with Angel though.  <br /> <br />As the title says, SPIKE SUCKS! I didn't watch the last three seasons of Buffy so I don't know if he was like this on the show but in the book he acted like Buffy's lovesick puppy dog, following her everywhere and begging to be loved. It was pathetic. Spike was best as a bad guy. The minute they put that damn chip in his brain, it seems like the character became truly pathetic.  <br /> <br />If you don't mind a wimpy Spike then buy this book. Its good.	2005-05-10

The sisters are too watered down. They don't have their spunk or passion. They seem to nice and agreeable. Where is their spunk? <br /> <br />The main problem I had with the book was the story itself. It was so ridiculous. I have watched other witch shows and read other witch books and this one is just too hard to swallow. The actual writing was poor. A high schooler could have written it. If you don't follow the show (I don't anymore) then you may find some of the details and terminology hard to understand. What exactly does \\"orbed out\\" mean? <br /> <br />I am glad I got this from the library and didn't waste the money.

I have read about five other Patterson books and they were not very impressive. However, THE BEACH HOUSE was fast-paced and entertaining. I really liked the main character and most of the characters were interesting. <br />This is the ultimate BEACH book.	2003-04-29

It was written in the early eighties before Bridget Jones became a household name. It is a thoughtful novel about the breakup of a marriage. It is a quick read, but its not an earth-shattering premise. I recommend it for the beach or the bathtub.	2003-04-29

It is about a girl named \\"Annie\\" who gets in a relationship with an abusive guy named Danny and then becomes pregnant by him. I thought that \\"Annie\\" was too naive and stupid at times. I wouldn't have stayed with Danny for anything. I believe she suffered from very low self-esteem. <br />Overall, its a must read for teenagers and women alike.	2003-04-29

It was sloppy. Alex Cross is still a great character though; that never changes.	2003-04-29
US	38726404	R3BMXCY4VAOLRR	0312252250	7984183	The Perfect Elizabeth: A Tale of Two Sisters	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A contemporary fiction novel	This is a book about two sisters named Liza and Bette. They are both quirky and interesting. I prefer Bette, probably because Liza reminds me too much of myself - very nuerotic and pessimistic; she over anyalzes everything. <br />The books highlights are the relationship between the sisters, any passages about the parents, and Bette's pregnancy. At times it could be boring.	2003-04-08

It is a tragic story. Her husband was a monster who put her through so much before she finally pulled the trigger one night and killed him. The story is about a woman's struggle to survive and thrive in a chaotic, cruel world. Recommended, but beware it can be graphic!	2003-04-08

It got such great reviews from critics and readers alike that I thought for sure I had stumbled on a winner. To bad for me that the book was slow and that the ending just reeked. I also never felt as if the main character were in any real danger from Valentine.	2003-04-04

It was based on the miniseries \\"Rose Red\\" by Stephen King. It told the story of Ellen Rimbauer and her husband. <br />Why it was entertaining: It appeared to be historically accurate in its descriptions of the early last century. It was fast-paced it was just plain good writing.<br />Why it was disturbing: Mr. Rimbauer was not the least bit faithful to his wife, and after a time Ellen herself got involved sexually with her best friend and confidant. There's was a dysfunctional union where Ellen would invoke the dark side against her husband. Also, the bedroom descriptions were a little much for the brain!	2003-03-24

This book is not just for preteens, it is for everyone! It is written intelligently and is so funny. Catherine is not you average damsel in distress. She is a thinker and a doer and she doesn't rely on anyone for anything. I loved the ways in which she would scare away suitors! This is a must-read for everybody.	2003-03-21

She was selfish and acted all holier-than-thou. But her worst offense was putting a boy before her so-called bestfriend, which is a no-no as everybody should know. <br />I won't be reading any more books by Anna Myers.	2003-03-21

I really felt her love for them. My favorite of the children was the autistic Boo.<br />Read this book - you won't regret it.	2003-03-21
US	38726404	RCQ0ASBYS18EE	0618056785	264726995	Imani All Mine	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A  great novel!	Tasha Dawson (the main character) is the voice of a generation ... of teenage mothers living in the ghetto. Everything she says is honest and  realistic. Rather than being stereotypical, Tasha is written with a lot of dimensions and is anything but a cardboard cutout. I liked most of the characters in this book and all the situations were believeable and heartrening. <br />This book left me in tears. Surpisingly, this was also a pageturner. I couldn't put it down.	2003-03-14

The abuse that Gabriella suffered was realistically written and so was the way Steel described the scars that it left on her character. I liked most of the characters and the book was fast paced. However, I find a sexual relationship between a priest and an almost-nun disgusting. I didn't like the priest and found him to a weakling. I also didn't like that through out the book Gabriella was constantly leaning on a man to give meaning to her life. It would have been nice to see her be more independent. All in all I say this book is worth reading.	2003-03-14

But in a lot of ways it failed to deliver. <br />It turned predictable about half way thru. And what started out as a fascinating relationship beteween Max and Olivia (the lead characters) eventually turned into a romance that you could find in any Harlequinn novel. How totally boring! <br />I would recommend this book to someone looking for some light reading who doesn't mind a predictable ending.	2003-03-11

She had spirit and guts.	2003-03-10

It was slow-paced and dragged on at parts. I never felt that the characters were actually in any danger. This was a romance novel in disguise. The characters and their love scenes were straight out of a cheesy Harlequinn romance novel. <br />The identity of Heartbreaker was a surprise though and the book was just interesting enough that I didn't throw it down in frustration. However, I would NOT read another novel by Julie Garwood.	2003-02-18

It was an original idea for a book. There were plenty of twists and turns. <br />Cons: A slow start and a weak ending. The murder's identity turned out to be a surprise, but I thought that he/she was a poor choice to be the killer.	2003-02-05

The story failed to really catch my interest and pull me in. It was your run-of-the-mill kidnapping story. The only thing that surprised me was the identity of the kidnapper/murderer.	2003-01-27

I can't exactly pinpoint why, though.<br />Maybe it was that it focused on multiple children rather than just one or maybe it was that it was focused so much on Ladbrooke, a mother of one of Torey's students. Yes that was probably the reason. We read more about Ladbrooke than we did about the children and their problems and that was very dull.	2003-01-20

This book I was hoping would equal ALONG CAME A SPIDER in quality, but it failed miserably.<br />It was boring; it was uneven and just plain ridiculous.

It was very suspenseful and for once I couldn't guess who dun it! It kept you wanting to turn the pages. My only greivance: that it didn't explain why the killer kept writing &quot;black for remeberance&quot; on all the boquets. (You'll know what I mean once you read the book.) Highly recommened.	2003-01-13

Perhaps I've outgrown Mary Higgins Clark - who knows. The book plot was certainly original but the book moved much too slowly. <br />Instead of her usual batttery of suspects, there were only 3 suspects and only 2 of them were suscpicious which meant that the least suspicious character did the murders, naturally. <br />Next time, I won't buy her books brand new - I'll wait and get them for trade in a used book store so if they disappoint me I won't be losing money.	2003-01-11

It was suspenseful thru and thru (although a little slow at times). The story was like a spider's web in that it brought together all these little pieces to make a great big picture. <br />My favorite character was little Dulcie, the daughter of the deceased Kristin. She was a great character full of life, vitality, and wisdom. <br />I also loved that the author didn't force Julia and Paine's mutual attraction down our throat. The book was surprisingly free of the usual romantic cliches (they really annoy me!) that you find in other suspense books. <br />I am sure that anyone who reads it will enjoy it!	2002-06-11

However, I am in no hurry to read it after being dismally disappointed with 1st to Die. <br />The women were annoying with the exception of Claire, who fortunately wasn't the stereotypical loud, crass black woman that is so popular in the media these days. As a woman and a feminist to boot, I do not like to see female characters painted in such broad strokes.<br />Now to the mystery ... it was sophmoric and something I would expect from a green writer, not one as polished and talented as Patterson. I find it incredibly hard to believe that the mystery was completely solved in 4 weeks time, when realistically, it would have taken months or years for the cops to finger the right criminal. I found the motive of the killer to be unconvincing and unclear, at best. That was just the first of many of my complaints about this book. <br />I say next time, Patterson should stick w/ Alex Cross!!	2002-03-08

This was not a suspense novel as it was advertised, but a romance in disguise. If I wasn't so darn stubborn, I wouldn't have even bothered to finish it. The characters were all one-dimensional, all whiny and full of themselves. Elizabeth was your average romance novel &quot;heroine&quot; - drop dead gorgeous - a woman who all the men want and all the women hate. Blah blah blah ... Dane, Elizabeth's paramour, was no better. (He made up half of the most incomptent police force in any book I've ever read. They were all too busy screwing around to get any real work done.) Handsome and bitter, he had been scorned by his first love and didn't want to love anyone ... yawn yawn yawn. This scenario is so old and cliched its positively embarrassing. They fell in love and into bed in like, 2 days. No kidding! The actual &quot;suspense&quot; (if you could call it that) was slow and also riddled with cliches. I guessed the murderer soon into the book and the motives for killing the tourist were obscure at best. Save your money!	2002-01-21
US	38726404	R29TODGEL9H53F	0449005909	38926947	Nightshade	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Trite and predictable	I decided to read this book after I read Saul's Blackstone Chronicles. I enjoyed the build up in that book, but the ending fell flat. So I got this one thinking I would give him another try. But I was none too impressed with this one, either. It was slow building and not much happened in the first 100 pages. I guessed the identity of the &quot;evil person&quot; early on, and guessed about Matt's connnection to Cynthia also. The ending wrapped up too neatly and left you with an unsatisfied feeling. I am going to give him one more chance to impress me ... I hope UNLOVED is good.	2001-12-31

She was brillant, beautiful, blah blah blah and she knew it. I found her to be very self-important and full of herself. I didn't like her or sympathize with her a bit, which is sad because I usually love strong female characters. Then Mr. Green had almost every other character be stupid and ugly so that she would look that much better. You knew right off that she would live to be the victorious heroine. I found Lipton's motives for murder very simplistic and unrealistic - &quot;Oh no!; I'm impotent and everybody is laughing at me about it!&quot; And then there was the whole Walt Tanner thing. I found it hard to believe that Lipton was just storing his body waiting for the right time to dump it and let everyone believe it was his. No build up on that. <br />The good: Fast-paced, with a few interesting characters like Sales and Bolinger.	2001-12-31
