Her desciption of everything from everyday life, the quilting bees, the sugaring and the Underground Railroad ring true to the times. <br /> <br />The book holds the reader's fascination with its mysteries and the complex family and neighborhood relationships. Each night brings the uncertainy of visits from either escaped slaves or worse still, the slavecathchers. <br /> <br />In the beginning one never quite know whose side any of the Elm Creek population is on.  Especially Uncle Jacob. He is the mysterious catalyst that changes the tone of the story from life with his constant rebukes to his relatives to the unraveling of the reasons he spent so much time in the sugar camp. <br /> <br />Dorothea is the perfect central character. We see her world through her eyes and a confusing place it can be. Cyrus with his boasting and Thomas Nelson with his quiet fortitude.  One pretending the court her only for the information to be obtained, the other admiring from afar until certain circumstances bring them closer to a promising future. <br /> <br />I could not wait until I have some free moments everyday to reading this book. Now that I am finished, I look forward to Jennifer's next book which is due out in the winter. <br /> <br />Her imagnination and attention to detail make all of her books a joyful adventure in reading and a constant inspiration to my quilting.	2005-06-14

The story is sweet, but lacks spark.  It is a book that I could put down and not pick up for weeks.  There was nothing compelling in it that made me want keep reading. <br /> <br />Perhaps I am being a bit harsh, but probably my reaction to the book is because I am older. It is a nice story aimed at the 30 something and younger crowd who have not yet taken on the mantle of responsibility.	2005-06-14

What if Peter had survived?  And in this book he has and is very, very real. With a multi dimensional personality, Peter is at one and the same time, waiting for the Green Police, joking with his daughters at dinner and appreciating his attractive wife. Yet realistically, he can't be in all of those places. He has to let go of something. <br /> <br />He manages to put his past fairly well behind him until his wife becomes involved in the story of Anne's diary. Then more than ever he is haunted day and night, with every word and gesture by those days in the Secret Annexe. <br /> <br />Only when he reclaims his faith and reveals his identity to his wife, can he rein in his emotions and bring some control to the runaway wanderings of his mind.  Only then can he firmly put both feet on the path he has chosen as an American of Jewish descent. <br /> <br />It is a fascinating and fast read. Inspiring and inspirational. It reawakened my interest in Anne Frank and the story of her family.	2005-05-21

They also are west suburban phobic.  All the stores, bakeries etc. that are directly west of the city are listed under south suburban.  By omitting a west suburban chapter, this book is less appealing to people who live in that area.    Last time I looked, Evanston was in Cook county. The editors place it sometimes in Lake County, sometimes in Cook.    I recently discovered that while the information gatherers are from Chicago, the book was mapped into locations in LA. Hence the inaccuracies.  It is an excuse, but one from which many lessons should be learned.  Don't always count on those computer maps.  It is not like looking at the atlas yourself.    Hopefully, in a later edition these errors will be corrected.	2005-04-15

We get a feel for the times with women doing war work, rationing and young boys from the town that are killed.   <br /> <br />And one great thing about this book is that a young girl is given her break into journalism by a crusty old editor. A concept that in those times was remarkable indeed.	2005-01-13

I bought this book hoping to learn more about the queen's life as she lives it away from the public.  Instead I found a poorly written book filled with many untruths. After page 121 I sent the book to the resale shop. <br /> <br />Some of these huge errors are as follows. <br />1. That the Home Secretary has been present at every royal birth since the time of James II. Not true. George VI overuled this for the birth of Prince Charles. <br /> <br />2. That the Elizabeth and Phillip spent time at the home of the Duke and Dutchess of Kent in 1946, where the Duke and Dutchess understood their need to be alone. Yes, they did, but the Duke was no longer living. The then duke was a young boy. <br /> <br />3. That Elizabeth and Phillip's wedding night was Nov. 22. Their wedding date is Nov. 20. Huge error. <br /> <br />4.That Prince Charles was born on Nov. 12. He was born on Nov. 14. People from the UK writing such a book should know their dates. <br /> <br />5.That she had never ridden on the underground, made a bed or prepared tea or a meal. Again not true. She rode on the London tube in 1939 to have tea at the YMCA and during her time in Girl Guides did in fact make her bed, wash dishes and prepare meals with the other guides. <br /> <br />So save your money and buy a book about the queen that has been thoroughly researched and has all the facts straight.	2004-10-27

Knowing a little bit about wartime England and having visited some small villages, this story rings so true. Ms Mayhew has all the village locals just right. The aloof matron of the manor, the crusty farmer who shares with no one, the parents who hide their emotions while silently grieving inside for lost or missing children. She has described them all perfectly.<br />You will find your favorite characters as I did. I loved the relationship with the young corporal and the maiden lady. Young Tom  was a resourceful young man, who was learning at a young age how to be an entrepeneur. He was clearly the darling of the airbase.<br />Ms Mayhew leads us through the lives of some of the most endearing characters I have ever met in a book. Clearly, this is a book which shows an example of why that time was &quot;Britain's finest hour.&quot;<br />The reader will find everything in this book. Romance, adventure, sadness, suspense, as well as the ravages of war and the hardships of rationing.<br />My only complaint, was that the book ended way too soon.	2004-01-21

Especially entertaining were her descriptions of the Gridiron dinners where she was often portraying first ladies in skits.<br />This was a fast read, fun and entertaining. However, it came as no surprise that Nixon had a dark humor, Reagan was always full of hot air and President Jr. and Sr. need to work on their command of the English language.  What was great about the book was that it allowed us in to see a very human side of the working White House.  I felt a part of the briefings and press conferences.<br />After reading the book, I could honestly say that I knew more about the personalities of each president. Just by the tidbits in this book, it seems as though Jimmy Carter and Gerry Ford were the most genuine. Bill Clinton was certainly the most entertaining and sadly, our current president, does not always make the best impression.<br />Lighthearted and jovial, Helen entertains us for all 240 pages.	2003-07-30

The story winds around Elm Creek Manor, then and now. The story is as gentle and intricate as the fins quilting stitches used by Eleanor Bergstrom herself.<br />Never predictable, always suspenseful as to what we will find at each stop along the way, this book is for anyone who has an interest in family, legacies or quilts.<br />By now we know all the Elm Creek regulars, Summer, Sarah, Matthew and Andrew.  The author sweetly addresses the marriage of Sylvia and Andrew as she wakes up in the arms of her new husband, showing that love is for all, not just the young.<br />The description of the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918 was spot on and timely in view of the times we are living in. Of course, that particluar flu won't hit us again, but it is a strong reminder of the transitory lives we all lead.<br />I only wish that we saw more resolution in the situation with Andrew and his children. But perhaps that story is yet to tell.  My only fault was that Jennifer has the date wrong for the sailing of Titanic. She sailed from Southampton on April 10th, 1912, not the 12th.<br />With rich descrptions, and warm characters playing against a cross section of America, I can only compare this book to the experience of snuggling under a cozy quilt while eating warm cookies with ice cold milk.  Pure bliss.	2003-05-28

Not only don't waste your time, but don't waste your money.  Anything that you need to know about the four agreements can be read on the inside flap of the front cover. That about covers it and the rest of the book just embellishes in a mundane, repetitive and simplistic manner, the same theme.<br />Go to the bookstore, read the cover and move on. The rest is not worth the effort. I struggled through half the book and found the reading cumbersome.	2003-05-04

I was hooked after the first page. Dani and Jack are a match made in heaven.  The story unfolds as the secrets of the past hold them hostage to the love they once knew. But with Dani and Jack, these do not divide them, only draw them closer and the end makes their relationship stronger.    They are both great characters with a warmth and understanding that cracks open even the cold heart of Dani's father.    I can't wait to move onto the next Callahan brother's story.    I only had two questions after I finished the book. Did Dani ever take Matt to get the promised dog and what was Matt's reaction to the long lost Holly. Perhaps we might get a glimpse of this in the next book.    It has been a long time since I devoured a story as quickly as this one.	2003-04-21

On page 87, Nicholas tells Dougless that he was writing a letter to his mother, just as he was leaving to come forward in time.  On page 99 Dougless wonders if he can read and write.<br />I did not find it a particularly satislfying book and just crept through it page by page hoping that along the way it would improve and that the tempo of the story would quicken.  For sure it was not a book that I could not put down. I had to consciously think about going back to read it.<br />Perhaps it is because I am not a real fan of time travel books that I did not find it to be a &quot;thrillingly romantic tale.&quot;	2003-03-12

While I have lived through most of the history, much of what he said was new to me. I found the history of White House politics and the press very enlightening.  And his stint as a reporter in Viet Nam, gave me a clearer picture of just what the young men of my generation had to deal with.<br />Bob Schieffer demonstrates in the book that reporters are just as vulnerable to the foibles of life as we are.  While his career was most prominent in his life, the needs of his family, in the end won out.<br />He takes us into the broadcast booth with him where we find people who worked for four days in 9/11, producers who sat under his desk feeding him page after page of the Starr report and where on election night 2000, the networks themselves set the stage for the most bizarre night ever on TV.<br />We are with him in Dallas, Viet Nam and on the courthouse steps of a sleepy 1960 Fort Worth.  Throughout the entire book Schieffer, in his modest, warm and humorous way takes us on a forty year journey through an America that has reinvented itself over and over, only to come full circle on a viewing platform at Ground Zero.	2003-03-05

In one paragraph, we read about the affection between Jackie and Miss Shaw, and in the next, we read that Miss Shaw has been fired with no explanation as to why.<br />One of the biggest research errors occurs on page 167.  The book refers to the fact that Jackie was a friend of FDR's daughter Kate.  His daughter's name was Anna. He had a granddaughter named Kate who was born in 1936, making them seven years apart.  Jackie lived in NYC until she was 13, which would have been in 1942. At that time, Kate, the granddaughter would have been only six. I am not convinced that they would have been friends with that age difference. Not likely between a 13 year old and a 6 year old.<br />Page 189 again lists the royal duchesses with the lower case d, instead of Duchess. But more than that calls Marina, the Duchess of Kent, as someone who fit into the archtypical mode of her time. That is far from the truth with Marina. Once when being criticized by her mother in law, Queen Mary, Marina told her, &quot;your George may not like it, but my George does.&quot; Hardly something that a stereotyped duchess would have said to her queen.<br />There are several more instances in the book where the titles of Duke are listed in the lower case. It looks like a spellchecker was used more than the human eye.<br />I feel that the shame of this promising book is that the editing and research were careless, hardly a fitting tribute to the meticulous editing of Jackie.<br />This is not one book that will remain in my collection.	2002-12-23

And while it reveals really nothing new, I am appalled at the errors in research. Someone didn't do their homework.  I plan to finish reading it only to see how many more mistakes I can find.<br />On page 88, there is no capitalization for the titles Duke of Windsor and Duke of York. Calling them instead the duke of York and the duke of Windsor.<br />Page 101 talks about the Royal train incident. It has been told in other biographies that there was no incident. There was no one on the train.<br />Page 129 states that MAJESTY magazine was launched in 1981 to cover stories on Diana. I did a bit of research today on that and received an email saying that the magazine started in 1980, six months before Diana appeared on the scene. They had their 20th anniversary issue in 2000.<br />On page 129, the author writes of the royal women who garnered various types of attention. Loved the Queen Mum and Princess Marina, the Duchess of Kent. Since the author seems to be speaking of the present time, Marina is dead. The current Duchess of Kent is Kathryn.<br />There is alot of skipping around and in some instances, it is assumed that the reader should already know certain information.<br />The general idea of the book is clever, but personally I have gotten much more enjoyment from reading separate books on these two fascinating women.	2002-12-17

In fact, I took her copy home to read. From the first meeting of all the characters, I loved these women and could commiserate with their lives.  Graham perfectly describes life in the Uk right after the war. It was still pretty dull and dreary. Country people were just like Kath.<br />Peggy, the protagonist, is the glue that holds the book and the characters together. Through life and death, famine and fortune, as well as the normal ups and downs of daily life, we are given a good dose of tolerance as well as hope.<br />Peggy waits it out for a better relationship with her daughter. She is ahead of her time by befriending and choosing Grice as her co-worker. She is patient with the bizarre behavior of her other friends.<br />I did find it rather sad that so many of the men in the book were losers. However, by being such, these women were given more of a chance to develope themselves into more interesting people.<br />The fifties were a time of change. Women had so much freedom during the war years and now their men came back and could not tolerate having wives as smart if not smarter than them.  The military wives even more so had to play the game.<br />Graham does a wonderful job of describing in detail the appearances, clothing, and decor of every character and setting.<br />The saddest thing is the condition that was passed on from John Pharoah's liaison with Lois. With little information in those times, an unsupervised John was an accident waiting to happen. It shows though that with the changing times, Kath brought the issue to the forefront, thus sparing another generation agony. Although, Kirk's son tested free of the dreaded Huntington's disease.<br />I want to read more of Laurie Graham's book now. They are wonderful, relaxing and hard to put down. Just one tiny error. She has President and Mrs. Reagan attending Diana's wedding, when in fact it was Mrs. Reagan alone.	2002-12-17

The characters never really developed. I got the feeling that the writing of this book was rather hurried.<br />Lee and Hunter were a mismatched couple and I don't think in the long run they could have made things work. I believe that deep inside each one, the flames of their old lives still burned.  Lee transformed herself from a glitzy business woman to earth mom so quickly that I don't think that she knew what hit her.<br />Personally, I didn't care for Hunter. There was the potential for a dark and cynical side to him that in anger would have reared up. And his ten year old daughter was too sophisticated for her age to be real.<br />There was the smoking issue with both male characters which is something that we are not looking for in role models these days. When Lee told Hunter that he smoked too much, he did not offer to stop.<br />The story of Bryan and Shade moved so slowly. This was certainly not a book that I couldn't stop reading. The second story was something that I almost had to force myself to finish.  <br />These two characters were both somewhat hardened and jaded in their attitudes of life.  There is not really enought background on either of them to fully grasp the issues that they have. All of that was rather glossed over.<br />It was just so, so and was for sure not magical as some of Nora Robert's other books have been.	2002-09-14

Not being either Catholic or Christian, I still found this little novel a fast read that got my curiosity going regarding the selection process for saints and biblical history.<br />One needn't be religious to enjoy the details of the friendship that developed between these two women.  I felt a part of their relationship thanks to the rich details that laviously fill the book.<br />With every little thing noted from the contents of the guest room drawer to description of the various embalmed hearts in shrines across Europe, the author does not miss much.<br />It was a fast and pleasant read and gave food for thought about finding yourself and making friends.  You don't have to be religious to appreciate the tidbits of history thrown in for good measure.<br />I enjoyed the book and it held my interest all the way through.	2002-09-05

One of the things I enjoyed was the fact that some of the story centered around Iowa City, Iowa and the university there. A place where we spent six wonderful years visiting our kids. But that aside, I could easily identify in some way with many of the characters. Every family has the dysfunctional Joyce, the overachieving Holly, the trying to prove herself Amy etc.<br />On those long summer nights in Minnesota, the reader could become a part of the Legend famiy. From getting the feel of sleeping there during a summer storm, sitting around the campfire, and the simple decor of the cabins, we in some way long to be a part of that simple no frills kind of vacation.<br />Jack and Amy, our two lovers, connected instantly, but for the sake of the family, put their emotions on hold.  Their relationship is sweet and brief, but on that, they build a strong and sure love.  While a fair amount of time is spent dealing with the problems of the other characters, the attraction of Jack and Amy is the main thrust of the book. I only wish that we had been let to experience more than their one brief, intimate encounter at the lake.  Still though, maybe that innocence is what makes the book so special. In that one aspect, much is left to our recommendation.<br />I would for sure keep this book to read again, as well and look for other Seidel titles.	2002-07-16

Mr. Lacey's research is meticulous and his sources are close enough to the monarch that we knew these people witnessed the events first hand.<br />The book does a very good job of describing the situation that developed at the time of the death of Diana.  It was interesting to find out that the queen herself approved of all of the plans for the funeral, many in fact were her idea.  While not diminishing the role of Prince Charles in the arrangements, the queen and her staff were largely responsible for that memorable day.<br />It was also interesting to find out that Diana's sons had distanced themselves from her that summer because of her romance with Dodi. And also that her brother in law Sir Robert Fellowes was not the villian he has often portrayed to be in other books, where his feelings for Diana were concerned.<br />The history leading up to the accession of QEII is always fascinating and is well handled here in the book. The scenarios surrounding the plans for the coronation and her wedding give a real inside look at the royal family.<br />After reading this book, I was a little disappointed in some members of the family and staff, liked other even more and found a great respect for the woman herself. While she can be stubborn and dig in when the chips fall against her, she can also quickly see the light and move with the tide.  Most particularly in the flag flap at the time of Diana's death.<br />I give high marks to this book.  There is so much interesting history in the book that is can be read again and again and still hold the reader's interest.<br />On a more picky note, I found several mistakes in the book.  On page xi of the Royal Who's Who, Edward the VII is listed as being made Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle in 1911.  That would be Edward the VIII, since Edward the VII was already dead in 1911.  On page 36, we have a coach careering around an area instead of careening.  Lastly on page 151, they have Prince Phillip at 26 in 1946 and on the next page, age 24 in the same year.<br />Nevertheless, this book should entertain and inform all people who follow the lives of the royal family. There is a nice mix of political fact and the freshness of looking at last behind the palace walls.  This book stays in my collection as a wonderful testament to the woman we are all  more than a little curious about. Whether she is wrong or right about certain things, she cetainly has staying power.	2002-07-07

During those more innocent times of the 60's, I don't really think that they totally understood the ramifications of being shot up with drugs so regularly.  That side of their personality aside, I found this book quite fascinating as to how they could have such a messed up marriage and still carry off a stunning political reign.<br />They were a team, bizarre as Jack Kennedy's sexual behavior was, these two were a highly energized dynamic duo, each feeding off the success of the other. Jack loved nothing more than to show off his brilliant wife and Jackie thrived in the spotlight whenever she had demonstrated one of her amazing coups of winning the hearts of many recalcitrant world leaders. They were magical, both of them.  <br />However, away from the glitter of White House social life, Jack continued his depraved sexual life, leaving a dismayed Jackie to turn the other way, always wondering what she lacked.<br />She did not like the White House and spent more weeks away from it than we knew before.  It was she that loved the Virginia hunt life and the house they built there together.  For her it was an escape from having to come face to face with a long line of young girls brought in to perform sexual favors with the President.<br />But in the end, behind it all, after the death of Patrick and in the months leading up to the assasination, there was a change. A deep and loving devotion grew between the two of them. An abiding respect developed and Jack Kennedy for the first time realized what he has been doing to his wife.  Had he lived, I think that he would have changed. He was already on the brink. Jackie, though had to live with the uncertainly. Never knowing what would have been ahead for them.  <br />This book gives some great behind the scenes information about what life was like during the missle crisis, just what happened in the ER in Dallas, and describes in detail the terrible sadness that the president felt when Patrick died.<br />We are shown two diverse personalities who in their own odd way, teamed up and lit up the world for three short years.  We see two devoted parents as well.<br />In short, the end of the book says it best.  That after the assasination, Jackie's resolve was to show that world how she would bring out the best in her children. To make them everything that their father would have wanted.  This became her mission.  While not mentioned in this book, one of her famous quotes is \\"If you bungle bringing up your children, nothing else that you do much matters.\\"  A mantra that many people today would well follow.	2002-06-18

The American spirit is still alive and well as demonstrated by the outpouring of love, support and donations that followed in the aftermath of September 11th.  We have always been there for each other in times of need and I suspect we always will. However, for the people of North Platte Nebraska, that spirit was a little more determined than most. They truly performed a miracle.<br />I first found out about the North Platte Canteen while reading a history of the Union Pacific RR passenger service. It intrigued me enough so that on our next car trip west, I insisted that we stop in North Platte and find the old station that had served as the canteen.<br />Like Bob Greene, I was deeply troubled when I found that there was nothing left to show for it but a few red paving bricks along side of the tracks.  After questioning a few people, I discovered that a small mock up of the canteen could be seen at the Lincoln Country Historical Society Museum on the west side of town. Not only can you see pictures and read stories about the canteen, but you might be lucky enough to find someone to talk to who had personal experiences with the canteen.<br />The morning we visited, I spoke with a woman whose mother had been active in the canteen. She shared with me one of the methods by which they knew a troup train was coming through. Out in the countryside, the engineer of the train would display a colored ribbon flying from the cab.  The person watching for the train would then start the phone tree alerting the volunteers of the day \\"to put the coffee on.\\"<br />The wonderful work done in that Nebraska town now has been memorialized for the coming generations thanks to the amazing story told in the book.  It should be an inspiration to all of us for the future, which these days seems somewhat clouded.<br />My hat is off to Bob Greene and his painstakingly accurate research, the devoted mothers and daughters who served and cooked food, the reliable husbands and fathers who frequentlyacted as drivers, and to the remarkable service men and women who sent along their notes of thanks to North Platte while they were also occupied with fighting a war.<br />North Platte is still a special place.  The spirit of our country is alive and well there in the quiet town along the UP tracks where a century and a half ago another generation of equally determined Americans made their way west on the Oregon Trail.<br />For those of you interested in even more information on the North Platte Canteen, there is a wonderful website...	2002-06-17

I have to go back and find the rest of the books.  Jill Gregory gives the reader everything she wants. A romantic hero, a sweet and feisty heroine and a town filled with warmth and understanding where nothing can stop the romance between Emily and Clint. Our hearts warm to this pair who are at odds with each other.  It was one of the best romances I have read recently and has sent me searching for as many Jill Gregory books as I can find.	2002-04-17

It is the first of the Elm Creek books that I read and now I have purchased the rest to enjoy. The flow of the story was wonderful. And I easily moved between the days of Gerda and the modern day Sylvia.  It is at once a mystery and a tale of adventure and romance.  <br />Through Ms. Chiaverini's skillful writing, we feel equally at home in either the 19th or 21th centuries. So skillful and artistic are her desceiptions, that we, the readers are front and center with our two leading ladies at all times.<br />The cast of extras, from Hans and Andrew to Dorothea and Grace, all add to the rich tapestry that makes up this story.<br />Whether you are a quilter or not, this book puts us in touch with the past and reminds us to look back and see the fiber from which we are all made. If you are not a quilter, it certainly is an inspiration to try it out as a hobby  <br />We are never quite sure of the answer to the questions in Sylvia's mind, but that does not matter.  What we do know however, is that in her past were brave and daring people who stood for what was right in a time when so much was wrong.	2002-04-17

The story might be somewhat predicatable in that she reaches the heart of Guy first through his child and secondly with her warm devotion to his servents and finally with her unaffected smile and personality.<br />It might seem a bit melodramatic to have Lydia come sailing into the book, but that was necessary to give a little conflict to the story.  And in the end, she got her just desserts for the way she had treated everyone and acted over the past few months.<br />There was the grandeur of the British country house, the comeradie of the housestaff and the friendships and trust that Joanna had with the groom, Ran's mother and of course little Miles.  In other words, the book had everything to make it a fast read, but a wonderfully enjoyable one.<br />It was a book that I thoroughly enjoyed and made me want to dig out my other Katherine Kingsley's that I have stashed away.	2002-03-18

Somehow from the depths of hell and the jaws of death, there seem to be magical, romantic times and this book has it all.  <br />The most fascinating thing about the book was being able to get into the heads of the two main characters. We are with Len as he climbs into the desolute back country of Scotland, alone with him and his thoughts while a war is being fought hundreds of miles from where he is.<br />You can clearly see the strength of the British people over and over in the pilots' determination to fly many sorties each day, see their friends killed and go back and do the same thing the next day.  <br />After Sept. 11, I am convinced that we too might be able to go shopping in Oxford street while another part of London was being bombed.  Of course, your heart would not be in it, but showing courage and determination was just a big a part of defeating the enemy as were the Spitfires and Hurricanes.<br />For anyone who loves history and romance and the dramatic times of the 1940's, this book is a must read.  When you are finished you better understand the words of Winston Churchill when he said \\" that never in the course of history have so many owed so much to so few.\\"	2002-03-18

While I have always enjoyed Susan Wigg's book, especially her Chicago Fire Trilogy, Halfway to Heaven was somewhat laborious for me to read. In fact, it took me six weeks to get through it. Unlike some of her others that were real page turners where I could not wait to sit down and read, this was a book that I put down for a few days and then maybe only read a half a chapter at a time. I kept looking to the end pages to see how much was left.<br />The characters of Jamie and Abbie are very endearing and they are not the problem here. It just seemed that we knew the point of the story right in the beginning. The road to the conclusion seemed contrived if not predictable and it took way to long for me to get there.<br />It's not that it is a bad book, but it was a disappointing one considering some of her other wonderful works.	2002-03-07

Through her eyes we go beyond the covers of other books and see what it really meant to be a Lindbergh.  <br />They were almost a closed society onto themselves, yet they still experienced the same joys and sorrows as the rest of us.  We find the man who was depised as an isolationist to be a concerned and loving father who read to his children. <br />We dine with the children at their grandmother's house and we soar above the Connecticut house on Saturdays. The famed aviator at the controls and a bored child in the rear seat.<br />After reading this book I felt very attached to this famous family. Being the same age as Reeve herself, my only knowledge of the Lindbergh's was the famous flight and the kidnapping as I read in history books. Now, after this book, I feel as though I have become part of them.<br />It can only be summed up in one word, wonderful.	2002-02-26

While these normal and healthy young women bemoaned the lack of and longed for hot showers, beauty salons and the latest fashions, not one let their vanity get in the way of their work.  They did it all on the war front.  Cared for the sick, organized and ordered supplies, and delivered new planes. These were the women of the Army Nurse Corps, the Navy Nurses, the WAVES, WACS and SPARS. The women of the American Red Cross were just as important and I was fascinated to learn that they too were taught how to handle firearms and themselves in all wartime situations.<br />Through the words of these women, we hear about their friends, love life, battles, air raids and typical military humor. Their thoughts always strayed toward home, but they were all in agreement about one thing. They would not trade places. Each knew that this experience would change them forever. I am sure it did. Their successful work during that time certainly changed the roles of all women forever.	2002-02-15

Some have been so awful that after 50 pages, they go to the used bookshop. So it is was pleasure to find one that was so readable and enjoyable.  Of course, with Debbie at the keys, this is not surprising.<br />While there is some fragmented areas, like the transition between characters, it didn't matter. I just could not stop. The little town of Cedar Cove is charming and the people are real people, doing things that most of us do each day. Work, workout with a friend, shop and run to the cleaners.  And none of us live in a fairy tale world. These women don't either. However, Jack's friend Bob does seem to have the one stable marriage in the book. And at least Olivia and Stan have a civil relationship.  <br />The approach to the solution for Cecilia's and Ian's marriage allows for much growth in their maturity level. Actually we see alot of growth in the book. The grandson of Tom Harding overcoming his reluctance to take his grandfather's mementos, Grace developing some independence and Justine, looking past the glitter of a superficial relationship and finding true love in someone crystal clear and wholesome.<br />I think that some loose ends were left at the end intentionally and that in the next book ( which is hinted at), we will probably find out what happened to Grace's husband and see Jack and Olivia weather some ups and downs. Of course, I am just guessing, but that is what I would like to see.<br />This one is a keeper and I will read it again.	2002-01-01

She wants us to look beyond our materialistic world, to look beyond the people we are in the world we know. All a very valid message.<BR>  <BR>I find her message in the acknowledgement section somewhat confusing, that perhaps this is not Amelia Earhart afterall, that the reader should make up their own minds. If not Amelia Earhart, then why the companion named Fred, the talk of the fame that this woman knew would surround her when she arrived home and the references to the lost Electra.<br />Lucy and Robin were not terribly heartwarming characters in my opinion. They both seemed quite immature, self centered and shallow and I doubt that in the long term they would be able to hold a relationship together. They probably matured from their experience, but I think they might find being full time parents rather boring and I see each of them drifting into their old lives and habits, leaving the child to almost raising itself.<br />As to the woman that the author suggests to be Earhart, she has no choice as to the life she has led on this island, though I find it somewhat unlikely that after 40 years rumors from the Japanese and some natives might not have caused someone to come and take another look.<br />Inspite of the above criticisms, it was a fast read with a rather predictable ending.	2001-11-14

When I first opened Alice's Tulips, I was a bit taken aback, because I did not know that the entire book was made of up letters to her sister. But by the time I finished I knew Alice, her mother, and her sister as well as my own neighbors.The supporting characters of the town are revealed to us in rich detail through the observations of Alice in her letters.  We come in contact here with the prejudices of the day, the horrors of battle and some surprising ideas and suggestions from her sister that cross Alice's mind. Something that we surely think now women of that time would not have been so bold to think about.<br />This is truly a heartwarming story, perfect to cuddle up with on a winter's afternoon.	2001-10-23

Here and there the author gets bogged down with such details as to the addresses of people that are involved with Jackie.  The beginning section that deals with Jackie's childhood reveals not only her knowledge in dealing with such men as her father, but explains how she survived the behavior of JFK.  The part of the book that takes place just prior to the assasination brings to the reader a bittersweet explanation of how they had finally found a closeness with each other that was enjoyed all too briefly.<br />Jackie was criticized by the press, plagued by photographers and misunderstood by the Kennedy family. With her unique personality, she manages to rise above it all and give some semblance of normalcy to her life and that of her children.<br />After reading the book, while I understand her better, I can't say for sure that I would have enjoyed being her friend.  Her emotions seemed a bit too volatile for comfort.<br />I give the book high marks. Clearly there has been intensive research done here.  Except in one of the photos of Jackie leaving for the Inaugural Gala.  That was the night of Jan. 19th, not the 20th.<br />This one is going on my bookshelf to stay with the rest of my first lady collection.	2001-10-23

With the whole world rocking around us, I found such comfort and peace cuddling up each night and soaking up the sensations of Queenie's afternoon quilting sessions.  Through the dark days of the depression, these strong women found comfort through routine, beauty in simplicity and inner peace from the rhymthic flow of their needles through the fabric. The fact that a mystery becomes a part of all of this only enhances the story. I guess one of the nicest things about the story is that it reminds us that we too need to pick up the threads of our lives in difficult times and that the mundane activities of daily living are to be all the more appreciated due to the uncertainties of life.  The bleak atmosphere of the depression comes alive with the colorful personalities that the author has created.	2001-09-27

This book arrived early this afternoon and in two hours I had read it from cover and cover. Then I went back and studied each picture again. Jackie's style was so classic and timeless. She was an example of elegant dressing and showed the world the meaning of grace under pressure. Many times in my own life I looked back on her dignity and courage in the darkest days of her life and found the strength to go on myself. It was wonderful to see some new pictures and be reminded of a time of true elegance. Looking closely at the various photos you can see how Jackie's style influenced the clothes of Diana and more recently, Queen Rania of Jordan.	2001-09-06

She has the perfect mix of characters in the small Alaska town of Hard Luck and just the right number of inconveniences that one would encounter living above the Artic Circle.  <br />The first short story about Mitch and Bethany is truly heartwarming. Equally sweet is the happy ending Bethany finds to another part of her life.  That section of the book was hard to put down.<br />The second story about Matt and Karen was good, but the constant bickering and on and offs of their relationship got to the point of belaboring the issue.  I think that with one or two of their arguments omitted, it would still would have worked.  It got to the point in 'Because of the Baby', that I kept reading because I felt obligated to finish the book. Maybe looking for some redeeming quality.  <br />Overall, I have to say that the book is great for some nice, light reading. They are stories with warm and sincere charcters.  I have bought several more of her books, because they are well written and tasteful. And even if Matt and Karen went at each other at bit too much for me, Ms. Macomber is an author will worth following.	2001-08-18

The heroes and heroines are warm, likeable characters. Supporting them throughout the story are the kindly, interesting people that one would meet in a remote Alaskan town. Having traveled there myself, I could picture perfectly the makeshift buildings and open tundra that made up the town of Hard Luck.  The two brothers, Sawyer and Charles, were gentlemanly and honest. Their soon to be spouses also were the kind of women you would have wanted for your friends and neighbors.  The two children of Abby, Susan and Scott, were absolutely delightful and added yet another charming dimension to an already heartwarming story.<br />Since this book has two separate stories, it is perfect for taking on a trip.  With a short flight or quick soak in a tub, there is a chance to make some progress and actually finish a book.	2001-08-09

The main characters had good, strong pioneer qualities. Twila,Uncle Nate, Josh, Rye and Theresa were perfect in their supporting roles. I am also certain that surly people like Mr. Pollard and others who followed his lead were around after the Civil War. It was a time when wounds both physical and emotional were raw.  However,I had several complaints about the book.  In one area, Ms. Sterling did not do her homework.  On page 45, she has Mrs. Sorenson buying quilts to send to Sweden to be sold in a shop there, because quilts are not available there. Apparently, Ms. Sterling has never seen the book 'Old Swedish Quilts' which documents and chronicles Swedish quilt making in the last two centuries.  Among the special treasures are Swedish wedding quilts.  I also was somewhat offended at the character of Mrs. Sorenson. She is made out to be rather greedy and unpleasant and being of Swedish heritage, I found the descriptions of her offensive.  Her dialog is written more to the cadence of German and nowhere is the singsong Swedish dialect mentioned.  Once again, a good read, but would hope for better research next time.	2001-05-29

The back of the book, which I purchased at an airport promises a love that can make dreams comes true and talks about the consuming passion of Pierce.  If I hadn't been stuck on a plane and had nothing to do, I would have happily left this book in the airport club or the hotel wastebasket.  I would not have wasted my time reading it.<br />It is very hard to get wrapped up in a story about the two main characters when their only interactions include meeting at a school for a few minutes and several quick visits to a skating rink.  Less than 20% of the book is devoted to them.  And while the story of Giselle and Garek is somewhat interesting, way too much time was devoted to them.  There really was no plot.  Just conversations of Giselle and Garek. Even the characters mentioned in the beginning of the book, Val, Edward, Melissa etc. melt to nothingness by the end.

This is not only my favorite Heather Graham book, but my favorite of the Civil War Cameron family series.  Christa reminds me of myself in some ways. A little brash,impetuous. Acting first, thinking second. Both she and Jeremy are likeable and realistic. While fulfillment of their relationship takes awhile to gel, in the end there is no doubt that these two are meant to be together.  One of the nice things about this book is that the way Graham has worked in Christa's brothers and wives has made it a stand alone work. You don't need to necessarily read the first two to grasp what the family is all about.  I have kept this book and reread it about once a year.	2001-05-19

Especially the trilogy of One Wore Blue etc. I just picked this one up at the store, not realizing this too was part of a series.  While the book held my interest and I wanted to continue through the end, I found it a bit frustrating.  With all the T names, Taylor, Tia, Teela and Tara and the R's, Ria and Rhiannon things started to blur together. When the names of five or six family members started to appear on each page, I felt the author was rushing to squeeze in too much, too fast.  Also at the end, it says that Tia named her first daughter Hope.  But a few pages later, it seems unclear when it says that they were happy to have four sons and finally a daughter.  I definitely am a Heather Graham fan and will look for more of her books, but hope that the next one takes it a bit slower. There was a distinct feeling that there was a rush to get every detail of each character settled before the end of the book.  It was an ambitious project to be sure, but in some cases, I felt that it took away from the story of Tia and Taylor, who by the way, were two very appealing characters.	2001-05-19

I had to admire Lucy. She was a woman ahead of her time, both in her views of women's rights, but as well as racial issues.  She had a deep and abiding trust and regard for her African American friend Patience, who is a reverend.<br />Lucy and Rand had eyes for each other since the night of the fire. The only thing stopping their relationship that night was the presence of Diana.  If you read closely you can see the relationship develop subtley. He wanted real love but thought his scars made him hideous. Lucy craved love, but was afraid to show it.  Afraid it would hamper her crusade for women's voting.<br />They were wonderful characters and they way they handled little Maggie and how she brought them together makes it a heartwarming story not soon to be forgotten.<br />Ms. Wiggs has also done her homework as far as the Chicago Fire is concerned. Being born and raised here, it was something we learned about in school.  All her facts are true and she has very nicely included some of the Chicagoans of that time in some cameo roles.	2001-05-05

Miller has given us the flavor of modern Springwater plus allowing the characters the chance to reverently appreciate the legacy of the early citizens who built the town.  <br />It is truly Maggie's and JT's story and if the problems of the people around them are not totally well developed, I feel that in no way does this take away from the romance of our two lovers.<br />You feel the pain they suffered from losing each other so many years ago, feel the sadness as their first marriages ended and without doubt experience the unremitting joy as they rediscover their relationship.<br />The arrival of JT's little boy only cements Maggie's and JT's feelings for one another. It also allows us to see briefly into the window of his past when his first wife brings Quinn to Montana.<br />This will be a book to take to the beach, the pool or anywhere else you want to go and just be pleasantly entertained.

Years ago I had seen the movie that was made based on the book &quot;The Emmigrants.&quot; While I found the movie interesting then, I believe that reading the book now as a more mature adult really opened my eyes to what the very early immigrants struggled against as they came to America.  My own grandparents came later, in 1909, and that trip would have seemed like a picnic compared to Karl Oscar and Kristina's voyage. Still though many things had not changed all that much. My grandfather, also named Carl, complained all the time of how they had been made to study the cathecism all the time. He longed for a broader education so that he really could have made something of himself.  He always said that in Sweden when he was growing up, the church had a say in everything.  Just like Karl Oscar.  I found some of the same superstitions that were written about still lived on in the mind of my great aunt.  <br />I felt that this was an extremely well researched, warmly written book.  The characters came alive on the pages and I became so involved in their voyage that I felt that I too walked the decks of the Charlotta.<br />This book is not only for those os Swedish descent, but for anyone whose family came across in those early days of settling in America.	2001-03-25

I gave a great deal of credit to Banner who made it to the top as far as women of that time were concerned.  A fine match for her feisty mother in law.  It's a romance, so it would be believable or even likely that they could have fallen in love in a week or a day.  And besides, once in awhile it happens in real life.  The main characters were playful and charming and if he spanked her once or twice, I don't believe it was spousal abuse.  But this was another place or another time. It wouldn't work in a story set now, but let's hope it was just a lighthearted way to handle her willfulness. In anycase, it did not detract from the book.  When I found that there was yet another Corbin book, I ordered it as fast as I could.	2001-02-17

However, once I started reading, I could not stop. When I compared what he wrote about the early years of the 1900's to the fifties, when I could first remember things, Allen's descriptions fit to a T, just what my mother and grandmother had told me. And when I got to the section where I was alive, I felt right at home.  He is right on target with the words, phrases and ideas of the way we  were.  If you are expecting a detailed history of the last century, this is not the book for you.  But what this little book does, is capture the essence of each decade concisely and cleverly. And then if you are really interested you can go on and seek out other books on the history of that particular era. I am going to keep mine and one day let grandchildren read it.	2001-01-27

After the romance of Aidan and Jude, I hoped that the others would be as spellbinding and delightful. I found the story of Brenna and Shawn somewhat contrived and uninspiring and this last between Darcy and Trevor somewhat lacking in electricity as well. While the two main characters are strong individuals and the legends woven into the story make it interesting, I find Darcy a little too flippant to be a very lovable character and Trevor a little too concerned with business.  The ending picked up a little, but frankly this was a book that I started, then read a few pages here and there, only to put it down for several weeks, not really caring if I finished it or not. I would not go racing to buy it.	2001-01-10

One never thinks about the tearful goodbye's to a reporter's loved ones before leaving on a dangerous assignment. Nor considers the unpleasant conditions which much be endured while reporting such a story.  I found that the book put a much more human face on neat and tidy reports we see on the evening news.  It was also interesting to hear Ted's take on the major news stories of the year. Opinions that could not be shared on national TV. <br />It gave a certain level of comfort to know that a person who has such control over what we hear of the news, is really just a regular person who goes to the store, gets gas for his car and is excited about the birthday of his grandson.<br />A quick read. I skimmed some parts about the Chechen's. But then isn't what he said in the book after all.  We, as a nation ,are not too interested in that news.	2000-11-22

The intelligent way Ms. Wulf handles Diana's introduction to the Cheyenne culture, makes us wish we had been there too.  I was not aware until I read other reviews that there was a Beaudine saga. I must get the rest of the books.  I enjoyed this one from cover to cover.	2000-09-23

And how I looked forward to this one.  But I came away disappointed.  Brenna and Shawn didn't seem to kindle that same fire of love and the  situations created that forced them apart, seemed somehow very contrived  and unnatural.  The descriptions of Ireland and the family life there was  wonderful.  Even including the legend rings true to the country, but all in  all this was not one of my favorites and at times had to work hard to read  the book.	2000-07-19

I would savor the descriptions of the &quot;shivery and crunchy&quot; frozen salad and Roxanne necking in the back of Doreen's Drugstore.  Having grown up in the same period, it was  refreshing to reminisce about setting your hair on juice cans, using  Dippity Doo, and picking out the right clothes for your college wardrobe.   We all have met people like Aunt Ruthie and Roxanne's parents.  And we have  experienced similar life events to what Roxanne saw.  The difference is the  way Karen Stolz writes about them.  In this refreshing and too short story  about a young girl's passage to womanhood and motherhood, we are all right  there in Annette, Texas with her.  I only hope that the author writes more.   This one is a keeper.	2000-07-03

She has captured the magic of the country and  the charisma of the people. The two lovers, Aidan and Jude are warm and  wonderful.  She had created charming neighbors and friends that interact  with the main characters.  This was one book that I could not put down and  have been tantalized for the next book in the series after reading the  preview.  This is one book I am saving to read over again on some rainy  afternoon.  I highly recommend it.	2000-02-11

There were fascinating tidbits on how places were named, how history was written and wars were fought.  It abounds in trivia that  will impress your dinner companions.  The calendar was a brilliant way to  organize the information. I would sit down with my breakfast and read about  a month each morning. I learned a great deal in the 199 pages. While the  book focuses mainly on life in England, there is also information thrown in  about the Vikings and other northern European countries.  The last  paragraph makes you think. We have more of everything than those people,  but what we do not possess is the knowledge to survive as they did.	1999-12-18

When it was over,I purchased the book and have since read many of the vignettes that it contains. Each story  is filled with tender details of how nature and animals have helped people  come to grips with illness and sadness.  The book shows us how the world  around us can help us come to terms with various problems and conditions in  life.  I work in the field of Animal Assisted Therapy and have found this  book an inspiration to what I do.  Bring Me An Ocean validates what I see  everyday with my dog when we visit hospitals.  The gentle touch of an  animal or the opportunity for a patient to smell a flower or touch a  seashell sometimes provides more healing that all the medicine in the  world.  For anyone who loves nature and wants to nuture the souls of loved  ones who may be ill, or not, this book is a must.	1999-12-14

The lead characters are so genuinely appealing and realistic.  There is everything in this book, history, atmosphere, humor, drama, passion and love.  I can't  wait for her next book. It was the first book in a long time that I could  not put down.  Loved every word!	1999-10-08

It is a wonderful celebration of the life of a self educated and outspoken woman.  This book is also a social history covering everything from mode of dress  and mining history to the suffragette movement and the sinking of the  Titanic.  Ms. Iversen has  done her work and the reader really gets to know  the intimate workings of the Tobin and Brown families.  Once in awhile she  goes off on a tangent about someone close to Molly Brown.  The only  criticism comes at the very end of the book.  The meticulous research falls  apart briefly in the Envoi section.  The author has the Carpathia arriving  in New York four nights after the Titanic set sail.  She also says that 161  people that were rescued in the lifeboats died.  I have read many books  about the Titanic including the bible of the topic itself, A Night To  Remember and I have never seen that before. There were a few that died in  the lifeboats and never made it to the deck of Carpathia, but if Ms Iversen  says that 161 people died after being picked up from the lifeboats, that is  information that has been omitted from all the 30 Titanic books that I own  and I would be very interested to know where she got that figure.  All in  all though a book well worth reading, Titanic fan or not.  Margaret Brown  was a woman ahead of her times.	1999-08-02

But I have also used them in another way.  They worked very well in a group therapy session on a rehab unit  where we passed around the easier cards, such as self esteem and  boundaries, etc. and got the patients talking about how such topics  affected their lives.  They enjoyed the discussion as it was a totally  different approach and were still talking about it several weeks later.	1999-04-19
US	51954266	RE3R7MBCVNJ0H	0812545966	296347762	Lorena	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Good historical fiction, restrained romance	As a person who happens to enjoy civil war history, I found the historical perspectives really interesting.  I thought that the main characters showed the emotional restraints appropriate to the times.  But it was not a book I  wanted to cuddle up and read.  The constant discussion of sawing off limbs,  while a part of that period, was not exactly conducive to a restful sleep.   It had good historical detail, nice characters, kept your interest, and  moved quickly.  While this seems to be a love story, there is too much  &quot;blood and guts&quot; in the book to really consider it a true romance  novel.	1999-03-03

While it moved fast, I did not find the characters appealing or sensitive.  In fact, they seemed cheap and certainly went well with the venues of the story.  This  book may appeal to those who like the tabloid talk shows, but to the  readers who enjoy the gentile and refined characters of the more classy  romances, this book is NOT for you.	1999-02-20
