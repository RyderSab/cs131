I can't say enough good things about this book! It covers more than just nursing, however.  <br /> <br />The first section is entitled \\"You Too Can Get Through Nursing School.\\" Chapters here include: Study and Test-Taking Skills, Papers, Computers, Texts, Faculty Variability, Asssertiveness, Professional Possibilities, Legal Considerations, and Risk Management. This section covers the basics of getting you through school. The study tips chapter was especially useful to me. <br /> <br />Other sections include \\"Universal Issues That You Will Encounter Wherever You Go,\\" (which includes Culture, Stress, Pain, Rehabilitation, etc); \\"Concepts That Are Difficult to Understand,\\" (which incudes ABGs, Endocrine, Drug Calculations, ECG, etc); \\"Content You Needs To Know,\\" (which has just 3 chapters: Critical Thinking, Research, and Theory); \\"How to Get Your Point Across,\\" (which includes Communicaiton, Documentation, and Nursing Process); and a final section entitled \\"How to Access Information Via the Internet and Beyond.\\" <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to you. It is a wonderful resource as it explains hard concepts AND teaches you study skills, how to get along with others, and so much more!	2005-10-12

Each chapter is devoted to one aspect of not \\"sweating the small stuff.\\" Why aren't we told these things *before* we get married?

Some people may find this book biased because the author tells you how you can talk to people of other faiths about Christianity. I learned quite a bit from this book and feel that much more confident in my decision to be a Christian and raise a Christian family. The compared religions are Buddhism, Jadaism, Taoism, Animism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Marxism, New Age Movement, Secularism, and Shinto. There are many grpahs and charts. It is formatted in a very easy to read context.	2004-09-16

I learned quite a bit here. Basically, good exercise (and he provides many, many tips on this) is the key to having a healthy body. And he doesn't think dieting is a good idea. I like this guy.

It was so helpful! He talks about shapes, imperfections, setting, fakes, and on and on. He covers every aspect of the diamond industry, and includes proposal ideas and other anecdotes. He definately knows what he's talking about. He has a very strict guide for jewelers and I know that most stores will not live up to his expectations (like a lifetime complete refund... that's fairly rare).

Finally someone put into words what I could not. This book points out how husbands are insensitive to their wives and how they can change that. It shows the differences between men and women, which do make a big difference in a relationship. It also gives you specific tips and ideas on how to show your love and be the husband she deserves. It is not a male-bashing book by any means. I think that some men cannot accept that they are insensitive from a woman's point of view and are therefore resitant to change. Please, read this book. Read it with your wife, even, and get her opinion. You will be glad you did.	2004-08-30

To the more conservative people out there, she does find homosexuality to be natural and okay, which you may or may not agree with.

Yes, if a woman is carrying a baby, she should be extra careful, but this is ridiculous. Women have odd cravings sometimes, and sometimes, they can only keep down certain foods, even if those foods are not completely healthy. This book made me very stressed out while I was pregnant. She made me feel as if I was going to have a deformed child if I did not adhere to a strict diet. But, thank you, my son was perfectly healthy, and my diet was less than perfect. If you must get this book, buy it used or borrow it.	2004-08-26

The format is very easy to read, lots of fun, and simply informative. It's fairly thick, but a regular size t oeasily fit in your nightstand. The nudity is not vulgar. If I remember correctly, all you see is breasts and butts, no genitals. So, if that offends you, avoid this book. Also, check out Pure Sex. This author is amazing!	2004-08-23

The author directly says that ALL men WILL cheat if they are not COMPLETELY satisfied sexually. And it's their wives' fault! I thought there would be a lot of sexual techniques to learn in here. No! She recommended role-playing, so sex would be like being with different women. The whole point of this book... no matter what a wife does for her husband (cooks, cleans, takes care of the children, etc) it will NEVER be good enough because he needs to have lots of sexual excitement or he WILL find it elsewhere. Love has nothing to do with it. At all. Save yourself the money and find a better book. The Guide to Gettign It On is fantastic. SO is Pure Sex by Anne Hooper.	2004-08-23

It's all government programs to pay your rent, bills, tuition, etc. I'd split the cost with a few friends and take turns reading it. Even used, this isn't a big bargain. There was a total of THREE programs that would be useful to me. Not that great.	2004-08-23

You could learn basic Spanish grammar and words. However, I would buy it used. It's not very in-depth as it could be. Still, a good book!	2004-08-23

This is a terrific book on how to honestly affair-prrof yoru marriage. It has the top ten needs, half of which are more common to women (affection, conversation, honesty and openness, financial support, and famiyl commitment) and half of which are more common to men (sexual fulfillment, recreational companionship, an attractive spouse, domestic support, and admiration). The author admits that affairs are common nad tries to give couples ways to not fall into that trap. This is a must-have for every couple...engaged, newlywed, or married for 50 years. There is tons of useful information in here.	2004-08-23

There are tons of great ideas, a lot I had never thought of. There were some that seem like common sense in a loving relationship. What I didn't like was there was a LOT of repetition of ideas and a lot of ideas for millionaires. Sorry, but a unlimited shopping spree on Rodeo Drive or hopping a Concorde to Paris are just not in my budget. But, there were some cool phrases you could say in different languages and lots of romantic movie and song ideas. I definately recommend getting this book.	2004-08-08
