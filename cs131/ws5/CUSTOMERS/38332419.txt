About the only thing they have in common is their love for Theddeus Brown.  In P.L. Hampton's Love is Never Easy, Theddeus is a newly divorced African American man living in Minnesota.  Through a mutual friend he and Ivy meet at a bid whist party.  Immediately, they hit it off and begin to spend all of their spare time together.  Eventually, Theddeus thinks they are getting a little too close and informs Ivy he needs a little space. During his hiatus Theddeus meets Erin and before he knows it, he is caught up in a love triangle.   <br /> <br />This novel did an excellent job of exploring the issues facing single black women on the dating scene as well as interracial relationships.  Although I saw Theddeus and Ivy's relationship grow as they got to know each other, I feel the author did not give the reader the same sense of closeness between  Erin and Theddeus as the aforementioned couple.  Other than a couple of  sexual encounters and a time when Theddeus cried on Erin's shoulder, we got very few glimpses of them sharing the type of intimacy that would dictate love. In fact, most of their encounters were filled with tension. This would not have been an issue had this book not been about Theddeus' love for both women. Overall, this was an entertaining read which explored the love life of two women; one white and one black; both looking for love.   <br /> <br />If romance is your genre, take a trip into Theddeus' world with P.L. Hampton and find out that love truly is never easy. <br /> <br />T. RHYTHM KNIGHT <br />APOOO BookClub  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-03

Hampton, is the story of a young woman who rediscovers herself after a marriage gone sour.  Shortly after learning of her husband's unfaithfulness, Chrysanthemum, or Chris, as she is called, leaves Atlanta to visit Jacksonville, Georgia.  While there, Chris not only finds out that her great grandmother is a black woman, she learns that she possesses a gift that is somehow connected to a great uncle who was lynched by the Klan. Forced to face her past, Chris learns that it is overwhelmingly connected to the future. <br /> <br />While the plot was interesting, I found this story to be largely distracting.  There were many instances where the author chose dialogue which was supposed to imitate southern accents.  I found myself reading paragraphs several times before I was able to decipher what the author was trying to convey.  From the scene where a diner was segregated (although he described the setting as the present) to the scene where Chris was offered a plate of chitterlings by the black folk, I felt the author over exaggerated his depiction of the South. In addition, it was not until the middle of the story that I knew the race of the main character.  This generated a sense of not really knowing the characters since there was never any real description of Chris, her husband, her mother, or her best friend. <br /> <br />Despite the dialogue, the plot was unique and interesting.  If you like stories which border on the supernatural, you may find this book interesting. <br /> <br />T. RHYTHM KNIGHT <br />APOOO BookClub <br /> <br />	2005-09-11

In the end, Ben is forced to become a man in Enrico Theoc's debut novel, Willing to Live. <br /> <br />I found this novel to be unrealistic.  Although Ben is devastated over his parents' disappearance, he participates in criminal behavior, hits on two women and has sex with another. It appears that Ben's interest in \\"bling-bling\\" and women are more important than finding the whereabouts of his parents. While Theoc's  grammar and writing style are intact, the development of his characters and plot leave a little to be desired.  Theoc shows immense potential, and in the future I look forward to reading other works from him as he matures as a writer. <br /> <br />T.

Grace is a singer in a club in New Orleans.  One night stands are her specialty until she meets a  handsome stranger, Julian Richard.  Immediately, Julian recognizes his former self in Grace and tries to convince her that love is worth finding.  Although Grace tries to seduce Julian out of the commitment he  has made to remain celibate, he remains steadfast.  Julian's gentlemanly ways shake Grace's world right down to its foundation; causing her to take a look at why she does not want to be in a committed relationship.  Grace does not have to look far--the answer lies in her childhood with a mother that she has grown to despise. As much as Grace hates to admit it, she cannot move forward until she unloads some of the bondage that keeps her chained to the past. <br /> <br />This was a nicely written novel, with a strong plot.  The story moved along at a nice pace and the characters were well-developed.  I found myself cheering Grace along as she came to grips with the issues that kept her from accepting love.

Johnson's, Camille's Dilemma.  The story, as told through the eyes of a spirit named Louise, a former slave, starts when Camille is a child living in the projects.  It continues throughout Camille's childhood and into adulthood.  As Camille grows, she discovers her sexuality and soon comes to grips with who she is. <br /> <br />I found this book to be distracting and confusing.  The story was not only told through the eyes of Louise, but through the eyes of Camille and the narrator as well.  Oftentimes, it was difficult to tell who was narrating the story.  For example, Louise spoke with a certain dialect and in the first person. The narrator often picked up the same dialect and used first person as well.  Other times, the narrator spoke in third person omniscient.  In addition, sometimes when the author switched from points of view, she would \\"warn\\" the reader by having the narrator say something like:  \\"I'll talk to you later, bye.\\" This proved to be distracting. <br /> <br />In the past, I have read a few novels that adapted the concept of a story being told by multiple narrators. Even then, there is a scene break which lets the reader know that the other voice will be picking up the story. Unfortunately, Johnson has not mastered the craft well enough to adapt such a complex writing technique.   <br /> <br />Despite my rating for this book, I predict great things from this author as plot and character development were on point. <br /> <br />T.

The reason--she does not know the first thing about kissing. The situation becomes more heated when Kedren, the high school cutie takes up residence in Skylar's heart.  In the end, Skylar learns more than how to kiss as she discovers Blair and Kedren's secret. <br /> <br />Although this book was well-written, I had a difficult time rating and reviewing it.  This is a book written for and about teenagers.  As such, it is hard for me to gauge the excitement and realness that the book generates.  The storyline is a bit far-fetched, in my opinion, because the author depicts teenagers as spies and being involved in highly sophisticated crimes.  Pre-teens or teens, however,  may find it exciting and believable. <br /> <br />If you have a teenager, this may not be a bad read.  The story is clean and may prove entertaining. <br /> <br />T.

Although Stella is pregnant, and Kevin's unfaithfulness hurts her, Stella refuses to see the warning signs.  Blind to the obvious in each relationship thereafter, Stella does not see her errors in judgment of character and continues to make the same mistakes over-and-over. It is no surprise when turmoil and sadness become Stella's constant companions.  Tired of the status quo, she takes a step back and puts her love life in God's hands. <br /> <br />I found this novel to be lacking when it came to suspense and conflict.  The novel had a lot of material to work with but failed to keep my interest.  Although Stella was interesting and so were her relationships, there was more telling then showing.  With a little more plot and some action or suspense, this story could have been a little more engaging.   If this is a self-help book the story would have benefited if the author had told it more in a nonfiction voice rather than fiction.  If this story was meant to be fiction, the needed elements of suspense and conflict were missing.   <br /> <br />Once Victor studies the craft, avoids point of view and change in voice conflicts, and decides if she will be a fiction or non-fiction wirter, she will recognize her potential to become an excellent writer. <br /> <br />T.

Meanwhile, through unforeseen circumstances, Caridad moves her lesbian friend into their apartment and ends up exploring a homosexual relationship.  The question then becomes, can Yolara and Caridad accept each other's choices in romance and still respect each other?    Although this book had an excellent plot and characters that were well-developed, lack of tension and conflict were areas where it fell short. There were several instances where situations that should have been packed with tension and conflict were not.  For instance, Yolara falls in love with the father of her mother's children, and her mother readily accepts it.  On the flip side, Caridad brings a lesbian home and they become a couple. Yolara then accepts her mother's first-time lesbian relationship with no problem whatsoever.      I do, however, recommend reading this book.

Despite his many wives, Nick cannot satisfy his insatiable desire for women and stops at nothing to get them; even though he is a prominent member of his church.      In Big Blue's case the sins of the father have devastating effects on his off spring, and in Nick's case everything he touches eventually turns to dust - including the lives of Big Blue's adult children who attend the same church as he.     Although I understood the message of this book very well, I often became confused as to who the author intended her audience to be. Even though the book was supposed to be Christian in nature, this book read like any other erotic book on the shelves.  Not only did the book contain a lot of erotic material, it contained an over abundance of cuss words as well.   Occasionally, there was reference to how the story was biblically related, but it was not until the end that Rolyat made her point by preaching to the reader and listing  STDs.  This book could have been an exceptional witnessing tool had it been presented in a less explicit (even though the theme was how unholy sex destroys lives) and a more concise manner.      There are two types of audiences this book may be of interest to:  (1) People who enjoy inspirational fiction and do not  mind excessive cuss words and erotica; or (2) People who enjoy  erotic urban/street lit and do not mind being preached to.      If you fall into either of the above categories, this book may be of interest to you.    (...)	2004-12-22

Ceazia is a girl that is determined to live the good life at any cost, even if it means being the girlfriend of Vegas, one of Virginia's most notorious drug dealers. Together, Ceazia and Vegas build a solid relationship made out of love, mutual respect, and trust which serve as the foundation.  But, just when they think they have put all of the pieces of their lives together, a course of events threaten to tear them apart.  The question then becomes can they withstand the gusting winds of murder and deceit that threaten to tear them up, or will their house of love crumble in the storm?   <br /> <br />I found this book to be a fast-paced read with a lot of twists and turns which were underdeveloped and did not make a lot of sense. The characters were a bit over the top with their desires to achieve material things, thus making them a bit unbelievable on occasion, especially when taking their upper middle-class upbringing into consideration.  The main plot, however, was believable and the end contained an awesome twist. Chunichi definitely has a talent for bringing the streets right off the pages and into your living room, and I definitely look forward to reading more of her work as she develops her talent in the future.   <br /> <br />If you are into urban fiction and have an appetite for Gucci, guns and lust, A Gangster's Girl, by Chunichi may prove to be an interesting read. <br /> <br />T.

Each story is comprised of different people that make up a neighborhood. From the pastor that loves to \\"lay hands\\" on the ladies, to the man who lives across the street that beats his wife behind closed doors, to the down low brother around the corner, each story is told vividly and realistically. <br /> <br />I found this book to be an easy and fun read. Although the book is entitled Somewhere In America, the characters in this book can be found anywhere; including your very own back door.   While some of the stories were funny, some sad, and some thought provoking, each contained something that any African American man or woman could relate to.  At the end, Malore summarizes everyone's story through the eyes of an old lady that sits on her porch and observes the \\"goings ons\\" in the neighborhood - <br />this proved to be a nice twist. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a fun and easy read, find somewhere to relax and pick up a copy of Somewhere In America.

Throughout the night secrets and revelations unfold between the friends which strengthen their bond of sisterhood. <br /> <br />I found this book to be uniquely and wonderfully written.  As the friends read the book aloud, they stopped at intervals to discuss the book, argue, and cry.  I had never read a book which contained a story within a story, but found this one to be intriguing.  It was like being at an actual book club meeting while the book was simultaneously being read and discussed.   <br /> <br />The plot of Small Packages is extremely erotic and will keep you engrossed as does the subplot - the discussion between the friends.

The format was not like anything that I have ever seen.  Some of the chapters were proceeded by one piece of poetry, others by several pieces of poetry, and some none at all.  In addition, the print vacillated between italics, regular print, and bold.  The dialogue between the characters was written as if it were a transcript or some sort of script for a play. The entire book proved to be a huge distraction.  With a more concise way of presenting the material, perhaps this book could have been a more interesting read.  <br />T.

Debrena has been a dancer since she could remember.  At the age of ten, she meets Lorrie at an audition.  Debrena and Lorrie become fast friends cultivating a friendship that spans years of trials, tribulations and triumphs.  Lorrie knows who she is, and openly admits to being gay.  Debrena appears to be clueless as she rides a rocky road to self-discovery on a dirt road, filled with pot holes. While Debrena tries to piece her life together,  Lorrie is faced with the dilemma of riding the tide with her or drifting off to calmer seas.<BR>  <BR>There was so much tension and conflict that the author could have shared with the reader, yet she failed to hit home.  The struggles that one must deal with when coming to terms with their sexuality has to be difficult; at times heart-wrenching.  Yet, this character seemed to deny who she was vehemently one day, and come to terms with what she has denied all her life overnight.  In addition, the book had a few areas which just did not add up.  For example, Debrena gave Tyra, a girl she met at an audition her number.  A few days later Tyra declares she is across the street of Debrena's house, and asks to come over.  This proved distracting since Debrena never mentioned where she lived to Tyra.  <br />Overall, the book was pretty well-written and with a little more tension and attention to detail, Dancer's Paradise:  An Erotic Journey, could have been an excellent read.  The author is a talented writer with a niche in a subject that's not overly saturated by African American authors. I do look forward to other works from this author in the future.  If you like erotic literature, Paradise awaits.<BR>  <br />T. RHYTHM KNIGHT<BR>APOOO BookClub	2004-07-03

Each story is written  by spouses, lovers,  perpetrators of affairs and the children which are a result of them.  In The Other Child:  Children of Affairs, each writer gives an account of the devastation experienced when children are produced as a result of infidelity.<br />In my opinion,  the contents of the book differed from the title.  I found the majority of the stories to be more about women scorned rather than about the other children produced from their mate's unfaithfulness. Some of the stories were well-written, and some were incoherent ravings.  Although the characters in each story slightly differed, the contents in almost all of the stories were the same; hatred of the spouse, hatred of the other man/woman, and hatred of the other child. While some of the people that shared their stories were able to move on, the majority were not.  <br />If you are the other child, and you are looking for a book which explores how others in your situation feel, this book may not be helpful.  Only a handful of the stories were written by the actual other children, which may prove disappointing if you interested in hearing  their stories versus their parents'.  On the other hand, if you are going through a relationship where a mate has been unfaithful,  this book may prove helpful.   <br />T. RHYTHM KNIGHT<BR>APOOO BookClub	2004-07-03

After a particularly brutal day, John's mother wanders into a grocery store owned by a local Chinese woman and goes into labor. On the floor of the store, she gives birth to a beautiful baby boy that looks Caucasian with grey eyes.  <BR> <BR>Madam Hung Chin takes John and his mother in and loves them as if they were her own. Although she's barely getting by, she shares everything she has with them.   When John's mother is murdered, the aging Hung Chin raises John.  She teaches him Chinese customs and on the day before she dies, they dance their last waltz.  Devastated, John runs to a white woman that befriended him at school, Mrs. Shaw.  Mrs. Shaw nurtures and loves John, and just when John begins to heal, Mrs. Shaw receives notice that her father is dying and that she must leave Jamaica and return to Chicago.  Before Mrs. Shaw leaves however,  she secures a place for her beloved John to live with Dr. and Mrs. Meitner until she returns.   Without warning, John is forced to leave Jamaica and go to London with the Meitners who are involved in the Jewish movement in Europe.  The Meitners are good to John and provide him with a quality education, but John's heart aches for the life he once knew.  Even though John becomes an accomplished journalist and his life in England is good, Madam Chin, Mrs. Shaw and a land called Jamaica holds his heart.<BR> <BR>I found this book to be a beautiful piece of literary art.  Richly written, Dyer takes the reader on a historical trip through World War I and the Holocaust.  She eases the reader from one cultural experience to the next with ease and grace.  With each page the reader is captivated by a boy who fights the odds, becomes a man and dances his last waltz to the tune of victory.

Throughout the book the women find themselves involved in sexcapades, betrayal, deceit and murder.  Ultimately, the woman find themselves leaning on each other for the love and support that only a true friend can provide.<br />I found this book to be slightly amusing at best.  The author wrote this book in a \\"girlfriend\\" tone and often used such words as \\"nigga\\" to describe African American men.  The main character, Candice, reminded the reader of how \\"fine\\" she was continuously and after the first few chapters her character became about as predictable as a monkey eating a bucket of bananas that has been placed in front of him.  Additionally, the author tackled such subjects as murder and homosexuality with a certain carelessness.  In the story she suggests homosexuality can be forgotten with the love of a good woman and that a woman who kills the man that she loves can forget all about it and live \\"happily ever after.\\"<br />Despite the repetitiveness, lack of plot and character development, this author has a lot of raw talent.  In time, Sanders could become an excellent writer.<br />T RHYTHM KNIGHT<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-12-21

When the stranger calls in the favor by asking Blades to help his beautiful friend Precious locate her father, Blades reluctantly agrees.  A few days later, Blades discovers himself being named as  the  prime suspect in two murders. Having no place to hide, Blades must disappear on the streets of Brooklyn while trying to find the clues that will ultimately clear his name.  As Blades uncovers each layer of corruption,  he finds himself at the doorstep of the FBI,  City Hall, and ultimately The New York Police Department.<br />Too Beautiful To Die is packed with suspense.  From the beginning to the end I found this to be a page turner.  Admittedly, this book is little on the macho side, but not overly so.  The female audience should not be disappointed.  Lovell, has a flair for creating believable characters and the ability to make the reader feel as if they are right in the middle of the action.

To the world they appear happy and well-adjusted, but the Brunson children are painfully aware that appearances are not always what they seem.   Each day they must smile behind tears as they are told how stupid, useless and ugly they are.  Each day they must endure endless beatings as they go behind closed doors in their father's house.<br />While I found this story to be compelling, I did not find it any different from any other story that I have read on the subject.  I commend Ms. Johnson for bringing this story to fruition, but the plot and character development left a little to be desired.  The stories of each child's abuse was somewhat repetitive and thus became predictable by the end. Despite the repetitiveness, I found the author's writing style to be commendable.  I definitely look forward to reading more of her work in the future.  <br />If you are, or know someone that has been a victim of child abuse, this may be a good read. <br />T.

They are movie stars, musicians, CEOs, single fathers, bus drivers and teachers. Each story covers subject matter such as: Growing up without a father in the home, mental illness, love, health, finances and sexual orientation (to name a few).  <br />Every now and then you read a book which blows your mind.  Souls of My Brothers happened to be that book for me.  From the foreword, by Isaac Hayes, to the last essay, I was captivated.  At times I cried, I laughed, and by the end, I was empowered to become a better person.  One of the most powerful sections in the book was the section which deals with being the keeper of one's brother.   In this section, individuals shared stories on how they became successful when faced with insurmountable odds and how they reached back and developed programs, centers, jobs, etc. to assist their brothers.  <br />Armed only with a keyboard or a pen, each essayist shot powerful words on paper.  Their words were loaded with the insight of a race of men that has been silent far too long.  If you have ever wondered why an African American man reacts a certain way when  placed in certain circumstances, I suggest you read this book.  Although this book does not serve as a blueprint into the African American man's psyche, it can be used as a tool towards understanding him.   <br />If you are looking for that perfect Christmas or birthday gift, I suggest you give a copy of Souls of My Brothers, to the brothers in your life. <br />T.

There were many twists and turns on this roller-coaster.  Dixon laid a strong plot with murder, sex, and mystery to pull it forward.  Each character was developed well and was believable.

Add murder, lies and deceit to the plot and you have a delightfully exciting story.<br />Walter Mosley did not disappoint.  I found this book to be exciting and outfitted with several unexpected turns of events throughout the plot.  I did, however, find Paris' personality a bit distracting.  For instance, Paris consistently referred to himself as a coward, yet he knowingly jumped head first into danger throughout the book.  Although this proved a bit distracting, it was not overly so.

While traveling on the fast track of  success, he looks up only to find himself derailed by the beautiful, sophisticated and older Sharifa Giovanni.  From the onset Mama knew best.  She tried to warn Xavier that Sharifa was not the woman for him, but it was too late.  Xavier was madly in love. True to Mama's prediction,  it did not take long for the beautiful Sharifa to leave Xavier for greener pastures.  Devastated and unable to cope,  Xavier turns to a life of drugs and crime.  Seven years and a prison sentence later, Xavier is  married and the pastor of a flourishing ministry.  When Sharifa returns, Xavier must decide if he will choose the woman that God says he needs or the woman that he knows he wants.<br />In Whirlwind in the Wilderness, Paul White does an awesome job of depicting the consequences of our actions when we refuse to let God have his way.  This book is a powerful testimony to God's power, love and mercy.  Although I found the storyline to be excellent and the characters credible, I felt the writing could have been tighter.  For instance, the beginning of the story starts out with an interview  but the interview is not mentioned again until the end of the book.  This  makes it almost impossible for the reader to remember what was taking place.  In addition, there were occassional voice shifts and the book ended with a surprise  that was abrupt and without much development.  Although there were a few flaws in the writing, I feel as if this debut novel by Paul White was an excellent read.  I recommend this book to anyone that has not learned to let God have His way in their life.  This is one of the few books that I will always remember, as it serves as a reminder that God knows what is best.  I look forward to reading more from this author in the future, as his knowledge of God's word shines forth.

It does not take long for the good doctor to add Maryann to his list of conquests and for Maryann to become caught up in the prestige of being a doctor's lady.

Can the good doctor convince Maryann that he really cares about her?  You will have to see for yourself in Linda Stallworth's novel, Betray Me Not.<br />While the storyline was good, I found the characters to be a little less credible.  For instance, the doctor goes through great lengths to cover up his lies on one end, only to be extremely careless on the other.  In addition, the entire story is told by the author in the beginning, giving very little reason for the reader to read the book, especially since there were no surprises.  While reading the book I often found the author telling me what was about to happen instead of letting me experience it through the eyes of the characters.  Had I been shown the story instead of told it, I would have enjoyed it better.  Stallworth is a gifted storyteller and I look forward to hearing from her in the future.  I am eager to see how bright her star shines in the sequel to this thriller.  If you are looking for an entertaining and short read, betray yourself not and get a copy of this book.<br />T.

Armed with a bottle of Jack Daniels in one hand and the phone in the other, she tries to find someone to listen to her latest web of woe.  Diligently, she tries to find someone to call, only to realize there is nobody who really cares.  Not even her once best friend Grace.

Ashamed of her actions, she finds the courage to call Grace and apologize. Unfortunately, the apology only serves to resurrect past hurts for Grace. Rather than deal with Jana, Grace hangs up and makes an attempt to ignore the pain. Although she tries, she finds it impossible; something keeps eating at her spirit.  Realizing the need for forgiveness and the inability to do it on her own, Grace turns to God.  The result is a powerful testimony of God's grace and mercy in the lives of these two friends.<br />I found this book to be an enjoyable and spiritually uplifting read.  Healing the Breach shows the power of forgiveness and love, through each woman's point of view.  Admittedly, this book started off a little slow, as the author did more telling than showing. But, I soon realized this book was not about finesse, dialogue, and the here and now.  Rather, it was about the power of God's word when applied to one's life.  For anyone that has ever experienced pain and betrayal and cannot find the means to forgive, I suggest they heal the breach.<br />T. Rhythm Knight<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-07-04
