I especially love to read books written by people who were there, or in this case a person who was greatly effected by the events described.  I picked this book up on a whim from a book store and the writing style dragged me into the story.  It is truly unique in that it is written by the brother of a Marine that died in Vietnam and that it really does not focus too much on the war.  It does cover the basics of that era, but more focuses on the effects the war had back home, as well as the lasting effects on his family. <br /> <br />I am glad that Mr. Smith finally found a start to his healing and was able to write this book to share with the public.	2005-08-28

The characters were well developed and the plot well paced.  There were a few technical things, character name mix-ups (i.e. Garrett named in place of Gordon), and a few odd Chinese phrases (though it could have been Cantonese he was using instead of Mandarin).  These little things did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the book. <br /> <br />I find Riker's take on the Taiwan issue interesting; though it might have been just for the plots sake that he presented it the way he did.  It's an interesting scenario for the future.	2004-10-03

US	49019613	RHATVO4W2A1OL	0312986750	836188292	When Duty Whispers Low	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Improvement over the Second Book of the series	I finally decided to give this series another try after getting bored with the second book a couple years ago.  This book is well written and well paced.  The action is realistic and the characterization of the main cast is consistant.  However, there was one noticeable error.  At about half-way through this book the USS Pelican (Ingram's minesweeper in Book 1) becomes the USS Penguin.  The other thing that bugged me about this book is that Ingram keeps getting his ships shot out from under him.  Is he jinxed?  Does he just have the worst luck in the Navy?  Since his ships keep getting sunk or heavily damaged, why does the Navy keep promoting/rewarding him?  But that is just a minor nitpick on my part.  Otherwise, this is one of the better series of Navy fiction that I've read.	2004-06-07

I enjoyed the first book of the series.  The second book of the series is even better and moves at a better pace than the first one did.  I enjoy his characterizations and descriptions.  He writes just the right amount to give a clear picture without becoming tedious.<br />Personally, I want to see more from Jess Tamblyn's POV but I'm not the author so I'll just have to like what I get.  :)<br />Very original plot and creation of tension between races!

Especially for the Pacific Theater.  Yes, it's honest about horrors commited by both sides - before, durring and after WWII.  So it's not for those who wish to believe that the enemies of the USA were the only ones to commit horrible war crimes.  I'm glad that the author has included input from people who were actually there.  Both Japanese and American.  The history of Japan presented in this book is interesting and explains well the state of mind of Japan's government of WWII.  I'm sad to hear of how those on Chichi Jima died, but I'm glad to finally have found out.  Great read.	2004-01-19

This is my favorite military history book!  And the only submarine book that I can read from cover to cover.  I've tried others but they just don't seem as captivating.  I first read this book in 1996 and I've read it at least 8 times since then.  I'm amazed by the story telling ability of Admiral Fluckey.  The story is exciting but still conveys the dangers of being in a sub, especially during wartime.  And Admiral Fluckey seems to be a truly modest man because instead of making a big deal out of his own achievments, he makes a simple statement of the crew's achievements.  He writes well and the story definitely keeps a readers attention.  A must read for everyone.<br />I hope that someone does make a movie out of this book!  It would make an awesome movie!	2004-01-19

One of the obvious mistakes is the change in name of Dave Coffer to Paul Coffer.  The other mistake that I can think of is in the beginning when Gunn's team is being picked up by the sub.  12 knots is not a slow speed, once can water ski at 12 knots.  Maybe Mr. Riker meant 1 knot or 2 knots but mistyped.  Otherwise, I liked this book.  I like how we got to see more of the Vietnamese characters in this book and learn more of what drove some of them to fight.	2003-10-29

She is not.  She never had a child of her own.  She was the wife of Mace's Uncle.  Mace's Uncle, former chief of Clan Blackhail, was killed at the same time that Raif's father was killed on that hunting party.  Raif's mother died when Raif was 8 or 9 according to \\"Cavern of Black Ice\\" giving birth to Effie.  Raina married Mace in order to keep the clan from coming totally under Mace's control.	2003-10-18

I also don't understand the difference in time between when it was published in the UK and when it was published here in the States.  There doesn't appear to be a difference in the content, just the cover art.    I believe that the story itself is actually better than the story in Cavern of Black Ice.  It flows more easily and brings the reader into the story more.  The descriptions are awesome and so very vivid.  Ms. Jones has done a wonderful job with this series (improving, IMHO, since the Book of Words trilogy).  The characters are very well created yet again.  The storylines were all so intriguing that I finished the book in less than 24 hours.  Again, I hope the next book is out for sale in the States soon because I really don't want to pay over $20 for the British version again.  (though the cover on that one is awesome as well!)    A great book and a good read for any scifi/fantasy fan!	2003-09-23

The scenes seemed to flow smoother than in the first one.  However, certain characters keep getting on my nerves (Spinner and Alyline most of all).  Yet, that's a sign of excellent characterization on the author's part.<br />So overall, the author did a wonderful job with book 2!	2003-03-10

The book was interesting for the first part but then it got kind of repetitive in the sense that every other segment was about Verity thinking about his daughter but not really saying what he was thinking. Also I'm wondering what were the sources Brady used when writing this historical fiction? I didn't see a bibliography at the end, did I miss or was there not one?

The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 stars was because in another book either Owen was quoted on some of the things he did and said that differ from those same things done and said in this book.

It keeps jumping back and forth suddenly and with no warning from the war scenes to memory scenes to scenes in Japan. It's probably more real this way but hard to follow for the average reader. But for anybody who is interested in the Korean War this book is worth reading and sticking through the confusing parts.	2001-08-24

These are really good stories and I'm glad that I finally decided to try reading them even though I don't normally read this kind of SciFi/Fantasy.

I really wanted to give it 4.5 stars but they don't offer that choice!  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that either I missed the re-organization of Third Platoon Lima Company or the authors forgot to let the readers in on it!  In book 5 it's Pasquin, Dean, and Godenov (spelling?) in the same fire-team.  While Kerr, Claypoole, and MacIllargie are in another one.

I think though there should have been a glossary or something in the back of the book for all the Vietnamese words he used!  I couldn't keep them straight.

He also clearly  showed what would happen to snippers if they weren't patient (which he  wasn't on more than one occaision).  I liked how the author wasn't afraid  to tell of his own mistakes and the mistakes of his buddies.  It is sad  that the Vietnam Vets weren't treated the way they should have been: with  respect and love (like the WWII Vets).  I think that this should be  required reading for US history students in high school.  So the language  is a little crude, everybody knows those words by then.  :)	2000-08-13
