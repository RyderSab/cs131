Petersen deftly cuts through the hyperbole surrounding the hunting debate and presents fascinating insights into the subject, often backed by personal experiences.  Must reading for anyone involved in (or for that matter against) hunting.	2004-03-09

I purchased this book based largely on the strength of the reviews below. If anything, they understate the the quality of the writing and stories contained in the book. I found stories to be compelling and the writing superb. If you enjoy truly great writing and short stories you will not want to pass this book up. I am amazed that this collection has not recieved more attention or acclaim. (By the way, I agree with Francis' observation in her review that the \\"expert\\" reviewer who opined that Gay's characters are undeveloped obviously didn't actually read the book).	2003-09-26

It details the life and times of the famous Shawnee war chief in a compelling and realistic fashion. The descriptions of the native American way of life, spirituality and bloody battles with the encroaching white man are riviting.  This is an epic that I found impossible to put down.  This was my first Thom book--I intend to read all of his work. A truly great book.	2003-05-30

Both books, moreover, are substantially shorter than most of Blake's prior outstanding works. I hope this does not mean that we can look forward to Blake cranking out short, mediocre,and formulaic books in the future in order to cash in on his reader's loyalty (ala Larry McMurtry). Nevertheless, if you like Blake (and there is very much to like) you will undoubtedly enjoy this book.	2003-04-18

I found the stories boring (when comprehensible), moralistic and wholly uninteresting. Perhaps I failed to comprehend some oblique deeper mmeaning here--but I doubt it. It was literally a struggle to finish the book. I would definitely skip this one. The worst book I have read in a long time.	2003-03-16

I had heard alot about this book for years and finally got around to reading it. If you enjoy high quality adventure and hunting writing, it truly does not come better than this.  <BR>Ruark takes the reader along on his (and his wife's) first African safari and makes us feel the sights, sounds, smells, adventure, boredoom, fatigue, terror etc. that he experiences as if we were there. His writing is at times witty and always interesting. A fascinating portrait of an era long gone. A great read.	2003-03-13

A true story that you will not be able to put down.	2003-03-12

His writing , moreover , seemed disjointed and strained. I had trouble finishing this rather short book--which is very unusual for me. I initially thought perhaps it is just me, but having read the reviews of Hannah's subsequent, Yonder Stands Your Orphan I see that other readers apparently share my view of Hannah's writing. Skip this one and read Larry Brown's outstanding Facing the Music instead.	2003-02-19
US	50187310	R1HQEJHUHLC7VG	1573222232	201509004	The Fruit of Stone	Books	2	6	11	N	N	Disappointing	I found this book to be well written. The plot, however, left much to be desired. It centers around a man and his friend's search for the man's wife in response to goofy, ridiculously self-absorbed letters left by the wife (for some unexplained reason) at various post offices throughout the west. What occurs during the search is even less realistic. Moreover, we are told very little about the wife who we are to accept as some sort of  modern day Helen of Troy. All in all I found the substance of the story silly. This was disappointing because Spragg's writing at times is excellent. For beautiful writing about the American West in a highly realistic context, try James Galvin's far superior The Meadow.	2003-02-19

Most effective are Groom's descriptions of what the soldiers in the trenches experienced. Strategies are described in plenty of detail without bogging things down with overwhelming detail.  Finally, the maps are excellent--demonstrating clearly what is described in the text (why does this seem to be so difficult for most writers of military history). I highly recommend this book.	2003-02-19
