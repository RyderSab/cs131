US	49190224	R2RXSPLSC0X53D	1411622987	44428683	Atlanta Nights	Books	4	48	53	N	N	A book for writers, that every writer should read	Between the badly written prose and more sex scenes than an Andrew Greeley novel, this is not a book I recommend to my usual audience of family orientated Catholics.  In fact, I don't recommend this book to any child, casual reader, or individual just learning to master the English language.    So why the four star rating? Well, I often find myself reviewing, critiquing or editing the work of aspiring Catholic writers.  I've come across my share of mistakes and wooden prose while doing so, and this book recreates all of it.      The authors of this book are some of the best sci-fi and fantasy writers in the industry.  Their objective was to write the worst book possible, and submit it to PublishAmerica -- a controversial publisher that claims to be a traditional publisher, but which many in the writing industry consider a vanity press.     Atlanta Nights is an example of how one should not write a book  It is also an example of why one should never take shortcuts in life, and why one should always remain vigilant in researching the market before submitting one's work or signing a contract.  In short, Atlanta Nights is a book that never should have been accepted for publication -- which was the point of the whole exercise that led to its creation.	2005-02-25

In this book the author calls for a restoration of Catholic Tradition within the life of the Church, the restoration of Christ's Kingship within Western society, and the restoration of Christian principles within Western culture.  Since its initial publication almost twenty years ago, this book has served as both the inspiration and the blue-print for Traditional Catholic action in France.<br /><br />About the Author and Translators<br /><br />Dom G&eacute;rard Calvet, O.S.B. is the founding Abbot of Ste. Madeleine de Le Barroux Benedictine Monastery.  Owing to a special indult from Pope John Paul II, this monastery prays the liturgy according to the traditional monastic usage of the 1962 Roman Missal.<br /><br />Raymond L&eacute;vesque recently retired after thirty years as a Catholic teacher, during which he taught English and French at a high-school level.

It makes a wonderful canon law primer for non-canonists, since it touches upon all the major areas where a pastoral minister will run into canon law in his day-to-day ministry.  It is particularly strong with regards to the administration of the sacraments.  For example, it lists the prerequisites for being a godparent, when a dispensation or special permission is needed for a wedding, and what to look for canonically when a non-Catholic desires to convert to the Catholic Faith.  The book follows a simple format that is easy to read and easy to find what you're looking for.   <br /> <br />It also makes a wonderful lecture and course outline for canon lawyers looking to teach a basic canon law course to pastoral ministers within one's diocese.  I definitely could have used it, rather than invent my lecture outline from scratch, when in my former diocese I was teaching canon law to permanent deacons and candidates to the permanent diaconate.	2004-12-28

This is just common sense.  It is not exclusively Southern values, it's American values. <br /> <br />Yet why is Zell Miller the only high-profile Democrat who understands this?  And even if the rest of the Democratic leadership do not, why, as the Senator asks, are they so intollerant of the great majority of their traditional constitutency that does? <br /> <br />As Senator Zell warned, and as the last election shows, until the Democrat Party starts respecting the average American and the values held by working class Americans -- which are not the values of Hollywood hedonism or Long Island Limousine Liberals -- the Democratics will be condemned to America's opposition party.	2004-12-11

I'm normally not a fan of the short story, especially when it comes to the adolescent light horror genre.  I thought I would give this book a try, however, since the author is one of my favorites.  He did not disappoint. <br /> <br />While the setting for most of the stories is modern, each of these is told in the tradition of the old folk tales.  In other words, it is not just stories for the sake of chills, but rather each story has its own moral to share. <br /> <br />My favorite among the stories concerns the graffiti artist who decides to deface a museum that happens to be hosting a visiting display from Egypt.  You can pretty much guess who the characters are gonna be, however, Jacques brings a fresh twist to the story that I wasn't expecting. <br /> <br />Another great story concerns the thugish kid who, on a dare, visits the local graveyard at midnight.  Again, while the concept is old, Jacques manages to bring a new twist to the story.  There are several other good stories. <br /> <br />I recommend this book as great for campfires in the summer, or sitting around the fireplace during the winter.  And, as usual with Jacques, he keeps things clean so each of these stories can be told in the family, church groups, scout outings, and other organized youth activities.	2004-12-09

After reading the debate taking place between the other reviewers, I thought I would share my own feelings as a canon lawyer.  Coincidentally, I happen to be friends with some of the reviewers on each side.  This sorta summarizes how I feel about this commentary.   <br /> <br />Overall, I find it quite useful.  Its biggest strength, in my opinion, is the commentary on General Norms, which is the first book of the Code.  (For non-canonists, the Code of Canon Law is divided into seven books -- aka major divisions)  General Norms are the basic canonical principles that define key terms and determine how the law should be applied.  While many find it the most boring book in the Code, it is nevertheless the most important.  Thus it is essential to any any good commentary on the Code that its commentary on General Norms be solid.  The commentary in this book is stellar and I consult it regularly.    <br /> <br />Nevertheless, as others have noted, there are certain parts in this commentary, mainly in the book covering the Sacraments, that I would either question or disagree with.  I would not say that any of the commentary is erroneous, but it does push the envelope on occasion.   <br /> <br />But overall, it's a good resource and the commentary on General Norms, which is very readable without compromising depth, alone is worth the price.	2004-12-09

To explain, a number of people in our class were assigned this book several years ago when I was in high-school.  Being a conservative evangelical Protestant at the time, I found the book both absurd and offensive to my Christian sensibilities.  This is no longer the case. <br /> <br />While I am still a conservative, albeit a Catholic now, the recent push in Canada and the United States among certain fundamentalist branches of Protestantism, Mormonism and Islam to legalize polygamy makes this book frightingly possible.  Should anyone doubt this -- regardless of whether that individual be a liberal or a conservative -- I suggest he or she read this book alongside Andrea Moore-Emmett's \\"God's Brothel\\".   <br /> <br />The subtitle of this latter work could very well be the sub-title of \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\", namely, \\"The extortion of sex for salvation in contemporary Mormon and Christian fundamentalist polygamy and the stories of 18 women who escaped.\\" <br />While Attwood's book is a work of fiction, the similarities between it and what Moore-Emmett has documented with regards to the mistreatment of women in fundamentalist-style polygamous societies are chilling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-07

I'm a canon lawyer, meaning I work within the Catholic Church's internal legal system. So a good commentary is essential. <br /> <br />Of all the commentaries on the Code of Canon Law available in the English language, this one remains my favorite. It is a wonderful translation of the University of Navarre's annotated commentary, using the British translation of the Code into English. What is also neat is the Latin parrallel text which allows canonists to see what word is being employed when in doubt. This is important to avoid confusion, since there are two words for law in Latin -- each with a subtlely different meaning -- so it is important to know which one is being used. <br /> <br />This volume also contains other important texts to canonists that are not available in the other commentaries, texts such as Pope John Paul II's Pastor Bonus through which the Holy Father reorganized the Roman Curia, as well as complimentary legislation specific to a number of English speaking countries. So you're getting more than just a code and commentary with this little volume. <br /> <br />This commentary is also very portable, compared to the other English language commentaries, as in it fits in a briefcase or laptop computer bag. However, this makes for small print with regards to the commentary part, which is the one drawback.  <br /> <br />If you are a canonist or someone interested in canon law, this work is essential if your primary language of communication is English. In fact, I've gone through a number of copies since I keep one at the office, one at home, one at my parents' home, and one in French. I consult it at least daily, either in my work as a canonist or in my work as a Catholic writer.	2004-12-07

We Canadian authors really need to learn how to write books the rest of the world wants to read.  <br /> <br />Ms. McCurdy has the potential to write such books. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying this story. While one would never mistake Ms McCurdy at this stage of her career for a JK Rowling, a Darren Shan or a Brian Jacques, as a new author she keeps up with the middle of the pack when it comes to international writers of children's fantasy.  <br /> <br />With this in mind, I will start with the negative and then note the positive.  As the previous reviewer notes, this story contains nothing new or original in terms of children's fantasy. The ideas are for the most part rehashed from elsewhere. The one unique thing about the story is that it begins in Ottawa, and this works to get the story off the ground.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, once the adventure story gets going, the repeated references to Ottawa grow stale. Whereas an American or a British author would say the heroine missed her \\"friends from back home,\\" McCurdy feels compelled to say \\"from Ottawa\\".  This seems rather forced to give the book some Canadian content.   McCurdy should just drop the references and let the story take its course. Like McCurdy, I'm a fiction writer from Ottawa with a law degree, so I can identify with the heroine and her friends when she \\"misses Ottawa\\".  But what about potential readers from Calgary, London, Washington, or Tucson Arizona?  On another side note, I found the monsters can be somewhat cartoonish in terms of their names.  <br /> <br />In terms of the positive, McCurdy is a competent story-teller. A little heavy on the descriptive tags at certain points, but normally she keeps the book moving at a brisk pace. She also avoids the temptation, too often present in Canadian children's fiction, to sermonize. While the book is Good vs. Evil, she allows the story to unfold rather than engage in preaching. Finally, while keeping within the bounds of good taste appropriate to children's literature, McCurdy also does not shy away from physical confrontation between Good and Evil, thus avoiding another weakness within Canadian children's fiction.	2004-12-07

Over the years, I have sometimes disagreed with the author when it comes to canon law.  But not over anything she has written or edited in this book.  Of the numerous annulment question and answer books out there, Sister Victoria's is my favorite.<br /><br />This book is readable, informative, interesting and completely faithful to Church teaching.  What makes this book unique is that Sister answers real questions asked by real people either going through the annulment process or those thinking of doing so.  Additionally, Sister isn't scared to branch out and answer some good questions about what makes for stronger marriages and what weakens marriage.  She also adds a personal touch by sharing how God worked His grace is the marriage of her parents.<br /><br />In the end, it makes for a fun book, insofar as something as painful as an annulment or a broken marriage can be fun.  My only complaint is that Sister Victoria doesn't spend more time marketting the book, since this hidden gem is truly among the best Q&A books on annulments.	2004-12-07

With biting wit and politically incorrect sarcasm, Ann Coulter cuts to the chase and, strangely enough, defends working class-values against Democrats.   <br /> <br />Here's just a sample of the chapter titles and sub-titles: <br /> <br />\\"Even with Hindsight Liberals Can't See Straight\\" <br />\\"At Least They Didn't Run Jimmy Carter This Time\\" <br />\\"Barbra Streisand Feels Your Pain (According to Her Publicist)\\" <br />\\"Checks and Balances, bu Mostly Checks\\" <br />\\"Give Us Twenty-two Minutes, We'll Give Up the Country\\" <br />\\"The Only Cop the New York Times Likes Is the One in the Village People\\" <br />\\"Elian Gonzalez: The Only Immigrant Liberals Ever Wanted to Deport\\" <br /> <br />If Democrats in Blue States want to understand why Bush won re-election, they ought to read this book (since they refuse to take Zel Miller's to heart).	2004-12-07

(v. 2)	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Apologetics Meets Innovation	When Pat Madrid brought together &quot;Surprised By Truth&quot; he innovated the Catholic apologetics movement by bringing together the stories of various converts to Catholicism from Protestantism.  That first book revolutionized the Catholic Apologetics world and sparked many immitations.<br />Yet few can immitate Pat Madrid except Pat himself.  This is proven in &quot;Surprised By Truth II,&quot; in which Madrid once again demonstrates why he is a leading Catholic apologist in North America.  This book goes beyond the scope of the first book, bringing together the stories of converts from non-Christian religions, reverts who left the Church and came back, as well as people who re-ignited their Catholic faith after falling away for a time to follow secularism and the ways of the world.  As such, it reaches a wider audience than Pat's first book, asking questions which trouble modern man.<br />I highly recommend this work, which can be read in short sittings and which will challenge even the most mediocre Catholic to rethink their faith.	2001-12-29
US	49190224	R1CRIQ45V3QU40	0921440154	701777009	The Gospel Without Compromise	Books	5	6	6	N	N	LITERALLY	When Catherine de Huek Doherty, the exiled Russian Baroness turned Canadian Mother Theresa speaks about the Gospel without compromise, she means it literally.  There is no compromise with Catherine when it comes to submitting oneself to Christ and serving him through the poor while deepening one's life of prayer in humble obedience to the Church.  Okay, that last sentence was a handful; but so is this book.<br />In this work, Catherine calls us first to prayer, secondly to submission to our legitimate Church authority, and thirdly to serve the poor.  In so doing, we live the Gospel without compromise.  As she broadens these themes, Catherine's Russian background combines with her experience serving the poor in North American inner cities as well as her silent spiritual retreats in the Canadian wilderness to provide the reader with fresh insight into the spiritual life.  From this, a theme of servitude emerges, in which we serve both God and our fellow man out of love of the cross.<br />I strongly recommend this book.	2001-12-29

This book left my family and I breathless with regards to its noble simplicity, spiritual depth and excellent story-telling.  It is truly one of Catherine's classics.  This book is divided into three parts, each of them equally soulwarming, all of which build upon Christ's usage of the parable to teach a spiritual truth.<br />The first part retells a number of Russian spiritual parable Catherine remembers from her youth before the Communist revolution forced her from her home.<br />The second part is series of tales recounting God's providence and men's conversion during the the Great Depression era when Catherine ran Friendship House in the inner cities to feed (both physically and spiritually) the poor and homeless.  From the touching story of a young couple with a baby who showed up homeless like the Holy Family on Catherine's doorstep Christ Mass Eve to the atheist who, after God answered his challenge, discerned a vocation to priesthood -- the reader is left spiritually inspired.<br />The third part is a series of parables dealing with Christian virtue which Catherine wrote to assist a holy Trappist monk who was recuperating at Madonna House after suffering a series of severe seizures.<br />All are heartwarming stories which can be shared with the family.	2001-12-29

For this reason, it presents a valuable resource not only Eastern Catholic canonists, but Latin Catholic canonists as well, as increasingly the Church is seeing many crossover issues that affect both Eastern and Latin Catholics.  Thus it is important that the canonist have a good understanding of Eastern Canon Law, since both sets of law must be respected.<br />The author is one of the most respected Eastern canonists in the English-speaking world, and thus his complete commentary proves helpful in that it is easy to read, the history behind the canon is explained, and one is given an Eastern sense of the canon being commentated upon.  My only complaint was that the actual canons themselves were not included, and thus I strong suggest one also pick up a copy of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches upon which this commentary is based.	2001-12-09

In my opinion, this commentary is a success for these reasons.<br />As a canonist who does freelance writing on the side for a variety of popular Catholic publications, and who often finds himself teaching canon law to non-canonists, this is the commentary I most often cite when doing so.  Again, because it is orthodox, pastoral and written at a level most Catholics can understand.  Its larger print layout only facilitates the ease with which one reads it.  For those seeking a commentary for reference purposes, this is the way to go.  It is very much like the family Bible one keeps on one's bookshelf.	2001-12-02

He graciously gave me an autographed copy.<br />I put it to use, and found it wonderful. The texts the author uses to teach Latin are the Church's basic prayers such as the Pater Noster (Our Father), Ave Maria (Hail Mary), and the Credo (Apostle's Creed as well as Nicean Creed).  From these prayers, the author teaches Latin grammar, syntax, vocabulary and declenchants.<br />I found it immensely useful, as well as a practical, especially for those who are looking to learn ecclesiastical (as opposed to classical) Latin.	2001-12-02

I originally read this book as a Catholic who had left the Church to join a Pentecostal assembley.  This is the book which brought me back into the Catholic Church.  Scott and his wife Kimberly provide a compelling testimony as to how they came to discover the truths of the Catholic Church.<br />At the time, Scott was finishing his theological studies as a Reformed Presbyterian minister.  Kimberly came from a lineage of well-known Presbyterian ministers.  They were not your usual candidates for Catholic conversion.<br />Nevertheless, Scott came across a couple old Catholic theology books and began reading them with interest.  As he read, he began to struggle with certain theological questions pertaining to Catholicism.  Initially, Kimberly was not impressed by the direction she saw her husband going, and Scott's theological quest took a personal turn.<br />One of the nice things about this book is that while it recounts Scott and Kimberly's theological and personal journey into the Catholic Church, they remain both charitable towards and grateful for their Presbyterian background, and thus their journey into Catholicism is not so much a rejection of their Protestant past, but a fulfillment of their Christian love.	2001-12-02

So a good commentary is essential.<br />Of all the commentaries on the Code of Canon Law available in the English language, this one remains my favorite.  It is a wonderful translation of the University of Navarre's annotated commentary, using the British translation of the Code into English.  What is also neat is the Latin parrallel text which allows canonists to see what word is being employed when in doubt.  This is important to avoid confusion, since there are two words for law in Latin -- each with a subtlely different meaning -- so it is important to know which one is being used.<br />This volume also contains other important texts to canonists that are not available in the other commentaries, texts such as Pope John Paul II's Pastor Bonus through which the Holy Father reorganized the Roman Curia, as well as complimentary legislation specific to a number of English speaking countries.  So you're getting more than just a code and commentary with this little volume.<br />This commentary is also very portable, compared to the other English language commentaries, as in it fits in a briefcase or laptop computer bag.  However, this makes for small print with regards to the commentary part, which is the one drawback.  <br />If you are a canonist or someone interested in canon law, this work is essential if your primary language of communication is English.  In fact, I've gone through a number of copies since I keep one at the office, one at home, one at my parents' home, and one in French.  I consult it at least daily, either in my work as a canonist or in my work as a Catholic writer.	2001-12-02

It is also the only one published during his lifetime, and it is considered the greatest work he wrote.  Why?<br />It is concise and insightful.  Bl. Josemaria reaches to root of what troubles us spiritually, and challenges us to conform our life to God's plan for our life.  He also teaches us that every little thing we do in our life -- work, sport, leisure -- can be done well for the greater glory of God, and offered as prayer.<br />This presented an important spiritual awakening for me, since I before reading this book I tended to compartmentalize my prayer life.  What is also unique about this book is that the insights are broken down into short sentences.  The longest insight is no more than two paragraphs.  Thus this book can be carried around with ease, and meditated upon during a spare minute or two during the day.	2001-12-02

For example, all the Byzantine Churches are grouped together, as well as all the Antiochean Churches, Alexandrian Churches, etc...  Don't worry if you don't understand the differences, the author explains it quite well.<br />Each Church is given its own entry, and the author provides a brief overview of its customs, patrimony, liturgy, history and spirituality.  From the Orthodox perspective, all the main branches are covered such as the Greek and Russian Orthodox and those Orthodox Churches in communion with them, the Oriental Orthodox, the Assyrian Church of the East, and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia.  <br />As a Catholic canonist who is often called upon to identify particular Orthodox Churches because of my interest in East-West ecumenism, I find this book an essential resource for my library.	2001-12-02

Most books on St. Thomas Aquinas tend to go deep into St. Thomas' theology.  This book, however, offers a fun biography of the saint, touching upon Aquinas' genius and explaining the controversies in which he engaged.  G.K. Chesterton, ever the gifted story teller, recounts many of the interesting incidents Aquinas faced in his life, answering many of the questions we might have about him.  For example, how did Aquinas, considered the greatest theologian the Catholic Church has ever produced, get the knick-name &quot;the Dumb Ox.&quot;<br />Chesterton knows, and Chesterton tells, holding the reader in suspense as he builds up the story.

At the same time, I found this both to be one of the most enjoyable, and one of the most disturbing, of Stephen King's books.  It is definitely Richard Bachman style over King's usual subtle psychological horror.  The book is also much better than the movie.<br />The events take place in the future, when the television networks have more or less taken over political power.  The economic distinction between classes is much more stark, and the only opportunity for the poor to rise through the socio-economic ranks is to volunteer for life-threatening game shows.<br />The protagonist, a married victim of the old economy who is unable to find suitable employment, is unable to pay for basic medication that would save his infant daughter's life.

This is one of my two favorite books written by Hans Urs von Balthasar.  The Catholic Church asserts that certain individuals are in Heaven, but never declares a specific individual to be in Hell.  In fact, the Church still hopes that in their final moments of life, even the greatest sinners such as Judas Iscariot and Adolph Hitler would have repented of their terrible sins.<br />In this book, Hans Urs von Balthasar pushes the hope that in their final moments of life, all souls will repent and make their peace with God.  He hopes all will be saved, not because all deserve Heaven, but rather because all will come to know the great mercy and forgiveness of Our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />Nevertheless, von Balthasar HOPES for the salvation of all.  He does not maintain all will indeed be saved, but rather this is his hope.  Several times in the work, von Balthasar reminds the reader that Hell remains a very real possibility, and that man must always keep this possibility before his eyes.	2001-12-01

In this series of unrelated, although not necessarily disjointed, short stories, Coupland notes the unresolved existence of my generation.  Namely, what is it about today's generations that separates us from our parents and grandparents.<br />As the stories unfold, Coupland comes to the realization that our generation is the first where God and Church played no visible public role in our lives.  As a result he cannot help but wonder whether this has affected our generation's capacity to love, or to find meaning that goes deeper than materialism.<br />Therefore, at its essence, this book raises some troubling questions about the meaning of life and love.	2001-12-01

This book is not so much for the canonist, but for the non-canonist engaged in pastoral ministry.  It teaches the basics of canon law, provides a handy glossary of canonical terms, and tells you when you are facing a canonical situation over your head and need to phone a canonist.<br />In particular, the non-Canonist will find Fr. Huels' treatment of marriage law handy.  It outlines in what situations a dispensation is necessary, as well as in what circumstances a proposed marriage is invalid.  It also provides a handy canonical reference to other common questions that arise around the celebration of the sacraments -- such as who can be a sponsor for baptism and confirmation.<br />I highly recommend this book to non-canonists engaged in pastoral ministry who are seeking a handy reference concerning how canon law applies in common pastoral situations.	2001-12-01

Most of my writing takes place within the context of conservative Catholic commentary or canon law.  Therefore, when I picked up Stephen King's memoirs on the craft, it was mainly due to boredom in the airport as I waited for my flight.  By the time I reached my destination, I had finished it.  This work proves King truly crosses genres when he puts his mind, as well as his pen, to it.  I enjoyed this work tremendously, and found it helpful in my own writing.  There is good advice for all writers here, whether one is breaking out in the craft or a veteran, whether one writes fiction or non-fiction.<br />In the past, I have occasionally dabbled in fiction, but never with much success. Yet following King's advice, my fiction has greatly improved.  For example: at the instigation of my English professors, I tended to over-plot my work.  King advises against plotting, stating a story reads much better when it unfolds as the writer sits at the keyboard.  If the author does not know how the story will end, King speculates, neither is the reader likely to do so either.  This creates suspense.  I tried putting this into practice with my own writing, and found it much more exciting as a result.<br />King offers many other points for improving one's writing, most of which I found both practical and successful.  Therefore, I recommend this book to anyone interested in the craft of writing.	2001-11-29

It touches upon issues of ecclesiology and sacramental theology.  In short, Cardinal Ratzinger ties in the Most Blessed Sacrament, the Holy Eucharist, with the Church.  Through it, he explores God's covenant with His people.  I have long noticed the various double meanings -- one sacramental, the other ecclesiological -- in much of our theological language.  Words like &quot;communion&quot; and &quot;Body of Christ&quot; carry the double significance of our communion with one another, as well as our communion with Christ.

One of the cool things about being a canon lawyer is that I get to hang around with Catholic writers and apologists. I enjoy this blessing because I read a lot of their books, and so the opportunity to sit down with them and talk is always a wonderful experience. Now one of my favorite people is Tim Drake. He's really laid back and always has something interesting to say about his conversion to the Catholic Church. He's also one of the nicest people I've met in the Catholic apologetics movement, and so I was thrilled when he sent me an autographed copy of this book.<br />Now the past decade has brought numerous collections of conversion stories. The typical story usually involves a former Protestant sharing with the reader how Our Lord awakened him to the fullness of Catholic Truth. These collections testify to the fact that, soul by soul, the Holy Spirit is working in the hearts of baptized Christians to restore unity to Christ's Church.  In such a way, I am reminded ofCardinal Ratzinger's exhortation that the Catholic Church does not seek the dissolution of the Lutheran confession, but rather its fulfillment in returning to Catholic unity.<br />This is what makes Tim Drake's collection so unique and compelling. It is the first collection of conversion stories devoted entirely to Catholic converts from the Lutheran tradition. As Tim Drake explains in his introduction, there is something different about being a Lutheran, in that Martin Luther is the father of the Protestant Reformation. This seems quite in keeping with Cardinal Ratzinger's view in the latter's work &quot;The Principles of Catholi Theology&quot; from which I previously paraphrased.  Therefore, I find myself in agreement with Marcus Grodi that this book goes to the heart of the Protestant Reformation.<br />The prospect of Lutherans rediscovering their Catholic heritage is of interest to both Catholics and Protestants alike. On the one hand, it challenges the Protestant to question and re-examine the fundamental tenets of the Protestant Reformation in light of apostolic Tradition. On the other hand, it forces Catholics to more seriously treasure the Church founded by Christ upon the rock of St. Peter. For these and other reasons, this book should be read alongside the Cardinal Ratzinger's aforementioned book.<br />In the end, Tim Drake provides an important contribution to Catholic evangelism in the 21st Century, and I highly recommend this work for this reason.	2001-11-27

In his apostolic exhortation Salvifici Dolores, Pope John Paul II writes: \\"[...] what we express by the word `suffering' seems to be particularly essential to the nature of man. It is as deep as man himself, precisely because it manifests in its own way that depth which is proper to man, and in its own way surpasses it. Suffering seems to belong to man's transcendence: it is one of those points in which man is in a certain sense `destined' to go beyond himself, and he is called to this in a mysterious way.\\" <br />This insight on human suffering is one of my favorite passages from the prolific writings of our current Holy Father.  It is also the theme of Stephen Hand's novella. In fact, human suffering is what makes Gifts Unexpected both so enjoyable and so compelling to the reader; these are real characters who suffer through the modern afflictions of divorce, loneliness, drug and alcohol addiction as well as urban poverty.  Yet through it all, they either find God or remain hopeful in God's salvific promise.  In short, the plot is noble in its simplicity: the temptation to despair strikes, a struggle ensues within the hearts of the main characters, and through the grace of God they persevere until finding solace within God's mysterious love.  Through it all, the experience of suffering unveils a depth in the characters as the reader encounters an elderly hermit priest, a young girl on the verge of adolescence who struggles with her parents' divorce, the girl's alcoholic mother and the father who abandoned her. <br />The story revolves around Evelyn, the young girl mentioned above, and Fr. Joseph, the hermit priest.  The two meet in a cemetery where Evelyn goes to play because her mother is too busy for her, and where Fr. Joseph prays for the souls of the deceased.  Fr. Joseph is a retired priest who has received permission from his bishop to live in the cemetery's abandoned priory.  Recognizing Evelyn's need for a father figure after her father abandoned her, Fr. Joseph takes Evelyn under his spiritual care.  He endeavors to provide Evelyn with some adult guidance and companionship, without judging the dysfunctional family situation from which Evelyn sprung.  In such a way, as Evelyn's mother pursues alcohol and unsatisfying relationships, while Evelyn's father degenerates further into reclusive depression, Fr. Joseph helps Evelyn come of age.<br />Many avid Catholic readers, myself included, have followed Stephen Hand's journalism for some time.  This novella was my first encounter with this Stephen Hand's fiction, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it surpassed even the high standards Stephen exerts in his journalism and editorials.  In reading this work, Stephen's older readers will also find themselves surprised to discover Stephen wrote this novella about a year before he took his famous stand for the Catholic Church against those who feel the Church has sold out since the Second Vatican Council.  For not only is hostility against the present Church almost non-existent, but the principal religious characters remain unshaken in their fidelity to Rome.  In fact, by their example these same characters personify Pope John Paul II's message of redemption through human suffering.  Thus in the chronology of Stephen's writing, this work definitely foreshadows his subsequent total rejection of integrism, as well as his radical return to the Catholic Church in her totality.  In short, even though Stephen wrote this work before Traditional Catholic Reflections came into existence, in terms of fidelity to the Catholic Church and the spiritual embrace of the Pope John Paul II's pontificate, this work represents TCR Stephen Hand at his most insightful.<br />In summing up, the reader will enjoy this wonderful story in which, through the everyday experiences of human characters, the redemptive suffering of God's heavenly grace confronts and vanquishes the spiritual death brought on by sin and evil.	2001-11-23

With the Second Vatican Council's renewal in the Catholic Church has also come a renewed interest in Catholic apologetics and evangelism.  As one who labors in these fields, I know from experience Dave Armstrong is one of the best kept secret of Catholic evangelism. Dave's honesty and sincerity has brought numerous people into the Catholic Church, and his work has been featured in The Catholic Answer, Envoy, and This Rock - the three staples of Catholic apologetics in North America.  He is one of many former Protestant evangelists who have come into the Catholic Church over the past decade, yet he is different in that he never found himself hating the Catholic Church.  \\"I always regarded Catholics as brothers in Christ,\\" Dave recently stated in an interview, \\"My wife and I even played John Michael Talbot songs at our wedding, six years before my conversion.\\" <br />What is now Dave's first book was originally lengthy explanations of Catholic distinctives intended to bolster his confidence in and understanding of the Catholic Church, so that he could explain himself to his Protestant friends. Those of us who have worked with Dave in the past have long suspected this manuscript exists, but until recently Dave never thought of publishing it.  I am thankful for its publication, however, since it is not only enjoyable and easy to read, but it presents a fresh style of apologetics.  For Dave, the goal is not simply to win an argument, but to win converts.<br />Thus Dave initially sets out to find common ground with the Church's separated brothers and sisters in Christ.  These folks are not treated as opponents, but rather as fellow Christians seeking the full Gospel message preserved by the Catholic Church.  In such way, Dave follows St. Paul's injunction: &quot;I have become all things to all men, that by all means I may save some.&quot;  To Dave, this is all a part of being as charitable as we can in presenting Catholic claims. And Charity is both supremely important andindispensable when engaged in Catholic evangelism. \\"I think people are far more influenced by Charity than by the arguments themselves,\\" Dave instructs the potential evangelist,  \\"People are ultimately convicted and converted by the Holy Spirit and grace. God may use our paltry efforts now and then, but they are always a small part of the large picture. Our greatest influence on a human level is the charity we show. All people respond to love, but they don't all respond to arguments and reasoning.  Separate people from their ideas, and believe the best of them, as Paul tells us to do in 1 Corinthians 13. As St. Francis said: `preach the gospel at all times; if necessary, even using words.\\"<br />To this insight, let me add my own \\"Amen!\\"  I love that particular quotation from St. Francis of Assisi, which is why I also love Dave's book and the refreshing style he brings to Catholic apologetics and evangelism.	2001-11-11
