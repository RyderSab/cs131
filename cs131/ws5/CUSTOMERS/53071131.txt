The argument is coherent, the facts compelling but somehow there seems to be no \\"killer blow\\".<br /><br />Bernstein's thesis is simple.  Long run economic growth and, hence, prosperity requires the coincidence of clear property rights, scientific rationalism, capital markets and fast and efficient transport and communications.  Throughout history, only when these four factors have coincided in time and place has prosperity occurred.  Northern Europe, specifically England, followed by the remainder of northern Europe and the English speaking world in general were first to experience growth and ongoing prosperity.  Since then, growth has spread more widely e.g. east Asia and perhaps China.  There are also obvious failures that fall into two very broad categories, Latin America and other countries that came under the yolk of Spain or Portugal and finally, the real basket cases, sub-Saharan Africa.<br /><br />As soon as any of the above conditions fail, the society fails.  If religious or political zealots take control of an economy and condemn scientific rationalism, prosperity is dented.  Just consider North Korea.  If capital markets fail, recession is inevitable and so on.<br /><br />Bernstein's work is an excellent primer in economic history and the study of growth.  My disappointment is that perhaps I expected something more.	2005-10-08

This was truly one of the great works of modern American fiction from the 1980s.  Who will forget Sherman McCoy, masters of the universe and social X-rays?  Unfortunately, given the grandeur of Bonfire, all his other works will inevitably be compared to this seminal work.  It is in this comparison that \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" fails.<br /><br />The brief synopsis of \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" is that of a young bright but sexually naïve girl from the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina wins a scholarship to Dupont University in Pennsylvania.  She is the pride of family and understandably so.  However, when Charlotte arrives at the campus she is shocked to learn that sex and drinking play such an important part in university life.  She is totally unable to relate to this new environment.  Ultimately, when she loses her virginity to a frat boy who then discards her, life seems to collapse around poor Charlotte.  Her grades fall and she dwells in a mire of depression until rescue arrives.<br /><br />My main criticism of this work is that Wolfe tries so hard to describe present day college life in America but still falls short of the mark.  Surely, the virginity of someone such as Charlotte is more the exception than the rule?  Can anyone really be such a hillbilly girl?  Perhaps so, but it would not be the norm.  Wolfe is a man in his seventies.  Knowledge of modern college life can scarcely be expected.<br /><br />Yet for all my criticisms, Wolfe remains a master story teller.  His imagery is usually excellent.  In this regard, his talent is rare.  The reader can enjoy this new work for its imagery and well described characters but the plot is a mere shadow of Bonfires.	2005-09-19

Any history book exceeding 800 pages falls into this category.  However, do not let the scale of the book deter the reader from gaining an insight to this mad and evil man.<br /><br />In terms of the history of the 20th Century, Hitler is certainly one of that century's more influential characters.  From a political perspective, the \\"pantheon\\" of significance would include Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Hitler.  Note that no democrats get a look in here.  Perhaps the nearest in terms of influence would be Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.  Thus, no history of the last century can be complete without a thorough understanding of Adolf Hitler and his vast and demonic influence.<br /><br />Bullock's work covers Hitler's life in its entirety.  We begin with his birth in 1889 in Austria near the Bavarian border, through his years as a rabble rouser and gutter politician and finish with his last days in the bunker in Berlin with the Red Army literally only a few hundred metres from capturing him.  Yet through all this period, Hitler's core personality is unchanged.  He has a seemingly innate hatred for Jews combined with a belief that Germany was conspired against from the inside when the First World War armistice was signed.  These views lead Hitler to indulge his fantasies that Germany will rise again and that only he is able to lead the nation.  The end, of course, is the absolute defeat of Germany such that a platform is provided for its splitting in two during the cold war.  It also provides the scope for Stalin to impose his wishes upon Eastern Europe.  This piece of modern day imperialism only ended in the final years of last century.<br /><br />To complete a reading Allan Bullock's work is not an easy task.  It is truly an immense and impressive work.  Yet, if the reader perseveres with the task, the reward is that one is left with a clearer picture of the mad man who legacy was death and destruction.  It is the diary of madness succeeding over reason for too long.  The consequences of this \\"success\\" were truly horrible.the diary of madness succeeding over reason for too long.

It is literature at its finest as it still resonates so powerfully today and, I'm sure, will continue to do so in the future.<br /><br />\\"Night\\" covers the experiences of Elie Wiesel during the second world war when, in 1944, he and his family are rounded up as Jews and sent to  Birkenau where he is separated from his mother and sisters before going on to  Auschwitz and Buchenwald with his father.  It is the story of misery heaped upon misery as he fights for survival.  The remainder of his family fall by the wayside as they slowly succumb to indiscriminate brutality.  For Elie, questions about the human condition are raised as he tries to rationalise events.  He eventually concludes that there is no god in such a world.  He resorts to increasingly desperate means to survive.  Self interest and, thus, life are paramount.  All else is irrelevant.<br /><br />This is a book that should be read.  It is a slim volume that can be easily read in one sitting.  It is a book that will leave the reader stunned by the depravity into which some humans can sink when given the opportunity to inflict harm upon others.	2005-07-11

Chatty, anecdotal and thoroughly absorbing are descriptions that come to mind.<br /><br />Li Cunxin was born in rural China in 1961.  The country was being turned upside down by the horrors, stupidities and tyranny of the so called Cultural Revolution.  Through this turmoil, Cunxin led a fairly typical peasant family life until he was 11 years of age when he was plucked from obscurity to attend Madame Mao's ballet school in Beijing.  Suddenly, a wider world beckoned.  He was no longer the frog at the bottom of the well according to one cited Chinese proverb.  He could now see a more distant horizon.<br /><br />Cunxin's world became larger again when, as a young adult, he was given the opportunity to travel to Houston to train with that city's ballet company.  Now he could clearly see that the lies of the Chinese authorities were just that - lies!  A richer freer world existed with infinitely greater artistic freedom.  Cunxin was angry.  He had been betrayed.<br /><br />On a subsequent visit to Houston for further training, Cunxin took the very brave step to defect.  The courage of such a decision is breath taking.  Access to familiar family and friends is suddenly denied.  All this for the sake of freedom!<br /><br />As time progressed, China itself mellowed as Deng Xiaoping gradually changed China from an introverted tyrannical state to something which, if not totally free, was certainly freer than the China of that existed during the 1960s and 1970s.  Family reconciliations ultimately became possible and Cunxin's life became more full.  He eventually married and now lives in Australia with his wife and children.  His journey was long, difficult, but, in the end, rewarding.  The book too has its rewards and deserves to be read by all readers of topical autobiography.	2005-07-01

The movie was just a great ride and the book was too.  The book, however, was darker and more nihilistic.  The humour blacker and landscape even bleaker.<br /><br />The essence of \\"Trainspotting\\" is a series of events revolving around the main character, Mark Renton, and his drug addicted mates.  It is set against the backdrop of Edinburgh and its working class slums where work is resisted and drugs are accepted as part of day to day life.<br /><br />The language of the book is coarse yet plausible.  The jargon and argot of the junkie weaves its way through out the book.  As for the dialogue and grammar, this is the rough brogue of the streets.  At first, this is difficult to grasp but after a few pages, it gradually makes sense and becomes more familiar.  It is like a twentieth century and bastardised version of what Mark Twain was trying to do with Huckleberry Finn.<br /><br />\\"Trainspotting\\" is not a book to be read by the easily shocked or the self-righteous moraliser.  It is a book that confronts our sensibilities as it slowly draws us into another world.  The scenes often make the reader cringe but there is always something within the characters and the settings that acts to mesmerise.  This is a book that acts like a flame to the moth.  Its attraction is over powering.  Take a gulp of air and be truly challenged.  Read the book!	2005-05-27

In particular, the daily life of ordinary people who, in their own way, were not players on the larger stage.  Rather, these people were those folk just going about their life.<br /><br />Any moderately well read student of the 16th century would be familiar with the world of Henry VIII, Elizabeth, Shakespeare, Francis Drake and the Spanish Armada.  Yet how many of these students would be familiar with the gardens, religious beliefs, medicine, fashions and diets of the era?  Yes, many would have a smattering of knowledge but Liza Picard has done a fine job in providing many of these details of life plus a host of others.  Who, for example, would be familiar with such amusements as bull, bear or even lion baiting?  Imagine the spectacle of setting a lion in a pit with a team of dogs for a fight to the finish; unthinkable today but of the greatest sport during Elizabeth's time.<br /><br />Liza Picard's book is an unusual work of history.  She has chosen to deconstruct a different world to that of most historians.  Her focus has been upon the ordinary rather than the glamorous.  Ms Picard has chosen a different road to travel but one that is very fulfilling for the reader.  Elizabeth I was, in my opinion, the most important woman to ever live.  This book goes some of the way to providing background to an extraordinary woman living in an extraordinary age.	2005-05-02

Given that humans naturally seek more, then speculation is a normal part of that process.  Put simply, speculation has always been with us and always will be with us.<br /><br />Edward Chancellor's work, which is sub-titled \\"A History of Financial Speculation\\", covers history from the time of Tulipomania in 17th century Holland to the collapse of the modern Japanese economic bubble and the trade in junk bonds in America.  If the book were to be revised, I am sure that Chancellor could readily cover the bursting of the dot com bubble and the ongoing travails of Japan.<br /><br />In essence, \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" is a history of crowd madness.  That is, an otherwise rational individual will often behave in a different manner when guided by a group.  Such an individual may load up on dot com companies even though the price earnings ratios are screaming sell simply because others a buying and the market is trending upwards.  However, as with all bubbles, there will be a bust.  Bubbles come and go.  When someone claims that \\"this time it's different\\", alarm bells should start to ring.  The individual who can see reason in the crowd is the one who will avoid the inevitable slump.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in financial history.  My only criticism is that Chancellor seems to think that speculation can sometimes be contained.  This is not the case.  Speculation lies at the heart of our modern economy.	2005-04-10

She held together a small Protestant kingdom against the might of various European threats.  The English language survives in Australia, North America and elsewhere due to her resolve.  Also, Protestantism was a subsequent driving force behind the Industrial Revolution.  A world dominated by Spanish Catholicism may have been poorer, more backward and more superstitious than the world we know today.<br /><br />Jane Dunn has done a fine job in outlining the life of this courageous monarch.  However, rather than just discussing a life in chronological order, she compares it with the life of her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots.  Mary, too, was an ambitious woman.  However, Mary was flawed in comparison.  She was vain where Elizabeth was strong and she was impulsive where Elizabeth was careful.  It was inevitable that these two queens would ultimately clash.<br /><br />Let it be clear, Dunn's work is not an easy read.  It is, however, a detailed analysis of the two women.  While she uncovers few new facts of the pair, by using the technique of constantly comparing Elizabeth and Mary, she does shed light on the two personalities.  It is thus clear that Elizabeth would always succeed where Mary would fail.  In the end, it became somewhat inevitable that Elizabeth would have to execute her cousin.  While Mary lived, Elizabeth's throne was always the subject of threat.  Yet with Elizabeth's later death, the irony of Mary's son assuming control of both countries as James I of England is truly ironic.<br /><br />Although this book is sometimes hard going, do not let that thought prevent the reader of history from reading the work.  This is a book that is often revealing and one's efforts will be rewarded.	2005-03-19

Politics, regardless of its location, can be a murky state of affairs.  Jim Mann's \\"Rise of the Vulcans\\" tries to shine a light on some of the murkier elements of contemporary US politics.  His work is an admirable success.<br /><br />It is very clear that the so-called Vulcans ie Rice, Armitage, Wolfowitz, et al have a near messianic zeal.  They will brook no challenge to their collective world view.  And that is a world view that sees a predominant America flexing its muscle whilst pursuing its interests.<br /><br />Mann outlines the backgrounds of the players in some detail.  His does this dispassionately and does not have an obvious axe to grind.  However, the reader is left in no doubt as to competitive nature of the players.  They each have very firmly held beliefs that allow for no shades of grey.<br /><br />As an observer, I am in two minds as to the legitimacy for invading Iraq.  Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator whose rule was evil personified.  I can shed no tears for his demise.  Yet the world is also home to similar tyrants who indisputably hold a threat to the wider world.  North Korea immediately springs to mind.  Should the US invade?  Well, it doesn't seem to be on the agenda.  Also, why did the US and the wider world turn a blind eye to the Rwandan genocide?<br /><br />Regardless of the conundrums above and the contradictions they provide for US foreign policy, Mann's work is good reading for all interested students of modern US history.	2005-02-21

Many novels have the adjective \\"brilliant\\" fixed to their name.  For some this is justified, for others not.  \\"The Day of the Triffids\\" falls into the former category.<br /><br />The essence of John Wyndham's tale is that a massive meteor shower is watched by most of the world's population.  The next day, most of the population wakes to find themselves absolutely blind.  A handful miss the shower for various reasons including the novel's narrator, Bill Masen, who was in hospital having eye surgery.  His eyes are thus bandaged and the glorious shower is missed.  He can count himself very lucky!<br /><br />Coinciding with the shower is the emergence of Triffids; plants that are both extremely poisonous and mobile.  They can actually lift their roots and move to another location.  Triffids plus near universal human blindness puts civilization and the human race in extreme peril.  The modern world disappears as humans revert to barbarism and feudalism.  Several theories are tested as to how the comet shower occurred but no one explanation can be proved.  The threat to humanity, however, is very real.<br /><br />John Wyndham's novel is now more than fifty years old but still reads wonderfully well.  He paints a bleak scenario in which the remaining sighted humans must strive to rebuild a modern world.  It is often a battle between good and evil and the resultant victor is not always clear.  Wyndham was probably using an analogy for a post nuclear holocaust world.  His message is as fresh today as it was during a time of cold war hostility.	2005-01-23

English is the language of business, technology, finance and, perhaps most importantly, the internet.<br /><br />Yet while English has now assumed a paramount position as the world's language, this was not always the case.  After the fall of the Roman Empire there was great doubt as to whether English would even survive.  In this regard, it owes much to the efforts of Alfred the Great who was able to withstand the Danes and find a toehold in which English could flourish.  But having withstood this early treat, English was once again placed in jeopardy following the Norman invasion in 1066.  It was only the fact that the common people were able use it amongst themselves that it sustained the impact of a Francophone ruling class.<br /><br /> The English fight back came with the arrival of bubonic plague.  With so many priests succumbing to the disease, common English language preachers were required to fill the gap.  In so doing, English was given unexpected impetus.<br /><br />What followed was the arrival of Chaucer and then Shakespeare.  English proceeded to snatch words from other languages and, indeed, this has been its strength.  Unlike other languages, French being the best example, it has not been ossified by an overarching academy seeking to dictate rules and words.  English is wonderfully flexible.<br /><br />Melvyn Bragg does a superb job in bringing vitality to the story of English.  It is a language with an exciting history and he tells the story well.  The book is the companion to an eight part television series that is equally magnificent.<br /><br />\\"The Adventure of English\\" is a book that I can highly recommend.  It should be read by anyone interested in knowing how this all powerful language came to its pre-eminent position.	2005-01-17

I might add that he had already read the book before he passed it on to me.  I think he was keen to have someone to talk to about the work.<br /><br />\\"Beowulf\\" is truly a book of the dark ages.  It is believed to have been written somewhere between the years 700 and 1000.  It takes the reader back to a time of dark and sinister forces.  A time where dragons roamed and life had to be defended with force.  It was a time of great danger and great heroics.<br /><br />Although \\"Beowulf\\" is a work that should be read in order to round out the knowledge of an educated person, it is not a work that is an easy or compelling read.  Perhaps this is to be expected given that \\"Beowulf\\" is older than a thousand years and the modern reader is clearly of a different mindset to even the most educated person in a time when the world was only lit by fire.<br /><br />I have little doubt that the works of JRR Tolkien were heavily influenced by \\"Beowulf\\".  This may be sufficient incentive to encourage many modern readers to embrace a work that, although from a very different time, is a pre-cursor to modern English.	2005-01-05

He thought it would be a good follow up to \\"Trainspotting\\" which I watched a few weeks ago.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed \\"Joe\\", it is a very different film to \\"Trainspotting\\".  Whereas the latter could sometimes be surreal and blackly comic, \\"Joe\\" is more a real life gritty drama.<br /><br />Every character is plausible.  Joe, himself, as played by Peter Mullan, is a knock about sort of working class bloke who slowly falls in love with a woman, Sarah, as played by Louise Goddall, who is a middle class health worker.  Although seemingly from different worlds, they gradually warm to each other.  The other character in each of their lives is Liam who is a friend to Joe and a client to Sarah.  It is Liam and the threats are made to him that form the basis of the film's plot.<br /><br />See this film for its gritty realism.  Be prepared, however, to listen carefully.  A Glaswegian accent is often difficult to the untrained ear.	2004-12-29

Irrational interpretations of history and the consequences that follow are put to the sword.  At last, rationality can be seen to offer a challenge to the ignorance that is religion.<br /><br />In many respects, Sam Harris is a courageous man for daring to state the obvious; that is, the emperor has no clothes.  For too long, the bigotry and ignorance of organized religion has been allowed to prosper without challenge.  Why on earth do we accept and \\"respect\\" views of the world that have no rational support when we would dismiss such logic if it were to be put forward in any serious area of science?  Why are we meant to kowtow to blind faith when this faith has such a sordid past?  Remember, it was the clash of Christianity and Islam that gave us the crusades.  It was Christianity that turned a blind eye to the holocaust.  It is Christianity that supports creationism as science and it is Christianity that condemns stem cell research when this may offer real cures to horrible global illnesses.  Finally, it is Islam that supports the killing of innocent people in the name of its religion.  When will all this insanity end?<br /><br />I have little doubt that Sam Harris' book will anger the devout amongst us.  This is inevitable as these people are scared to think and ask questions of their religious masters.  Harris is thus a both a man of courage as much as a spokesman for a greater humanity that religion despises.	2004-12-28

It was the great clash between an elected republican government, despite all its inherent flaws, and fascism.<br /><br />Antony Beevor has compiled a fine history of the events of 1936-39.  He carefully tracks the election of the republican government and then the subsequent coup initiated by Franco.  War followed with all its inevitable carnage until Franco finally captured Madrid and then continued seeking retribution from any remaining government supporters.<br /><br />In many respects, war in Spain was probably unavoidable.  The two sides had divergent views that democracy seemed unable to manage.  Foreign intervention to support the government was virtually non-existent while Franco had the direct and continuing support of both Hitler and Mussolini.  The western democracies simply sat on their hands.  The only support that the republic could muster was the limp assistance offered by Stalin, a man with much blood on his hands.  Spain was thus trapped in slowly heating cauldron with no escape.<br /><br />Beevor's work is to be commended.  However, it is inevitable that his work will be compared with his subsequent books on the siege of Stalingrad and the fall of Berlin.  When this comparison is made, it is clear that \\"The Spanish Civil War\\" is a markedly lesser effort than his later works.  Yet do not let this fact deter the keen reader of history.  Spain was a massive tragedy and its story needs to be understood.	2004-12-22

In crude terms, he is the equivalent of a US state governor.<br /><br />Unlike most politicians, Bob Carr is an intellectual.  One wonders if his talents are being best used in the hurly burly of state politics; in the proverbial \\"bear pit\\" that is the NSW lower house of parliament.  This book thus may come as something of a surprise to those not familiar with the author.<br /><br />Carr's interests are diverse.  He is a student of American history and his love for the country and its people is very apparent in his writings.  He writes of Abraham Lincoln and of meeting Bill Clinton.  He has a keen knowledge of the Civil War. He is a member of the Chester A. Arthur Society; a group dedicated to the study of US politics and its institutions.  Yet he also tries his hand at fiction and speaks of his own youth when he first joined the Labor Party at the age of fifteen.  His interest are diverse and his passion for places and issues always strong.<br /><br />Carr's \\"Thoughtlines\\" is an unusual book.  It is well written and often speaks form the heart.  Perhaps Carr's background as a journalist shows through in his writings?<br /><br />I would be surprised if many US readers seek this book out to read.  More's the pity.  It is a thoughtful collection of short stories, speeches and articles that are very illuminating.  Make the effort.  You will not be disappointed.	2004-12-11

The strength of this work was that Shirer was a direct observer of the events.  His history was first hand.<br /><br />At the time of reading Shirer, it was suggested to me that I also delve into Speer's \\"Inside the Third Reich\\".  It was my great mistake not to have heeded this advice and only now read Speer's work.  Speer was the ultimate insider.<br /><br />Speer's writing style is particularly elegant.  His work is easy to read and it has a steady flow.  More important, however, is the fact that Speer truly saw the rise and fall of the Third Reich from the inside.  He was no mere observer but a participant.  An architect by training, Speer became Hitler's principal architect prior to World War II and, when the war started, was appointed as Minister for Armaments.  His role was to keep the war machine producing at maximum capacity.<br /><br />As time progressed and after the belated entry of America into the war, it was inevitable that Nazi Germany was heading to defeat.  Yet Hitler fought to the bitter end.  The Red Army was approaching the entry to his bunker before he finally took his own life.<br /><br />Through the war, Speer remained committed to his job and, by default at least, committed to Hitler.  However, towards the end of the book, Speer begins to have doubts.  He even shows an inkling of remorse.  This fact and his not being directly involved in mass deaths saved him from the gallows at Nuremberg.  Whether this result was fair is a matter of some argument.  I am inclined to the view that his twenty year sentence was probably sufficient punishment.  Others may disagree.  Speer argues his case eloquently.<br /><br />To many readers of this review, the very thought of reading the memoirs of one of Hitler's operatives may be anathema.  Do not let this point be discouraging.  This book is excellent.  Its writing style is of a similar high calibre.  I commend this work to all readers of 20th century history.libre.

Martin Ewans' short work, although providing only a high level view, covers these bloody events that traverse the centuries.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ewans' work is often not easy reading.  His prose is dry and wordy.  It requires a patient mind to persevere.  However, attention to detail can be rewarding as Ewans slowly unravels the internecine politics of Afghanistan.<br /><br />To understand the modern history of Afghanistan, one needs to understand the broad sweep of history.  Afghanistan has, in recent times, been the home of modern terrorism.  This terrorism has found root in a soil of prejudice and injustice.  Indeed, Afghanistan must surely be teetering on the edge of being a failed state.  Perhaps it is already at this point?<br /><br />Afghanistan is a tragedy.  Yet it is has always been so.  Ewans meticulously outlines how this tragedy has unfolded.  It is a further tragedy that the West has turned a blind eye to this benighted country.  Its people deserve better.	2004-10-15

This short work by Lynne Truss is a pedant's delight as it takes a knife to all those who mangle the English language with sloppy, lazy or just plain stupid use or misuse of punctuation.  In an era of the internet, mobile phones and emoticons, it is a pleasure to read the work of someone who cares about the written word.<br /><br />One of the great beauties of English is its marvelous flexibility.  There is no equivalent to the Academie Francaise with its pernickety rules that only serve to hinder the development of French as a modern language.  However, having said that, English is being done no favours by those who think that rules are irrelevant.  English is a precise language and if people fail to abide by basic structural features (that is, punctuation) then we are all the worse for it.<br /><br />As one who works in an office, it never ceases to amaze and anger me that so many seemingly intelligent people have such a poor grasp of the written sentence.  Only yesterday, I was asked to \\"please enshore that this job is done\\".  I'm not kidding!  The writer of this email has ensured that, in the future, he can only be regarded as a fool!<br /><br />So, for all pedants of the language, buy and read this book.  You will not be disappointed.	2004-09-25

Here, we have the tale of a group of men, known to each other, who truly helped shape the modern world.  The names are a \\"whose who\\" of early Industrial Age science and industry: James Watt, Erasmus Darwin (yes, the grandfather to Charles), Josiah Wedgewood and Joseph Priestley amongst others.  It would have been marvelous to have been in the company of these men; to have been a fly on the wall at their meetings.<br /><br />Yet, for all the wonder that these names invoke, Jenny Uglow's work fails to provide the reader with a true sense of understanding.  The book's theme or direction is not clear.  She seems to jump about without explanation and the reader is left to catch up.  This is a great shame.  Indeed, if the events could have been more succinctly tied together, \\"The Lunar Men\\" could have been a great book.  As it is, the concept is great but the follow through is lacking.<br /><br />My recommendation to readers is that the book be read (albeit only with luke warm encouragement) but beware that a theme is missing and no one character stands out.  This is a pity as the concept behind the book is grand.	2004-09-21

This vast often frozen country that has defied conquerors over time has also been unwilling to undergo liberal democratic progress.  Russia has truly been a mystery.<br /><br />It was Napoleon's view that Russia could be beaten.  It was inevitable that this huge but primitive country would be no match for his Grand Armee.  His victory would act as a spur for still greater future victories.<br /><br />However, Russia could not be broken.  In fact, even though Napoleon actually reached Moscow, the actions of scorched earth plus the horrors of a Russian winter could not be overcome.<br /><br />Adam Zamoyski succeeds admirably in bringing the horrors of Napoleon's initial victories then subsequent defeats to the stark attention of the reader.  War is never pleasant but the winter of 1812 must have been plumbing new depths.  Zamoyski is a fine historian.<br /><br />It is perhaps inevitable that Zamoyski's work will be compared with Antony Beevor's work on the German defeat at Stalingrad.  Personally, if it is possible to compare, then I recommend the latter.  However, the two books perform a similar task in explaining why Russia has not bowed to conquerors nor yield many clues to its mystery.	2004-08-21

Alas, I was let down.  \\"Going After Cacciato\\" is confusing at best as the reader is dragged from the real world to the surreal in seemingly alternating chapters.<br /><br />On face value, the story concerns Cacciato, a US Army private in the Vietnam War, who chooses to go AWOL and walk from Vietnam to Paris.  However, this madly surreal story simply provides the palate for O'Brien to outline some of the horrors of war.  And all wars involve horrors.  Vietnam was no exception.<br /><br />By using the technique of alternating between the surreal and the real, I found that O'Brien only succeeded in confusing and often irritating the reader.  Surrealism has its place but its use in this novel causes matters to slide into the absurd.<br /><br />This novel is not the great war novel that other reviewers suggest.  It is simply a work that takes too much for granted.  Having written one great war novel in \\"The Things They Carried\\" does not mean that another work on the same base subject matter will inevitably follow.  \\"Going After Cacciato\\" is over rated.	2004-08-19

I am very glad that he took the time to contact me.<br /><br />In brief, \\"Every Time I Talk to Liston\\" is the story of Amos \\"Scrap Iron\\" Fletcher and his slow and tortuous progress with his charge who goes by the name of \\"TNT\\".  However, although progress is slow, TNT eventually captures the world heavy weight title and it is this progress that is the subject of the book.<br /><br />If the novel has a flaw it is that it is often too predictable.  There is little doubt that, by the end of the book, TNT will capture his prize.  To offset this predictability, DeVido uses a series of flash backs and intermissions that draw on the career of Sonny Liston, the man beaten by a young Cassius Clay for the title.  Liston casts a long shadow and proves to be an inspiration for both Scrap Iron and TNT.  His role is somewhat messianic.  This technique of DeVido's adds luster to the story.  It is very clever.<br /><br />Much as I was encouraged to read the novel, I too would encourage its reading.  DeVido is a good writer and with \\"Every Time I Talk to Liston\\" being his first novel, his future looks bright.	2004-08-09

Apparently, the book is on the California school curriculum.<br />Tim O'Brien has written a nicely paced novel that differs greatly from the traditional war story.  The novel is essentially a series of short stories that have been loosely tied together.  The stories serve to give the reader a feel for Vietnam and the quandaries that the war generated.  Was the war right?  Should a draftee flee to Canada rather than just simply accept the bloodshed in a civil war that seemed to have no purpose?  O'Brien offers no clear answers.  Rather he leaves the questions hanging with the reader compelled to come to his or her own conclusions.<br />The novel is not wantonly gruesome as war must often seem to its participants.  It is simply a telling of certain events that must have had some impact on the author.  Yes, war is hell but lessons can be learned.  Tim O'Brien has played his role in this process.  The book should be read by a wider audience than just high school students in the USA.	2004-07-19

Far from providing any insights to the tumultuous events of 1918 and the lead up to the Armistice, the book is a turgid rendition of confusing details.  Indeed, it took great patience to reach its end.<br />Thus, in light of the above, I cannot recommend this book to any general reader.  Be advised, seek facts elsewhere.	2004-05-07

However, after seeing the movie and being totally mesmerised by the whole concept, the book became a must read.<br />Chuck Palahnuik has created a very unusual novel.  Written in the first person but at times offering confusion as to who is the narrator of the tale, the book is a roller coaster of emotions.  Who is Tyler Durden?  Against what is he rebelling?  What on earth will be the outcome?<br />In many respects, \\"Fight Club\\" is a whole new genre.  It is chaotic.  It is anarchic.  In fact, the whole tale is more.  It is truly nihilistic.  Tyler Durden inhabits a bizarre underworld where the rules are just so different from every where else.  Fight club's first rule is that no one talks about fight club.  Its second rule is that no one talks about fight club.  Yet fight club keeps growing before evolving into acts of criminal intent where lives become of little value and social norms are rejected.<br />When reading this book, do not expect a macho punch up novel.  It is far more.  It is a trip through another world.  It is a tour de force.	2004-04-27

I last read this book as a teenager and, although I enjoyed it then, it is a real delight to an adult.<br />In essence, the book outlines the life and lifestyle of Jay Gatsby who lived on Long Island near New York City in the 1920s.  His background is shrouded in some mystery with various reports that he has been a killer, a bootlegger and a fixer of baseball's 1919 World Series.  However, the key to his background is unrequited love for Daisy Buchanan who he knew at the time of the First World War and before he was sent away to France.  Unfortunately, during his wartime absence, Daisy has married someone else and Gatsby is left yearning for her company.  He throws vast and extravagant parties in the hope that Daisy might drop by and their love can be rekindled.  His love rules his life as, across the water from his house, he can see the distant green light at the end of the pier at Daisy's home.  This distant light epitomises his love for Daisy; it is far away yet still burning.<br />Without wrecking the plot for those readers who may not be so familiar with the book, Gatsby's life ends with pain and misery and no renewal of love.  In this sense, the book takes on the character of a Shakespearean tragedy.<br />I can recommend this book to all readers of great fiction.  \\"The Great Gatsby\\" has a timeless quality.  It has endured for decades so far and will endure for many more to come.	2004-04-18

At the outset and in order to minimalise any suggestions of pre-conceived bias, I am not a Christian.  Indeed, I am not a believer in any faith.  I chose to read \\"The da Vinci Code\\" simply as a piece of escapist literature.  The book largely fills this capacity.<br />I am puzzled as to how people can be offended or shocked by Brown's work.  It would seem that some people are easily upset and prone to self-righteousness.  The book involves a series of murders that are all related with a clear Christian sub-text.  In this sense, I think the book justifiably earns three stars from five.<br />As to the sub-text, the book suggests that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdalene and had at least one child.  So what!  A thirty two year old man 2,000 years ago would be very unusual if he had not married.  Why on earth is this such a big deal?  Surely, the Christian faith is strong enough without being seriously challenged by one book?<br />Returning to the novel at a more general level, Brown has produced a stock standard thriller.  The plot reveals itself with a religious theme but ends more with a whimper than a bang.  Read the book to be informed as to all the fuss, but do not expect a work of literary greatness.	2004-04-12

The book is truly \\"unputdownable\\" and if it were not a history book, it could almost have read as a novel.<br />The end of the Romanov dynasty is a work of tragedy.  Here we have this closely bound intimate family playing out a drama against the backdrop of the First World War and the Russian Revolution.  Yet tragedy almost becomes farce when the role of Rasputin is considered.  The Czarina is quite spellbound by the man despite the damage that his decisions have for the family and the dynasty.<br />In \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\", we see the unfolding of the downfall of autocracy which, in due course, would have been inevitable.  The First World War simply accelerated the process.  Yet while we should shed no tears for the fall of autocrats, the rise of an even more vile autocracy under Lenin heaps tragedy upon tragedy.  The history of modern Russia is tragedy writ large.<br />Robert K Massie covers the events leading to the execution of the royal family in great detail but without ever deluging the reader with arcane facts that detract from the picture that he paints.  The end result is a work of substance and colour.<br />I emphatically recommend this book to all readers of modern history.  Robert K Massie has excelled!	2004-04-01

It differs, therefore, from many other books about Cuba.  Corbett is no Miami based Cuban exile with a chip on his shoulder but nor is he a naïve promoter of the Communist Party government.  In short, Corbett has real credibility.<br />From another angle, Corbett is clearly no blow in visitor who, after a week or two in the country, regards himself as some sort of expert.  Instead, Corbett has visited the country on a number of occasions and for considerable lengths of time in each case.  He has immersed himself in the country from a variety of perspectives and has clearly travelled widely and met a host of individuals, many of whom he now counts as friends.<br />It seems to me that Corbett has a love for Cuba but a distinct distaste for the regime.  Yet for all this, he has no axe to grind.  Far too many critical Cuba commentators are allied with the exile communities in Florida.  Unfortunately, for all the errors and flaws of the regime, its hasty end may well herald the return of the exiles and a still less than positive outcome.  There may be no velvet revolution.<br />I recommend this book to all readers interested in Cuba and its future.	2004-02-27

The book was given to me at Christmas by my brother in law. I'm not sure what that says about his interpretation of me.<br />To true crime buffs, this is probably a great book.  However, to the more geneal reader such as myself, I often found the writing style tedious and self-congratulatory.  The cases are often fascinating, it is the style that grates.<br />In spite of the style, there are some highlights to the book.  The Sam Shepard where he murdered his wife and the events of Waco Texas are bizarre to the extreme.  The Buddhist temple massacre is a display of humanity at its worst.  There is truly some real evil locked away in some members of the population.  McCrary is simply outlining the facts that the rest of us may choose to ignore.<br />Finally, if nothing else, this book proves that although true crime literature has its followers, I am not one of them.	2004-02-15

His background is truly fascinating and his views often contrary to the mainstream.  His long term membership of the British Communist Party certainly places him within a very small group by any measure.<br />However, I must admit that I was often disappointed in Hobsbawm's work.  There were large sections of pontificating rather than him outlining the so-called interesting times in which he lived.  And let there be on mistake, Hobsbawm did live in interesting times.  He was born in the year of the Russian Revolution to an Austrian mother and British father who were both Jews in Vienna during the dying days of the Hapsburg Empire.  His early education was in Vienna while his later education was in Britain where he ultimately went on to study at Cambridge.  Throughout his life, he travelled widely and truly met many interesting people.  Thus, my only concern with his book is that his interesting life can sometimes play second fiddle to his opinions.  But perhaps this is always the way with historians.  They are here to interpret the world and not simply narrate.<br />Read Hobsbawm's work for an opinion on the twentieth century but not have expectations that you are going to read a tour de force of the century's movers and shakers.	2004-02-01

It is a situation where one group of trained individuals is trying as hard as humanly possible to kill another like minded group.  It is a case of the ends justifying the means.<br />Erich Maria Remarque has truly succeeded in bringing some of the horror of war to the written page.  In this regard, he has succeeded where many others have failed.<br />Remarque's work is a classic.  It covers the war experiences of Paul Baumer who is fighting for the German fatherland during the Fist World War.  In this context, the work is unique as most novels tell the tale from the Allied side.  Yet despite this fact, the work transcends loyalties.  War is often futile in a broad sense.  In an immediate sense, decision making is often chaotic with terrible consequences for the foot soldiers baring the brunt of any onslaught.<br />I would recommend \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" to all readers.  Although it was written at the conclusion of World War I, its relevance is undiminished by time.  It is a timeless work whose message still strikes a chord in the current day and will probably do so for centuries to come.	2004-01-12

He took on the vested interests of slavery and ultimately prevented the dissolution of the Union.  Furthermore, his untimely death lifted his status to that of a martyr.  In this case, however, his martyrdom is well warranted.<br />Keneally's work is an excellent starting point for any reader seeking an introduction to Lincoln.  This book is part of a larger series covering a host of international luminaries.  Lincoln's place in this pantheon is well deserved.  The book itself is wonderful read for those wishing to understand Lincoln's place in history.	2003-12-28

In each case, tens of thousands of lives were sacrificed to gain, in some cases, only a few extra metres of territory.  Such is the insanity of war.<br />Unfortunately, Marix Evans is unable to convey the magnitude of events to the reader.  I found myself lost in the description of the divisions and brigaes without gaining an appreciation of what was actually happening.<br />In sum, the book was a disappointment.

Anyone who has read \\"Dreadnought\\" which concerns the lead up to World War I would probably concur.  It is a master epic of naval history.<br />\\"The Romanovs: The Final Chapter\\" is a very different book to \\"Dreadnought\\".  It seems to be a means of cashing in on the current interest in European aristocracy and the ongoing mystique of whether Anastasia Romanov died with her parents and siblings in Ekaterinburg in 1918 at the hands of the Bolsheviks.  However, while being a very different style of book, it is also a much less readable and significant piece of history.  The reader seems to be on an endless journey through the minutiae of the Russian royal family and all the crackpots who claim a part of their heritage.  It is not a read that is pleasant or easy to follow.<br />I am unable to recommend this book to other readers.  The Romanovs are no longer of any modern day relevance.  This book, if it has one redeeming feature, is to confirm their irrelevance.	2003-12-01

Arguably, this would seem to be the case from the information presented but, so what?  Does this really affect how the man operates on a day to day basis today?  Let's put this historical irrelevance behind us.  Or perhaps Bush should just own up?  Now that really would be sensational, especially in a country like the USA.<br />Similarly, the author's background is equally irrelevant.  Should it matter that he is a convicted felon?  The fact that Hitchfield has a criminal past should have no impact on the quality of his book.  Let bygones be bygones.<br />Beyond the matter of drugs, this book is a fairly standard biography that is well written and concise.  I would recommend it to readers on this basis alone.  The matter of drugs is really just a minor part of the book and any reader expecting to find a detailed expose will be disappointed.  Overall, Hitchfield has produced a book of some substance but the market is focussing only on the issue of substance abuse.  This is a pity.	2003-11-10

It fails, however, to leave the reader with an understanding of the horror of war or a clear view of what events were critical.<br />\\"The Infernal Cauldron\\" is long on detail as to the specific movement of troops but, in so doing, serves to lose the reader from the bigger picture.  We are constantly updated as to where particular Armies and Divisions were moving but are shown few maps.  The reader is thus easily lost in the minutae without developing a fuller understanding of the battle.<br />Offsetting the flaws of detail, the book has numerous glossy black and white photos that show some of the key players such as Paulus and his generals.  It also reproduces other photos of the phenomenal destruction that was unleashed on this one city.<br />Finally, as with all books on the subject of Stalingrad, comparison with Antony Beevor's great work is inevitable.

It was here that Hitler's maniacal plans truly collapsed.  His army was routed and the Soviet Union began the process of driving his forces all the way back to Berlin.<br />Beevor captures much of the depravity of war.  How ordinary soldiers became beasts and how civilian populations were trampled by all those under arms.  Beevor describes all with great clarity.<br />However, from a literary point of view, it is inevitable that Beevor's \\"Stalingrad\\" will be compared with his \\"Berlin\\".  In this regard, \\"Stalingrad\\" triumphs as it deals with the great battle in detail without losing the reader in its arcane intricacies.  \\"Berlin\\", by contrast, seems overloaded with the miseries inflicted upon the civilian population without satisfactorily explaining the military movements that created the civilian miseries in the first place.<br />Although I am firmly of the view that \\"Stalingrad\\" is the better read, this should not put off readers from delving into \\"Berlin\\".  To understand the eastern front in World War II helps in understanding subsequent political changes in Europe.  So, just as the battle for Stalingrad begat the fall of Berlin, so the fall of Berlin begat the emergence of Churchill's iron curtain and the creation of the Soviet bloc.	2003-08-26

Compared to his earlier autobiographical works such as \\"Unreliable Memoirs\\" it is tedious and inclined to wallow in self importance.<br />Many of the book's articles were taken from New Yorker magazine and, perhaps it goes without saying, that they are long and rambling.  To spend half an hour reading some dreary set of opinions on an esoteric film director is not fun.  I often found myself flicking through the pages to the next article in the hope that it would be more enticing.<br />However, two sections were genuinely interesting.  His articles on Princess Diana are adulatory in the extreme but quite readable.  Unfortunately, I cannot lose my view that she was granted importance well beyond her abilities.  Also, his final section on the Sydney Olympics show real insight to the events of September 2000.  To have been in Sydney at that time was to witness something quite magical and James does succeed in passing some of the magic to the reader.<br />Overall, I cannot recommend this book to the reader.  Two sections of interest fail to overcome the remainder of the book and its tediousness.	2003-06-30

Through all the years leading up to World War II, Churchill alone understood the Nazi menace.<br />Every step along the road of appeasement was another potentially destructive step for democracy.  It fed the Nazi appetite for power and revenge.  Appeasement was also incredibly naïve although this is said with the benefit of hindsight.  Churchill, by way of contrast, was saying these things at the time.  He saw the dangers in turning a blind eye to the surrender of the Rhineland, Austria and finally Czechoslovakia.  The line drawn at Poland was too late. It meant that the war had to be fought from a weaker position than could have otherwise been the case if the democracies of western Europe had taken an earlier stand.<br />Churchill's memoirs are long on detail and probably meant for a keen reader of modern history.  Do not let this fact alienate potential readers.  Churchill actually made history and his views remain relevant.	2003-06-06

In the interim we are introduced to the various monarchs of the Hanover dynasty, the emergence of an independent America after the revolutionary war and, finally, the positioning of England as a power after seeing off Napoleon.  This truly was the period where the English speaking peoples began their rise to a prominent place on the world stage.<br />I can heartily recommend Churchill to all readers.  He was a great political leader but, it needs to be remembered, he earned his income from writing and journalism and was also a recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature.	2003-05-05

I had heard much of this book and expected something more insightful than the actuality.<br />Gleick's book is anything but fast.  It is slow, ponderous and desperately in search of meaning.  It is one long series of trite anecdotes.<br />As an airport book merely serving to while away some hours on a long distance flight, \\"Faster\\" may be useful.  However, even this is probably stretching the reality.  Overall, the book is anything but fast and I would encourage readers to search elsewhere for a more meaningful view of modern life.	2003-04-18

In its brief 180 pages, an overview of where and when Columbus travelled is well chronicled.<br />There are perhaps too many people who know of Columbus only that \\"in 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue\\".  Yet Columbus did more than just sail.  Although he never discovered America and constantly thought he had arrived in Asia, he nonetheless served as the spark to the later journeys that would fully reveal the New World.  Unfortunately, both his journeys and those of his followers would do much to injure the indigenous people with the introduction of disease and slavery.<br />If you are searching for a primer on Columbus and the New World, Least Heat-Moon's book serves that purpose well.  If, however, you are looking for something of greater substance, look to other sources.	2003-03-30

He has little time for some of the touchy feely theories that masquerade as science in learning institutions today.  He reserves special criticism for those individuals who think that humans are born with a brain as a blank slate waiting to absorb all its ideas from its immediate environment.  He also has little time for those believers of the \\"ghost in the machine\\" and the so called \\"noble savage\\".<br />To any parent, it should be obvious that children are born with inherited characteristics that remain with them for the rest of their lives.  An introverted child will be an introverted adult.  To Pinker, an example such as this should be self obvious but, for whatever reason, some people choose to deny reality.  We certainly don't deny inherited physical traits such as skin colour or body shape so why do we deny inherited traits relating to human nature?<br />Read this book with an open mind and see the world without scales on you eyes!	2003-03-05

Unfortunately, this was not to be the case.<br />&quot;About a Boy&quot; is simply too far fetched to be funny.  It is hard to imagine someone going through a road to Damascus conversion and changing from an embittered person to a person who only does &quot;good&quot;.  While the style is perhaps classic Hornby, the subject matter just simply doesn't work.<br />My advice to readers new to Hornby is to read his other works before this one.  If this one is chosen as your introduction to the author, my fear is that your introduction will have no follow up.  And that would be a shame as Hornby has much to offer.	2003-02-03

It brings to life the horror or war and, indeed, the horror of war at its worst.<br />Ostensibly, the book is a tie in with the movie of the same name although it was written long before the movie was ever made.  The so called movie tie in is little more than a piece of marketing hype.<br />As it was with Napoleon, so it was with Hitler.  Russia proved to be the downfall of both.  William Craig illustrates the pig headedness of Hitler and how this pig headedness contributed to his demise.<br />Read this book not as story of the deeds of Vassily Zaitzev, the Russian sniper around whom the movie is made but, rather, as a history of an epic battle that was the beginning of the end of the Thousand Year Reich.	2003-01-24

It has sat in my book shelf collecting dust.  The pity is that I did not read it sooner.<br />Churchill provides a lively and readable account of the great democracies of the 19 th Century.  He starts with the years following the Napoleonic Wars and concludes with the Boer War.  In between, he covers the American Civil War in some detail as well as progress in the other English speaking nations of Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.  He also touches on other issues in Europe, particularly the rise of Germany under Bismarck.<br />I can thoroughly recommend this book to the reader of general history.  It has whetted my appetite to go back and read the earlier volumes.  If they should be half as good as this one, it will be a pleasant journey.	2002-12-19

However, the author perhaps plays his hand a little too hard.<br />I have some trouble believing that freer trade is not to the benefit of poorer nations. Economics 101 would tell you otherwise but for some reason this point does not sink in with some writers. They seem to believe that regulated trade can produce some sort of optimal outcome. Tell that to the consumers of the Soviet Union.<br />Yet while I am not in complete agreement with Herstgaard's economics, I am compelled to agree with his interpretation of how Americans view the wider world. In this regard, I spent two years living in the United States as well as having two childen presently at school there. I therefore think I have some perspective on the matter. Accordingly, American's are simply ignorant of the wider world. Indeed, more so than any other comparable country.<br />Overall, Herstagaard is on the right track if only he would leave economics to the real world rather than thinking that a benign bureaucracy can produce a better world.	2002-11-10

Hollywood has been hard at work creating an image which, while ghoulish, is much different than the novel.<br />Bram Stoker's book is subtle and chilling.  Dracula is all pervasive and immensely powerful.  He is cold and can find his victim almost anywhere.<br />I recommend this book to everyone.  The reader will be unnerved by its pricipal character but pleased that the novel itself is so different from the standard dross dished out by Hollywood.  Read it and relish in Dracula in his original carnation.	2002-11-04

I occasionally indulge myself with his world.  &quot;Chance&quot;, however, is not one of Parker's better works.<br />Can I suggest to American readers that they try to get hold of books by Peter Corris and his character Cliff Hardy who is a Sydney based Private Investigator and a little less slick than Spenser.  The style of writing is similar but Cliff seems to dwell more in the real world than Spenser.<br />Regardless, I will continue to delve back into Spenser although &quot;Chance&quot; is not one of Parker's best.	2002-10-10

There is no other book that more evokes a conception of America than this work.  It is America!<br />Since reading Least Heat-Moon, I have delved into Kerouac (On the Road) and Steinbeck (Travels with Charley) but none of these books remotely compares with the imagery of Blue Highways.  Indeed, just tapping the keys for this review makes me unsettled, wishing that I too could just travel those back roads soon along America's blue highways.	2002-03-22
