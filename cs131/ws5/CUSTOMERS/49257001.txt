One of the pioneer researchers in this exciting new field is Joshua Leeds, a composer, writer, and consultant.  He has analyzed and compiled the studies and known data in The Power of Sound, his latest book.<br /> His work is based on the premise that sound is a nutrient for the nervous system.  Thus different sounds have varying effects on listeners.  Although music is sound, not all sound is music.  He discusses exactly what sound is, what it does to us, and what it can do for us.  He emphasizes that we need to develop \\"sonic responsibility,\\" that is, an awareness of the sounds continually bombarding us and taking steps to protect ourselves from harmful noises.<br /> Leeds says that \\"Sound, like other elements, can fuel or deplete us,&quot; adding that \\"increasing noise pollution affects the planet's citizenry physiologically and psychologically.\\"<br /> He explains vibration, resonance, and entrainment, and how those can have a negative or positive effect on people.  He then discusses therapeutic uses of sound, and includes a section detailing how to select particular sounds to accomplish certain goals.  For example, high sounds will \\"charge\\" the system and increase activity, while bass sounds can \\"discharge\\" the system and decrease activity.<br /> He also includes information for health practitioners for use in correcting various conditions, such as learning disabilities, relaxation techniques, and reduction of medications.<br /> Extensive appendices provide additional information on music, sound and music therapy, and resources.  Leeds also includes a CD with specially orchestrated music designed for motivation, relaxation, learning, inspiration, productivity, and concentration.<br /> Leeds says that \\"we have come to understand the extraordinary power of the ear.  In addition to its critical functions of communication and balance, the ear's primary purpose is to recycle sound and so recharge our inner batteries.\\"  Readers will find that The Power of Sound gives them all the information and techniques they need to use their own marvelous ears and sound to enhance their lives.harge our inner batteries.\\"  Readers will find that The Power of Sound gives them all the information and techniques they need to use their own marvelous ears and sound to enhance their lives.	2003-06-13

His latest, Yoga: The Ultimate Spiritual Path, is \\"a remarkable synthesis of yoga psychology and metaphysics.\\"<br /> In it, he traces the history of yogic philosophy and its development over time, emphasizing its role in spiritual unfolding.  He does not include any yoga postures, leaving that up to individual instructors.  \\"Yoga is neither a religion by itself nor part of any other religious system,\\" he says, adding that \\"yoga is universal and a yogi is not necessarily bound to any particular religious faith.\\"  He defines it as \\"the union between the individual self and the universal self.\\"  Yoga is available to anyone who wishes to accept its discipline.<br /> Muni discusses yoga practices relating to a variety of areas, such as rebirth, karma, the purpose of life, bliss, human consciousness, and suffering.  Although yoga is an ancient practice, its underlying philosophy is timeless and still relevant to those wishing to transform their lives.  Classical yoga focuses on spiritual development and the attainment of higher levels of consciousness, and this is what Muni concentrates on throughout his writing.<br /> \\"Yoga: The Ultimate Spiritual Path provides a comprehensive overview of traditional yoga philosophy for the Western reader and at the same time creates a context that helps us place ourselves on the spiritual pathway, so that we may understand the deeper purpose for our existence.\\"  It's essential reading for all those interested in philosophy.

He says that his book \\"follows the thought progression of Patanjali, author of the Yogasutras, but it adds material gathered from my guru and from other authentic yoga texts.\\"<br /> Ramaswami includes the history of the development of yoga, and discusses the roles of chanting and scripture study in making yoga part of lifestyle, rather than just a routine.  He also devotes large sections to the importance of proper breathing while performing the yoga postures.  Correct breathing \\"helps one to reach and work on the deeper muscles and organs inside the body, which may not be possible otherwise.\\"  Additionally it aids in relaxation and concentration.<br /> The remainder of the book describes the yoga postures.  Each has detailed written instructions, as well as photographs.  Ramaswami notes whether each posture can be safely done by those with physical ailments.  He includes a chapter on yoga practices for pregnant women.<br /> While he does include basic yoga postures and complete instructions, Ramaswami notes that his book is not for beginners, but rather for those who have been practicing for some time and/or have a knowledgeable teacher to guide them.<br /> He says that \\"my goal is to portray the three aspects of yoga-as art, physical therapy, and philosophy-that are appropriate for the young, for the middle-aged, and for retirees, in that order.\\"  Readers will discover that he met this goal in Yoga for the Three Stages of Life.appropriate for the young, for the middle-aged, and for retirees, in that order.\\"  Readers will discover that he met this goal in Yoga for the Three Stages of Life.	2003-06-13

Respected as an authentic investigator of spirituality and parapsychology, Mishlove writes books, hosts a talk show on public television, and serves as a director of Intuition Network.<br />  He established contact with Ted Owens in 1976 and began \\"an investigation into the supposed powers and life of this eccentric man.\\"  He witnessed and recorded demonstrations, interviewed other witnesses, and collected documentation.  After years of observations and study, he concluded that \\"Ted Owens had the rare gift of mind-over-matter.\\"<br /> Mishlove analyzes everything that's known about Owens, including his often petty uses of his powers.<br /> Owens took credit for causing earthquakes, hurricanes and other weather disturbances, and power blackouts.  He wanted to be believed and have his powers accepted, but often chose the wrong way in his aggressive attempts to gain attention.<br /><br />  Because of his capricious nature, Owens was often dismissed as a crackpot.  He also claimed to have received his powers from \\"Space Intelligences\\" and at times said his actions were directed by the Intelligences rather than himself.  Some experts claimed that Owens had psychic abilities which allowed him to accurately forecast events, rather than to cause those events as he claimed to do.<br /> Mishlove attempts to sort through all the conflicting claims and confusion surrounding Owens.  He doesn't always agree with what Owens has to say, and at one time angered the self-styled PK Man to the point of retaliation.

Where does it go when we die?  Ronald Russell explores the answers to questions like this in his latest book, The Vast Enquiring Soul.  A graduate of Oxford University, Russell has written thirteen other books.  He describes this one as \\"a journey of exploration into the further reaches of consciousness.\\"  He says that consciousness is \\"our ability to know and understand, to be aware of ourselves and the world around us.\\"<br /> As part of his explorations, Russell delves into matters like psychokinesis (mind over matter), distant healing, remote viewing, and near-death and out-of-body experiences.  His research has led him to the conclusion that consciousness \\"doesn't reside merely in the brain, but within our bodies, the earth, and the universe.\\"<br /> He relies not only on his own studies, but also those conducted by others from a variety of disciplines.  He very neatly weaves all the available information into a tapestry of science, philosophy, theology, poetry, history, and the paranormal.<br /> Russell says that consciousness is a part of everything that happens from before we're born until after we die.  He asserts that consciousness isn't the same as soul--that our souls are the essential part of us that holds all our aspects, including mind, body, and consciousness, together.  He urges the scientific world to consider the soul, and consciousness, when doing research; and advocates a new branch of study devoted to learning more about both the soul and consciousness and their roles in making us who and what we are.<br /> \\"The more we can discover about our consciousness,\\" Russell says, \\"the more of our potential as human beings we are likely to realize.\\"  The Vast Enquiring Soul is essential reading for all those interesting in exploring the most interesting frontier of all--their own consciousness.	2003-06-13

Since then he's been devoted to spiritual and humanitarian activities, including writing about his experiences.  His latest endeavor, Transitions of the Soul, is a collection of true stories from people who've had contact with deceased loved ones.<br /> All the stories reinforce the idea that the soul does not die, but lives on in peace and happiness.  Bunick says that \\"perhaps the most important discovery I have made is that there is no such thing as death.  Death is only a transition of our spirits and souls from the confinement of our physical bodies into the spiritual world.\\"<br /> Those who offer comfort from the other side do so in different ways.  To reflect this, Bunick has divided the book into five parts: Visitations; Angels; Sights, Smells, and Sounds; Dreams; and Extraordinary Personal Stories.  Each part includes a collection of stories told by ordinary people in their words of how they learned the soul continues on after the body dies.<br /> Bunick \\"brings us a cure of the grieving heart and a balm for the universal fear of dying.\\"  Transitions of the Soul will provide comfort and inspiration to all who read it.	2003-06-13

He says writing is a way to \\"share our humanness,\\" and that \\"being true to ourselves is what gives our writing fire.\\"  In the Revised Edition of Write From The Heart: Unleashing The Power of Your Creativity, he shares the insights he's gathered over a long career as a prolific writer and creativity coach.<br /> He delves into the sources of creativity, noting that for many people, this requires a certain amount of solitude.  He then discusses language itself, saying that \\"it is the marriage between language and the deep mysteries of the human mind that excites me.\\"  Writers write to tap into that connection, for themselves and for others.  The creativity is within--we only need to learn to recognize and utilize it.<br /> Some people don't have the resources to have a private place of their own for thinking and writing.  Bennett explains how the perfect place can be created through guided imagery.  Writing can help complete the imagery and the imagery helps to make the writing possible.<br /> Early in his career, Bennett learned that having an \\"imaginary reader\\" brings life to writing, whether fiction or nonfiction.  The imaginary reader is the one special individual to whom the writer directs his words.  He explains how to create an imaginary reader and use it to bring humanness and sharing into the writing.<br /> All of us have intensely joyous times in our lives, called peak experiences, and time of deep suffering, which Bennett describes as \\"essential wounds.\\"  Both are a source of personal growth and creativity.  Dreams are another source of creativity--sometimes they lend themselves better to stories than to interpretations.<br /> Writing has the ability to transform the writer and the reader.  In Writing From The Heart, Bennett provides the advice, exercises, and guidance that beginners and experienced writers need \\"to overcome blocks, unleash their inborn creative voice, and channel their creativity toward becoming happily published.\\"to overcome blocks, unleash their inborn creative voice, and channel their creativity toward becoming happily published.\\"	2003-06-13

The channeling lasted for approximately fifteen days, during which time he took copious notes.  He describes his experiences and what he learned from them in The Gathering, his fourth book.  He says that \\"although [his book] begins with an encounter that can only be characterized as `alien,' the theme is not alien contact.  The theme is human consciousness and transformation.\\"<br /> The basic message that \\"The Brothers\\" gave Gammill is that earthly humans are part of a grand experiment.  Our purpose is to learn how to recognize the God within each of us.  This requires change, from the level of DNA outward.  This change is occurring now in each of us.  Like most changes, it can create emotional and physical distress, even disease.<br /> Gammill says that we have free will, but it's guided by our souls.  \\"Everything a person experiences,\\" he says, \\"is determined by his or her soul, which reincarnates from one body to the next...Personal responsibility, not chance, determines your fate.\\"  Between lives, the soul goes to a place of light, where it decides what you will experience in the next lifetime.  All experiences have the ultimate goal of healing the human race so that individuals can increase their awareness of God.  Once awareness and surrender is achieved, which will take thousands of years, individuals will \\"ascend\\" to rejoin with God as one entity.<br /> \\"Compelling and beautifully written, The Gathering can help us understand our alien neighbors and ourselves in a new and positive way.\\"  It's essential reading for all those who have wondered why we are here.	2003-05-30

Jampolsky, Ph.D., psychologist, author, and consultant, offers simple and practical advice for creating happiness without doing anything except changing how we look at life.<br /> The book is divided into twelve sections, one for each of the principles of Attitudinal Healing.  Within each section are several vignettes illustrating how the principles can be applied in everyday life.  Most vignettes are only a page, making them easy to read and understand.<br /> The principles are based on the ideas that love and fear are the only two emotions, that the only problem is a feeling of separation, and that the solution is discovering that the essence of your being is love.  Each section of the book is filled with stories and sayings that illustrate how to trade in fear for love.<br /> Overcoming separation and discovering love requires changing fear-based attitudes, such as anger and guilt.  Dr. Jampolsky says that \\"your attitude in solving any problem is far more important than the particular action you might take.\\"  He reminds us that the key is recognizing that \\"you're not upset because of what occurred, you are upset because of how you perceive the situation.\\"  He offers a huge variety of suggestions for changing perceptions and creating happiness.<br /> He says we can start with a simple action like smiling, even if we don't think we have anything to smile about.  Just that one little act will make a huge difference in how we look at our problems and how we interact with others.  And when others smile back, suddenly we do have something to be happy about.<br /> Dr. Jampolsky also emphasizes that healing comes from letting go of old hurts and resentments.<br /> Smile For No Good Reason \\"presents clear and concise ways-that you can begin right now-to begin living a happier and more meaningful life.

Does throwing salt over your left shoulder keep away bad luck?  Will walking under a ladder bring bad luck?  Armando Benitez thinks the answer to questions like this is yes, and he tells why in his new book, Sheer Superstition.<br /> Benitez says that \\"superstition has been present in the human soul since the first stirrings of the human intellect.\\"  He digs into the reasons for this, searching for the origin of superstitions, and maintains that \\"the basic premise of all superstitions is that we have direct control over our destiny, that we can change our destiny, because we are free to choose the path we wish to traverse.\\"<br /> He turns to the ancient Greeks, using the mythology of the Fates and their control of human fortune, as a model for explaining how events seemingly beyond our ability to influence or change can affect our lives.  Then he describes how we can use superstition to make choices to overcome these events.<br /> The way to make changes in our lives, or destiny, is to start with very small changes.  Those changes often hinge on a stroke of luck.  Benitez believes that certain practices can affect luck, thus giving people a measure of control.<br /> He has bet on horse races for many years, and he uses his racetrack experiences as examples of how people can use superstitions to outwit Fate and improve their luck.  While some superstitions apply only to certain people or at certain times, others are universal.  Benitez describes them all, often with explanations of how they came into being, and explains how individuals can put the relevant ones to work in their own lives.<br /> Benitez says that \\"our luck should be nurtured, just as a sensible person guards his health.\\"  In Sheer Superstition, he provides readers with the knowledge and tools they need to change and nurture their luck.	2003-05-30

She says \\"that this is what many of our scientists today are saying: that all matter, including the human body, is composed of energy or force controlled by consciousness-which lives in everything, forever.\\"  She adds that \\"at the death of the physical matter within which this awareness resides, the soul leaves, sailing forth into other dimensions of time and space.\\"<br /> Although she wondered even as a child about what lay beyond physical life, Smith resisted many of the insights she was given over the years.  Trained as a journalist and scientist, she wanted evidence.  She chronicles her doubts and the events that eventually led her to accept the validity of the information given to her primarily by her spirt guides.<br /> Her guides have continually emphasized that \\"you do survive death and therefore how you live on Earth is important.\\"  She shares the guidelines they've provided her for the spiritual development we need to do in our physical lives in preparation for the life afterward.<br /> Smith has devoted nearly fifty years to investigating spirit communication and survival of the soul.

In it he continues to explore how we can incorporate universal love in our daily lives.  He has chosen the wheel because it has no beginning or end and thus \\"teaches us how to work with the limits of human knowing and how to find peace with our apparent human differences.\\"<br /> Bennett believes that people are searching for ways to become closer to Earth, and finding the solutions in ancient practices, such as shamanism.  He describes \\"nature-based spiritual practices\\" that emphasize the connection between Earth and all its inhabitants.  Some of these practices involve looking at characteristics of certain animals and using them as  models for our own behavior.<br /> He says, however, that animals are not just symbols.  They are living creatures.  We learn from observing them in their natural environments.  Since not everyone can do this, Bennett describes the powers of the seven primary animals with the most to teach us.  These are correlated with the seven chakras, for those who find it easier to think in those terms.  He provides complete instructions for setting up and using an \\"ecospiritual wheel,\\" which helps to establish rituals for learning from animals.<br /> Bennett says that he \\"offers Spirit Animals and the Wheel of Life as a way to begin reclaiming your own ecospiritual connection with our planet--not just as a philosophy but as a practical spirituality and a way of mapping your own path back to the center.\\"  Readers will find that he has provided the knowledge and guidance they need to make their own sacred connections.	2003-05-30

Yet it's treasured by million of Orientals as a valued oracle and tool for divination.<br /><br /> Thanks to J. H. Brennan and his latest book, The Magical I Ching, the ancient wisdom is now accessible to all those wishing guidance in making choices.  Brennan emphasizes that I Ching does not predict the future.  It works by giving you &quot;insight into what's likely to happen if you take a certain course of action.&quot;  He adds, &quot;perhaps even more usefully, it will give you advice on the best course of action to take in order to achieve the ends you desire.&quot;<br /> How can something that's thousands of years old be effective in a contemporary world?  It's based on the principle of synchronicity and the knowledge that everything is in some way connected.  I Ching works &quot;because it senses the hidden linkages&quot; in situations.<br /> Like computers, I Ching is a binary system.  It uses a broken line and a solid line.  These lines are grouped into hexagrams--each hexagram contains a unique arrangement of six lines.  There are a total of 64 hexagrams.  Each hexagram is generated line-by-line.<br /> Hexagrams may be generated in several ways, some of them quite simple.  Brennan discusses the various methods fully, presenting complete details and illustrations.  Once the lines of the hexagram has been determined, it must then be interpreted.  Once again, Brennan comes to the reader's aid--he includes a complete and contemporary translation of every hexagram.<br /> Those consulting the I Ching may use it for advice in everyday decisions, but it can also be used for pathworking, rituals, opening astral doorways, and spiritual guidance.  Brennan weaves instructions for these activities in with the fascinating history of I Ching and his personal experiences.<br /> Brennan has authored more than 70 books and lectures frequently on subjects like metaphysics, spirituality, and psychology.

She is also a Wiccan.  She expertly describes the practice of Wicca in her first book, Simple Wicca.<br /> She explains that \\"Wicca, known also as Witchcraft or the Craft of the Wise, is a beautiful and sacred religion, centuries older than Judeo-Christian theosophy.\\"  It incorporates a reverence for Earth and all living creatures and includes \\"the worship of both the male and female aspects of Divinity.\\"<br /> Many people focus on the word witchcraft and have attributed negative connotations to Wicca.  Morgan stresses that true Wicca has nothing to do with black magic or harming others.  In fact, one of the basic tenets of Wicca is the philosophy of \\"harm none.\\"  Wiccans believe that everything they do comes back to them threefold, and therefore take care not to send out harmful thoughts, words, or actions.<br /> While Wiccans can and do gather in groups to practice their religion, Morgan says \\"there are as many ways to be Wiccan as there are Wiccans; spiritual truths are the sole proprietorship of the individual.\\"  After delving into the history of Wicca traditions and describing the general practices, she explains how to create sacred spaces and develop personal rituals.<br /> Part of this includes the use of \\"magic,\\" which is simply the power given to objects by people to help them enhance their connection to their spiritual practices.  This often involves the use of symbols, such as candles.  She advises \\"with all things in the Craft, use your instincts and your imagination.\\"  Morgan also describes influences and energies, such as the phases of the moon, colors, days of the week, the four directions, and crystals, and tells how to utilize them in creating your own personal magic.<br /> She defines a spell as \\"a prayer acted out,\\" adding that \\"there is literally no end to the creative methods\\" used in creating spells.  She provides detailed instructions for devising spells to fit individual needs.  She then explains the various kinds of rituals, such as blessing, healing, or protection, and again gives detailed instructions for individual practices.  As guidance, she includes examples of spells and rituals she's used.<br /> Morgan says that \\"Wicca is not just a path to follow, it is a life to live, a life of awareness, hope, and love.\\"  Simple Wicca is an excellent resource for all those interested in an ancient wisdom that's become \\"the fastest growing spiritual practice\\" of modern times.  Written in a straightforward and practical way, it will answer all the questions that beginners have and help them get started on their own paths as well as provide a useful reference for experienced practitioners.s for devising spells to fit individual needs.

Those lesions stop the flow of information from the brain to the body, particularly in the arms and legs.  Parts of the body without contact with the brain deteriorate, and people with MS end up with various physical handicaps.  Medical science has no cure for MS.  At best, all they can do is slow the progress of the disease.<br /> Celeste Pepe, D. C., N.D. was diagnosed with MS when she was in her early forties.  A practicing chiropractor and naturopathic doctor, she refused to take the powerful drugs that her medical doctors insisted were her only option.  She decided that not only would she fight MS, she would be healed of it.<br /> Reversing Multiple Sclerosis is the story of her successful search for a cure, a five-year journey into alternative medicine therapies.  She had no special abilities other than a determination to be well, and she tell others that \\"if you are ever diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, you must pursue, with all your might, every doctor, of all varieties, with every healing modality known to them, and never give up, until you find the ones that heal you.\\"<br /> Pepe describes the emotional devastation she felt when she was first diagnosed, and the reactions of her family and friends.  Not everyone supported her when she turned from conventional medicine to alternative therapies.  She shares all that she learned as she consulted each professional, and details their treatments and the effects those treatments had on her.  She relied heavily on what her body told her after each treatment.<br /> She emphasizes that each person is different and not every treatment has the same effect on everyone.  However, through her experience she was able to discover nine steps that will help reverse MS.  Most of these are quite simple, such as dietary changes, but all should be done under the supervision of a professional.  She includes an extensive list of resources.<br /> Reversing Multiple Sclerosis is \\"one woman's courageous journey from incurable illness to optimum health, against all odds and the prognostications of futility and doom from the medical community.\\"  Pepe writes in a personal and friendly manner, and her book is an essential reference for all those who have been diagnosed with MS.st of resources.<br /> Reversing Multiple Sclerosis is \\"one woman's courageous journey from incurable illness to optimum health, against all odds and the prognostications of futility and doom from the medical community.\\"   Pepe writes in a personal and friendly manner, and her book is an essential reference for all those who have been diagnosed with MS.	2003-05-17

Their Practical Guide to Psychic Self-Defense and Well-Being, Second Edition is an update of the acclaimed first edition.<br /> Their publisher notes that there's no shortage of misinformation about the Occult, including psychic attacks, and says that \\"this book will give you a great deal of `correct knowledge' and straighten out a lot of the nonsense . . . that has lead many naive people to walk in fear of demons and curses, of possession and jinxes, and denied to them their own natural psychic talents that would protect them. . . \\"<br /> Denning and Phillips believe that psychic self-defense begins with a strong aura.  They explain exactly what an aura is, distinguishing between the electrical and psychic auras.  Acknowledging that certain situations create fear within us is the first step.  The authors provide tips for recognizing rational and irrational fears and for overcoming them.  They then explain in great detail how to create a \\"tower of light\\" that will \\"make your aura the luminous and potent shield of spiritual protection you ought to have.\\"  With practice, the tower of light can be invoked the instant you feel threatened or attacked.<br /> They go on to discuss the fact that a strong aura offers protection only from outside threats.  Negative emotions attack from within, and weaken the protective light surrounding you.  They also make people more susceptible to attacks made through elementals and sorcery.  Denning and Phillips describe how to overcome attachments and break any links that have been established with unwanted entities.<br /> The authors discuss the role of the occult, and also describe impersonal aggression, such as stress, noise, and drugs.  They also explain how groups, such as business offices, can form a group aura that may be detrimental.  They offer defenses against all these.  In addition to the tower of light, they describe how to use amulets and rituals.  And should all your defenses be penetrated and you suffer psychic damage, they explain the best ways to retaliate.  They also tell readers how to protect themselves against crime and how to keep their children safe.<br /> Denning and Phillips say that \\"psychic self-defense is important in our physical and emotional, even in our mental and spiritual well-being.\\"  The Practical Guide to Psychic Self-Defense and Well-Being provides the information and techniques readers need to develop and strengthen their individual natural and protective powers.addition to the tower of light, they describe how to use amulets and rituals.

Walsch says moments of grace occur \\"when God intervenes in our lives in very real, very direct, and very visible ways.\\"  The intervention usually results in individuals changing the course of their lives.  His book is filled with real-life accounts of such moments.<br /> Walsch asked people who'd had direct, life-changing experiences with God to contact him.  He received an outpouring of stories, from which he selected more than twenty to offer as proof of God's existence.  Each story is interwoven with commentaries and reflections based on the rich material in his earlier books.  He says that his experiences and those of the people who've sent stories to him teaches us \\"that God talks to all of us, all of the time.\\"<br /> Walsch emphasizes that his purpose is not in forcing anyone to believe a particular thing, but rather to simply encourage people to share their experiences and stories.  His goal is to have people \\"tell each other our innermost truth about God, about ourselves, about spirituality, about life, and about all the higher callings of life.\\"  In this way, we can answer for ourselves the important questions about our relationships to the Divine and to each other.  He says we don't know far more than we do know, and it's only through openness and the sharing of our experiences that we can find answers that many of us seek.<br /> Miracles occur every day in every life.  Moments of Grace is designed to help individuals discover those miracles in their own lives.

Muddy Tracks is the chronicle of his quest for answers and self-discovery.  One day he asked the universe, \\"Who am I?\\" and received \\"Muddy footprints in the grass\\" as an answer.<br /> He interpreted this to mean that his experiences could show others the path he'd taken, that he was \\"here to show you that others have passed through what may appear to be a trackless wilderness [and] to encourage others to do some exploring.\\"  His own explorations led him to the knowledge that we are all part of a larger being, and that only our bodies die-our souls live on.<br /><br /> Through the larger being, we are all connected.  This connection makes phenomena like psychic abilities, out-of-body experiences, ghosts, and distant healing available to all who want those experiences and abilities.  DeMarco is guided on a continual basis by spiritual advisors he calls \\"The Gentlemen Upstairs.\\"  That kind of guidance is also available to others.<br /> DeMarco emphasizes that the answers he received and experiences he had were strictly his own.

It can help produce illness and help bring healing, depending on its type and strength.\\"  We are surrounded by electromagnetism--nearly everything produces magnetic fields, including the human body.

They then describe, in general,  how negative electromagnetic fields are used to stimulate the body's ability to heal.<br /> The bulk of the book is devoted to listing of 35 health conditions, complete with a description of causes and detailed instructions on using magnet therapy to prevent and heal each condition.  Health problems discussed include addictions, heart disease, diabetes, children's ailments, and reproductive organ diseases.<br /> \\"While magnet therapy may just now be gaining more widespread use and popularity in the United States and elsewhere, the use of magnetic energy for healing dates back thousands of years.\\"  Magnet Therapy provides all the information readers need to begin using this ancient technique to improve and maintain their health.	2003-05-04

Most people also don't have as much money as they think they should have or need; and those who have lots of money often find that they're still not happy.  Deborah L. Price addresses these problems in her latest book, Money Therapy.<br /> Price is a licensed investment advisor and stockbroker.  She is now a money coach consultant.  She has condensed her more than fifteen years experience into a process called money therapy.<br /> She explains that we are not meant to spend our lives shopping and working to pay off debt.  The purpose of her book, she says, is \\"to help you remember the purpose of your life: the original purpose.\\"  Money is only one of the many tools available for achieving that purpose.<br /> Price advises people to start building the life they want before they have money.  Too many people waste their lives waiting for money to come first, and are still unhappy if it does come.  She details how to build a strong foundation based on what you truly want from life, and then how to manifest the money needed to achieve your goals.<br /> Over the years, she's observed eight \\"money types,\\" based on how people feel about money.  These are the innocent, victim, warrior, martyr, fool, creator/artist, tyrant, and the money magician.  The money types are meant to be a \\"guide to discovering the impact of your past experiences with money and to changing your approach in the future.\\"  Price describes the weaknesses and strengths of each, and explains how people can turn themselves into money magicians who have all that they need and the ability to enjoy it.  She's included a simple quiz to help readers determine which type they are.<br /> She emphasizes throughout the book that the only real value that money has is the value we give to it.  Money itself is just pieces of paper.  We forget this, and attribute power to money.  This leads feeling out of control and making financial choices based on fear.<br /> Price has filled Money Therapy with advice on how to overcome negative and fearful feelings about money.

Later he retired from a long career as a mathematics professor and devoted himself to spiritual research.  He has lived and worked in dozens of countries.  He's written several books and conducts workshops internationally.<br /> Dr. Kumar defines Kundalini as a form of energy residing in every human.  For many people, it remains dormant.  In a few, it awakens spontaneously.  He says that \\"the awakening of Kundalini causes a transformation and transcendence in life.\\"  Kundalini that is awakened prematurely or incorrectly can be frightening, and in some cases, damaging.<br /> He explains how people need to prepare themselves for Kundalini, then details how people can work to arouse their sleeping serpents in a safe manner.  He calls his technique the \\"Integral Path,\\" which he says is \\"the shortest path to God.\\"<br /> As Kundalini is awakened, it rises through the chakras, which are energy centers located along the length of the spine.

Myers wrote Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death, people didn't believe they necessarily had souls, much less that the soul would survive their death.  After Myers experienced communication with his deceased wife, he set out to prove his contemporaries wrong.<br /> Myers was a scholar who became a scientist when he began investigating paranormal phenomena.  He conducted research and experiments in a variety of fields, including personality disintegration, genius, sleep, hypnosis, and trances.  His goal was to \\"break down that artificial wall between science and superstition.\\"  He believed that questions of the soul should be subjected to the same open mind and critical analysis used in other scientific inquiries.<br /> His landmark investigations set the standards for subsequent research into human consciousness.  In his interpretive introduction to the book, Jeffrey Mishlove says that Myers's \\"classic synthesis of nineteenth century field research [is regarded] as the most important single work in the history of psychical research.\\"  He adds that it is still \\"fresh, vigorous, and contemporary.\\"<br /> Like many of the classic metaphysical texts, Myers's book has been out of print for years.  Hampton Roads Publishing Company has begun to reissue the classical texts in their new series, Studies in Consciousness/Russell Targ Editions.  Their current edition of Myers's book is an abridgement of the original, \\"prepared to make its major content more readily accessible to the modern reader.\\"<br /> Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death documents Myers's extensive experiments and conclusions that personality does, in fact, continue after death.  Readers will discover that he achieved his goal of proving that the human personality is not limited to material life.	2003-04-11

Those toxins affect our bodies and may lead to serious illness.  At the least, they can reduce the quality of life by making us feel less than vibrant and healthy.<br /> Richard Leviton is a health journalist and author with more than twenty-five years experience.  The Healthy Living Space is his eighth book.<br /> In it, he offers \\"70 practical steps on how to use safe, proven, nontoxic, self-care methods drawn from the fields of natural and alternative medicine.\\"  Leviton not only explains how to detoxify, he also explains why.  He also emphasizes that it's important to detoxify both home and body, as the poisons accumulated in both can make you sick.<br /> He begins with an eye-opening inventory of substances most of us are exposed to every day.  He then describes some of the health symptoms people suffer.  Many of these symptoms can be vague or subtle, leading health-care professionals to either mis-diagnose or label sufferers as hypochondriacs.  Instead they need to be treated as early-warning signals of what may become severe health problems.<br /> Leviton says \\"the truth is that we are being slowly poisoned, because although the toxins are potent, we are rarely exposed to a lethal or even sub-lethal, but dangerous, dose.  We are instead routinely exposed to very small doses of many toxic chemicals, which together overwhelm our body's natural detoxification system.\\"  He says the key is to recognize that toxicity is occurring so slowly that most of us don't realize it until too late.<br /> Because few of us can entirely avoid all toxic substances, Leviton explains how we can reduce our exposure, while at the same time strengthening our body's ability to resist damage from the elements we are exposed to.  He includes chapters on emotional and spiritual detoxification as well as extensive information on physical detoxification.  The chapters on detoxifying homes describe how to remove common pollutants, as well as utilize the more esoteric techniques like feng shui.<br /> Whether we realize it or not, all of us know what it feels like to live in a toxic environment.

This is her eighth book.<br /> She presents her information in four major sections: dealing with anger at personal setbacks, at significant others, at children, and at colleagues.  Underlying everything is the concept that we all feel anger at one time or another.  It's how that anger is expressed, not the anger itself,  that can create problems.  Ford says that \\"while I know that we all have reasons to be angry, I can't think of one good reason to stay mad for very long.\\"  She distinguishes between \\"distorted anger, which tears families apart, and healthy anger, which keeps relationships thriving.\\"<br /> Ford emphasizes using anger to help in personal growth and offers myriad suggestions on how to make anger work for us.  She includes examples of how real people have learned to manage their anger.  The key is to recognize and deal with the anger as soon as it develops, before it grows into a major disturbance.  And contrary to what many people have been taught, repressing anger doesn't solve anything.<br /> Ford's suggestions and tips are practical and simple.  Most involve learning to recognize exactly what you're feeling, and then delving into what created that feeling.  After that, the underlying cause of the anger can be resolved.  Often, just recognizing what's happening frees us from negative reactions.<br /> She says that \\"sarcasm, manipulation, passive-aggressive acts, physical illness, depression, rebellion, and violence all result from the ability to express anger and resolve disputes.\\"  If any of these symptoms are a part of your life, then Getting Over Getting Mad will provide the information and tools you need to turn your anger from destructive emotion to healthy growth.If any of these symptoms are a part of your life, then Getting Over Getting Mad will provide the information and tools you need to turn your anger from destructive emotion to healthy growth.	2003-03-08

She describes a Universal Human as one who is connected through the heart to the whole of life, attuned to the deeper intelligence of nature, and called forth irresistibly by spirit to creatively express his or her gifts in the evolution of self and the world.<br /> She believes that humans today are undergoing the process of emerging from what weve been to beings capable of co-creating a new world that is sustainable, compassionate, and life-enhancing.  Our present generation has the technological ability to destroy the world, or to consciously evolve in ways that are magnificent beyond imaginings.<br /> She has divided her book into two parts.  The first section compares the process of emerging to physical birthgestation, infancy, childhood, youth, and mature adult.  She also discusses why this particular generation is the cross-over generation between human development to date and the Universal Human, and outlines the challenges we face in making the transition.<br /> The longer second section is a guidebook to emergence.  In it, Hubbard interweaves the story of her own emergence with meditations, spiritual practices, and encouragement.  She describes ten key steps, beginning with creating an inner sanctuary.  All the steps depend on knowing and listening to the Essential Self.<br /> Hubbard emphasizes that change is necessary if we are to survive, because the very behaviors that kept us alive in prior times are the behaviors that are threatening to end our lives today.

During this time, Demeter's joy allows the plants to again grow.  Traditionally, this has been the story of why we have winter and summer seasons.<br /> Virginia Beane Rutter has another interpretation of the ancient story.

Her first contact came during her teenage years, in the presence of her younger brother.  As an adult, she described this event to other researchers and learned that she wasn't alone in her experience.<br /> The standard practice for abduction experiences includes thorough medical examinations followed by hypnosis.  Conventional theory holds that abducted persons are \\"caused to suffer from an amnesia that hides their experiences from themselves and others.\\"  Hypnosis is necessary to uncover these hidden memories.<br /> Smith chose to not undergo hypnosis.  She decided to search within for the hidden memories.  She instructed her subconscious mind to reveal any abduction information to her in the form of dreams, with the intent of documenting the information.  Concurrent with this, she networked with others and conducted extensive research into the phenomenon of alien contact, applying her training as a respected scientist.<br /> Beginning in 1988, she began recording her dreams and possible interpretation of each, all memories that surfaced, and the results of her investigations.  As a result, she says that she's learned \\"the abduction scenario is real.  Nonhuman entities have been interacting with us for thousands of years and they will continue to interact with us.\\"<br />  Starting in 1990, she began a two-way interaction with the Visitors and learned that they find humans to be a fascinating species which they enjoy observing.  Smith maintains however, that the Visitors have gone beyond observing, into interbreeding with humans.  She also comments that the U.S. government regards itself as being at war with aliens, thus all the secrecy surrounding UFO's and abductions.<br /> \\"Offering the immediacy of freshly-lived experience, the precision of scientific reporting, and the high intrigue of top-notch mystery writing, Smith's real-life Diary of an Abduction is a riveting and provocative journey into the sky, into the soul, and beyond.\\"y of an Abduction is a riveting and provocative journey into the sky, into the soul, and beyond.\\"	2003-03-08

He's the founder of the therapy known as Process Oriented Psychology and has established training centers in 22 countries.  Dr. Mindell has appeared on TV and radio and at conferences worldwide.  He draws on his extensive experience and knowledge in his latest book, Dreaming While Awake: Techniques for 24-Hour Lucid Dreaming.<br /> In it, he explains that Dreaming (always with a capital letter) is \\"the energy behind everything; it is the life force of all living beings, the power of trees and plants, and the power of motors, business, and financial centers.\\"  While the dreaming we do at night has an important part in all this, Dreaming occurs 24 hours a day.  Dr. Mindell says that \\"the Dreaming is always present, like an aura shimmering around the objects and events you call everyday life.\\"<br /> His goal is to help readers \\"learn to move through and behind the world of everyday life, exploring the world of healing, divination, and immortality.\\"  He begins by defining Dreaming and discussing it in terms of religion, philosophy, and science.  He then explains how it enhances personal health (mental and physical), relationships, and work situations.<br /><br /> Dr. Mindell provides several simple exercises that individuals can use alone or with others to train themselves in becoming aware of the subtleties of Dreaming. He says that many people have an undefinable sense of something wrong or missing in their lives and says this is because they unwittingly are only seeing half their lives and half the world--they aren't accessing Dreaming.<br /> Dreaming While Awake is not a dream interpretation book.  Instead, it guides readers on a journey of recognition.  A hidden world of information exists, with clues provided by the unconscious on a continual basis.

Conventional interpretation relies on words to describe dream imagery, and often the words are terribly inadequate.  Dr. Mellick says \\"we can express dreams in the art form the best suits them, in the art form whose structure is most akin to their innate structure.\\"<br /> She then fully describes more than 50 ways to explore dreams, including painting, dance, sculpture, drawing, poetry, music, or any combination of these.  She explains several techniques for letting go of expectations and allowing the dream to guide the dreamer to the best form of expression.<br /><br /> Dr. Mellick also recognizes that many people don't have lots of time for working on their dreams.  For those with little time for reflection, she provides a chapter titled \\"Expressive Dream Work in Five Minutes.\\"  A companion chapter offers techniques for those who have as much as ten minutes a day for dream work.<br /> Not all dreams are pleasant.  She offers help also to those haunted by nightmares, including how to make a healing mandala.  She also discusses dreams in which a particular action or image is repeated.<br /> Although most of us prefer to work alone with our dreams, some people find it beneficial to form a dream work group.  Dr. Mellick provides guidelines for establishing a group and ensuring that it's beneficial to all participants.<br /> One fascinating exercise asks people to imagine life events as a dream.  The events can be ordinary activities.  She says that doing this offers a new perspective that can be helpful in understanding our lives.<br /> \\"The Art of Dreaming is an excellent resource and practical manual that inspires and amplifies self-discovery and understanding of the rich spiritual treasure and guidance that dreams provide.\\"	2003-02-09

He feels that regular meditation is essential, and explains how the energy generated by meditation can be used to activate life-giving forces.<br /> Perrin emphasizes that \\"a spiritual life denies us nothing, not family, friendships, business, leisure, success, nor any other of life's abundant treasures.  It just gives it all perspective.\\"  Living a spiritual life, however, is for many a step into the unknown, and he discusses the fears that can keep people from taking that step.<br /> He learned how to overcome his own fears and hesitations from Swami Rudrananda (Rudi) and has continued teaching those lessons to his own students.  Perrin says that everyone needs a teacher, but that a teacher or guru is just that, not someone to be worshiped.  True to ancient wisdom, when the student is ready, the teacher will appear.<br /> Perrin defines surrender as \\"a state of openness that carries us from moment to moment in life that allows us to let go of attachments and evolve to higher states of consciousness.\\"  He makes a clear distinction between rejection and surrender.  Surrender has nothing to do with walking away from the responsibilities of daily life.<br /> Perrin's teachings are based on several themes, including \\"total surrender to God, the development of the chakra system and awakening of the kundalini force,\\" and transformation.  A Deeper Surrender provides guidance needed for those desiring to lead a more spiritual life based on these themes.	2003-02-09

In it, she has collected inspiring stories from such luminaries as Pema Chodron, the Dalai Lama, and Thich Nhat Hanh, as well as from numerous others involved in spiritual growth.<br /> Bloom says that \\"compassion is universal,\\" and not a religious practice, but adds that \\"for most people, however, the development of compassion must necessarily start small, and the various Buddhist traditions have a richness of methods to cultivate loving-kindness in even the most intransigent of beings.\\"<br /> The stories she has included all serve to illustrate how compassion can change lives, including those of jailers engaging in torture,  thieves, and ordinary people facing the stresses of daily life.<br /> Bloom includes directions for two special meditation practices.  The first is \\"Metta,\\" or loving-kindness, which focuses on becoming calm, centered, and connected.  The second is a powerful practice named \\"Tonglen,\\" in which meditators \\"breathe in\\" the sufferings of others, and \\"breathe out\\" healing and love.

Together they set out to \\"interview\\" residents of the Other Side.<br /> Beyond Death is a compilation of those interviews.<br /><br /> Holzer says he is satisfied that their interviews represent \\"the first real account of the afterlife in specific and non-glamorous, non-religious terms, as if the communicator over there has simply moved to a `foreign country' and was reporting what it was like in every department of life.\\"<br /> Indeed, the afterlife does sound much like present life, but with a few key differences.  Residents of the Other Side have greater knowledge about their continuous existence and, in fact, chided Solomon and Holzer for using terms like death.<br /><br /> The communicators explained that time is measured much differently for them than it is on Earth, which is why some people wait years for contact from loved ones who have crossed over.<br /><br /> Basic personalities and abilities remain unchanged.  Thus entertainers, like Elvis, continue to entertain, if that's their desire.  All of the communicators emphasized that everyone can have, do, or be, whatever they want.  All they have to do is wish it, and it happens.  So if your greatest desire is material wealth, it's yours.  However, many found that, although they can have anything they want, their wants changed as they grew.  What it seemed important or desirable while on Earth may not be what's wanted most in the afterlife, especially after they've been there for awhile.<br /> Most of the interviews were with communicators residing in  the \\"second level.\\"  Some were ordinary people, and others were famous, like Princess Diana, Judy Garland, and Al Capone.<br /> One personality spoke from his place in the \\"first level, \\" where he seemed quite pleased with his life of debauchery and violence.<br /> Many levels exist beyond the first few levels.

Lee Cowden, M.D., who is board-certified in internal medicine, cardiovascular disease, and clinical nutrition, joined forces with Burton Goldberg, author of numerous books on alternative medicine, to write Cancer Diagnosis:  What To Do Next.<br /> Many people don't know where to turn for information when diagnosed with cancer.  And the answers they often get from medical professionals include few options.  Lack of knowledge causes many people to undergo treatments they don't want.<br />Goldberg says that \\"there is no single magic bullet cure for cancer.  Many factors contribute to the development of cancer and many modalities and substances must be used to reverse it.\\"<br /> The authors emphasize that never giving up hope is a critical first step in cancer treatment, no matter what therapy is chosen.  They then outline some positive steps that patients can take that will help them chose the therapy that's best for them.  Included in this section is a simple test that reveals whether a tumor will respond to chemotherapy, and if so, what the smallest effective dosage is.<br /> They also discuss the causes of cancer, and offer suggestions for prevention and early detection.  They provide complete information about testing methods used by alternative practitioners that aid in developing effective treatment plans.<br /> Nutrition plays a big role both in prevention and treatment of cancer, and the authors explain how to choose the best diet for you.  They also explain the role of supplements, such as vitamins and minerals, in strengthening the body.<br /> Herbs and other nontoxic therapies can be very helpful for many people.  All the details are included, as well as complete information on techniques for stimulating the immune system.  Detoxification and energy therapies are also explained.<br />Detoxification is especially important because of all the pollutants in our air, water, and food.  According to the authors, \\"most conventional doctors do not take these factors into consideration when treating cancer.\\"<br /> Each chapter includes \\"Quick Definitions,\\" which are explanations of medical terms, in the margins, making it easy to understand the text.

She's written numerous book and leads workshops internationally.  Her latest book, Creating True Prosperity, teaches that the way to happiness is not necessarily the accumulation of wealth.<br /> Gawain defines prosperity as \\"the experience of having plenty of what we truly need and want in life, material and otherwise.\\"  She adds that \\"the key point to understand is that prosperity is an internal experience, not an external state, and it is an experience that is not tied to money.\\"  This is one reason why many people find themselves unhappy, despite the fact that they have more than enough money to cover their needs.<br /> This does not mean that money is unimportant, and a certain amount of it is obviously needed to meet basic survival needs.  The difficulty for many people comes from how they think about money.  Gawain says that \\"essentially, money is a symbol for energy.\\"  We use our energy in a certain way--work--and receive money in exchange.  We can then exchange our money for something created by someone else's energy.  This defines money as a flow of energy and \\"our financial affairs tend to reflect how our life energy is moving.\\"<br /> Prosperity eludes many of us for a variety of reasons.  Gawain provides some exercises for understanding personal patterns and overcoming habits and thought processes that keep individuals from achieving their prosperity goals.  From this, she gets into a discussion of polarities and how most of us feel that we must always choose between opposites, with neither choice providing happiness.  She details six steps that help individuals to balance their own inner polarities.<br /> Gawain then answers common questions that readers might have, such as where to begin when needs seem overwhelming and how to overcome a \\"not enough\\" mentality.  She finishes with a chapter of \\"stories of prosperity,\\" filled with examples of how everyday people have created prosperous lives.<br /> Creating True Prosperity is for every person wanting guidance in identifying \\"where they need more balance in their lives, freeing them to pursue fulfilling relationships and personal satisfaction.\\"prosperous lives.<br /> Creating True Prosperity is for every person wanting guidance in identifying \\"where they need more balance in their lives, freeing them to pursue fulfilling relationships and personal satisfaction.\\"	2003-02-09

Essential to good health at any stage of life is \\"flow,\\" that is, the ability of \\"substances and energies [to] continually and adroitly find their ways into and out of living organisms.\\"  In humans, this includes processes like digestion and menstruation.

Central to understanding Vivaxis is acknowledgment of the Earth as a living being with its own energy fields.  Earth, and human, energy is affected by the other planets as well as the sun and the moon.  Dr. Jacka explains how receptors on the human body, many of which lie on the meridians established centuries ago by acupuncturists, receive and process all energy.

Lerner, who holds degrees in philosophy and psychology, says emancipatory spirituality involves regaining our awe and wonder at the universe and reconnecting with Spirit.<br /> He maintains that people are seeking spiritual meaning in their lives, but the world we live in today discourages openness about spiritual matters.  People are torn by conflict between what they privately know is right, and the way they're forced to abandon that in their public lives, in order to be &quot;successful.&quot;  Thinking only in terms of the &quot;bottom line&quot; has led to destructive behavior, individually, socially, and environmentally.<br /> Lerner describes a new kind of bottom line, where love and caring are the measure of success.  Although spirituality can be incorporated into every aspect of a society, he goes into great detail with his vision of how medicine, education, and the law would function in a spiritually-based world.<br /> The world we live in is determined by the choices we make.  Most people feel that, given the opportunity to do so, they would make spiritually responsible choices, but they can't, because other people can't be trusted to do the same.  Lerner says &quot;the more we trust each other and the universe . . . the more we will make the world safe for Spirit.  And the safer it feels, the more people will start to come out of their own closets and acknowledge their deep hunger for a spiritually grounded life.&quot;<br /> Lerner doesn't just offer his vision of a more spiritual world--he includes some practical suggestions for what people can start doing right now to get involved and help heal their lives and transform their communities.<br /> Regardless of their religious beliefs, Spirit Matters will help all readers achieve a deeper spiritual understanding that &quot;can bring you both a deeper fulfillment in your life and, at the same time, a deeper connection to the central challenges facing our planet.&quot;  Buy two copies--one for yourself, and one for sharing.

Why do those followers stay with them, even to the point of self-destruction?<br /> In Rogue Messiahs: Tales of Self-Proclaimed Saviors, Colin Wilson analyzes the lives of more than two dozen individuals responsible for the destruction or death of hundreds of loyal disciples.  He also includes interviews with the ordinary people who got caught up in believing whatever the self-proclaimed messiahs taught.<br /> Wilson has published more than eighty books, on a wide range of subjects, and is generally regarded as one of the most erudite and well-informed authors of our time.<br /> He says that, \\"to begin with, we have to recognize that these 'messiahs' are driven by two basic human needs, power and sex.\\"  He goes on to explain that virtually all humans have these same needs, but in the messiahs, the needs have exploded beyond normal limits.  The messiahs generally start out well-intentioned, and may even help some people in their early years.  But they \\"cross the line from inspiration to paranoia, and from teaching to killing--genuine aspiration mixed with self-deception.\\"<br /> Wilson also discusses fact that five percent of the members in any group are dominant individuals.  Five percent of the dominant members are \\"so dominant that they automatically become leaders of every group.\\"  Of this last group, a very small percentage are geniuses or become great leaders.  The remaining dominant individuals \\"are obsessed by their personality, and the impact it makes on other people.\\"  It's from this group that the rogue messiahs are drawn.  Not only are they dominant individuals, they require others to acknowledge their dominance.<br /> Most of the people drawn into the webs woven by the messiahs believe they're following an idea.  Wilson says that \\"all human beings long for powerful conviction, for ideas that seem to offer them a new and more meaningful way of life.\\"  Once they accept the ideas promulgated by the leaders, they find it difficult, if not impossible, to break away from the group.<br /> In counterpoint, Wilson also analyzes the personalities of dominant individuals \\"whose dispositions led instead to spiritual insights of great benefit to humankind and continue to influence our lives today,\\" and deftly shows how the same basic traits can be turned to either good or evil.<br /> Readers interested in the workings of the human mind will find Rogue Messiahs fascinating and insightful.

She uses a practical, problem-oriented approach, explaining &quot;how the cards can suggest courses of action, attitudes to take, and other things we can do to help with some of the common questions that come up in our lives.&quot;<br /> She first describes the kinds of questions that might be asked, saying that if you don't have a specific problem, you can always ask for advice on how to improve your life.  She offers general instructions on how to lay out and interpret the cards.<br /> The bulk of the book is devoted to describing the individual cards and their potential meanings and interpretations.  Renee provides enough information that readers can understand the advice the cards are offering, regardless of their individual situations.  She explains, however, that nothing bad will happen if a person doesn't take the cards' advice.  She says the cards &quot;are entirely neutral and have no good or bad, positive or negative associations, since they merely suggest things you can do, and not things that are going to happen to you.&quot;<br /> Many factors go into making decisions and sometimes we need help in sorting the relevant date from the non-relevant.

Women who become the second wives of previously married men find themselves facing special problems and adjustments.

Although each woman's story is unique, Barash was able to divide them into twelve general categories, such as women dealing with a vengeful first wife, women coping with stepchildren, and women with less life experience than their husbands.<br /> She devotes a chapter to each of the categories.  The chapters are filled with stories from women describing the particular problems they faced and how they dealt with them.  Some women forged successful marriages, and some did not.  Many are still struggling.  Each chapter also includes helpful advice and commentary from numerous experts.<br /> Women contemplating marrying a man who has been divorced or widowed will find that Second Wives will help prepare them for the challenges ahead.

His book is intended to show \\"how the Christian spiritual tradition both complements and completes the work of the psychologists.\\"<br /> He begins with a discussion of the Kingdom of Heaven, pointing out that it's the highest level of consciousness to which humans can aspire, not just a place where people go after death.

They sponsor talks in medical schools, providing free meals and medical supplies to students.  They also fund most of the medical research going on today and keep doctors' offices supplied with \\"free\\" samples.  Between drug companies and the pressures put doctors by HMO's, it's no wonder that most people who go to see a doctor walk away with a prescription to be filled.<br /> Sometimes those prescriptions are essential, particularly in the cases of sudden, acute illnesses.  But often they do more harm than good.  Mindell and Hopkins's goal is to \\"teach you how to be a knowledgeable and conservative drug user, who knows how to ask the right questions and get the necessary information to stay healthy.\\"<br /> They explain that nearly one million people are \\"injured\\" by drugs every year, and \\"at least 11 million people are abusing prescription drugs.\\"  They caution that having FDA approval doesn't mean a drug is safe, reminding readers that \\"those FDA-approved drugs are killing at least 140,000 people a year, just in hospitals.\\"<br /> The bulk of the book is a detailed listing of hundreds of drugs prescribed every day, including those for heart disease, digestive disorders, asthma and allergies, pain relief, diabetes, insomnia, prostate problems, osteoporosis, eye diseases, and herpes.

Medicine that does not rely on modern technology is referred to as alternative medicine.  Alternative medicine has a history as old as mankind.<br /> Why then did modern medical techniques become favored over time-tested and traditional methods?  Richard Leviton presents some startling answers to this in his comprehensive and fascinating new book, Physician.<br /> Leviton explores &quot;the consequences to the human body, mind, and spirit of medical treatment under one or the other medical approach.&quot;  He concludes that &quot;conventional medicine operates in a way contrary to spiritual unfolding and at this point in Western history is a prime obstacle to healthy human soul life.&quot;<br /> He's not condemning individual doctors, but rather the current system of allowing business interests and politics to dictate medical policy.  Medical care today is a trillion dollar business, and it's a business protected from competition and free choice.  He says that &quot;freedom of choice is available in most areas of American life except medicine.&quot;<br /> Leviton further says that the struggle between conventional and alternative practices is  only part of deeper battle for control of the human soul.  In discussing this, he delves into the environment, philosophy, karma, emotions, the real reasons for illness, and spiritual growth.  He includes quotes, statistics, and research to document his assertions.<br /> The author of six previous books, Leviton is widely respected in the field of alternative medicine and natural health journalism.  When reading Physician, &quot;be prepared to take a much larger view of life than one would expect in a discussion of medicine.&quot;  Readers who do so will learn what, and why, constitutes good health care for their body, mind, and spirit.	2002-11-28

Veterinarians, who generally receive minimal instruction in nutrition, also recommend feeding only commercial animal food.  CJ Puotinen disputes this advice in her latest book, Natural Remedies for Dogs and Cats.<br /> She's interviewed dozens of holistic pet care experts and studied all the available research on pet care.  Time and time again, the evidence points to commercial pet foods as the source of chronic health problems in animals.<br /> If left to themselves, dogs and cats eat raw prey that they have caught.  This gives them a variety of food and nutrients.  Even if prepared foods could imitate the variety, which they don't, the processing they undergo destroys the nutrients.  Additionally, commercial pet foods contain a host of unhealthy products.<br /> Puotinen describes the best diets for dogs and cats, and then explains how to achieve that.  She even includes some recipes.<br /> The second section of the book is devoted to natural remedies for ailing animals.  She describes the basic nutrients needed by all animals--our pets need vitamins and minerals, just as we do--and how to best include them in a healthy diet.  She then explains how various herbs are used in achieving and maintaining pet health.

Younger men like the fact that most mature women know who they are and what they want--they have a strong sense of identity.  Unlike older men, younger men have grown up in a culture that encourages self-awareness and emotional expression--they realize their role in a relationship is more than providing economic stability.

He meets a militant female environmentalist, and begins learning of some of the politics involved in water rights.  He also learns that perhaps the celibate life isn't right for him after all.<br /> A group of land developers with the philosophy that \\"any day is a good day to make money\\" are also looking at the water.  They draw up a proposal for a gambling casino, replete with promises of economic security.  Buried in the fine print are the clauses handing over all water rights.<br /> A former real estate developer himself, Booker recognizes the true impact of the casino on the People.  He explains this to the tribal elders, who say they will \\"continue to pray and seek a vision.\\"  Booker and the young woman are seriously injured in a car accident, from which it takes months to recover.  The developers move ahead unhampered with their plans.<br /> Dead Water Rites \\"is lucid and literary, an articulate and artful plea to cease our self-destructive exploitation of the environment and native people.\\"  Those who read it will gain a new respect for the liquid essential to all life on Earth, and a better understanding of those who seek to keep it alive.	2002-10-27

Most people know that bad breath, indigestion, hiatal hernias, and Crohn's Disease are related to what happens in the digestive tract.  Clinical nutritionist Elizabeth Lipski, M.S., C.C.N., also includes arthritis, autism, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, and schizophrenia in the list of digestion-related ailments.<br /><br /> Lipski cites all the latest research and studies on digestive disorders and therapies in her new book,  Digestive Wellness, Updated Second Edition.<br /> Digestion begins in the mouth and continues through the stomach and intestines to the colon.  Each organ has an important role to play in helping the body break down foods so that their nutrients can be absorbed.  Lipski says that &quot;most of us don't think much about digestion unless it isn't working well,&quot; adding that &quot;many people with chronic digestive problems continue to eat poorly, never realizing that their food choices are causing their ill health.&quot;<br /> She starts with an exploration of the causes of digestive illness, which is often related to lifestyle choices.  She then describes how a healthy digestive system works, and explains  where and how the process can get out of balance.  Lipski also includes information on how to pinpoint the source of your particular digestive disorder and provides recommendations and therapies for restoring wellness.<br /> She emphasizes that each person has different biochemistry, and that what works for one will not work for another.  Although health professionals can order lab tests (and she explains these tests fully), healing usually involves modifying individual eating habits.  Accordingly, Lipski devotes one section to self-care strategies, with the intent of exposing readers to &quot;more plans, new ideas, and the tools to be your own health expert.&quot;<br /> She ends with a resource list of nutrition experts, health professionals, laboratories, and suggested reading.<br /> Lipski says that Digestive Wellness &quot;is about taking control of your lifestyle to increase your chances of getting healthier and more vibrant each year.&quot;  It's an excellent resource for everyone suffering from any kind of digestive disorder and those who care about them.he ends with a resource list of nutrition experts, health professionals, laboratories, and suggested reading.<br /> Lipski says that Digestive Wellness &quot;is about taking control of your lifestyle to increase your chances of getting healthier and more vibrant each year.&quot;  It's an excellent resource for everyone suffering from any kind of digestive disorder and those who care about them.	2002-10-27

She says that the novel came to her in a &quot;burst of inspiration.&quot;<br /> The book is presented as a journal written by &quot;Yeshua the Nazarene.&quot;  He is a student at the School for Initiates and is required to write an account of his life before he can graduate.<br /> He begins when he was twelve years old and traveled to Jerusalem with his parents, Yosef and Miryam, for his bar mitzvah.  He then records the details of meeting Rabbi Hillel, the first of his many teachers.  He spends the next fourteen years traveling and studying with great teachers from Egypt, Palestine, Persia, India, and Tibet.  Along with his travels, Yeshua chronicles his inner journeys, and his unswerving devotion to God.<br /> Finally, when he's twenty-nine years old, he's ready to graduate.  Not only has he completed his journal, he's accomplished the one task the other Initiates are afraid to even try--he's raised himself from the dead.  The priests honor him with an elaborate ceremony in which he is Christed.<br /> Moments later, they all turn against him and he flees for his life.  The reason?  When asked to declare his life's work, Yeshua replies, &quot;my chosen mission is to make known to all men all mysteries now separating them from God.&quot;  He wanted people to have a direct relationship with God, and not have to rely on intermediaries.<br /> Yeshua is, of course, the man we know as Jesus Christ.<br /> &quot;Pevehouse has written a powerful, radically new story of the 'lost years' of Jesus. . .[giving] us a rich portrait of the inner life of Western culture's pivotal figure.&quot;  Readers will find I, The Christ interesting and informative.	2002-10-27

Accordingly, the first section of their latest book is devoted to &quot;the process of bringing your heart and your head into balance to make loving choices.&quot;<br /> This involves recognizing and accepting your feelings.  They provide extensive guidance and examples for doing their &quot;self-encounter&quot; exercise.  Self encounters provide a way to communicate honestly and skillfully with yourself.  Fisher and Hart emphasize the importance of this, saying that &quot;you cannot effectively communicate with another until you are clear about what's going on inside yourself and what it is you are trying to communicate.&quot;<br /> Once people learn to communicate with themselves, they are ready for the &quot;Healing Encounter,&quot; where they practice communicating with others.  Many conflicts with others are rooted in power struggles.  Fisher and Hart describe how people can recognize and defuse the internal conflicts leading to power struggles.  They also explain the importance of internal and external boundaries in relationships and offer guidance on forming appropriate boundaries.<br /><br /> The authors say that &quot;we tend to create relationships like the ones we observed in childhood, yet most of us don't want that kind of relationship.&quot;  They explain how to determine the extent to which you're influenced by your early observations and experience, and how you can use that information to build the kind of relationship that your truly want now.<br /> Relationships are meant to be teachers and to assist in our personal growth.

She shares her experiences in Choosing Waterbirth, a book filled with practical advice and encouragement.<br /> Bertram knew from the beginning that she wanted home births, maintaining that \\"most births do not actually require doctors or hospitals or fetal monitors or forceps or episiotomies or drugs.\\"  She researched birthing methods carefully, learning about water birth shortly before her first child was born.  She learned that not only did water make birthing easier and less painful for the mother, it also provided \\"a kind, loving, and gentle entry into this world\\" for the baby.<br /> In water birth, the mother immerses her lower body in a tub of water heated to body temperature.  The baby is born into the water.  The baby continues to receive oxygen from the umbilical cord.  It is then brought gently to the surface and handed to the mother.  Babies will not try to breathe until the air hits their faces and are in no danger of drowning.<br /> Bertram emphasizes that giving birth is a natural process for women and that, if left to their intuition, they have the ability to deliver healthy babies.  Having a baby does not have to the overwhelming and frightening experience that modern methods have led women to believe.  She provides lots of encouragement for women who want home births, even if they choose not to have a water birth.  Alternatively some hospitals and birthing centers have water birth facilities available.  Each woman must do what she feels is best for her and her baby.<br /> For those who do choose waterbirth, Bertram provides a wealth of information on where to find birthing tubs (she purchased her first one at an animal feed store!), midwives and other attendants, and birthing centers.  She also details exactly the things to expect about birth in general, and water birth in particular.<br /> A long time yoga practitioner and certified instructor, Bertram includes a section on how expectant mothers may use yoga for relaxation and for strengthening and stretching the muscles that will be used during childbirth.  The detailed instructions are accompanied by pictures.<br /> The final section of the book is entitled \\"Practice,\\" and in it Bertram has included pictures of her \\"water babies\\" and notes from her journals on their births. She says she hopes \\"to give women a different view of what birth can be.\\"  Her experiences helped make childbirth \\"a part of the joy of having children instead of a traumatic ordeal that had to be gone through in order to get children.\\"<br /> Sandra McLanahan, M.D. , in a preface to Choosing Waterbirth says \\"Lakshmi's book provides inspiration and support for women to learn to turn away from excess interventions, to return to the innate wisdom of the body and its natural resources.\\"  Every woman contemplating pregnancy, whether interested in water birth or not, will find a wealth of information and encouragement in Bertram's book.pectant mothers may use yoga for relaxation and for strengthening and stretching the muscles that will be used during childbirth.

Once you've done that, you're ready to begin--she says that the &quot;possibilities are endless as to how you can use your altar.&quot;  She provides suggestions for using money, blessing newborns, and general healing.

Symptoms include, but are not limited to, digestive difficulties, food allergies, joint pain, fatigue, and depression.  Candida albicans, the medical name for culprit in  most yeast infections, lives in everyone.  A number of factors, usually related to lifestyle and eating habits, can allow it to multiply out of control, creating serious problems for its human host.<br /> Although a medical professional can diagnose a yeast infection, it's usually up to the individual to get his/her body back into balance.  The Candida Albicans Yeast-Free Cookbook, Updated Second Edition, by nutritionist Pat Connolly, provides all the information individuals need to restore themselves to good health.<br /> Although it says &quot;yeast-free&quot; in the title, that doesn't mean that the recipes are prepared without yeast.  Unfortunately it's not that simple.  Yeast thrive on sugar, and the recipes are designed to eliminate sugar from diets, making the individual &quot;yeast-free.&quot;<br /> The basis of a sugar-free diet is the &quot;Rainbow Meal Plan,&quot; developed by a team of doctors.  The Rainbow Meal Plan is very simple:  each meal &quot;includes small portions of seven food groups:  complete protein; grain or legume; root vegetable; yellow or white vegetable; green vegetable; red, orange, or purple vegetable; and leafy green vegetable.&quot;  The portions are all the same size.  Individuals may eat as many meals a day as they like, but each meal must contain equal-sized portions of each of the seven food groups.<br /> Connolly provides some sample menus to help people get started on the plan.  He has also provided a selection of recipes for a  &quot;Modified Food Plan&quot; for those who are unable to use the Rainbow Plan.  Most of the recipes are very simple and use easy-to-find ingredients.<br /><br /> He also includes tips on eating out, good nutrition, hidden sugars, and foods to avoid under all circumstances.<br /> A comprehensive questionnaire at the beginning of the book will help those who suspect they may have a yeast overgrowth.<br /> The Candida Albicans Yeast-Free Cookbook offers hope and practical help to all those suffering from yeast infections.br /> A comprehensive questionnaire at the beginning of the book will help those who suspect they may have a yeast overgrowth. <br /> The Candida Albicans Yeast-Free Cookbook offers hope and practical help to all those suffering from yeast infections.	2002-10-13

Neale Donald Walsch and Nancy Fleming-Walsch have shared their thoughts on love and marriage as well as the vows they wrote for their wedding.<br /> Additionally, they've included essays from Marianne Williamson and Gerald Jamplosky, both well-known for their writings on the nature of love.<br /> When they decided to marry, the Walschs searched for vows they could repeat that reflected their true feelings for each other.  Finding none, they wrote their own.  Because they believe that &quot;no one can really promise anything with a 100 percent guarantee,&quot; they chose to make &quot;Statements of Intention.&quot;<br /><br /> On an impulse, Neale included the statements in Conversations With God, Volume 3 &quot;as an example of how a spirit-centered, freedom-granting marriage ceremony might be created.&quot;  Readers loved them and began using them in their own wedding ceremonies.<br /> The Wedding Vows From Conversations With God &quot;will serve to remind spouses and partners of their commitment to love and treat each other as equals always.&quot;  It's an ideal gift for lovers planning their wedding, for those wishing to renew their vows, or for &quot;those in whom, by sharing it with one another, love is each day reborn.&quot;	2002-09-16

He calls this the &quot;core insight,&quot; and he has devoted his book to explaining how each person can use this insight to balance and enrich their lives.<br /> He starts with an explanation of how to let go of physical tension and worry, so that healing energy is free to flow throughout the body.  He then moves to the mind, emphasizing that &quot;the body and mind are not separate.&quot;  What affects one also affects the other.  After that he discusses ways to waken spirituality, followed by creating harmonious relationships.  He says that &quot;people struggle with their relationships so often because they don't really know themselves.  Relationships are relatively effortless when you know who you are, when you are inwardly free.&quot;<br /> Dreaver finishes with chapters discussing work and money.  Contrary to what many people believe, it isn't necessary to give up material pleasures in order to be spiritually rich.  He says that &quot;a spirituality that is divorced from the social and economic realities of our age doesn't serve anyone,&quot; warning however that &quot;if your spiritual well-being depends on how much money you have, you're not free.&quot;  Money is like everything else--it needs to be in balance with life.<br /> What he wants people to understand, Dreaver says, is &quot;that you are not your thoughts, emotions, beliefs, personal history--nor are you your work.  It is this understanding that will set you free and allow you to move in the world . . . without stress, with genuine ease and balance.&quot;  In The Way of Harmony, he provides practical guidelines to achieve that understanding and balance.w you to move in the world . . . without stress, with genuine ease and balance.&quot;  In The Way of Harmony, he provides practical guidelines to achieve that understanding and balance.	2002-09-16

The second book by David Cumes, M.D., it blends science and shamanistic traditions with the intention of helping readers &quot;gain a greater understanding of the elements of health.&quot;  Balancing  body and spirit is essential for true healing, according to Dr. Cumes.<br /> Trained as a surgeon, he has taught at Stanford Medical Center as well as maintained a private practice.  But that's only one facet:  Dr. Cumes is also a wilderness traveler.  He founded Inward Bound and leads people on healing journeys through primitive areas.  He has studied the healing practices of indigenous people all over the world, and discovered what he calls a core belief of all healing techniques.  He says &quot;this core belief of balancing the opposites to achieve equilibrium has been known for ages&quot; and warns against putting it aside in favor of technology.<br /> Dr. Cumes says that &quot;all healing involves four factors:  the healer, the patient, the place where healing occurs, and the presence of a universal Field that embraces both healer and patient.&quot;  He discusses each of these factors in detail, delving into such areas as the wounded physician, archetypal forces, shamanism, and the search for Self.<br /><br /> He links the four factors to the traditional Tree of Life, and from that, developed what he calls the &quot;Tree of Health&quot; to help guide patients and their physicians in centering or balancing themselves.  Dr. Cumes says that &quot;balance and equilibrium result in inner peace and harmony and support the Inner Healer,&quot; adding that &quot;ultimately, health is about balance and inner harmony.&quot;<br /> Dr. Cumes says his book &quot;is a personal journey taken in an attempt to better understand different healing mechanisms and traditions.&quot;  Readers will find that The Spirit of Healing also provides an essential  roadmap in their own journey in search of their Inner Healer.ind that The Spirit of Healing also provides an essential  roadmap in their own journey in search of their Inner Healer.	2002-08-31

Shebaka initiated contact with McMahon in 1981.<br /> Volume 1 explains that \\"we are all spirit beings who happen to be on a human journey for a short while.\\"  It also includes directions for contacting spirit guides for assistance.  Volume 2 explores \\"the practicalities of spirit guides in our daily lives\\" and discusses day-to-day issues like sex, love, religion, and death.  While the books do stand alone, readers will benefit the most by reading the first volume before the second one.<br /> Shebaka starts Volume 2 with the insight that \\"a person is what he thinks, not what he thinks he is. . . Every physical human condition, without exception, is subject to restriction.  But a person's thoughts are exclusively his own.\\"  He advises that the only true freedom comes removing constraints against your thoughts.<br /> He goes on to say that \\"there is no evil, only apparent evil.\\"  He says this is because all souls are a part of God, and it is impossible for us to lose our divine nature, even though we may temporarily forget our divinity while on Earth.  He emphasizes that God is not something outside of us, but within us.  It's not necessary to reject any part of our material selves to know and accept God.<br /> In addition to good and evil, Shebaka discusses many other aspects of human life, including time and space,  fear, Karma, schizophrenia, abuse, forgiveness, prayers, soul mates, sex, politics, religion, money, and Atlantis.  He also paints a picture of utopian life on Earth in the future.  He concludes with the observation that \\"maybe you're in an interim state which is, at times, somewhat confusing and things get on top of you sometimes.  But don't forget that there's always somebody to hold your hand; not to walk for you, but to help you to walk.\\"  All you have to do is ask, and help is yours.<br /> The Grand Design is \\"a simply stated, user-friendly guide to living in the universe.\\"  Readers will find that they refer to both volumes repeatedly for loving guidance and wisdom.lk.\\"  All you have to do is ask, and help is yours.<br /> The Grand Design is \\"a simply stated, user-friendly guide to living in the universe.\\"  Readers will find that they refer to both volumes repeatedly for loving guidance and wisdom.	2002-08-31

His latest release is The Little Book of Letting Go: A Revolutionary 30-Day Program to Cleanse Your Mind, Lift Your Spirit and Replenish Your Soul.<br /> He says that &quot;failure to let go can eat up every small chance we have to be happy,&quot; and he filled his book with &quot;releases,&quot; which are simple exercises for letting go.  The releases first bring into awareness what isn't being held on to, and then shows how to let it go.  None of them require any tools or equipment other than a willing mind.  He begins with an exercise on &quot;letting go of the fear of letting go.&quot;<br /> Other releases cover mental pollutants, emotional fixation, misery, control, inner conflicts, negative honesty, the ego mind, and spiritual specialness.<br /> Prather emphasizes the role of thought and provides suggestions for identifying the ones that can trigger negative emotions.  He calls these the &quot;T-thoughts.&quot;  The releases are designed to help you let go of the T-thoughts and unclutter your mind.  While simple to do, the releases are exceptionally powerful and most are immediately effective.  Readers can do the releases in the order presented, or pick and choose among them.<br /> &quot;There are only three things you need to let go of,&quot; Prather says, &quot;judging, controlling, and being right.  Release these three and you will have the whole mind and twinkly heart of a child.&quot;  He combines humor and real-life stories with straight-forward and easy-to read writing to help readers release the thoughts that have kept them from wholeness and happiness.

Volume 1 focuses on explaining that &quot;life on Earth is a learning experience aimed at growth in awareness.  Each soul has free will to choose how it will live its life.&quot;<br /> Through McMahon, Shebaka describes how each soul is a part of God, and how a few souls lost awareness of this.  The Grand Design is not only the name of the book, it's also the description of the plan of how each soul will eventually regain what it lost.  The plan is infinitely flexible, due to the nature of free will.<br /> Each soul on Earth has spirit guides who help it become aware of its purpose on Earth.  When souls shed their physical bodies and return to spirit, their guides help them decide whether or not to return to Earth in another body.  Guides only offer counsel--souls are always free to do whatever they want.  Each soul will, however, eventually be reunited with all other souls.  No soul will be lost for eternity.<br /> Shebaka provides simple instructions for contacting spirit guides and asking for their help.  Although now a member of the spirit world, Shebaka lived through many Earthly lifetimes until he grew and evolved into higher awareness.  He says that &quot;it is my intention to provide an understanding of the whole scheme of life with suggestions as to how to derive as much benefit as possible from life on Earth.&quot;<br /> Volume 1 is divided into several parts, covering such topics as &quot;who made the world,&quot; letting go, religion, evolutionary growth, free will, feeling and emotion, dreams, mind control, the &quot;oversoul,&quot; time and space, and reincarnation.<br /> The Grand Design &quot;aims to celebrate the existence of an infinite, all-comprehending, cooperative chain of love linking all souls together.&quot;  The plan manifests itself in our daily lives.

Cohen, E.D.D., presents six steps for &quot;banishing bad habits, addictions, and negative thoughts, in his book, Snap Out of It!.  Dr. Cohen bases his steps on information learned in more than twenty-five years as a practicing psychotherapist.  He's also a certified family and marriage therapist and an expert in stress management.<br /> Dr. Cohen says that &quot;one of the great truths I have found is that human beings can change.&quot;  He admits that change can be difficult, but we all have the potential to make successful changes in our lives.  Change is easier when it can be broken into smaller steps, allowing us to feel success as we progress.  His steps are based on a process called &quot;thought-stopping,&quot; a technique that's been in use since 1958.<br /> He says the first step is to decide what you want to change, and he very strongly recommends changing only one habit at a time.  He offers a questionnaire that will help with clarifying just what your goal is and determining reasonable changes.  It never works if you're trying to follow someone else's goal.  That is, if your goal is to quit smoking, it must be because you really want to do so and not because someone else wants you to.<br /> Dr. Cohen provides an elastic band with his book, and his next steps involve wearing the band on your wrist.  Whenever you find yourself doing whatever it is that you've decided you no longer want to do, you snap the band while telling yourself &quot;No!&quot;  That's called thought-stopping.<br /> The next step is to learn to relax, because changing your behavior can be stressful.  Then while relaxed, you engage in some positive self-talk.  Dr. Cohen provides several examples of how negative thoughts can be made more positive, saying that sometimes it can be as easy as changing the way the thought is phrased.<br /> Dr. Cohen says that people are often resistant to change, because on one level, they're comfortable with the way they've always been.  The best way to overcome that resistance is to have a clear and simple plan.  Snap Out of  It! presents six easy steps that readers can use successfully to make the self-improvement changes they desire.t way to overcome that resistance is to have a clear and simple plan.

Although he is a Buddhist, he emphasizes that &quot;there are no belief systems or dogma attached to Reiki.&quot;  It's a tool that can be used for physical healing, or spiritual growth, depending upon individual needs.<br /> Vennells describes how Reiki was introduced to the Western world, offering brief biographies of the key Masters.  He then explains how people can learn Reiki--it's taught personally by a Master to students--focusing on First Degree Reiki.  This is the beginning level, and can be quickly learned.  Those with First Degree certificates are able to use Reiki for self-treatment and basic healing of others.<br /><br /> He offers numerous suggestions in which Reiki may be used in healing.  The twelve basic positions for the hands are described and illustrated.  He also explains how Reiki may be used for healing at a distance.  Additionally, Vennells provides guidelines for those who plan to go into professional practice.<br /><br /> As well as the actual physical aspects of Reiki, Vennells discusses the five principles, which include &quot;be grateful today&quot; and &quot;be kind to others today,&quot; and how to integrate them into daily practice.  He talks about the causes and nature of disease, including karma.  One chapter includes stories from other practitioners about how they've used Reiki to heal themselves, friends, and clients.  He finishes with meditations and visualizations.<br /> An appendix lists sources for finding a Master and various Reiki groups.

Dietmar Kramer, a licensed naturopath, has experimented successfully with applying the remedies directly on the skin.  The remedies don't work if simply applied indiscriminately.  Kramer and his associates have developed detailed body maps indicating where to apply which remedies for best results.<br /> New Bach Flower Body Maps presents the results of their research, a companion to his earlier volume, New Bach Flower Therapies.  It includes clear and concise diagrams of the 242 areas of the body where the remedies should be applied, along with simple instructions for making compresses and lotions.<br /> Kramer wrote both volumes because &quot;new therapeutic consequences, resulting from our practical work with the patient and an intuitive approach, have opened entirely new possibilities for Bach Flower Therapy in both diagnosis and application.&quot;<br /> Flower Therapy is based on the premise that negative emotional states manifest as physical illnesses.  The Flower remedies are a non-invasive way to treat the underlying causes of disease.  Therapists in the past have relied on extensive patient interviews to determine which remedy to use.<br /> Kramer's research is groundbreaking, in that he's discovered that &quot;every Bach Flower remedy is related to an area on the surface of the body.  Negative moods lead to a change in the energetic structure of these places, which often is accompanied by pain and disturbing sensations in the physical body.&quot;  His body maps clearly show the recommended Flower remedy for each part of the body.  In short, once healers have determined where the body is ailing, they can consult the body maps and know promptly which Flower remedy will be most effective.<br /> Kramer's research also shows that &quot;it is possible to increase the effect of the flowers tremendously through application of Bach Flowers to the disturbed areas.&quot;  He includes numerous case studies documenting his approach to treatment.<br /> New Bach Flower Body Maps is an essential reference for anyone experienced with using Bach Flower remedies.areas.&quot;  He includes numerous case studies documenting his approach to treatment.<br /> New Bach Flower Body Maps is an essential reference for anyone experienced with using Bach Flower remedies.	2002-08-06

In the Editor's Introduction, they explain that they published a book written nearly twenty years ago because the need to look at the paranormal in a way \\"that accomodates prior beliefs, doubts, and natural skepticism\\" still exists and that \\"William Justice provides this masterfully, in a manner both cordial and fair, clear and incisive.\\"<br /> Justice himself was not a psychic and had only three brief experiences that could be described as paranormal.  He did, however, have an open mind, and he had the ability to convince others to discuss their experiences.  He met and talked with Edgar Cayce, and other noteworthy spiritualists of his day.  He was also a researcher who studied the writings of men like Socrates, Abraham Lincoln, and Charles Lindbergh.  He says that \\"instances of spirit guides such as those who directed Lindbergh and Socrates are more numerous than many might imagine.  In fact, many of the world's great owe their places in history to the influence of spirit agency.\\"<br /> He also investigated the ouija board, astral projection and the nature of life after death.<br /> After a challenge by a friend, Justice began studying the Bible, looking for instances of paranormal experiences within it.

Millions of copies of the trilogy have been sold, and many readers have written to  Walsch with questions about his \\"uncommon dialogue.\\"<br /> In Questions and Answers on Conversations with God, Walsch has compiled a selection of readers' letters, along with his answers.  In his introduction, Walsch says \\"when you read these letters, don't be surprised if you find a bit of yourself here.  All of us, after all, are asking the same questions.  All of us are looking, in our own way from our own perspective, at the same issues.\\"<br /> He has divided the letters into 16 chapters, based on the kind of question asked.  People want to know about how to \\"be\\" rather than \\"do,\\" how to pray or meditate, whether angels exist, why evil exists, and why some of us are afflicted with physical or mental health problems.  They also are interested in discussing various points made in the original trilogy and its overall affect on their lives.<br /> Walsch emphasizes in all his responses that he is the one offering the answers in the book--that unlike the trilogy, it is not God who is providing the answers.  He says that those who want answers from God need only to do what he did originally--simply ask God.  As he explains, \\"all of the answers, God said, are inside of me.  All I have to do is go within.  That's all any of us have to do.  Go within, and meet the Creator.  For within us is where God resides.\\"<br /><br /> Nevertheless, he does attempt to answer the questions and challenges posed, and does so with love sprinkled with humor.  He expands upon some of the information presented in the trilogy and offers additional insights.  Walsch doesn't give people specific advice, but rather urges them to look within and do what it is that is best for them to do in any given circumstance.  Time and time again, he reminds readers that God is compassionate and loving and does not make judgments or punish us.<br /> Questions and Answers is an excellent companion to the Conversations With God trilogy.

Brennan has written more than 50 books and has lectured internationally.  His latest book, Magick for Beginners: The Power to Change Your World, is an easy to understand introduction to using magic.  It isn't about pulling rabbits out of hats or other sleight-of-hand tricks.  Brennan defines magic as \\"a collection of techniques, dating back at least 70,000 years, aimed at manipulating the human imagination in order to produce physical, psychological, or spiritual results.\\"<br /> He emphasizes that there's more than one system of magic.  Because his training was Qabalistically based, the techniques he describes include many elements from the Quabalah.<br /> Auto-suggestion and imagination play a huge role in the success of magic.  Human imagination is also described as \\"astral\\" and the astral world is as real as the physical world.  Practicing magic brings one into contact with the astral plane, and sometimes with astral entities.  For this reason, Brennan starts with basic safeguards that all magicians need to learn before doing anything else.<br /><br /> He then describes in great detail how and why magic works.  He begins with \\"low magic,\\" which includes instructions on how to produce a [$$$] bill.  Low magic also includes divination, auras, chakras, and dowsing.  Many of the low magic techniques are relatively easy to master and there are thousands of magicians practicing them.<br /> Brennan then discusses \\"high magic.\\"  High magic requires far more work and dedication, but the rewards are enormous.  It enables practitioners to \\"link [themselves] to the power and knowledge of the Universal Forces that underlie all reality.\\"  He includes instructions for rituals, pathworking, and conjuration.  Brennan finishes the high magic section with instructions for making oneself \\"invisible.\\"<br /> Interwoven throughout the book are threads from the Qabalah, and quantum physics.  Brennan draws parallels between the ancient and modern, and believes that science and magic will one day be recognized as one and the same.<br /> He's used an informal approach in Magick for Beginners to help remove the dark mystery surrounding the practice of magic and show that \\"magic can be fun.\\"  Readers following his instructions can evoke magic to safely improve their lives.

It's the story of how Jonah Quiller Mahoney and Zion Rose discovered themselves and each other.<br /><br /> Zion arrived on Earth from Zalos, via Geshlama, through a miscalculation made when she was eleven years old.  She was found wandering in the desert and eventually adopted by a woman named Jo.  She grew into a very beautiful, if eccentric, woman who never quite fits in.<br /> Jonah, who changed his name from John, fled Dallas and his Porsche, keeping only his infant daughter, Coral Kay.  He settled in the Four Corners area of the southwest, where he runs a local watering hole named the Coffee Talk, and lives in the home left in his care by Jo.  One night Jonah prays for a wife.<br />  He isn't particularly specific in his requirements--he'd like companionship, and he also needs someone to help mother his very precocious five-year-old daughter.  Zion arrives the next morning.<br /> Jonah also begins receiving extraterrestrial visitors, among them a huge purple owl that leaves a tattoo of a rose on his arm.  Zion experiences moments of extreme clarity, in which she understands all there is to understand, but forgets it by morning.  Jonah can handle this--but does have a problem when Zion doesn't remember having made love to him.<br /> In desperation, Jonah goes alone to Star Rock, a secret place.

He also founded &quot;Dahn Hak Movement,&quot; which is designed to help in spiritual awakening, and helped establish the New Millennium Peace Foundation with Neale Donald Walsch.  The United Nations has recognized Dr. Lee as a preeminent spiritual leader of the world.<br /> He emphasizes throughout the book that enlightenment is not just for a select few, but available to everyone.  He defines enlightenment as &quot;a simple choice that you make to live your life for the betterment and benefit of all those around you.&quot;  One needs only to make that choice, and then develop the discipline to live out that choice.<br /> Part of becoming enlightened involves training your life energy, or Ki.  Dr. Lee explains exactly how to do this.  He has also developed a technique called &quot;Brain Respiration&quot; as a &quot;realistic and everyday form of spiritual training&quot; for all those people who don't have the time or inclination to go live on a mountain top or join a  monastery.<br /> Once people achieve personal enlightenment, the next step is global enlightenment.  Dr. Lee says that we once all lived together as enlightened beings in harmony, and that we have deep spiritual longings to regain this world.  In order to do that, &quot;we need to recover the sense of Oneness and harmony that we have lost.&quot;  That requires making both a personal and a collective choice to be enlightened.  He wants at least one hundred million people to be spiritually enlightened by the end of this decade.  &quot;The healing vibration of their choices and determination will cure the Earth of the ills we have caused,&quot; he says.<br /><br /> Most people have forgotten that we are all part of One.

Legacy of Courage is the story of Elaine's life and her brutal death, as seen through Mints's eyes.  It's also the story of how one daughter discovered her mother and the love they had for each other.<br /> Mints's childhood was tumultuous and unhappy.  She treasures a few early memories of her happpy and pretty mother teaching her to curl her hair, comforting her, or listening to her stories.  But Mints also remembers seeing her mother hitting her head against the wall to quiet the voices tormenting her, and she remembers the subdued, but not healed, woman who returned from a series of electric shock treatments.<br /> What Mints remembers most is the day her mother disappeared, and the phone call she got three years later asking her to come to the morgue and identify Elaine's body.  She began a search then for the man who had raped and murdered a homeless insane woman.  Working by herself, she found enough evidence for the police to make an arrest.  She then endured an eight-year wait for that man to be brought to trial, \\"determined to prove that the murderer's victim was more than just another crazy homeless person, but someone once loved and treasured who deserves vindication.\\"<br /> One of the most moving and powerful books I've read in a long time, Legacy of Courage not only details a fight for justice and the effects of the fight on the victim's family, it's also \\"ultimately the chronicle of one woman's cathartic journey to the roots of forgiveness and the flowering of peace.\\"  Devoid of pretensions and permeated with truth, it's a book that can't be put down once started.	2002-07-14

Russek, Ph.D. say they know \\"scientifically that everything is eternal, alive, and evolving.\\"  Their book, The Living Energy Universe, details their theory about \\"universal living memory\\" and how they developed it.<br /> Schwartz is a professor of psychology, medicine, neurology, and psychiatry; and has taught at both Harvard and Yale, as well as held various directorships.  Russek is a professor of medicine and directs several health-related organizations.  Both are trained scientists dedicated to the search for truth.<br /> They first became interested in the question of whether life exists after physical death after Russek's father died.  They investigated phenomena as diverse as homeopathy and organ transplants, and concluded that everything in the universe has a memory.  Everything that is living retains a memory of all that's gone before it.<br /><br /> Schwartz and Russek  cite several cases of organ transplant recipients who have memories that belong to the organ donor.  The organ cells have retained the memories of the body they originated in.  The doctors also discuss homeopathy, where a remedy can be very powerful although the solution is so diluted that it may not contain even one molecule of the healing substance added to the water.  The water has retained the memory of the substance.<br /> They speculate that not only are beings living on Earth continually evolving, perhaps there is a cosmic consciousness that is also evolving, noting that evolution cannot take place without memory, and offering evidence that memory survives death.<br />  The doctors finish with a chapter listing ways in which their theory could be wrong, and their responses to those arguments.<br /> The Living Energy Universe elegantly explains Schwartz and Russek's hypothesis \\"that the whole universe is a living, remembering, self-revising process . . . and, therefore, in a deep sense, all things--great and small, visible and invisible, material and spiritual, past and future--are in an energetic state of 'becoming'.\\"  Readers will find themselves fascinated and comforted as the doctors explain how this means there is no true death.erial and spiritual, past and future--are in an energetic state of 'becoming'.\\"  Readers will find themselves fascinated and comforted as the doctors explain how this means there is no true death.	2002-07-14

There were no seasons, and everyone lived in one place, where the weather was perfect for most, although too hot for some, and too cold for others.  A world without death, and without changes or places to grow in a friendly environment, soon ceases to be paradise and quickly becomes overcrowded and unfriendly.<br /> And that's just what happened in the kingdom in which a small boy named Emir lived.  Emir's Education in the Proper Use of Magical Powers, by Jane Roberts, is a charming story for all ages.  The king, Emir's father, sent him on a trip to learn the names of all that he saw:  plants, animals, lands, and seas.  Being a child, and being used to getting his own way by simply stamping his feet and demanding what he wanted, Emir had much more than names to learn.<br /> Emir journeys to the Land of the Gods first, then searches for the God of All Life.  His personality keeps him from getting the answers he seeks.  Unable to admit this, he tells a lie to his people, which makes him even more miserable.  Luckily, he has a week in which to come up with the true answer.  He sheds his pride and arrogance and seeks help from Conscience and Inspiration, from whom he learns that \\"all living things must have their own seasons of birth, growth, and returning to the earth.\\"<br /> Roberts is the author of the \\"Seth\\" books, spiritual classics published in the 1970s.  Emir's Education in the Proper Use of Magical Powers, lovingly illustrated with pen-and-ink drawings, is a fairy tale for young and old alike, meant to remind us \\"to honor the cycles of life, the seasons, and world diversity.\\"	2002-06-27

She has worked in a variety of fields, and includes another book and an highly-acclaimed multimedia program among her credits.  She describes herself as &quot;a long-time student of the way in which thought and feelings format our lives.&quot;<br /> The essence of her philosophy is the Law of Attraction: that is, like attracts like.  If we want good things and success in our lives, then that's what we need to be thinking about.  Most people make the mistake of thinking about the things they don't want to happen, and unwittingly draw those very things to them.<br /> It is necessary, however, to do more than just think about what we want in a detached way--it's our feelings that determine what enters our lives.  Grabhorn says &quot;that's right, we get what we want by the way we feel, not by trying to slug things into place or control our minds.  And since most of us haven't felt too hot about what we've had for most of our lives, we've become highly gifted masters at attracting an overabundance of circumstances we'd rather not have.&quot;<br /> Grabhorn explains that first it's necessary to identify what it is that you don't want.  From that, you can identify what you do want.  She gives lots of tips for describing your wants in positive ways.  Then you need to &quot;get into the feeling place of what you want.&quot;  This is extremely important, and she provides detailed suggestions and examples.  Finally, you simply expect success and allow it to happen.<br /> She emphasizes that you don't need to struggle against the things you don't want in your life--all you have to do is to quit thinking about them.  Easier said than done, of course, but Grabhorn offers lots of helpful suggestions.<br /> &quot;If you really think that things come to you by some stroke of good or bad luck, or by accident, or coincidence, or by knocking your brains out against some very unsympathetic stone walls, then get a grip,&quot; Grabhorn says, adding that her book &quot;could be dangerous to your discontent.&quot;<br /> Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting teaches readers a simple and effective technique for transforming their lives and obtaining whatever it is that they desire.

Her book is a visual, as well as culinary, pleasure.<br /> McIntyre starts with an explanation of why water is so important-our bodies are seventy-five percent water.  We lose 3 quarts of water every day through normal functions like breathing, perspiring, and urinating.  All that liquid must be replaced, and she offers healthy and delicious alternatives to simply drinking lots of plain water.<br /> The next section includes a discussion of the primary ingredients used in the recipes.  She describes each one completely, including a brief history of its use, the nutrients it contains, and all the good things it can do for the body.  Spices, grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables all have a page in this section.<br /> Recipes, classified by benefit offered, fill the rest of the book.  McIntyre includes drinks for looking and feeling good, drinks for recovering from illness, and drinks for healing the soul and spirit.<br /> Losing weight, clear eyes, great skin and hair, raising energy, stimulating the immune system, and boosting the brain are part of feeling good.  Illnesses include clearing coughs and other cold symptoms, flu-busters, headaches, fevers, insomnia, arthritis, PMS, and many others.  Drinks for relieving anxiety and stress, renewal, and helping depression round out the healing recipes.<br /> I can personally vouch for the effectiveness of Nero's Nectar, a very simple recipe for relieving chest congestion due to a cold!<br /> McIntyre ends with an appendix offering tips on things like selecting blenders and juicers, and choosing ingredients.

He's also received several awards and honors from various medical groups.<br /> In his latest book, Elements of Danger:  Protect Yourself Against the Hazards of Modern Dentistry, Dr. Walker takes on the dental profession.  He focuses on the practice of using metal fillings, but also discusses other procedures, like root canals.<br /> He says he found a \\"paradox, for the nature of dental care among industrialized nations has our dental health providers reacting to disease rather than keeping people's mouths functioning healthfully and well.\\"  He maintains that most dentists don't look at the patient as a complete individual  or dental health as a part of overall good health.<br /> Dr. Walker offers a thorough discussion of the potential problems of using metal fillings, especially those containing mercury.  He includes a questionnaire that will help readers determine if their fillings are adversely affecting their health.  He lists thirty symptoms of metal toxicity, including memory problems, depression, insomnia, heartburn, headaches, and fatigue.<br /> Root canals can also lead to myriad health problems, particularly infection which can affect other parts of the body, and deterioration of the jawbone.  He also includes a section on the dangers of fluoridation, reminding readers that fluoride is \\"an industrial waste product commonly sold as poison for killing rats and insects.\\"  He notes that the Food and Drug Administration now requires a warning label on all fluoridated toothpastes, advising consumers to contact a Poison Control Center if the toothpaste is accidently swallowed.<br /> The final section of the book describes natural ways of achieving and maintaining good dental health, including guidelines for choosing a dentist that uses safe and non-toxic procedures.

He first explains what imagination is, then teaches readers how to use it for creative visualization that will help them change their lives.<br /> Shone says that while visual images are the most common, people can experience imagery through sound, touch, smell, taste, and movement.  His first exercise has the reader forming images based on all the senses.  Thereafter, he concentrates on visual imagery, but his techniques are applicable to all types of imagery.<br /> &quot;The basic message,&quot; says Shone, &quot;is that the brain, when it creates an image (whether the image is a memory or something unreal), gives rise to consistent body changes and to behavioral changes.&quot;  In other words, you can change yourself by visualizing yourself as different.  You can change the way you feel, mentally and physically, and you can change the way you act.  Shone maintains that imagination is stronger than will, making visualization more powerful than will power.<br /> Visualization can be used to improve all aspects of one's life.  Shone offers specific suggestions for use at work, sports and hobbies, shyness, memory, achieving goals, relieving pain and improving health, and increasing energy.  He  also discusses using dream imagery at the conscious level and the role of visualization in working with inner guides.<br /> Shone says that &quot;although the range of topics is quite wide, you will soon realize that they all basically follow the same format; it then becomes much easier to form images and utilize creative visualization in virtually any aspect of living.<br /> Readers who are interested in developing their<br />imaginations and using imagery for self-help  will find that Creative Visualization  provides the guidance and help they need to transform their lives.	2002-06-10

The author of three previous books, she wrote Compass of the Heart: Embodying Medicine Wheel Teachings for &quot;those who are presently living a life dedicated to sacred alignment and want to open to further possibilities.&quot;<br /> The medicine wheel is simply one way of orienting oneself spiritually.  It may be interpreted and used in more than one way.  The directions, East, South, West, and North, have many associations.  Cruden divides her book into parts, devoting several chapters to each of the directions.  For example, East is linked with air, and includes chapters on breath, prayer, and meditation, among others.  Other names for East include Spring, Morning, Mind, Child, Perception, Beginning, I Ching, and Awareness.<br /> In addition to the cardinal directions, there is also Earth, Sky, and Center.  She discusses the meanings and rituals associated with these as well.  The section on Earth includes complete instructions for building and using a sweat lodge, and the Sky discussion explains vision quest ceremonies.  Center represents God, or what Cruden calls Mystery.<br /><br /> Each chapter includes her observations about all the spiritual aspects of that direction, as well as suggestions for rituals and exercises.  She also includes information on using medicine wheels in conjunction with chakras and totems.  Some exercises aid in understanding and working with your beliefs about yourself and your role in the world.<br /> Cruden says &quot;daily spiritual practices are steps that help guide choice and action by facilitating alignment with Spirit,&quot; adding that &quot;any daily actions thoughtfully made can be considered spiritual practice.&quot;  Compass of the Heart uses medicine wheel practices to teach readers how to achieve &quot;spiritual awareness [that] is not an intermittent inspiration but is life itself.&quot;nspiration but is life itself.&quot;	2002-06-10

Blawyn and Jones present several traditions, including T'ai Chi, Chi Kung, Sufi Earth Dancing, Veil Dancing, Whirling, and the Dance of the Four Directions.<br /> They emphasize that no one method is better than the others.  Readers are encouraged to try them all before deciding on what works best for them.  The authors also recognize that &quot;we need to achieve definite results quickly, because most of us can only set aside a few minutes each day for whatever technique we have chosen.&quot;<br /> Blawyn and Jones include several breathing and meditation exercises, and also discuss the role of colors, scents, crystals, and music in energizing the body.<br /><br /> They then explain all the physical exercises in detail, with each technique illustrated with line drawings.<br /><br /> The final chapter explains how physical movement helps to rejuvenate and heal the body.

Any blocks or imbalances in the chakras can result in disease or emotional difficulties.<br /> After discussing chakras in general, Pond devotes a chapter to each of the seven primary energy centers.  He first describes the &quot;drive&quot; or purpose of each chakra.  For example, the first chakra is concerned with survival, while the fourth chakra deals with the quest for love.  He then discusses all the ways in which the chakra can be out of balance, including problems related to too much energy as well as difficulties stemming from too little energy.  After explaining how to balance the chakra, Pond discusses how to keep it in balance.<br /> Each chapter includes exercises designed to balance and maintain the individual chakras.

Alternative medicine offers proven \\"solutions for identifying and treating the underlying causes and can bring lasting relief to arthritis sufferers.\\"  That's the message offered by Eugene R. Zampieron, N.D., A.H.G., and Ellen Kamhi, Ph.D., R.N., H.N.C. in their new book, Arthritis:  An Alternative Medicine Definitive Guide.<br /> Dr. Zampieron specializes in non-toxic treatment of arthritis and other rheumatological and autoimmune disorders.  Dr. Kamhi is known as an authority on natural healing.  Both doctors appear on radio and television shows, teach, and lead workshops.<br /> Although more than 100 types of arthritis are known, the doctors focus on the three most common kinds:  osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  They also discuss gout, psoriatic arthritis, and infectious arthritis.  More than 20 million Americans suffer from one or more of these diseases.<br /> Conventional medicine offers numerous drugs to relieve arthritis.  Generally those drugs simply relieve pain, without providing permanent help.  Many of the drugs cause unpleasant side effects as well.  Zampieron and Kamhi say that \\"Alternative medicine, on the other hand, offers a wide range of treatment options for eliminating the often hidden causes of arthritis.\\"  They add that \\"the primary keys are proper diet and nutrition, detoxification, and stress reduction.\\"<br /> The two doctors explain how to accomplish each of these in detail, including case histories of patients they have helped.  They provide information on their \\"arthritis diet,\\" complete with sample recipes.  They also describe all the testing procedures for finding the causes of arthritis, and how to remove those causes.  Detoxification plays a big role, and they explain how to do that.  Stress reduction is covered in the mind-body section.  They also include information on supplements, exercises, and physical therapy.<br /> \\"Quick Definitions\\" are scattered throughout the book, so that readers can learn the meaning of any unknown words.  Complete information is also given on contacting labs, healers, and providers of recommended services/supplies in the text.<br /> While the emphasis is on reversing or alleviating arthritis after it's developed, the solutions suggested by Zampieron and Kamhi are equally effective in preventing the onset of arthritis.  Arthritis provides essential information for every American who wishes to live a life free from the suffering of this preventable and correctable disease..<BR> \\"Quick Definitions\\" are scattered throughout the book, so that readers can learn the meaning of any unknown words.

A hypnotherapist, he has authored numerous books, appeared on television programs, and been the subject of newscasts, radio broadcasts, and magazine articles.  He has conducted more than 33,000 past life regressions and future life progressions.<br /> Dr. Goldberg maintains \\"it is certain that we have a second body that can safely leave and return to our physical body.\\"  In Astral Voyages: Mastering the Art of Soul Travel, he explains how everyone can learn to leave their body behind and travel wherever they want to go.  He emphasizes that the purpose of astral travel is to encourage the spiritual growth of the soul.<br /> He explains how travelers can protect themselves with white light, and maintains that there is no danger in leaving the body.  He also says that everyone has the ability to leave their bodies, that, in fact, we all do so when we dream at night.  His intention is to help people develop their abilities so that they may travel at will.<br /> Some techniques for astral travel work well for some people, while other people need different methods.  Dr. Goldberg presents detailed instructions for a variety of ways on achieving out-of-body experiences, including using crystals, herbs, or oils, visualization, contemplation, and hypnosis.  Readers are encouraged to experiment with them all, and then choose the technique that works best for them.<br /> One chapter describes the types of beings astral travelers might meet in their voyages.  While most people meet only loving masters and guides, Dr. Goldberg does provide instructions on how to recognize and protect oneself from a negative entity.<br /> One section even explains how to have astral sex! (No, it isn't done quite the same way on astral planes as it's done on the physical plane.)<br /> Dr. Goldberg says that \\"more people than ever possess the ability to soul travel and explore alternate and probable futures, move into new understandings and concepts of time, control the subconscious, and tap into the powers of their Higher Self.\\"  Astral Travel provides all the techniques and guidelines needed to achieve your own out-of-body experience.nd concepts of time, control the subconscious, and tap into the powers of their Higher Self.\\"  Astral Travel provides all the techniques and guidelines needed to achieve your own out-of-body experience.	2002-05-19

As Harish Johari says, \\"food is something very personal and it should never be eaten for taste alone; its purpose is to provide nutrients and satisfaction to the body, without introducing toxins.\\"  Johari, a Tantric and Ayurvedic scholar, wrote twelve books, as well as produced audiocassettes and CDs, before his death in 1999.  Ayurvedic Healing Cuisine: 200 Vegetarian Recipes for Health, Balance, and Longevity, published posthumously, \\"explains the healing qualities of various foods and spices and recommends combinations appropriate for specific conditions of body and mind.\\"<br /> Johari first introduces the principles of Ayurveda, fully discussing the role of the five elements and describing the doshas--a way of classifying body types and temperments.  He also explains that there are six tastes--sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent.  Each of the tastes has a different effect on the body.  Foods are further classified as to whether they are hot or cold and heavy or light.  These attributes also affect the body in various ways.<br /> Understanding how foods interact with one another and how they effect the body provides a foundation for healthy eating.  Johari maintains that \\"most diseases are the result of wrong eating habits and/or of eating antagonist foods.\\"<br /> He also includes information on the nutrients in food, such as protein and vitamins.  That's followed by a section describing the healing properties of specific foods.  He suggests using milk as a source of protein, rather than meat or eggs.<br /> The bulk of the book is devoted to recipes, including how to prepare various Indian spice mixtures.  All of the recipes are Westernized versions of Indian foods and use ingredients that can be obtained in the West.  Many are prepared using a wok.  Johari presents recipes for snacks, dals, main dishes, salads, condiments, breads, desserts, and beverages.<br /> Appendices include menu suggestions, and several special recipes for children and the elderly.  He finishes with a list of spice and specialty food suppliers.<br /> Readers interested in applying the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda healing to contemporary lifestyles will find both an excellent reference and delicious recipes in Ayurvedic Healing Cuisine.s.  <BR> Appendices include menu suggestions, and several special recipes for children and the elderly.

He described it as \\"a collection of the memorable events in my life,\\" which he gathered at the recommendation of don Juan Matus, the Yaqui Indian shaman who was his teacher.  An anthropologist and shaman, Castaneda wrote ten other books, including The Teachings of Don Juan.<br /> Collecting the memorable events in one's life is a way of stirring \\"caches of energy that exist within the self,\\" and making that energy available.<br /> The process requires \\"the genuine and all-consuming act of putting together the sum total of one's emotions and realizations, without sparing anything.\\"  It's not a process that one undertakes lightly.  Castaneda says that, for a shaman, the act of collecting memorable events is preparation for a \\"definitive journey\\" into the \\"active side of infinity.\\"<br /> Non-shamans call the definitive journey \\"death,\\" and the active side of infinity \\"the afterlife.\\"  Shamans believe that human energy exists in a very real place after death, and they prepare themselves for continued existence in that place.<br /> The collection of memorable events is not a personal memoir, or a rehashing of life's experiences, but instead is stories and events that touch something universal in all humans.  They often change the life path of those to whom they occurred.<br /> Castaneda describes how he first met don Juan, and his difficulties in finding him after they lost contact just after their meeting.  He also includes several stories from his life as a child and a young man--events he had totally forgotten, but that had irrevocably changed his life.<br /> Whether or not one agrees with Castaneda and don Juan about the afterlife, those who read The Active Side of Infinity will find themselves thinking about their lives, and journeys they must take after death, in a different way.	2002-05-19

Gerber is a practicing doctor who sought less invasive means than drugs and surgery for helping his patients, especially those with chronic illnesses.  His book is the result of more than twenty years of research into alternative medical treatments.<br /> Dr. Gerber describes his book as \\"an introduction to a new system of thinking about health and illness in general.\\"  He believes people are complex energy systems.  Vibrational medicine includes all forms of medical treatment, such as homeopathy, that can affect human energy fields.<br /> His book does not list various diseases or suggest remedies to heal those diseases.  Instead, he discusses how energy functions, and how the vibrational remedies work to restore imbalances in human energy systems.  He includes study after study showing the healing affects of homeopathy, flower essences, gem elixirs, and therapeutic touch.<br /> The vibrational remedies don't contain a substance that promotes healing--they contain the \\"signature\\" or vibration of a particular substance.  That vibration resonates with the vibration of human cells to stimulate healing.  Dr. Gerber points out that \\"while the chemical agents of modern medicine may treat the symptoms of disease, vibrational remedies create energy changes at multiple levels in order to produce a more lasting healing.\\"<br /> Many people have tried vibrational remedies and know they work.  Dr. Gerber provides the scientific data needed to validate that knowledge.  Readers new to vibrational medicine will find his book a treasure trove of information; and those who have experienced it first hand will appreciate the thoroughness of his research and documentation.  Vibrational Medicine belongs in the library of everyone interested in gentle, natural  healing.	2002-04-15

Vollbracht says that Confucius was &quot;one of the most remarkable individuals to walk this earth.&quot;  Reducing the  philosophy of Confucius to clever fortune-cookie type of sayings is a serious loss of wisdom.<br /> Vollbracht, a leadership and personal development trainer, says that the teachings of Confucius, &quot;when examined seriously, are recognized as profound expressions of the human spirit.  The universality of his message, when understood in the context of his lessons, can yield infinite satisfaction, both personal and national, to those who endeavor to follow his path.&quot;<br /> Confucius lived and taught in China more than 2500 years ago, during a time of repressive political regimes, heavy taxation, and near-rebellion from the masses.  He believed that virtue was &quot;the most powerful force in the universe.&quot;  If people acquired virtue, then they could reform their families, their communities, their nation, and eventually the world.  Confucius taught &quot;that whoever wished to change society should look within, to the personal acquisition of virtue.&quot;<br /> Vollbracht starts each lesson with brief background information, which leads to a question from a student.  Confucius then answers the question.  Often his answers lead to further questions from the student.<br /> Lessons include discourses on the power of the individual to change the world, how to live a virtuous daily life and follow the path of virtue, the power of music, and self-discovery.<br /> Each lesson is accompanied with drawings taken from ancient art depicting the life of Confucius.<br /> Vollbracht ends with the observation that the teachings of Confucius &quot;affirm that all men and women are created equal and that by cultivating virtue within the soul, each and every person can make a profound contribution to the world.&quot;  The Way of Virtue is an excellent resource for all those interested in cultivating the virtue within them.of Virtue is an excellent resource for all those interested in cultivating the virtue within them.	2002-04-14

Writing has changed my life.  Writing has saved my life.&quot;  In her newest book, Writing as a Way of Healing:  How Telling Our Stories Transforms Our Lives, DeSalvo provides readers with detailed instructions on how they, too, can heal themselves.<br /> Unlike most authors, DeSalvo doesn't advise writers to free-associate, or write whatever comes to mind in whatever order it comes, as a way of healing.  She recommends, instead, choosing a traumatic event and fully exploring it.  She says &quot;to improve health, we must write detailed accounts, linking feelings with events.&quot;<br /> She cites numerous studies showing that people who wrote about traumatic events, and included the details of their emotions, initially had negative feelings to overcome, but then experienced many long-term positive benefits.  Those benefits were both mental and physical, including improvements to the immune system.  She says &quot;when we deal with unassimilated events, when we tell our stories and describe our feelings and integrate them into our sense of self, we no longer must actively work at inhibition.  This alleviates the stress of holding back our stories and repressing or hiding our emotions, and so our health improves.&quot;<br /> A researcher into the therapeutic benefits of writing for more than twenty years, DeSalvo has filled her book with examples,  including the effect of her mother's severe depression on her life, excerpts from diaries and journals of people like Virginia Woolf and Isabel Allende, and numerous essays from her writing students.<br /> &quot;This book is an invitation to engage with your writing process over time in a way that allows you to discover strength, power, wisdom, depth, energy, creativity, soulfulness, and wholesomeness. . .&quot; DeSalvo says.  She recognizes that people are busy and asks only that they commit fifteen minutes a day, four days a week, to writing the story of their lives.  We can use the &quot;tiny pockets of time throughout our day,&quot; like time spent waiting in traffic jams or at supermarket checkouts, if that's all that we have.<br /> Writing as a Way of Healing is meant for anyone who has survived childhood.  You don't have to be an experienced writer to benefit from DeSalvo's advice and techniques--the only requirement is a desire to heal your emotional wounds and find the joy in life that is rightfully yours.eir lives.

When Peterson spontaneously regressed to a past life while hypnotized, Winston then utilized a special hypnotic technique called \\"third witness,\\" which he developed, to take Peterson through several past lives and a future life.  All the sessions between the two were recorded.<br /> Peterson disappeared after the sessions, and several years later, Winston was killed in an automobile accident.  Winston's daughter sent the tapes of the Peterson sessions to Joseph Robert Cowles.  Cowles transcribed the tapes and has now published them in a fascinating book titled Third Witness.<br /> Peterson describes several past lives, beginning with one in which he picked dates in a very dusty environment.  Between lives he rested in a void where there was \\"no time\\" and \\"no space,\\" where there was only \\"I am.\\"  He refused to use the word death or refer to himself as dying, saying instead that \\" Somehow life is a thing that just is, so even when you're dead, you're actually life.\\"  There is no death, only \\"molecular . . . recombinations.\\"<br /> He also says that what we term the past, present, and future exist simultaneously.<br /><br /> In the last session, Peterson moved forward several centuries in the future, where he worked as a specialized miner on a \\"geosynchronous satellite,\\" one of many such satellites inhabited by former residents of Earth.<br /> Third Witness take readers on an engrossing journey into the past, and provides a tantalizing peek into the future, in the process answering the question of what's life like after death.	2002-04-14

He is also a founding director of the Traditional Chinese Medicine World Foundation, Inc., and is involved in SHARE, a self-help organization for women with breast and ovarian cancer.  He is also a Qigong master and martial arts champion.<br /> In Traditional Chinese Medicine: A Woman's Guide to Healing from Breast Cancer, Dr. Lu describes how ancient TCM techniques can help prevent, treat, and aid recovery from breast cancer.  He emphasizes throughout the book that \\"TCM is dedicated to helping the individual treat the source and not the symptoms of his or her problem.\\"<br /> Dr. Lu presents lots of general information about TCM, natural laws, and Qi, repeating that \\"everything has a connection and everything has an effect on every other thing.\\"  He then applies those principles specifically to breast cancer.  He says that \\"headaches, stomachaches, PMS, or menstrual irregularities. . .are not normal conditions for a healthy body.\\"  He regards them as symptoms that should be heeded, to prevent future difficulties.<br /> TCM can be used in many simple ways.  For example, doing a monthly breast exam is a source of stress for many women, because it focuses their thoughts on having breast cancer.  Dr. Lu recommends \\"telling yourself instead, that wherever you touch, you are sending in healing energy to protect that location so that you will never have breast cancer.\\"  He includes many other ways to conserve, increase, and use the natural healing energy each human possesses.<br /> The healing information is presented in a way that allows each woman to customize  the techniques to fit her own needs.  All the techniques are compatible with modern medicine and may be used in conjunction with other treatments.<br /> Dr. Lu says that  \\"many of the self-healing techniques I've talked about can help keep your organs working in harmony.\\"  Bodies that are in harmony and balanced do not suffer from physical problems, including cancer.<br /> The Woman's Guide to Healing from Breast Cancer is a valuable reference for everyone, regardless of age, sex, or current physical condition.armony and balanced do not suffer from physical problems, including cancer.  <BR> The Woman's Guide to Healing from Breast Cancer is a valuable reference for everyone, regardless of age, sex, or current physical condition.	2002-04-14

She has developed a technique called &quot;Spontaneous Contemplative Movement&quot; (SCM), which allows women to hear the messages their bodies have for them.  SCM, done in a controlled environment, involves letting what is deep in the mind tell the body how to move, and then interpreting those movements.<br /> She says that intuition is based in our bodies and adds that &quot;body wisdom contains the essential truths about what matters most to a woman and ultimately to the human race as a whole. &quot;  Our bodies are constantly sending us signals, but we've forgotten how to read them.<br /> Dr. Reeves describes how our bodies speak to us, what those messages mean in general, and how to interpret what they mean to us as individuals.

The Robertson's emphasis is on turning the kitchen into an oasis of peace and tranquility, where meal preparation is a relaxing and rejuvenating experience.  They say that &quot;in sacred texts from all over the world, we learned about the secret energies of food and the hidden meaning behind the act of cooking itself.&quot;<br /> All cooks transfer some of their energy to the food they prepare.  A meal cooked with love in a stress-free kitchen has significant healing effects on those eating it.  The Robertsons emphasize the importance of &quot;mindfulness&quot; in food preparation.

The title of his book, Stand Like Mountain, Flow Like Water: Reflections on Stress and Human Spirituality, is based on a t'ai chi saying.  Seaward says &quot;to stand like a mountain suggests a sense of stability, resistant to the winds of change.  To move like water implies the ability to go with the flow, rather than trying to change things we have no control over.&quot;<br /> He says that balance can be learned, but doing so requires becoming aware of, and using, our inner resources.  Inner resources include humor, creativity, courage, intuition, and faith, among others.  Inner resources &quot;can and should be employed every day,&quot; not just during times of crisis.<br /> Study after study has documented the harmful effects of stress on the human body.  Seward says many people feel stress because they have betrayed their spiritual nature by not living the lives they know they should be living.  He compares life to climbing up a mountain, with each of us picking out the one path that is best for us.  He says &quot;not only are there numerous paths, but we each move at a pace conducive to our soul's  growth process.&quot;  He adds that &quot;it is impossible to get lost on the spiritual path.  We can only be immobilized by our own fears.&quot;  Confronting stressors overcomes those fears and brings balance to our lives.<br /> Seward drew from many disciplines, including psychology, theology, quantum physics, philosophy, sociology, and mythology, as well as from his experience as a therapist, to write Stand Like Mountain, Flow Like Water.  He says that &quot;it is my sole wish that the collective wisdom found among these pages serve as a reminder of what we already know, because the guidance we seek is really within us.&quot;	2002-03-29

Cudda keeps up a refrain of &quot;what if,&quot; keeping us in a constant state of worry.  Wudda prefers to suffer and eschews responsibility, maintaining that everything is always the fault of someone or something else.  The three of them conspire to &quot;inflict self-doubt and indecision&quot; upon all that we do.<br /> Chevalier found help from another voice, that of Ima WiseOne.  She deflects the others, providing only love and encouragement.  With her help, the doubts can be changed to &quot;New Thoughts,&quot; which are affirming and empowering.<br /> For example, when Chevalier worries about whether other people are being treated fairly and what she should do, Shudda says &quot;it is not your job to decide who is right and who is wrong.&quot;  Cudda says &quot;it is hopeless to try to change people.  Look at how many other people have tried and failed.  Some of them are dead.&quot;  Wudda says &quot;it is impossible to help others free themselves.  What makes you think you are able to do such a thing?&quot;  The WiseOne points out that &quot;standing up for unfair treatment often means some folks won't like you or what you say.&quot;  Chevalier's New Thought is: &quot;I choose right action based on principles important to me.&quot;<br /> Each day of the year has a similar worry, with the Shudda, Cudda, Wudda dialogue rebutted by the WiseOne to yield a New Thought.  Additionally, each month starts with an adage, such as &quot;Excuses are only useful to help explain why I didn't do what was important for me to do.  They never help me reach a goal.&quot;<br /> Chevalier, a therapist, specializes in recovery issues.  She has maintained a private practice for 20 years, as well as teaching at the university level in the States and abroad.  Shudda, Cudda, Wudda, her second book, will help readers overcome the self-doubts making them miserable and enable them to fill their lives instead with joy, peace, and purpose.elp me reach a goal.&quot;<BR> Chevalier, a therapist, specializes in recovery issues.

Clinical psychologist A. Thomas Horvath provides an alternative to 12-step in Sex, Drugs, Gambling, & Chocolate: A Workbook for Overcoming Addictions.  He says \\"the purpose of this workbook is to draw together ideas and techniques that have been well studied and used in the field of addiction psychology and to present them in one readable workbook.\\"<br /> Dr. Horvath begins with the concept that addiction is a habit, and like other habits, it can be changed.  While addiction usually has worse consequences than most habits, and changing it can be extremely difficult, it is still a habit, and it can be changed.  He defines addiction as \\"repeated involvement with anything, despite excessive costs, because of craving.\\"  He adds that \\"an addiction is a type of relationship between an individual and [a] substance or activity.\\"  The idea that the person is a victim of the substance or activity is erroneous.<br /> He divides his workbook into chapters on the perceived benefits of addiction, the costs of addiction, understanding and coping with craving, choices, and building a new life.  Each chapter has an overview, followed by a detailed discussion of the subject.  Then comes questions which help readers connect the information to their personal circumstances.  Each chapter also includes two or three simple projects designed to help individuals apply the previous information in their lives.  Chapters end with a section titled \\"What's Important Now?\\" which give readers an opportunity to record their personal growth.<br /> Horvath is at all times encouraging and supportive, realizing that change comes in small increments.  He also keeps his advice very practical and doesn't resort to jargon or \\"psychobabble.\\"  He maintains that we all have choices, and recognizes that people feel resentment when told that they have to overcome addictive behavior.  Horvath says \\"regardless of what anyone else thinks, its up to you what happens with your addiction.\\"<br /> Sex, Drugs, Gambling, & Chocolate is designed for those who are choosing to overcome any addictive behavior and need practical help with achieving their goal.  Horvath's workbook is based on taking personal responsiblity for your behavior and does not require total abstinance or turning your life over to a \\"Higher Power,\\" unless you choose to do so.to you what happens with your addiction.\\"<BR> Sex, Drugs, Gambling, & Chocolate is designed for those who are choosing to overcome any addictive behavior and need practical help with achieving their goal.

Together they've written an easy-to-understand book that will answer every question you might have about being psychic.<br /> Robinson emphasizes that everyone is psychic.  It simply takes a bit of practice to develop your abilities.  The book is filled with easy exercises designed to help bring you recognize psychic experiences and develop your own \\"sixth sense.\\"<br /> The authors present a brief history of psychic phenomena, beginning with the Babylonians, who \\"read\\" animal entrails to predict the future.  They also list people who have depended on their psychic abilities, including Sir Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, and Henry Ford.  They also tell you how to choose a psychic, or intuitive, consultant and what to reasonably expect from a reading.<br /> Most of the book, however, is devoted to developing your own abilities.  They emphasize that \\"your intuition is sending you information all the time--you just need to start noticing it.\\"  People receive information in various ways.  The most common are clairvoyance (inner vision), clairaudience (inner voice), and clairsentience (inner sensing).  Others can touch an object and know its history (psychometry), while some receive information via taste or smell.  They also discuss hypnosis, dreams, telepathy, auras, precognition, ESP, channeling, and astral travel.<br /> Once you learn to recognize and develop your particular psychic abilities, you can then use them to improve your life, especially for mental and physical healing.  Your intuition can help you decide what your ideal life is, and then help you live that ideal.  For those who wish to help others, the authors provide information on how to give a reading.<br /> Robinson and Carlson-Finnerty have also compiled several appendices of resource material, including Internet sources.<br /> The Complete Idiot's Guide to Being Psychic is a useful reference for anyone wishing to understand or develop their innate talents.

Dr. Moody is an internationally recognized expert on near death experiences.  He has written seven previous books, and presents lectures, as well as appearing on national television.<br /> Dr. Moody believes that meaningful discussion of paranormal phenomena has been obscured by three groups of people:  the parapsychologists, who rely on science to provide proof; the skeptics, who believe paranormal experiences are either delusions or fraud; and the fundamentalists, who hold that all things paranormal are the work of the devil.  Dr. Moody says that near-death experiences aren't death experiences, and therefore none of us know what really happens after death.<br /> He says that &quot;what I am suggesting throughout this whole book is that, if we are to discover any real truths about the paranormal, about near-death experiences, and about life after death, we will only do so if we stop taking everything so seriously.&quot;  He expands that by saying we take what knowledge we have literally, and that &quot;taking things literally [impedes] learning.&quot;  He says that rather than study paranormal experiences &quot;from a place of literalness,&quot; he begins &quot;from a place of childlike willingness to explore everything playfully, but with intention to look closely and with respect at what my explorations revealed.&quot;<br /> One of his discoveries is the &quot;empathic near death experience,&quot; where the experience is shared by the dying person with someone who is not dying.  Dr. Moody's research also reveals that the paranormal has entertainment value for humans.  He says that he has &quot;become increasingly aware of how entertainment, humor, play, and the paranormal are, in a curious way, intimately enmeshed.&quot;  We enjoy trying to solve the puzzle and paradoxes presented by paranormal phenomena.<br /> Dr. Moody says &quot;The Last Laugh seeks to pry open the dam holding back the stream of information about. . .near-death experiences.&quot;  Readers will find their beliefs about the paranormal, whatever those beliefs may be, challenged by his comments.

Bloomfield, M.D.<br /> A recognized expert, Dr. Bloomfield has written numerous other books about natural healing, many of them best-sellers.  He says &quot;each year sixty-five million Americans experience some symptoms of anxiety.&quot;  Anxiety not only causes symptoms such as headaches and fatigue, it also worsens other medical problems.<br /> Dr. Bloomfield first defines anxiety as an exaggerated stress response and explains how the body and mind become stressed.  He then discusses herbs in general, pointing out that &quot;80 percent of the people on earth rely on herbs for their health care needs.&quot;  The United States is one of the few countries where herbs are not routinely prescribed by mainstream health care practitioners.<br /> The main prescription drugs for anxiety, depression, and insomnia are described, along with their side effects.  Dr. Bloomfield states that most of these drugs are over prescribed &quot;because, until now, most doctors and patients were unaware of herbal alternatives.&quot;  He says that some anxiety problems may not need any treatment, other than an opportunity for the patient to practice self-healing, than adds &quot;when a medicinal agent is needed, however, herbal remedies deserve to be considered before synthetic drugs because of their relative safety and fewer side effects, as well as their effectiveness.&quot;<br /> Each of the anti-anxiety, sedative, and anti-depressant herbs are discussed in detail, including recommended dosages.  He provides the medicinal history of each herb, along with an explanation of how it works.  He also warns against combining or overusing certain herbs.<br /> The final section of the book is devoted to natural self-healing.  Dr. Bloomfield says that anxiety &quot;signals a need to change to a more healthful lifestyle.&quot;  He has developed a natural self-healing program based on his more than thirty years &quot;in the practice of integrative psychiatry, alternative medicine, and psychotherapy.&quot;  He describes several strategies designed to enable you to &quot;immediately feel more inner peace and personal power.&quot;<br /> Freeing yourself from guilt, achieving emotional freedom, and recovering from a broken heart are among the natural self-healing techniques.<br /> Dr. Bloomfield says &quot;long-term, expensive treatments are seldom necessary.

She adds that the writing will never happen if we wait for the fear to vanish--that we just have to take a deep breath and start writing.  She advises letting the writing lead you where it wants to go rather than trying to control it.<br /> The exercises are simple, with lots of suggestions to help get you started.  Newman provides examples with each one.  She suggests starting with twenty minutes of free writing (writing whatever is on your mind, without judging it) every day.  Other exercises involve describing common household objects or completing the sentence &quot;I remember. . ..&quot;  She then gets into describing imaginary places, people, and secrets.<br /> The exercises end with the technical basics, like plotting and point of view.  Newman tells writers to &quot;start at the top of the page and work their way to the bottom.  Just start writing.  Don't think.  Don't worry about the end product.&quot;  That same advice applies to the exercises in her book.  Start with the first one and continue with the next one, until they're all done.  The  results will surprise you!<br /> Writing From The Heart is for every woman, regardless of what she thinks of her writing ability.  As Newman says, &quot;writing should be fun.  There is a deep pleasure in exploring your own heart and mind, pushing your limits, challenging your skills and mastering a craft.&quot;  She adds that &quot;every woman has important stories to tell and the ability to tell them.&quot;  Her book will help women develop that ability.	2001-11-05

A chapter titled &quot;How to Ask for What You Want&quot; explains how to make specific and clear requests, and how to avoid internal sabotage when you desire something.<br /> Scheinfeld says &quot;so much of what creates your daily life, what shapes your thoughts and feelings, and what happens to you is invisible--behind the scenes.&quot;  The purpose behind The Invisible Path to Success is to &quot;map out enough streets, roads, and highways . . . to navigate where we really want to go.&quot;  Readers will find the path mapped by Scheinfeld a useful tool in achieving the success they desire.	2001-11-05

People who undergo past life regression discover that they lived many other lifetimes, in a variety of bodies.  Both kinds of experience appear equally valid.  How can we change bodies with each lifetime, yet appear to those who love us in the same body in which they last saw us?<br /> Peter Novak attempts to answer this question in his book, The Division of Consciousness:  The Secret Afterlife of the Human Psyche.  Novak spent ten years studying psychology, theology, thanatology, comparative religion, biblical archaeology, past-life regressions, and near death experiences before formulating his theories.  He says that &quot;we still don't understand death or agree about it at all.  Our sciences don't agree, our religions don't agree, our ideas don't even agree.&quot;<br /> Novak says that we are composed of three parts:  body, mind, and soul.  Only the body &quot;dies&quot; at death:  the mind and soul continue.  He refers to the mind as &quot;conscious&quot; and the soul as &quot;unconscious,&quot; and believes the conscious and unconscious split from each other after death.  He has named this &quot;Division Theory.&quot;  Division Theory, he says, reconciles the &quot;East's doctrine of reincarnation and the West's doctrine of heaven and hell.&quot;<br /> He analyzes various theologies and philosophies, showing how Division Theory reconciles traditional differences.  His assertions are carefully documented and supported.<br /><br /> Readers may or may not agree with Novak's Division Theory.  As Novak says, &quot;something profound changed&quot; when he began his research.  &quot;A door opened; a  new perspective dawned; an alternate possibility presented itself.&quot;  Considering the theories presented in The Division of Consciousness will enable readers to open their own doors to what happens in the afterlife.	2001-09-15

O'Neill defines the guiding principles of spiritual destiny as life's work, issues to resolve, spiritual contracts, awareness of past lifetimes, and maintenance of the human body.<br /> Life's work refers to what you are on earth to accomplish.  O'Neill includes a list key indicators that will help you determine if you're on the right path.<br /><br /> &quot;An issue is a learning or growing experience that helps an individual evolve emotionally and spiritually.&quot;  Issues represent the struggles and problems that humans have to work though.  They're meant to be learning experiences and they include such  emotions as loneliness, rejection, grief, and fear.<br /> Spiritual contracts refers to our relationships with others.  O'Neill believes that we all make agreements with others,  before we are born, &quot;to interact with each other during an upcoming earthly lifetime.&quot;  These agreements are generally made to help each other achieve spiritual growth in a particular area.<br /> Being aware of past lives means recognizing that we've already achieved certain amounts of spiritual growth.  This awareness contributes to our self-esteem and ability to cope with our current life, because we know we've reached our goals in the past.<br /> Caring for our physical bodies is important because they help support the soul while on earth.  &quot;If your body's well-being is compromised, it could impede or completely derail your spiritual forward movement.&quot;<br /> O'Neill has packed Discover Your Spiritual Destiny full of exercises and techniques that will help readers learn the purpose of their life on earth and find peace and happiness.now we've reached our goals in the past.<br /> Caring for our physical bodies is important because they help support the soul while on earth.  &quot;If your body's well-being is compromised, it could impede or completely derail your spiritual forward movement.&quot;<br /> O'Neill has packed Discover Your Spiritual Destiny full of exercises and techniques that will help readers learn the purpose of their life on earth and find peace and happiness.	2001-09-15

It's the story of a young Navajo boy who survived an attack on his people by the &quot;blue coats&quot; (U.S. federal forces sent to relocate them). Not only must he escape from the blue coats, he's also pursued by Two-Face, a Ute Indian bent on destroying him. The boy, Tobachischin, has only the contents of his grandfather's magic pouch with which to defend himself. These include an arrow straightener, a horsehair whip, a porcupine quill comb, some red powder, and a blue bead called the coyote bead. Each item has been invested with powerful magic, and each, in turn, saves Tobachischin from death. The coyote bead must be reunited with a white coyote bead, carried by Two-Face. Tobachischin must therefore meet face-to-face with his powerful enemy. When the meeting takes place, Tobachischin uses his courage and cunning to defeat Two-Face. He then continues on his quest to live in the mountains with the remnants of his people. The story is a retelling of the near-destruction of the Navajo people and their renewal. They practice a coyote beadway ceremony, designed to &quot;balance the opposing energies of peace and violence, harmony and war.&quot; The Navajo recovered from the devastating losses imposed upon them by the blue coats and are today a thriving nation. Although Coyote Bead is written for young adults, I think its meant for people of all ages, as I'm in the fifth decade of my life, and the story entranced me. Hausman is a skilled and exceptionally poetic writer. His work can be savored simply for good storytelling, as well for a personal understanding of a tragic event in American history.	2001-08-27

And most of us are puzzled by the fragments we can recall of these elusive visitors. Do dreams mean anything? If so, what? How can we better remember them? Is it possible to &quot;control&quot; our dreams? Sandra Thomson, a psychologist and author, tells readers all about dreams in Cloud Nine: A Dreamer's Dictionary. Thomson says that &quot;dreams show us our conflicts and way to resolve them; they chronicle our inner striving.&quot; She adds that dreams can be &quot;a second language.&quot; She starts with a general discussion of dreams, highlighting the primary theories of the significance of dreams. People have tried to understand their dreams since the beginning of time, often relying on shamans. The first dream book was written in the second century A.D. Hundreds of people have studied and attempted to explain dreams since then. Freud was a pioneer in dream interpretation. Thomson explains his theories, then goes on the discuss the work of other researchers, including Jung, Adler, Horney, and Perls. She clearly explains what each believed to be true about dreams, which is helpful to readers trying to understand the symbolism of their own dreams. Dreams use symbols and the meaning of the symbols vary from person to person. Thomson highly recommends that each person prepare their own &quot;dream dictionary,&quot; in which they figure out the meaning of their unique symbols. The bulk of her book is a generalized dream dictionary that will help readers get started. She offers alternative meanings for most of the symbols, enabling users to better interpret their dreams. She provides extensive instructions for decoding individual dreams. The book is filled with &quot;dreamercises,&quot; which are designed to assist in recalling and interpreting dreams. Thomson also explains how to put your dreams to work for you, by asking for solutions to daytime problems. She also describes how to teach yourself how to have lucid dreams, in which the dreamers are aware that they are dreaming before they wake up. Thomson wrote Cloud Nine to &quot;allow you to participate more fully in understanding your own dream productions or in identifying your growth tasks.&quot; The guidelines and exercises she provides gives readers the tools they need to understand and interpret their dreams.which the dreamers are aware that they are dreaming before they wake up.

Although people regard inflammation as undesirable, Moore says it is a necessary part of the healing process.  She adds that &quot;inflammation may, however, develop at times and at sites with an intensity that is harmful, and the weapons intended to destroy invading elements or noxious stimuli may turn against the body itself.&quot;<br /> Moore describes exactly how the immune system recognizes and attacks foreign substances, and how that system sometimes becomes overwhelmed and breaks down, leading to chronic illnesses.  She explains how the body chemicals and anti-inflammatory agents work together and how inadequate nutritional intake weaken those functions.<br /> Moore says herbalism is a holistic approach that &quot;assists in resolving the condition while alleviating pain and discomfort.  It is not aimed at simply alleviating symptoms, it also focuses on liver function, circulation and elimination, as well as quality of life.&quot;  She adds that herbs primarily stimulate both anti-inflammatory and metabolic functions.<br /> The bulk of her book is devoted to describing the various herbs, how they work, and recommended dosages.  She offers specific diet and nutritional information, as well as herbal treatments, for these common inflammatory diseases:  allergies and asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and eczema.  She ends with a materia medica which lists the common herbs and how to use them.

Dr. Susan E. Brown explains it all in her book, Better Bones, Better Body, a &quot;comprehensive self-help program for preventing, halting and overcoming osteoporosis.&quot;<br /> A medical anthropologist and certified nutritionist, Dr. Brown currently directs the Osteoporosis Project and the Nutrition Education and Consulting Service.  She says that osteoporosis is a &quot;needless disorder [that] barely exists in much of the world.&quot;  It is &quot;a disease of Western civilization created by our lifestyles.&quot;  Because it's a disease we have created, it is one we can eliminate.<br /> Dr. Brown says her extensive research enables her to say that &quot;I now know that osteoporosis is preventable and that it can be halted once begun.  I also know that it is to some degree reversible.&quot;  Her book details precisely what causes osteoporosis and how to prevent its development.<br /> Although many of us think of bone as being something that is solid and unchanging, it is actually living tissue.  Old bone tissue is constantly being dissolved and replaced with new bone.  Dr. Brown says that &quot;every atom in our skeleton is replaced within a three-month period.&quot;  While calcium is certainly a key player in building new bones, it doesn't work alone.  At least 17 other nutrients are needed.  The standard American diet either doesn't provide those nutrients, or provides them in inadequate quantities.  Not only are most Americans slighted on the essential nutrients, they consume too much animal protein.  Calcium is actually withdrawn from bone tissue in order to metabolize protein, which contributes to the development of osteoporosis.<br /> Dr. Brown explains how to evaluate your personal risk of developing osteoporosis.  She offers hope when she says &quot;it is never too late to begin building healthy bone.  Even the aged confined to wheelchairs have been able to build bone mass with simple exercises and modest nutritional supplementation.&quot;  Dr. Brown then provides comprehensive instructions for individualizing a program to suit your needs.  The basics of osteoporosis prevention and reversal are sound nutritional practices and regular strength-building exercise.  Dr. Brown offers guidelines and examples for making those basics a part of your lifestyle.<br /> Not only is Better Bones, Better Health a must-read for every Western woman, it's also essential for men and adolescents.

He explains how to determine what is is that you really want from life, and why you don't yet have it.  He offers practical advice on goal setting and achieving goals.

He then shows you how to commit to your goal and reward yourself for each step taken.<br /> His success blueprint shows you &quot;how to activate your thought processes--mental muscles--and to draw on your own form of genius.&quot;  He adds that we each &quot;have the ability of perform at exceptional levels in at least one area of your life if you can find it.&quot;  He teaches you how to find and develop that area.  Part of his training is a &quot;30-day mental diet&quot; that emphasizes thinking about your life's purpose and how to best accomplish it.<br /> Turner also discusses the importance of spending quiet time with yourself and learning to listen to your intuition.<br />  &quot;How tall does a tree grow?&quot; Turner asks, then answers:  &quot;As tall as it can.&quot;  He advises us to imitate trees, and grow as much as we can.  We all have unlimited potential for growth, and it is only our own way of thinking that keeps us pruned into shrubs instead of tall trees.

It either doesn't see the light that awaits it, or fails to turn to the light.  And sometimes these confused spirits attach themselves to new living bodies, interfering with the soul that already inhabits that body.  In Freeing the Captives: The Emerging Therapy of Treating Spirit Attachment, hypnotherapist Louise Ireland-Frey, M.D. details how and why these &quot;obsessing entities&quot; must be released.<br /> A pioneer in &quot;spirit releasement therapy,&quot; Dr. Ireland-Frey practiced medicine until 1979.  At age 67, she then began a new career as a hypnotherapist.  Since then she has studied with others doing releasement and helped hundreds of clients.<br /> Dr. Ireland-Frey believes there are two parts to releasement:  the living person must first have the obsessing entity freed from it; and then the freed entity must be shown the way to light, so that it finds its proper place and doesn't attach itself to others.<br /> Releasement is also known as &quot;dispossession&quot; by other practitioners.<br /> Persons who have attached spirits may experience personality changes, become inexplicably depressed, or find themselves doing things they normally wouldn't do.  Dr. Ireland-Frey has included dozens of case studies that illustrate how attached spirits affect people, and how she, and other practitioners, have released them.<br /> &quot;The earthbound souls of deceased human beings are by far the most commonly found kind of obsessing or oppressing entity,&quot; according to Dr. Ireland-Frey.  There are, however, various other kinds of entitles, such as past-life personalities, negative thought-forms, elementals, and &quot;dark beings of a demonic nature.&quot;  The obsessing entities can occupy physical locations, such as homes, as well as living bodies.  For those readers interested in helping others with releasement, the final chapter offers basic instructions and cautions.  Dr. Ireland-Frey says &quot;the need is great; many souls are wandering or hiding, some in bewilderment, some in fear of hell, some in fear of continuing terrors of war, abuse, or betrayal.&quot;  She urges readers to &quot;reach out to these souls and rescue or release some of these needy ones.&quot;  Practitioners must take care, however, to first protect themselves from possession.<br /> Freeing the Captives sheds new light on the age-old problem of possession and offers hope and encouragement to those whom invading entities have attached themselves, as well as providing guidance to those wishing to help free the living person and the obsessing entity.-Frey says &quot;the need is great; many souls are wandering or hiding, some in bewilderment, some in fear of hell, some in fear of continuing terrors of war, abuse, or betrayal.&quot;  She urges readers to &quot;reach out to these souls and rescue or release some of these needy ones.&quot;  Practitioners must take care, however, to first protect themselves from possession.<br /> Freeing the Captives sheds new light on the age-old problem of possession and offers hope and encouragement to those whom invading entities have attached themselves, as well as providing guidance to those wishing to help free the living person and the obsessing entity.	2001-07-03

For example, he suggests that if you're right-handed, try using your left hand to hold a key and unlock a door.<br /> Parlette first dispels common myths about brains, such as whether brain power depends on brain size.  He also says that intelligence is &quot;an individual measure of how we employ the brain power and the talents we have been given.  In other words, intelligent people make the most of what they have.&quot;  His exercises are all designed to help stimulate your brain to enable you to make the most of what you have.<br /> He offers a simple quiz for determining how fit your brain is.  He says &quot;a fit brain welcomes new interactions, new challenges, new experiences.&quot;  We have to get out of our daily rut.  His first exercise is to simply &quot;take a completely different route home from work&quot; once a week.<br /> One section of the book discusses the functions of the right brain and the left brain, and how to stimulate each side.  Putting together a jigsaw puzzle is a right brain stimulus, while working a crossword puzzle delights the left-brain.  Reciting written material, such as a poem, aloud gets both halves of the brain working together.<br /> Parlette then explains the different kinds of memory and provides exercises that help increase the ability to remember.  He also includes a chapter on exercising your imagination through daydreaming.  Another section of his book describes special brain exercises for writers, artists, actors, musicians, scientists, and athletes.  He also discusses how to rest the brain when suffering from mental fatigue.<br /> &quot;For exercise our brain wants stimulation, fresh stimulation, new stimulation.

Dr. Stevenson has chosen the angel art of William Blake, Gustave Dore, and Albrecht Durer to illustrate his book.<br /> Appendices include a reading list for those wanting more information, a list of movies about angels, a glossary of angelic terms, and a &quot;Who's Who in Heaven,&quot; which provides a brief description of each angel.<br /> As Dr. Stevenson says, &quot;angels have been, and still are, a part of all faiths and cultures.&quot;  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Angels is an excellent reference for readers interested in the origins of angel lore and the interactions between angels and humans, whether historical or contemporary.	2001-05-03

It's a useful book, read from cover-to-cover, but the authors designed it for browsing.  Simply flip through the pages until you find the specific information you need.<br /> Arnold A. Lazarus, Ph.D. is an internationally-renowned psychologist, who has published several books and hundreds of articles, and has been honored as &quot;one of the ten most influential psychotherapists of our time.&quot;  His son, Clifford N. Lazarus, Ph.D. has also published books and articles, as well as maintained an active consulting practice.  The two doctors participated in a radio talk show named Mental Health Matters, and drew much of the material in their current book from that show.<br /> Because of that, the material is presented in easy-to-understand terms and emphasizes the practical aspects of achieving good mental health.<br /> Drs. Lazarus divided the book into several main sections with titles like:  Strategies for Staying Sane, Building Successful Relationships, Communicating Effectively, and Dealing with Depression, Anger and Moods.  Each section is further divided into chapters.<br /> The chapters are succinct, rarely more than a page or two long.  Each starts with a real-life example, followed by an explanation of why the situation in the example occurs.  Tips for overcoming each type of situation are shown in bold-face type, making them easy to find.<br /> While some people may need long-term therapy, the doctors believe that many people simply need help in finding solutions to mental health problems.

He spent more than ten years as a private detective before turning to writing about murder.  He's also a criminology instructor.  His latest book is A Murder: From the Chalk Outline to the Execution Chamber, in which he &quot;examines murder as a process--a series of actions, events, and operations conducing toward an end.&quot;<br /> He starts with the observation that people are both repelled and fascinated by murder.  While we generally regard the taking of someone's life as the most serious of all crimes, we've also incorporated murder into our entertainment.  Fallis notes that &quot;films, televison programs, novels, theatrical plays, computer games, even board games revolve around murder.&quot;&lt;P  The book is divided into five sections: what constitutes murder; how murders are investigated, including the arrest process; how the defense system works; the trial and jury deliberations; and the punishment, which includes a description of exactly what happens to a body when it's subjected to execution.<br /> Fallis starts with a murder--a man rapes and kills a woman, then hides the body.  He uses this to kick off the discussion of the kinds of murder, such as manslaughter and the reasons why people kill one another.  The remainder of the book follows this pattern--a fictionalized case used to illustrate the common elements of all murders.<br /> In addition to providing information on how and why murder happens, and how the murderer is apprehended and punished, Fallis reminds readers to &quot;periodically remind yourself of the enormity of the act.  To kill another person is an act of tremendous presumption.&quot;<br /> Readers, whether repelled or fascinated by murder, will find that A Murder is an excellent reference that answers all their questions about what happens when one person kills another.	2001-05-03

Amphibians are animals that, with only a few exceptions, spend part of their life in water, and part on land.  Scientists so far have identified more than 4,500 species of amphibians.  Frogs are probably the best-known amphibians.<br /> Steve Grenard's latest book, Amphibians:  Their Care and Keeping, is an essential reference for anyone interested in these fascinating creatures.  Grenard is a herpetologist with more than thirty years experience with amphibians.<br /> He starts with the evolutionary history of amphibians, a story that &quot;began some 350 million years ago during the Devonian period.&quot;  Today, they're the &quot;most numerous of all living vertebrates, [and] have adapted to virtually every climatic and geographic locale, save for full-strength sea-water.&quot;<br /> Grenard then describes the biology of amphibians, explaining how they eat, sleep, and reproduce.  He also explains how they defend themselves against predators.  He devotes one chapter to taxonomy, listing the three orders of amphibians:  limbless (cecillians); tailed (salamanders and newts); and tailless (frogs and toads).<br /> The second section of the book describes how to care for captive amphibians.  He starts with how to chose the best animal and where you can find healthy specimens.  He then provides information on how to provide the best home for your pet.  He says that &quot;amphibians are primarily for display, study and exhibit purposes--they should not be handled any more than is absolutely necessary.&quot;  He describes the procedures to follow when handling is required, such as when cleaning the cage.<br /> Most amphibians eat live foods.  Grenard explains food preferences and offers tips on obtaining the correct foods.  He also describes good health care, both to prevent a diseased pet, and the transmission of disease from animal to human.<br /> He finishes with a discussion of conservation and legal protection.  Some amphibians are already extinct, and others are endangered.  Grenard also incudes listings of resources in the appendices, including national and international societies, finding a knowledgeable veterinarian, and habitat and equipment suppliers.<br /> Amphibians: Their Care and Keeping is a must-have book for anyone contemplating sharing their home with these creatures.tection.

Author Jack Challem, who has written extensively in the health field, says that &quot;hormones are unquestionably among medicine's most powerful, more remarkable drugs.&quot;<br /> The body produces at least 200 different hormones.  Challem chose the ten most common to describe in detail:  melatonin, DHEA, pregnenolone, estrogen, testosterone, insulin, thyroid, adrenocortical, and human growth hormones.  Challem gives a brief explanation of how each hormone works, and the symptoms of hormonal imbalance.  He then discusses natural alternatives for each.<br /> Challem also includes advice from several medical doctors, who warn people about the dangers of taking hormones indiscriminately.  He also condemns the aggressive marketing efforts of the major drug companies.  He quotes Dr. Susan Love as saying that &quot;one of the most powerful marketing techniques used to influence both doctors and patients is the manipulation of fears of aging and death.&quot;  Challem emphasizes that &quot;there's no agreement about the benefits of hormones when used as an antiaging therapy.&quot;<br /> Hormone therapy has, of course, saved many lives, as the millions of people taking insulin for diabetes will attest.  Challem's message to people is that hormones &quot;are drugs, and they are very powerful drugs.&quot;  Just because many of them are easily available OTC doesn't mean they are safe.  The ABCs of Hormones will provide readers with the basic information they need to decide whether or not they should take supplemental hormones, and if so, how much and in what form.	2001-05-03

Therapeutic Touch is based on several principles, two of which are &quot;illness is an imbalance in an individual's energy field&quot; and &quot;human beings have natural abilities to transform and transcend their conditions of living.&quot;<br /> Therapeutic Touch was developed and refined by Dr. Dolores Krieger and Dora Kunz, based on their studies of ancient healing practices.

The process involves &quot;centering&quot; yourself, then becoming sensitive to the energy fields all living beings have.<br /> Therapeutic Touch can be used to help people relax, to reduce pain, and accelerate healing.  Dr. Krieger provides numerous examples of benefits, including relief from the pain of cancer, headaches, burns, and fractured bones.  Therapeutic Touch is also helpful to pregnant women and people suffering from chronic conditions like asthma.  Some people have also used it to help their pets, while others have used it in their gardens.<br /> Accepting Your Power to Heal has been on the book stands for several years.  The method outlined in it has been proven time and again to be beneficial to people suffering from various illnesses, including AIDS.

Mark Smith, in Auras: See Them in Only 60 Seconds!, takes only a couple pages to describe the basic technique.  He then takes a couple more pages explaining how to practice so that you can see auras whenever you want to.  In all, there's only ten steps to learn and practice.<br /> But there's lots more to auras than just seeing them.  Smith goes on to explain what some of the auras you might see mean, and how to put auric knowledge to work for you.  Auras are one of the many tools people can use to increase their awareness of what's going on with other people, from deceit to illness.  Auras can also help individuals tap into healing energies and therapies.  He says his life was probably &quot;saved by the use of bioenergy and therapeutic techniques involved in healing through the auric field.&quot;<br /> Most people see colors when they see the aura, and each color means something.  Smith says it's very important &quot;to look at your aura on a daily basis.&quot;  He says you'll see changes in the colors or the intensity of the colors that will give you clues about your health.  And if you dress in colors that match your aura, you'll find more harmony throughout your day!<br /> Meditating or concentrating on specific colors can help with certain ailments.  For example, focusing on blue will help overcome insomnia, while visualizing yellow is energizing.<br /> Smith is also a performing artist, and has been in contact with many celebrities.  He includes a discussion of the auras of people who are either famous and/or charismatic.  People can look for auras as a way of better understanding themselves and others.  They can also use them to improve their daily lives because &quot;learning about the aura is one way to gauge and monitor our health on an entirely different scale, and this knowledge can be used to augment our growing awareness of the effects that various aspects of our environment have on us.&quot;  Auras: See Them in Only 60 Seconds! teaches readers everything they need to know to develop their own auric abilities and improve their lives and the lives of those with whom they come in contact.ot;  Auras: See Them in Only 60 Seconds! teaches readers everything they need to know to develop their own auric abilities and improve their lives and the lives of those with whom they come in contact.	2001-05-03

As an adult, he learned how to project himself into the astral realm at will.  He combines his experiences and more than twenty-five years of research in his newest book, Astral Dynamics: A NEW Approach to Out-of-Body Experience.<br /> NEW is capitalized because it stands for New Energy Ways, a technique for raising energy that Bruce developed.  Projecting oneself from one's body requires high energy levels, and Bruce devotes one section of the book to energy skills.<br /> He emphasizes that persons who project themselves do not leave behind an &quot;empty body&quot; that can be harmed.  Instead, &quot;one full copy of thinking mind and memory--conscious and subconscious--stays at all times within the bounds of the physical body. . .This original or master copy never leaves the bounds of the physical body while it still lives.&quot;<br />Nevertheless, it is important to prepare oneself first and establish a good foundation for safety before attempting an out-of-body projection.<br /> Bruce provides very detailed instructions for each step.  Although most projectors have positive experiences, occasionally something negative can happen.  He describes all these potential problems and how to overcome them.  He also describes all the wonderful things that projectors can see while out of their bodies.<br /> Projectors can pass through solid objects, like walls.  They can travel to the house next door or to galaxies beyond this one.  They can search the Akashic Records.  Advanced projectors can visit the spirit worlds.  There doesn't seem to be any limit on where projectors can go or what they can do.<br /> Bruce says that &quot;consciously projecting out of body is nowhere as difficult as commonly believed.  It is simply a matter of deeply relaxing the physical body, clearing the mind, then triggering the projection reflex with an exit technique.&quot;  He describes all the skills needed and provides exercises for developing those skills.  After that, it's simply a matter of practicing until you're successful.<br /> He says his primary goal is &quot;to create a user-friendly, readable and useful tutorial, guide, and reference work for all who aspire to travel out of their bodies.&quot;  Readers of Astral Dynamics will find that his book easily meets that goal.and provides exercises for developing those skills.

Peterson, Ph.D. suffered for years from procrastination.  With The Tomorrow Trap: Unlocking the Secrets of the Procrastination-Protection Syndrome, she has written the book she &quot;needed to read 20 years ago--while fighting a never-ending battle with procrastination.&quot;<br /> Rather than offer ways in which to change behavior, Peterson focuses on helping readers discover the emotional reasons for their procrastination.  Once the underlying problem is resolved, the procrastination often disappears.<br /> Dr. Peterson describes two kinds of procrastination:  task-related, and person-related.  She emphasizes that procrastination is not laziness.  If you are putting off doing &quot;an arduous and unpleasant task,&quot; you are probably suffering from task-related procrastination.  That's the kind that can be best overcome with a reward system.<br /> &quot;When you start to feel extremely angry, victimized, or helpless,&quot; then person-related procrastination is likely the culprit.  Dr. Peterson says this type of procrastination &quot;protects&quot; us from dealing with &quot;other issues not yet faced.&quot;  Understanding that, she says, puts us on the road to recovery.<br /> A psychologist and stress management consultant, Dr. Peterson uses case studies of clients to provide examples of how people can overcome procrastination and lead productive lives.  Each chapter has questions that readers can ask themselves to help reveal the hidden emotions that keep them enmeshed in the tomorrow trap.  She also provides exercises for freeing oneself from the past.<br /> One chapter discusses compulsive habits, such as uncontrolled overeating, overspending, and workaholism as facets of procrastination.  Dr. Peterson explains how those habits are formed and how they may be overcome.<br /> Another chapter lists some medical reasons, such as PMS, ADHD, and SAD, that can lead to procrastination, and what to do about them.<br /> Procrastination creates problems in all aspects of our lives: personal, professional, and spiritual.  The Tomorrow Trap provides the incentive and self-help techniques needed to &quot;break free from the procrastination patterns of the past and embrace a new way of living, working and believing.&quot;l aspects of our lives: personal, professional, and spiritual.

They explain that &quot;prayer is all about relationship with God, regardless of the images and names we use to build that relationship.&quot;<br /> They discuss the different forms that prayer can take, and explain the differences between prayer and meditation.  Prayer is not an exercise or a convenience, they say, but rather &quot;it is a human necessity and Divine commandment.&quot;  They add that &quot;your prayer relationship will be private, intimate and uniquely yours.&quot;<br /> Although prayer is a natural action, sometimes it's hard to find the time to pray, or to know just how to go about it.  Nassal and Burke suggest forming the habit of prayer by reserving a time and place for prayer--to plan a time for prayer just as we plan time to eat, sleep, or mow the lawn.  They say &quot;cultivating a prayerful life is no different&quot; than cultivating other good habits.  They offer specific tips on how regular prayer can be made a part of even the busiest life.<br /> Although they maintain that prayer is a private process and that each will find &quot;your own voice and words,&quot; Nassal and Burke devote the second half of the book to printed prayers as assistance to those who need it.  They grouped the prayers into classifications such as gratitude and thanksgiving, petition, and praise.<br /> How To Pray is for all those seeking a closer relationship with the Divine in their lives.	2001-03-20

Domin provides an interpretation to match every variance.<br /> For those interested in more depth, Domin offers the history of palmistry in her introduction.  She says that &quot;Aristotle was the first to maintain that the grooves, creases, and lines in the palm are a result of nervous and muscular interplay directed by the brain.&quot;<br /> Domin further explains that &quot;a large percentage of nerve fibers leading from the brain are projected towards the outer extremities&quot; and that &quot;information stored in the brain is then projected upon the surface of the palm, like a video camera projects an image through a network of cables onto a screen.&quot;<br /> The final chapter of the book is directed to those who want to become a professional palmist, with instructions and tips for reading the palms of others for a fee.

Pendulums are commonly used in grandfather clocks.  Pendulums have another, far more ancient use, however.  For thousands of years, they have been an essential part of divination.  Nielsen and Polansky say &quot;the pendulum is  simply one method of many for communing consciously with our deeper being and allowing it to guide our everyday actions.&quot;<br /> Their book introduces readers to the extensive history of the pendulum, from early divination to 20th-century medical practice.  They then explain how the energy that is a part of every living organism makes the pendulum work.  They say that the human nervous system &quot;is the communication system of the body&quot; and using a pendulum allows you to interpret the signals your &quot;inner higher intelligence [communicates] through the nervous system.&quot;<br /> Pendulums are very easy and inexpensive to make.  A ring or button suspended from thread makes a simple pendulum.  For readers wanting something more elegant, the authors provide detailed instructions for constructing a pendulum from doweling.  Extensive directions are given for using pendulums.  Readers will learn what kinds of questions to ask, and how to interpret the various movements of the pendulum.

Doyle III, writes that &quot;thoughts and beliefs are the basic elements of all creation.  They exist as tiny waves of energy called thoughtforms, whose sole purpose is to carry out the intent of the thinker.&quot;  He further explains that the lives we live, whether happy or miserable, are the direct result of what we think.<br /> Doyle uses real-life situations to show how our underlying &quot;core&quot; beliefs are developed, and how thoughtforms are created that support those beliefs.  The thoughts and beliefs lead to feelings, which then lead to reactions.  Those reactions determine our life's experience, leading Doyle to maintain that &quot;beliefs determine experience.&quot;<br /> He says &quot;the good news is that with the recognition that you are creating your own life, you can start taking charge--as the designer of your life, no longer a victim of life's random circumstances.  You become self-responsible.&quot;  He explains how developing a positive attitude can change beliefs, and thus change experiences.  He offers suggestions for developing positive attitudes so as to get whatever it is that you want from life.<br /> He adds that we can't avoid unpleasant feelings, but we can experience them, and then move on.

They also show how millennial beliefs made their way into fairy tales and folklore, and how those beliefs affected the daily lives of ordinary people.<br /> The chapter on contemporary America discusses the rapid technological advances made in the past hundred years, the &quot;psychic apocalypse&quot; of mass genocide, the development of our ability to totally destroy the world with nuclear weapons, and the proliferation of deadly diseases like AIDS.

Balancing Expectation &amp; Disappointment in Your Life, is for you.<br /> Dr. Brandt, a psychologist, has studied disappointment for more than 20 years.  He lectures nationally and appears frequently on radio and television.  His goal is to &quot;unwrap the mysteries of [disappointment], show the variety of human responses to it, and reveal, surprisingly, how each of us can use disappointment for our own gain.&quot;<br /> He say that disappointment is simply an unmet expectation.  &quot;We expected something to happen; it did not; we are disappointed.&quot;  He adds that &quot;expectation is simply the anticipation of an outcome.&quot;  Wishes underlie expectations, and  also serve as motivators.  &quot;It is the wish within each expectation that hooks us and maintains our emotional investment.&quot;<br /> Dr. Brandt defines the various causes of disappointment and offers tips and techniques for learning how to minimize their impact on your life.  He also describes personality styles, such as the acquiescent person who gives up personal desires to please others, and how they lead to disappointment.

Dr. Brandt provides six practical principles for developing realistic expectations and then teaches readers steps to overcome disappointment when it does occur.<br /> The final chapter, &quot;Making Disappointment Work For You&quot; focuses on making disappointment &quot;an ally in the search for contentment and personal happiness.&quot;<br /> Readers wanting to learn how to avoid depression and energy loss resulting from disappointment will find Is That All There Is? teaches the skills they need to convert disappointment to a positive force in their lives.	2001-03-09

Their book is intended for people who are tired of struggling and wish to &quot;sign a peace treaty with life.&quot;<br /> Finley and Dickstein explain that &quot;we each have, and operate from, a false nature that is a jumble of our memories, conditioning, and some tempermental qualities.&quot;  That false self responds to everything that happens to us, and its response is usually negative or defensive.  We then find &quot;ourselves caught up in the same kinds of situations again and again, and nothing ever seems to be resolved in a new way.&quot;<br /> They call the false self an intimate enemy and say that we are our own worst enemies when it comes to finding true happiness.<br /> Their book devoted to learning how to recognize the intimate enemy and &quot;discover how to rise above our own present psychology.&quot;<br /> Our false selves blame events outside ourselves for our unhappiness or see neutral events as threats, with the result that we are contantly battling to control external circumstances.  Only when we become aware of the &quot;True Self&quot; within do we learn we are a part of a world of truth and light where all battles are non-existent.<br /> The authors use short stories and examples to show how people misunderstand the world around them.  They explain how to become aware of the fallacies the false self continually attempts to foist off as truth, and how to determine what is real and what is deceit.  They say that &quot;understanding that we are a multiplicity of selves is critical to recognizing, and ultimately defeating, the intimate enemy.&quot;<br /> They emphasize self-study as the primary way of overcoming the false self.  Self-study involves rousing ourselves from &quot;psychic slumber&quot; and becoming aware of our thoughts and internal actions.  They offer specific tips for achieving greater self-awareness.<br /> The Intimate Enemy is for anyone who wants more from life than a daily battle against unseen enemies.elf-awareness.<br /> The Intimate Enemy is for anyone who wants more from life than a daily battle against unseen enemies.	2001-03-09

Like everything else that spins, it wobbles.  That wobble is technically called precession, and it explains why Earthlings have seen the sun rise against different constellations over the centuries.  In his latest book, Maya Cosmogenesis 2012: The True Meaning of the Maya Calendar End-Date, John Major Jenkins explains how the Maya mapped the movements of the Earth, including precession, and incorporated their measurements into their calendars.<br /> Jenkins, who has researched Mesoamerican cosmology and calendrics since 1986, has written five other books and numerous articles about the Maya.  In Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, he ties together Mayan mythology and astronomy in a scholarly discussion of the source and meaning of &quot;end date&quot; indicated by the Long Count calendar.<br /> He supports his theories with nearly 200 line drawings, and provides extensive appendices, end notes, and a comprehensive bibliography.<br />  Each &quot;wobble&quot; (or precessional cycle) lasts 25,800 years.  Researchers believe that the current precessional cycle will end in the year 2012.  This date is known as the &quot;End-Date&quot; in Maya calendrics.  At that time, the Earth will begin a new cycle in the opposite direction.<br /> Jenkins says his focus is &quot;on how the precession of the equinoxes was mapped and calibrated among the ancient civilizations.&quot;  He adds that his book &quot;is devoted to exploring the Maya's understanding of the 2012 end-date and the philosophy and cosmology that go with it.  This is a book about cosmogenesis, the creation of the world.  The Maya believed that the world will be reborn, in a sense 're-created,' in the year we call 2012.&quot;<br /> What does all that mean?  Will humans survive cosmogenesis?  Jenkins thinks we will.  He says the end-date marks the beginning of a new and better world.  He believes that &quot;what looms before us is a great opportunity for spiritual growth, both individual and planetary.&quot;  Others, of course, disagree, and foresee a time of cataclysmic destruction.<br /> Regardless of whether they see the predicted end-date as a non-event, as destructive, or as an opportunity for growth, readers will find Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 a fascinating book.

You Decide	Genetic engineering &quot;is probably the largest nutritional experiment the world has ever seen, and we are the guinea pigs&quot; say Laura and Robin Ticciati in their book, Genetically Engineered Foods: Are They Safe?  You Decide.  They answer with a resounding &quot;No!&quot; to the question of whether genetically engineered foods are safe.<br /> The Ticciatis briefly define genes and DNA, then explain how genetic engineers insert the genes from one organism into another.  Genes from flounders, for example, have been inserted in tomato DNA to produce a tomato that has a longer growing season.  They maintain that genetic engineering breaks natural crossbreeding rules because species are combined that would never mate in Nature.<br /> Their primary concern lies in the lack of knowlege of the long-term effects from eating genetically engineered foods.  They are especially concerned about children.  At the least, they want genetically engineered foods to be labeled so that consumers know what they are buying and eating.<br /> The authors say that &quot;Right now, it is estimated that 60-70 percent of the foods in our stores contain genetically engineered components&quot; with 100-150 more expected to be added by the year 2000.  &quot;These foods have not been subjected to thorough pre-market safety testing, nor are they labeled.&quot;<br /> Genetically Engineered Foods:  Are They Safe?

Williams in 1956.  It has just been reissued with a new introduction by Jeffrey S. Bland, Ph.D.  Dr. Bland explains that Dr. Williams was the first to recognize all humans differ biochemically from others.  He says that Dr. Williams was also the first to recognize that &quot;nutritional status can influence the expression of genetic characteristics.&quot;<br /> Dr. Williams conducted his own studies, as well as drawing on the work of others, to show that each of us is different.  One chapter describes differences in anatomy, outlining how even such vital organs as hearts and stomachs vary in size, shape, and physical location from person to person.<br /> The chapter on pharmacology explains how, even though the chemistry of each is known, drugs effect people in different ways, due to differences in body chemistry.  That's why what works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another.<br /> Dr. Williams says that &quot;while the same physical mechanisms and the same metabolic processes are operating in all human bodies, the structures are sufficiently diverse [that] the sum total of  all the reactions taking place in one individual's body may be very different from those taking place in the body of another individual of the same age, sex, and body size.&quot;<br /> His observations led Dr. Williams to theorize that each individual also had unique nutritional needs, and that determining and meeting those needs would help combat disease.<br /> Although written in academic language, Biochemical Individuality is of interest all readers who recognize &quot;there is no such thing as a truly 'normal' individual&quot; and that people have &quot;unique biochemical profiles based upon their own genetic structure, nutrition, and environment.&quot;	2001-02-28

According to them, significant changes which began in 1987 will culminate in 2012.  &quot;Our intention,&quot; the Pleiadians say, &quot;is to help you get through these times; ideally we will create openings of energy through you, so you can relax and understand who you are in this immense process of change.&quot;<br /> The changes now occurring help explain why qualities like responsibility, reliability, and compassion often seem to be missing from everyday life.  Civilization as we know it, the Pleiadians assert, is collapsing.  They want to help us change our perspectives, to help us in &quot;creating universes&quot; rather than &quot;destroying ourselves.&quot;  They say the universe is full of life, and that we are &quot;stellar stock.&quot;  We are not here by accident:  &quot;Everything is planned and the universe runs because it is planned.&quot;<br /> The Pleaidians say that we need to keep in mind the bigger picture when dealing with the stresses of everyday life.

They say the answers to our current problems won't come from increased technology or &quot;going faster.&quot;  They advise us to slow down and listen to &quot;natural sounds&quot; like birds singing.

But if not tombs, what was their purpose?  Christopher Dunn provides an answer in The Giza Power Plant: Technologies of Ancient Egypt.<br /> Dunn, who has &quot;worked with machines for over thirty-five years,&quot; became intrigued with the Grand Pyramid, which he says is &quot;the largest, most precisely built, and most accurately aligned building ever constructed in the world.&quot;  He knew it had a special purpose and set out to learn what that purpose was.<br /> His journey included carefully weighing all the theories to date as to the origin and purpose of the pyramids.  None of those theories fit all the known details and available artifacts.  Not trained as an archeologist or in traditional Egyptology, he used his own experience as a master craftsman and engineer to re-evaluate the existing evidence, as well as doing some original research.<br /> When he had compiled everything, Dunn concluded that the pyramids were built with a technology superior to any presently in use and that they were &quot;the power plants of the ancient Egyptians.&quot;  He says the builders of the pyramids used them to convert the Earth's &quot;vibrational energy into microwave energy.&quot;  That energy &quot;was most likely used for the same reasons we would use it today--to power machines and appliances.&quot;<br /> Photographs and illustrations explain and support his theories.<br /> Dunn hypothesizes a future in which the technology used by the ancients could be used to draw off seismic energy, not only providing a clean and inexhaustible energy source, but also eliminating the earthquakes caused by the accumulation of that energy within the Earth.<br /> The Giza Power Plant is a must-read for anyone interested in the fascinating story of who built the pyramids, how they did it, and why they built such massive structures with such precision.	2001-02-28

Enzymes are &quot;necessary for every chemical reaction in your body and the normal activity of your cells, tissues, fluids, and organs.&quot;<br /> The human body contains three types of enzymes:  metabolic, which are necessary for all body processes, such as breathing; pancreatic, which are required for digestion; and plant, which also aid in digestion.  While the pancreas produces some enzymes, the body gets most of its enzymes from fresh, raw foods.  A diet based on unprocessed foods is essential for good health.<br /> Symptoms of enzyme-deficient diets include &quot;allergies, fatigue, bloating, gas, indigestion, or any symptoms of undigested food,&quot; including &quot;rashes, hives, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, or constipation.&quot;<br /> Dr. Lee includes samples of the questionnaires and charts she uses to help diagnose enzyme deficiencies.  She also discusses the various kinds of tests that can be used, with information on how to obtain them.  All medical terms are explained with &quot;quick definition&quot; boxes on the same page, making it easy to follow her discussion.<br /> The first part of the book explains enzyme deficiencies and therapy in general terms.

During that time he traveled extensively, spending &quot;a lot of time in the woods with very little in my backpack, finding my food in the plants I gathered.&quot;  He took copious notes and presented &quot;wild gastronomy&quot; workshops, while also continuing his academic research and studies.<br /> Plants are listed by their Latin names, however the index includes the common names.<br /> Information for each plant includes a rating of how edible it is, how abundant it is, and where it grows.  Etymology of most names are provided also; thus readers learn that dandelion comes from the French words for lion's tooth, because of the shape of the leaves.<br /> Couplan describes how to prepare edible parts of the plant, and how they taste.  He also discusses the nutritive values and medicinal properties of each plant.  Where relevant, he provides information on other uses, such as dyes, soaps, and basketry.  Endangered species are noted.  The book does not include illustrations and is not intended for use as an identification manual.<br /> Anyone who has ever wondered if a particular plant  could be eaten, or how to harvest and prepare it, will find The Encyclopedia of Edible Plants of North America informative and interesting.  People wishing to add a little variety to their diet will find lots of suggestions, and those who use plants for healing will appreciate the medicinal details.	2001-02-28

It is intriguing--once started, it can't be put aside to finish later.  It is powerful, and mind-changing.  It is compelling, and unique.  But it is not easy.<br /> Katzenbach says &quot;my book is about overcoming my fear of madness.&quot;  She adds that &quot;I probably had to become crazy, in some way, and survive it before I could overcome that fear.&quot;<br /> She turned her spiritual journey into a story in order to heal herself and embrace all that she is, including the goddess within.  Through storytelling she found &quot;my soul--my murdered soul.  Alive.&quot;  She learns the eternal truth of birth, death, rebirth.<br /> Set in the Hudson Valley of New York state, much of the story occurs at the local Y, a place that is both a sanctuary and an asylum for women.  Katzenbach's story is filled with unforgettable characters, like Manda, who has been running for 27,000 years, Rulla, the &quot;Queen of the Y,&quot; and Benjamin, who understands far more than most five-year-olds.  Katzenbach expertly weaves together individual and community forces to reach a startling, yet inevitable, denouement.  She says &quot;if my book opens the door to [when] women will all tell their own stories of soul, in their own voice, then Swimming In Trees will have done for others what it did for me...&quot;  Swimming in Trees: A Story of Soul is a woman's book for women who struggling to recover their souls.

Thomas Yannios, M.D. makes it easier  to decide which products to purchase in The Food Report  Card.  Dr. Yannios has analyzed the labels of thousands of  foods, and compiled his results in a simple grade of A, B,  C, or D.<br />  &quot;You can make an enormous impact on your long-term  health, and even on your appearance,&quot; Dr. Yannios writes,  &quot;if you do nothing else during your normal food shopping but  select the A- and B-rated foods, and leave the C's and D's  on the shelves back at the store.&quot;<br />  Dr. Yannios believes that atherosclerosis (hardening of  the arteries) is the number one health problem for many  Americans.  He says that &quot;food significantly impacts&quot;  atherosclerosis, and that we can reduce the negative impact  by carefully choosing what we eat.  &quot;People are confused,&quot;  Dr. Yannios says, explaining that he wrote The Food Report  Card to help eliminate confusion and enable people to choose  foods that are good for them.<br />  He has grouped foods into categories, such as  beverages, cereals and grains, milk and dairy products, and  meats.  Each food within a category is then listed in  alphabetical order, such as chocolate milk and vegetable  juice in the beverage section.  Foods are then evaluated by  brand name.  For example, five brands of vegetable juice are  analyzed and graded.  He maintains that pattern for each  food category, analyzing 12,000 foods altogether.  All you  have to do is look up a specific food to quickly determine  whether it is an &quot;A&quot; food that you want to consume or a &quot;D&quot;  food you want to avoid.<br />  People who want to choose the healthiest processed  foods, but don't want to spend a lot of time calculating  nutritional values from confusing labels, will find The Food  Report Card informative and helpful.	2001-01-31

Rather than suffering from Graves' Disease, a  deadly thyroid disease, Hull had been poisoned by the food  and soft drinks she had consumed.<br />  A working mother with little time, Hull relied on  prepared foods.  She counted on diet drinks to help control  her weight.  She didn't realize how much aspartame  (Nutrasweet) she was consuming, and she didn't know until  almost too late that it was toxic to her system.  After her  recovery, she devoted her spare time to researching the  history of aspartame in food products.  Her book is the  result of those  years of research.<br />  She &quot;uncovered hundreds of documents contradicting the  NutraSweet Company's claim of product safety.&quot;  She quotes  statistics from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)  indicating that &quot;aspartame accounts for over 85% of the  adverse reactions to food additives reported to the FDA.&quot;  Those reactions include headaches, depression, dizziness,  seizures, and weight gain.  Several deaths have been  reported.  There is also evidence that aspartame contributes  to birth defects.<br />  Her book details how the FDA first determined that  aspartame was unsafe for humans, then later reversed itself.  She obtained documents revealing the chemicals that  constitute aspartame and how those chemicals behave in the  human body.<br />  Sweet Poison is a must-read for anyone consuming food  or drinks containing aspartame.  At the least, it will open  your eyes to what you're putting in your body.  It might  even save your life.	2001-01-31

Ford.  Ford  describes his 18 immune boosters and explains how you can  use them to  help prevent everything from colds to cancer,  naturally.<br />  Our immune systems are our first defense against any  type of illness and people with strong immune systems are  generally healthier than those with weak systems.  Medical  researchers have developed many techniques for strengthening  immune systems and Ford has &quot;put them all together to  combine the powers of body, mind and nutrition into a single  comprehensive program specifically designed to bolster  immunity.&quot;<br />  He adds that his immune boosters are &quot;do-it-yourself  strategies [that] embrace virtually every promising natural  therapy through which you can heal and empower your  immunity.&quot;  All the current natural techniques have been  summarized and combined into groupings that maximize their  benefits.  Specific sections include overcoming insomnia,  fighting off colds and infections, and defeating anxiety and  depression.<br />  Ford describes, in understandable layman's terms, what  the immune system is and how it works.  One chapter is  devoted to explaining how cancer overwhelms the immune  system, with suggestions on how to &quot;cancer-proof your body.&quot;  His immune boosters are divided into three sections:  &quot;Nutritional:  Eating for Peak Immunity&quot;; &quot;Physical: Using  the Body to Revitalize Your Immunity&quot;; and &quot;Psychological:  Don't Let Stress Trash Your Immune System.&quot;  Each section  includes general background information, as well as specific  suggestions.<br />  He discusses herbs, minerals, and vitamins in the  nutritional section, as well as presenting information about  which diets work and why.  Physical immune boosters include  how to exercise for maximum benefit (overexercise can  suppress your immunity), protecting yourself from sun  damage, and coping with allergies.  The psychological  section concentrates on overcoming stress and depression.<br />  All of Ford's tips are natural, and most are very  simple.  They are based on what Ford calls &quot;action therapy.&quot;  He says they &quot;require you to use your mind and muscles to do  what it takes to succeed in revving up your immunity.

The good news is that we have helpers  waiting to assist us in attracting abundance, radiance, and  happiness to our lives.  Webster says that &quot;we all have a  veritable army of special beings who are working all the  time to help us achieve our goals and become successful.&quot;  His book is a guide to recognizing and welcoming those  special beings into our lives.<br />  Webster traces the history of  angels and spirit guides  from antiquity forward, citing several references to angels  in the Bible.  He explains that, although angels can appear  in human form if they want to, &quot;they are not the souls of  people who have died,  unlike spirit guides, who are &quot;people  who have passed over into the next life.&quot;<br />  The book is filled with specific tips on how to contact  your invisible helpers.  He also details what you should say  and do once you've made contact.  It is possible to contact  &quot;mischievous&quot; spirits, and he recommends asking if the  spirit you've contacted is from God before listening to it.<br />  Webster emphasizes that learning to listen to and heed  the small voice inside is of primary importance.<br />  He provides guidelines for starting a &quot;psychic circle,&quot;  whereby a group of people interested in spiritual growth can  practice contacting spirit guides.<br />  Webster lectures and conducts workshops internationally  in addition to writing magazine columns and more than 35  books.

Each rereading will yield new  awareness and understanding of the nature of true prayer.<br />  Finley explains that the suffering in our lives results  from being &quot;wrongly invested in some relationship . . . &quot;;  for mistaking something &quot;as being permanent that was only  temporary.&quot;  He says the &quot;essence of this book is about  awakening within yourself to yourself . . .. &quot;<br />  His emphasis throughout the book is on turning within  for understanding and awareness of the spiritual energy that  resides in each of us.<br />  Finley says that, although most of us don't realize it,  we're all engaged in continual prayer.  He maintains that  hoping or expecting that something will, or will not,  happen, is a form of prayer.  Most of us &quot;don't know how to  request what we really need,&quot; often because we don't  understand what our true needs are.  The key, Finley says,  is to ask God to give you what He knows you need.  The basic  prayer is &quot;asking God to remove the veils from your eyes.&quot;<br />  Each chapter of The Lost Secrets of Prayer ends with  special lessons for self study.  The final chapter presents  more than 100 helpful maxims to aid in the journey to self-awakening, such as &quot;Life is not asking you questions--it is  giving you the answers!&quot;<br />  Finley is the founder of Life Learning Foundation and  author of several international best sellers on self-development.  He has guested on numerous radio and TV talk  shows.<br />  Readers won't find rote or one-size-fits-all prayers in  The Lost Secrets of Prayer.

The markings on  the back of the shell formed a magic three-by-three square.  Named the Lo Shu grid, the square was regarded as magic  &quot;because every horizontal, vertical, and diagonal row added  up to fifteen,&quot; a number of great significance in ancient  China.<br />  Chinese numerology, as well as I Ching, feng shui, and  other Chinese divination techniques, evolved from the Lo Shu  grid.<br />  Three systems of Chinese numerology are currently in  use, and Webster presents complete directions on how to use  each of them.  He starts with the Western version of Chinese  numerology, which is the easiest to learn.  He explains how  to calculate your life path number, and the significance of  each number.  For example, &quot;people with a life path number  of 6 are nurturing, caring, and responsible,&quot; while 22's  &quot;are able to achieve anything they set their minds on.&quot;<br />  He then shows how to calculate individual strengths and  weaknesses, using personal Lo Shu grids.  He presents grids  of celebrities as examples.  Edgar Cayce, Beethoven, and  Mozart all had grids indicating growth in knowledge and  wisdom through great personal losses.<br />  Webster explains that &quot;we live our lives in nine-year  cycles.  Each year contains a different energy, and if we  work with the energy, or tone, of the year we will progress  smoothly and quickly.  Conversely, if we fight the tone of  the year, we will struggle all year long.&quot;  He then presents  a simple way to determine which year you are in and gives  examples of what kinds of activities are good for each year  of the cycle.<br />  Traditional Chinese numerology uses the Lo Shu grid,  but the numbers are determined using the lunar calendar  rather than the Western solar calendar.  Not to worry--Webster includes an extensive solar-lunar conversion chart  in the appendix.<br />  The Ki, or Nine House Divination, is more complex.  It  &quot;starts with the same magic square, but the numbers change  position every year creating nine different combinations.&quot;  In addition, the numbers are associated with the basic  elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.  Each  number also has its own color.<br />  Whether you are simply interested in learning what  numerology is all about, or wish to use it for character  analysis or planning your future, you'll find Chinese  Numerology informative and helpful.but the numbers are determined using the lunar calendar   rather than the Western solar calendar.

What about all  the herbs?  How do you know which &quot;expert&quot; to trust?<br />  Madonna Sophia Compton, in Women at the Change: The  Intelligent Woman's Guide to Menopause,  provides  information to help women sort out all the conflicting  information.  She divided her book into two parts: the non-physical aspects of menopause; and the physical symptoms.<br />  Compton says that &quot;menopause is a time of new growths  and strengths, new purpose and dreams.&quot;  She encourages  women to think of &quot;menopause as the rite of passage it was  meant to be, not as some dreaded force that is seeking to  destroy us from within.&quot;<br />  In the first chapters of her book, Compton reviews the  transitions that women make from maiden to mother to crone.  She uses the birth, death, and rebirth cycle, as symbolized  by the mythical story of Demeter and Persephone, to  illustrate the transformations that all women undergo.  Menopause provides a confrontation with the self that  enables women to rediscover the depth of their souls,  according to Compton.<br />  Later chapters discuss the causes of mid-life  depression and discord.  Compton also delves into the  sources of spiritual unrest and suggests that &quot;when aging is  viewed as a spiritual journey, rather than a simple  biological process . . . the crone woman can perceive her  life as the culmination of a vast treasure house of wisdom  and knowledge.&quot;<br />  Part Two of Women at the Change details the physical  changes involved in menopause.  Compton says that &quot;each  woman must weigh the choices and make her own decision about  taking hormones during her menopause, and sometimes this  decision can be an agonizing one.&quot;  She emphasizes that the  key to making the right choice is being well-informed.  Compton dispels the myths surrounding what estrogen  will and will not do for menopausal symptoms.  For example,  while it does eliminate hot flashes, it won't restore  libido.  She includes a full description of each kind of  estrogen and the benefits and side effects of each.<br />  One chapter is devoted to the differences between  progestins (such as Provera), which are synthetic, and  natural progesterone.  Compton quotes heavily from the  studies conducted by Dr. John Lee, an established  progesterone advocate.<br />  Compton cautions that,  because natural progesterone  cannot be labeled as such, &quot;women must know exactly what  they are looking for.&quot;  She describes what to avoid, such as  some &quot;wild yam&quot; creams available, and provides the names of  some reliable preparations.<br />  Preventing bone loss and protecting the heart each has  a chapter, as does herbs and vitamins for mid-life.<br />  Unlike their mothers, women today can choose from a  variety of remedies to help see them through their  menopausal years.

Something out of  the ordinary?  Something inexpensive and relaxing?<br />  Maybe its time to collect suiseki (soo-ee-sek-ee).<br />  Felix G. Rivera, founder of the California Suiseki  Society, explains how to collect and appreciate suiseki  in his book, Suiseki: The Japanese Art of Miniature  Landscape Stones.<br />  Rivera began collecting more than twenty years ago.  Since  then he has written and lectured internationally about the  centuries-old art of suiseki collecting.<br />  New and experienced collectors alike will find his  book interesting and helpful.<br />  Although they may look like nothing more than  plain rocks to the casual observer, suiseki are very  special stones.  The forces of nature have carved them  into miniature mountains, islands, waterfalls, and  other landscapes.  Some suiseki resemble humans or  animals.  Suiseki collectors are simply people who  search for intriguing stones, which they bring home,  clean, and display.<br />  Among the benefits of collecting suiseki is time  spent enjoying the outdoors and a fascinating stone  that reminds you of the good time you had finding it.  Rivera says &quot;the true spirit of suiseki is a shared  experience,&quot; and for many,the search is as pleasurable as  finding that one perfect stone.<br />  Suiseki are never machine cleaned or polished;  collectors spend many relaxing hours lovingly hand-rubbing  their tiny landscapes.  Other than perhaps  grinding off the bottoms so that they may be displayed,  suiseki are not altered in any way by humans.<br />  Rivera writes that &quot;a suiseki may be viewed quite  simply--as a pretty stone with a nice shape--or it may  be viewed at various levels of complexity that embrace  art, philosophy, or mineralogy or that serve as a  metaphor for the connections between one's private  world and the universe.&quot;  He says that the various  levels at which one can enjoy and appreciate suiseki  make them not only art, but also enable collectors to  &quot;achieve personal satisfaction and peace.&quot;<br />  He has filled his book with tips on where to  search, what to look for, and how to clean and display  suiseki. Rivera provides general and introductory  material for new collectors, and detailed references  for the more experienced.  He includes drawings and  photographs, including 32 full-color plates with  detailed captions. The appendices include a glossary,  bibliography, and lists of where to obtain more  information, such as maps and collectors clubs.<br />  In his forward to Rivera's book, Arishige  Matsuura, Chairperson of the Japan Suiseki Association,  writes &quot;all that is required to enter the world of  suiseki is to find something intriguing about the  stone.&quot;  Rivera opens the doors to that enchanting  world with his comprehensive, but easy-to-understand  book.o enable collectors to  &quot;achieve personal satisfaction and peace.&quot;<br />  He has filled his book with tips on where to  search, what to look for, and how to clean and display  suiseki.

The authors of Small Miracles have published their  second book, appropriately enough named Small Miracles II:  Heartwarming Gifts of Extraordinary Coincidences.<br />  Halberstam and Leventhal believe that what we call  coincidences are &quot;mysterious, magical, and awe-inspiring  testimonials to God's presence in our ordinary, everyday  lives.&quot;  They have named these events &quot;small miracles.&quot;<br />  Their book is a collection of small miracles--story  after story of gifts and blessings seemingly received by  coincidence.  All are positive and reflect the essential  goodness of humankind.  Most only take a page or two, so  they can be easily read during a break from daily chores.<br />  The authors say that becoming aware of the role of  coincidences allows us to open our own hearts to the small  miracles occurring regularly in our lives.  Although enormous in its pleasure, Small Miracles II is  physically small enough to tuck into a briefcase or handbag.  Keep your copy handy--it's just what's needed to revitalize  your hope and optimism in the goodness of life.	2001-01-08

Stratton, M.S.  provides detailed descriptions of how to use meditation  for self-healing in her latest book, Seeds of Light:  Healing Meditations for Body and Soul.  The title  reflects her philosophy that &quot;healing meditations are  like seeds of light planted within your soul.&quot;  Nurturing that light will lead to self-healing.<br />  Readers can use Seeds of Light either as a  complete program or pick and choose meditations  relevant to their immediate needs.<br />  A healer, teacher, and pastoral counselor for more  than twenty years,  Stratton also wrote Touching  Spirit: A Journey of Healing and Personal  Resurrection, and founded the Touching Spirit Training  Program.<br />  Stratton believes that each of us has a healer  within ourselves.  The innate healer is a powerful  combination of physical, emotional, mental, and  spiritual energy.  Her goal is to help awaken that  inner power and stimulate mind, body, and soul healing.<br />  She organized her book into five sections:  Healing the Body; Forgiveness; Psychic Self-Defense;  Creating a New Life, and Helping Others Heal.  Each  section is  divided into chapters, including ones on  deep relaxation, pain relief, dealing with loss, and  coping with change.<br />  The exercises are simple, but most require two  people, with one person reading the steps to a second  person.  Someone working alone can either purchase  Stratton's coordinated audio tapes, or record the steps  for themselves.  Then &quot;all you have to do is pick a  meditation, sit down, and close your eyes.&quot;<br />  Different kinds of meditations meet various needs.  Stratton recommends starting with a deep relaxation  meditation as it &quot;stills the rational mind and creates  a state of deep calm.&quot;  Opening meditations help &quot;the  flow of subtle energies within&quot; the body.  Insight  meditations encourage communication.<br />  &quot;Paying close attention to whatever you are  feeling or doing in the moment&quot; is a part of  mindfulness meditation.  Clearing meditations release  &quot;unwanted emotions, thoughts, or energies.&quot;  Use  strengthening meditations to help &quot;experience yourself  as stronger, healthier, or more powerful.&quot;<br />  Affirmations accompany the meditations.  Affirmations are positive statements used to help  change negative beliefs.  Psychic self-defense  affirmations include statements such as &quot;I approve of  myself and all that I am&quot; and &quot;I have all the strength,  integrity, and courage that I will ever need.&quot;<br />  Stratton believes that &quot;healing is a lifelong  process.&quot;  She wants to help people become more aware  of their inner lives and innate healing powers.

He says that disease can be  prevented, allowing people to live longer and healthier,  by strengthening the immune system.  His book, Look  Younger, Live Longer, presents an array of natural tips  for doing just that.  The purpose of his book is to present &quot;solid and  clinical evidence of what you can and cannot do to look  younger and live longer naturally.&quot;  While his advice can  help postpone death, his intent &quot;is to show you how to  maintain optimal health for the longest possible period  of time.&quot;<br />  Dr. Goldberg doesn't offer magic elixirs or tricks  to prevent or reverse the effects of aging.  He says  &quot;your mind is the most powerful weapon in your arsenal  against premature aging&quot; and the key to youthfulness lies  &quot;in the choices we make many times each day&quot; as to what  we eat, drink, and think.  Diseases of old age are a  result of years of youthful abuse of our bodies,  according to Dr. Goldberg, and he presents statistics and  case studies to prove his assertions.<br />  His advice for living a long and healthy life  includes eating less sugar and processed foods, quitting  smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.  He writes that  &quot;your single biggest physical defense against aging is  exercise.&quot;  He also cites studies showing that pets help  their owners live longer and healthier.  He says one way  to keep your brain younger is take up a hobby.<br />  Look Younger, Live Longer is Dr. Goldberg's fifth  book, and is based on his experience with more than  11,000 patients.  Readers interested in natural ways to  improve their lives and increase their longevity will  find his advice informative and practical.	2000-12-19
