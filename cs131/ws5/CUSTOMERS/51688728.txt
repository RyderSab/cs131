I picked up a copy of the book just to compare, but was expecting to be let down because the movie was so good. I was wrong. As the old axiom goes, the book is usually better than the movie. The book is of course about John Coffey, and Paul Edgecombe, and their experiences on the Green Mile. The movie is very faithful to the book, but I loved to read the subtle differences. In some cases the lines said in the movie come form different characters in the novel, and there are additional side stories, such as the Percy-like attendant at the old-age home who has it in for Paul. Also, more background is given on the deaths of Paul's friends and family as he trudges down his own green mile, well into his 104th year. The book is divided into he original six serials, the best (and worst -depending how you look at it) is the section titled \\"The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix\\". If you thought him riding `old sparky' in the movies was hard to watch, you ain't seen nothing yet!<br /><br />Regardless if you have seen the movie or not, you must get this book and read it as soon as you can. Its a story of miracles, retribution and atonement, and is defiantly a mile worth walking.<br /><br />Relic113	2005-08-08

The legend, Druss the Deathwalker, is about as close to Conan as any other hero in literature. He is huge, powerful, and cunning, and those that cross him, and his Battle axe often end up dead. This is a prequel to the first of the Drenai books -Legend. (An amazing read also!) Druss is on a quest to find some magical jewels that are a dying friend's only chance of survival. Unfortunately, the insane God-King has decided to desecrate an ancient burial tomb where the jewels are allegedly hidden. Druss, does what he does best - leads the grossly outnumbered defenders against the invading hoard. Several side adventured such as Druss having to cross the boundaries of life, to combat demons and monsters, a wicked shaman, and a promising young general fill this novel to the brim with high-adventure. And the ending actually made me drop the book while reading it. I cant believe the last fifteen pages how Gemmell gives a Hitchcock like twist and countless mysteries of the Drenai series are answered. It is few and far between that I cant see the ending coming. (Enders Game got me too!) And this ending blew my mind.<br /><br />Buy the Drenai tales, and read them all, just so you can read this book and appreciate the magic that is Druss the Legend, and the Brilliance that is David Gemmell.<br /><br />Relic113	2005-08-08

And first off let me say that i am fiscally a little to the the right and socially a bit on the left, so I don't know what that makes me. Also, I am Canadian, so am pretty impartial as to the politics of the U.S.A. and also to most of the people in this book.<br /><br />Ok, first off, let me say I think it is pretty bad form to say that Jimmy Carter is screwing up America. The man was President and should be given the respect that goes with that position. And yes the same goes for G.W. Bush, so I am not playing favorites. You may not like the leaders of both past and present, and we have the right (and duty) to question and critique them (that is what freedom is for) however, I'm sure we can find faults in all former world leaders - so it is a bit of a cheap shot that Carter is singled out. Why not JFK? He was a womanizer and was not perfect in the \\"moral compass\\" department either. (This book refers to the \\"moral compass\\" of people a lot!) And Reagan liked making nuclear bombs...and Clinton...well, where do we start? So you see all people can make mistakes - it doesn't mean they are ruining the country.  Eminem is blasted because of his music. If this book was written 35 years ago - would Bernard have blasted Elvis for gyrating? Or the Beatles for having long hair? Paris Hilton's family is listed because she is a fan of the spotlight, and is rich and lets us know about it with her behavior. How is that different from countless other rich and famous people?(including people who write books, and go on the late night talk show circuit promoting it?) I'm sure if many of us had the money Paris does we would have been different as well. I can guarantee I wouldnt have washed dished for $4.00 an hour!<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that some of the people in this book aren't part of the problem. They are. However, Saying Michael Moore is the #1 person messing up America is a bit much... Surely Osama Bin Laden, or David Duke, or even Jerry Springer (and his guests!) have caused more serous hate and fear and injury to America than Michael Moore?<br />What would have been nice is if this book had more of a critical analysis regarding the policy makers, criminal overlords, and environmental destroyers instead of celebrities. Perhaps a better title would have been: \\"100 people I don't agree with.\\" - But that likely would not have sold as many copies.<br /><br />Finally, getting back to the \\"moral compass\\", Was it really necessary to specifically point out that Al Franken was number 37? It seems a tad childish to do such a thing. Goldberg could have at least mentioned himself on the list as well; having the insight to see that these sort of attacks on others is a causal part of the rift among society today. It also would have made him come across as more objective and not the person who made a fool of himself on the Daily Show by being overly partisan and disrespectful.<br /><br />All-in-all, it is an entertaining book, however, i wish it had a little more substance and was aimed at the true causes of societies problems, and not at Paris Hilton, her dog, and her parents.<br /><br />Regardless if you are on the right or the left, remember that there is no list of 100 people that are screwing up society. Our problems are complex and run far deeper than this list.<br /><br />Relic113d his guests!) have caused more serous hate and fear and injury to America than Michael Moore?

Usually i read \\"Grown up\\" fantasy books like Jordan, Goodkind and GRR Martin - but Harry Potter has certainly been an appreciated diversion. Its been so long sine I was a child and believed in magic but J.K. Rowlings brings me back to that more innocent time. I am not going to review the plot - there are over 1500 reviews for that - I just wanted to Thank Mrs. Rowling's for doing something that should have been done a long time ago. It may sound kind of strange - but i almost feel like i have attended Hogwarts. As i read these books i was in a new city away from my friends and going to law school. I know its not quite the same... but anyone who has ever studied law knows that there is a lot of strange words [usually Latin] and scary professors galore. I swear my administrative law professor is the spitting image of professor Umbridge, and my contracts prof. is Snape re-incarnated... Maybe its just how great of storyteller Rowlings is that makes me believe...Thankfully, soon I will be done law school, but sadly, someday, this series will come to an end.<br /><br />I highly suggest reading it - the first book is almost a children's book, but they grow darker as time goes on. [not unlike real life]Anyone who reads fantasy and does not read these books is a disgrace to the genre.

No, this monster is worse than all of them -it's the Federal government!<br /><br />Nothing can destroy more lives, ruin the planet, or make waiting on hold utterly gut wrenching the way the Government can. Thankfully we have Timothy Burnham, a presidential speech writer to keep us all safe from this behemoth. This book has it all - a bungling president, Russian spies, traitors, and the excitement of bureaucracy in action. This tale tells us how Tim rises from lowly speechwriter to the confidant of the president just in time to save us all.<br /><br />Benchley's prose and comedic timing is on top of his game here, and this book is a definite read of political satirists and monster lovers alike!<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Benchley!	2005-06-24

Fortunately, he is also about twice the size of the other panthers, and they defer to his growl when he needs feeding. Ku-ma knowing how strong he is, sometimes gets into trouble - not realizing that the other animals in the jungle may not be as big, but they have other weapons. As such, this book has several humorous accounts of Ku-ma trying to feed himself with varying degrees of success.<br />After his skills are honed however, it is Ku-Ma, and not the lion, that is the true king of the jungle. Of course, being on top always has a price. In this case, the hunters have heard of this mythical white panther and they are looking for him. Mighty Ku-Ma kills one man, and then the real hunt begins.<br /><br />Read this book if you can find it. The prose is written for the young reader, but the ideas and the imagery of the text are the kinds that can make a person weep.<br /><br />Thank You Mr. Waldeck<br /><br />Relic113	2005-06-24

Imagine not being able to be killed by nature or man. Any wounds, weathering or ravaging from age would instead be reflected in a picture of you in the attic...What would you do? Would you help people or would you become warped by your own perversions and desires? The picture captures these nuances as well. Every heart you break and every insult you make transforms the picture. What happens when you look upon the portrait? Will you be oblivious or delve into madness at the horror of who you are? This is the tale of Dorian Grey and is one that anyone who is even mildly introspective must read and consider deeply. Buy it new in the bookstore or find an old battered copy in the used shop -it's a masterpiece no matter how horrible or wonderful it may look on the outside...too bad the same cannot be said for the us...<br /><br />Relic113	2005-02-13

This was the first Grisham book I ever read - amazing since I am in Law School and many of my classmates never shut up about him. I read this with the goal of summarizing it for a Prof. But surprisingly found myself enjoying it despite numerous legal flaws. Its the story of a poor criminal lawyer who is defending a man who killed another for no apparent reason. Enter the mysterious stranger who lets our hero in on a little secret - that a drug caused this reaction and there is a need to settle quickly and quietly... As a reward our \\"hero\\" is given a large civil class action claim against a rival drug company and the $100 million in contingency fees givers birth to the appellation The King of Torts... Then things don't go as plan for our new monarch. I read this in a few short hours and would say that it was on par with a typical movie. Nothing too brilliant but a good way to pass the time.

I had read good things about it and bookreaders I respect had recommended it to me. Unfortunately this book is plagued with \\"made up word syndrome\\" where about a third of the nouns are words that have no etymology in this universe. This is further compounded by the use of ridiculous names such as the hero \\"Phedre no Delaunay\\". Yes this is the heroine's name -very annoying to be sure.<br />Now that my personal gripe has been dealt with I should say that the outlined premise of the book is unique... a concubine uses her special \\"ability\\" to withstand pain and other deviant acts inflicted on her from her \\"johns¨ during sexual encounters. She has \\"Kushiels Dart¨ - a fleck in her eye that is symbolic of this unique trait allowing her to turn pain into pleasure. She uses this method to get close to politicians to gather secrets and the game begins. Unfortunately this tuned into one of those 800+ page books that you just keep reading because at some point it must get good -It didn't. I don't use this phrase very often -but this was clearly a \\"chick book\\". And no, that has nothing to do with the fact the lead character is female. (Steal the Dragon and Game of Thrones both have female leads and they are outstanding) No, I call this a \\"chick book¨ because it seemed to read as a soft-core porn/romance novel. I enjoy reading about sex as much as the next guy, but there is no need for an eight page sex scene in a fantasy novel. Make it two pages and get on with the espionage. The weak writing and the made up words and dreadful sex scenes made this book a chore to finish. I am not impressed that there is a sequel for this and I (unlike Phedre) take no pleasure in needless pain, and will not be reading the next book.<br /><br />As For Mr.B.J Wilson: (A reviewer of all of 3 whole books - all by himself too!)<br /><br />This book was terrible - run from it as if it were the Plague!!<br /><br />This book is in fact a microcosm of etiology - I stand by my original assessment-but do thank you for the correction.

Allen also finds half a map to some treasure buried by the long dead boy. Despite its short length there are some interesting plot twists and a rather mysterious raven and a suspicious old man next door... After reading this book I checked the net to find more about the author. Apparently this book was banned in some schools because of the occultism themes and ideas of ghosts and magic. Likely by the same people that think Harry Potter is a threat to our children's safety. After finding out that some crazed religious person wanted to burn this book makes me all the more pleased that I had the opportunity to re-read this joy.  Read this book if you can find a copy. Read it for the Twilight zone like ending. Read it for your child who wants a scare. Read it to upset those who would ban books on us and make it a darker world for all of us. Or just read it because treasure should not be kept in the bottom of a drawer or even at the bottom of an empty grave.	2005-01-09

Richards is poor and has a 3 year old child - sick with respiratory ailments - just like all the poor folk who cant afford clean air filters. He is chosen to be on the running man - the Mack-Daddy of all prime time shows. The runner gets 100 dollars an hour and wins a billion if he can run for the full 30 days without getting caught. All he has to do is send in a tape to the studio once a day to show he is still alive. Easy right? Then how come the record is only eight days? Because the entire county is looking for you and will get rewards for sightings or even killing you! There is also a team of professional hunters that will stop at nothing from killing their prey. Friends and relatives will be bribed or tortured as the case may be for information. This book moves at breakneck speed and the pressure does not stop until the incredible ending. The only advantage Richards has is a twelve-hour head start and the fact there are no rules. If you thought Ken Jennings was a tough contestant on Jeopardy you haven't seen Ben Richards.

One boy wins the prize, the rest pay the price. This is more of a psychological terror book than anything else. We are in the mind of sixteen year old Ray Garraty as he walks down the road. We learn the why people would walk, and what keeps them going, and what happens when death is less painful than the next step. As I read this book I could not help but wonder how long I could last. As Ray learns it is not about the fittest or the strongest or even who has the best shoes. To be champion of the long walk takes something more.

While on the run the murderer meets a woman who is searching for a child faith healer.

It was surprisingly easy to do so. The snippets of wisdom can easily apply to other situations - much the same as how a horoscope can apply to any and all Capricorn's or Leo's.

First off - I love the Dark Tower series as a whole (the first 4 were awesome) but I have some problems with the final books as they seemed rushed - likely they were due to the Macular degeneration, and Mr. King's health in general.<br /><br />There will be spoilers in this review - so read at your own risk.  I hated how the type of language changed over the series. The first book had a few \\"old world\\" expressions but by the end there was little English remaining. It was all thankee and Ka and sai - almost to the point of incomprehension. I did not like how Flagg went out like a punk. He was supposed to be the epitome of evil - I mean he survived a nuclear blast in the stand and here he dies from a spider bite? The Crimson king will go down as the all time lamest villain death in literature. I mean, a new character can \\"draw\\" him away? Instead of Patrick the character should have been called Simon with his magic crayon. This was the most contrived plots I have ever read. King should have known better. In the book \\"Misery\\" Annie complains to Paul about the same thing. She calls it \\"Cheating\\" referring to the way the old cliffhangers show the car go off the cliff with the hero in it...and the next week the hero gets out just before the car leaves the cliff. This is another forms of \\"Cheating\\" as a writer cant just create a character to use a magic crayon to draw a way out of a tough situation. I would have given 4 out of 5 but for this point.<br /><br />Another concern I had with the last 3 in series was their length. Sure they are 800 pages of Print but these are in a huge font, with wide margins and lots of white space. (A trick common in James Pattersons Alex Cross Novels) In reality these books are likely 200-400 pages, thus are far shorter that books 2,3, and 4... I hate this publishing trick and whenever I see it I know I have a real stinker.<br /><br />I did not like the events that occurred in the Tower - they were somehow \\"Wrong.\\" A little too quick and a little too flat. I really really enjoyed the actual ending...particularly the final line as that is a clever way to end the book.. (The exact same ending as David Gemmel's \\"Morningstar\\" which I doubt King has read so it's a coincidence I'm sure) BUT I would have made one small change. I would have had the Tower tell the gunslinger that he was too slow (resulting in too many broken beams) and should not have stopped at so many places or that he had made too many errors (Eddie, Jake deaths) or that the parallel Stephen King was to live... etc Anything...and because of the errors Roland makes the Tower makes him do it all over again and will continue to do so until he gets it right. It's the same ending just with more sorrow knowing that Roland will be following the man in black forever.<br /><br />I didn't mind waiting. It's been 25 years from the first step to the next first step for Roland. I would have rather the journey was more enjoyable than expedient. If king wanted to retire that is fine. God knows no one deserves it more than him. But Cheating the fans with big fonts, contrived plots and the additions of a new character that solves all the problems is not the way to end the journey. In my mind I pretend that the story ends after Wizard and Glass with Roland forever chasing the tower to no avail. Ironically this is no different than the actual ending - but my way is more honest.nd a little too flat. I really really enjoyed the actual ending...particularly the final line as that is a clever way to end the book.. (The exact same ending as David Gemmel's \\"Morningstar\\" which I doubt King has read so it's a coincidence I'm sure) BUT I would have made one small change. I would have had the Tower tell the gunslinger that he was too slow (resulting in too many broken beams) and should not have stopped at so many places or that he had made too many errors (Eddie, Jake deaths) or that the parallel Stephen King was to live... etc Anything...and because of the errors Roland makes the Tower makes him do it all over again and will continue to do so until he gets it right. It's the same ending just with more sorrow knowing that Roland will be following the man in black forever.  <br /> <br />I didn't mind waiting. It's been 25 years from the first step to the next first step for Roland. I would have rather the journey was more enjoyable than expedient. If king wanted to retire that is fine. God knows no one deserves it more than him. But Cheating the fans with big fonts, contrived plots and the additions of a new character that solves all the problems is not the way to end the journey. In my mind I pretend that the story ends after Wizard and Glass with Roland forever chasing the tower to no avail. Ironically this is no different than the actual ending - but my way is more honest.	2004-12-29

Snow is an altered conceptualization of the Snow White myth. Jessica, a young girl has a stepmother move in - and the woman brings a large mirror that she likes to gaze into. Oh, did I mention she was a wicked stepmother. (Is there any other kind?) It doesn't take long for the trouble to begin and true to the story a huntsman is called to dispatch the girl. A slight variation on the dwarves is that they are not miners per se. They are all disfigured \\"monsters\\" - one is a cat-woman, another a rat-man and so forth... and they are pickpockets and thieves who \\"mine\\" the pockets of the unsuspecting in the town. They are really a great bunch and I wish there would be a sequel with them. This book is short but there is a great deal of fun in its pages. I plan on buying other books in this new genre of adapted fairly tales.<br />Buy this book - it doesn't matter your age - after all, who doesn't love a good bed time story?<br /><br />Relic113	2004-12-24

This book started off great - basically its about \\"lawyers\\" who use swords to decide who wins the case. True, its not the most original idea in the world, but the execution was very good. Our hero Loredan opens up a little shop to train young fencers-at-law, after narrowly avoiding his own death in a case he was lucky to win. Here is where the book loses its path for me. The pace slows right down and the book tries to turn itself into a political espionage type novel. I read and read waiting for something to happen but not much ever did. The characters were enjoyable, but the action wasn't. I'm sure this first book in a series of three is a good set up for a political espionage novel,[except for A game of Thrones of course]  but that's not really my cup of tea and should not be listed in the fantasy section. So I cant really make a fair review as I became jaded by the deception as to the type of book I was reading - however, I think that it was well written and anyone who can read fantasy without the need for dragons, magic, princesses, and monsters might like this series.	2004-12-24

Instead we get a very long and very boring tale about a guard and his romances. I wont give this book one star as I did not finish it. (A rare thing for me to do to be sure) so its possible there was some clever ending. More likely it was as poorly written as the rest of the book - or at least as dull as the first 400 pages.

Seyonne uses his unique magic to protect his master. The result is two-fold. He beings to become friends with his master, and the demons become concerned that they cannot control the king. then the real battle begins.

Another great book by the author of \\"Jaws\\", \\"Beast\\" and the incredibly beautiful \\"Girl From the Sea of Cortez\\". This is not about sea monsters, but rather the monster that is alcoholism. Scott Preston doesn't have a problem. Its everyone else that does. It must be a metabolic thing why he is the only one sweating on the bus...It must be the waitresses problem that she is watching to see if he is going to spill his drink... and after the intervention he will agree to get treatment just to shut his family up...and then he will go have a few more... As sad as people can be when they have a drinking problem, Benchley does a great job of making Preston very likeable and unbelievably witty and clever. The reader almost wants him to be able to go have a drink. This book is very lighthearted despite its dark subject matter. Once in rehab, Preston meets a cast of characters that rivals the core group from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest... And that's when the murder takes place. From there the book increases in suspense and pace. It's amazing how much entertainment Benchley can squeeze into 250 pages - moreover, its amazing that this man is known for monster books and not his precision wit and biting social commentary.<br />Buy this book - its 12 steps worth taking.<br /><br />Relic113	2004-12-24

(Yes this includes the Uk first edition Game of Thrones and all the ARC versions) Also, i own all the numbered Limited editions (Songs the Dead men sing, Armageddon Rag, RRetrospective etc)... the collection cost a fortune! That being said i have tried time and time again to enjoy this book. The imagery and symbolism are everywhere but at the end of the day i just cant care about these people. There are a few too many \\"made up\\" words and the science fiction aspect is lacking - just because events transpire on Worlorn and not Earth is not enough to make it science fiction. This is romance. Anyhow, I know this is a sad tale that is the predecessor of all of Martins other sad tales...

At first I was skeptical how a 6 year old could be this great military genius to combat the invading alien forces. (I still wish he was 10 years old) but Card does a good job of showing Enders emotional weaknesses. I love how he keeps succeeding against all odds in the training academy and they keep raising the bar making each task more and more difficult until the very end when they put him in a no win situation.

I loved the plot -A group of wannabee magicians finds someone who can actually cast spells - despite their beliefs that magic is long dead. Consequently, they can no longer even research magic as stipulated in the wager. After that the book meanders aimlessly for 500 pages...I didn't love this aspect quite as much...There is no reason that this book needed to be 750+ pages for the rather anti-climactic (but satisfying) ending. One wonders if she is taking a page from the Robert Jordan School of bad writing. (Which is good writing - just too many needless descriptions) Anyhow, I did find the footnotes quite a good concept. It was fun to read little blurbs about the etiology of a phrase or the background of a location. I guarantee this idea will appear in future fantasy works.<br />A lot of people liked this book but I was fairly indifferent. When I read gargantuan tomes I expect them to be as good as G.R.R.

I own about 40 chess books, but this is the first I have ever felt the need to review. This is the definitive chess book as the ideas Nimzovich brought to the game were unheard of before his mastery. Ideas like center control and prophylaxis were scoffed at, no one understood the power of a rook on the 7th or the pawn chain until his explanations. Sadly, the only flaw in this version is that the diagrams are small and grainy. (This does not detract form the expertly written text) Nimzovich was the \\"Stormy Petrel\\" for a reason. He was pretty high on himself, but generally had good reason to be. My Elo went up about 50 points during the duration of the read and another 30 on re-read.

The long and short of it is the protagonist is a 2 bit criminal who like most 2 bit hoods try for the one big score which is where the fun begins...Lots of plot twists and turns... Eddie started out as a car thief but then turned into the driver. And this is where my only problem with the book is. I would have easily give five stars but for the incessant repetition of the expression \\"I'm the driver...\\" that Eddie uses at every possible chance. I swear this phrase must have appeared 50 times in a 200-page book. He would refuse to be the gunman saying, \\"I'm the driver\\"... When the other bad guys tried to get him involved in planning he refuses and says \\"I'm the driver\\"... and even when he meets a woman his pick up line is \\"I'm the driver\\".... I guess that works for felon groupies. He even tries to rent movies that are about driving.  Anyhow this really got on my nerves by page 50 and by the end of the book those 3 words \\"drove\\" me crazy. However, the Hitchcock-like ending does compensate for this gross repetition. I would strongly suggest taking this book for a \\"drive\\" if you want an awesome pulp story - but be prepared for it to \\"stall\\" a bit when it comes to dialogue.	2004-12-24

Where wolves of the calla and wizard and glass had adventures that were told from begining to end this book does not.

I guess we have to wait for book 7 to find out.<br /><br />The one redeeming feature in my opinion is that King writes himself into this book. Roland and Eddie have to deal with Stephen King who thinks he is going nuts since his own creations are now in his kitchen talking to him...But it isnt Quite King...its like a parallel universe king as there are some subtle differences and a major one at the end that really makes for a cliffhanger ending...very comparable to the wastelands ending for the suspense it provides...<br /><br />Thankfully we only have to wait a few weeks for the final... i pray that its better than this book...

Every chapter ends with a teaser or a good, old-fashioned cliffhanger that makes you want to read on. John Darnton has written an imaginative and entertaining high adventure story along the lines of Richard Leakey meets Indiana Jones. Purists beware-it's not \\"Origin of Species.\\" or even \\"Jurassic Park\\" Neanderthal has just enough science to make it feel right and just enough creative flourishes to make it feel like fun. Darnton begins intermixing anthropological fact and fiction on the first page and his book quickly evolves into a pounding ride that doesn't let up until the final page.  For me i love the idea of ancient tribes and the fact that the tribe doesnt care for [us]lowly cro-magnon types make it all the more enjoyable...<br /><br />Buy this book if you like the idea of another species usurping the polluting earth-killers we have all evolved into...	2004-09-12

I bought this book on the strength of the number of five start ratings and the praises from worthy names in the SF/Fantasy field. Man, it was a difficult read... this isnt a book for children. (not to mention the main character is in fact a torturer and there is some rather violent descriptions and allusions...<br /><br />The style is for seasoned readers only... That being said, this book is well written, but, for all the literary allusions and subtleties of plot, I sometimes found it difficult sustain interest in Severian. [or maybe i was just confused] Characters, though well drawn, just seem to pop up in the most bizarre situations and then leave, whilst the stoic Severian continues on his almost aimless wanderings. The book often heads off on philosophical tangents, or spends inordinate time on the most trivial detail. I do not know how this can be compared to Tolkien's Ring trilogy, or the Song of Ice and Fire,but it is worth the read... I found these first two books very heavy going, but rewarding so I will  to finish the saga in the hope that Severian redeems himself.	2004-09-12

You cant keep the title forever...just ask Ali or Tyson... and so it is with Tolkien. GRR Martin is the new king of the fantasy world with the Song of Ice and Fire. (And his short stories are wonderful too)<br /><br />George R. R. Martin's superb fantasy epic continues in consummate style as bloodshed and alchemy lay waste the Seven Kingdoms in this second volume of A Song of Ice and Fire. The Iron Throne once united the Sunset Lands, but King Robert is dead, his widow is a traitor to his memory, and his surviving brothers are set on a path of war amongst themselves. At King's Landing, the head of Lord Eddard Stark rots on a spike for all to see. His daughter Sansa is betrothed still to his killer's son Joffrey -- Queen Cersei's son, though not the son of her late husband Robert. Even so, Joffrey is now a boy-king, Cersei is his regent, and war is inevitable. In Dragonstone, Robert's brother Stannis has declared himself king, while his other brother Renly proclaims himself king at Storm's End -- and Eddard Stark's fifteen year old son Robb wears the crown of the north at Winterfell. A comet in the night sky, red and malevolent, the colour of blood and flame, can only be an omen of murder and war. Stannis's child Princess Shireen dreams of dragons waking from stone. And a white raven has brought word from the Citadel itself, foretelling summer's end. It has been the longest summer in living memory ...<br /><br />GRRM kills of major characters as if they were extras...Its just awesome! He once said that he wants a cast of 1000... but i question if that will be enough given the title of the fortcoming fourth book and the trends in A Storm of Swords...<br /><br />Read this again as you await the \\"Feast for Crows\\"...<br /><br />Thank you George.	2004-09-12

US	51688728	R1CFOTYCP1AA83	0061091995	952069519	Sacrament	Books	4	21	21	N	N	A Great Read...	Sacrament is the least read of Clive Barker's novels. It apparently only sold half the usual number of his books, and there is one simple reason for this: the protagonist is gay. In this day and age it is a real shame that readers have been put off by such an unimportant detail...<br /><br />The story concerns Will Rabjohns, a wildlife photographer who is attacked by a grizzly bear and left in a coma. During months of unconsciousness he goes dreaming of his childhood in Yorkshire, where he met two enigmatic characters, Jacob Steep and Rosa McGee, who have lived for centuries in ignorance of what they are or how they came about, and have strange ideas about what the world is and their role in it. Will re-discovers how Steep shaped his life, and on waking from his coma is drawn back into contact with him again, as Steep goes about his murderous crusade. Steep, you see, has a perverse desire to make certain species of animals extint and hunts them with a satanic glee...<br /><br />This, of course, is just the barest bones of the story. As ever with Barker's books there is a world of content on these bones: his sharply realised characters, his natural sense of pace, his prose approaches perfection here, his ability to tell his story with original, unpredictable scenes, and the nuggets of philosophy that his work always contains. It is in this last capacity that Barker has excelled himself with this novel. The nature of God, existence, life and death are examined with an intelligent, well-considered insight that I have never encountered before in any media anywhere else, including Barker's own. If that makes the book sound like a tough read, it isn't at all. Barker has an instinct for description that makes reading his stuff effortless; you don't so much read it as see it, and you glide through the pages so quickly.<br /><br />For anyone whose mind is sharper than the average turnip, and can't help but wonder occasionally about whether or not there's a God and what life is for etc this is a book for you. It doesn't pretend to supply answers, of course, but throws up so many possibilities, and so many words of wisdom, that you absolutely come away with the parameters of your own mind stretched. I can safely say that you've never read a book like this before. There's nobody out there that mingles reality and fantasy like Barker, and gives a sense of there being more to the world than meets the eye.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book with real weight, real imagination and intelligence, get your paws on this before you yourself become extint...is a book for you.

(and yes sometimes he even likes to play God and render moral judgments) - but hey we have to forgive him for that...we all need a little fun from time to time...<br /><br />This book is a series of short stories that were written by GRRM over about a 10 year span, yet they seamlessly flow together... We learn the origins of the seedship in the first story \\"The Plague Star\\" which is quite possibly the best of the bunch (receiving 11/10) while the others only get 10/10... Tuf has to save a world from overpopulation (twice), save another world from sea monsters like no one can imagine, solve a worlds cruel practice of gambling on a wicked sporting event, and protect a world from a biblical prophet who has a unique ability to create plagues...Fortunately he has the help of his massive starship, his massive brain and a few cats...<br /><br />An amazing read...When I look up at the stars now I wonder when Tuf will come and solve the problems of this world...for he is long overdue...<br /><br />While we wait - I suggest you read this masterpiece to be reminded that one person can make a difference...<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Martin - and since Tuf never gets the recognition he deserves - Thank you Mr. Haviland.	2004-09-12

Many people have said that they can't imagine<br /><br />  many kids today enjoying this book as it's a bit too wordy and long, but considering how many read the Harry Potter books i suspect kinds will handle this one too...<br /><br />  Those books aren't much different to this one in the way they are wordy and long.<br /><br />  This is a wonderful tale of good vs evil that needs to be read more than once.

That being said, once i got into the book as it is i was really hooked. The outline is Still Cheif Brody, Hooper, and Quint doing their thing to stop the large shark from doing hers...It was just like realing a story about a shark in a parallel universe with the characters i loved from the movie...

Considering how similar the outline of the plots between Jaws and Beast are, Benchely does an amazing job of actually making this book a better page turner...Beast, like Jaws, is about a large seamonster - a giant squid this time - that kills a few people, and then the community slowly beings to figure out what it is and then make efforts to kill it... The beauty of this story are the substories. Benchley starts several new chapters, with new characters in the middle of the book. All of these non-main characters are doing something out at sea... Some of them return home while some do not. Its amazing how fast Benchley makes one care about these characters and how upset the reader is when they dont make it...<br /><br />All the while the descriptions of the monster are neutral...there is no rage or evil in the beast, it simply exists and needs food... too bad the area has been overfished and now the beast must hunt...<br /><br />The final confrontation is a brilliantly written conclusion and one that will leave you wanting more... as amazing as it is, i enjoyed this much more than jaws...and i really loved jaws...<br /><br />Speilberg should consider  doing to this book what he did with Jaws...

Gemmell is a great writer, but he does one thing particularly well...he makes you actually care about the characters. This is the story of the legend of \\"Morningstar\\" told by an old bard/wizard to his imaginary friend over dinner one day. The story is to important to allow a real person to hear, so the protagonist passes the time with ghosts.<br /><br />The Morningstar is in reality nothing more than a common bandit who through a set of circumstances is thrust into greatness...but unlike other books with this theme, the morningstar continues to be a rogue...That is until the war breaks out and an evil necromancer tries to resurect the vampire kings... then someone must act...Despite being dislikable, the morningstar attracts quite a follwing and he can be described as a robin hood/conan compilation...<br /><br />A really enjoyable book with a great ending that doesnt leave room for a sequel, but at the same time we know that the morningstar will be back... anyone who reads this book (which i suggest you do) will understand what im talking about...	2004-08-22

I cant tell you how many books involve a person being chased by &quot;the bad guys&quot; and the heroine just runs into mini adverture after mini adventure, solving all easily with no real chance of death. This book is about an apprentice poison worker that meets a master of poison/assasin and spend much of the book running. There are flashbacks to 15th century earth to help explain how and why these people ended up on this distant planet enslaved by aliens. This is a very interesting sub plot, but not one that is needed. I mean do we really need to know why people are on a plantet? Usually its enough for the author to jsut tell us they are there and for the reader to accept it...Anyhow bring this one along if you have a long car trip...otherwise dont bother...	2004-07-06

After watching Pirates of the Carribean i pulled this one off my shelf where it had been collecting dust for a decade...(I bought it after reading Jaws) The Idea of this book is pretty interesting: a man arrives at an island where the people have not &quot;evolved&quot; and are basically still living the life of pirates and do not conform to modern values...There is a hidden treasure of course... but not one we might expect... The problem with this otherwise fine boook is that too much time is speant on the relationship between the protagonist and his son and the troubles in their relationship and not enough time dealing witht he pirates and the seamonsters...<br />Imagine &quot;Jaws&quot; with Chief Brody's son on board bickering instead of &quot;sharking&quot; and you will get my point...<br />All in all not a bad read, but &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;The Beast&quot; are much more satisfying...	2004-05-02

There are no frilly vampires in this book that whine and complain as in Mrs. Rice's books. Instead we have a little bit of horror, a dash of history, and quite possibly the most memorable ending line that I have ever read.<br />There is a quote from &quot;If You Could Read my Mind&quot; (a song by Gordon Lightfoot) that aptly applies to this book.<br />It goes: &quot;...You won't read that book again because the ending is just to hard to take...&quot;<br />...and it truly was. I seldom cry at the conclusion of a story, but no matter how many times I read this masterpiece, the tears continue to swell...<br /><br />Read this book.

While trying to capture the personification of Death (a tried and true fantasy convention) a magician captures instead the King of<br />Dreams, who remains his prisoner for seven decades until he (Dream) is finally given an opportunity to escape. Comic book conventions come into play at the beginning with guest appearances by John Constantine and Etrigan as Dream pursues his lost tools of office. But when Dream finally confronts the man,(a minor DC villain,Dr. Destiny)who possesses the last of these tools the series enters a different realm far from the typical comic book. Taking his lead from Alan Moore's work on Swamp Thing, Gaiman creates an atmosphere of real horror as Dr. Destiny warps the lives of a few unlucky diner patrons, driving them to madness before he is finally stopped by Dream. It is in the scenes at the diner Gamain's talent really comes to the forefront and you realize that this is no typical comic book experience. By showing the gradual destruction of these characters Gaiman give the reader a peak at what becomes the theme of the entire series; the power of dreams in our lives.<br /><br />Relic113	2003-01-18

Just ask Ali or Tyson. It may be sad, but its true, G. R. R. Martin has replaced Tolkien as the ruler of the fantasy world. The First two books in This series were the best books i had read in years, and this one was even better than them! It is really rare for a series to get better in latter volumes (ask Jordan or Goodkind) but George shows us that it can be done. This book is also 922 pages! it doesnt cut any corners like some other series where they release a 450 page book when all their previous books in the series were 700+ pages (and charge the same price of course)<br /><br /> This book carried on where the last one left off, We spend lots of time in the north and begin to see why there is a Gargantuan wall there in the first place!... and of course the usual (for these books) slaughtering of MAJOR characters... G. R. R. Martin offers no more protection to major players than he does to a peon in some field. Anyone can die (and does) which is a nice change from Goodkind (Richard will never die) or Jordan (where its likely only Rand will die) And the major ones that ones that do \\"live\\" can find themselves short a hand, or have their throat slit, or framed for murder of a king.... Oh, Ya, one of the many kings gets \\"offed\\" in this book too..<br /><br />Its no wonder G. R. R. Martin wants a cast of 1000 characters over his 6 books, considering the rate he kills them. I just wonder if 1000 will be enough? The next book is called \\"A Feast for Crows\\" which implies a lot more dead bodies...I cant Wait!<br /><br />Buy This Book, Buy 2 copies actually since you will wear one out from reading it.<br /><br />This series ROCKS and IS the BEST fantasy series ever bar none.<br /><br />Thank You Mr. Martin<br /><br />Relic113	2002-11-30

The title story is the best of the 6 and is worth the price alone. The other stories i found to be very good were \\"Star Lady\\" and \\"Bitterblooms\\". Sandkings is really a moral based story on what power can do to people. Martin Uses the metaphor of a man who is a deity to some insects.... but trust me they are MUCH MUCH more than just insects...<br /><br />Bitterblooms was a cool little story with Vampires, a Girl Trying to get through the dark woods, and a mysterious house in the middle of nowhere....<br /><br />Star Lady is basically the story of a girl and an alien boy with golden skin who land on a planet and are made slaves by a pimp. its got a really cool ending...<br /><br />Buy this book if you can find it in a used book store.<br /><br />Relic113	2002-11-30

Its about some girl Jensson (Richards long lost sister of course)and is 700 pages about HER. I would not have minded if they hadnt charged the same price as the other sword of truth books. This book is a waste of time, skip it and buy the next one and just pretend that Jensson was always around and you will be fine.... I am so mad at Terry Goodkind. He gets one more chance, if \\"The Naked Empire\\" is not as good as Wizards First Rule or Faith if the Fallen, I will NEVER buy anything from him again!<br /><br />Skip this one, go read some G.R.R. Martin, he knows how to continue a series!!<br /><br />Relic113	2002-11-30

The wild card series is awesome...the alien virus continues to spread adventure and despair thoughout our world.<br />...all i have to say is that Croyd Crenson is the coolest tough guy on the planet. He totally rampages in this book, Demise, The Gangs, other Aces, and even the general public arent safe from Croyd. The only person who he helps is himself (and snotman by accident) he is a bad dude and makes this book the best of the bunch!!<br /><br />In fact the first 8 books in this series rock, and so does number 11, (and anything in between with Croyd Crenson aka \\"The Sleeper\\") but the other ones kind of drag on....as a rule avoid The one written by Snodgrass like the Plauge...no scrap that...avoid it like the Wild Card Virus...<br /><br />Buy this book, The Sleeper rules (when he's awake)<br /><br />Relic113	2002-11-21

I think the reavers and the dedicates make for an interesting take on the world of fantasy, and Raj Ahten is a cool bad guy despite his fall from grace in this book... im sure he will be back in the future, as i hope Mr. Farland is soon with the 4th book in this series...<br /><br />Buy this Book!<br /><br />Relic113	2002-11-21

If Terry goodkind did not write a sequal this book would have been 5 stars as a stand alone novel.

I tried to, I really did, but I just couldn't. It was well written, and had a good flow to it, but I just couldnt accept the plot.(Spoilers ahead- don't read this review if you haven't read the text yet!)<br /><br />I just can't accept the girl hidden in boys clothes until s/he is 13 storyline...even if it's by magic... This device is used in way too many stories. So as soon as I read this plot line I was disinterested...maybe it was just me...This is a big pet peeve of mine... (I know - people are screaming - she looks like a boy because of Magic) - Well, i also cant stand books where Magic is the answer to everything!<br /><br />(Frankly I bought it cause George .R.R. Martin strongly endorsed it on the cover)<br /><br />Skip this one unless you are a huge fan of the \\"hidden princess\\" dressed as a little boy plot device...... Otherwise, go read the princess bride again - it's a much nicer tale.	2002-11-13

Martin is the greatest author ever, and he knows it. Not many authors could put out a book with an incomplete story, a screenplay, and 2 materials that have already been published (one being just an exerpt from Song of ice and fire). But this book works here becasue of the intoductions and explanations to the stories...too often we forget that there is a real person writing our stories and that they have problems and concerns in life too..this book gives us back this precious insight...<br /><br />the story \\"black and white and red all over\\" is an incomplete jack the ripper mystery and is the best of them all.. it is 100 pages with no ending that ends mid-sentance!!! but when finished i was dying for more....now i will probably never get more but in some cases that is what reading is all about...<br /><br />Buy this book, (Especially the awesome limited edition hardcover)<br /><br />Relic113	2002-11-11
