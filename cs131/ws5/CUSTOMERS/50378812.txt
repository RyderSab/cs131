Martin's writting style is so fresh compared to the cliched plots and storylines that are out there. Each chapter is told from a different engaging point of view. Each character is both heroic and villainous--following their own logical motivations. In fact, these are the most believable characters that I have ever read in a fantasy novel. As for the plot, it is unpredictable. Martin kept me guessing throughout the entire book. My only regret is that the book wasn't longer. I could have easily read another 1000 pages.	2000-12-15

Their 180 degree turn from the previous books was extremely bad characterization. Sadly, the author chose to make his plot hinge on the unrealistic motivations of these characters.<br />Despite that, I found the ending very moving.<br />I have mixed feelings about &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;. If Pullman would have made the change in his antagonists believable this would be a 5 star reccomendation. Unfortunately, he didn't. The series thus has failed to reach its true potential.	2000-12-15

In this story, the JLA crosses over into another  dimension where they meet their evil duplicates the CSA. Morrison's writing  is tight. The story flows really well. I especially liked the  characterization of Owlman (the flip side of batman). Again my main test of  graphic novels is: how do they tie up the story? JLA: Earth 2 passes my  test it ends in an extremely satisfying way. I was left wanting a sequel  and very pleased with my purchase.	2000-08-19

Kaufman's descriptions are not overbearing,  she describes scenes, without you paying attention to the words she uses,  and draws you in. The book read like a conversation with the author over  coffee. Clara the title character and her nemesis Sophie are memorable with  distinct personalities.<br />Oh and to those of you who have read the book  already--one phrase: &quot;Sophie Puppet-time&quot;. I laughed for at least  five minutes. I don't think I'd want Sophie for a pet, but she was easily  my &quot;Favorite Pug in a Supporting Role.&quot;<br />This book was a fun  quick read that I didn't want to end. When I finally finished it, I was  thinking is that it. I wanted the story to keep going. I'm sure you'll feel  the same way when you read it.	2000-08-16

Like some of the other reviewers, I am not in the sterotypical Harry Potter age group--I'm 32. Yet, I read this book in one day. The Goblet of Fire is a classic. Some of the youngest readers will be reading this series  to their children and grandchildren.<br />While I will agree with some  reviewers that this book is darker in tone than the other books, I do not  see this as a bad thing. Read Dahl, the Peach ran over James's  relatives...Matilda had a messed up family...and hunters were turned into  ducks in The Magic Finger. Not everything is sweet and nice in the world,  but good still opposes evil which is a common theme in this series even  when people try to demonize it.<br />I am eagerly waiting for Book 5--even to  a greater extent than I waited for this book--just to see what will happen  next. In light of this story how can anything be the same ever  again?<br />I've been going into withdrawls already and am starting to reread  the series. Don't let the age range amazon lists deter you from reading any  of these books. You'll truly be missing out.	2000-07-24

The world is full of &quot;normal&quot; people bequethed with super powers and those who should have super powers have no memory of their past. The  writing is tight and the story compelling. Why three stars? The adversary  to our heroes is poorly thought out--dare I say stupid (stupid origin,  stupid powers, stupid motivations). When the master plan was finally  revealed I was left thinking THAT's IT! It seemed contrived. It was a  perfect buildup to nothing. This was a good concept that failed to be big  enough in scope. I would buy it if you are really into the Justice League.  There are good moments for all of the cast, but if there are other stories  you could buy first--please do. I don't regret buying this as I am a fan of  the genre. I'm simply disappointed with where this story might have went.	2000-07-07

Ellis's take on the world of Stormwatch is not the  touchy-feely world that is often associated with comic books. It is set in  the dark near-future with the Stormwatch team carrying out international  police actions under the authority of the UN. The writing is great clearly  up to Ellis's standards but it is the characters themselves that make  Stormwatch so memorible. Jenny Sparkes and Jack Hawksmooor were my  favorites. It's an original work and as the first of four collections  definitely worth reading.	2000-07-07

The strength of Ender's Game is not in its Science but in its Fiction. Ender and the other children's characterization is dead on. I had no problem with Ender  thinking the thoughts he did, or acting in the manner he did. His genius,  his isolation, his pain all played well in this story. The entire idea of  the games and the society of the battle room was very well done. I realize  that this book is out-of-print, but I would make it a priority to secure a  copy by whatever means possible. You will not be disappointed.	2000-07-02

I've had this story for about two weeks and I've already read it three times. It surprised me how well written it was. The characterization of the Joker is incredible. I especially liked the Joker's insight into his and  Batman's motivations--everyone being &quot;Just one bad day away&quot; from  slipping off the edge. Unlike other graphic novels that tend to drop the  ball with the conclusion, &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; ends on a very  satisfying note.<br />This story is poignant, well-written, and an absolute  must for any reader of Batman.	2000-06-08

This is one of the funniest, thought-provoking books I have ever read--funny from the first line, thought-provoking weeks after reading it. Vonnegut is very deceptive in his writing. Just when you think you know  what's going on, he turns the story in a completely new direction. I was  kept off-balance throughout the entire book.<br />The book puts you in a  strange quandry: you want others to read the book, but as you read it you  want to share outloud almost every scene. It would be easy for me to post  here my many favorite lines, memorable moments, and insights drawn from  this work. It would also ruin it for every one of you who have not yet read  the book. I would not do that you should experience this story first  hand.<br />There is a stanza from a poem by Lucille Clifton that is strangely  appropriate to &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; even though it deals with an  entirely different subject matter. In this altered paraphrase of Clifton's  words, Cat's Cradle &quot;is a political story is a war story is a  universal story but it is not about these things this story is about one  human heart this story is the story at the end of the world.&quot;	2000-06-08

So why three stars, because the writers violated the premise of this Elseworlds story: a world without a Superman had a Superman. It was a shame because the characterization of  the rest of the JLA, most notably Green Lantern, Batman, and Hawkwoman, was  very well done. It would have been a better story if Batman would have won  the final fight...with a timely assist from Oliver Queen--I was annoyed  that they didn't reintroduce the Green Arrow subplot. If the story would  have been handled in this way, I would have rated it 5 stars. As it is,  it's still worth reading--it's just not what it could have been.	2000-06-03

I am a Christian, yet I have no problem with this book,  nor do I feel reading it amounts in any way to &quot;devil-worship&quot; as  has been suggested by some.<br />Let me illustrate my take on this:<br />First,  in no way can Lord Asriel be called a sympathetic character. He's a  horrible father. He has a dangerous ambition. He sacrificed a child. He is  not shown as noble in any way. That factions are forming around him, only  speaks toward his charismatic personality.<br />Secondly, The subtle knife is  believed to be able to kill the Authority (God). Until it accomplishes this  feat it is all speculation.<br />Until, the third book is written it is  premature to speak toward the author's motives. Characters may be  blasphemous, or liars, or murderers, but that does not mean the author  condones these behaviors. He is simply telling a story. If you don't like  the story he's telling you are free to criticize it, encourage others not  to read it, and move-on to other books. That is your right.<br />That said, I  will exercise my right.<br />I believe this book is better than &quot;The  Golden Compass.&quot; I thought the characterization of Will was flawless.  The plotting is incredible. I am fully involved in the story from  cover-to-cover. The only area that bothered me was Will's meeting with his  father--I did not like the resolution. I do not want to ruin the story by  being more specific, but reflecting on that point for those with  objections, notice that Pullman painted a witch in a extremely unflattering  way.<br />All things considered, Pullman has been fair. People have always  railed against the church, and questioned God's love in light of human  suffering. I think addressing this question through a second potential war  in heaven is not only appropriate, but gives the plot an epic feel.<br/>If  you are not comfortable with the themes than by all means read something  you enjoy. I however love these books and am anxiously awaiting the  conclusion.	2000-05-31

I had been aware of newscasters and officials speaking out against the &quot;gang problem&quot;, but until this book it had all seemed very far from my  experience. Sanyika Shakur pulls you into a world of gangs and violence  from the first page. Scenes from this book will stay with you and haunt  you. Reading this is almost like living in another person's mind. I thought  Shakur's comparisons of gang-life to being a soldier in a war were well  thought out. There isn't much to say about this book, its sort of like the  scene in the &quot;Matrix&quot; take this pill and you can never go back to  the way things were...read &quot;Monster&quot; and you will never see gangs  and the environment that spawns them in the same way.	2000-05-31

In this volume, you DO NOT GET stories of the Fatal Five, the Adult Legion, or the Sun Eater. The reviewer must have been thinking of another volume. In  this volume you get the creation and exploits of the Legion of Substitute  Heroes. It's not the best period for the Legion, not even close, but I  don't regret buying it. I enjoyed many of these older stories. If this were  a stand-alone volume I wouldn't have liked the included choices, but as  part of a nine volume set, I think they are representative of this period  in the comic's history.	2000-05-31

When I started out in this field, it felt like I was learning a foreign  language--and I was. This book will prove invaluable to as you as you work  your way through a hoarde of acronyms that most people using them can't  fully explain when questioned.<br />Bruce from Dallas, raises a valid point,  the definitions do not stand on their own to fully explain the concepts. If  you are coming to Telecom for the first time, and that is what you are  looking for I would recommend the &quot;Desktop Encyclopedia of  Telecommunications&quot; by Nathan J. Muller. This book deals with fewer  terms than Newton's but goes into greater detail. If that is still not  enough try the &quot;Voice and Data Communications Handbook&quot;. Newton's  though is still valuable and has its place. It should be used to spell out  acronyms. That is what its for and that is what its good at. I refer to it  at least five times a day, and I buy every new edition. It is a valuable  resource.	2000-05-31

I was amazed at how little I actually knew about financial matters. I saw myself clearly in some of the characters, as I too was  living beyond my means, and had no plan for retirement.<br />The book's  narrative style makes it very readable (and there are not many financial  books that can make that claim). It will not tell you what to invest in, or  how to make a quick million. What it will help you do is set a solid  foundation for your future. I am happy to say that I have finally freed  myself of high interest credit card debt, and am now beginning to invest in  mutual funds. I owe a lot of my initial impetus to reading this book. The  principles in this book should be taught in highschools around the country.	2000-05-30

I don't say that lightly, Adams put so much into this story (even the chapter titles are thought-provoking &quot;Like Trees in November&quot;).<br />It is easy to dismiss this as a  children's book about rabbits. It is about rabbits, but its not just for  children. A great deal of thought and research went into this novel. The  rabbits are seen as distinct individuals--whom we can relate to and share  in their sorrows and triumphs. I cried. I got angry. I cheered for them. It  is rare for a book to fully capture my emotions in that way.<br />The reader  is immersed in their culture, motivations, and language. The folk tales  which form the basis for their mythology and spirituality could stand on  their own, as is the case with, &quot;The Story of Rowsby Woof and the  Fairy Wogdog&quot;.<br />The rabbits are presented with many obstacles, not  the least of which, is one of the great unrecognized villans of literature,  General Woundwort, leader of Efrafa.<br />This book works on so many levels.  It would be a shame if you missed out because you thought it was just a  children's book. This is a book suitable to be read and re-read throughout  your life.	2000-05-27

This isn't  Tolkien, Eddings, Jordan, Brooks, Goodkind, Tarr...or any of the others.  This work stands on its own merits.<br />Reichert builds an interesting world  full of intriguing characters. While I will agree with one of the reviewers  who said that there was no clear protagonist or antagonist in this story, I  do not see that as a flaw. It is not always clear in life who is the  &quot;good guy&quot; or the &quot;bad guy&quot;. In exceptional stories,  the good aren't all good, and the bad aren't all bad. Is there violence in  this story...yes. Again no apology needs to be made, like it or not,  violence is a part of the genre. If you have a low tolerence for violence,  may I suggest the Myth books or Pratchet's Discworld novels.<br />My only  complaint with this series--and it's minor and doesn't hinder me from given  this book and trilogy 5 stars--is Reichert's take on swordplay. Armor and  sheilds hinder combat rather than help it? Tell that to the templars! It's  an interesting combat philosophy, but if it were really used the Renshai  would have been slaughtered centuries before.<br />That said, Reichert is a  good author, with a strong grasp on character development and interesting  plot twists. I fully enjoyed all three books and was pleasently surprised  many times with the direction the story took.	2000-05-27

Why was this poet included? Or you included him/her and didn't include this poem... Are you insane? The benefit of an anthology is that it can introduce the reader  to poets that they may otherwise never come in contact with. To that end, I  am thankful to Moyers for introducing me to the work of James A. Autry and  Lucille Clifton. I also enjoyed many, but not all, of the interviews. This  was a good book.

Putting everything in a chronological order was interesting and a great choice. I especially liked Chapter 3 (Judgment Day) and Chapter 4 (The Death of Gwen Stacy). The art  was spectacular, but what made this story work was the viewpoint character  Phil Sheldon--He was a layered, flawed everyman capable of both courage and  prejudice. Through his journey, and the lens of his omnipresent camera, we  are given a perspective on the familiar that we might have missed the first  time around. I also really enjoyed Busiek's take on our favorite Bugle  Publisher, J. Jonah--dead-on. It made a nice contrast having Phil and Jonah  play off each other.<br />All-in-All a fantastic addition to the genre.	2000-05-26

With his father presumed dead for the past fifteen years, a government for the haves and not the have-nots, and the Justice League of America with a rent-a-cop attitude, Superman's son awakens to his  powers and his true identity.<br />Is his father still alive? What was behind  Superman's disappearance? How will the world deal with the Son of  Superman?<br />I liked how these questions were answered, but I left wanting  more--maybe that's a good thing. However, I would have liked to have seen  more detail on the changes in the world, more of the oppression that the  terrorists were fighting against. I also wanted the battle at the end of  the book to be a little longer.<br />Beyond those comments, this is a good  story. It's worth buying. Like one of the other reviewers had mentioned, I  would also like a sequel.	2000-05-26

These villians hate anyone who is different. Thematically, then this is an ugly story that serves as an  allegory on human hate and prejudice. It's a worthy read.

Whereas, in Elmer Gantry, Lewis turns religion into a business. Elmer Gantry is a very real portrayal of a man who is ecstatic about his religion, but it is all  an outward show for profit. We might be tempted to think that the  corruption evident in modern televangelists is a new occurence. Lewis  proves us wrong. Lewis shows the entire spectrum of christian belief in  this novel from hypocrisy, to agnosticism, to an abiding spiritual life.  Despite the fact that Lewis is one of my favorite authors and this is a  superior novel, there was one disappointment. Near the end of the book,  Gantry is confronted by the book's one genuine believer. There was a lot of  emotional tension in the scene, and I felt Lewis just let it slip away. It  was an unsatisfying resolution after the build up. Beyond that one moment,  It's one of the best works of fiction I have ever read.	2000-05-25

They fail to see that this  story is the introduction to a wonderful world, every bit as fully realized  as Lewis's Narnia with characters as memorable as Dahl's Matilda, and James  and the Giant Peach.

On one hand, I thought the characterization was believable and the story had a fine premise. Unlike other reviewers, I liked Silverberg's take on the aliens. It was good that  they ignored us. I liked that they didn't have human  motivations.<br />However, the end of the book really broke down for me. I did  not like how the character of the computer hacker/savior was written, and I  hated the end. It felt like it was just pasted on. It was a definite let  down. I am not saying that it should have ended like an action movie, but I  would have appreciated a more satisfying conclusion. I just don't believe  that Silverberg gave it a lot of thought. It felt like I was reading a high  school 2,500 word essay with the author counting the words and suddenly  cutting off when he met the requirement.<br />Silverberg proved to me that he  was a good writer with the first 300 pages. However, the last 100 pages  seemed to be a confusing aberation.	2000-05-24

Peter David has a great handle on these characters, and the dialogue is both believable and fun.  The Stone/Picard confrontations were wonderful. Stone is similar in type to  David's New Frontier captain, MacKenzie Calhoun, at least in the first four  installments of the New Frontier. After that, Calhoun was toned down. Stone  never got toned down. He's high-octane and quite memorable. Sadly, he's  probably a one shot character, but I would love to see him again.	2000-05-24

I had never heard of James Thurber up to that point. The next day, I bought this collection, mainly because it had Walter  Mitty in it. I lucked out, the rest of the collection is  incredible--especially the semi-autobiographical material. It's hard to  chose favorites but I'll try. I loved &quot;The Owl Who Was God&quot;,  &quot;The Dog That Bit People&quot;, &quot;The Catbird Seat&quot;,  &quot;The Unicorn in the Garden&quot;, &quot;The Car We Had to Push&quot;,  and &quot;Draftboard Nights&quot;. Considering the length of my favorites,  I might as well have just copied the Table of Contents.<br />That been said,  Thurber is a fantastic writer, with great humor, and penetrating insight.	2000-05-24

The fact that Judith Tarr places her saga in a detailed historical setting makes this a great series. Tarr has a strong  grasp of the middle ages church, and manipulates a few details to place an  elf in a monastic setting. The characters are fully realized to the extent  that you empathize with their pain and get caught up in their stuggles.<br />A  worthy read.	2000-05-23

Like all technical books it depends on what you're looking for. If you are approaching this as a person with little-or-no ATM experience (i.e., you're not an engineer and for whatever reason you'd like a basic understanding of  ATM)--This is a good resource. Also, if you are someone who trains the  non-technical and you'd like a book that helps you translate ATM into  ENGLISH this is a good pick. And let's be reasonable here, at this book's  low-price, you're not really making that much of a financial commitment.  The information in this book helped me to screen the more expensive books so  that I could do further research.<br />Bottom line: If you're someone that  knows nothing about ATM and are afraid that any book you purchase will be  over your head, rest easy, and order this book. If however you understand  ATM and are looking for a detailed treatment on the subject consider  migrating to other sources.	2000-05-23

Sproul's teaching on Total Depravity truly opened my eyes.  It firmed up for me my place in the universe, God's place, and the level of  grace and mercy that I had received.<br />That is not to say that I didn't  throw the book across the room a couple of times during the process.<br />My  favorite parts of this book were Sproul's treatments on Romans 3 and Romans  9. It took about two years to come to terms with the shifts in my  theological perspective. This book has helped me to understand God's  sovereignty and to take comfort in the fact that all things are under His  control. It's good to be liberated from the image of a God who's wringing  His hands wondering if people will accept His gracious offer.	2000-05-22

I like what this publishing change has done for the quality of these books. Conant, always a  good writer, has expanded her typical story length by a good hundred pages.  This allows her to fill her stories out a little more making the pace and  flow of the plotting better.<br />Diehard mystery fans might be disappointed  with the level of mystery in these books. There is a mystery but it isn't  that intricate, nor is it approached like a typical mystery novel.<br />The  strength of these books is the information, research, and history given of  dogs and show events. When I started this series I never though a dog  mystery could be interesting in any way. But like any good author, Conant  is able to fuel her passion into her writing getting you caught up in the  enthusiasm. I've learned a lot about dogs reading these books, and I've  enjoyed every minute of it.	2000-05-19

I blame a lot of the problems on the poor characterization. I will use one subplot to illustrate this.<br />Case in Point: The fumbling relationship of Cameron  &quot;Buck&quot; Williams and Chloe Steele.<br />First, I must say this entire  dating subplot seems frivolous and selfish, when you consider that the  world is ending and the Antichrist is seizing power. Against this backdrop,  Buck wants a girlfriend. This storyline is base pandering to the  audience.<br />But since it happened, let's analyze it. While I am glad that  the authors kept these books from being sexually charged. I find it hard to  believe that Buck was a good-looking, successful, famous, war-time  journalist that got nervous at the thought of kissing a girl. It stretches  credulity to make this character a virgin in his 30's. It would have been  better if the authors had made Buck a less perfect person with a history of  failed relationships, due to his driven workaholic nature. It would have  been nice to see him adjust to a different moral center. Conversion is  supposed to a transforming experience. Unfortuneatly, these characters are  all too perfect to begin with to show any significant change. This is not  indicative of life and is a sign of poor writing.	2000-05-19

What's tragic is that many people dismiss Watchmen because of that very fact.<br />Comic Books are for kids aren't  they? Casper, Archie, Richie Rich...sure maybe Superman. But they're not to  be taken seriously. Are they?<br />If you harbor these feelings do yourself a  favor--put aside your prejudice and read this book. This is a complex  commentary on modern society. From the opening statements in Rorshach's  Journal to the final pages, this story is both disturbing and  poignant.<br />Other reviewers have accurately said that it is the best work  of its genre, that its art, story, and characterization are vivid and  arresting, but that falls short of describing the story's true impact. If  there were a list of ten great books being put into a time capsule to  identify us as a people, Watchmen, by its own merits, should be included.	2000-05-17

The story is captivating.<br />Highlights include: The Magog/Superman/Joker subplot, The Batman/Wonder Woman Interchange at the great battle, and Superman's confrontation in the bar (One of my  personal favorites).<br />What really surprised me was I liked the portrayal  of Captain Marvel. I didn't think that was possible. Extremely well done.<br />I Loved the basic theme: What is the effect on humanity when surrounded  by super powered protectors? How do we derive any identity or autonomy when  surrounded by beings godlike in their scope? Are our dreams or  contributions even important? This work ranks just below Watchmen as my all  time favorite of the genre.	2000-05-17

Perhaps, the best writen Vampire story ever. And with no criticism intended to modern vampire tales, this intuitively feels like the right era to set the action in--gaslight,  shadows, superstition vs. reason, London.<br />What's not to like?<br />The  characterization is well done,especially in the case of Ysidro--who is  complex and layered. As far as the mystery goes nothing seems formulaic--it  is compelling and engrosing.<br />If I could give it more than 5 stars I  would. It's that good.	2000-05-16

MacDonald's writing is incredible. Mcgee is likeable and  interesting. It is fun spending time in his world.<br />If you're new to the  series this is a great place to start.	2000-05-15

It's always scary trying a new author, after 20-30  pages you can usually tell whether you've wasted your money, or whether  you've discovered something great--many times you've wasted your money.  This was not one of those times.<br />This book captures your attention and  takes you on a thought-provoking ride. I agree with the other reviewers who  noted characterization as a strength. Bron changes dramatically over the  course of the book. I also felt that the pacing of the book was a  strength--I lost the perception that I was reading and got caught up in the  story.<br />This is so different from a standard &quot;fantasy&quot; book.  Strauss has given us a fully-formed original world that is worth  experiencing.	2000-05-14

It's similar to when you tell a friend whether they should see a movie or not--pay full price, matinee, wait till video, or don't bother. With books its--hardback,  wait for paperback, hope your library has it, or don't bother. Clive  Cussler is hardback all the way. Fortuneately for those of you new to the  Dirk Pitt Novels, you can get hardback quality at a paperback  prices.<br />This is a great place to start this series. Dirk Pitt takes on  James Bond--Ok not the REAL James Bond, but I'd like to think that the  outcome would be the same. The entire North American Treaty concept is  engrossing, and the plotting is fast and furious.<br />This book is in the  upper tier of Cussler Novels, along with Treasure, Cyclops, Dragon, and  Deep Six.<br />Enjoy.	2000-05-14

The poem &quot;Joy  Road and Livernois&quot; is worth the price of the book.<br />If you write  poetry you will find the risks Piercy takes in her work instructive to your  own writing--at least I have.	2000-05-12

The main character dies on the first page and begins to relive his past 25 years, making different choices, answering those questions that we all seem  to have. What if I knew then what I know now? Would it make a difference?  Would I be more satisfied with my life? You leave this book with the  awareness that each moment is precious, and it causes you to re-evalute  your priorities.<br />I can not remember the last time a book has impacted me  in this way.	2000-04-25

I had no real problem with Hanegraaff's first book, &quot;Christianity in Crisis&quot;, because  my own research confirmed many of the quotes attributed to the faith  teachers in question. However, this book has incredibly poor scholarship,  and as other reviewers have said it is full of strawmen. Hanegraaff has a  tendency to attack a person, or make innuendos, rather than scripturally  address a subject. I left this book with a plethora of acronyms, and more  alliteration than I could bear--yet I found it lacking in much true  substance. On a side note, I noticed that his own church, Calvary Chapel,  was spared the brunt of his attacks (this leads me to believe that there  must have never been any error in Calvary Chapel). This is no attack on  that movement, but in my experience if you dig beneath the surface most  movements have their own errors and have the need to repent and grow (i.e.,  Paul's letter to the Corinthians). There were many times this book read  like a personal attack, a man responding with venom, rather then with an  objective critique. I find it hard to believe that Hanegraaff is concerned  with the repentence of the ministers' involved. They have already been  written off as false prophets and heretics. This may be, but it is  ultimately God's call not Hank's. I can already hear the argument,  &quot;but we will know them by their fruit...&quot; But when your brother  sins the goal is restoration.<br />In the end, I see little of value in this  book, and cannot in good conscience reccommend it.	2000-03-02

MacDonald book and my first Travis McGee book. I had heard that MacDonald could flat-out write, and I was not disappointed by this book. What I enjoyed the most was MacDonald's insight into the human condition; he really understood what motivated people. This helped  his plotting and dialogue seem fresh and real even after 30 years.<br />I'm  hooked. If you haven't read MacDonald you're missing out.	2000-02-28

I read the Compass of the Soul and its predecessor in under four days. This story was more important to me than sleep, as I stayed up late each night to find out what would happen. The characters were layered and believable; their motivations complex. I will disagree with a previous  reviewer, just a difference of opinion on one point I liked her review, I  appreciated the way magic was portrayed in this book. Eldrich was shown to  be powerful through others' deference, through subtle aspects of light and  shadow, in essence through his intense presence. If magic would have been  displayed more openly, I think it would have detracted from the mood that  the author was trying to set--the sense of mystery. I believe this choice  was made to underscore the fact that magic was soon to pass out of the  world. Or to use an illustration in the book...the tide of magic was  ebbing. Ultimately, I enjoyed reading a book where the author didn't write  to the lowest common denominator, and assumed his readers could think.	2000-02-12

Sadly, I agree that that is what they are. The dialogue is too forced--Too formal, too stilted, too much telling rather than showing the action in progress to be anything else. The authors needlessly point out that his excellency never uses contractions--let me point out that the authors don't use good characterization or dialogue. Let me restate from my earlier review of Left Behind that they can't write women well. Let me also emphasize, as a plot point, that it might have been interesting if Nicolae didn't pray directly to Satan and honestly believed in what he was doing--Oh I'm sorry that would make the antichrist a layered character that may be a little to difficult for these authors.<br />So here I am compulsively plowing through this series saying to myself, &quot;Just one more book and you're done.&quot; Seems there's too much profit to be made and six more books are slated. Six more books full of Miracle Gro formulas, Women feeling like Schoolgirls, Oh and for the witnessing tool crowd, butchered misaplied bible concepts and passages. I came to this book thinking that it had an interesting premise. I only wish it had more capable authors. And if it is truly supposed to be a witnessing tool, more capable theologins.	2000-01-21

These authors have a tendency to tell the reader that a character has a certain attribute, rather than showing  the character exercising that attribute. Don't tell me that Nicolae is  brilliant and persuasive--Show me(and I'm sorry reciting the names of the  countries of the world is not the example I was looking for). This habit of  the authors is clearly seen in the character of Cameron &quot;Buck&quot;  Williams. We are told about 100 times that he is Buck because he Bucks the  system--Show him doing that and let the reader process it subconsiously. I  am also of the opinion that the authors couldn't write a believable woman  at gunpoint. If I hear one more female character refered to as whining, or  that she feels like a giggling schoolgirl I'll scream. The authors also  have a tendency(which continues in later books) to have characters address  each other by their formal titles after awhile Captain Steele and Mr.  Steele gets old. There should be a little more informality as characters  become acquainted. Finally, The discovery that made Israel Prosporous and  made Nicolae's rise posible--Miracle Gro--Please.	2000-01-06
