I loved all 3 short stories. All of them could hold their own as a full length novel. My favorite out of the 3 was \\"Fair Exchange, No Robberies\\" by Danielle Santiago. It was a heart breaking story about Nicky and Lovi, and just when they find true love in each other, things take a turn for the worst and death does them apart. But TN Baker and Tushonda Whitaker's stories were real good too. I read this book all in one day, it was that good! Ladies keep doing your thing. Triple Crown don't be playin'!!!	2005-09-26

Joseph was a good book full of drama, drama, and more drama. I really enjoyed it.

Erica is still hurt over her ex Kenny cheating on her and getting another woman pregnant, when he pops back up in her life after 2 years, she doesn't know how to act. Shay , Mike and Ahmad from \\"The Womanizer's\\" also appear in this book. I loved this book, I only wish things turned out differently for Carmen and Jordan. Good job, Mr. Joseph!	2005-09-23

Ice eventualy ends up in jail and his manhood is put to the test.This hot novel is full of revenge, murder, drugs, money, sex and drama! The ending of this novel is unbelievable!

It was a little slow moving and it was hard for me to stay interested. The story was all over the place and really had no point. It's like the author just wrote a book to be writing a book, there was no \\"message\\". Better luck on the next book, Brandie. Oh and \\"Novelist\\" please believe I ain't hating I read some good books check all my reviews. This was not one of them, you all have your opinion, and I have mine.

Chevy is a fake diva/gold digger who gets some trouble \\"into\\" her, and Ms.Crystal is a sucessful sista who's Prince Charming Kendrick is about to turn into a frog.

It is the story of Dorothy Evans the mother of 3, who is also a drunk, she hates her life and does absolutely nothing to try to improve it. Dorothy drinks to escape the real world. Her nephew Anthony, fresh outta jail is also living with the family. This story made me mad because the author seemed as if he/she was placing the blame for all of the problems on the \\"Man\\". The family lives in the ghetto and can't get out, Mom works a dead end job, and it's all the man's fault. Hell, if the kids would get off their lazy butts, get a full-time job and help Mom, maybe they could get a home in a better neighborhood. Instead they do nothing and remain in the ghetto. Then Anthony decides the only way to provide for his son and family is to get himself killed so they can collect his life insurance. This book is not inspirational, but it seems to make it seem as The Evans family life will always suck, and they will always be on the \\"Southside\\" of Chicago barely getting by.	2005-07-11

If you want some real street drama read anything published by Triple Crown, or even Urban Books, but \\"Crunk\\"...... STUNK!!!!!!! It's way too over the top. Trust me most books I read are fire, but this is terrible.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Street Dreams\\" by K'wan in place of this crap that calls itself a novel!	2005-02-26

I sent the talented Ms. Hobbs an email to let her know just that, and she emailed me back. But anyway go ahead and drop this book in your cart, you will not be dissapointed. It is the story of a young single mom, Terelle Chambers who works very hard to provide for her daughter and to keep her phone on for her man Marquise who is in prison. You know how those collect calls can add up.Everything is all good until Marquise gets a job at the nursing home where Terelle works, and meets Kai. Kai is a bi-racial woman who is very twisted in the mind. She basically hates African Americans because her Black mom abandoned her. Well Kai hooks up with Marquise, and then the drama starts. This book is funny and will keep you hooked. It is very real and I could relate to a lot of the situations. I give this book 10 stars out of five!!!	2005-02-26
