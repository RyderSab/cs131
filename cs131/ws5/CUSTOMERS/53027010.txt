High-level language psuedo-code (not fictionaly assembly language) that's intuitively obvious would save us all so much trouble.  But, why not a \\"TAoCP in FORTRAN-90\\", a \\"TAoCP\\" in APL, a \\"TAoCP\\" in COBOL, a \\"TAoCP\\" in BASIC, a \\"TAoCP\\" in LISP, a \\"TAoCP\\" in ALGOL, a \\"TAoCP in Ada\\", a \\"TAoCP in C\\", a \\"TAoCP in Java\\", etc. ??  Think of the money to be made re-selling it in every possible langauge if there's a market for it?  I might even do it myself and make some $. LOL. Actually, there's no need for a Visual Basic version, etc. because language specific I/O, etc. is not the issue.  This set is about art, about *algorithms*, so most of the high level language specific aspects are irrelevant (except for recursion, details like garbage collection, inheritance, polymorphism...).     Equally irrelevant is worrying about efficient memory usage and the like. Today, memory, disk space, etc. are not scarce resources.  While (being from the old school) I don't believe in wasteful code, all people really want today out of algorithms is optimal speed.  Time and CPU power are the only resources that are still constraints (aside from transmission speed). Discussions about sort algorithms which optimize for anything else (memory space, etc.) are pointless if they aren't also the most time efficient.  We don't care!  Also, unless you work for the US Census or Social Security Administration, you don't care about hardware devices like magnetic tape drives, so those algorithms are just theoretical mind games. Anyway, please rewrite this set in a practical high level psuedo-code with time optimal algorithms only.  But only the timeless (pun-intended) universally necessary algorithms that are always going to be useful.  Stuff like searching, data structures, hashing,  trade offs between techniques. In the future all people will want are   parallel processing algorithms for distributed environments and perhaps eventually quantum computing algorithms for a language built on a CPU which only processes QBits.    One final thing: wasn't there originally supposed to be 7 volumes and only these 3 were completed? What ever happened to the rest? [Update: After 32 years, Knuth is finally dribbling out volume 4.]	2004-03-20

His focus in \\"CS\\" (Computer Science) is actually Electrical Engineering.  Thus, almost nothing is mentioned about the Chess software itself.  What does the evaluation function do? How does Deep Blue/Deep Thought, etc. work? We aren't told much.  So if you want details about Deep Blue, look elsewhere.  If you want to learn about chip design, then this book will interest you.  Mostly, it is a narrative about Hsu and his team and their adventures. It is about Hsu's career and the competition. But not really so much about what went into Deep Blue.  Try J. Schaffer's book, One Jump Ahead. Although it is about checkers, not chess, it is much more interesting from a software development point of view.	2003-02-04

The story of the development (and probably the development itself) of a checkers playing program stopped too soon.  Blondie24 only got to about the 2200 point or master playing level.  If the authors had bothered to let it run for three times as many generations and/or gotten faster hardware, they could have gotten it to play at a much better level.  It doesn't even appear that the developers performed any more generations of self-learning after they improved the program's speed. That doesn't make any sense. They should have optimized BEFORE letting it run for 6 months!! Duh!  So instead of proving that they could let a program teach itself through AI to be a really really good checkers playing program, they merely accomplished that they could get it to be a pretty good program that is not capable of beating any real grand master human players.  Furthermore, the authors did not even bother to reveal what the program actually learned: what were the 17 factors the program considers and how did it assess their weightings after the 800+ generations???  We don't know, because the vital conclusion is mysteriously missing!  So what we are left with is really only half a book and only half a story. If the authors had waited a year or two, got another couple thousand generations of the faster program under their belts, used at least a 1 gighertz system instead of a 450 mega hertz system, and revealed what Blondie figured out about checkers... then you would have a whole book.  Instead, what they have presented is almost a waste of time.  I guess they were so impatient that they just wanted to publish a book... even just half of one rather than doing it right.  A much better book is the longer One Jump Ahead, by Johnathon Schaffer.	2002-01-17

It seems like a novel-length update of Asimov's nearly half-century old story &quot;The Dead Past&quot; (published in 1956!).  That story relied on neutrinos (not wormholes) to view the very near present (although the  device described there could NOT be used to view the truly long-dead,  ancient past).

Plenty of human interest &amp; bio science	From the author who founded neurogastroenterology. Gershon gets pretty technical, but even a layman (like me) is drawn into his interesting subject. The book chronicles his thirty years of research into the  &quot;second brain&quot;: the independent nerve mass literally in the gut.   Probably most doctors today aren't aware of this whole type of nervous  system even though its presence was discovered decades ago.  (This is why  digestion is not affected by spinal injuries.)  Somehow this body of  knowledge was forgotton by medicine. 'Eclipsed' is the word the author  uses.  Gershon &quot;rediscovered&quot; the existence of the second brain  and began doing research in the 1960s about the affect of neurotransmitters  (like serotonin) and their effect on this bowel brain.  In the process of  his narrative he explains how different chemicals (like Prozac, LSD,  adrenaline, acetylcholine, puffer fish toxin, etc) can affect the brain and  the sympathetic and peripheral nervous systems. He also discusses diseases  like Alzheimer's, etc. The best part of the book is the author's personal  family stories which he weaves into his narration. I was very touched by  the story of his mother's death from a bleeding ulcer, surgery and  subsequent stroke, and Alzheimers. The only problem with the book is that  it is at once too long and too short.  Too long because sometimes it gets  too technical and was a little hard for me to stay interested and excited.   Too short because in spite of covering thirty years of research the story  is only a prologue.  It's part one and part two remains in the future.   What are the implications of the second brain?  Will knowledge of how it  works help cure diseases? We begin with a monumental reawakening.  A  re-acknowledgement that the second brain is there. What it means we still  don't yet know.  We have learned that ulcers are caused by viruses.  That  some depression may be depression of the bowel brain.  That Alzheimers  effects both brains.  But we don't know if problems with intra-brain  communication can cause illness.  Have we been treating the wrong brain?   Can autism and Parkinson's disease be better treated by concentrating on  the gut brain?  So much promise for the future, yet still a lack of  answers. I finished the book feeling a little incomplete.	1999-01-06

(Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	About life,death,honor, right, wrong, justice, prinicples	I would compare it to Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday.  Sometimes it  seems like a silly game, at other times it's the answer to deep  philosophical questions.  You must suspend your belief a little and accept  the premises.  The Assination Bureau is based on certain rules.  It tries  to perform social rights by doing what could well be considered wrongs:  executions of anti-social baddies.  But there's a big difference between  murder-for-hire (no matter how &quot;justified&quot;) and capital  punishment by a real government.  Playing by the rules of the game, London  sets up a clever situation where the organization must destroy itself to be  true to its own principles.  But as men of principle and reason they whole  heartedly embrace their own destruction.  Should rationality be held to be  of a higher importance than life?  Is playing by the rules more important  than survival?  When does rationality become irrational or irrationality  look rational? Though not always convincing, this book asks and answers  many interesting questions.	1998-09-24

Starting in elementary school, I read and re-read this book over the years.  I knew the section on the Great Depression almost by memory.  So, when I saw the updated version, I had to buy it to  replace my worn, dog-eared paperback. The original only covered the US up until about 1960. Unfortunately, the additional chapters were done by a new author (the original one had died). So I was very much looking forward to reading about the history of the US that I had actually lived through in my life.  However, when I read the new chapters added to my beloved book I was horrified.  The outrageous bias shown by the new author was disgusting.  Aside from the chapter on the Bush years, the last few chapters are incredible distortions (though well written) of reality.  I was forced to take scissors and cut these pages out!  Unfortunately, even this history cuts off in 1992 so it will be a long time until the next update.  I can only hope that history is written without such &quot;political correctness.&quot; I was very disappointed with these last chapters --- and I was saddened that such a respected book could be destroyed by such garbage.  So I rate the book a 10 until recently added pages, which I rate a -1 for awfulness.	1997-11-19

NOT because of his intelligence.  But because  physically no 6-11 yr. old is capable of doing  the things in the book.  He's really more like  10 years older than he's supposed to be.  Even at age 25, I found it hard to believe in  Ender as a governor of a colony.  (Ironically, after a book worth of Ender as  as a youthful child, the next book makes him  practically immortal.)  Also I couldn't stand the Mormon subtext that  Card puts in the book (you've got to look VERY  close to see the sexism and the elitism).  Also, the language bothered me and prevented  me from giving this book to my child. (How many  times must Card use the word &quot;bastard&quot;???)  And some of the violence is very unnecessary.  I would have liked to re-edit this book for  Card yet another time and clean up all the flaws.  Also, the demise of Peter was oh so convenient.  And I always felt Peter was misunderstood.  Furthermore, the re-appearance of Mazar was so  very perdictable.  One more re-write and this  book will rate a 10.	1997-07-18
