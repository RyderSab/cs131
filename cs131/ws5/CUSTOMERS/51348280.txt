Blood Money is one of the best literary sequels I have ever encountered, perhaps even TOPPING its predecessor.  And yet, more than a sequel, the 2nd book works best as the second half of the story begun in Bait Money. <br /> <br />This book makes an EXCELLENT companion piece to Collin's book \\"Tough Tender,\\" which reprints two other books in this same series (Hard Cash, Scratch Fever).  Put them together and add the final novel, \\"Spree,\\" and you have an epic potboiler that is unequaled in mystery fiction	2004-11-11

But if you sit down and pay attention, and actually intend to READ the material, it is brilliant work.  Noun/verb/adjective.  First grade stuff.<br />Once again Ellroy has taken awful people and made them compelling.  I started out horrified, and then suddenly found myself drawn into their stories.  I found myself worrying about them.<br />One of the most satisfying aspects of the book is its length.  This is no afternoon picnic, or two-day read.  You commit to its size, you commit to the characters.  You spend a lot of time with them.  It makes everything that happens in the story immediate for the reader, and makes you part of the gigantic steamroll through history.<br />Let's just hope Ellroy doesn't take 10 years for the final book in the series.	2001-05-17

The Nitti Trilogy (True Detective, True Crime, and The Million Dollar Wound) rank among the best detective novels  of all time in my view.

I'm astounded that Harlan Ellison thought to publish such a work.  Not only does he malign the dead, who cannot defend themselves (and notice he waited to publish it until after Gene Roddenberry died), but he dwells in  poison over events that happened thirty years ago.<br />Further, a writer of  Ellison's experience should know that in television a writer's scripts are  not their own.  He was paid to write a script, just as a mason is paid to  build a wall in someone else's yard.  In this case, Roddenberry's.  I no  longer respect Mr. Harlan Ellison the way I once did.	1999-06-23

Parker seems  to have started telling the same story over and over again, from Crimson  Joy on up to the present.  Spenser always knows what to do to make things  come out perfectly.  Does anyone remember the early Spenser, who didn't  always know what to do?  The Spenser of &quot;Mortal Stakes&quot; (a  brilliant detective novel) who ambushed and murdered the villian and his  cohort so that his clients could get out from beneath their shadow?  I miss  the Spenser who who committed morally suspect acts in order to fulfull his  own personal code.  And then came Jesse Stone, Parker's alternate  protagonist.  He's troubled, he's flawed, he's an incomplete human being  trying to find a new place for himself.  He doesn't always know what to do,  and he has potential to mess up.  Parker was on the verge of rediscovering  depth of character in &quot;Night Passage&quot; and he's found it with  &quot;Trouble In Paradise.&quot;  In the villain Macklin (among  others...all the criminals in this book are amazing) we see a character who  makes sense because his motivations are in place: he's greedy, he wants  money, and he downright enjoys being a criminal.  Further, Parker shows his  incredible understanding of small town Massachusetts dynamics, politics,  and corruption in the Jesse Stone books.  He truly is on the verge of  becoming great again as author.  Give him a chance.	1998-09-28
