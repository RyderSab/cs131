Since that time, I  have read and reread it a whole bunch of times. I have had to buy several copies. My first one fell apart. Second one was all dog eared. Third copy I lost. So now I am on my fifth copy.<br />This bookis unlike any other personal development book you will ever read. Covey's philosophy is all about &quot;Win-Win&quot; and total effectiveness.<br />When I read the 1 star reviews, I have to chuckle and wonder what their lives must be like. I wonder what they read, or even if they read. I wonder how they spend their time (playing pc games like Grand Auto Theft and watching movies like Motel Hell no doubt)<br />I wonder what they do for a living? When people attack very credible authors like Stephen Covey, I have to wonder just how low they can go and just what goes into their minds? If you ask me, these people need this book more than anybody.<br />7 Habits is all about communication. It is from the Dale Carnegie concept only adjusted for the times. It will show you how to improve your personal and business relationships. How to become a better parent, spouse, employee or employer.<br />Needles to say, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I went through 4 copies. And if something happens to my 4th copy, I will get a fifth.<br />Great book from a great man. Also recommend Super Self another super book about effectiveness.	2004-05-02

So far I have gotten about half way through it and already feel changed.<br />To me this is like a mental and spiritual enema. There is so much garbage out there and so man negative influences. Since reading this book I have kicked the beer habit and not longer play pc games. I was hooked. I was also hooked on horror movies like Motel Hell and such. <br />Rather than watch that junk, I am now watching a set of Bible video tapes featuring Charleton Heston. I also went to see The Passion and this weekend started to go back to church for the first time in years.<br />I threw away all the pc games that I had. What a wanton waste of thime that was! Instead, I am researching religious articles on the internet and reading The Bible right along with The Purpose Driven Life.<br />I cannot recommend this book enough. It has changed my life.	2004-05-02

Who Moved My Cheese by Spencer Johnson is also a small book, not much bigger than this excellent book by Wade and has been a best seller and changed peoples lives for the last four years or so.<br />Wade cut his teeth in the real estate business. I like the fact that WADE IS OFFERING a system that has been tested and is based on his own experience. This is NOT a me too generic real estate book written by someone who has never done the business but is only a writer.<br />I am also glad to hear that Wade Cook is back after a sabattical.

Dave Bach's strategies will not only help you create a powerful retirement income, but, it The Automatic Millionaire will also help you live better now in the present while saving for the future and becoming debt free.<br />The hardest of Bach's strategies for me to implement was the 10% solution. Like most people, I always paid everybodyelse  first and found that I had nothing to pay myself. I felt that I couldn't afford to pay myself. <br />Since reading The Automatic Millionaire, I now pay myself first and everyone else still gets paid as usual and on time. I have found that I don't even miss the 10% that I thought I couldn't afford. The fact is, I can't afford not to! <br />I have also opened a IRA and filled out a new w-4 form at work which by itself is paying for over 1/3 of my IRA and increased my take home pay. I have my paycheck direct deposited into my brokerage account and my IRA comes out automatically...I don't even miss the money. And thanks to President Bush, we can all  <BR>now put more into our IRA, 401 (k) and other retirement plans.<br />I have set up my mortgage on a biweekly system and that is saving me thousands. It gets done...automatically.<br />Dave Bach has created a very powerful and effective way to create wealth. His system works and it is easy. And his book is a quick, easy read. No pouring through 1,000 pages of mostly outdated information that doesn't work and trying to figure out what to do. I read The Automatic Millionaire in 2 evenings and went to work right away.<br />For additional reading and education, I also recommend The Millionaire Next Door by Stanley and Danko, The Richest Man in Bablyon by George Clason and More Wealth Without Risk by Charles J. Givens which offers over 300 ways to drastically reduce expenses, money that can be used for investing or paying off debts. You will also find that Givens pushes the 10% solution very strongly.<br />Stay away from books that push &quot;budgets&quot; and are mostly loaded with fluff. I think the only person that made money with a &quot;budget&quot; was the guy who started Budget Rent-A-Car.<br />Which brings me to another strategy that I use and recommend, starting your own business. The tax benefits alone make it worthwhile. I just had my car serviced and ran up a $800 bill. The good news is that since I use that vehicle in my home based business and have a permanently affixed sign on my car, all auto expences are 80% tax deductible! Previously I got 0 tax deductions. Not to mention additional income and additional money that I can put away in a sep-ira or solo 401 (k). Makes a lot of dollars and sense.<br />The Automatic Millionaire is an excellent book to jump start your financial life. I highly recommend it.	2004-02-22

I am constantly amused by that JBQ shill who shows up on every website for every financial book that comes out that does better JBQ's book--which is just about everybody.<br />David Bach has written a very good book  here. Some, you may have heard before but hey, at least it works. Better than th ose frivilous 1,000 page books written by magazine authors who don't know beans about personal finance.<br />Follow David Bach's advice to lead you to the Road to Wealth and learn how to true Make The Most of Your Money.<br />I have been following Bach's advice and it has made a tremendous difference in my financial bottom line. Great advice that really works.<br />I do recommend that you read everything you can about personal finance, just get a little annoyed by people who try to tear down people for no reason other than peer pressure and hate to see a very knowledgeable financial author like Bach for no reason other than he has a formula that works and that is helping other people. I guess I'm old fashioned that way.	2004-02-18

If you are considering having a book published, this book is a must. Dan Poyter explains why it is better to self publish than go through the traditional means.<br />Although there are many books on self publishing, Dan Poyter's is without a doubt the very best and probably the only one you need.<br />I have checked all of the other self publishing books and at best they cover some of the information that Poynter has in this book, buut not all. At worst, they are poorly written, poorly organized and some of the authors don't appear to have any real world knowledge. Poynter does and communicates this well.<br />I also like the fact that Poynter does not make a nuiance out of himself with countless book reviews, guides and lists to promote their books. The reason Poynter does not have to do this<BR>is because of all that he is. His reputation speaks for himself. I believe that I have seen one book review by Poynter.<BR>I was also impressed by the number of strong recommendations on this book from qualified sources inside the book on the first page and the large number of book stores that carries Poynter's book.<BR> <br />The Self Publishing Manual is 429 pages and 12 chapters. You will find everything you need to know to write, print and sell your own book. <br />Chapter 8-Who Will Buy Your Book covers mutiple ways to target your markets and get them into major book store chains like Barnes &amp; Noble, BAMM, Borders etc. <br />You will also find 2 appendixes and a glossary that makes even the most naive to self publishing a professional fast. You will find all of the resources you need including addresses, web sites and fax and toll free numbers to reach the proper people.<br />In short this book covers everything you need to get your book self published quickly and successfully. You really don't need any other books unless you just like to read.<br />If you are planning on getting your book self published or are just curious about the self publishing business, pickup a copy of The Self Publishing Manual. It is truely the bible of the self  publishing business and a book that you will not want to  be without.	2004-01-16

You won't find this advice from brokers. In fact, those guys usually cause you to become broker, that is how they got their name in the first place.<br />I am grateful to Wade Cook for sharing these exciting stratgeties. In many ways Wade Cook reminds me of Bill Gates. After Microsoft was created, a whole new industry came about and many new companies were spawned thanks to Mr. Softie. Likewise, prior to 1994, how many books, websites, seminars were around on how to cash flow the stock market? I rest my case.<br />Wade Cook is an innovator and although currently in ch. 13 bankruptcy, could and probably will re-emerge as the top stock market learning system in the world. Global Crossing came out of bankruptcy, so can Wade. In fact, that is probably the reason for the 1 star reviews.<br />By the way, isn't it interesting how everyone that slams Wade always has a website to promote? That should tell you a thing or two about their real interests.	2003-12-11

You will develop proper mental mindset that can take you from where you are to where you want to be.<br />After buying the book, I ahate to admit this, but my buddy allowed me to dub his audio and video tapes.

Feeling a little guilty, after I bought a few properties I went out and ordered both the basic program and the advanced 'Millionaire Training.&quot;<br />DelDotto was not only one of the first to teach powerful wealth building, he was also one of the best.<br />I find it interesting that much of what DelDotto taught is the same information in the so called newer books today.

You work a lifetime and hope to retire but find that mutual fund managers have been using illegal trading practices or your funds have underperformed the broad market.<br />Or your company stock goes south right before you are ready to retire or even worse, your company goes south and youh ave no job and no retirement!<br />When 2016 comes, even if you have made good choices, babyboomers take their mandatory withdrawals and suddenly it looks like March 2000 to October 2002 only in days, not years!<br />Robert Kiyosaki is sending out the right message. You must take control of your investments and you must think for yourself. Far too many people are playing the &quot;what should I invest in&quot; game with their broker, financial planners and advisors and ending up broke and confused.<br />I highly recommend Rich Dad's Prophecy for anyone who has money or plans on putting money in the markets from now to 2016.<br />Good book - great advice.	2003-10-30

You'll be in control.<br />Taxes and lawsuits are two of the biggest deterrents to building and keeping wealth. Sutton explains how to substantially reduce taxes (even FICA!) and insulate yourself from the something for nothing crowd that love to sue successful business people.<br />Own Your Own Corporation is a must read for anyone in business or anyone who is contemplating forming a corporation and laucnhing a business.	2003-10-05

I find the continous slams at Wade and his books amusing. I also find the reviews libelious, if Wade chose to go that way.<br />It just goes to show how desperate some people are to attack successful business people like Wade. One reviewer writes; &quot;Those who can do, those who can't teach.&quot; Obviously this remark is way off base. Wade can do both. Another reviewer writes; &quot;Don't buy this, there are better books.&quot; Interesting, this reviewer makes no articulate comments as to what the other books are or what is wrong with the advice in WSMM#2. But--this reviewer is so typical of the Wade bashers which really amounts to 1 person.<br />Anyway, WSMM#2 is an outstanding book. You will learn all about options; buying calls, buying puts, naked puts, covered calls, stock splits and more.<br />This is not WSMM#1 in another cover. It takes over where WSMM#1 Leaves off. And by the way, WSMM#4 picks up where Stock Market Miracles leaves off.<br />I highly recommend WSMM#2 to help you turn the stock market into a Money Machine. Advice works, but be careful. MARKETS, as Wade advises, can turn quickly and lopp your head off.<br />I also recommend William J. O'Niel's newest book The Successful Investor: What 80 Million People Need to Invest Profitably and Avoid big losses.	2003-09-27

This is Wade's best book on option trading previously called &quot;Safety First Investing.&quot;<br />I recommend that you read WSMM#2 first, then this one. Another book that is excellent is the Complete Option Player by Trester.<br />Options are very powerful tools when used correctly. Wade shows how.<br />Godd luck with your trading!	2003-09-27

Once you begin reading, you won't want to put this book down.<br />You will find insider secrets and other advice that you will not find anywhere else.<br />Chapter 38 - Option pricing is probably the most important chapter in the book, especially for new traders. Trester also includes call and put option tables to assist the investor.<br />Overall, a very good book and a great supplement to Wall Street Money Machine #1 and #2. I would also recommend Wall Street Money Machine #4, which is all about option trading in addition to this book.	2003-09-27

The numerous negative reviews are all from the same person.<br />WSMM#5 is a complete covered call handbook. You will find strategies here that are not available anywhere else. You can get your stocks for free and there is very little (if any) downside risk.<br />Cook even has a stock repair kit.<br />The advice works as those of us who have actually tried it and continue to use it are aware.<br />Ignore that sole negative reviewer. Some people seem to get great pleasure at posting negative nonsense, doom and gloom and just acting foolish. But then again, they are supposed to act foolish that is why they are called fools.	2003-09-27
