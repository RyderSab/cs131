We've over-cabled the world with fiber to the point where shipping data anywhere on the planet is easy and virtually free.  Hence, the Internet and today's software allow us to outsource any job anywhere.  We can also in-source jobs, collaborate on work, and set up phenomenally sophisticated supply chains that invest emerging nations in the mutual creation of wealth. And, of course, we can track packages from Nairobi to Kathmandu.  So many of you may already know this, and might not wish to plow through the front half of what is essentially a 200,000 word primer that certainly feels like a NY Times piece.<br /><br />However, Friedman has amazing access to the world's cognoscenti:  How many authors/reporters spend much time with Bill Gates, John Chambers, Carly Fiorina, Craig Barrett, Jim Barksdale, Sergei Brin, Larry Page, Jerry Yang, Bob Wright and Meg Whitman?  Friedman's interviews leave him with interesting observations such as this humorous, yet instructive predilection from the Microsoft chairman: \\"I would rather be a genius born in China than an average guy born in Poughkeepsie.\\"  The anecdotes keep pulling the reader along.  Even more helpful are the employees of these stars. Friedman is good at connecting with the front-line regional chiefs who are living the globalization: VP Emerging Marktets, VP Asia, CEO of outsourcing firms in India or Jordan, etc.<br /><br />Friedman is spot on with his assessment that Americans risk growing complacent - for instance, we aren't training enough engineers and scientists.  But his tone throughout tends to be alarmist.  Indeed, China is not \\"furious\\" that Japan has won the battle for a pipeline from Russia...if fact, the Chinese trunk lines will be built first.  And his Bush-bashing, particularly in the closing chapters is unnecessary, and not fully articulated, (nor wholly warranted.)  Readers need to remember Grandma's warning not to believe everything you read in the newspaper.<br /><br />Strap on your seatbelts and pack a snack because this 469 page odyssey is an observational geo-political-techno tour that goes everywhere:  social activism in Cambodia, AIDS in Africa, schools in India, drive-throughs in Missouri.  One learns how to assemble a Dell laptop from parts around the globe. The book is a bit far-flung in scope, and drags in parts.  Nonetheless, it is thought-provoking, highly current, and offers interesting perspective on issues challenging the Muslim world today.

McCullough weaves a rich illustration of our American history with such lush fabric, the reader is enveloped from start to finish.  The story opens on Thursday afternoon, October 26, 1775 as George III opens Parliament and races through the year 1776 to end in the wintery fields of New Jersey.  McCullough divides the book into three parts, (1) The Battle of Boston (2) The Battle for New York and (3) the long retreat and thrilling conclusion at the Battles of Trenton and Princeton.  I read it, as did many others I know, with a long pause for air after the British redcoats or \\"lobsterbacks\\" are chased from Boston Harbor by Henry Knox's brilliant delivery of cannon from Ticonderoga to Dorchester Heights.  Then, once restarted, I could not put the book down as the author races  through the torturous losses and retreats from Brooklyn to the Delaware...the pacing is a wonderful gallop.<br /><br />McCullough's thorough research ties together much communication and many ponderances of the players.  He constantly surfaces amazing text from the critical letter sent from one general to another.  The treacheries of General Washington's second-in-command, the worries of the commander-in-chief, a mis-opened letter and its gentlemanly disposition by Washington.  Through these lenses, McCullough provides us a brilliant look into the minds of the principals: Washington, Greene, Knox, Mifflin and the many others on both sides of the war.  We begin to wonder would we too have doubted the great Washington on a cold wintery retreat?  Would his replacement have been a better choice?<br /><br />Everything hung in the balance.  And almost constantly.  That is the overriding message McCullough delivers.  Were it not for fortunate winds, or miraculous fogs, incredulous inattention and poor judgements at just the right time...the American revolution might easily have come of naught.  Just as General Washington ventured within mere yards of capture or death, the American cause frequently flirted with disaster.<br /><br />McCullough paints Washington fairly.  He brings out the general's foibles, but ultimately elevates him due to unfailing leadership and pure perseverance, and it is this quote from Washington with which he fronts his novel:  \\"Perseverance and spirit have done wonders in all ages.\\"ture or death, the American cause frequently flirted with disaster.   <br /> <br />McCullough paints Washington fairly.

Largely unknown, his compositions with the pen encompass more than 100 poems and a healthy smattering of prose.  A few were published, but most were left behind in a rough assemblage of his journals and notebooks.  In 1972, as part of a doctoral dissertation,  Marshall Tymn compiled and edited these to produce this tidy volume of 105 poems.<br /><br />As with his prolific paintings, Cole's poems reflect an awe of nature.  A romantic through and through, Cole waxes lyrically about the rugged beauty of mountains, lakes and valleys of a newly found rural America.  Tymn points out Thomas Cole's love for mountains; they fill his large ornate canvases dwarfing any small human figures that may appear.  A devotee of the Catskill and Adirondack regions of upstate New York, Cole embraced the outdoors with religious ferver -- he praises it unabashedly:<br /><br />\\"The Hudson lies below, a mirror'd Heaven\\"  and<br /><br />\\"No!  Tis Niagara shouts from the abyss\\" and<br /><br />\\"Before thee lies the Holy Lake outspread\\"  [Lake George]  and<br /><br />\\"Hail Monarch of a thousand giant hills!\\"  [Mt. Washington]<br /><br />Tymn, in his introduction, points out that Cole's poetry is not the burnished work of Wordsworth or other romantic poets.  Cole never intended as much, and many of the pieces do read more like inspired entries in a diary than \\"higher style\\" verse.  And where Cole left his works unpolished in journal form, Tymn has resurrected the rough stuff, footnoted with explanatory notes, and excellent documentation.  The poems are presented in chronological order: towards the end more verses are penned as letters to friends or to mark the occasion of a death.  The collection also includes four black and white photographs of Cole's work, among them \\"Landscape Scene for the The Last of the Mohicans\\" and \\"The Clove, Catskills\\" both painted in 1827 at the height of Cole's fascination with the romantic landscape.<br /><br />Cole's allegorical lines about the bold American landscape are an interesting complement to his paintings.  Anyone with an interest in the Hudson River School will appreciate this volume.te photographs of Cole's work, among them \\"Landscape Scene for the The Last of the Mohicans\\" and \\"The Clove, Catskills\\" both painted in 1827 at the height of Cole's fascination with the romantic landscape.   <br /> <br />Cole's allegorical lines about the bold American landscape are an interesting complement to his paintings.

Thought by thought Henry Perowne transports us through a Leopold Bloom-like day in London.  From his pre-dawn encounter at the bedroom window with a flaming aircraft to his mind's sinking back into sleepy oblivion a full twenty-four hours later, Perowne faces a unique day-in-the-life.  Unlike the protaganist of James Joyce's ULYSSES, Perowne is witness and participant in extraordinary events, and author Ian McEwan brilliantly unfolds this plot from the vantage point of his protaganist's grey matter.  Naturally.  Henry Perowne is a neurosurgeon!<br /><br />Descriptions of daily life are detailed at the slowest possible tempo: we follow each perception, thought, brainwave down each pathway through Perowne's brain.  The most mundane and stultifying trip to see mother in the old folk's home; the rapid-fire calculations of time, distance and risk during an unlikely knife fight; the angles of return on a squash court; political positions; family relationships...what an infinite number of thoughts cloud the brain each day!<br /><br />McEwan deftly comments on even forgotten thought:<br /><br />\\"He should look out what William James wrote on forgetting a word or name; a tantalising, empty shape remains, almost but not quite defining the idea it once contained.  Even as you struggle against the numbness of poor recall, you know precisely what the forgotten thing is not.\\"  Anyone in his or her forties, as our friendly brain surgeon is, recognizes this early deterioration of the brain.<br /><br />SATURDAY is one of those deliciously rare books that become more enjoyable the closer the reader comes to the end.  I wanted to slow down my reading of it, savoring McEwan's writing; alas, someone was waiting for the book - I had to speed through to the conclusion.	2005-04-25

It had a catchy title, a vivid book jacket, and a promising subject: an expos&eacute; of what modern life inside an exclusive New England preparatory school encompasses.<br /><br />What I read disappointed.  Lee Fiora is a shy girl from a middle class Indiana family.  She had done well in elementary and junior high school.  Unassisted by her parents, and unexplained by the author, she wins a scholarship to toney Massachusetts preparatory school, \\"Ault School.\\"  Once on campus she is intimidated by the beautiful people, turns inward and whines her way through four years.  She is a self-made underachiever and loner, a classic introvert. She excels at nothing, hides in her room for most of four years and dotes on the big man on campus.  So, ho-hum, quickly PREP becomes less a lens on life in an exclusive academy and more of an insufferable tome on the social perils of teenage adolescence.  We certainly didn't need to center the book in a prep school; any secondary school in North America might have sufficed.  And yes, anyone who had difficult self-centered moments during their teen years, (not you - right?) might identify with Lee.  But it doesn't make her any more interesting.<br /><br />At 403 pages it is too long.  Character development of the most interesting possibilities at the school - the \\"bank boys\\", the kitchen staffer, or the teachers come to mind - isn't permitted by the total self-infatuation of the protagonist.  She never gets to know anyone, she complains; sadly, neither does the reader.  If F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about the rich being very different, we certainly cannot turn to PREP to instruct us how they differ.  Except for the use of WASPY names like Aspeth and Cross and Dede, we aren't really introduced to their worlds at all.<br /><br />It's also old.  This is no view on today's prep school.  No cell phones, no XTC, no form-fitting blouses, no text messaging or Internet or 9/11 discussion.  It all happened in an ill defined  past.<br /><br />This is a predictable, clich&eacute;-filled, portrait of a teen struggling with finding herself.  It's just not very compelling.

You weren't aware that Eisenhower had a top-secret affair with Khrushchev's wife?  Perhaps you need the vivid details of blues impresario Robert Johnson's death?  And have you availed yourself of the former President's plan to snag two terms in the White House...by building a new moon?  Yes, this lunacy and much more fun awaits in this file of T.C. Boyle short stories.  These pieces, penned for a host of magazines (Antaeus, Antioch Review, Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, Iowa Review, Oui, Paris Review, TriQuarterly, and others,) were written earlier in Boyle's career, between 1979 and 1985.  These are entertaining sketches of whimsical, off-beat protaganists and moments in time.  An Elvis impersonator, a yuppie asparagus-crepe eater and his haunting rebel shadow, the survivalist who moves his family to  Montana, a loyal Communist fighting to \\"hold public property sacred\\" in the cold Moscow winter...Boyle unfailingly delivers rare specimens in story after story.<br /><br />\\"There was a time when courtesy and winning ways went out of style, when it was good to be bad, when you cultivated decadence like a taste.  We were all dangerous characters then.\\"  These opening lines from the first story \\"Greasy Lake\\" could describe most all of the zany, complex characters who color these fifteen stories.

The plot races along -- with the help of a Gulfstream Five jet our heroes dash around the planet faster than we can turn the pages.  (Amazingly, they stop and eat in a restaurant exactly once in almost 600 pages.  And a conversation almost breaks out.)<br /><br />Hemingway, he is not.  Michael Crichton's characters are two-dimensional sketches of the stereotypes he needs to execute his far-fetched plot.  A nerdy, can't-talk-to-girls lawyer from LA is going to jet around the world in his loafers, saving the beautiful blonde multiple times and rescue the planet from catastrophe?  Peter Evans can barely get a line off: \\"Glad to be of service,\\" is his snappy repartee as our heroine Sarah gushes over him.<br /><br />All in a day's work for the good guys who fight institutionalized pseudo-science and all the evil cooked up by know-nothing environmentalists.  STATE OF FEAR is a black hats versus white hats, good guys (scientists) versus bad guys (environmental activists) dustup.  Predictable and pretty clear which side Crichton backs.  The premise is that the National Environmental Resource Fund (NERF) is having a bit of trouble filling its coffers - a promised $10 million grant fails to materialize as the wealthy old philanthropist, George Morton, is derailed by know-it-all CIA/scientist hero John Kenner.  Kenner pontificates on the evils of data-less science throughout the book, preaching to attorney Evans, George Morton, Sarah, and several Hollywood celebrity tree-huggers.  Meanwhile NERF allies with the Environmental Liberation Front (ELF) an eco-terrorist group bent on proving weather is getting nastier all the time.  Can Kenner, Evans and the good guys save the world from ELF-created ice melts, tsunamis and hurricanes?<br /><br />Peppered throughout the book are footnotes documenting real sources of skepticism about and denial of the warming of our planet due to greenhouse gasses.  For every environmental claim that substantiates a global warming trend, Crichton dishes up a counter claim and what's more - documented references of scientific fact!  In all, an adequate yarn, not too heavy on character development or believable plot, but a creative caveat that warns of the dangers posed by an easily accessible global media.

Several editors are what this oeuvre needs.  Editor Number One would lop off the run-on, overly preachy epistle comprising both the ten page preface and thirty-four page introduction.  I'd suggest scuttling perhaps another two dozen pages from the closing chapter: it is a continuation of the repetitive sermon.  Lynne Truss is worried that text messaging, Virginia Woolf, and the local green grocer each threaten to annihilate punctuation standards of twentieth century English.  She is a self-described fuss about proper punctuation. She would arm us all with whiteout and magic markers, and set us upon the too-easily-found advertisements, road signs and government forms that are riddled with errors.  A comma-less \\"Slow Children Crossing,\\" aggravates her to no end.  Fair enough, but many of these examples are of a similarly low-hanging fruit variety.<br /><br />Editor Number Two would insist on clearer distinctions between British and American standards.  Too often the Yankee reader is left befuddled as to precisely how to employ the mighty comma, or the bracket (that's a parenthesis!) at sentence-end; or whether to trust The New Yorker, Strunk and White, or Lynne Truss.  Her many British colloquialisms overpower the American reader: just when her text is bouncing along merrily in a Monty Pythonish silly-British manner, we're inundated by yet another avalanche of obscurities from the tiny island nation and need to come up for air.  Also helpful would be chapter summaries or definitive lists  regarding the rules. Ms. Truss takes great pains to educate on the deteriorating state of punctuation; disappointingly, EATS, SHOOTS & LEAVES is a poor guidebook.  Another editorial remedy: request that Ms. Truss include her suggestions for recommended resources and further reading.<br /><br />Editor Number Three would insist on more anecdotal sidebars, and famous quotes.  This is where ES&L is at its best.  In her all-too-long fret about the Internet's detrimental effect on written language, she references a gem from long before the Web. A worried Truman Capote commenting on beat author Jack Kerouac's work: \\"That's not writing, it's typing.\\"  Similarly, she borrows a terrific passage from P.G.

Boyle find these obscure figures from history and bring such life to them?  John Harvey Kellogg of cereal fame certainly ranks as one of the oddball physicians of all time.  At Battle Creek, Michigan, birthplace of the Corn Flake, Dr. Kellogg ran a health-nut hotel known as the \\"San\\" in the era of Henry Ford and Upton Sinclair, (both of whom were patients of the place.)  Kellogg's predilection for his new \\"biologic living\\" meant strange meatless diets for his patients, regimens of heavy breathing, regular doses of electricity and radium, strict celibacy, and above all, thoroughly cleansed bowels. The Battle Creek Sanitarium -- you can look it up  -- it was real.  Alone, this boggles the mind.  Then our author begins his fiction.<br /><br />Into this peculiar environment, Boyle drops Mr. & Mrs. William Lightbody of Peterskill, NY as patients of the San; Charlie Ossining, President-in-Chief of a startup breakfast cereal firm; George Kellogg, malcontent son of the famed sanitarium director; Goodloe H. Bender, a free spending business promoter; and a host of assorted iconoclast physicians and malady stricken patients.  Colorful characters all.  Over the course of 476 pages, we are acquainted intimately with the diets, regimens and other prescriptions assigned the patients of the San.  We follow the ups and downs (and deaths!) of these patients, as well as that of the Per-Fo (short for Perfect Food - \\"It Makes Active Blood!\\") Company run by Ossining and Bender.<br /><br />TRTW is a cover-to-cover grin, a farcical look back at a slice in time starring the conniving, the gullible and the deluded.  If you can procure the hardcopy version, you'll enjoy the accompanying period photographs of questionable medical practices prevalent at the San.	2005-01-20

When I spotted \\"T.C.Boyle\\" on the cover of this novel, I thought perhaps here was the same writer whose stories I have enjoyed in the pages of The New Yorker.  Evidently the long Irish middle name is cumbersome for a book jacket, but yes, this is the very same writer, with the evocative prose and interesting subject matter that make for compelling reading.  His ability to transport readers directly into the moment is remarkable.  Herewith, a few lines toward the end of INNER CIRCLE, little to do directly with the storyline, but replete with meaningful metaphor.  It's a quick flashback of protaganist/narrator John Milk as beneath the bleachers at UC Berkeley he awaits the seminal speech of Kinsey's career.<br /><br />\\"The smell - of the adjoining locker room, of the distilled and rancid sweat of the generations  -- brought me back to high school and a reverie I'd had after my concussion on the football field.  They'd brought me into the locker room on a stretcher, my mother's voice floating round the door like a bird battering its wings against a pane of glass, my consciousness fading and then looping back on itself till the world opened up on me like a woman's smile, though there was no woman there, only the grim bald-headed team physician, administering smelling salts.\\"<br /><br />Of course, Milk is no heroic masculine jock.  He's the initial and youngest member of Dr. Alfred Kinsey's research team of the nineteen forties and fifties, a group of young would-be scientists who are cleverly juxtaposed in this scene amid athletic equipment and sports trophies.  No, these young men have stepped aside from the norms of their generation, have missed the war and devoted themselves entirely to Kinsey's over-arching \\"project.\\"  A data collection effort that culminates in the two momentous tomes that have come to be known collectively as the Kinsey Report.<br /><br />These Inner Circle members are sex researchers and employed to collect hundreds upon thousands of sex histories from Americans of all walks.  In fictional style, Boyle describes in clinical tones the process of their work.  Yet, the most vivid prurience only emerges as we step behind the curtain walling off the inner circle, and become voyeurs into their secretive, exploratory personal lives.  Kinsey, his three chief researchers and the spouses of all four push the envelope of sexual mores, in the name of research of course.  The highly sex-charged, ever-inquisitive and insatiable Kinsey leads his young charges and their wives down a destructive path.  It's predictably sad, but fascinating as we watch through the eyes of John Milk the deleterious effects of Kinsey's quest on the relationships and marriages of this inner circle.

Once again, Tom Wolfe provides an amusing spoof of modern American life, this time on a fictional college campus that is #2 in the U.S. New & World Report rankings...right behind Princeton.<br /><br />Matriculating at Dupont, set in Pennsylvania though you could swear this is Chapel Hill, the backwoods country-fried valedictorian Charlotte Simmons embarks upon a calamitous freshman year.  By virtue of growing up in isolated Appalachia in a Norman Rockwell childhood, she is innocent, naïve, of a different time.  And shunned at the ultra-preppy university.  Even as Charlotte's social ostracism forms the central plot, the readers are welcomed into a circle of colorful Dupont undergraduates:  Hoyt - the self aggrandizing frat boy; JoJo - the giant dumb-dumb jock; Adam - the nerdy Rhodes scholar candidate and pizza delivery boy; and Beverly - the Brahmin prepster and bilious roommate.  The stereotypes continue into the faculty and include a charismatic lecturing Nobelist, a Jewish-intellectual sixties holdover, a god-like buffoonish basketball coach and the compromised university president.  Yes, we've met all these caricatures before, and even Wolfe references Animal House as the defining academic movie of our times.  Is the plot arch and over-the-top?  You bet!  It's the Wolfe way!<br /><br />The book is too long by a third, (isn't that reference to the tedious reading of Talcott Parsons amusing?) and can't Wolfe drop the ridiculous \\"loamy loins\\" as his sole description of fleshy desire?  Nonetheless, Wolfe captures the language in the same memorable spirit as his earlier fiction.  Just as \\"social X-rays\\" and \\"master-of-the-universe\\" entered our lexicon 15 years ago, so today we meet up with \\"rutrutrut,\\" \\"sumpin' sumpin'\\" and \\"frostitute\\".  Be forewarned, this is not a text for the scatologically challenged. \\"Know'm saying?\\"  Rap music, frat-boy banter, Blue Ridge Mountain country accents, hoopster trash talking...Wolfe collects all this dialog and reassembles it on Dupont's tree lined campus walkways. I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS takes second place to BONFIRES but is a fun spoof and may be worth sharing with your high-school senior sometime before freshman orientation.Nonetheless, Wolfe captures the language in the same memorable spirit as his earlier fiction.

Linda Greenlaw landed the mother of all catches with her first book, The Hungry Ocean.  Unfortunately, her subsequent work will always be compared with that initial gripping tale of longline swordfishing.  As with her second book, The Lobster Chronicles, this new compendium of fishing tales, in All Fisherman Are Liars (AFAL) she provides an enjoyable, entertaining read, but nothing to compare to the can't-put-it-down original novel.<br />AFAL is an assemblage of perhaps a dozen good stories from fisherman of their time at sea.  Far and away the most dramatic is the tale of David Marks, caught in a Caribbean hurricane in chapter four.  The trouble is we don't get enough to fully satisfy; this one 'Shackleton-esque' story might have made an excellent novel itself.  As with some of the other tales, it begins too fast and ends too soon.<br />Greenlaw uses a one-night gathering in Portland, Maine's Dry Dock Bar as a device to hold the stories together.  Ostensibly she has a lunch date with old friend Alden Leeman, a salty ex-boss and longtime fishing friend, with whom she hopes to have a serious discussion about his health and impending retirement.  Lunch turns into a continuous run of sea yarns from Linda, Alden and various other close friends in their fishing community.  The clothesline on which she hangs the stories droops after a few chapters with the sogginess of her meeting's premise: her concern for Alden's health grows repetitive.  We just want the next story, please.<br />Still, she brings color to her characters and the stories she has collected.  Readers of her previous books will recognize some of the characters and boats.  And the &quot;Bar Snacks&quot; with which she separates the chapters, feed us with amusing tidbits and observations, for instance, &quot;Fibs and Exaggerations of Crew Members.&quot;  An enjoyable summer read.  Keep writing Linda.	2004-07-19

I did not know that it had been headed to Hollywood, but one certainly suspects it.  The book reads like a screenplay.  Colorful characters, enchanting settings and whimsical plotline set up perfectly for a 110 minute trip to southern France on the big screen.  After sailing through a very light 287 pages, I feel I've been 'en vacances.'<br />Descending upon the tiny village of Saint Pons for the summer are:  Max Skinner, our hero who has been tossed out of his financial job in London, but immediately inherits a house with vineyard, Le Griffon, in Provence; Christie, a Californian cousin with a possible claim to the beautiful property; and Charlie, brother-in-law and money lender to Max.  They join the locals:  Monsieur Rousseau, caretaker to the vineyard; Fanny, a temptingly beautiful restaurant owner; Nathalie Auzet, the fashionable local notary; and Madame Passepartout, the matronly housekeeper and village gossip.<br />The storyline bounces from meal to meal, as nothing happens unless accompanied by sausages, pat&eacute;, tarte aux pommes, pastis, marc and plenty of red wine.  Meals at the village caf&eacute;, at the restaurant, at Le Griffon, and most magnificently at the Rousseau home are described in succulent detail.  Evidently, someone is getting wealthy from mysteriously grown grapevines at the far, dusty edge of the property, and therein lies the plot.  An ex-advertising executive, Mayle pokes good fun at the culture of wine marketing.<br />Further coloring the screenplay are the budding romances and the ultimate question of will Max make Le Griffon his home and livelihood.  Hardly suspenseful, but what summer vacation is?	2004-07-07

Wow!  This tale has it all.<br />In a presidential election year, the incumbent and his challenger duel over the role of NASA.  Suddenly, NASA finds the Holy Grail, a meteorite with proof positive of extra terrestrial life forms!  How convenient for the President who has backed NASA.  But he keeps it quiet for a week, while he brings in a team of civilian scientists who can confirm the find.  Among them, Rachel Sexton, daughter of the President's opponent in November, and also Michael Tolland, the Hollywood version of Jacques Cousteau.  Their findings are conclusive...or are they?  Enter killer special-operations teams.  Someone is in big trouble soon!  And to top it all off, the suspense takes shape on top of a mountain of ice high in the Arctic ocean.  OK, so it's a little far-fetched that NASA would go to such extremes to save itself, or even that a US Senator knows how to operate a copy machine, but isn't that why we buy these paperbacks...to suspend our disbelief for a few hours?<br />A super page-turner on the order of the Da Vinci code, Deception Point puts a little ice in your summer reading.

Purportedly a fictional expose of our crass American suburban culture, \\"Little Children\\" turns out to be little more than a 350 page soap opera.  It begins in the hotbed of suburbia, at a playground with a handful of yuppie mothers, and so the book holds great promise.  Perrotta introduces us to some characters we all can recognize instantly.  Frat boy Todd, spandex-clad Mary Ann, practical careerist Kathy, newly retired and bored-at-home Jean, and intellectually under-challenged Sarah cope with various problems and uncooperative spouses.  Then there are the characters that add color to the gray suburban landscape:  Ronnie the child-molester, Larry the ex-cop on a vendetta, and Richard the web fantasy surfer.<br />Unfortunately the book drags these characters through a much too lengthy and predictable melodrama.  Larry harasses Ronnie, Sarah makes a move on Todd, Kathy tries to save her marriage...the novel turns away from what could have been a good satire about suburbia and instead drones on like a dime-store romance.  Who will end up with whom in the end?  Who cares?<br />This book would have been much better had Perrotta concentrated on his characters more intently.  They hold such promise.  Instead they end up flat, shallow stereotypes who move through a lame plot.	2004-06-16

Anne Tyler zeroes in on the elemental matter that comprises most lives.  Will Pauline be brave enough to venture downstairs to restart the pilot light on the hot water heater?  Or will she turn her day upside-down to avoid her basement phobia?  How can Michael possibly decide which impressionist print to mount on his empty walls?  Such is the daily torture of a life filled with the mundane business of maintaining a marriage, raising kids, entertaining friends and relatives, running a small business, driving through look-a-like suburban streets, keeping a house running, feeding everyone and dressing correctly.  Michael and Pauline Anton struggle through this life together, completely mismatched for each other, as a result of an impetuous, romantic wartime sendoff.<br />Tyler sketches their struggles through six decades from their early days in an ethnic Baltimore neighborhood to the present.  In this way, the novel loosely chronicles an evolving nation:  Pearl Harbor and World War II, the post-war flight from the city to the 'burbs, Kerouac and Haight-Asbury, and the aging of baby-boomers into lawyers, financiers and college professors.  But the book is about the characters:  Michael and Pauline, their children Lindy, George and Karen, and another generation behind them.  By the book's end we see Michael's and Pauline's genes at work in their children, differentiating them as much as Michael and Pauline.  &quot;The Amateur Marriage&quot; is a marvelous portrait of family life in America, good light reading, and just the right length.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-06-02

This is a boring march through two cases: (1) the gang-rape of an underage high-schooler and (2) a serial killing couple who kill for the thrill.  Neither case has much dimension or plot, and worse, they are highly predictible.  Then we throw in the love-life storyline of the Jesse Stone, our protaganist, police chief.

One was \\"HomeOwner's Manual\\" by the This Old House crew, and the second was \\"The Walls Around Us\\" by David Owen.  Owen's calming, sensible, everyman approach to shouldering new handyman projects helped steer me through an unfamiliar, mundane project.  At some point during the countless hours of smoothing, sanding, and painting, my inattentive mind began to wonder what else Owen had written besides the occasional New Yorker story that subscribers see.<br />\\"The First National Bank of Dad\\" was the answer, and upon reading its subtitle 'The Best Way to Teach Kids about Money' I scooped up a copy.  Having two little spenders of my own, I knew I needed this new advice manual from a man who has been there before me.  FNBD did not let me down.  David Owen writes with a straightforward, humorous, easy-going style that spews common sense and good ideas.  His Bank of Dad idea is genius, but only because it flips upside-down the usual parenting mantras of command and control.  Put your kids in charge of their money urges Owen, and watch them learn how to spend and save.  Stop running Aunt Millie's birthday presents down to the local bank, which to your kids is a \\"black hole that swallows birthday checks.\\"  Instead, Owen puts his kids entirely (almost) in charge of their money, and with his home-based Bank of Dad gives them the opportunity to learn about the power of compound interest.  Using a home computer and a slightly more influential rate of interest, he quickly captures his kids' attention.<br />It's a terrific idea, one I've already adopted, and my kids are unexpectedly as thrilled as his.  Owen has more.  He teaches his kids free market economics via eBay, creates his own successful Stock Exchange of Dad, and expostulates on the value of part-time employment for kids.  His recommendations are surprisingly fresh, honest and logical.  Chapter Seven offers perhaps the best observations about life and I could think of many adults I know who would benefit from reading this alone.  Chapter Eight is an epistle to the value of reading.  By \\"learning how to purse a subject until their curiosity is satisfied,\\" Owen observes, \\"later in life they will be able to use that same ability to teach themselves about the bond market.\\"  And anything else.<br />FNBD is an investment of under six hours reading time.  It is already paying dividends in my home.fers perhaps the best observations about life and I could think of many adults I know who would benefit from reading this alone.

When Boston Globe columnist Alex Beam alerted his readers last month that he would be escaping Boston's summer convention in July to see for himself the beautiful island that is Newfoundland, he blamed his intrigue on Wayne Johnston's book.  &quot;The Colony of Unrequited Dreams&quot; is a wonderful historical fiction, adding color to the life and times of a man whom others describe as a minor Canadian figure.  But Joey Smallwood, as the last founding father of the Canadian Confederation, having brought the coastal nation into the Canadian fold in 1949, is hardly a minor figure.<br />Nor is he a man to be underestimated, and his desire to avoid this is his driving force. From the time Johnston describes his beginning in rags, a school master advising him he would have a lifelong character score of &quot;45 of a possible 200&quot;, to his ascension to the leadership of the new province, Smallwood is consistently underestimated.  His parents, his teachers, his schoolmates, his employers and political enemies all do reckon Smallwood as someone who won't ever succeed at anything.  He is the story of the island nation itself - underfed, malnourished, bleak prospects, constantly cold or wet, abused, disrespected and unexpected to succeed.<br />Only Sheilagh Fielding, his fictional foil in Johnston's story proves to be a colleague, a friend, a guidepost and believer in Smallwood.  &quot;Unrequited&quot; describes not only the dreams and hopes of the improbable Smallwood, but also the love that these two central characters pass back and forth.  Their relationship, from schoolyard acquaintanceship to golden age acquiescence, threads the storyline together, and parallels the history making in process.  Johnston's Fielding is a self-proclaimed Boswell, chronicling her life and those around her in the steady form of letters written to Smallwood.  Each chapter in the Smallwood tale is prefaced by serious squibs from both the real historical works of D.W. Prowse, &quot;A History of Newfoundland&quot; as well as the hilarious bandit works of our fictional heroine who pens &quot;Fielding's Condensed History of Newfoundland.&quot;  She is also a journalist chronicling the rise to political power of Smallwood, and writes a column for the papers called 'Field Day.'  Her send-up of the actual floor debate on Confederation between true historical figures Peter Cashin and Joey Smallwood left me in tears of laughter.  Johnston's ability to write both in the voice of Smallwood and Fielding is brilliant.<br />Many other passages in the book are memorable including Smallwood's early days in St. John's, a fantastic description of a seal-hunting tragedy, accounts of Smallwood's walk across the province to organize a railworkers' union, and the tale of his journeys through coastal villages and long walk across the winter ice.  Johnston delivers the cold, the hunger and the beauty that is Newfoundland.  If there is a downside at all to this novel, it is that Johnston spends too many pages revisiting the Smallwood-Fielding relationship, when we want more of these wonderful descriptions of Newfoundland, (or &quot;Old Lost Land&quot; as Smallwood's drunken father rails on the back porch at his demons.)  Indeed, those looking for detailed history and deep factual context will not find it here. This is not a history book, per se. Instead, Johnston fills in the black and white history of Joey Smallwood and Newfoundland's march to Confederation with colorful, fictionally rich brushstrokes.<br />In sum, a very memorable read, and I thank Alex Beam for turning me on to it.

Missing are the compelling contemporary issues, high throttled suspense, and all around passions that pervade early novels such as A Time to Kill, The Chamber, The Firm, or even The Runaway Jury. The Last Juror is at least 100 pages too long for its plotline, and its ending is evident long before the final pages.<br />The book starts fast: the story of a grisly rape and murder, and subsequent trial make for some page-turning. A jury is presented with the classic question: life in prison or the death sentence? Hardly suspenseful, for the deliberations (not at all sketched by Grisham) come only halfway through the novel, and the book jacket has all but given the ensuing plot away anyway. So the reader trudges through the next decade of the novel's storyline, year by boring year. Ostensibly, the narrator, owner of the local newspaper in the small Mississippi town (same setting as A Time to Kill) must fill us in on every detail of life that happens between this first trial and the ultimate (hey, no surprise here at all...) parole of the threatening killer. Every column, obituary, advertisement ever published by narrator's paper, The Ford County Times, is chronicled. Grisham drags us through the young man's haberdashery conversion, his social life (quite dull), his religious research (gee, there are a lot of enthusiastic Christian churches in the Bible Belt, no kidding?), and his eating and sleeping habits. By the time the protagonist has built up his business, we feel we, too, have earned shares in the venture.<br />We don't really delve back into any real action until the final sixty pages of the book. OK, again no surprises (it's on the book jacket): someone is killing the jurors who originally convicted our parolee. Even then, there is little suspense. We have the list of jurors, we are waiting for the killings and final resolution.<br />Grisham could have done much better with the topic of parole injustice, and he certainly missed the boat on this one. This book should have been released during the Willie Horton days of Dukakis v. Bush. It might have held more interest.certainly missed the boat on this one.

I borrowed my copy of &quot;One Up On Wall Street&quot; from a friend who is a longtime professional equities investor.  He received this gift as recommended reading from a veteran investment analyst he knows.  While Peter Lynch has written an easily comprehendible advice book on common stock investing - very much written in layman's terms and without emphasis on industry jargon - the principles he puts forth are fundamental and worth reviewing by anyone, amateur or pro.<br />Within the 300 pages of this book, Lynch outlines a useful rubric against which all stock selections might be measured.  His stocks fall into six categories:  Slow Growers, Stalwarts, Cyclicals, Fast Growers, Turnarounds and Asset Plays.  Screening, buying and selling advice are outlined for each of these six flavors, although nothing revolutionary (eg., Sell a slow grower when the dividend is unattractive.)  He delivers a wealth of the basic analytical tools (well, more like rules of thumb) for stock research, explaining price earnings ratios, the import of tax loss carry-forwards, goodwill accounting, inventories, and other basics of P&amp;L statements and Balance Sheets.  It's a pocket guide financial course for those who may have slept through Accounting 101.<br />Lynch urges stock pickers to do their homework, and suggests the regimen of a &quot;Two Minute&quot; drill, whereby an investor can recite a brief monologue of reasons for selecting a security:  Reasons for selection, what the company needs to do to succeed, and pitfalls that stand in the way.  Obviously, this is not a book for the technicians or chartists. Nor even speculators, as Lynch reminds the reader that his &quot;ten-baggers&quot; or &quot;forty-baggers&quot; all come as a result of having held at least three to four years.<br />Quite a bit of the book carries a populist bent.  There is plenty of advice to pay more heed to what's happening in the local shopping mall than to investment brokers (&quot;oxymorons&quot;), and to avoid stocks with exotic names or that may have been whispered to be hot.  Of course, we've all been aware of this, and we're all wealthy and drinking daiquiris on the beach now, right?<br />In sum, it is worth the investment of the few hours it takes to swallow this information.

I have not read the next 19 in the series, and may not.  Regardless, I feel I have invested well, as O'Brian paints a vivid, colorful portrait of sailboat battling in the Napoleonic era.  I picked up an original 1969 copy of the book from the local library, and the dusty old jacket was a constant reminder of just how timeless this story is.<br />Yes, it takes a bit of work and a few chapters to delve into the terminology of the early nineteenth century, but that's not too hard.  And yes, there are entire stretches throughout the novel that are utterly boring...much like being stuck in the shipyard while repairs are underway, or becalmed on a glassy sea.<br />The reader happily musters on though to arrive at a new battle, to learn a bit more about the complex Jack Aubrey or intellectual Doctor Maturin.  Along with the overwhelming technical sailing jargon, O'Brian throws in some pretty wry humor: His observations of the mating Praying Mantis parallels the mating experiences of Commander Aubrey.  For as skilled and adept Lucky Jack Aubrey is at sea, he is mere mortal (and indeed a first rate klutz) ashore.  Just the opposite of his trusty sidekick Maturin, who is a seafaring neophyte, and knows his way around the spars even less well than we the readers do.<br />If nothing else, this tale will have you yearning for a sunny Mediterranean cruise.	2004-02-07

I have been a catechist, teaching elementary school age children for over four years.  I use this book extensively in my sessions with the kids, because they listen...intently.  Rather than many dumbed-down, Disneyesque versions of children's Bibles that I have seen, and rather than the somewhat lame materials offered by our church, the Children's Illustrated Bible connects with kids.  It does not insult their intelligence, but enhances it.  The rich liturgies of the Old and New Testaments are brought to life with vivid portraiture and detailed factual explanation.  Want to know more about life in the Middle East in biblical times?  It's there.  Want to know what type of wood might have been used in the Ark?  Or what mountain range Ararat belongs to?<br />My students, ages 5-9, are harsh critics.  When something isn't real, or interesting, or meaningful, they simply turn off.  Too many of the standard cut, color and paste exercises last five minutes with them.  But when I pull this book out to read the wonderful stories of Noah, Moses, the Flight from Egypt, Jesus calming the sea, and so forth - the kids listen with mouths agape.  They strain their necks to see the beautiful illustrations and pictures.<br />This Bible is an excellent gift for god-children, for nieces and nephews, for your kids.  Even if you are not religious, your kids will benefit deeply from hearing and reading the wonderful tales of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and step up their cultural literacy significantly.	2004-02-04

Dan Brown's 'The DaVinci Code' has been atop the bestseller list for 40 some weeks.  The 'fiction' list.  And the surest way to reach the top of the bestseller lists is to write for the lowest common denominator (in the sports world read: NASCAR) which in this case means - the mystery hound.  The DaVinci Code's appeal is that it is Grisham, Turow, or even JK Rowling, yet  with a religious twist.  Every chapter ends with a pointed gun.  Come to think of it, isn't this how Frank and Joe Hardy move through life?  Solve one riddle, and up pops another.  Everything is life-threatening, world-ending, but avoided by sheer pluck of the hero and heroine.  Turn the page, please.<br />The hook is set on the frontispiece, \\"Fact:\\"  We're in for a duel between the Priory of Sion - a secret society founded in medieval Europe (presumably still alive even in suburban Long Island according to the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut' movie), and the countervailing forces of Opus Dei, a devout Catholic sect to whom the Vatican is beholden.  Immediately, on page one, a murder takes place under the watchful eyes of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre.  So, right away we know we are going to learn more about art and architecture in the next 450 pages than we do about the columns of Mississippi courthouses in a John Grisham  novel.<br />The plot is all go-go, and we're off quickly on a goosechase through Europe, ('mais Versailles, ce n'est pas nord-ouest du Paris, je pense, Monsieur Brun') replete with art, history, symbology and architectural lessons that qualify readers for a minor in liberal arts by book's end.  Papal conspiracies, self-flagilating monks, the obligatory sex ceremonies, hidden gospels, unbreakable ciphers...all the trappings of a first-rate page turner.<br />You have to read it, just to be current, and to fend off all the loonies on either side who scream 'Heresey!' or 'Truth!'  I borrowed my copy from the library, but getting your paperback investment sandy at the beach this summer will be well worth it.ill be well worth it.	2004-01-30

East Buckingham is a thinly disguised Charlestown, Massachusetts: a place where everyone knows everyone else, streets are tough, and secrets are kept.  The story spans a generation and follows the tragic arc of lives damaged by mishap.  Sean, Jimmy and Dave begin the tale as young boys, wrestling and roughhousing in the backyard, until something goes terribly wrong.  We skip ahead a generation to find this wrong has permeated each man's existence.<br />Despite having grown up and gone separate ways, their lives become strangely intertwined again as they are conjoined by this defining moment of their youth. Its consequences ultimately bring them together again, under the  horrific circumstances (including brutal murders) of a new generation.  As the central mystery unravels, the three former chums, and their closest loved ones, struggle with issues of self-doubt, trust, and loyalty.  Time runs short and tragedy repeats itself.  A clever, hardly obvious resolution to the mystery ensues.<br />If the drama itself deserves four stars, Lehane's portrait of the tough, boozy, working-class side of Boston should draw a full five.  One expects Charles or Matthew Stuart to pop up in a dark corner of the townie bar, or Whitey Bulger to resurface in the weeds under the Tobin Bridge.  I recommend this to crime mystery fans, and particularly to Bostonians everywhere.	2003-12-18

This was my first time with a Dennis Lehane novel, and it won't be the last.  Shutter Island is a page turner from the protaganist's arrival on Shutter Island, site of an Alcatraz/ Maclean Hospital style fortress, to the hairy, twisted ending that follows some three hundred and thirty pages later.  Heroic federal marshals, nefarious psychiatric ward surgeons, and a host of colorful inmates at the asylum decorate this mystery that occurs on a small spit of land at the far end of Boston Harbor, and takes place over four days in 1954.  Bostonians will recognize references to the Cocoanut Grove fire, Deer Island pollution, and to nearby locales of Attleboro, Hull and Nantasket Beach.<br />Whereas 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' describes a similar era of mental institutions and delves much more deeply into comic/tragic experience of the inmates, Shutter Island is straight ahead detective work with a psychological twist.  The pages will rush by as you race ahead with the federal marshall and his partner while they hurry toward solving the mysterious secrets of Shutter Island.<br />I recommend this as a great weekend read...oops, they're coming to take me away!  They're coming to take me away.  Have to go.	2003-11-24

Authors Niederman and Boyum articulate that we live today in a new Quantitative Information Age.  Strange then, that they did not entitle their book, &quot;Ten Habits of Highly Effective Quantitative Thinkers&quot; (actually the title of Chapter Two) - this book would have sold twice as much.<br />Ahh!  Twice as much as what?  As Stephen Covey's books?  As much as this book's actual sales?  What's the base?  Now that I've read this &quot;Field Guide to Mastering Our Numerical World&quot; (actually the subtitle,) I am trained to ask the pertinent questions about numerical comparisons.  I have learned to simultaneously &quot;only trust the numbers&quot; and to &quot;never trust the numbers&quot; - habits #1 and #2.<br />In this entertaining tour of today's quantitative landscape, the authors expose our collective inability to cope with numerical reasoning.  From humorous pot shots at &quot;our favorite punching bag, the International Skating Union,&quot; whose farcical scoring systems are easily exposed, to a better method of comparing safety between small plane flying and automobile safety, to famous courtroom misuses of statistical data, Niederman and Boyum demonstrate a growing gap between our increasingly data dependent decisions and our nation's declining numerical literacy.<br />&quot;What The Numbers Say&quot; provides a layman's look at mathematical skills required by everyone.  It is a book for non-mathematicians, liberal arts students, teachers of all subjects, political and educational leaders, and above all, parents.  To anyone struggling with children struggling to master the multiplication table, and wondering what became of the rote memorization and textbooks from earlier days, the authors make sense of the new teaching techniques.  Traditionally, it seems, mathematicians have been Euclideans, &quot;deriving truths, in step-by-step fashion, from first principles or axioms.&quot;  But, &quot;good quantitative thinkers are Babylonians.  They understand that quantities can be measured and expressed in many different ways, and that looking at something from multiple viewpoints enhances perspective and fosters creative thinking.&quot;  Finally, we understand why our kids can't complete the 9-times Table, but are whizzes at stacking Lego blocks.<br />Niederman and Boyum embellish their hypotheses deriving wonderful examples of easy-to-comprehend quantitative situations involving baseball, weather forecasting, popular movies, roulette odds, consumer tips, home finance and stock market analysis, timed swimming contests, fair games, and more.  Readers cannot fail to understand how simple some of the recipes (Pareto's Law, The Rule of 72, how to interpret Zagat's Restaurant Guides) are for understanding quantitative measurement.  Mathematics, long misunderstood as &quot;uncool&quot; for its complicated formulae and notation, in fact, is often a beautiful and handy tool with which to find &quot;the easy way out.&quot;<br />Though the authors uncover highly political ramifications of misunderstood data and twisted statistics (e.g., environmental debates), the book is apolitical save for the last chapter that cries out for educational reforms.  Niederman and Boyum sum the book up neatly with suggestions for educators regarding curricula, calculators, and competitiveness.  They propose ending the &quot;math wars between Progressives and Traditionalists,&quot; and put forth solutions.  The authors' main salvo:  differentiate between mathematics and quantitative reasoning, and offer training on a separate track for each.<br />Put this on your 'to-read' list for the coming year.

Reprinted from the '1967 Sphinx', the class yearbook of The Citadel, it depicts twelve young basketball players posing for their official team photograph.  Author Pat Conroy is the small guy at the front and center of the old black and white photo, kneeling alongside the basketball, a spot typically reserved for the team captain.<br />But we can't be sure he is the team captain, or for that matter, we can't be sure anyone is the captain.  No one actually holds the ball.<br />Over the course of 400 pages, I found myself looking back to this photo repeatedly, as Conroy adds deep dimension into each player's background and character.  Conroy unveils the story behind his team, the 1966-67 Citadel Bulldogs who lost more games than they won, but as he brings forth, learned enough for a lifetime.  &quot;My Losing Season&quot; tells the story of a young man's journey through a very difficult boyhood, his escape into sport, his endurance at a southern military school, his central participation on a team of moderately talented basketball players, and his discovery of language and writing through wonderful professors at the Citadel.<br />Conroy's greatest strength, his strong and unabashed character portrayals, resonates through this book.  Readers of The Great Santini (or viewers of the Robert Duvall movie) will become reacquainted in great detail with the real-life Santini, Conroy's abusive father.  &quot;In My Losing Season&quot;, we also meet basketball coach Mel Thompson, who inflicts psychological terror on his charges, constantly tearing apart his young players and destroying any chance at winning this team might ever have had.  Conroy adorns his professors and deans at the Citadel with laurels for giving him the keys to his future as a writer.<br />But Conroy shines the light most brilliantly on his teammates.  He effuses his fellow cadets with the color that is missing from the front photograph, intimately introducing the reader to his court colleagues.  We learn about strengths, weaknesses, skills, fears, and limitations of each of the twelve.  Four years of coach Mel Thompson, cadet hazings, severely repressed social lives and a total absence of support make for an over-extended &quot;Survivor&quot; episode.  Conroy saves the best for last:  a reunion tour in which he reconnects with each of the individuals on the team and their families independently, thirty years after hanging up his Converse high-tops.  Emotions spill over.<br />Nearly a dozen basketball games are described, in a kind of sepia-toned movie reel, as Conroy relives the play-by-play from his vantage at point guard.  He overuses the flowery adjectives at times (&quot;the beautiful boy&quot; and such) but balances it with good locker room banter and the practical jokes of young men.  The games themselves come alive again, and I found myself rooting for second half comebacks and last second heroics.  You can feel the ball coming up the court, and like his teammates, you wonder where the pumpkin's going to go.  Conroy emotes a strong love for his game, and basketball fans will appreciate the occasional name-dropping of great players and coaches he once bumped into.<br />If you don't have courtside seats to this year's ACC or SEC tournament finals, this book will be a suitable replacement.

I could have enjoyed a marvelous career, replete with Manhattan cocktail parties, summers at Basin Harbor, and literary agents hurling Dreamworks money my way.<br />Perhaps I should steal it!<br />This is the premise behind John Colapinto's \\"About the Author\\" as our protaganist, young bon vivant, Cal Cunningham makes off with a manuscript and crashes through 254 pages of daring do, daring don't and \\"how do I get outa this one?\\"  Sudden fame and wealth, a new love, an old fling, and a ghost author all haunt Cunningham's every move as he continually tries to bury the evidence, but can't just quite.  The manuscript in question, its author, the blackmailing girlfriend...they each seemingly have nine lives.<br />Colapinto displays the wit of a Christopher Buckley, the plot twists of a Stephen King, and the language skills of a Wilfrid Gallimore.  His literary references are cheap and suitably impressive, (Cal retires to \\"New Halycon\\" and paddles on \\"Sylvan Lake\\" in Vermont,) and he brings such tremendous color to characters that one seems to have known them before (Marshall Weibe?)  Surprise deaths,... drug-running, Elvis Costello quotes -- all the requisites of a big money book -- all there.<br />\\"About the Author\\" is a highly entertaining spoof of the publishing landscape, and its storyline keeps the reader turning pages.  Good cricket!  I recommend you purchase a copy immediately, buy another for a loved one, and then additional copies for everyone on your PalmPilot.  Send the royalties to, (ahem), ME.	2003-09-20

Annie Proulx chooses signal a creatively fecund mind.  What on earth kind-of-place must Newfoundland be?<br />The hapless newsman Quoyle leaves behind a tragic and unfulfilled life in upstate New York, and with a domineering, secretive aunt, steers his way to ancestral stomping grounds on the shores of Newfoundland.  Here the quirky Quoyle fits right into a community of goodhearted fisherman, boatbuilders, carpenters, and assorted oddballs. Newfoundland provides for Quoyle, a new found life. Over the course of a year, he finds acceptance and vibrancy in a new community for his family. As juxtaposition, Quoyle's good friend, Partridge, seemingly a guy with all the luck, starts up his new life in Los Angeles, a material world of electronics and backyard barbeques that couldn't seem more foreign to Newfoundland.  And ultimately less promising.<br />Proulx prefaces each chapter with a drawing or quote from the Ashley Book of Knots, (by Clifford Ashley 1944).  The drawings are detailed and correct, and the maxims preface each chapter in an interesting and fitting way.  Perhaps as quick a read as you'll ever have through 337 pages, (and it could have gone much longer), The Shipping News is a flavorful work of Maritimes dialect, fanciful storytelling and hope for the downtrodden everyman.	2003-09-11

The number of times author Bill Bryson uses this adjective in 478 pages must approach Avogadro's Number.  For how else to describe life on earth?  It IS improbable!  Bryson brilliantly brings out the sheer absurdity of our being here.<br />&quot;If your two parents hadn't bonded just when they did -- possibly to the second, possibly to the nanosecond -- you wouldn't be here.  And if their parents hadn't bonded in a precisely timely manner, you wouldn't be here either....Push backwards through time and these ancestral debts begin to add up.... If you go back sixty-four generations, to the time of the Romans, the number of people on whose cooperative efforts your eventual existence depends has risen to approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is several thousand times the total number of people who have ever lived.  Clearly something has gone wrong with our math here.  The answer, it may interest you to learn, is that ...\\"  (Well, I'll not disclose that here, but save it for your reading enjoyment.)<br />Also improbable are the countless scientific endeavors and inquiries over the last few hundred years, described in wonderfully colorful detail by our author.  Kelvin, Count Rumford, Einstein, Mendeleyev, the Leakeys, Linnaeus, Darwin, Cavendish, Newton, Feynman...these are but a few of the famous scientific minds about which Bryson elaborates.  We learn that Newton stuck a needle into his eye socket just to find out what would happen, that astronomer Edwin Hubble was a lifelong egotist and liar, that many would-be Nobel Prize winners had fame snatched out of their grasp by unlucky happenstance or pluckier rivals, and though Caspar Wistar devoted his life to the study of dinosaur bones, he is remembered chiefly for the flowering shrub wisteria named for him by his botantist friend, Thomas Nuttall.<br />The nineteenth century seemed replete with colorful characters sometimes masquerading as scientists, sometimes solving complex riddles.  Among the many oddities and unique personalities portrayed by Bryson:  The nitrous oxide inhaling devotees of the Askesian Society, the archeologist who preferred doing his fieldwork \\"au naturel\\", the astronomers who traveled for years only to miss the marvelous celestial happenstance due to a cloud, and the geologist who would slump to rest his head on chairseats while standing. Always, Bryson injects fascinating asides, strange coincidences, and the most arcane and useful detail.  He does it all with the eye of a terribly interested observer, but not without a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek humor.<br />He closes one chapter that details just how much there is yet to learn about the earth's flora and fauna with a question posed to Richard Fortey at the Natural History Museum in London. \\" `And I suppose that's why you value someone who spends forty-two years studying a single species of plant, even if it doesn't produce anything terribly new?'  `Precisely,' he said, `precisely.' And he really seemed to mean it.\\"<br />The fantastic narrative artfully weaves in and around the truly astounding facts of our universe, solar system, planet, life-forms, cells, and molecules.  Bryson begins the book with an explanation that he has found school textbooks far too dry and their exponential numbering conventions incomprehensible.  He avoids this by a longshot, bringing the numbers alive, always referencing how many `thousand million,' or `million billion' that comprise a large number.  His descriptions of size, from the unapproachable vastness of our universe to the unseen smallnesses of cells, proteins and molecules, are nearly always accompanied by analogy.  If the sun is as large as that depicted in most textbooks, then a true-to-scale solar system has Pluto, not on the foldout leaf, but as an unseeable microbe, several miles from the book.  If you unraveled the DNA found packed into any one of the billions of molecules that comprise you, it would stretch out six feet.  This is the stuff of which great cocktail party factoids are made!<br />This is the best book I have read since the hugely popular John Adams by McCullough came out several years ago.  The level of research alone is astounding.  Bryson seems to have culled everything that ever was chronicled.  Although I am as far from being a scientist as we are to reaching the edge of the universe (discussed by Bryson, of course), I heartily recommend this book.  Improbably.hich great cocktail party factoids are made!<br />This is the best book I have read since the hugely popular John Adams by McCullough came out several years ago.

Not only does she take on a traditionally male oriented world, she wallops it, taking home \\"the golden horseshoe\\" as the best swordboat captain on the Grand Banks.  But don't think hers is a book extolling feminism. Quite the contrary, she insists on being called a `fisherman'.<br />\\"People, women in particular, are generally disappointed when they learn that I have not suffered unduly from being the only woman in what they perceive to be a man's world.  I might be thick-skinned - or just too damn busy working to worry what others might think of me.\\"<br />She beats the boys because her \\"slammer\\" trips aren't a fluke: she employs sophisticated strategy, meticulous attention to detail, and stretches the playing rules to the max. She is unafraid to make unpopular decisions, and to push her crew beyond their limits.  Fans of Larry Bossidy's popular management text 'Execution' will appreciate how Ms. Greenlaw baits and sets her hooks.  Her precision, even in the face of grueling conditions, sets her apart. She is hands-on, with an eye always to the next horizon.  In short, a textbook executive.<br />Her portraits of her crew members (Ringo, Charlie, Kenny, Peter and the tempestuous Carl,) and various fishing comrades are rich, - and in the cases of Jethro, the rookie fisherman, and dear old Uncle Patty - hilarious.  Anyone with a tough boss will immediately recognize the love-hate relationship she endures with her boat's owner, Bob Brown.<br />If you agree that people who take non-traditional routes through life are interesting to read about, choose this 258 page non-fictional account of Colby College graduate Linda Greenlaw and her choice to sail the seas for seventeen seasons of swordfishing.

I read The Lobster Chronicles before The Hungry Ocean, and enjoyed this second tale from Linda Greenlaw.  I know many people who read them in chroniclogical order and were disappointed that this followup story of Ms.  Greenlaw's new life and profession couldn't measure up to her first book.  I disagree.  The Lobster Chronicles describes a place, and a passion for that place, on the part of the author.<br />Anyone who has been to a Maine island will recognize the different patterns and nuances of life offshore.  Ms. Greenlaw brings out the colorful character of a very small and isolated community, and some of the many challenges and benefits it enjoys.  An aging population, quirky citizens, unavailable healthcare, unlocked doors, lack of social life, beautiful vistas, abundant freedom, small town politics...the author provides a vivid illustration of life on Isle au Haut, Maine.  Her passion for the island and its community comes with her bloodlines.  She frequently returns to writing about her family members, and indeed, spends most of the summer running a lobster boat with her father as crew.  With good humor, she parallels her failure to catch lobster with her inability, thus far, to catch a mate.  Ms. Greenlaw writes gracefully and with great nobility about her family's encounter with devastating illness.<br />Warning:  Unfailingly, lobster fans will need to devour a buttery tail or two after finishing this page turner.

Written by Martha Ackmann, a professor of Women's Studies at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, the topic hits an unexpected intersection of interests: Early days of manned space flight at NASA, and women's rights.<br />Most readers won't have heard of The Mercury 13, an unofficial group of stalwart women airplane pilots, all tested for potential to become astronauts by the private Lovelace Foundation at the dawn of the space race.  While national focus lasered on Alan Shepherd, John Glenn, and the rest of the famous and flamboyant Mercury 7 astronauts who flew the first orbital missions, Jerrie Cobb and her compatriot lady flyers quietly matched, and sometimes surpassed, the test results of the male heros.  Accomplished flyers, and businesswomen, the individuals of this group held many aeronautical records and won many air derbys.  Some were graduates of the WAC programs of the Second World War, spearheaded by Jackie Cochran. Ackmann paints vivid portraits of each potential astronaut-candidate, and one can easily like these devoted flyers. (Interestingly, the author focuses heavily on the self-destructive political infighting between Cochran and Cobb for leadership of the women-in-space program.)<br />It's fascinating to \\"uncover\\" this group some forty years later. Who knew?  Beyond a few publicity shots that appeared in Life magazine and in hometown papers, the women were hidden, unsanctioned as an official group of any kind, almost a curiosity.  Yet, many points raised by Professor Ackmann are provocative:  Women weighed less than male counterparts - and would require less rocket fuel; and why was there a requirement of jet-flying experience for astronauts when many animals (female, no less!) were sent aloft in the space capsules.<br />So where's the argument? Clearly, Ackmann launches this retrospective on the women-in-space efforts with the intention of demonstrating blatant sexism and its negative effects.  Viewed through the lens of post-feminism, one clearly sees malfeasance - from President Johnson who nixes any further testing, to a Neanderthal congressman who jokes about the need for women in space for reproductive purposes to colonize planets.  Yet, a young and innocent John Glenn just can't see beyond what he and America know as the social norms of the times.  In 1963, the nation was a decade away from any kind of equal opportunity awareness, and perhaps two decades away from the emergence of political correctness.  Were the male leaders of the space program worried about protecting an existing social order, or just worried about beating the Russians to the moon?  Therein, the debate.

Just in time for the great Red Sox season of '03, the one in which they definitely will win the World Series, comes this rich portrait of four former Sox teammates:  Bobby Doerr, Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky and the immortal Ted Williams.  David Halberstrom's book could almost be an addendum to Tom Brokaw's Greatest Generation, this chronicle of four Depression-era scrappers from California sandlots and their lives both between the lines and, just as interesting, outside them.<br />In just under 200 pages, we travel with DiMaggio, Pesky, and friend Dick Flavin from Massachusetts to Florida to pay one last visit to their beloved teammate before his death.  We learn about the remarkably similar paths each player took to the big league Red Sox, and what a different world baseball was before free agency.  We get a peek at the closeness between these men - a bond stronger than family ties.<br />It's remarkable, for instance, to learn that Joe DiMaggio, the great icon who hit in 56 straight games, led the Yankees through all those glory years, and married Marilyn Monroe, actually felt that his brother Dominic had bettered him in life.  Dominic a successful, always hardworking businessman, retired wealthy after running a manufacturing company and had a tighter relationship with Ted Williams than with Joe.  He was there for Ted, visiting and calling every day right up to Ted's death.  It's remarkable that each of Ted's teammates Doerr, Pesky and DiMaggio seemed to have had more successful lives outside baseball than Ted ever could.  Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio...American legends, yet they never had much success with families or work...precisely what Ted's teammates were great at.  Doerr, Pesky and DiMaggio all had long-lasting marriages, nobly battled illnesses and infirmities of old age with great dignity, and led happy, productive lives.  We learn that Ted, never really got past a very bad childhood, and perhaps, never grew up at all.  He simply wanted to be the best hitter that ever was.  And he was.<br />There are many good baseball stories involving players of all generations:  Ty Cobb sends a letter of hitting instruction to Ted Williams; Willie Mays was almost a centerfielder for the Sox; Johnny Pesky wasn't really the goat of the '46 World Series;  Bobby Doerr's wife Monica was oblivious to the devastating playoff loss of the `48 Sox to the Yanks...she welcomed an earlier vacation to the Catskills.  Even the stories told in the car headed south are vintage dugout banter:  While Pesky snoozes in the back, DiMaggio and Flavin argue about how to shave a mile or two off a cross-country car trip by shifting lanes through the turns.<br />Dan Shaughnessey, the great Boston Globe sports scribe who covers the Sox, wrote today in his column that this book is required reading for members of Red Sox nation.  I echo that and suggest that anyone with a love of the game and its history will cherish this keepsake of an earlier time in baseball history.st hitter that ever was.

Pretty fun spoof of the PGA, the LPGA, Microsoft, ESPN, political leaders everywhere, the CIA &amp; MI5, and that whole Sansabelt fashion thing.

If that is your turn-on, you may enjoy it, but even so, it's a pretty slowww plot line.  It takes half the novel, just for 'the Kinkster' to recover from a hangover and get on a bus with Willie Nelson after he has been invited.

Anthony Swofford revisits his days as a sniper in the Marine Corps, and takes us along with him from boot camp to Operation Desert Storm.  The language he uses, and stories he tells may shock a naive reader, but to anyone looking for an up-close-and-personal from one who was there, this tale is awesome.  If you want more of an in-depth interview than Ted Koppel interviewing some career army colonel who is all spit and polish, check out the message that Marine Lance Corporal Swofford sends home.<br />Swofford pulls no punches.  He describes the physical brutality of boot camp, and the hardening of eager, young, lovelorn souls into battle-ready killers.  Before being deployed to Saudi, his troop enjoys its final days Stateside watching Hollywood war movies meant to shock liberal, peace-loving Americans on two coasts. Instead, the young jarheads (haircuts high and tight!) eat it up, whooping and hollering to Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter and the sort.  They \\"watch the same films and are excited by them, because the magic brutality of the film celebrates the terrible and despicable beauty of their fighting skills.  Filmic images of death and carnage are pornography for the military man.\\"<br />Once in the desert, one feels it.  Swofford describes in detail what it is to live with sand in every crevice of one's body, to sweat all day in a useless chemical suit, to be assigned the task of disposing of the latrines.  The importance of constant drilling, of staying sharp, of cleaning a gun countless times each day pay dividends...later they learn how poorly the Iraqi regulars maintained their weapons.  But for the long stay of many months before battle the drudgery seems endless.  The psychological impacts are many.  The pain of separation from family and friends; of the desertion of girlfriends, wives and cheating lovers; of fear and uncertainty mounts exponentially.  Swofford makes it abundantly clear how dangerous it is to take very impressionable young men, to hype them up into killing warriors, to deprive them of basic humanities, and isolate them in god-forsaken parts of the world for months on end.  It's quite a recipe.<br />I laughed out loud at his story of the \\"Any Marine\\" letter writing.  Swofford has a natural ability to drop the reader into a panoramic and colorful scene.  You'll feel you're in his foxhole, endlessly shoveling the collapsing sand alongside him.  The dialogue is rough and tough.  And real.  He isn't just any jarhead, he's the company \\"scribe\\".  He's the guy reading Nietzsche and Homer.  This is his Iliad.  I recommend you read it now.

The former Senator and Governor from Nebraska, Robert Kerrey leads a team of highly trained Navy SEALS on two fantastic missions into backwaters of Vietnam in October of  1969.  On one his team scales huge cliffs and battles heroically against fierce opposition.  Kerrey suffers the loss of a leg, and is saved by a fellow SEAL.  That mate, Gerhard Klann, a decorated veteran of Vietnam, Iran, and Iraq, now a steelmaker in Pennsylvania, reveals to writer Gregory Vistica a second, very different mission on which Kerrey led his SEAL team.<br />That over two dozen women and children were cut to shreds by a hyper-aggressive team of US warriors at Thanh Phong is never disputed.  What Vistica brings out though is the constantly wavering, growing-shadier-by-the-moment, inconsistent memories that Robert Kerrey provides of the tragedy.  Were they fired at first?  Where were participants standing?  What was the mission?  What orders did Kerrey give?  Vistica explores in some depth, (much more is needed) each perspective.  Klann never wavers in his story.  Seemingly, Kerrey continually wavers.<br />Furthermore, Vistica unveils a lifelong pattern of wavering on the part of the former Senator and Presidential aspirant.  Should he accept a medal from Nixon?  Is he a Democrat or Republican?  Did he raise the endowment at a University or not?  When is he telling the truth?  Before I read this, my image of Kerrey was precisely what Vistica describes as the \\"idea of him rather than the reality: hero from the heartland, boyfriend of a movie star, governor, senator, and presidential candidate.\\"  Vistica's book is not the uncaring attack of an over-zealous journalist, but he attempts to debunk the golden-boy myth that surrounds Kerrey.<br />In the end, the reader must judge how much is truth and how much is spin.  \\"Quagmire\\" is a description frequently applied to the Vietnam conflict.  Reading through these conflicting accounts of Thanh Phong, one realizes what an appropriate term that is.  It is hard for any non-combatant to comprehend what that moment could possibly have been like.  The result of a frightening, ill-advised, dangerous  confrontation, far from home one evening long ago has had very long repercussions.  It makes a civilian most appreciative of anyone serving his or her country, especially those on the front lines.  A provocative read.ription frequently applied to the Vietnam conflict.

I picked up \\"Blue River\\" after breezing through two delightful reads, \\"Emperor of the Air\\" and \\"The Palace Thief\\" both by Canin.  I recommend reading every one of the short stories in each of these two volumes.<br />\\"Tedious.\\"  This word kept popping into my head while I labored into \\"Blue River.\\"  I thought it was me.  Surely this story would improve and flower into a marvelous and richly colorful Ethan Canin story.  75 pages, 100 pages, 150 pages.  Would this ever develop into something readable?  Should I give up?<br />I didn't.  And I had to laugh at all the other reviews here on Amazon.com  \\"Tedious\\"  \\"The shortest book I never finished.\\"  Naturally.  They are all correct.  Believe the negative reviews.<br />\\"Blue River\\" is a hugely disappointing, cliche-filled, seemingly unedited, overly stylistic diatribe that is boring.  Not very far along in the book, the protagonist yuppie eye surgeon is \\"chasing his demons\\" and daring to drive through Pacific Coast Highway switchback turns with his eyes shut late at night.  Uh-huh.  Most assuredly, you too will root for a good car crash.  No such luck, however, and the reader is taken back through an awful Cain and Abel coming-of-age saga set in Blue River, Wisconsin high above the banks of the Mississippi.  The worst part is that it is written in this horrific style of a letter from the younger, angst-laden yuppie brother to the older miscreant brother.  \\"Lawrence, you didn't know I knew that you knew\\" sort of technique.  Ugggh.  Spare us.<br />It's a shame this book turned out so badly because Ethan Canin is a very talented writer.  I have confidence this was an early set back in a very promising career, and I look forward to finding the next Canin novel in my public library.	2003-01-27

First, \\"the feel of fear\\" as an infantryman entering World War II at Omaha Beach on D-Day and his surviving countless adventures as the Allies drive to Berlin.  Liberation of Paris, the surrender of an entire town to him personally, meeting Patton...one begins to think he is an erudite Forrest Gump - he is simply everywhere at the important moment.  Second, his colorful career in journalism, from covering death-row executions in Florida as a young beat reporter through his long career at the center of the literary world as editor of The New Yorker.<br />\\"`Before I blow out your brains' - what a way to talk!  What melodrama!  What had happened to me?\\"  As a GI, Botsford wrestles in Europe with the demons of war...perhaps solid preparation for future traumas he would witness at home in New York.  Booze, mental depression and suicide were to elite wordsmiths what heroin became to jazz musicians, and Botsford's life is touched repeatedly by the loss of his colleagues.<br />One expects chapters upon chapter of WASPy high society lifestyles, but Botsford indulges the reader only with a taste of his pre-war jaunts through Hotchkiss, Yale and the Ubangi Club.  Neysa McMein, famous socialite and illustrator, (but not Botsford's mother as indicated in the PW review posted here) is featured: a fellow native of Quincy, Illinois, Neysa introduces the author's parents to New York.  Alexander Wolcott, Genet (Janet Flanner), Wolcott Gibbs, AJ Leibling, and scores of famous New Yorker writers and editors are recounted.  Naturally, Ross and Shawn, the great legends of the magazine serve as bookends to the Botsford career.  But you don't have to be a great student of The New Yorker to appreciate this memoir.<br />Maeve Brennan's insouciant letter detailing a Christmas in the Hamptons (\\"It will be a long day before I have `house guests' again.\\") is a scream, and worth the price of the book alone.  You'll also enjoy Wolcott Gibbs' 10 general rules for editing New Yorker writers.  Equally amusing is Gibbs' editorial answer to a book publisher in Chicago with six accompanying notes (\\"#4. `For it was apple-blossom time in Normandy' is, I'm afraid, arch at best, and the ragtime beat is not appealing to the ear.\\")<br />Mr. Botsford's keen sense of humor echoes throughout the memoir.  He constantly watches for those taking themselves too seriously, and finds a treasure trove of these unfortunates in the US Army, in American politics, and in the editorial corridors of New York City.  Even his best friend before the war, Bill Verity, (aka, Monsieur Calvini) does not escape his wit...alas \\"he took up the corporate ladder, became more stone-minded, was appointed as Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Commerce - he was lost forever.\\"  Those who are too officious find little room in the privileged life of Gardner Botsford.

A copy of Roberts Rules of Order, having been unread for about 60 years, once flew off the shelves of a library in Shelbyville, Indiana, travelled thousands of miles, leaving a plume of library dust over 5 western states and landed in the swimming pool of a Hollywood film producer, leaving the movie maker so shocked he had to discontinue production of a screen adaptation of Huckleberry Finn starring cute computer generated alien creatures and a giant green bean.<br />So kids, if you don't want your overhyped PG movies delayed or you don't want to wear helmets in study hall...READ THIS AND MANY OTHER BOOKS!	2002-11-29

If any one of these authors was ever important to you, please pick up O'Hara.  He's critical to understanding twentieth century American authors.  At the very least, you can engage in the unending debate on whether he's worthy of joining this pantheon of writers.  Worthy of an airport paperback rack?  Smalltime trashy romance writer?  Or do you think he paints a richly textured canvas of an America and its high society about to be turn the corner on the first half of the 20th century?  An important Irish-Catholic writer?<br />My tip:  read this book.  If nothing else you'll learn about  bituminous and anthracitic coal, the United Mine Workers, how to mix a martini, (and throw one), why fraternities were ever important, and what a flivver was.  It's certainly a period piece, and O'Hara does not hold back with the language of the jazz age...which may confuse modern readers (it was a gay party, his chains dropped a link, etc.) In fact, O'Hara was an early adopter of using slang and vernacular in writing the spoken word, and you can be the judge of whether or not he gets an Irish mobster's (or a \\"high hat's\\") tone correctly.<br />He's really at his best with character development, because Julian English (our protaganist) is our bigoted confidante, our tiresome spouse, our wretched boss, our surly neighbor, our spoiled college-boy brat, our pretentious friend and our preening big man about town all in one.  O'Hara waltzes us through Julian's  demise and we root for him, for one more chance, all the way down.	2002-10-16

C'mon, Ivan Lendl owes his career<br />success to Johnny Mac calling him names?  Making excuses<br />decades later that he and doubles partner Peter Fleming<br />lost a match in LA, DUE TO SMOG?  He lost a Wimbledon<br />finals to Connors...because he missed the retired Borg?<br />No one ever approached the net with a defter racquet than<br />JMAC, but he still needs to be visiting his therapist.<br />Even so, for avid tennis fans, it is a fun trip down<br />memory lane to read about all the greats that this game<br />has served up from Don Budge to Leyton Hewitt.	2002-09-13

Read this book with my 8 year old daughter and<br />6 year old son last night.  We had returned recently<br />from our family's first forays at a campground, so<br />the kids smiled all the way through the book with<br />the shared wisdom of veteran family campers.  If you<br />have ever had to share a tent with school age kids,<br />you will smile, too.<br />Most excited to read Deborah Gould's bio on the book<br />jacket and learn about her inspiration...Lake George<br />island camping at age 8.  This is our FAVORITE place in<br />the whole world, so we identify closely with Ms. Gould!<br />Thank you to her, and to Diane Paterson for a magnificently<br />illustrated children's book.<br />Now, how can I order more copies for gifts?	2002-09-13

But I forgive him for being too rah-rah with Adams and entirely too harsh on Jefferson...for this book makes a strong statement for the man from Quincy, and boosts him at least to a new height (if not to the immortal stature of the Virginians.) The cross Atlantic adventures, the mid-winter rides to Philadelphia and the brilliance of young John Quincy Adams are fascinating.  If you read one book this year, choose this.	2002-01-08
US	51806550	R3KIC9I1IJGHVH	067102082X	385052238	The Gun Seller	Books	2	3	25	N	Y	Unmemorable	Not really the up-to-snuff, top drawer Brit humour we expect from Hugh Laurie.  I'm writing this 6 months after reading the book, and really I remember very little of the book.  &quot;Unmemorable&quot; must be my final thought.	2002-01-08
US	51806550	R34A3MYUH22LCC	0896585751	374867198	Magic Time (History & Heritage)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Home Run	The Publisher's Weekly review above pretty much misses the central thesis:  Does Mike Houle want to live an assured life &quot;in the fairway&quot; or take his chances that he might &quot;drive out of bounds?&quot;  It's classic risk/reward that we all face in our lives, written eloquently in a well told tale.  The mini-stories within about the conflicted slugger Barry McMartin, the rules- bending Roger Cash, and the protaganist's father Gil Houle are rich and imaginative.  Between the covers, this one is better than Shoeless Joe.<br />[Incidently, I am a big Kinsella fan ever since he flew across the continent to appear at openning day of Pupque Park...a miniature replica of Fenway built by 2 enterprising high school boys in their backyard in Wayland, MA. A great day, Kinsella was the star of this Jimmy Fund event despite appearances by Spaceman Bill Lee and Rich Gedman.  Thanks for coming,WPK!]	2002-01-08

I enjoyed the book for what it is...an extension of interviews with the B-24 crews.  It's a bit heavy on the McGovernism.  Unpardonable, really, not to include a schematic or diagram of the plane itself.  Overall, a great portrait of how miserable WWII was for the combatants.	2002-01-04
