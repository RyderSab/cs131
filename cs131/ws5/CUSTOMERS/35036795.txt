I'm not too keen on DC comics usually but this comic brings things to a new level and totally has brought a new fan to the dc universe. with an amazing beginning and battles between the new versions of the old super heroes, a cloned malfunctioning superman and a cockier robin added to the mix. not too mention all the other phenomenal characters this ones sure to become a classic.	2004-10-24

That sound this book is wonderfully written as all six before it and I believe the best series of books ever. That includes Tolkiens sometimes blurry vision of the lotr. With a heavy heart I read this book and I'd be lying if some moments didn't make me angrier than I've ever been reading a book but that was the arc of the story. Last but not least I do have to say that I enjoyed the surprise ending more than most will.	2004-10-17

As a younger fan of the X-Men I don't understand where these stories lead in terms of the current situations in the series. Especially the New X-Men. Who were they, where did they go? Magneto ran a or the school? Also compared to todays artwork this stuff is chickenscratch. Also the preachiness that runs in the first part is a little over the top and serves against the purpose rather than for it. Good for a history lesson if nothing else but I wouldn't recommend purchasing this.	2004-10-06

His wit and humor add a lot to this sequel that very well may top the first. Also the amount of action in this book and the sheer inventiveness of its' author really competes with the Harry Potter series. Hopefully Stroud will have other trilogy or even single books with other magical creatures that live in this world as the central character. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2004-09-27

The beginning explanation of the plague and the prehistory of the character are so vague that the rest of the book is ruined. Doesn't stand anywhere near books like The Stand or Swan Song.	2004-08-30

I imagine that eventually the characters will become more like they are later and things will follow a similar course of events. This is decently illustrated and this edition just looks very nice overall. Also the story is top notch if the reader can put aside all preconceptions on what the x-men are supposed to be. With characters being introduced in entirely new ways and in completely different order, this \\"universe\\" of the x-men is sure to unfold nicely.	2004-08-26

After forcing my way through this somewhat exhausting beginning I arrived at the main part of the story and was very quickly addicted to reading this book. Martel's fascinating description of the the human vs. animal vs. nature conflicts that develop are superbly written and with the conversation at the end the reader deeply questions all. Hopefully I'm not saying too much so we'll just leave it at that. If you can force your way through the beginning prepare to be very pleasantly surprised.	2004-08-24

That said the storyline and art are extremely solid in this collection. good to round out the collection.	2004-08-21

That makes this book to me absolutely fascinating because it asks the question of when do reality and fiction end and become one. What if we're a part of somebody elses story and never realizes it. Overall though I'm frustrated with the ending immensely. Does Jake, Callahan and Oy die? What the hell is happening with Roland and Eddie and which of them will die and most importantly what will become of susannah now? Hurry up next part.	2004-06-13
US	35036795	R1TPBLVM2FDCWL	0671741039	907356964	Swan Song	Books	5	2	5	N	N	A page turner	This book starts out great and ends great and leaves you with a feeling of wanting to remain with the characters despite the life that they face. McCammon masterfully creates characters that you feel for, both good and evil alike. What makes you feel for them is that despite their innate predisposition towards either the light or dark side of humanity you still catch glimpses of who the character could have become if things in their lives had went differently, shown especially through the salvation of Sheila. I would recommend this book highly to anyone who liked the stand, despite other people saying it's a ripoff. The Stand was a disease these are nukes. Also it's hard to right a doomsday horror novel and not compare it to the stand.	2004-06-08

Length isn't always important with \\"great\\" literature, I mean look at The Old Man and the Sea, or possibly the Cat in the Hat, both important pieces of lit (in different ways) but both are very short. So what's the difference. How about a complete development of characters, getting your moneys worth etc. If this book had been of a respectable length it would probably be recieving a five today, alas.	2004-05-05

My biggest problem with this book is that I feel that it wasn't a closed chapter and it left me wanting more. I know that the family could technically carry on forever but the ending that he gave it is a little too fairytail for me. but overall a hugely entertaining read and a new favorite of mine.	2004-04-28

This isn't the usual type of book I read but the author managed to make it interesting to me. One of the problems though is the sheer amount of characters and people that are involved with this story so at points the reader may almost feel overwhelmed by all these characters.

Sometimes it almost seems like he's trying to teach some sort of life lesson through the story (Riding the Bullet) other times he's just trying to scare the hell out of you (Autopsy Room Four) not to mention just to hack and slash his way to glory (Lunch at Gotham). These elements are what make his novels great but shown separately in his short stories they really show that Mr. King is an extremely diverse and multi-faceted author.	2004-03-18

Okay for all of you people who didn't like this book you clearly are just not people who like actual literature you just wait until the novel comes on paperback and pick it up while you're in the line in the grocery store. For the rest of you this story chilled me to the bone and brought me close to tears more than once. In this story you are introduced to Trish who wanders away from her mother while on a hike and becomes lost in the Maine woods. This may sound simple but as the story unfolds you are pulled into the mind of this very young and terrified girl, especially if you have ever been lost in the woods yourself. Every aspect of the woods begins to frighten her and as she becomes more lost, sick and terrified your emotions mount with them, making this an incredibly hard book to put down and an even harder one to forget about.	2003-07-20

It doesn't hide anything like some books try to do, assuming that the kid doesn't have a grip on reality.
