This book rates college on academic as well as social factors so you can see if you fit in to that campus. You can read about dorms, party atmosphere, and what current students are like.

This book does a good job a telling what happened in post war Germany through a child's eyes... even though the interviewees are now senior citizens.<br />The extreme hardships and moral dilemmas that faced women and children in an occupied country come to life. The book does an excellent job of illustrating how often women and children become the victims of war. Starvation, begging and rape, become daily events in the lives of once comfortable middle and working class children.<br />The difference between the kindness of the Americans soldiers and the often cruelty of the Russian forces is a major point.  A shortcoming of the book is that no mention (in the narrative) is made of how most Russian soldiers probably came from villages that had been destroyed by Nazi forces (not that this justified their cruelty, but helps to explain it.)  Several other books I have read explained how Russian soldiers entering Prussia were shocked at the apparent prosperity of Germany and wondered how they could be so greedy to take over less prosperous Russian land.<br />The book is well written and worth a read.	2004-04-04

The author has nothing to hide (like Speer may have) and it is an incredible experience to read first hand what it was like being with Hitler socially and in the final days before his suicide.<br />In most books about Hitler seems to be almost an inhuman supernatural monster.  In this book he is shown more as an egomaniac surrounded by people who are ineffective at advising him.  His coolness and evil are even more chilling when his portrait is fully drawn and he is not simple an evil caricature as in many biographies.<br />The author shares how she was drawn in by Hitler and later felt betrayed.<br />So many books about the Nazi rehash the same facts without a personal perspective.  The author had lunch and dinner with Hitler almost every day for a year!<br />This is a must read for anyone interested in this period of history.	2004-03-22

BUT after reading the entire book I do not think he makes a clear case for Dresden being an over hyped propaganda that showed Nazi as victims.  The book's underlying theme seems to be that the German victims deserved their fate.  Mr. Taylor needs to remember that innocent children also burned in these firestorms.<br />After reading this book the questions remains \\"Why was Dresden chosen as a target?\\"  <br />It seems to bother Mr. Taylor that when one hears the word \\"Dresden\\" one often thinks of the senselessness of war.  That to me is the one positive outcome of the bombing.	2004-03-15
