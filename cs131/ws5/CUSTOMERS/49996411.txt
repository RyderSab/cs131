US	49996411	R1UJ9OPZHPG6NG	0449213013	750649906	Earth Abides	Books	1	18	41	N	Y	Apparently in the minority	As I write this, negative reviews of this novel (one or two star reviews) are few and far between. However, I am compelled to join the minority. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone. Maybe one needs to be an aficionado of the \\"End-of-the-World\\" genre to appreciate this book, but I found it to be contrived and unrealistic. The idea that most of the population would die off due to disease, but that the book's protagonist would choose to tool around the countryside calmly musing on a variety of generally immaterial and irrelevant matters seems absurd. Also, for quite awhile, he manages to encounter ONLY unsavory or potentially dangerous fellow survivors. The entire un-dramatic tone of the book seems way out of proportion with the incredible tragedy that has befallen the earth.   <br /> <br />I very, very rarely leave a book unfinished, and will usually force myself to complete any book I start. But, as they say, \\"too many books, too little time\\". I could not see giving up valuable reading time on a book that offers so very little to the reader, so eventually put this book aside. For me this is the most gravely negative review I could give a book.	2005-09-15

Actually, that's not exactly accurate... the award I truly don't get but I suppose I can understand some of the very positive reviews, since there are aspects of this novel that undoubtedly would appeal to some readers. Shirley Hazzard is unquestionably a talented writer who can string together beautiful prose, especially as she puts you in the setting. But for me, that seems to be all she was interested in here. The story line goes basically nowhere, although I've read and liked novels in the past that don't necessarily have strong story lines. But those novels had engaging, real-life characters in circumstances that are easily related to. I didn't find that here at all - two of the main players (Aldred Leith and Peter Exley), aside from being almost undistinguishable from one another, were just plain boring. <br /> <br />But what annoyed me most of all was the dialogue. Does anyone else know anybody who speaks to one another like these characters? People just don't talk to one another like the characters in this book... especially the Driscoll children, Ben and Helen. There are so many good books to choose from out there, that I'd have to advise against spending time on this one. (Two books I would highly recommend would be Daniel Mason's \\"The Piano Tuner\\" and Tim Winton's \\"Dirt Music\\" - oh, and most anything by Jim Crace.) <br />	2004-08-20

And often I get the same response... &quot;I've never read any Stegner&quot; or even &quot;I don't know the name&quot;. Stegner seems to be one of American literatures best kept secrets.<br />These stories are an excellent introduction to Stegner, his style, and his ability to write vividly about life.

It requires a quiet setting, no distractions, and your close attention. As is often the case with what I would call \\"intellectual fiction\\", the plot is not all that complicated. Moses Herzog, twice divorced, is coming to grips with the dissolution of his second marriage, wherein his wife has taken up with his best friend.<br />What is complicated is Saul Bellow's trip deep into the psyche of his protagonist. Herzog is on the edge of a mental breakdown, and as one way of working through things he write notes and letters to colleagues, friends, celebrities, etc. Sometimes the notes are written out, and sometimes just done mentally; there is no intent to send them. These notes and letters (although admittedly central to the story and to Herzog's character) also serve as a showcase for Bellow's own intellectual acuity, a notion I could never quite put aside. The notion that Bellow was, to put it plainly, \\"showing off\\". All and all, though, this really is a challenging read and one that will give you a good idea of Bellow's style.	2003-05-27

It is a fairly standard story at its heart - the inhabitants of the Forest Kingdom battle (and battle and battle) as they and their land are being engulfed by the Darkwood (your typical light against the dark, good versus evil shtick). The \\"light against the dark\\" theme is used quite regularly in the fantasy genre and is okay in the hands of a good story-teller who can put a twist of originality on the tale, but I don't think Simon Green achieves that here at all. In fact this story is just overstuffed with an unrelenting and forced melodrama. Also, for all of its gory demon-slaughtering the author chooses an otherwise incongruously light-hearted approach to the story. The dialogue is sappy and syrupy to the point of annoyance. I find it hard to believe that most sci-fantasy veterans would find it very rewarding.	2003-04-22

But above all, it is Marquez's prose that wins the day (at least for me). To write with such wit and charm, with such grace and style... Wow! I found myself rereading sentences just for the pure pleasure of their construction. While this is not, as some have said, a &quot;page turner&quot;, that is its strength. This is a novel to be savored, to be devoured by sipping not gulping.  A wonderful and beautiful reading experience.	2003-03-14

And often I get the same response... \\"I've never read any Stegner\\" or even \\"I don't know the name\\". Stegner seems to be one of American literatures best kept secrets.<br />This book won the National Book Award in 1977. It's about Joe Allston, a retired literary agent, who lives with his wife in California. He is 69 years old and looking back at his life with a sense of discontent. He and his wife relive a trip they took to Denmark 20 years before, by reading a journal that Joe kept while they were there. The plot line switches back and forth from the present to the past.<br />This book is about the choices we make in our lives and how they affect everything that comes after. It's about aging and death, and foremost about life. Stegner writes about real life in such intimate terms that it makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck (at least it does that to me). Needless to say, a very highly recommended read.	2003-03-13

The factual basis for this story is the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1529 led by Suleiman the Magnificent. But Powers takes that historical event and blends in Merlin, King Arthur, an ancient brewery, his own reluctant hero Brian Duffy, and an amazing cast of characters to create a unique and superb fantasy. This is just great stuff. Wait until it becomes obvious where the title of the book comes from... I would have never guessed. Very highly recommended.	2003-01-26

He deems himself the intellectual master of nearly all those with whom he comes in contact. He has no job as the story commences, but is coerced into finding work by his fed-up mother. The zaniness that follows can only be appreciated first-hand, so further attempt at a depiction of the plot line is neither necessary nor actually possible.<br />John Kennedy Toole demonstrates a touch of genius in this indescribable satire, a genius that never got a chance to flower, as he was already dead when this book was published. His social commentary, although almost always hilarious, carries an undercurrent of despair. The multiple sub-plots and the incredible cast of characters give this novel such a rich and layered texture that a re-reading (or two or three) is almost a must. Truly one of the most unique books I've ever read.	2003-01-02

He seems unable to move forward with his new life nor to completely let go of his desire to be a successful painter. He bounces around Italy trying to find himself (or maybe lose himself) but never seems to accomplish either.

US	49996411	RA6I1IAJTBZ7H	0684801051	607441444	Time and Again	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Unique time traveling	This is an exceptionally fine novel. It is a &quot;time travel&quot; novel (nothing like any you have read before); it is an historical novel in many ways (in its portrayal of late 19th century New York); it is a mystery; and it is a love story. But what makes this book so engaging are the characters that inhabit both present and past. They are vivid and authentic and easily related to, even those from a completely different era (actually, particularly those from the different era). The plotting is very well paced, and although in another author's hands it could have been complicated, Finney does a superb job of laying the foundation for each succeeding chapter. A highly recommended read.	2002-12-05

In the city-state of Xylar, they pick the next king by whoever catches the beheaded head of the previous king. Jorian, the current king as the story begins, has other ideas. He makes a pact with a wizard to help him escape the beheading. In return, he agrees to help the wizard retrieve a collection of sorcerer's manuscripts held in the Goblin Tower. And the adventure begins. This book is an all-in-one combo of three books of a trilogy consisting of: The Goblin Tower, The Clocks of Iraz, and The Unbeheaded King. It is tongue-in-cheek, fairly lightweight stuff. It's amusing, and at times the adventures are fairly interesting. But, I have to say, I've read the first book - The Goblin Tower - but have little desire, at least at this point, to continue on. I may yet read the others in the hope that it gets more interesting, but I expect it continues as a series of mini-adventures requiring the dashing and daring Jorian to display his many skills. There is little going on here to distinguish it from dozens, or even hundreds, of similar fantasy adventures out there. Not bad, but certainly not special.	2002-11-02

Hall, but I did. I was a huge Travis McGee fan and, although Hall's Thorn character is quite different from John D. McDonald's wonderful knight-errant, it was great to return to south Florida for a terrific story. Thorn is a much more gritty character than McGee, and Hall's writing style is also grittier. Thorn is a hermit-like eccentric with a troubled past who earns a living in the Florida Keys making bonefish lures. He winds up in the middle of a mystery that he decides to resolve himself. Hall describes his setting beautifully and fills his version of the Keys with some odd and quirky characters. All of his characters, even the minor ones, are rich and well fleshed out. The story flows smoothly and the pages fly by. I'm looking forward to reading all of Hall's mysteries, especially those featuring the Thorn character. Very highly recommended.	2002-09-11

But geez, I wanted to like it a whole lot more than I did. I loved the concept - a series of books about Vlad Taltos, an assassin on the world of Dragaera. Vlad is an \\"easterner\\", or human, who is a member of one of the Dragaeran \\"Houses\\" - the Jhereg. Each of the succeeding books is titled with one of the other \\"Houses\\" and presumably is a more in depth look at that \\"House\\".<br />Sounds great (and it wasn't bad as I said), but I find Brust's style lacking in some of the elements I enjoy most. So far I've read two Brust novels (this one and To Reign in Hell) and I find that he puts all his energies into two things - an elaborate plot resolution and, most importantly, snappy dialogue repartee; LOTS of snappy repartee. I found myself begging for a description of almost anything - his wife, his assistant, his office, his apartment, Castle Black - anything. Most of his descriptions are reserved for his knives and daggers. He also creates some very intriguing characters, but leaves them largely with little descriptive meat on their bones. So, while I'll probably read more novels in this series, I'm in no rush to do so.	2002-09-11

It describes the experiences of two French priests (Father Latour - the bishop, and Father Vallaint - his vicar) sent there to establish a diocese. Most of their congregation are Mexicans who have previously been served by the Spanish catholic church, and Native American tribes - some of whom have embraced this new religion but many who have not. The plot line consists mainly of a series of vignettes describing the life of the two priests as they go about their work.<br />Willa Cather writes in a simple, but graceful style much like the personalities of her two priests. It is worth reading this novel just for her descriptions of the austere beauty of the American southwest. Many great authors have an uncanny ability to write beautiful prose with what appears to be very straightforward language, and Willa Cather certainly fits that category. Some have complained that her characters lacked depth in this novel, and though at times they seem to take a back seat to the setting, I found both men to be rich, real, and well-fleshed out characters. A recommended read.	2002-09-06

In this novel Steinbeck atypically writes about life in a town in the east, one somewhere on the lower New England coast. The depth of the characters, a Steinbeck trademark, is present here in spades. His protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, is one of the most thoroughly well written characters that you can find. His wife Mary, his boss Marullo, his friend at the bank next store Joey-boy, his wife's friend Margie Young-Hunt, his kids (maybe especially his kids)... are all so vividly displayed that it's easy to forget that this is a fictitious town filled with fictitious people. The subject matter easily matches the character's depth... the difficulty in a modern world, full of all kinds of pressures, to remain moral and honest in the face of an easier way out. (Although written in the early 60s, the relevance to current headlines is obvious). Suffice to say that Steinbeck is one of the great writers of all time and all his copious skills are on display here. Very highly recommended.	2002-08-19

This is the story of two young cowboys (circa the early 1950s) who head off on horseback into Mexico from there homes in southern Texas. It is, however, no joy ride. The rich, vibrant tapestry of the landscapes painted by McCarthy form the backdrop to the tale as the two make there way south with no real goal other than to experience what comes there way. My only quibble with the novel is the especially young ages of the two... 16 and 17. Their ability to handle extraordinarily difficult situations with a maturity far exceeding their age is a bit of a stretch. Outside of that, highly recommended.	2002-08-19

I have never seen the Robert Redford movie version of this book, but I can pretty much guess that the Roy Hobbs as portrayed by Redford is nothing like the shallow, rather selfish, self-centered character in the book.<br />The only other Malamud book I had read before this one was \\"The Assistant\\", (a book I enjoyed immensely) and while I enjoyed this book well enough it did fall somewhat short of my expectations. Maybe it was because I was expecting a rags-to-riches hero, or maybe it was because I felt Malamud never got below the surface of nearly all the characters...<br />However, the story of the baseball season that the book does cover is exceptionally good, and whether a fan of the game or not, you will be swept along. And while I can quibble some about plotting and depth, Malamud writes splendidly, in a clean, concise, riveting fashion. A somewhat mixed bag, but recommended still.	2002-08-19

I was so engrossed in the novel that when I finished, I immediately began looking for other sources on the battle, and on the war in general. This novel takes you right into the middle of the battle and into the minds of some of the major historical figures on hand (not the least of which is Robert E. Lee). I was thoroughly engrossed and completely captivated by this rich historical fiction.	2002-07-29

Sam Spade is the prototype for all the hard-boiled detective types that came after, and a debt of gratitude is owed to Dashiell Hamett for just about inventing the genre. Contrary to some recent reviews, I think the book stands easily on its own without a need to compare it to the movie. In fact, I'd say the movie owes its success to the pace and atmosphere created in the book. If you've never seen the movie, you should read the book and then rent the movie. If you have seen the movie, I'll bet you'll really enjoy the book anyway. It's just great fun.	2002-07-10

I can clearly remember the drills in school, during the Cuban missle crisis (hiding under our desks as if that would save us). As I got older I became more and more aware of the consequences of the threat, and wondered what the aftermath of an all out nuclear war would be like. Pat Frank's version gives us a glimpse of how one community, a small town in Florida, deals with life after a nuclear war. He does it in an informed and well paced manner.

I'm generally not a huge fan of urban fantasy (I admit to being more of a 'sword and sorcery' guy), but this is a well-crafted, well-paced, and interesting tale (more accurately &quot;tales&quot;). It is a story within a story, drenched in the local flavor of Cornwall. The plot centers around musician Janey Little and her grandfather, who owns the one and only copy of a unique book that is highly prized by some seedy and power-hungry characters. We follow the tale of Janey and her friends as they try to figure out what is so special about the book, while at the same time we read along with Janey as she reads the book.

Yet, Hemmingway is also considered to be a &quot;love him&quot; or &quot;hate him&quot; type. I tend toward the former, though he isn't one of my personal favorites.<br />The plot of this novel is relatively straightforward. American Robert Jordan, a member of the International Brigades fighting with the Republicans against the Fascists during the Spanish Civil War, is given the task of blowing up a bridge to prevent the Fascists from bringing up reinforcements to repel a Republican offensive. But while the plot is uncomplicated, the depth and breadth of Hemmingway's story telling are not. There are layers and layers of emotion, passion, and personal pain. You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters. The characters are so incredibly real, that you feel as though you could find their names in a history book. For those who have never read Hemmingway, I'd say give it a try.	2002-06-30

I saw Tim Powers name on a Sci-Fantasy web site and decided to give him a try. This is a superb novel, intricately yet smartly plotted and nicely weaved together by a very talented writer. Most of the story takes place in early 19th century London, brought vividly to life by the author. The story contains (among other things) time travelers, sorcerers, werewolves, a maniacal clown,  historical poets Lord Byron and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, fictional poet William Ashbless, and Brendan Doyle - our time-traveling hero from 1983.

This book filled that gap splendidly, particularly insofar as the Oglala Sioux are concerned. Ian Frazier is a wonderful author. His easy to read, conversational style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. Like McPhee, he has researched his topic thoroughly. His time spent on the Pine Ridge reservation and his intimate friendship with several tribal members allows the reader to experience a perspective that few writers could achieve. He lays out his topic in unvarnished terms. Native Americans face an extraordinarily unique set of problems to which no other ethnic group can lay claim. The picture can be dark and somber, but Frazier also manages to instill a sense of history, nobility and pride that can cut through the gloom. He conveys his fascination with the Sioux people and their struggle in an infectious and involving manner. Very highly recommended.	2002-05-18

If you have never treated yourself to one of his books, why wait any longer? If you've read, say, &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; and wonder if his other works measure up, don't worry... they do. In this one, he tells the story of the itinerant Mason family over the course of 30 years, from just after the turn of the century until the early 1930s. You'll follow them from the Dakotas to Saskatchewan to Montana, Nevada, and Utah, as Bo Mason, intent on making it big, involves his family in a variety of get rich quick schemes, (some legal, some not) that emotionally wrench the family from one city to the next. They are always on the brink of either great wealth or abject poverty, of high society or a prison term. Stegner can weave a tale like few other writers. Very highly recommended.	2002-05-07

His mastery of the language is unparalleled and his sentence structures, although at times dense, as often approach pure poetry. This is even more astounding given the fact that English is a second language for him. This is the story of an untested young English sailor, Jim, who has visualized himself as a man honor and bravery. When he fails miserably at the very first test of his courage, it alters all aspects of his life and his views of himself. Conrad takes us through an intricate retelling of his tale, from the point of his failure forward, through a third party, Marlow - an older sailor who befriends him.	2002-04-14

This was my first exposure to John Irving, and I was very impressed. This story is told on several levels and touches on a plethora of life defining topics. It is funny yet tragic; violent yet tender; at times emotionally simple and at others emotionally complex. It deals with rape, death, and infidelity; it looks at the women's lib movement, at extremism, at writers and writing; and so on. But T. S. Garp, one of fictions most memorable characters, holds it all together. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in great contemporary literature. I'm looking forward to reading more John Irving.	2002-03-23

US	49996411	R9Q8SR3WKDHSF	0451453328	469239951	Song for Arbonne	Books	5	8	8	N	N	First rate	I had heard great things about Guy Gavriel Kay, and this was my first exposure to his work. To say that I was impressed is an unambiguous understatement. This is as good a fantasy novel as any I've read in a long time. He has created a rich and vibrant world brimming with well fleshed-out, interesting characters. The plot is relatively uncomplicated, but smart and extraordinarily well paced. In fact, the pacing is so good that the over used and hackneyed term \\"page turner\\" actually fits just perfectly.<br />The fantasy content of the novel is mostly limited to the creation of a world loosely based on medieval France. Magic is almost non-existent, and there are no trolls, elves, unicorns, etc. The story deals with very human emotions: love, loyalty, honor, duty etc., but also with jealousy, hatred, bigotry, and more. It is also an excellent political thriller with plenty of plot twists and turns. All in all, I could recommend this book to anyone, whether you are a veteran reader of fantasy novels, or a novice to the genre.	2002-03-11

Achebe does a superb job of appearing to remain outside the story while infusing it with deep sense of tradition and weaving a rich cultural tapestry. The characters created by Achebe to populate the villages of the Ibo people are so thoroughly well done that it seems he is relating an historical, rather than allegorical, tale. The story is seen through the eyes of Okonkwo, a proud and powerful figure in his village. His life unfolds as a parallel to the life of the Ibo people as a whole. A magnificent novel, beautifully yet simply written. Highly recommended.	2002-02-25

Don't get me wrong; I enjoy Martin et al., but this clean, relatively simple, well-paced story was a delight to read. The themes will be familiar: Law against Chaos, a seemingly everyday-guy-type hero, an unlikely little band on a quest, etc. But this book was published in 1953 before those themes were beaten to death, and it still sounds fresh. Poul Anderson is a master story-teller. It is not hard to appreciate why he was so prolific and successful as a writer in both the fantasy and sci-fi genres. Give this one a try.	2002-02-21

Stephen E. Ambrose does an exceptional job of making you feel as though you are along on the expedition with Lewis and Clark. Intimacy and detail are merged with adventure and suspense to craft an incredible sense of &quot;being there&quot;. After reading this book I developed a keen interest in the Native American tribes that he encountered, which led to an avid interest in Native American history in general. That journey has been extraordinary, and it is the mark of superb teacher (ultimately that is what Ambrose is) that he or she opens doorways to further knowledge.	2002-02-04

The original Chronicles of Amber (the first five books - all of Corwin's adventures) is immense fun; it combines a likeable and imperfect hero, humor, intrigue, superb battles, plot twists, exceptional writing, and a great cast of characters. This is a must read for anyone interested in the fantasy genre. As has been affirmed by many reviewers, the second set of five books doesn't measure up to the first, but it's still enjoyable enough.	2002-02-04

For virtually the first half of the book it was all \\"urban\\" and almost no \\"fantasy\\". That would be tolerable if it was interesting and/or well paced. Instead it was plodding and pedestrian. What we get is a not especially engaging look at what goes into the making of a rock-n-roll band; the band members, the equipment, the practices, the \\"gigs\\", etc. Were I a musician I may have found it more palatable, but I'm not. I cringed every time the author referred to a guitar as an \\"axe\\". In fact the author did play in a rock band, and this was her vehicle to blend her fantasy writing with her rock band experience.<br />That leads us to the fantasy. What saved this book from being a total loss was the Phouka, a witty, charming, and flamboyant character. Most of the rest of the fantasy characters (not to mention the mortal characters), and their troubles, failed to connect with me in any way. The plot revolves around a war in Faerie land, with good guys and bad guys that were fairly indistinguishable. I couldn't have cared less about the outcome, although it was never in doubt. The resolution of the conflict also irritated me. (Wow... I liked this book even less than I realized). So I give one star for the effort, and one for the Phouka.	2002-02-01

I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of books I've started but not finished. It's just not something I do. However, I quit on this book about half-way through. Some of the reasons were the author's fault; no doubt some were mine. I don't know that I was fully prepared for what this book ultimately is... a deep, drenching immersion into philosophy, metaphysics, quality of life, and personal self-worth. Writing about those things is a fine and admirable endeavor, but for me reading Pirsig's tortuous and complex prose just didn't work a majority of the time. He would sporadically grab me with a particular line of thought, only to veer off and lose me (interest-wise) for pages on end. I was far more attentive to the cross-country motorcycle trip than I was to his meandering &quot;Chautauqua&quot;. In the end what made me put this book down was that I just wasn't interested enough in the subject matter. So, before you begin this book be sure of what you've undertaken.	2002-01-20

Donleavy is a major literary talent, and it was certainly on display in this book. However, I read an old 1965 paperback addition, and it was hard not to read the reviews on the cover. I was looking forward to loving to hate Sebastian Dangerfield (the book's main character) as he romped his way through Dublin and London. I was even willing to unwillingly like the guy. But in fact I got neither . I didn't much care one way or the other what happened to him, though I suppose that is a reaction too. One review called the book &quot;lusty&quot; - that was true, &quot;violent&quot; - a little, and &quot;wildly funny&quot; - for me this one was way wide of the mark. Another review called it &quot;a wild and unpredictable outburst&quot; - it was pretty wild, but it wasn't overly unpredictable, and &quot;powerful and original&quot; - that was accurate. In the end I was not sorry I read the book, but I didn't love it.	2002-01-06

This book, which is only 118 pages long, briefly depicts much of what she learned first-hand of Sioux customs and rituals. She writes with great intimacy, love, and a depth of knowledge that few could match. Her prose sometimes meanders, and often gives the sense of being unstructured, without a coherent thread. This might bother some and not others. Admittedly, it bothered me at times, as I prefer my facts and history presented in a more cohesive context. That said, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in Native American history.	2001-12-01

I was certain, in the first 100 or so pages of this book, that I was going to hate it. I nearly gave up on it a half-dozen times. James' thick, sometimes impenetrable prose took a great deal of getting used to; in fact I never really did get completely used to it. However, much to my surprise, I wound up engrossed in this novel. I must admit that the very same writing style that had me talking to myself at first, drew me in to the story at a level I hadn't previously experienced. The plot is fairly uncomplicated on the surface (it has been explained sufficiently elsewhere in these reviews), but the depth to which James' characters respond to their situation is anything but uncomplicated. So, if you are looking for a literary challenge, one that will reward you if you stick with it, this is a good choice. If, however, you're looking for a light, easy read... this ain't it.	2001-11-23

It was a very clever idea and Brust pulls off this fantasy version of the Revolt in Heaven with some wit and charm. But it isn't a major work of fantasy by any stretch.

I had read all the great reviews, and have read a great deal of Native American history. Black Elk's first-hand accounts of some of the most famous moments in American history are priceless, as was his description of Sioux culture; these easily rated five stars. But lengthy chunks of this book are descriptions of Black Elk's dream-like visions. They were obviously very personal, and Black Elk even wonders if he should try to recreate them for auhtor John Neihardt. For me, the re-telling of these visions through an interpreter and then written by a white man left the passages a convoluted and overly-detailed morass. I would, however, still recommend that anyone interested in Native American history read this book.	2001-09-08

It is a masterfully written story about an ex-baseball player (Francis Phelan) who has essentailly chosen (for reasons he is trying hard to understand) to become a bum. The location (Albany) and the era (the Depression year of 1938) are so vividly depicted that you are transported in time. The characterizations are extraordinarily sharp, and the tale is timeless.

The feeling is one of &quot;I need to check in on Croft and Brown, Goldstein and Martinez and see what they're up to&quot;, as if their lives continue in a south Pacific jungle somewhere. The book takes place on a fictional island in the Pacific during World War II, but the interaction of the characters and their personal struggles are timeless. This book is considered by many to be the best novel to come out of the war, and it is easy to see why. It's a great novel period, war or not. Highly recommended.	2001-08-29

This often occurs with authors whose style requires a concerted effort to follow, and Conrad certainly fills that bill here. He is a brilliant writer, but anyone used to Grisham et al. will likely not find this an enjoyable read.<br />I did not mind re-reading a paragraph here and there to make sure I had the gist of the passage. I greatly admired the depth and fullness of his characters, and his messages were clear and well-received. My only problem was that the plot line (which when written may have had a shocking impact) is diminished significantly in our era of nearly everyday terrorism. That is no fault of Conrad's to be sure, but timelessness is one of the marks of truly great literature. It is an element obviously missing in this case.	2001-07-15

He also has a somewhat pretentious writing style, which is also accentuated by the repetitive themes. He really doesn't have much to say that isn't basically mean spirited.
