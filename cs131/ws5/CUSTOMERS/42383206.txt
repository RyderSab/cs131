Reading level is about fourth grade, great graphics, text is engaging and stories are short.

Books are reviewed in detail, with clear and painfully precise reasons why they are NOT recommended (e.g. some of Scholastic's I AM AMERICA books are tagged as pretty reprehensible). Then Slapin and Seale target holidays like Thanksgiving and Columbus Day, which will really unnerve teachers who have never given a thought to these \\"days of national mourning\\" from the Native point of view. If you are ready to discard your White Bread America solopsism, this is the book to rip off the blinders. Also read their newest title, BROKEN FLUTE, from Altamira Press.	2005-01-14

And because readers love to match wits with him, this series will endure for many more years, it is certain. Teachers can bedevil their students by reading a mystery each morning (they take about a minute each) and then letting the class try to solve it before the end of the day. When I did this, I had to hide the book in the trunk of my car because the kids were desperate to figure out the answer. Delightfully innocent, wonderfully tricky, all ages will love these quick vignettes with answers at the back of the book. Would also be good to use with seniors!	2004-02-16
