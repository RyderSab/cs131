It  was fun to read with a clever and funny older main character and I'm  looking forward to the others in the series.	2000-09-04

It is still an engaging  book, particularly once past the initial set-up of character introduction,  politics, etc. The pace rockets along once on the fire scene itself. The  difference in the books may also be due to the different time settings of  the two books. 1949 was the beginnings of organized fire control and  fighting and a much simpler time. With the enormous increase in population  and the complexity of agencies available to fight the fires, John had many  more facts, bueracracies and personalities to deal with. Perhaps his style  of newspaper reportage suits more contemporary times; facts and speed of  delivery being most important.	2000-08-16

There are no speeding car chases  or really tense moments, but I was drawn along by the puzzle and Faherty  writes well. I will definately read the others in the series.	2000-03-13

And ending up not being able to put it down. It has become one of the few non-fiction titles on my lifetime favorites list. It's  particularly fun when you encounter someone else who has read it (my  veterinarian!) and also loved it. A great book.	1999-11-15

But this book is a true oddity. It begins slow, becomes more interesting in the second half and then peters out; the  momentum doesn't carry through. The dialogue is close to indecipherable and  makes for very slow going. The concept of the relationship between the two  major characters is interesting, which is why I gave it 3 and not 2 stars.	1999-09-30
US	52797715	R2SP3QH7WM703H	0553111531	306714600	Darkness Peering	Books	3	0	5	N	N	Average thriller	This author won an award for her short stories; they must be better than this somewhat lame and poorly thought out suspense novel. As other readers have said, the romance adds nothing to the plot or character development  and is therefore pointless. The writing style is psuedo-arty but kind of  annoying generally. I don't think a comparison to Thomas Harris is deserved  because there is nothing exceptonal here (except the occasionally awkward  prose style).	1999-09-17

I listened to the unabridged recording of HOSTILE WITNESS read by one of my favorite readers, Richard Ferrone.

But SOME DEATHS...reads as if written by some fussy, silly old British upper middle  class woman who hasn't had any outside communication since 1959. The pace  is deadly slow and just dull at times as the narrative winds forward and  back in time and from one annoying character after another. Between  daughter Flora nattering on and on to saintly nurse Dilys and stiff-upper  dead Jocelyn, not one character has any originality or life. This is a very  disappointing book when compared with TEFUGA or A PERFECT GALLOWS. Read the  earlier novels to understand was an excellent writer Mr. Dickinson really  is.	1999-07-01

I have been reading the Discworld series for the last couple of years and have about 8 more to go before I am caught up. In spite of the 2 plotlines that are very divergent, I enjoyed the book ENORMOUSLY and even though I  may have missed some of the ECKSECKSECKSian references, I still found it an  entertaining and clever read.

Some of the dialogue is a little awkward and the main characters not developed enough but the pace is  exciting most of the time. There are enough villians to satisfy anyones  requirements and the heroes are likable (although I preferred Tony Lowell  to Lena Bedrosian). I plan on eventually reading the others in the series.	1999-04-30

It was a good read (entertaining, well-paced, kept my attention) and fun, in spite of some of the business philosophy stuff. The  biographies are fascinating (Milton Hershey in particular) as are the  candy/chocolate development stories. Five stars from a non-business person.	1999-02-13

The fictional part of the book is kind of dull and the  defense lawyer character is stupifyingly dumb when it comes to the opposite  sex, making it difficult to believe he can handle the seriousness of his  client's problems. The final payoff/twist in the plot is sketchy at best  and not very satsifying after a long wait.	1999-02-08

HOGFATHER is one of the best so far. Laugh-out-loud funny, clever, charming, etc.,etc. Now both my  husband and I are both hooked.

The books and characters have  become almost legendary and after reading FIRST EAGLE, decided to see if my  impression of the quality of his earlier writings was as captivating as I  remembered. I picked up the unabridged audiotape and have been in listening  heaven for the last few days. What a treat! Hillerman's style has changed a  bit - Leaphorn and Chee have both become more verbose - but the essentials  that have made his books so readable are still present. May there be many  more!	1998-08-25

Turning a lyrical phrase effectively in a piece of prose is  a skill not every writer can muster. Such is the case here. Aside from the  lack of a compelling plot (how long did it take you to figure out our boy  was dating a relative? - certainly a lot sooner than he did)Morrow doesn't  know when to turn off the stylist in himself. I once heard a critic call  Robert James Waller's writing style &quot;gaseous&quot;. That critic  obviously hasn't opened this book. I'll go one step further and call  Morrow's style gastric (as in distress).	1998-08-25

The premise of the novel, that the loss of insect life causes the end of &quot;civilization as we know it&quot; is credibly advanced and researched: the author's case is made. And the details of the crumbling social structure are logical and readably presented. But....this book is REALLY depressing. Not because of the possiblity of this being the fate of the earth, but because the story is so relentlessly glum. We become acquainted with characters, get to know them, good and bad, and inevitably, all are wiped out in terrible ways. Sometimes the author lets his characters get this close to being saved before he lowers the axe, just to prove he can keep you turning the pages.  Survivors are not allowed, even though their story would have been interesting. I can't see myself picking up another Charles Pelligrino, ever.	1998-03-27
