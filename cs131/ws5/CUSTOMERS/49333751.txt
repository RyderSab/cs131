At least he plays fair with the reader, admitting off the top that he might be predisposed to looking for suicidal tendencies in his subject.  But the reader should also take this as a warning: this is not a fan's-eye-view of Nirvana's chart-topping success (Dave Grohl makes brief and scattered appearances throughout the book), but a gloves-off biography of their tortured leader.  Read in that light, it is mostly a success.  Mostly.<br />Cross' greatest strength is the depth and breadth of his research.  Apparently Courtney Love, Kurt's widow, gave Cross extensive access to Kurt's personal effects.  She also sat for repeated lengthy interviews, as did many of the other notable players in Kurt's life.  This kind of access gives Cross an insight into his subject that those of us who read all the Rolling Stone and Spin Magazine profiles of the man never got.  It's revelatory, to be sure.  For example, he is able to quote liberally from Kurt's diary, which lets the reader into Kurt's head.  It offers such revelations as the following, which describes his concession to the inevitable path of becoming a junkie: &quot;if I feel like a junkie as it is [due to stomach pains], I may as well be one.&quot;  Or, in Cross' greatest discovery, he describes a long lost video of Kurt bathing his daughter Frances, in a scene of seemingly domestic tranquility.  The camera focuses on father and daughter for a long moment, and then abruptly pans around the bathroom.  Cross, an observant viewer, notes that in the toothbrush holder, instead of a toothbrush, is a syringe.  His commentary on this image, how it destroys the conventional familial image established moments before, is some of his best work.<br />Sometimes, however, Cross can go a bit overboard with the facts.  Just because he found out a little tidbit like, &quot;[Kurt's] favorite [infant] game was peekaboo, his first tooth appeared at eight months, and his first dozen words were, 'coco, momma, dadda, ball, toast, bye-bye, hi, baby, me, love, hot dog, and kittie,'&quot; doesn't mean it needs to be included.  Too often Cross recounts, in laundry list-like prose, trivial facts like this, which really do very little in terms of illuminating the life.  It comes across more as showing off his knowledge.<br />He also, at times, can't help indulging into a bit of pop psychoanalysis, where pop psychoanalysis is not welcome.  In Cross' hands a picture of the Cobain family, taken when Kurt was 6, supposedly does a precise job of predicting the sorrow to come.  Based exclusively on body language on posture.  The picture is included here for your perusal.  I, for one, didn't see anything near to what Cross saw.  He also, at one point, compares Kurt's image in early band photos to &quot;Christ in Leonardo da Vinci's 'The Last Supper'&quot;.  I suppose one sees what one wants to see.  <br />And anyone who lived through the period, like I did, will find dubious statements such as the following: &quot;'The Cobain baby' was as talked about across lunch counters and supermarket checkout lines as the Lindbergh baby had been decades before.&quot;  The Vanity Fair article that revealed Courtney had used heroin during her pregnancy was big news, true.  But only within the community.  It was not nearly the global tabloid scandal that Cross makes it out to be.  Misleading analysis like the preceding calls into question every other statement Cross has to make.  It does a lot of work undermining his credibility.<br />Further compounding the problem is Cross' hit-or-miss writing.  For the most part he utilizes an objective, almost journalistic prose style, laying the facts at the reader's feet without unnecessary ornamentation.  But every once in a while he will indulge in odd analogies: &quot;Like senior citizens going to a dentists' appointment, the band made sure they were early for this all-important show.&quot;  Was that bit of superfluous style really necessary?  These bits appear out of nowhere in the text, and come off as if the writer had a burst of inspiration, albeit a rather dull one.  Though, even when he's playing things by the book, Cross is still prone to blunders.  He clumsily describes the *melody* of the song &quot;About a Girl&quot; as &quot;sweet, slow, and *melodic*&quot;.<br />Despite the numerous complaints I've outlined above, Cross' book is still consistently readable; although I suspect that the power of the story being told has a lot to do with that.  I've always thought that a biography should be judged on how the author was able to stay out of the way, and let the events of the life present themselves.  In this case, Cross is, like I noted above, mostly a success.  His reputation as a respected music and entertainment journalist is apparently well-earned, despite some missteps along the way, and his objectivity is very rarely questionable.  That being said, his greatest feat, paradoxically, is the way he handles Kurt's final days.  Much of it of course is speculation, for no one but Kurt knows how it all went down.  But what Cross comes up with to tell this part of the tale is moving and powerful, without ever pandering to melodrama.  The final moments are recounted with credibility, pathos, sorrow, and, most importantly, empathy.  The book breaks from being a standard biography at this point, adding untold emotion to these well-written scenes.  Cross even manages to tie up the book's (and, consequently, the life's) main themes.  These final pages do yeomen's work making up for any errors Cross has made along the way, and, ultimately, they make the book a worthwhile read.	2002-09-01
US	49333751	R1IUW1D0EE2DFC	0374129983	647099960	The Corrections	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Not 'The Great American Novel', But Great Nonetheless	Set in St. Jude, a fictional city in, I think, Ohio, but really more of a Midwestern Everycity, \\"The Corrections\\" is the story of the Lambert family.  Father Alfred is slowly fading away, due to the onset of Parkinson's Disease.  Mother Enid wants her family, which also consists of her grown children Gary, Chip, and Denise, to spend one last Christmas in their childhood home.  These are highly intelligent but emotionally scarred people.  These are the Royal Tenenbaums, these are Salinger's Glass family.  As Enid's attempt at a reunion are consistently rebuffed, author Jonathan Franzen presents the reader with a portrait, a dramatic tableau, of each member of the Lambert family, the better to understand why they wouldn't want to come home for Christmas, but probably should anyway.<br />The book is divided up into long chapters, each focusing on one member of the Lambert family.  It would seem to be a simple structure, one that even the most pedestrian reader could follow.  But this belies the complexity within each chapter.  Time, in Franzen's hands, is dynamic, as he jumps liberally back into each character's past, then slowly forward to the present.  He does this with skill and precision, but also without fanfare.  Careful attention must be paid, else a lazy reader will get lost.  This technique allows Franzen to slowly build up the fabric of the Lambert family, as the reader sees patterns emerge within the lives of each character.  It also helps that Franzen allows you inside the characters' heads, to see the world through their eyes, giving their internal dialogues a chance to be heard.  What you see and hear, however, is not always pretty.  Often times, these people -- like, I suspect, most of us -- are quite ugly in their private moments.  You'll see how Alfred's dementia makes his life a confusing place, how oldest son Gary's depression creates in his home life an oppressive hell, how middle child Chip's obsessions and fantasies and masturbatory perversions dotheir best to ruin his promising teaching career, and how youngest child Denise's own confusion and anger conspire to ruin every relationship she has.  Each character's thoughts, as they would themselves think them, are laid bold on the page.  It's an intriguing and credible rhetorical technique that Franzen's skill as a writer pulls off perfectly.<br />Franzen lets his technique show far too often.  Writing that strives to tear apart the seams of literary convention often times bores me.  I prefer it when a writer just comes up with a stronger stitch.  Franzen toes the line between these two tendencies.<br />When writing about Gary and his family, for example, Franzen uses an inordinate amount of exclamation points.  Usually this would indicate a flaw in the author, that his limp prose must rely on punctuation to convey meaning.  But Franzen, in full control of his prose and willing to show his skill at every turn, uses it to indicate something about character: that Gary and family, outwardly successful, are empty and dysfunctional on the inside.  It's a less than subtle technique, though.  At least the other characters wear their dysfunction under their sleeves; Gary's is right there in the punctuation.  Less effective still is Franzen's use of that suddenly-tired modern literary convention, the e-mail conversation.  Chip and Denise's dialogue would have been traded through lengthy, handwritten letters, doing yeomen's work marking the passage of time, if this novel had been written but ten years ago.  Now, they just exchange half-formed thoughts, inside jokes, and not much content.  Maybe that's the point (not maybe; I'd gather that is exactly the point), but it made for unenlightened reading.  Neal Stephenson, in his long crypto-tome \\"Cryptonomicon\\", is the only writer I've encountered so far who has been able to effectively update this technique for the modern age.<br />More effective, however, is the way Franzen recasts familiar situations to suit the inner thoughts of the character they are happening too.  Alfred's battle with overwhelming incontinence is told as if he were planning the safety inspection of a railroad (one of his duties before he retired).  Denise's sexual technique is recounted as if it were a recipe for a particularly complicated dish (she's a cook by trade).  These, and others just like them, are wonderful extended passages, where Franzen ably relates the inner and outer lives of these characters, allowing them to intertwine into one level of existence.<br />The inner lives of his characters are further complicated by his use of an omniscient and often times judgmental third person narrator.  This technique is usually reserved for objective storytelling, presenting the facts as they lay.  But Franzen's authorial voice has an intelligence and awareness all its own.  Witness this little bit about Enid:<br />\\"'There's bacon, you like bacon,' Enid sang.  This was a cynical, expedient fraud, one of her hundred daily conscious failures as a mother.\\"<br />These are the narrator's words (\\"a cynical, expedient fraud\\"), not any one character's.  Never afraid to take a stand, Franzen performs vivisection after vivisection on his unsuspecting creations, the better to understand them inside and out.<br />Has Franzen written the Great American Novel?  It's great, and it surely is American, but applying that three-word adjective to this tome at this point is a little hasty.  I suspect, because it makes specific reference to pop culture icons of its time (Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Aniston, and Chloe Sevigny -- amongst many others -- are all name-checked here), it might not be relevant five or ten years down the road.  Is it a darkly comic vivisection of a modern midwestern family?  It sure is.  Funny and tragic at once, Franzen is able to straddle the line between these two tones with remarkable ease.  His book is truly insightful, mercilessly satiric, and endlessly readable.  Not a book that will change the world, mind you, but still well worth the read.	2002-08-22
US	49333751	R331X5G5PW22PZ	0679731725	247754060	The Remains of the Day	Books	4	14	20	N	N	A Butler Procedural, A Repressed Romance, And . . .	\\"The Remains of the Day\\", Kazuo Ishiguro's 1989 Booker Prize winning novel, is the slim memoir of Stevens, a lifelong British butler, recounting his glory days before the second World War at the infamous Darlington Hall, while on a road trip through the English countryside.  Or at least that is what a cursory read-through would leave the reader believing.  In fact, it is much more than that.  \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is actually three books in one, a fact that I will now elaborate on.<br />Firstly, it is a fine butler procedural.  \\"Surely it is enough that the likes of you and I,\\" Stevens writes to his ideal reader, \\"at least try to make our small contribution count for something true and worthy.\\"  Having attained a high position in one of England's finer homes, he has had the chance to rub shoulders with not only the most important political figures of the day (he's even met Mr. Churchill), but with some of the finest modern butlers.  Men such as Mr. Graham and Mr. Donalds, names that his reader will most assuredly be familiar.  They not only discuss amongst themselves the various butlering trends of the day (e.g. methods of polishing silver; how to remain constantly at their master's service while remaining out of sight), but also the less tangible characteristics of a good butler, such as dignity and loyalty.<br />On the former characteristic, Stevens gives an example from his father's history, as well as his own that illustrate his notions on the subject of dignity.  His example concerns the Conference of March 1923, an attempt by Lord Darlington to retract the Treaty of Versailles.  Already taxed during this busy weekend, Stevens is further inconvenienced when his father, a legendary butler in his own time now working at Darlington Hall during his waning years, falls gravely ill.  During his father's last moments, Stevens never strays from duty, even going so far as to find fresh bandages for the French delegate's feet.  You will agree that a butler, born to serve, must keep his mind on his duties at all times, personal feelings be damned.<br />As to the second characteristic, loyalty, Stevens maintains that, \\"it is... not possible to adopt... a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service.\\"  Thus, he turns a blind eye to the popular opinion that Lord Darlington more hurt than helped England's cause.  Paradoxically, Stevens doesn't advocate loyalty to an employer obviously not deserving of such.  How does one achieve both goals?  It is a question not even a butler of Stevens' caliber can fully answer, although in asking the question one has taken the first step towards enlightenment.<br />Besides being a butler procedural, \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is also a love story.  But not your typical love story, for most of the romance is beneath the surface, hidden from even those involved.  Part of the reason for Stevens' holiday in the country is the desire to be reacquainted with one Miss Kenton, the housekeeper at Darlington Hall during its halcyon days.  She, having just divorced from her husband, may be interested in returning to her former post.  Stevens, never admitting his feelings for Miss Kenton, is excited by this prospect.<br />But why did he not snatch her up when he had the chance?  More apt to do what's good for the house than what's good for himself, Stevens \\"always found such liaisons [two members of the staff deciding to marry one another] a serious threat to the order in a house.\\"  So he represses his feelings.  Much of the memoir's suspense comes from wondering what will happen when Stevens, out of his professional stuffy surroundings, finally meets Miss Kenton again.  I'll not spoil the fun, but will warn the reader to bring along some hankies.  Despite not being a conventional love story, \\"The Remains of the Day\\" succeeds at pulling your heartstrings.<br />Despite the tone I've adopted so far, I suspect a clever reader will have seen through my ruse.  Implications abound above that \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is non-fiction.  Sorry to mislead you, but you see I was trying to make a point.  Just as a reader should not take anything I've said so far at face value, they also should not wholly put their trust in Stevens' words.  For he is, in my opinion, the epitome of the post-modern rhetorical device that I find most fascinating: the unreliable narrator.<br />Stevens thinks he is doing his best to relate the events of his life, and, as a byproduct of this, clear Lord Darlington's name.  But he is too stuffy and too reserved to fully complete his task.  Several moments in the book explicitly point out that he -- intentionally or otherwise -- is hiding the real facts, for they do not support his hypothesis.  When asked by a man helping him with his dry radiator if he, \\"used to work for that Lord Darlington?\\" Stevens implies that he didn't.  Stevens is not able to come up with an answer for why he misled the man, but a perceptive reader will.  Later, after he's spent four pages trying (unsuccessfully) to refute claims of Lord Darlington's anti-Semitism, Stevens realizes he has digressed from what must be the reader's real interest, the trend of meticulous silver polishing.  Unconsciously, he leapt off on a tangent.  When he realized that maybe he was in dangerous territory, he quickly backpedaled.  Very telling.<br />Ishiguro, Japanese born but British bred and educated, captures the prudent voice of the English butler perfectly.  He never falters in his accurate portrayal, to the point where a reader wouldn't be blamed for really thinking this a memoir.  Along with this accuracy comes a story, full of mystery and romance and political intrigue and remorse, that, despite its lack of a propulsive narrative, never ceases to be a page-turner.	2002-08-09
US	49333751	R2Y0CCE8VMG1T7	0140077022	981253911	White Noise (Contemporary American Fiction)	Books	5	8	12	N	N	Diers and Killers	I recently finished Don DeLillo's \\"White Noise\\" for the third time.  The first time, as a high schooler, it seemed like a harsh condemnation of mass media and its effect on our everyday lives.  The second time, as an undergraduate, it seemed like a post-modern meta-fiction, concerned with breaking down the barriers between author, protagonist, and reader.  The third time, as someone recently out of school, it seemed like a well-constructed family drama, only through the eyes of the Gladneys, a rather modern and iconoclastic family.<br />But all three times, with increasing certainty every time I read it, I knew that there was one thing \\"White Noise\\" was really about: death.  For this last read I made a point of noting whenever death is mentioned.  In the first thirty pages alone we have the following:<br />* Page 4: traffic on an expressway outside the Gladney house sounds like, \\"dead souls babbling at the edge of a dream.\\"<br />* Page 6: Babette Gladney, matriarch, says of the rich mothers and fathers dropping their sons and daughters off at the University where her husband works: \\"I have trouble imagining death at that income level.\\"<br />* Page 30:  Jack Gladney, patriarch, sums up his marriage: \\" Babette and I have... spoken deep into the night about... awakenings, old loves, old fears (except fear of death).\\"<br />* Page 15 & 30: The novel's central question is said out loud: \\"Who will die first?\\"<br />It goes on like this throughout the course of the book.  Death is everywhere: in the television set, in the course that Jack teaches, and, most explicitly, in the aftermath of an industrial accident.  The accident unleashes an \\"airborne toxic event\\", to quote the euphemism DeLillo expertly creates, which hangs like a pall over the innocent small town.  It is this sequence, 50 pages that comprise the book's middle third, in which DeLillo's writing really shines.  Like the Polo Grounds scenes from his \\"Underworld\\", DeLillo constructs another wicked set piece.  Thischapter precisely nails the fear, paranoia, and black comic nature of the event.  Everything that comes after is somehow different.<br />In Jack Gladney, DeLillo has created a narrator with a deadpan wit, a capacity for startling self-realization, and an intense fear at his lack of immunity against the world's dangers.  Jack's life work is a course he created in Hitler studies.  It is touches like this that elevate the story told from the realm of reality (would such a thing ever exist in the post-PC age?) to the realm of the hyper-real.  We see it in the way the characters talk (most explicitly in Jack's ultra-verbose children, each wiser beyond his/her years than the last), in the way they live their lives (Babette busies herself by reading tabloid newspapers to the blind elderly), and in the cacophony of noise that surrounds them.<br />This last point gives the novel its name.  For it is the white noise that emanates from the TV set, from the radio, and from the loudspeaker at the supermarket, that hides the fear of death that acts as the novel's powerful subtext.  DeLillo delights in periodically breaking away from the action at hand to quote the white noise.  A conversation between a father and a daughter about the father's inability to hold down a job is suddenly interrupted, apropos of nothing, by: \\"... a British voice [from upstairs, presumably the TV set, which says]: 'There are forms of vertigo that do not include spinning.'\\"  And then the conversation continues as if nothing has happened.  Sometimes these interruptions aren't even audible to the characters in the book.  Only the reader can hear them (such as the scene where Jack ruminates on the look and appearance of a mystery man who may or may not be having an affair with his wife; half a page of paranoid suppositions is concluded by just one Tourettic word: \\"Panasonic\\").  They can be very jarring when first encountered, but once you understand what DeLillo is doing, it makes perfect sense.  Pay attention to the ephemera, for it holds much meaning.  <br />Many of the novel's more flavourful scenes are composed like semantic discussions.  After pondering the effects of a near-aircrash, Jack notes that: \\"Certain elements in the crew had decided to pretend that it was not a crash but a crash landing that was seconds away.  After all, the difference between the two is only one word... How much could one word matter?\\"  A later scene finds him explaining to his wife that a fire captain car sped by their house, a loudspeaker asking people to evacuate after the toxic spill.  Babette, obviously in no mood to leave, counters with, \\"In other words you didn't have an opportunity to notice the subtle edges of intonation.\\"  Was the captain ordering them, or expressing an opinion?  In the Gladney world, such subtle differences matter.  They are the stuff that literally separates life and death.  Most wonderfully is a scene during the evacuation procedure, when Jack realizes that the people in charge are from a company expert in evacuation simulations.  After a conversation with a particularly blase official, Jack asks, \\"Are you saying you saw a chance to use the real event in order to rehearse the simulation?\\"  Semantics rule the day, and inform \\"White Noise\\" at the expense of all else.<br />There's so much more here that I haven't touched on: Jack's colleague Murray and his endless interesting theories; the various relationships between Jack, his multiple ex-wives (who all seem to be involved in the intelligence industry) and their irregularly named offspring (Heinrich, Wilder, etc.); the boy who wants to sit in a cage with deadly snakes for 60 days, to break a record and define himself.  I'll leave that for you to discover like I did.  Of course I can't claim to have discovered everything.  In fact, I can't wait for my fourth read, to further fill in the gaps of this wonderful, multi-layered, and surprisingly funny novel.	2002-07-14
US	49333751	R3SSIBVL577N6T	0679775439	730850906	The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Novel	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Shape Without Form, Shade Without Colour	Haruki Murakami's \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\" is a good combination of the weirdness that turned me off his \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\", and the transcendent beauty that had me gushing over his \\"Norwegian Wood\\".  Thankfully, he's taken what didn't work in the former and made it work, and what did work in the latter and amplified it.<br />Our narrator here, an out of work lawyer named Toru Okada, bears a lot of resemblance to his \\"Norwegian Wood\\" namesake, Toru Watanabe.  Both men are ciphers, devoid of any personality of their own.  \\"No doubt about it: a whole day had gone by,\\" Okada notes at one point.  \\"But my one-day absence was probably not having an effect on anybody.  Not one human being had noticed that I was gone, likely.\\"  This is how both Torus see themselves, only it was hardly true.  Okada, like Watanabe, is adept at unwillingly attracting a menagerie of strange women to him.  There's a pair of seemingly psychic sisters with silly names, an inquisitive and curious high-school girl who lives across the alley, and the mysterious woman who's always offering Okada a cigarette.<br />Most dominant of these women is Okada's wife, Kumiko.  \\"Is it possible, finally, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another?\\" Okada asks early on, articulating the novel's central question.  It is Kumiko of which he is speaking here.  She appears one morning wearing a strange new perfume.  And then she disappears.  The remainder of the book finds Okada searching for her, and the situations he gets himself into do a lot of work in answering his question in the negative.  Take one example, in which he relates the story of how on their first date, Kumiko wanted to watch the jellyfish at the aquarium.  Unfortunately, the jellyfish call up a bad memory for Okada: the time as a boy when he accidentally wandered into a school of jellyfish and got badly stung, making him violently him sick.  The curious thing about this story is that he admits to never telling Kumiko any ofthis.  Through his own actions he misrepresents himself to his wife, while paradoxically proclaiming her to be the one person who understands him.  It is Kumiko herself who metaphorically answers his question, later on in the book, when she notes that, \\"Two-thirds of the earth's surface is ocean, and all we can see of it with the naked eye is the surface: the skin.  We hardly know anything about what's underneath the skin.\\"<br />Mirroring this idea, that we can't ever know another human being, Murakami's book presents itself as a confusing mixture of styles and time periods and points of view.  While writing in a prose style that's comfortable for a reader to flow through, Murakami does a lot of work not letting the audience (nor Okada for that matter) see the machinations that are powering the story.  To a passive reader, this can be quite disconcerting.  The book is filled with tools to keep the reader off-balance: characters often tell long-winded stories, and abruptly cut themselves off in the middle for seemingly no reason; Okada asks countless questions of the people he believes to have the answers but never seems to get any; in fact, his questions are often ignored.<br />But a more discerning reader will revel in Murakami's post-modern detective techniques.  Like Paul Auster's \\"New York Trilogy\\", \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\" is less about finding the answer, than about the labyrinthine path one must go through to even ask the questions.  The story is: \\"A well without water.  A bird that can't fly.  An alley with no exit.  And--\\" as Okada incompletely notes at one point.  He is a narrator most put off balance, but more than willing to follow along on the adventure.  \\"I felt as if I had become part of a badly written novel,\\" he says.  \\"That someone was taking me to task for being utterly unreal.  And perhaps it was true.\\"  He is constantly recognizing that the little universe into which he's stepped has artificial rules.  At times he becomes frustrated with the lack of cohesive explanations (\\"This reminded me of several so-called art films I had seen in college.  Movies like that never explained what was going on.  Explanations were rejected as some kind of evil that could only destroy the films' 'reality'\\") but he never quits on the search.  The audience, in order to enjoy this book, should follow Okada's lead in this regard.  If they don't, Murakami's head games will confuse rather amuse, and annoyance will rule the day.  If you're not ready for a book so aware of its reader that it helpfully title chapters 'No Good News in This Chapter' and 'A Place You Can Figure Out If You Think About It Really, Really Hard', then you're probably not ready for \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\".<br />If you are ready, then you'll encounter 600+ pages (it's long, but not *too* long) of simply but effectively written narrative (Jay Rubin's translation once again captures the tranquility-within-chaos that is a hallmark of Murakami's prose).  One that's set in Japan but bears the cultural marks of American influence.  One that jumps back and forth between the recent past and \\"prewar Manchuria, continental East Asia, and the short war of 1939 in Nomonhan.\\"  You'll encounter an interesting use of parallel motifs, where items or events that occur in the past or in a dream or on TV reveal themselves again in Okada's waking life.  Here's a helpful hint: follow the bat, the dry well, and, of course, the wind-up bird, which \\"comes over by my place every day and goes 'Creeeak' in the neighbor's tree.  But nobody's ever seen it.\\"	2002-07-06
US	49333751	R1XW1KCSQIX0G3	0425167283	430499125	Election	Books	4	14	15	N	N	High School Presidential	The back cover of this edition of \\"Election\\" makes the following claims: Tracy Flick, prospective President of Winwood High, is the kind of girl who \\"edits the yearbook [and] star[s] in the musical\\"; Paul Warren, likable jock, is so dim he's described as \\"not sure what's going on\\"; and the election at the high school is fraught with \\"sex scandals, smear campaigns, and behind-the-scene power brokers\\".  I mention this, because, curiously, none of these things are found in the book.  Oh sure, they could be.  Maybe in the in-between scenes, the one that author Tom Perrotta doesn't actually write, but that's reading a little too much into the book's subtext.  Either that, or an overworked copywriter never read the book, but rented the movie instead.<br />This is one of those rare occasions where the movie is more fleshed-out than the book.  At a scant 200 pages (it can't be more than 40,000 words long; the slowest of readers could polish it off in a couple of hours), I found myself waiting for favourite scenes from the movie to pop up in prose form.  Can you believe that Mr. McAllister doesn't even get stung by a bee in the book?  For shame!  I know, I know, you can't blame Perrotta for any of this; he wrote the book he wrote and he can't change it now for an audience familiar with the story in another medium.  They might be disappointed by the omissions, but I wasn't.<br />While the book rarely gives more than a preliminary expository sketch of its characters, Perrotta is smart enough to allow self-definition through their actions and their speech.  Which any good book should be doing anyway.  Listen to the way these kids talk.  Paul describes his girlfriend Lisa as: \\"sarcastic-looking.\\"  It's a phrase that means nothing, but somehow I can picture her.  A better example is this bit from Tracy, describing a torrid affair with a teacher: \\"We fooled around in the darkroom, the handicapped elevator (this was after school, when the wheelchair kids had gone home), and backstage, behind the curtain.\\"  This is the essence of Tracy's character: she's blunt, politically incorrect (ironic for someone running for class president), and unabashedly cold.  Perrotta, in a style that stays away from overly purple prose, nails the language of the age perfectly.  I suspect that Perrotta knew this was his greatest strength, for the book is told in a series of vignettes, each from a different character's point of view.  The effect is \\"Rashomon\\"-like, as we get alternating viewpoints on situations and character that allows us to question just who is telling the whole truth.<br />In a pivotal scene, an overzealous campaign manager defines the 'base' voters of each candidate.  Paul's support will come from the \\"jocks, cheerleaders, and wannabes.\\"  Tracy can count on \\"the AP crowd, [and] maybe the band.\\"  Tammy Warren, Paul's younger sister and bona fide alternative candidate, will garner most of her votes from \\"the burnouts and the benchwarmers and the kids who feel left out.\\"  Not only does this scene neatly define the election subplot, but also it quickly categorizes what it means to be a high school student: you're athletic and popular, smart and respected, or apathetic and unsympathetic.  It's a pretty bleak school view that Perrotta lays out.  For those of us who remember high school vividly, though, it can't be more accurate.<br />Perrotta's accurate eye is not only trained on the students, but it gets a good look at the teachers too.  Jim McAllister, a.k.a. Mr. M., is our conduit into this little-seen world.  He's a perfect example of the adage, \\"those who can, do; those who can't, teach.\\"  Although that's unfair, for Mr. M is too satisfied to see if he can 'do'.  One moment of anguish has him detailing a dream of his perfect career, only to admit that he'd \\"done nothing to implement [those dreams].\\"  In many ways, Mr. M reads like a typically content but not happy character.  But in other ways, he's rather odd.  Over his decade at the school he'sbuilt himself a prudent reputation, while simultaneously building a solid marriage.  But he dallies from his wife and career in one destructive week, and it changes him from being a respected teacher to a man who would reflexively muse that \\"it's awful to admit, but I felt a powerful sense of relief every time I turned on the TV and saw buildings going up in flames, and that poor man being dragged out of his truck.\\"<br />This last bit, an oblique reference to Los Angeles in the wake of the Rodney King verdict, also highlights the book's insistence on being anchored in a specific time period.  The L.A. Riots, the Thomas/Hill hearings, and the impending election of Governor Clinton into the White House all form an early nineties backdrop that seems to be commenting directly on the events occurring at Winwood High.  \\"The only difference was that Bill and Clarence lied and I told the truth,\\" laments Mr. M., in one of the book's most poignant lines.  The time and place are captured neatly, and relevantly.<br />\\"Election\\" is not a perfect slice-of-life.  It's too short to be considered great, and there are some clunky plot-devices that I didn't buy.  But it's still more than just a trifle.  If you'd told me some prodigy teenager had handed this work in for a creative writing assignment, I'd believe you.  For the accuracy and flavour of the dialogue, the complex yet simply believable characters, and the credible picture of high school it draws.	2002-06-29
US	49333751	R1W7HXCAK8U2TA	0140231900	361422595	Mr. Vertigo	Books	4	28	28	N	N	Auster's Fable	Paul Auster is usually a steadfastly metaphysical writer, procuring post-modern ideas from his books with the regularity of an oil derrick.  He's usually so preoccupied with the subtext of his works that the universes he creates come off as nondescript and inconsequential, and his prose remains, well, austere.  The purpose of this preamble is to prepare you for the marked departure that is \\"Mr. Vertigo\\".<br />The universe here is quite definite: America in the early twentieth century.  The prose is decidedly un-austere.  Auster attempts to authentically capture the lingo and rhythms of the 1920s and 1930s.  Either that, or he has created a grand parody of the way people spoke.  Either way, the dialogue here is colourful, flavourful, but sometimes peculiar.  Paul may have bit off more than he can chew.  Examples such referring to St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Dizzy Dean as 'The Dizmeister' try and inject style into corners where style isn't needed.  Was the name Dizzy not interesting enough?  A minor quibble, that.  (Dean also serves as an analogy-within-analogy; his meteoric rise and fall rivals that of our protagonist.)  For the most part Auster has a grand command of the language he uses.<br />But all this does not deny the fact that this book is still a pretty powerful analogy.  It is a picaresque, following the adventures of Walter Claireborne Rawley, a.k.a., Walt the Wonder Boy.  Rescued from a scamp's life by the mysterious Master Yehudi, Walt is taught to fly.  This curious skill -- the only piece of Auster-esque magic in a book that takes great pains to mimic its reality -- takes them on adventures all over the country.  And herein lies the analogy.  As Walt's powers and fame grows, so to do those of the young country on the verge of its own modern breakthroughs.  Walt's adventures parallel the rise and fall of American culture in its infancy: from Vaudeville, to the Circus, to motion pictures; from a run in with the Ku Klux Klan, to an allegiance with Prohibition-era Chicago gangsters.  Walt lives a kind of Forrest Gump-type existence.  The cherry on the sundae is his love for and near ruin at the hands of that most American of pastimes, baseball.  \\"Mr. Vertigo\\" is about America finding its wings, and Auster weaves its story with Walt's with near-seamless precision.<br />On a deeper level, it should not be overlooked that Master Yehudi is seen, several times, reading from a book of Spinoza.  My elementary understanding of the man's philosophies, with thanks to Bertrand Russell, indicates that Auster intended these passing mentions to have some weight.  The relationship between Master Yehudi and Walt is analogous to God's relationship to Man.  This is best seen in the (evil) training Walt must undergo in order to lift-off.  There are also references to bondage by outside sources, freedom stemming from self-determination, and happiness in the face of misfortune, that readers of both Spinoza and \\"Mr. Vertigo\\" will find familiar.  And finally, we get a philosophical explanation of why the boy can fly: \\"Everything that happens is a manifestation of God's inscrutable nature, and it is logically impossible that events should be other than they are,\\" says Spinoza.  So, Master Yehudi says, \\"In order to lift you off the ground, we have to crack the heavens in two.  We have to turn the whole bloody universe inside out.\\"  Familiarity with Spinoza is unnecessary (I only achieved mine in hindsight) but it might just enhance your experience with the novel.<br />Auster still manages to throw in some po-mo theorizing, this time on the nature of the book as a piece of fiction.  To begin with, one of the characters, a poor black boy with designs on getting into university, is named Aesop.  He writes a memoir (or is it a fable?) at one point, about which Walt says, \\"I laughed at some parts, I cried at others, and what more can a person want from a book than to feel the prick of such delights and sorrows?\\"  Auster does his best to inject such sorrows and delights into his book.  He also adds meta-fictional moments to the narrative: \\"If this were a movie, here's where the calendar pages would start flying off the wall,\\" Walt says, just as his career is about to take off, around the time when that cinematic cliche was forming.  And most tellingly of all, here's Walt (speaking words you'd expect Auster to believe) on his newly minted status: \\"I wasn't just a robot anymore, a wind-up baboon who did the same set of tricks for every show -- I was evolving into an artist, a true creator who performed as much for his own sake as for the sake of others.\\"  This book is Auster's most accessible work, and the above confirms that he knows exactly what he is doing.<br />If I've sounded like a book report at times, I apologize, but Auster's writing lends itself to this kind of reviewing.  It is concerned with the ideas that surround its fictions, so why shouldn't I take a stab at cracking the codes those ideas are trying to hide?  It brings me enjoyment to do so, and I suspect those of you reading this who also have a patient and curious mind will enjoy this book as well.	2002-06-12
US	49333751	R2E1WPZC5MOU4P	031228327X	10488731	Joe College: A Novel	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Danny's Inferno	Tom Perrotta is chronicler of man's troubles akin to a watered-down and American Nick Hornby, and a dialogist with the potential to be as good as Richard Russo.  He isn't nearly as good as either of these two fine writers.  But that's almost an unfair comparison.  Perrotta is good, and despite the fact that \\"Joe College\\" is a problematic and flawed book, it's still a pretty gripping and fun read.<br />Danny is a junior at Yale University, majoring in English and minoring in keeping his awkward social life straight.  Spring break is spent manning the lunch truck while his downtrodden father recovers from surgery, staying out of the way of racketeering group of rival lunch truckers, and avoiding Cindy, an ex-girlfriend who doesn't measure up to his highbrow standards.<br />This would all be pretty banal stuff, except for the fact that Danny is a narrator several years removed from these events.  Perrotta only sporadically gives us clues to this fact, unfortunately, but when he does it gives the story that much more power.  It becomes, then, the story of an older man looking back with new perspective on his bygone days of innocence.  And it is this new perspective that Danny sorely needs.  He's smart enough to know when he's doing/done wrong, but only with the benefit of hindsight.  One revelation has him reasoning why he hooked up with Cindy in the first place.  He notes early on that their first kiss prompted this internal monologue: \\"My first thought was, This is amazing!  My second was, She's a secretary!... it made me pull away in confusion.\\"  But later he explains that their relationship existed only because he was \\"trying to find a little company so [he] wouldn't have to spend [his] nights listening to Judas Priest and watching [porno] movies.\\"  If only he could have had this ignoble conclusion while it was happening, he might have saved himself and Cindy a whole lot of anguish.<br />As the narrator, Danny seems to understand this.  At times he appears to be hiding something, whether it's behind a clever joke (of which there are many) or even using a flashback to dig deeper still into his past, the purpose of which is to explain (or cloud) his motivations.  On top of this, we never learn his last name.  There are several opportunities where it could come out, but Danny stops himself short.  Which leads me to believe that he isn't really telling us the whole story.  There's obviously something more embarrassing to hear than what we get.  Danny is an unreliable narrator, that most-effective of post-modern rhetorical techniques.  The irony then is that he, an English major at the height of the post-modern movement, doesn't even realize this.  It's a neat trick that Perrotta tries to pull off, but it ultimately falls short.<br />Okay, now that I've got all that po-mo lit talk out of the way, let me quickly talk about why this book is so much fun.<br />Perrotta is a no-muss no-fuss writer.  His spare, matter-of-fact prose is very inviting, ably masking bigger themes.  Also, he's very credible in the way he portrays the way these twentysomethings communicate with each other.  A letter Cindy writes to Danny is just so spot-on and so hilarious in the way it perfectly captures the tone of someone with much passion, much to say, but little talent for actually saying (or writing) it.  Her overuse of capitalization, exclamation marks, and tangential thoughts remind me a lot of many a letter I received (and, yes I'll admit it, wrote) in my salad days.<br />Perrotta populates his story with a multitude of characters (I'd say too many at times), each bouncing off Danny for moments, and then disappearing into the background.  My favourite of these is Matt, a co-worker of Danny's whose uninhibited personality is always amusing.  Perrotta also populates the story with endless references to the time period.  Mentions of the Iran hostages (\\"I didn't learn that Americans were being held captive... until... my history TA made an offhand commentabout Ted Koppel's hairdo\\"), Steely Dan's \\"Gaucho\\" album, the rise of Ronald Reagan, and Jodie Foster's Yale tenure (she even has a cameo in one party scene) firmly entrench the book around the turn of the 1980s.<br />In the end, nothing really horrendous happens to Danny.  \\"Things could be worse,\\" he reminds himself.  \\"I wasn't in jail, I wasn't in the hospital, and I wasn't married.  My life was pretty much on track, unchanged by the obstacle course of potential disasters I'd been running for the past several days.\\"  Which nearly makes the book an empty exercies.  But Danny does manage to learn from these 'disasters', or at least we're lead to believe that he does.  I suspect just the act of writing his 'memoirs' (with Perrotta a more than able 'ghost-writer') proves this is true.	2002-06-03
US	49333751	RRXTR9W4CO304	0380789035	337033298	American Gods	Books	3	6	11	N	N	An intriguing concoction that never truly gels	Neil Gaiman's &quot;American Gods&quot;, an intentionally oxymoronic title, is about the impending battle between the old gods (pick your poison: Odin, Loki, Vishnu, etc.) and the &quot;new&quot; (junk culture: TV, advertising, gambling, etc.).  Stuck in the middle waiting to find out his destiny is a mortal man named Shadow.  Soon to be released from jail, Shadow looks forward to a reunion with his wife Laura.  Sadly, this reunion is not to be (or, it is not to be in the way Shadow envisions it).  Shadow, stricken by grief, is thus enlisted in a battle, one that may decide the fate of the world, by a mysterious man named Wednesday.<br />Similar thematic territory was covered, with much more panache and verve, by Douglas Adams (&quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot;) and by Neil's &quot;Good Omens&quot; writing partner, Terry Pratchett (&quot;Small Gods&quot;).  Both books took a sidelong glance at the subject of modern deities and found an awful lot of humour there.  Gaiman treats his subject with solemnity, and to my mind this is one of the reasons why the book suffers.<br />Fortunately, the story begins with a dramatic bang.  Gaiman sets up his characters well, and then proceeds to create the universe in which they will live.  He never betrays the beginning, but at times he lets the narrative (or, to describe it more accurately, the loose assemblage of scenes) get away from him.  &quot;I feel like I'm in a world with its own sense of logic.  It's own rules,&quot; Shadow notes at one point early on.  &quot;I'm just going along with it, you know?&quot;  This is true, and it begins as a wonderful creation in Gaiman's hands.  But later Shadow becomes more frustrated with the direction his life has taken:  &quot;Nobody tells me what [the rules] are.  You keep talking about the goddamn rules, I don't even know what game you people are playing.&quot;  This kind of frustration seeps into the reader's thoughts as well.  Gaiman takes great care in hiding his motivations from both his character and his audience.  You keep expecting a payoff, where the rules are explained, at least implicitly.  But that rarely happens, and when it does it is quite unsatisfactory.<br />He also neglects to assemble a unifying narrative.  What we have, instead, is an extended version of 'variations on a theme'.  Shadow's adventures, although different and interesting every time, still follow the same basic formula.  It becomes tiresome after a while.  And what narrative it does have goes on for far too long.  &quot;Not only are there no happy endings,&quot; someone says near the end, &quot;there aren't even any endings.&quot;  Too true in this case.  Further complicating things is the fact that this book has both an epilogue and a postscript.  Gaiman may not have wanted to leave the world he's created, but the reader can't wait for it to finally be over.<br />All that being said, there are moments here that carry a tremendous amount of stark weight.  One scene, at an odd boarding house, has Shadow losing a game of checkers only to face a frightening punishment: a sledgehammer to the head.  Thankfully, he's able to put it off.  Or is he?  Later, we see Shadow in a moment of extreme sacrifice.  Gaiman's descriptions of the broken man's thoughts in this chapter are heartbreaking, and believably authentic.  The scenes in Lakeside, a small-town safe haven, if taken on their own (with some obvious re-working) might have made a wonderful self-contained short story.  I just wish that Gaiman had found a way to string these events together in a unifying manner.  Out of nowhere, you find Shadow talking to Lucille Ball, as Lucy Ricardo, on an old black-and-white TV.  Or, apropos of nothing, Gaiman's narrator barges in to admit to the fictionality of the story he is telling:  &quot;None of this can actually be happening.  If it makes you more comfortable, you could simply think of it as a metaphor.&quot;  These are all great bits of writing, but they don't fittogether to make a cohesive whole.<br />&quot;American Gods&quot;, for me, is a very frustrating read, for just these reasons.  It has boundless potential, but at every turn Gaiman fails to reach the high levels he's aiming for.  It makes for a powerful work, one that's often boring, at times quite frustrating, but in moments quite exhilarating.  At nearly 600 pages, anything is going to be hit or miss.  I was just hoping for a few more hits from Gaiman, a writer I've admired in the past.  I admire him here, too.  I just didn't enjoy him that much.together to make a cohesive whole.<br />&quot;American Gods&quot;, for me, is a very frustrating read, for just these reasons.

US	49333751	R2PQIRUHILPX4W	0385493002	911059821	The Intuitionist: A Novel	Books	4	25	28	N	N	"They looked at the skin of things"	The central analogy of Colson Whitehead's \\"The Intuitionist\\" is quite simple: the elevator, an important device in the skyward expansion of metropolitan areas, can also serve to lift blacks into an equal position with whites.  It's simple, but it's also, at first thought, quite clumsy.  I know that was my reaction upon beginning this book.  Just like the advancement of modern engineering principles and the development of newer, stronger materials helped further develop the concrete jungle, so to must other factors assist the racial problem.  But Whitehead, an eminently skilled writer, has thought of this too.  And he knows something you don't know: it won't end the way you think it will end.  Armed with this knowledge, he is able to freely create his world.<br />And what a world it is.  Set in an unnamed metropolis, characterized by \\"magnificent elevated trains, five daily newspapers, [and] two baseball stadiums\\" that leaves some of its residents \\"too afraid to leave the house\\", Whitehead has created a hermetically sealed society.  He never flinches in his portrayal, offering up detail after detail of his little world that are at once believable and credible.  The centrepiece of this society, the raison d'etre, is that it takes elevator culture very seriously.  A weekly magazine, dedicated to said culture, is called \\"Lift\\".  Visionaries, such as Elisha Graves Otis and the recently deceased James Fulton, are revered much in the same that Plato or Aristotle are in our world.  And the Department of Elevator Inspectors serves as a neat little microcosm of the whole, not to mention a terribly desirable place of employment.  This is where the title character, Lila Mae Watson, works.  That is until the Number 11 cab at the Fanny Briggs building went into a free fall a day after her inspection (\\"Verticality is such a risky enterprise\\").  This is the cataclysmic event off of which the story unfolds.<br />Lila Mae is a strange creation.  She is cynical, headstrong, and fiercely intelligent (Case in point: she \\"does not expect human beings to conduct themselves in any other way but how they truly are.  Which is weak\\").  She's had a perfect record as an Intuitionist inspector in a world dominated by Empiricists.  But she's also learned to live in a racist world where she is the only female elevator inspector.  Watch her bite her tongue when a pushy salesman espouses the virtues of skin-lighteners and hair-straighteners.  Or see her reaction when, at a yearly banquet thrown by the Department, she's confronted by the antics of Hambone and Mr. Grizzard, a minstrel show eaten up by her white colleagues.  Lila Mae must keep her head, for in her search for the truth about the accident she is confronted by a series of shady characters, none of whom she can really trust.  Or can she?<br />It is this part of the book, within the detective story narrative, where Whitehead really shines.  He mixes into his dystopia nightmare a healthy amount of neo-film noir elements.  People are always sizing each other up, doing things to gauge reactions.  A security guard asks to see Lila Mae's badge, but he never really looks at it.  \\"He just asked for effect,\\" comments Whitehead's spare narrator.  Later, a scene is set inside a hotel room, where \\"the red neon of the liquor store sign across the street flashes... off and on.\\"  You almost expect Humphrey Bogart to emerge from such scenes.  Which makes for a fine contrast when you once again realize that you're reading Lila Mae's story.  There is nothing Bogart about her.<br />Up until the final act, I wasn't sure if I bought into all of Whitehead's ideas.  However, in that final act, he brings things together so smoothly and so efficiently, I couldn't help but see the light that he was shining right into my face.  His elevator analogy congeals nicely.  It ably pulls back society's veil to reveal that, as the fictional Mr. Fulton once wrote, \\"There is another world beyond this one.\\"  Pay attention throughout, be patient at the beginning, and trust that what Whitehead has for you at the end will make the whole enterprise worthwhile.  Follow this recipe, and you'll be impressed by \\"The Intuitionist\\" as much as I was.	2002-05-13
US	49333751	R23PG095C9FJPP	0553377884	466338532	Skinny Legs and All	Books	5	85	87	N	N	The skinny on when the last veil will fall	One of my biggest post-literate mistakes was choosing \\"Skinny Legs and All\\" as my first attempt at a Tom Robbins book.  It was a big mistake because, for that first pass, I didn't make it past page fifty.  And spent the next two years avoiding Tom's oeuvre, for fear of reliving that first awkward experience.  Hindsight tells me that those two years could have been spent in an enlightened, blissful state if I'd started my Robbins journey elsewhere.  When I tried \\"Skinny Legs\\" again, after 'getting' the Robbins of \\"Another Roadside Attraction\\" and \\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\\" and \\"Jitterbug Perfume\\", I was astounded at the magnitude of its greatness.  And more than a bit embarrassed that I passed off its hyper-creativity as just strangeness for strangeness' sake.<br />The strangeness I speak of, which rears its ugly (nay, sublime) head before page fifty, concerns an Airstream welded to look like a giant roast turkey, and sentient dialogues between a spoon, a dirty sock, and a Can o' Beans (and later, a mystical Conch Shell and a magical Painted Stick; ancient objects with an enormous task ahead of them).  Hmm.  A first time Tommer can be expected to run screaming from images like that, skeptical that they can be made credible.  But the seasoned pro knows that Tom has something exciting up his sleeve.  And can't wait to find out what it is.<br />\\"Skinny Legs\\" follows the 'exciting' adventures of Ellen Cherry Charles, erstwhile artist and sometimes waitress, and her newlywed husband Boomer Petway, creator of said turkeymobile.  Their plan is to drive from Virginia, which is too conservative to cultivate Ellen's artistic and sexual passions, to New York City.  The goal is to find fame and fortune in the art community.  Which they do, but not in the expected way.<br />While in New York, Tom throws in many issues and ideas that are as relevant today as they were in 1990 when the book was published.  More so, even.  Talk of New York terrorism, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and Jerusalem as a hot button issue, all inform the story in one way or another (as do Tom's staples: art, love, passionate sex, philosophy, history, etc. etc. etc.).  This can best be seen in one of Tom's most poignant creations: a restaurant named Isaac and Ishmael's, owned by a Jew and an Arab in an attempt to call attention to the brotherhood needed to end the conflict in the Middle East.  \\"To a bird in the air, it's beanies versus dishcloths,\\" notes the I&I's Arab owner, Roland Abu Hadee, before he summarize the foolishness of the situation.  \\"To a bug on the street, both groups are the same.\\"  Tom's handling of the Israel conflict, and the way he weaves it into his story, is masterful.  He takes his position on the conflict (through the I&I, which in an attempt at reconciliation is not-so-incidentally named after Sarah's sons: the bastard child who went on to become the father of the Arabs, and the legitimate child who went on to become the father of the Hebrews), allows his characters their passions, and even offers a number of fanciful solutions.<br />But he's not always fanciful and flippant about the situation.  One character notes that as New York and London and Tokyo, etc. are all about money, \\"Jerusalem is about... something else.\\"  It's a complicated city, with a complicated history, embroiled in a conflict that's \\"an overload of craziness... a seventy-piece orchestra rehearsing a funeral dirge and a wedding march simultaneously in a broom closet.\\"<br />While that part of the book is concerned with the unknowable, the rest of the book tries to find a solution to such problems.  Enter the stories of Jezebel (idolater, hussy, face-painter, former Queen of northern Israel) and Salome (she of the Dance of the Seven Veils).  Both figures make metaphorical and nearly literal returns to our modern world in the book.  In doing so, they lift \\"the veils of ignorance, disinformation, and illusion [that] separate us from that which is imperative to our understanding of our evolutionary journey, shield us from the Mystery that is central to being.\\"  This is, in just one sentence, Tom Robbins' goal for this sprawling and magical book.<br />Along the way to achieving this goal here, Tom's flair for humourous language and analogy is at its peak.  This, to me, has always been the sugar that allows Tom's sometimes-harsh medicine to go down easily.  Here lie some of my favourites:<br />...Concerning the name of an ancient leader of Babylon: \\"Nebuchadnezzar is a poem... a swarm of killer bees let loose in the halls of the alphabet.\\"<br />...Ellen Cherry practicing the menu of the I&I, at which she is the hostess, with Boomer:<BR>\\"Now what the heck is 'roz bel khalta'?\\"<BR>\\"Yiddish for Mrs. Jimmy Carter?\\"<br />...\\"Eviction was staring [Ellen] in the face like a deviate on the subway\\".  (This last one is important to me because not only is it a powerful simile, but it is a powerful *New York* simile; there's nothing more stereotypically New York than deviates on the Subway.  Tom, as you can see, is in full control of his gifts here.)<br />\\"Pious dogma, if allowed to flourish,\\" says the Conch Shell.  \\"Will always drive magic away.\\"  For Tom Robbins, an author who buys magic wholesale and manages to fashion it into something even more tangible and wonderful, this is the cruelest death that can be inflicted on mankind.  Rest assured, he's doing everything within his literary powers to make sure that never happens.  \\"Skinny Legs and All\\" is a perfect symbol for this fight.  Now it's your job as a reader, whether a Tom-newbie or someone who's been down his lush paths before, to have patience, keep an open mind, and know that Tom would never steer you wrong.  Least not here, in one of his masterpieces.	2002-05-05
US	49333751	R1YGS72IH5VJIE	0140178139	317388917	Leviathan	Books	4	40	41	N	N	An austere and enormous entertainment	Paul Auster is a blatantly theoretical novelist.  He dissects and deconstructs literary genres and trends with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker.  But some accuse him of abandoning the delight of a story for a view from the ivory tower.  I tend to disagree, for the most part, but offer up &quot;Leviathan&quot; as an example of an Auster book that's both a page-turner and a think-piece.<br />For po-mo lit-lovers, Auster is in fine form.  His modus operandi of casting himself as the literary quasi-detective is in full effect here.  Narrator Peter Aaron (check those initials) is married to lovely Iris (Auster is married to novelist *Siri* Hustvedt).  He is a writer by trade.  &quot;My books are published... people read them, and I don't have any idea who they are... as long as they have my book in their hands, my words are the only reality that exists for them,&quot; he says, defensively.<br />The book he is currently writing -- and the book &quot;you&quot; are currently holding -- is an examination of his recently deceased friend, Benjamin Sachs (&quot;Six days ago, a man blew himself up by the side of the road in Northern Wisconsin,&quot; reads the novel's enticing opening line).  Sachs has enough vaguely roguish qualities to make &quot;Leviathan&quot; a fascinating picaresque.  But he's also an idealist, and fiercely intelligent.  He's a writer manque, whose first novel blew the critics away but was a failure with readers.  Sachs is a character who exists mostly in absentia, periodically jumping back into Aaron's life to offer up enough details to tantalize his friend, and keep the reader off-balance.  &quot;Even though Sachs confided a great deal to me over the years of our friendship,&quot; Aaron says.  &quot;I don't claim to have more than a partial understanding of who he was.  I can't dismiss the possibility that... the truth is quite different from what I imagine it to be.&quot;  This is Auster playing with the concept of the unreliable narrator, only here the narrator is aware that he's unreliable.  An interesting concept, that.<br />But &quot;Leviathan&quot; is not just conceptual.  It's loaded with intriguing personalities, and a lot of implicit suspense.  And Auster's habit of digressing from the story to discuss an interesting tangent yields at least one fascinating sequence.  Sachs' novel, entitled &quot;The New Colossus&quot;, is summarized by Aaron.  Auster spares no expense, creating an appealing advertisement for a historical page-turner that doesn't exist.  But within that summary he also explicates some of his own novel's grander themes.<br />The main one, and it's all over the place here, is America as a place of infinite possibilities for freedom but a failure in terms of realizing those possibilities.  &quot;America has lost its way,&quot; Aaron writes, when talking about the message of Sachs' book.  &quot;Thoreau was the one man who could read the compass for us, and now that he is gone, we have no hope of finding ourselves again.&quot;  Further examination reveals that the Statue of Liberty, as an icon or just a concept, is &quot;Leviathan's&quot; dominant motif.  It appears in Sachs' book and in a poignant memory from his childhood.  The occasion of her hundredth birthday forms the background for the novel's great turning point.  And if not for the Lady's presence, the climax of the book would be hokey and overwrought.  As it is, she lends it dignity and class, amplifying its intensity and greatness.<br />Using spare but consequential prose, Auster has written another novel that straddles the line between pulp and intricate fiction.  It never panders to the unintellectual audience, but also never dumbs itself down.  And it reaches that fine balance with seemingly relative ease, a trademark of Auster's other works.  Try this one first before jumping to &quot;The New York Trilogy&quot; or &quot;The Music of Chance&quot;.  I dare say you won't be disappointed.	2002-04-24
US	49333751	R3KIA20Y3K4M0L	0671742515	238243512	The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul	Books	4	13	15	N	N	Dirk II: The Stupefying Sequel	Like it's predecessor, &quot;Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency&quot;, &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot; demands a second reading.  It's complex, often confusing, but never less than amusing.  Both books display Douglas Adams' verbal wit, which will remind most of his ever-popular &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; books, but are more concerned with their labyrinthine and well-structured plots.  And both books offer an ending that may not make sense if the reader hasn't been paying close (and I mean CLOSE) attention.  The main difference between the two is that while the ending of the former was obscure *and* painstakingly logical, the ending here feels contrived and illogical.  Like a good mystery novel, the reader should have been able to see it coming given the clues presented.  In &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; this was true; it necessitated some research to fathom, but with enough effort the reader could make sense of things.  Here, not so much.<br />That's not to say that &quot;Tea-Time&quot; is a pointless endeavor.  It is, after all, a Douglas Adams novel.  And now that the man is gone, we should cherish everything he's ever written.  In their own ways they're all gems.  This gem, however, has less of a sheen.<br />Once again, Dirk Gently is asked to save the world.  Or rather, he's asked to not screw it up so much.  He's a detective who believes in the interconnectedness of everything.  This point is only sporadically touched on here, but is relayed at great length in the previous book.  Pity, because Adams has constructed a narrative whose tentacles dip into a myriad of different subjects and storylines, all for the most part unrelated.  But he does draw them all together, seemingly against their will, in the end.  The drawback, then, is that the book becomes less a cohesive novel than a collection of eclectic ideas.  I'd have loved to see how Adams further involved the electric I Ching calculator (a favourite tool of the Electric Monk maybe?) in the story.But alas it comes and goes all too quickly.  The same can be said for The Great Zaganza, a horoscope writer who puts private joke messages to Dirk directly in each day's newspaper.  Or Elena, the wayward maid, who's locked in a battle of wills with Dirk to see who will open his refrigerator first (Why?  I'll never tell).  These are all wonderful ideas, pregnant enough for a whole chapter (or a whole book) in Adams' hands, but nearly wasted here.  Thankfully, there are enough of them to make a mild mosaic of mystery on which the narrative balances.<br />The book shares one of its main themes with Terry Pratchett's &quot;Small Gods&quot;.  This is not the first time I've favourably compared Adams to Pratchett, and vice versa.  I suspect if you like the wicked wit and playful literary structures of one, than you'll adore the other just as much.  Adams relies less on puns than Pratchett, and more on cultural mythology, but they were equally adept at deconstructing popular images to their own ends.<br />Before treading here I recommend a bit of research first.  Read the first &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; book.  Since Adams doesn't repeat his introduction and explanation of the main character, those unfamiliar with him will find Dirk's methods baffling.  They are explained fully, just not here.  Also, it might be a good idea to brush up on your Norse mythology before entering.  No need to go too deep, just a trip to Valhalla will do.  And finally, remember this: pay attention to everything.  Nothing is accidental here.  Everything matters.  Everything is connected.  Enjoy!	2002-04-19
US	49333751	R2STNXKN8EZ792	0679432477	340719393	Empire Falls	Books	4	13	16	N	N	Russo again stands peerless	It might not be fair, but when you compare \\"Empire Falls\\", point by point, with other books in Richard Russo's canon, it doesn't quite measure up.  Quasi-protagonist Miles' (why 'quasi'?  More on that later...) relationship with his father is not nearly as powerful nor as funny as Ned and Sam's relationship in \\"The Risk Pool\\".  Nor is his relationship with his daughter as strongly realized as Sully and Peter's is in \\"Nobody's Fool\\".  And the 'Empire Grill' doesn't have near the allure or reality of 'The Elm's' found in the former book, and 'Hattie's Lunch' found in the latter.<br />Okay, maybe it is fair, because Russo keeps trodding on the same territory.  This is another book set in an east coast town, beset by slow economic times and constant tragedy (\\"What kind of man... would walk up to another human being... and squeeze another death into the world?\\" asks Miles, showing the novel's pessimistic world-view).  It is another book that deals with how families, neighbours, lovers, and enemies deal with each other, whether explicitly or implicitly.  It is a book that relies on simple situations turned melodramatic, and complex situations turned comic.  But I'll repeat an analogy I've used many times when talking about Russo's books: when you only know one song, it helps if you play it well.  And Russo does.<br />The biggest change between \\"Empire Falls\\" and the rest of Russo's book is that he relies less on his samurai-like skills for creating winning and realistic dialogue, instead preferring to internalize many of his characters' thoughts.  The story is not told exclusively from Miles point of view (I told you I'd explain the 'quasi' prefix).  Russo gets inside the head of many of his characters, for a chapter or two, which allows them to give their perspective on the story (As if \\"Rashomon\\" were set in Maine).  The effect of this is to lighten Miles' position as protagonist, instead allowing that burden to fall on the town itself.  Which in a way explains why, asthe titles of his previous books often referred to their main characters (\\"Nobody's Fool\\", \\"Straight Man\\"), this book is called, pun likely intended, \\"Empire Falls\\".  The town is the protagonist.<br />That's not to diminish Miles' importance to the story.  He is still the fulcrum around which most of the action pivots.  But he's very different from the typical Russo 'hero'.  When Bea, his ex-mother-in-law, describes him as \\"about the nicest, saddest man in Empire Falls, a man so good-natured that not even being married to her daughter, Janine, had ruined him\\", that's typical Russo.  But a later exchange with Mrs. Whiting, owner and operator of the only successful businesses in Empire Falls, colours him thusly:<br />\\"The old woman clapped her hands in delight.  'I don't know why I'm always so surprised to be reminded of your sense of humor, dear boy.'<BR>'Did I say something funny?' Miles inquired.\\"<br />You can see how he's far less self-aware than Sully, Ned, Hank from \\"Straight Man\\", or even Dallas Younger from Russo's first book, \\"Mohawk\\".  Those men all knew the power of a witty quip, and would wield them easily when the time called for it.  Miles has that skill too, but is usually too run down to bother.  Instead, he lets the people around him get off the best lines.  In fact, they all seem to recognize this apathy in him, and try desperately, up until the book's final act, to get Miles to loosen up and show his true colours.<br />Paradoxically, though, Russo doesn't use his secondary characters nearly enough.  I would have liked to have spent more time with some of them, like Horace, the wizened and wise newspaper reporter, or David, Miles' no-nonsense younger brother, or Max, the shameless patriarch of the Roby clan.  In Russo's other books, these witty but down-on-their-luck men would constantly be whispering into Miles' ear, for better or for worse but always entertaining.<br />These run-down but impish middle-aged characters are replaced in the narrative by a flurry of teenagers.  Miles' daughter Tick, an expertly realized creation (save for her never-explained handle), is a joy to read.  She is smart and shy, and Russo portrays her awkwardness wonderfully.  But the teens that surround her, when she lets them, are more often than not cardboard and cliche.  And Russo gets a tad melodramatic when it comes to these renderings of teenagedom.  True, in the end, as you will soon see, it becomes necessary.  But while it's happening, it breaks up the understated tone that his adults have worked so hard to achieve.<br />About three-quarters of the way through, I was all ready to bemoan \\"Empire Falls'\\" position in the lower pantheon of Russo's books (down there with the aforementionned \\"Mohawk\\").  But the last hundred pages are startling.  He abandons the exposition of character, and concentrates hard on rendering an emotional (no, too weak a word; try 'heartbreaking') narrative conclusion.  It gets melodramatic in moments, and relies a little too much on cliffhanger shocks, but it sent me into to a state where I couldn't wait to turn the next page, knowing full well that what I found there might cause my heart to jump out of my chest.	2002-04-13
US	49333751	RC4GXNRYKM67H	0671746723	312152799	Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency	Books	4	12	15	N	N	Interconnected to all things	A lot of the talk surrounding &quot;Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency&quot; centres on its utter incomprehensibility, its snail-like slow start, and the fact that it's not nearly as funny as Adams' &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; books.<br />Regarding the first point, I'd agree, but only to a degree.  It's not really as complicated as many have made it out to be.  All it takes to understand the complex ending is the knowledge of one simple fact.  You'll have to find out what that fact is for yourself, for I'll never tell.  (Trust me... the information *is* out there if you know where to look)  That being said, there are bits and pieces strewn throughout the book that still have me scratching my head (Why did the Electric Monk do what he did?  What was the point of that fascinating bit about Schrodinger's Cat?  Who was climbing the stairs of that ominous tower, and what the heck was that tower anyway?).  All of which make me agree with the general consensus:  This is a book that rewards, nay, demands a second reading.  And quite possibly a third, fourth, and fifth.<br />Regarding the second point, it's only slow when compared to a book as deliciously frenetic as &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;.  But on a grander scale, &quot;Dirk&quot; moves along at a perfect pace.  And frankly, if the reader is to be expected to pick up on the subtle clues Adams drops, a slow pace is exactly what he needs.  Just be warned:  When everything starts falling into place, the pace picks up and you might be inclined to pick up your reading pace.  Don't.  There's still important information at the end that you might miss.<br />Regarding the third point, well, this one I fully agree with.  Only I think it was never Adams' intention to write something as laugh out loud funny as the books that made him internationally popular.  He was aiming for a think-piece.  He wanted to write his own version of the hard-boiled detective novel, a la Chandler or Hammett, albeit filteredthrough his warped British sense of humour (&quot;The door was the way to... to...The Door was The Way.  Good.  Capital Letters were always the best way of dealing with things you didn't have a good answer to.&quot;).  You'll enjoy the laughs brought on by Dirk and Richard's warped conversations, but they won't be as plentiful or as boisterous as the laughs brought on by an Arthur Dent/Ford Prefect conversation.  Further to that point, however, is the fact that Richard MacDuff (&quot;Tall and absurdly thin... good-natured... a bit like a preying mantis that doesn't prey... a sort of a pleasant genial mantis that's given up preying and taken up tennis instead&quot;) is a perfect conduit through which the reader can understand the story.  Whenever Dirk goes on one of his wild rants, one that will have the reader asking himself, &quot;What is he talking about?&quot; Richard will ask Dirk, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;  He's always one step ahead of the reader's questions.<br />More than any other book I've ever read, &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; is perfectly structured, while still leaving a lot of holes for the reader, through his own research and interpretation, to fill in.  You may get to the end and wonder if you've missed something.  Chances are you probably have.  But that's by Adams' design.  This is a book that lives on well past the last page has been turned.  I know that I'm looking forward to my next encounter with Dirk, and saddened that Adams won't be around to create any more new universes for his faithful readership to enjoy.	2002-04-03
US	49333751	RNVYM1ZT6565H	0156439611	466126836	If on a Winter's Night a Traveler	Books	4	195	209	N	N	A conceptual review of a conceptual book	You are getting ready to read an Amazon.com review of Italo Calvino's book \\"If on a winter's night a traveller\\".  Is your mouse nearby?  Are you sitting in a comfortable chair?  You're not slouching over the keyboard, are you?  Sit up!  Now, rub your eyes, close any windows containing video games, and read on.<br />-----<br />Besides Tom Robbins' \\"Half Asleep in Frog's Pajamas\\", this is the only book you've ever read written (mostly) in second person narration.  'You' are the protagonist of the story, and are directly addressed by the author/narrator.  'You' are the Reader.  This is a technique that Calvino uses very well, especially when he manages to predict (or accurately tell) the circumstances around how 'you' bought the book, how 'you're' reading it, and 'your' thoughts and feelings concerning it.<br />You notice that this book has no story, per se.  Instead, it is about Stories.  The structure of the book is more important than the narrative thrust.  A Reader (you) begins reading Italo Calvino's new book, \\"If on a winter's night a traveller\\".  But the book is misprinted, and ends halfway through.  So you head down to the bookshop, anxious to get your money back.  There you encounter The Other Reader, a young woman also foiled in her attempt to read Calvino's new book.  You both buy a new copy from the shopkeeper, only when you get it home, you realize it is not Calvino's new book at all, but something called \\"Outside the town of Malbork\\".  Things continue this way, back and forth from thwarted novel to encounters with The Other Reader (who, by this time, you've developed quite a crush on).  Along the way, you will meet many other shady literary characters, like The Non Reader, The Writer, and the Plagiarist.  Do not be afraid of these men.  They are merely devices to get you thinking about the nature of reading, the nature of writing, the nature of authorship, and a number of other significant post-modern issues.<br />This all sounds quite fascinating to you,but you still have trepidations.  You have a copy of the book with you right now.  To help quench your fears you open it up, seemingly at random, to page 197, and read the following exchange:<br />\\"'On the contrary, I am forced to stop reading just when [the stories] become more gripping.  I can't wait to resume, but when I think I am reopening the book I began, I find a completely different book before me...'<BR>'Which instead is terribly boring,' I suggest.<BR>'No, even more gripping.  But I can't manage to finish this one, either.  And so on.'\\"<br />You think this is pretty good so far.  But wonder, is Calvino right on either count?  Would such a novel be \\"terribly boring\\", or \\"even more gripping\\"?  Would you get frustrated beyond repair if the story kept stopping, every time it got good?  You realize that you must decide for yourself before you begin reading the book in earnest.  <br />Continuing your perusal on the same page, you read the following passage:<br />\\"I have had the idea of writing a novel composed only of beginnings of novels.  The protagonist could be a Reader who is continually interrupted.  The Reader buys the new novel A by the author Z.  But it is a defective copy, he can't go beyond the beginning... He returns to the bookshop to have the volume exchanged...\\"<br />You stop, because you can see where this is going.  This is Calvino telling you the genesis of this book.  This kind of self-reflexivity sometimes gives you a headache, for a story within a story within a story (etc.) can sometimes be very confusing.  You stop reading for a while to get your bearings.<br />You take a break by going to the fridge for a glass of juice.<br />Later, you flip the book open again, this time to page 218, and you notice this:<br />\\"Then what use is your role as protagonist to you?  If you continue lending yourself to this game, it means that you, too, are an accomplice of the general mystification.\\"<br />\\"Calvino is challenging me?\\" you think to yourself.\\"He doesn't think I am capable of following him through this labyrinthine world.  He doesn't think I have the brainpower.  But I do!\\"  You are getting a good head of steam now.  \\"I can read his book, no problem!  I am a Good Reader.\\"<br />You turn to page one, intent on starting and then finishing this book.  And when you do, you'll realize that it was a rewarding, if oftentimes difficult and confusing, experience.  It will have questioned your preconceived notions of what it means to read, write, to tell stories, and to listen to them.  And it will do it in a (mostly) fascinating and suspenseful way, to make the ideas go down that much easier.	2002-03-29
US	49333751	RMJ66LV5AH2R6	0375504753	388996587	Fierce Pajamas: An Anthology of Humor Writing from The New Yorker	Books	4	59	67	N	N	Head-Funny, but not Gut-Funny	The prose here sparkles.  Purple, in the best sense of the world.  Ideas are bandied about left and right like badminton birdies.  Themes are covered copiously.  Wit and wisdom are abundant, brought out whenever the author needs it, like a samurai does with his sword.  The pieces are all triumphs of economy, setting up their propositions and then quickly cutting to the punchline(s) before the reader becomes bored.  Writing of this magnitude, especially when collected from such a fine variety of sources in one collection, is to be treasured and preserved.  The superlatives for this book are immeasurable... except that it's not funny. <br />Oh, it's funny, alright.  Just not the right kind of funny.  &quot;That was clever,&quot; you might say to yourself, after a romp through one of Garrison Keillor's prose pieces.  &quot;I wonder if I should chortle now?  I think I shall... Chortle!&quot;  Or: &quot;Look, mum: alliteration!  How ingenious.  I marvel at the textbook examples of Comedy found herein.&quot;  It's humour of the head, as you can see, but rarely humour from the gut.  The kind that causes an unexpected snort, embarrassing you in a room full of stranger.  Or, the kind that promises a swift trip up the nasal passages for the mouthful of milk you just gulped.  This is the kind of visceral humour that I expected.  Alas, I did not get it.<br />Let me show you what I mean, by giving some examples of Head-Funny (not Gut-Funny) pieces:  Polly Frost's 'Notes on My Conversations', in which the author imagines herself as a professional conversationalist; Thomas Meehan's 'Yma Dream', in which the author must disastrously introduce a series of guests at a party he is throwing (example: &quot;Ilya, Ira, here's Yma, Ava, Oona.  Ilya, Ira -- Ona, Ida, Abba, Ugo, Aga.&quot;  You get the idea); Roger Angell's 'Ainmosni', in which the author devises a simple plan for curing insomnia: playing with well-known palindromes! (&quot;A woman, a plan, a canal: Panamowa&quot;); Bill Franzen's 'Hearing From Wayne', in which Wayne sends a postcard to Bill... from the afterlife.  Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed all these pieces.  Immensely.  But the promised laughs didn't materialize.  Instead, I got pieces that made me think, that made me ponder, that made me contemplate.  But laugh?  No.  Not out loud, anyway (and frankly, an out-loud laugh is the only kind that counts).<br />I will admit, though, that there were isolated moments of gut-busting.  Chet Williamson's 'Gandhi at the Bat', in which the The Mahatma pinch-hits for Red Ruffing.  &quot;C'mon, Moe!&quot; Babe Ruth pleads.  &quot;Show 'em the old pepper!&quot;  To which Gandhi replies: &quot;I will try, Mr. Baby!&quot;  Jack Handey's 'Stunned' is a surreal account of a man and his telescope, through which he has discovered conclusive evidence of life outside our own solar system (or has he?).  Noah Baumbach's 'Keith Richards' Desert-Island Disks' takes said list, published in Pulse magazine, and imagines what would happen if Keef actually ended up on the island with only these disks (hint: he gets sick of &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; pretty quickly).  Anthony Lane's 'Looking Back in Hunger' is a wonderfully vitriolic look at cookbooks, and how they mess with our minds.  Martin Amis' 'Tennis Personalities' proves in two scant pages why I think he is the only perfect writer working today (regular readers of this space will already know I think this way).  And in the book's final section we get some perfectly precise verse, most notably from E.B. White, Dorothy Parker, and Ogden Nash.<br />In his introduction, David Remnick (or is it Henry Finder?) points out that &quot;you might be ill-advised to read this book straight through&quot; because, and here he quotes Russell Baker, &quot;humour is funny when it sneaks up on you and takes you by surprise.&quot;  Having come to the end of this anthology, I suspect they're right.  Expectations can sometimes sap energy.  Calling something &quot;An Anthology of Humour Writing&quot; might just wring the humour out of it.  But I hope that the examples I've given above indicate that when the collection isn't funny, and it's rarely gut-bustingly funny, it is still highly worthwhile.	2002-03-13
US	49333751	R1Z6I9GKYKGKKL	0140771972	101716163	Critical Studies Great Gatsby	Books	4	14	28	N	N	Is &quot;Gatsby&quot; great?  No.  Is it good?  Very much so.	I finished reading &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; two days ago, an endeavor that took me more than a week to complete.  Not that the novel is voluminous; in fact it's a rather slight 172 pages.  It took me that long because for the most part I was bored silly.  I didn't care a whit about the characters, and that's all there really is to the book: a bunch of vapid characters.  You'd think that a book so highly acclaimed for so long would have at least some semblance of story to hang its hat on.  Alas, it is not so.  And Fitzgerald's prose, and I know I'm in the minority opinion here, never reached me.  Many times I caught him trying too hard, reaching for poetry but landing short on dogged doggerel.<br />That being said, after 48 hours of contemplation, I realize that I really do like the book.  Mostly.<br />Why?  First of all, it features a finely realized paradoxical title character.  Gatsby (both the character and the novel, as it turns out) isn't so great.  Is the title ironic?  He doesn't appear for the first fifty or so pages, and then when he does he's introduced through a misunderstanding: it turns out he was sitting right there all along!  He's a cipher, filled to the brim by the gossip and stories told about him during the parties in his own house.  But nobody, save for narrator Nick and delicate Daisy, really gets to know him.  The reader does, and finds him to be a prissy and pretentious fakir, prone to calling everyone &quot;Old Sport&quot; without ever meaning that term as an endearment.  Not great at all, I'd say.<br />The book's second saving grace is that it ends on a spectacular note.  The last thirty pages or so hold some of the best writing I've ever read.  While the novel opens with a constant barrage of strangers welcomely crashing the elaborate parties that Gatsby gives every night, the novel ends with a scenario exactly opposite to that.  I'll leave it to your reading to discovery what that might mean.  Without giving away any of the content ofthese chapters, I will say that they are filled with tangible pathos, visceral emotion, spare but vivid prose, and heartbreaking reality.  It makes me wish that Fitzgerald had focused his pen more on these poignant moments than on the abject flightiness that dominates the book's first three quarters.  He does show throughout that he is more than capable of this.  His flair for dramatic moments sporadically rears its head.  There's a moment when Tom suddenly breaks Mrs. Wilson's nose.  It comes out of nowhere for the reader, but upon reflection, it doesn't feel contrived.  It's one of Fitzgerald's strengths that I wish he'd have utilized more often.<br />His other strength, and the third of the book's great features, is the way he uses his narrator.  Nick Carraway at one point says, &quot;I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.&quot;  It's a curious statement for a narrator to make.  &quot;Believe me,&quot; he appears to be saying.  &quot;All of this is true.&quot;  It's the unreliable narrator (his recollections may or may not be clouded by his affection for Gatsby) protesting against his inherent unreliability.  Nick is beneath, in terms of class, the people he socializes with, which makes him less self-involved and more perceptive of others.  At one point he suddenly remembers that today is his 30th birthday!  Imagine this story told through the eyes of that uber-solipsist Daisy Buchanan?  Or, for that matter, the self-deluded Gatsby himself?  We'd never have gotten past the narrator's own eyelids.  Nick goes much further than that, and is very effective in his role.  And so is, as it turns out, Fitzgerald.	2002-02-28
US	49333751	R3A90JLH9QL7UN	0060932139	104524934	The Unbearable Lightness of Being	Books	2	17	25	N	N	Kundera: "Es Muss Sein!"  Me: Not Like This, It Doesn't."	This is a largely problematic novel, from the title on down.<br />The heaviest burden, as Nietzsche observed and Kundera reiterates here, is that our lives may live themselves out over and over again, an infinite number of times.  Thus, if our lives are lived out only once, they are a light burden.  The unbearable lightness of being, then, comes when we realize that we don't have infinite choices or infinite paths to go down, but in fact have one life down one path.<br />I was looking forward to Kundera further examining this point, in the context of a fictional narrative.  He does, but in such a way that subverts this central thesis.  The novel's structure, ostensibly one of its strong points, is to blame.  We see events repeated over and over, from different temporal locations, and from different points of view.  It's as if lives are repeating all over this place.  Kundera labels this 'eternal return', which sounds like the concept of Buddhist reincarnation, only without ever reaching Nirvana.  Or, to put it in more secular terms, it's Bill Murray in \\"Groundhog Day\\", only instead of one day repeating, it's a whole life done over and over again.  Thus, that realization that is so central to the novel's themes (and title) is made moot.  I'll give Kundera a bit of the benefit of the doubt, for maybe he was intentionally subverting his own themes (an interesting conceit).  It just wasn't explicit, or nearly effective enough.<br />And this structure, while providing interesting thematic questions, at times clouded the forward momentum of the narrative.  We learn early on of a character's death that will happen later on in the story.  However, we never see that character die.  Kundera promises a payoff (the emotional / visceral death scene), but never delivers it.  This happened several times and was awfully frustrating.<br />I did enjoy his brief flirtations with post-modern self-reflexivity (i.e., the novel's concern with its own status as a novel).  A discussion about \\"Anna Karenina\\" feeling fictional and novelistic functions as Kundera subverting his own readers' protests that this novel is too novelistic.  But this technique was used too excessively.  Kundera, constantly intruding on the narrative asking me to forgive him for intruding on the narrative, while an intriguing concept, smacked of wanting to have his cake and eat it too.<br />What makes this novel so paradoxical is that many of the things I liked about it, caused me to dislike other things.  A section detailing the four ways people want to be looked at was quite good.  It's a theory that I fully believe in, one that shapes personality, choice, attitudes, morals, ethics, etc.  However, it points to Kundera's failure at creating characters based on their own actions and attitudes.  His constant interruptions, usually to tell the reader what and how to think about a particular scene or character, intruded on the story.  \\"Show\\" me, don't \\"tell\\" me.<br />As for the quality of the prose, Kundera can be a chunky, cliched, melodramatic writer: <br />\\"In death, [Name withheld so as not to spoil] at last belonged to his [again, withheld].  He belonged to her as HE HAD NEVER BELONGED TO HER BEFORE.\\"  [caps are mine]<br />I hope, through the prison bars that are my square brackets, you can see how afternoon-soap-opera that sentence is.  The only way it becomes more offensive is if you read it with a clenched fist and a single tear running down your face.  And it's just one of many trite sentences sprinkled throughout the book.  Kundera talks a lot about poetry, but his prose can be quite impotent<br />One character's ideas are said to be \\"dangerous and [they] distanced her from the rest of mankind\\".  Well, no they aren't.  Or rather, they are, but only because she, and the shallow group of people she spends time with, believe that they are.  Kundera's characters are self-destructive naval gazers.  They pay lip service to the dangers of the Russian occupancy, but are really more concerned with the Big Ideas blasting around inside their Important Heads.<br />The last chapter, the content of which I am loath to give away, concludes the novel fittingly.  It made me groan, it annoyed me, it caused me to curse under my breath at the amount of time I had wasted reading this book.  I'm willing to concede that many of the problems detailed could have been the fault of the translator.  Maybe \\"Nesnesitelna Lehkost Byti\\" is a better book than \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\".  Thus, I can't be as harsh as I'd like to be.  Still, the reading of this book was not a pleasurable experience.  Hardly bearable, I'd say.	2002-02-21
US	49333751	R2IDFSUFT38TNW	0786866748	565829447	The War Against Cliche: Essays and Reviews, 1971-2000	Books	5	74	77	N	N	Amis, light of my life, fire of my mind	Martin Amis doesn't write for you.  He doesn't write for himself.  He doesn't write for his wife, or his kids.  He doesn't even write for his publisher, or the various periodicals to which he contributes.  Martin Amis writes for Vladimir Nabokov.  Well, maybe for Kingsley, too, but mostly for Nabokov.  You can see it in every labyrinthine sentence, in the complex prose, in the wit, the intellect, and the iconoclastic tendencies that reign over this stunning collection of literary reviews, taken from the last 30 years of Amis' writing career.<br />Okay, he's not only writing for Nabokov.  So who is Amis' ideal reader?  One who has an &quot;imagination, memory, a dictionary, and some artistic sense.&quot;  Amis searches to challenge you, but also to entertain.  And that passing remark about the dictionary was not made in jest.  Amis is the one author whose logocentrism forces me to the dictionary with pleasure.  Nearly every paragraph.<br />The collection's title comes from Amis' belief that &quot;all writing is a campaign against cliche&quot;, not just in a literary sense, but also in a human sense.  He takes his role in this campaign very seriously, as an author, stating that we should expect artists &quot;to stand as critics not just of their particular milieu but of their society, and of their age&quot;.  Even so, he regrets the advent of the artist-critic, i.e. novelists 'feeling' their way through criticism, rather than using the tools of theory to review literature.  Instead, Amis, who could easily have traded on his name and fallen in step with these artist-critics, uses a background of unabashed joy in the face of literary theory to give his reviews weight.<br />If the above makes the collection sound pedantic and tiresome, don't worry.  It isn't.  Amis may be serious about his job, but he sure can have some fun.  In a piece on Hillary Clinton's child-rearing instructional, Amis grumbles about her quaint but queasy neologisms: &quot;'Stomachachy'... is not acampaign stop on the way to Poughkeepsie but Hillary's epithet for a pain in the gut.&quot;  Later, in a piece on soccer (ahem, football), he begins cheekily: &quot;Readers... who like football probably like football so much that, having begun the present article, they will be obliged to finish it.&quot;  The rest of the paragraph is spent teasing the reader, threatening to never get to the meat of the article, with full knowledge that the reader isn't going anywhere.<br />In discussing why Cyril Connolly only wrote one novel (&quot;The Rock Pool&quot;), Amis notes that Connolly was &quot;ruined by too much fiction-reviewing: he knew all the larks, and he knew them all too well.&quot;  Amis, prolific novelist and critic, doesn't fall into this trap.  He is able to keep his fiction out of his reviewing.  I'm thankful, because I love Amis' fiction.  But his reviewing is still loaded with the kind of samurai imagery that Amis is so adept at.  Discussing Elmore Leonard's penchant for rejecting the imperfect/present/historic tense, in favour of &quot;a kind of marijuana tense, ... creamy, wandering, weak-verbed.&quot;  I just loved that when I ran across it: &quot;the marijuana tense&quot;.  Amis' reviews are alive, vital, and vivid.<br />They are also quite obsessive; his obsessions can be seen quite clearly.  Repeatedly, he references: the affective fallacy, the intentional fallacy, the artist manque; his pet peeves concerning writers, which include their lack of talent, their inability to control syntax, their ignorant repetition, and, of course, their use of cliches; his own canon of literary greatness, against which all is to be measured, that includes Saul Bellow, John Updike (with reservations at times), Philip Larkin, J.G. Ballard, and literature's &quot;'complete' player&quot; Vladimir Nabokov.<br />The Nabokov obsession may one day ruin Amis.  He just can't get the great Russian writer out of his head.  A quick check of the index shows that references to Nabokov appear on 51(!) of the book's 490 pages.  He notes on one hand that the word 'Kafkaesque' is losing meaning due to overuse, but with the other hand he does the same thing to the word 'Nabokovian'.  It should be no surprise, then, that the collection's last and longest piece is a deconstruction of &quot;Lolita&quot; so brilliant that it almost made me want to read that distressing book once more.<br />I adore Amis.  His writing is challenging and thought-provoking, while providing a portal to the world of this curmudgeonly, crusty, snobby author (those are all compliments, I assure you).  He's opinionated, and more than able to draft persuasive arguments to prove his opinions correct.  And last, but certainly not least, he loves writers and he loves readers.  If you are a serious member of either club, I'll bet that you'll love Amis too.	2002-02-08
US	49333751	R1BXK11IWOJ1TK	9994758845	951028418	Brideshead Revisited	Books	3	14	32	N	N	Arcadian Wonders and Brideshead Blunders	Okay, maybe 'blunders' is a harsh word.  How about 'misfires'?  That's probably more accurate.<br />I am not nearly qualified to give Evelyn Waugh advice on how to write. But I will anyway: Please, Mr. Waugh, stick to cute satire, and leave the romance fiction to the less acute; make the books more mordant than maudlin; model \\"The Loved One\\", which was far better than this tale of loved ones.<br />My main complaint is that Waugh here comes off as little more than a poor man's Oscar Wilde. You have a proliferation of aesthete's epigrams (\\"Oh, Charles, don't be such a tourist. What does it matter when it was built, if it's pretty?\\"), the crypto-homoeroticism (actually, it's not that well hidden at all), and various variations on Dorian Gray's syndrome. But where Wilde's writing revels in its formulas and in it's decadence, Waugh doesn't appear to be having very much fun.<br />The first half begins well enough. Charles Ryder, a cipheric army captain, happens on Brideshead Castle after a lengthy absence. It, and its occupants, defined his youth, and the sight of it forces forward a flood of memories. The remainder of the novel takes place within these memories, Ryder mainly acting as observer of those around him. He is a fine narrator, allowing equal time to the objective and subjective aspects of his memory (i.e., the events as they happened vs. his reactions to said events). <br />While at Oxford, his chief subject is Sebastian Flyte, a charming dipsomaniac. Sebastian is Charles' best and only friend, while being his 'in' to Brideshead. He's an addictively self-destructive character, still in love with his childhood (a teddy-bear named Aloysius goes with him everywhere; he adores his old nanny), which eventually leads to his own undoing. It's typical of the novel that when Sebastian's immature drunkenness rears its ugly head, one of his school chums casually remarks: \\"How boring!\\" Charles' days at Oxford are the novel's high points, as the charming and intriguing people he meets form a peculiar tapestry. It was a true pleasure to read the first hundred or so pages, as Waugh appears on top of his game.<br />Unfortunately, Oxford days are abandoned in the novel's second half, and the narrative flounders under the weight of 'big ideas'. While the residents of Brideshead are no less fascinating than the Oxford boys (as Sebastian accurately says: \\"I'm not going to have you [Charles] get mixed up with my family. They're so madly charming.\\"), the harsh melodrama that ensues got on my nerves. And, ultimately, Waugh never gives his characters anything cohesive to do; episodes drag on much too long, wearing out their welcome long after any relevant point has been made. Take his treatment of Lady Marchmain, Brideshead's matriarch, and a devout Catholic. A side comment by (her daughter) Cordelia epitomizes her mother's character:<br />\\"I sometimes think when people wanted to hate God they hated mummy... She was saintly but she wasn't a saint. No one could really hate a saint, could they? They can't really hate God either. When they want to hate Him and his saints they have to find something like themselves and pretend it's God and hate that.\\"<br />Out of the mouths of babes, no? Cordelia (read: Waugh) crystallizes in that one speech all the problems that religion has brought to the novel's second half. It's typical of the kind of sharp writing Waugh excels at. But the effect is diluted when the argument is repeated, in various forms, ad nauseam. It got to be quite tedious.<br />Charles, at one point, pledges to only live in a world of three-dimensions, that he can experience with his five senses. He soon he finds out that artifice rules the day, especially at Brideshead Castle, and such a world doesn't exist. I'd expected Waugh to pounce all over this idea with his sharp pen and sharper mind. But instead he revels in Charles' overwrought sincerity. Waugh's pointed wit usually punctures holes in stuffy characters such as these, but here he is content to just create them.<br />While in arcadian Oxford, \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" shines, enough that I can offer a marginal recommendation. Once it leaves that idyllic setting, Waugh gets rusty.	2002-02-03
US	49333751	R3OYIBEXHXODMA	0375704027	339664983	Norwegian Wood	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Isn't it good?	\\"Now... I realize that all I can place in the imperfect vessel of writing are imperfect memories of imperfect thoughts.\\"  This is how Haruki Murakami, through the voice of his noble narrator Toru Watanabe, begins \\"Norwegian Wood\\".  It is a poignant beginning; one that brings into question the factuality of all that follows, but not necessarily the feeling. <br />This is the second of Murakami's books that I've read.  The first, \\"A Wild Sheep's Chase\\" lost me in its allegorical approach to the existential detective novel.  \\"Norwegian Wood\\", while a much more straightforward and accessible a narrative, is no less complex.<br />Although written in Japanese, you'd never know it.  Jay Rubin's translation is seamless, capturing Murakami's easy dialogue effortlessly.  The writing really shines through.  As do Murakami's rhetorical techniques, which include using personal letters to get past what would be a lot of lengthy exposition.  Usually I find this technique distasteful and lazy, but Murakami's letters are so skillfully economical and honest (not to mention woven consistently into the narrative) that I found it to be a rather effective technique.  And his powers of language are staggering, so much so that he manages to make tired cliches seem robust.  He even trumps the saccharine 'box of chocolates' simile from \\"Forrest Gump\\", coming up with an analogy of his own that is not only clever, but also relevant and original.<br />It also helps that for Western audiences, Murakami is unexpectedly accessible, as American music and American literature dominate his thoughts.  This gives the novel (like all of Murakami's novels, from what I understand) an almost paradoxical feel for Western readers.  I found myself skipping along, feeling as if the story was set in Berkley during the late 1960's, but then every once and a while Japanese culture will jump up; after a touch of vertigo, you realize just how transcultural the East has become.<br />Another of the novel's major themes, and definitely its most powerful, is the notion, often repeated, \\"death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life.\\"  Watanabe appears to have the Midas touch; only when he comes in contact with people, they don't turn to gold, they die.  Sometimes it feels like Murakami is chronicling the genocide of a sensitive subculture of 1960's Japanese youths.  Fortunately, death is never exploited.  Well, sometimes it's used as a device to jumpstart the narrative, but Murakami has such sensitivity in his writing that it never feels cheap.<br />Murakami's greatest feat is his spare recounting of college dormitory life.  It's rendered realistically, providing a setting for much of Watanabe's ennui.  He even notes at one point that college is nothing more than a \\"period of training in techniques for dealing with boredom.\\"  Luckily, Watanabe gets a lot of mileage out of the people he meets in his dorm.  A fastidious roommate, a lecherous friend, and others provide a menagerie of minor characters who revolve around the story's periphery, reflecting back at Watanabe certain aspects of his personality that he may not want to see.<br />In Watanabe, Murakami has created a terrifically grounded narrator.  He is frank and plainspoken, to such an extreme degree that the people he knows keep commenting on it.  He lacks pretension and ego, while constantly in a mode of observing.  In many senses, he is a perfect narrator.  Thankfully he fulfills that duty, because as a character you'd almost never notice him.  He goes through periods where he's a cipher, and then through periods where his low-key charisma inexplicably attracts a number of beautiful, iconoclastic girls.  It appears that you have to be tuned to a specific, underground radio station to really appreciate Watanabe.  He's like a secret club that only attracts people who are \\"kinda weird and twisted and drowning\\".  I dug him.<br />The bulk of the novel is taken up with Watanabe's relationships with two of these weird and twisted characters.<br />Midori, a fellow student, is a whirlwind of unbridled curiosity and unchecked ego, especially when the topic is sex.  She's also funny, charismatic, sad, immature, dramatic, passionate, and highly emotional.  She challenges Watanabe, and is successful in bringing him out of his shell.  I found myself rooting for Midori to be the one that Watanabe chooses for love; but in the end Murakami makes you realize that love is not a voluntary thought, and that the \\"choice\\" is never that easy.<br />Instead, Watanabe is obsessed with Naoko, the girlfriend of his dead best friend.  Their love affair is always tenuous, and kind of creepy in its necrophilia.  Naoko is tortured and troubled and sad.  It's hard to decide if she never really loves Watanabe, or is just incapable of love.  Murakami never provides easy answers when dealing with her situation.  In that way she becomes not only the most real but also the most frustrating character in the book.  What does Watanabe see in her?  I'll never know, but I certainly recognize his reactions to a transcendent feeling.<br />Naoko also provides the book's title.  She loves the Beatles' song 'Norwegian Wood' because it \\"can make me feel so sad.  I don't know, I guess I imagine myself wandering in a deep wood.  I'm all alone and it's cold and dark, and nobody comes to save me.  That's why Reiko never plays it unless I request it.\\"  Reiko, Naoko's roommate, in a typical moment of wit, comments that it \\"Sounds like Casablanca!\\"  This is typical Murakami: positioning gentle emotional epiphanies against modern, pop-culture obsessed observations.  It's a style that certainly makes this book, on the surface morbid and forlorn, addictively readable.	2002-01-24
US	49333751	R26EITD22RQ6EX	0375757511	622445077	Life Stories: Profiles from The New Yorker (Modern Library Paperbacks)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Profiles from (and of) The New Yorker	It is expected that the profiles contained herein are what they are: insightful, well-written vignettes of interesting, often celebrated, lives.  What isn't expected, and what I found most appealing, is that the collection achieves a certain unity, a distinct flow, from one profile to the next.  It makes the reading experience less like an irrelative tour through a picture gallery, and more like a deconstruction of the human community.<br />Not willing to arrange this &quot;greatest hits&quot; package chronologically, editor David Remnick structures the book to create pregnant dichotomous pairings.  In some cases they are rather obvious, as Mikhail Baryshnikov follows Isadora Duncan.  But in other cases, the order enhances both pieces:  A dissection of a man passing himself off as a descendant of the Romanoff's is followed by one of Anatole Broyard, a black literary critic trying to pass himself off as white.  These two pieces, which on their own didn't hold my attention, came into full view once I'd read both (furthermore, Broyard is followed by Floyd Patterson, much reviled by Muhammad Ali for being a black boxing champion easily digested by white audiences).<br />Connections are made in other ways.  Roger Angell's piece on Pittsburgh Pirate Steve Blass is followed by a profile of legendary New Yorker editor Katherine White, Angell's mother.  The outcome of the 2000 U.S. Presidential election is made more palatable -- in hindsight -- by back-to-back profiles on Bush and Gore, both done by Nicholas Lemann.  And a fascinating troika of profiles -- on Johnny Carson, Marlon Brando, and Richard Pryor -- pull along the notion that reaching the heights of ones profession, in the field of entertainment, does not necessarily bring peace of mind (furthermore, profiles on Carson, Pryor, and Roseanne Barr advance my own hypothesis that a comedian must lead the life of a Cassandra for a while, before the spoils come to ruin them for good; Carson is said to have &quot;painted himself not into a corner but onto the top of a mountain.&quot;).<br />At times, the book takes on a secondary function: detailing the lengthy and lofty history of The New Yorker magazine itself.  Following the life of Katherine White, and her correspondences with New Yorker founder Harold Ross, made Nancy Franklin &quot;giddy with a feeling of discovery, as if I'd suddenly hit upon the structure of The New Yorker's DNA -- almost as if I'd been present at the creation.&quot;  This is a fantasy that others appear to share.  Remnick admits that an early skewering of Time publisher Henry Luce (itself a marvel of gymnastic prose) was in response to Time giving the same treatment to Ross.  At many other times throughout the collection, a subject is caught recognizing the magazine's reputation, making the accuracy of the profile presented (in Heisenbergian lingo) quite uncertain.  More often than not, though, the author presciently notes when this has happened.<br />So hermetically, the collection works.  Now let me note a few of its high points.<br />Mark Singer's illumination of sleight-of-hand master Ricky Jay portrays the man (who I'd only known as an enjoyable bit player in David Mamet's movies) as a tireless perfectionist, an undiscovered genius, and an unabashed curmudgeon.  It is a treat to follow Jay through his magical world, and hear of his principled theories.  Richard Preston spent many uncomfortable hours in a hot, cramped New York apartment, in order to bring back a fascinating portrait of Gregory and David Chudnovsky.  The brothers, obsessed with finding the meaning of Pi (to the point where they've built their own supercomputer out of FedExed spare parts!), engage in myopic dialogues with each other that Preston only has to present verbatim to complete his profile.  And in one of the few profiles of non-celebrities, Adam Gopnik hilariously recounts a five-year relationship with his shrink.  It's simple, riotously funny, and at times quite poignant.<br />&quot;Life Stories&quot; has few missteps (most notable: Janet Malcolm's piece on the '80s wunderkind painter David Salle tries too hard to be a piece of postmodern art itself; its efforts ultimately proved distracting).  It is a mostly precise retelling of the lives of some of this century's most interesting people.  It's urbane, without ever being excessively insular, and will be easily enjoyed by even those who've never folded over the pages of the magazine from whence it came.	2002-01-22
US	49333751	R3VHAIM0J08FKP	0451163966	808414399	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Books	5	9	9	N	N	The Bull Goose Looney vs. The Combine	Ken Kesey's great accomplishment here is that he's brought a grand sense of authority to this book.  He worked for a spell at a similar mental hospital in Oregon, even going so far as to subject himself to shock treatments.  These experiences allowed him to add authentic detail to his world, such as the classification of the patients as Chronics, Acutes, Walkers, Wheelers, and, most ominously, Disturbed.  The lucid descriptions he provides of each phylum are heartbreaking.  Life in his ward world is made up of mindless repetition and routine, where patients are watched over by hapless staff, and institutionalized racism is never given a second thought.  All of these aspects of the hospital work together to provide a nifty little microcosm of a radicalized 1960's America.<br />Much of the novel is internalized.  Chief Bromden, our humble narrator, begins life as a deaf and dumb Chronic.  Only he's got a secret (I'll never tell).  The story, as told from the Chief's point of view, is disjointed and fragmented.  This is not an ineffective technique, however.  In fact, it helps bring the reader into the mind of the insane, because as the Chief suffers through his hallucinations, we get to suffer along with him.  Kesey, to his credit, never goes overboard with the Chief's dreamlike states.  He works hard to keep the Chief's meanderings intelligible, always getting back to the story just in time before he lost the reader completely in that mania.  He lets the Chief reign himself in if only to provide lucid commentary on the events at the hospital.  This duality, this schizophrenia, makes the Chief one of the great unreliable narrators of the postmodern age.  He's not consciously covering his tracks to make himself look better.  He really believes the things he says, even if the reader can't fully.  &quot;[What follows is] the truth,&quot; he says early on.  &quot;Even if it didn't happen.&quot;<br />The real strength of &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; is that it not only givesus a strong internal narrative, but the external one is pretty strong as well.  Otherwise it would have made for a pretty convoluted movie.  Most novels do one well but not the other.<br />The reason that the external portions are strong is that they're anchored on the fate of a truly memorable literary character: Randall Patrick McMurphy.  McMurphy, a former work farm employee just new to the hospital, is a more complex character than I thought he'd be.  I was expecting from him only unbridled, ego-less action.  Instead, he was also quite focused, rational, and well thought out (listen to him cut through Harding's bull, with his neat &quot;'peckin' party&quot; analogy).  This brings up one of the novel's central questions: whether or not McMurphy really should be in the asylum, or if he's just faking to get off the work farm (in fact, this question can be asked of all the novel's characters, except, of course, for the Chief.  We've been inside his head and can surely testify that not only does he have a few loose screws, but also his screwdriver is broken).  This question makes the ending all the more tragic.  I'll not give the ending away, but be aware that knowing what ultimately happens to McMurphy didn't lessen the experience for me, and it probably won't for you.  Kesey manages to hold the suspense until the reader gets there.  When he finally lets go, the shock of it hits you like a fist through a window.<br />The novel's central and scariest truth is that the system (i.e., what the Chief calls &quot;the Combine&quot;) can't be beat.  That's very much a 1960's attitude, but still relevant in contemporary culture, especially for those of us still trying to make our way in the world.  It is personified here by Nurse Ratched, who, no matter how persistent you are as an opponent, will always hold all the cards.  And the sad irony is that this fact, once known, makes McMurphy's final punishment seem more like a blessing than a curse.	2002-01-08
US	49333751	R2SS3UFV1NZFFX	0316769495	551899474	Franny and Zooey	Books	5	7	11	N	N	Running back and forth between grief and delight	A warm calm, akin to the same feeling I had while reading Herman Hesse's &quot;Siddhartha&quot;, swathed me while reading &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;.  Both books are slight in length but not in content, and deal with restless youths caught in contemplation.  &quot;Siddhartha&quot;, set in India, is a far cry from Salinger's Manhattan, but both locales appear to be appropriate settings for a search past life's phoniness, to the truths the world holds.<br />As regular readers of this space will know, among my favourite literary themes are genius, loneliness, and obsession.  &quot;Franny &amp; Zooey&quot; has all three in spades.  The seven Glass children, all of whom inform the main characters in some way or another, were all tormented by their genius.  Franny, stuck in a spiritual crisis, is only just realizing that she's alone in the world.  And Zooey appears obsessed by the idea that his family, most notably his smothering mother and his oldest two brothers, has shaped him in such a way that he can't escape himself.<br />Like Salinger's archetype angst-maestro, Holden Caulfield, Franny and Zooey both appear to be caught up in teen obsessions: questioning authority, judging those around them through a particularly narrow prism, and intent on wiling away their time caught up in self-discovery.  The startling thing, though, is that Franny and Zooey are no longer in teen angst's main demographic.  Franny, aged 20, and Zooey, 25, are adults, now.  It's comforting to know of two peers (I'm 26 at this writing) still caught up in their same youthful questions, as I am myself.  It makes me wonder if that old axiom -- &quot;If you're not a rebel by age 20, you have no heart; if you haven't sold out by age 30, you have no brain&quot; -- doesn't have to be true.  Sure, it may not lead to a productive life, and, like Franny, there may be some psychological bumps along the way.  But won't the end be much better?  Assuming the answers are forthcoming.<br />The above paragraph,although filled with self-satisfaction, can *too* be true while also being pretentious.<br />'Franny', the shorter story that begins this collection, is a startling feat.  It dances around the issue of Franny's mental breakdown, providing a multitude of clues as to why it must occur, but never knocking the reader over the head with cheap psychology.  Although not explicitly written in his voice, the story is told through the eyes of Franny's boyfriend, Lane Coutell, a shallow and pompous college student, obsessed with having a perfect night on the town with a respectable girl.  We see the signs of Franny's breakdown through Lane's narrow worldview.  Just as he doesn't understand what is happening to her, we don't either.  It's a neat little trick.<br />Upon reflection, 'Franny' can be read as a prologue to 'Zooey', which takes place once Franny has returned to her family home in New York.  Its introduction represents a neat bit of meta-fiction.  Is it or isn't Buddy Glass commenting on the events surrounding his youngest brother and sister, and their domineering mother?  Through Buddy's introduction, Salinger is able to make excuses for the rambling nature of the story to follow.  For some, it's an excuse he needs to make.  For me, I appreciate the little bit of self-reflexivity (which only really became trendy after 1955-57, the years the stories were published), but didn't need the author to warn me of his impending self-indulgence.<br />What immediately follows is a miraculous and hilarious (and quite long) sequence where Zooey is trying to take a contemplative bath, but is constantly interrupted by his mother.  Zooey is a fine creation: he has little or no ego control, spouting hateful and sarcastic rants at his mother, who may or may not deserve them.  &quot;[Buddy] does everything else Seymour ever did -- or tries to.  Why the hell doesn't he kill himself and be done with it?&quot; he asks at one point, in a furious attempt to cut to the chase, while cutting to the bone.  It's family dysfunction at it's most brutal and, frankly, most honest.<br />Zooey could have become a terribly loathsome character if he continued down this path, but he doesn't.  His scenes with Franny are touching and familiar, showing a sibling relationship at its most poignant as they try to dialogue Socratically through her problems.  There's an obvious affection between the two, and a true sense of playfulness, even in the face of trauma.  When Zooey wakes Franny from a depression induced nap, she is disoriented enough to ask why it is so sunny in the middle of the afternoon.  Zooey replies: &quot;I bring the sun wherever I go, buddy.&quot;  I just love that little line, because it manages to say so much with so little.<br />Which is, I guess, the essence of Salinger.  When one can write as economically and yet as profound as he can, I'll follow him down any path he chooses, for as long as he chooses.  In fact, I could have spent a lot more time with Franny and Zooey than he deigned to give me.	2002-01-02

The first chapter lugs along without inspiration, tepidly cataloging the unremarkable events of an unremarkable man's morning routine.  Vic Wilcox is a middle-class, managing director at a floundering casting and general engineering firm.  He works hard, and has no time for the self-serving attitudes of university people, unwilling to get their hands dirty and help revive his England's precious economy.  Vic has horrible musical tastes, favouring 1980s female yuppie soul singers (Sade, Jennifer Rush) in the privacy of his Jaguar.  Rush's song 'The Power of Love' even provides a laughable soundtrack to a cringe-worthy love scene.  This introduction is not very stimulating, and the prose and narrative techniques Lodge uses are rather amateurish.  It turns out, though, that this was Lodge's intention, for he has other tricks up his sleeve.<br />The second chapter makes it clear that Lodge, the author, is well aware of the rhetorical devices he's using, and of the expectations we have for the character(s) he's created.  It begins with a nifty bit of self-referentiality, and regular readers of this space will know of my fondness for that device.  Hopefully meta-fiction will save the day again.  The chapter introduces Robyn Penrose, a feminist literary theorist, specializing in the industrial novel of the 19th century, who, and here's a great irony, has no practical knowledge of industry whatsoever.  This is Lodge spitting in the face of his theory-minded colleagues (he spent 27 years teaching English at the University of Birmingham), stuck in their ivory towers, turning their noses up at the real world.<br />Robyn, as opposed to Vic, is a beguiling creation.  I thought she'd sustain her status as a humourless member of the intelligentsia throughout the novel, but she redeems herself about halfway through, with this startling realization: &quot;You know, there are millions of people out there who haven't the slightest interest in what we do.&quot;  She neatly articulates my longtime criticism of advanced academia: that it is incestual, masturbatory, and ill advised of the actual problems of the real world.  Robyn manages to break through its outer veneer (thanks to her participation in the Shadow Scheme, a kind of exchange program between the university and the industrial community, in which she must follow Vic around while he does his job).  Unfortunately, Lodge seems to be saying, you can't teach an old dog new tricks.  Witness a later exchange between Robyn and her brother Basil.  When told that she's writing a book, he asks, &quot;Does the world really need another book on nineteenth-century fiction?&quot;  To which she pompously replies, &quot;I don't know, but it's going to get one.&quot;  The more things change, the more they stay the same, I suppose. <br />So how does the relationship between the seemingly disparate Robyn and Vic manifest itself?  Well, it allows the novel to make a point of education's need to become more like industry in a Thatcherized England, but with comic results: One memo requests that all official university correspondences use acronyms when possible, in order to save paper.  This leads to someone reacting to a line about the proposed Shadow Scheme (&quot;The SS will advertise our willingness to inform ourselves about the needs of industry&quot;) by saying &quot;Got his own stormtroopers, now, has he?&quot;  Lodge periodically shows a neat knack for bon mots like this.  When they came up, I'd always wish he'd use them more.  It might help to bring out the hidden satirical elements of the book, and in general they would entertain the reader.  The characters' relationship also tries to make the point that maybe industry needs to become more like education, by accounting for its workers needs to be intellectually stimulated instead of giving them jobs that necessitate standing on a dirty, dark assembly line 8 hour a day.  Although, the sight of Vic trying to digest the Brontes or Tennyson puts a pin in this utopic balloon rather quickly.<br />Lodge's greatest success here is that he is able to write a kind of modern Industrial Novel, such as the ones Robyn Penrose is studying.  The concerns of the post-post Industrial Age are delineated nicely, and he manages to throw in some entertaining hanky-panky for good measure.  However, Lodge stumbles greatly with a howl-worthy ending that appears to have been written by another author entirely.  It features scenes of amateurish exposition (one character neatly ties up his own loose ends with a timely letter), and deux es machina after deux es machina.  I felt cheated, and a little frustrated, that an author of such skill and self-awareness as Lodge would so lazily end an otherwise fine novel.  Am I missing something here?  Are the final chapters meant to be ironic, poking fun at the shoddy plotting and melodrama of other books in the same vein?  I'm willing to give Lodge some benefit of the doubt on that point, but not a lot.  It's truly a pity, because he was on his way to a fine, if unspectacular book.  As it stands, it only barely deserves its passing grade.	2001-12-21
US	49333751	R23DQT770XU553	0552138916	450739532	LORDS AND LADIES : A Novel of Discworld #14	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Far from Terry's best, with but a few moments of hilarity	This is far from my favourite Pratchett fare.  It pales in comparison to the other books of his I've read, especially in direct comparison to the other Witches' adventures.  &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, which Terry proclaims in the Author's Note is prerequisite reading before delving here, was a more exciting adventure for Granny Weatherwax and her curious coven to undertake.  &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; feels like a derivative retread.  And &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, which deconstructed &quot;MacBeth&quot;, brought more insight into its Shakespearean source than this does for &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;.<br />Witness his treatment of the character of the Fool, so strong and vibrant in &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;.  He is little more than background material here, a bureaucratic imminent king, indifferent to his fiancee's perspective, and caught up in the ritual of his duty.  I suppose something could be said for the themes brought out by his transformation from Fool to King, but it didn't interest me one bit.  Except for one bit where it is discovered that the Fool, so accustomed to sleeping curled up in a ball outside the King's door, can't truly get used to his new status and thus now sleeps curled up in a ball on the other side of the door.  It's a beautiful little moment.<br />One character who does make a strong impression is second-Witch-in-command Nanny Ogg.  Her down home malapropisms and sunny (but implicitly precarious) demeanor make her a joy to read.  Late in the book, she is teamed once again with Casamunda, the self-proclaimed second greatest lover in the world and incessant liar.  Watch her skillfully fend off his advances; watch him quickly get back on the horse for another go.  I'd love to see what Pratchett could do with these two over a whole book.  It at least broke up the (soon-to-be) monotony of watching Granny Weatherwax grouch her way through another typical adventure.<br />The central conceit here is that elves, previously believed to becute and cuddly creatures in popular mythology, are really evil.  Terribly evil.  Unspeakably evil.  When elves are around &quot;life was certainly more interesting... but usually it was shorter.  And it was more colourful, if you liked the colour of blood&quot;.  Okay?  So?  I don't think Terry does much with this notion.  The elves he concocts are not frightening at all, at least in comparison to other Discworld villains.  And the final confrontation feels like every other final confrontation Granny Weatherwax has been involved in.  The lack of suspense was a surprising discovery.  To me, this is Terry's first true misstep in the Discworld series.<br />Although I thought little of the story, Terry's sense of humour remains intact.  There are many fine examples to choose from, but here are a few of my favourites:<br />.. a delicious footnote about the naming adventures of the Carter family, ends with Hope Carter becoming a depressive, while Bestiality Carter is generally kind to animals.<br />.. a word that beings with 'M', that means &quot;seein' the other person's point of view&quot;?  Empathy.<br />.. More fun with Latin: &quot;Il Porcupino Nil Sodomy Est&quot; is, I think, a nod to true hardcore Internet Pratchett fans.<br />.. the New York second (defined as the time between when the light turns green and the cab behind you honks)<br />.. &quot;Magrat says a broomstick is one of them sexual metaphor things&quot; (although this is a phallusy)<br />Terry amazes, yet again, with his verbal gymnastics.  I just wish he'd tacked them on a worthwhile story.  I guess one sub-par book in fourteen (so far) is not a bad ratio.  Don't worry about skipping &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; on your way through the Discworld catalog.  You won't miss much.	2001-12-08

Crumb Coffee Table Art Book (Kitchen Sink Press Book for Back Bay Books)	Books	4	19	21	N	N	The little guy that lives inside Crumb's brain bursts out	There's a line that R. Crumb uses twice, in two separate comics, that epitomizes the major themes of his art:  &quot;Nobody understands [me]... and of course, how could they??&quot;  Periodically his work will stumble into a pit of naval gazing and self-indulgence when it comes to the subjects for his comics.  But ultimately, everything he does boils down to this one line.  The level of self-awareness he manages to achieve with this line, and throughout the remainder of his work, is both staggering and fascinating, enough to justify the grandiosity of this book.<br />I tried to read this as an autobiography, from cover to cover, taking time to carefully understand how the context of Crumb's life affected his work.  Not an effective strategy.  If the book wasn't so cumbersome to hold, it might have worked.  But since that first reading, I've gotten much more enjoyment just laying the book open flat on a large surface, and staring at the audacious art contained herein.<br />The large-scale (13&quot;x11&quot;) format has various levels of effectiveness when presenting Crumb's work.  The sketchbook pages, when blown up to this size, lose their intimacy.  You can see the fudges and mistakes that Crumb's made.  These imperfections are beautiful in the smaller format, but become grotesque and distracting at this size.  On the other hand, too often his comic book covers should have been enlarged but weren't.  The details in the margins, brought out gloriously when they are blown up, can't be seen when the covers are presented as thumbnails.<br />Each chapter begins with a page-long, hand-written introduction by the man himself.  Robert is self-effacing to a fault; you can tell that he's embarrassed by the treatment his works have been given here.  He never intended them for such a wide audience, and now the incoherent ramblings of his inner mind are getting the coffee table book treatment!  It's preposterous!  That being said, he does a fine job trying to explain his own psychology, getting at his motivations for creating the art he did, and never apologizing for any of it.  And I found that if you read his writings while imagining that great laid-back drawl of his, the experience is that much more enjoyable.<br />The book is a perfect companion piece for anyone who's seen Terry Zwigoff's stunning documentary, &quot;Crumb&quot;.  Many of the pieces shown in that movie turn up here too, only instead of just snippets we get the whole work.  Most notable is the inclusion of &quot;A Bitchin' Bod'!&quot;, in which the notorious Devil Girl, her head removed, is given by Mr. Natural to Flakey Foont, who proceeds to defile it, only to feel terribly guilty afterwards.  This comic got the most attention from the intellectuals dissecting Crumb in the movie, and it's here in all its glory.  True, it's hideously misogynistic, but it's also a fine example of what makes Crumb's work so awe-inspiring.  He has a unique ability to mine his id for material, to lay his fantasies bare, and damn the consequences.<br />A fascinating foray into one man's artistic (and by association, personal) life, &quot;The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book&quot; would work splendidly on anyone's coffee table.  That is, if you had the nerve to actually put it on your coffee table.  If you want to freak out your friends, and educate them about the twisted depths that men's souls can achieve, you should.	2001-11-12
US	49333751	R36A1WS1GLPUWR	0061092177	497629870	Small Gods	Books	5	111	113	N	N	Oh Brutha, Where Art Thou?	The first twelve Discworld books were adolescent affairs, obsessed with corny jokes, screwball plots, and bumbling but lovable characters.  Enjoyable treats all, but in retrospect less substantial than they could have been.  &quot;Small Gods&quot;, to me, is Terry Pratchett's first 'adult' book.  The corny jokes, screwball plots, and bumbling but lovable characters are still here, but only to service a narrative soaked in significant themes and obsessed with our place in the multiverse.<br />For the most part it stands on its own as a complete story.  Except for a few notable exceptions (i.e., an appearance by the cousin of Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, a quick cameo by my all-time favourite Disc denizen The Librarian, and a couple of pregnant references to Ankh Morpork), you don't have to be Discworld savvy to follow the story.  It's set in the previously unheard of locale of Omnia, where the Quisition, led by Deacon Vorbis (as evil a character as anything Pratchett has put on paper), tortures into its heretical citizenry a belief in the Great God Om.  But the central question in the book, the one that drives the plot forward, is this: what happens when belief dissipates, and is replaced by simple routine?  Following the rituals of a religion is not really the same as believing in the power and glory of a God.<br />And on the Discworld it's not like your wanting for Gods to choose from.  There are billions of them, and they're all likely to strike you down where you stand if you insult them in any way.  Great God Om used to be the greatest of all Gods, but he's fallen on tough times.  The brand of belief favoured by Vorbis is not the kind of belief Om needs.  He's losing true believers in the process, and has become quite ineffectual.  So much so that he woke up one day to find himself in the body of a small turtle, dropped by an eagle attempting to break his shell (because, as we're constantly reminded, &quot;There's very good eating on one of these, you know&quot;).The only thing keeping Om from disappearing altogether is Brutha, an illiterate novice, who barely knows anything of the world outside the confines of his garden.<br />Brutha and Om follow a Pratchett tradition of teaming a wide-eyed innocent with a cynical curmudgeon, and watching as the two personalities eventually meet in the middle (&quot;Om, bumping along in Brutha's pack, began to feel the acute depression that steals over every realist in the presence of an optimist&quot;).  Brutha is a true believer in the face of pure evil, and it's this innocence/ignorance that allows him to survive.  Om is a perpetually pissed-off little dude, angry at his new lot in life, and unsure how to get his powers back.  All he knows is that Brutha is his only hope, for Brutha is the only one that can truly hear him.  Their joint quest is a joy to follow.<br />Along the way, we meet an eclectic cast of characters, all looking to revolt against the tyranny of Omnia, or to sit back and wait for the cards to fall where they may.  The most fun is a brief excursion to Ephebe, the Disc's Greek doppelganger.  Its philosophers are known to run through the streets dripping wet, dressed only in a towel and carrying a loofah sponge, after an Archimedes-esque &quot;Eureka&quot; moment, and it's tyrannical ruler (rightly called The Tyrant) is guarded by an impenetrable and lethal labyrinth.  Terry has much fun poking holes in this world of ideas, just as he's had poking holes in the world of beliefs.  Which is probably the greatest thing about this book.  No matter what side of the line you fall on, be it atheist, zealot, intellectual, or priest, you'll find someone/something to laugh at, and many reasons to pause for thought.<br />You'd think a book like this, thick with ideas, would be short on plot and humour.  Well, this still is a Discworld book, so it has plenty of both.  The plot moves along like a steam engine (or a steam-powered turtle), plunging Brutha and Om through danger and chaos until the fantastic denouement, which drops from the sky like some divine providence.  It's a thrilling ride and a satisfying ending.  As for the humour, Terry's remarkable wit remains intact even after thirteen entries in the series.  My favourite moments here involve faux-Latin translations, that clean up the original version with PC precision (&quot;Cuius testiculos habes, habeas cardia et cerebellum&quot; doesn't necessarily translate to &quot;When you have their full attention in your grip, their hearts and minds will follow&quot;, but the joke comes when you realize what that second Latin word must really mean).<br />&quot;Small Gods&quot; is most assuredly a parody of other sci-fi/fantasy books, just as the rest of the Discworld books have been.  But it is so much more than that.  It really does stand on its own as a perfect satire of religion, and what it means to be religious (or more simply put, to believe).  I fancied myself a fan of Terry's previous books, but have to admit that this is leaps and bounds ahead of those previous works.  And thank Om for that!	2001-10-18
US	49333751	R39GDP4IN1KBL7	0312282990	383312801	The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay	Books	5	119	134	N	N	The Real Wonder Boys	\\"A faster read than a Grisham book.   More powerful than an Oprah pick.   Able to win Pulitzer Prizes in a single bound edition.  Look!   Up on the bookshelf!   It's pulp fiction!   It's serious literature!   It's `The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay'!   Yes it's `The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay', written by a strange visitor from Pittsburgh who came to the literary world with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.  'The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay', a book that can change the course of mighty literary trends, bend public discourse in its bare hands, and which, disguised as Michael Chabon's latest novel, a mild-mannered bestseller for a great metropolitan readership, fights a never-ending battle for Truth!  Justice!  and the American Way!\\"<br />Pretty cheesy, that.  But good cheese, no?  Actually, the above is just a thinly veiled attempt to usher you into the world of super-hero comic books that Michael Chabon has created for this book.  It is a world of convenient coincidences, of nick-of-time rescues, of unbelievable happenstance, and hyper-romanticism.  It's a world whose characters are drawn in two tones (black or white), where good and evil combat in epic struggles, and little boys pay ten cents an issue to read about it.  It's an entirely made up world, embracing its own fictionality, but one that the reader can easily get lost in.  Chabon has written a book that takes the conventions of the comic book and exploits them.  If you encounter a situation here that tests the boundaries of reality, try reading it as if spread over six cheerily drawn panels.  It'll make much more sense that way.<br />The reason for this technique, if I may be so bold as to articulate it, is quite simple: Escapism.  Joe Kavalier at one point lists the reasons why he loves his comic books: \\"for their inferior color separation, their poorly trimmed paper stock, their ads for air rifles and dance courses and acne creams...\\"  But most importantly, for this young man newly escaped from occupied Prague, for the way they allowed young boys to escape from reality and dream their dreams.  It's a pretty moving message.  Joe and his cousin Sammy Clay (nee Clayman) create a comic book superhero to exploit this theme, named appropriately enough \\"The Escapist\\".  It's popularity ends up rivaling Superman and Batman.  I'm not going to tell you what Sammy is escaping from, for that would ruin one of the book's best and most tastefully portrayed surprises.<br />However, all is not painted in comic book artificiality.  In fact, much of the book's sub-text is quite poignant and real.  I mean, the book's title, which looks very comic-esque, is actually quite ironic.  The boys' adventures aren't really that amazing together (it's run-of-the-mill, everyday stuff, except for a huge joint success).  Joe has some topsy-turvy times himself, and Sammy's are more internal and domestic than anything.  Even their names are ironic.  Joe is certainly not cavalier about the cause he finds himself obsessed with.  Sammy's clay (his \\"fundamental nature or spirit\\") remains hidden for the majority of the book, only drawn out against his will.  Chabon only uses the comic book template as an easy entry point into this world.  After that, he creates some complex human situations.  And the book is set in and around a very real New York City, during its golden era.  Not only are the city's alleyways and seedy apartments and subways represented, but so are some of its most famous landmarks.  It's no coincidence that the Empire State Building stands tall and proud on the cover of the book's first paperback edition.  It plays a major role in many of the boys' \\"adventures\\".  As does the recent World's Fair, in a minor but crucial way.<br />The knock here is that Chabon's prose is a little too purple, a little too flowery, with a vocabulary that may stymie the majority of his readers.  Frankly, I've read prose infinitely more difficult.  Chabon, by comparison, is actually quite an easy, straightforward read.  And for a 600+ page book with little in the way of narrative thrust, it's quite a page-turner.  He has a sly little sense of humour, littering the text with some very silly, sarcastic moments (e.g., a brainstorming session almost ends with Kavalier &amp; Clay's super hero being called `The Mandrill', with his \\"multicolored wonder ass that he used to bedazzle opponents\\").  But for the most part the book has a very somber tone.  Before you begin, though, do yourself a favour and read up on the legend of the Golem (and not just in the Tolkien sense of the world).  It'll help you to better understand many of the book's themes.<br />Chabon has done a wonderful job mixing a lot of research on comic book history (and I mean a lot), with a fake comic book history (perfectly believable in this context), with a story about two young men trying to live the American Dream.  Don't be afraid by the book's heft; it's an exciting read, filled with suspense and cliffhanger endings, just like a real comic would be.	2001-10-16
US	49333751	R1QPEWS8UNT22Z	0380804557	26552478	Stardust	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Mr. Thron goes to Faerie: A Post-Modern Adventure	&quot;Adventures are all very well in their place but there's a lot to be said for regular meals and freedom from pain,&quot; says Tristran Thron, halfway through Neil Gaiman's neo-post-modern fairy tale adventure, &quot;Stardust&quot;.  Tristran is a self-aware, Candide-esque protagonist, innocent and wide-eyed enough to not fear the world beyond the wall of Wall, but cynical and courageous enough to make the most of his adventures there.  Sent on an almost impossible quest by the most beautiful maiden in the village, Tristran's adventures at first appear to be standard fare for heroes of his ilk.  But Gaiman has layered his story with just enough self-reflexivity and meta-fiction to appeal to the post-modern reader.<br />Thorn is aware that he is to become just like the heroes in the books he reads.  He uses this knowledge to his best advantage, and never panics in the face of grave danger (or odd predicament).  But he also falls into the same traps as those heroes he adores.  It makes for an interesting contrast.  Witness his reaction when a young lady he has captured promises to stay put if he just releases her from her chains.  Tristran knows better than to trust her, but does so anyway, for his innocence and sense of the romantic is so powerful.  It is a wonderful contradiction that Gaiman has constructed, allowing him to keep the knowing reader off-balance, asking, &quot;What is the character going to do?&quot;<br />&quot;Stardust&quot; is set in and around Victorian era England.  It is a locale that is portrayed as condemning imagination as a vice, adventure as a crime, and passion as something to frown upon.  Gaiman contrasts this with the wonderful land of Faerie, where Tristran's adventures take place, which rewards spirit, individuality, and love.  Setting the story in a non-fictional locale, and contrasting it with a hyper-fictional one serves the satire here well.  Gaiman points a magical finger at the remnants of Victorianism, and then proceeds to skewer them mercilessly.<br />As many have said here, I think that this would make fine bedtime reading for a young child.  Just make sure that said child is one of keen intelligence, is eager to learn, and unwilling to shield themselves from the horrors of the world.  This is not a fairy tale that's willing to settle for simple handholding and basic morality.  Gaiman is uncompromising in his vision of a utopian fairy world.  His ideal land has passion and romance, but also sex and tremendous violence.  It asks questions about love and death and fate that a naive youngster might find too challenging, and presents scenes of love and horror that a timid youngster will find disconcerting.<br />Gaiman is ambitious in his storytelling.  He knows the cliches of the genre he's working in, and does his best to subvert them, while keeping things simple and familiar.  Unfortunately, at times he lets the story get away from him, only to rope it in at the last moment.  His ambition sometimes outreaches his talent, but I give him credit for trying.  And even though I figured out the ending early on (c'mon, it's pretty obvious), it didn't disappoint me when it arrived.  I was satisfied almost completely by this slight but astounding little book.kewer them mercilessly.<br />As many have said here, I think that this would make fine bedtime reading for a young child.

It is a picaresque, following a band of basketball playing rogues through a series of failed attempts at keeping their sanity, led by ineffectual narrator Gyuri Fischer (whose surname indicates to me that there's something painfully biographical in this frank little book).<br />Fischer, like Vladimir Nabokov, has a foreigner's (he's Oxford educated, yes, but Hungarian through and through) joyous take on the English language, but little faculty for plot development.  The story is structured as a series of vignetted flashbacks, flitting back and then forward through the innocent days before warfare and mayhem.  Fischer writes in a tangential style, traipsing off along multiple narrative paths, but never really getting back to a central plot.  Rather, his book's spine is taken up by the theme of insanity within warfare, nihilism in the face of danger, and laughter in the face of evil.  While the narrative is less than strong, Fischer saves the book with his sparkling prose.  The man can put a sentence together that will make your eyeballs melt.  &quot;In the land of the blind,&quot; he muses through his narrator at one point, in a particularly strong example of his torrid style, &quot;the man who knows how to use the white stick is king.&quot;  Later: &quot;I know life is unfair, I don't dispute that,&quot; Gyuri would gasp, &quot;but does it really have to be this sort of industrial strength unfair?&quot;  The sprightly jocularity that so characterized the other works of Fischer's I've read is nearly missing here, replaced by a melancholy that is at once humourous (Fischer, if nothing else, has to laugh to keep himself from crying) while also being smotheringly depressing.<br />Fischer takes an interesting tact when dealing with the horrors of war.  It is all presented rather matter-of-factly, filtered through the cynical eyes of Gyuri and his basketball playing buddies (on a side note, the basketball scenes were a treat to read, but there weren't as many as advertised; this was one of my biggest disappointments with the book).  Best bud Pataki is an especially wonderful creation, a prodigious athlete who doesn't need to practice, but is full of passion and apathy and biting humour.  I'd rush out and buy a sequel made up only of Pataki stories.<br />The strongest part of the book, in my mind, is Gyuri's burgeoning love affair with an oblivious young radical.  Fischer's writing at this point is vibrant, expressive, and painful.  Jadwiga and Gyuri's romance, while never coming to full fruition, would work on its own.  With the impending revolution as a backdrop, it becomes even more poignant.  This is some of Fischer's strongest writing.<br />Without the benefit of any historical knowledge regarding Hungary in the late 1940s and early 1950s, I was quite lost at times understanding the political context that the characters were struggling to comprehend.  It's a period not dealt with during my liberal Canadian education.  Does that make the happenings minor?  Well, before I'd read &quot;Under the Frog&quot;, my answer would have been 'yes'.  Now, I'm not so sure.  Fischer imbues his book with such weight and relevance that you can't help but feel otherwise.	2001-09-24
US	49333751	R2AYBWJPOY0SDG	0375703195	153123734	Which Lie Did I Tell?: More Adventures in the Screen Trade	Books	5	37	39	N	N	How to get the toys over the mountain	William Goldman's follow-up to &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot; follows much the same form as that book.  It's intended for an audience of prospective Hollywood screenwriters, but can be equally enjoyed by those interested in frank Hollywood gossip and tales from an insider.  Goldman is a perfect tour guide across this terrain, for he loves to teach from his experiences, and is an entertaining and economical writer.  Most of this book feels like a private chat with a friendly old uncle who's lead an exciting and adventure filled life.<br />Goldman starts by revisiting a successful section from his earlier memoir: anecdotes from his experiences writing his most recent work.  Tales of adapting his own &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, his love for the material and for Andre the Giant; the good intentioned but eventual failures of &quot;The Year of the Comet&quot; and &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; (the latter is a good example of how the material can get away from the writer once an egotistical star is on board, in this case Michael Douglas); and how he went about adapting &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;Absolute Power&quot;.  This last example was my favourite, for even though the book it's based on was pulp, and movie barely registered, Goldman uses it as a fine example on the problems of adapting, and how you need to be ruthless just to make the thing work.  He takes you through his process step-by-step, and the parts where he's racking his brain on how to make the sucker work are tangible in their frustration.  Also, there were some nifty Clint Eastwood moments that make you respect the Man with No Name even more.<br />The second section takes a look at several of Goldman's favourite film scenes (from a screenwriter's point of view), and proposes to analyze why they worked.  While his passion for these moments is palpable, Goldman skimps on the analysis.  Why was the zipper scene in &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; so effective?  Why does thechess scene in &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; resonant still?  He does a fine job, though, finding the importance of the cliff scene from &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;.  But then he should know that one inside out, because he wrote it (Warning: if you have never seen or do not at all appreciate &quot;Butch and Sundance&quot;, I'd stay away from this book; Goldman has enthusiastic affection for his first big hit, and returns to it often for examples; I myself love the movie and was glad to read more about it).  The best part of this section is his attempt to wrestle credit for the crop-duster scene in &quot;North by Northwest&quot; from Alfred Hitchcock, and give it to the screenwriter, Ernest Lehman.  I was convinced.<br />The third section offers the reader a chance to be screenwriter.  Goldman presents several newspaper clippings as examples of possible source material for an original screenplay.  He then takes us through the process of molding and shaping the materiel to the demands of the screen.  It's pedantic Goldman at his best.<br />In the final section, Goldman presents an original screenplay he's written to various professional screenwriters, to show the function of a &quot;script doctor&quot; (Goldman's latest and most notorious Hollywood incarnation).  The screenplay he's written, a tired detective adventure called &quot;The Big A&quot;, is still in process, and it's a treat reading Goldman thinking out loud.  He doesn't know where to go with the story at some points, and presents the reader with various possibilities.  He's unsure about a scene he's just written, and admits to its inadequacies.  He's having problems with character, and admits to that too.<br />But Goldman is not nearly as hard on himself as those he's solicited for help are.  This was my favourite section of the book.  On the one hand, the submissions he's received are biting, witty, and malicious in the most entertaining of ways.  On the other hand, they full of a variety of great ideas, all of which would turn &quot;The Big A&quot; into a bona fide movie.  Tony Gilroy (who wrote &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;) is particularly effective on both of these fronts; his writing is lovable curmudgeonry at its best.<br />If Goldman ever decides to finish off this trilogy, I'll be right there waiting.  Whether in narrative prose or memoir form, his writing is easily digestible, fun, and most importantly, informative.  He wears his passions on his sleeve, and invites the reader to do the same.  I was right there with him the whole time, lapping up his nuggets of wisdom.  I guess the best praise I have is that everytime I finish a Goldman book, I get the itch to go write a screenplay myself.  And feel perfectly equipped to do so.	2001-09-16
US	49333751	R2MBN60AMPM0Q	0375705503	776660814	England, England	Books	4	5	8	N	N	A utopia/dystopia unto itself	This is my first trip through Barnes' oeuvre.  I arrived believing him to be a more focussed but less talented and bitter version of Martin Amis.  For once, the advanced hype was right.  Not that being a low-rent Amis clone is anything to be ashamed of (and he's not really that, but it makes for an easy analogy), for Amis sets the bar so high, that anyone falling just short is really doing something quite good.  Barnes is at that.<br />The book begins with a wonderful, almost tangential look at the childhood of our &quot;heroine&quot;, Martha Cochrane.  This section could have been set off by itself, and turned into a ripping good short story.  We see her run-ins with a virtuoso bean grower at the county fair, a touching sequence where her Dad teases her by hiding one piece of a puzzle she's working on (it's a map of England, natch), and then an even more touching scene with her mother after said Dad has skipped town without a word.  This section, while standing firmly on its own, also nicely sets up the themes of the rest of the book.<br />And that rest of the book is dominated by one Sir Jack Pitman, deity of Multi-national Corporation Pitco, raving patriot, and mastermind behind the Island of the book's title.  Jack is a wonderful creation, all brash ego and blowhard posturing.  He is at once supremely self-aware, and easily manipulated by his underlings, whom all know how to subtly push his buttons to give him what he wants and to get what they want.  Witness him question his right hand man, a yes-man to the core, on Sir Jack's distaste for yes-man.  The right hand man knows better and answers all questions in the negative.  Sir Jack, bless his heart, chuckles, for he knows he's being had and adores the effort.<br />The middle section, and to a lesser degree the end, functions as a great piece of utopia/dystopia literature.  Utopia, for the Island version of England Pitco has created is meant to be ideal; the perfect tourist locale, where all the tourist sightsand attractions you want to see are within walking distance of each other.  Dystopia, for the government and the monarchy, which in theory should look out for the rights of its citizens, has been replaced by a corporation, which in theory looks out for no other interests but its own (&quot;[the Island is] a locus of uncluttered supply and demand... to gladden the heart of Adam Smith&quot;).  I am a sucker for utopias and dystopias (Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;; Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot;; Thomas More's &quot;Utopia&quot;; Samuel Butler's &quot;Erewhon&quot;), and Barnes doesn't disappoint with his creation of England's more efficient doppelganger.  It's Old England crossed with Disneyland, wherein Anglo stuffiness is satired alongside North American intolerance.  Capitalism, the monarchy, historical revisionism, and human all nature all take their turn through the ringer of this simulacrum.  My one complaint, and this is not Barnes' fault but my own, is that the story was sometimes too Anglo-centric.  I suppose someone with a greater knowledge of English customs and history will appreciate the jokes here more than I did.  Still, Barnes' provided enough for even I to enjoy.<br />On top of (or rather underneath) all this England bashing (&quot;from now on, only those with an active love of discomfort and necrophiliac taste for the antique need venture there&quot;), Barnes also throws in an effective little love story.  Martha and Paul (who's employed as Sir Jack's &quot;ideas catcher&quot;) meet, fall in love, and go through tumultuous times as they try to keep their professional and private lives separate.  The questions each pose to the other, and to themselves, are frank, sincere, and provocative.  Each is insecure for various reasons, and Barnes probes these problems effectively.<br />The epilogue chapter, while wondrously biting, cynical, and skeptical about the fate of England if things keep going as they are, was not as effective.  Basically, Barnes scraps the tone and style of the rest of the book, and presents us with a rambling, stream-of-conscience tour through England, England's aftermath.  I could see what Barnes was trying to do; I just didn't enjoy it.  In the preceding chapters I was with him all the way, marveling at his talent for prose and ideas, and enjoying the heck out of both.	2001-09-08
US	49333751	R18Y4GMY5AJI1A	0552134651	532931410	Witches Abroad	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Pratchett waves his magic wand again	The first half of &quot;Witches Abroad&quot; bored me silly.  &quot;Has Terry lost the magic touch?&quot; I thought to myself.  What should have been another merry romp through the lives of Mesdames Weatherwax, Ogg, and Garlick begins as a tired series of fairy tale parodies.  What gives?<br />Poor me, should have known better.  Terry always has something up his sleeve.<br />The second half makes his intentions crystal clear.  &quot;Witches Abroad&quot; is a story about... stories!  The parodies that bothered me so were just there to set up the drama of the second half.  &quot;There's always a happy ending,&quot; someone remarks at some point.  But the ending is only happy if you're one of the good guys.  And how do you really know if you're the good guys?  An encounter with an evil fairy godmother -- intent on bending the stories of life to suit her will -- brings all of these questions to light.<br />A return to the adventures of this Crazy Coven of witches is always welcome, &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; being one of my favourite entries in the Discworld catalog.  Once again, they do not disappoint.  Granny Weatherwax is as crusty and single-minded as ever, but is given a dimension of caring and sympathy that we haven't seen before.  And her actions in the final battle (c'mon, you knew there had to be a final battle) are noble, a grand feat of self-sacrifice in the face of ever increasing odds against her.  Nanny Ogg, the wise but muddled mother figure, has more choice moments here than ever before.  My favourite being her periodic letterS home, detailing her exploits in foreign parts (one such letter describes an encounter with a &quot;banananana dakry&quot;; a footnote explains that Nanny knows how to spell banana, she just doesn't know when to stop).  That Nanny's a trip.  Magrat Garlick, the youngest of the coven, mainly plays the straight man opposite her more mature sisters, but she has a solid head on her shoulders, and is usually the one who keeps the others out of hot-headed trouble.<br />Terry offers a treat to loyal Discworlders, in the return of Death.  He doesn't make a big splash, and if you hadn't met him before you may not recognize his intentions.  But his few simple scenes put a smile on my face, especially the final encounter, which is as beautiful and solemn as anything Terry's written before.  It's worth the price of admission on its own.  The rest of the book, even though it takes a while to get there, is a great example of what makes the Discworld books so much fun: dollops of humour, tough questions, and satisfying conclusions.	2001-08-21
US	49333751	R1PPWZNEXHOVND	0380973464	555229230	Cryptonomicon	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Gold is where you find it	I came to \\"Cryptonomicon\\" assuming that its pages held a healthy mixture of math and literature, the two arts my brain appears most suited to.  I discovered in the end that, frankly, there wasn't enough math for my tastes (a partial understanding of high school algebra and calculus is enough for you to get by), and the literature started out sloppy and unfocused.  But in the end these two disciplines converged to make a most satisfying whole. <br />There is so much here to sink your teeth into.  It's quite dense, with a flurry characters, geographies, contexts, and cryptographs.  I got lost along the way on many occasions.  My suggestion to any prospective reader would be to find something tangible to latch on to early on (I did my best to let Randy Waterhouse, a most sympathetic \\"crypto-hero\\", be my guide), and go along for the ride.  And don&#8217;t try and decipher (pun intended) every meticulously crafted detail.  Go for the big picture and you'll do fine.<br />The sections set during present day, with Randy Waterhouse and his buddies trying to get their latest business venture (a data haven in the Philippines) off the ground, were fascinating, especially near the end when we are hurtling along with him to the book&#8217;s final mystery.  The other main narrative thrusts, set during WWII, were hit and miss.  These sections are finely written, never skimping on the gore with a tasteful war-is-hell kind of presentation, but ultimately left me empty.  Gung-ho jarhead Bobby Shaftoe, the focus of these sections, was probably my least favourite of the book&#8217;s main characters.  Which is odd because author Neal Stephenson has admitted that Bobby was the character he most enjoyed writing.<br />Thankfully, Stephenson has populated his semi-fictional world with a menagerie of fascinating characters.  Besides the aforementioned Randy Waterhouse, we have his grandfather Lawrence, a pioneer of computer technology.  There's also: Avi, Randy's friend and business partner in the data haven, who happens to be a raving anti-holocaust fanatic; Goto Dengo, an engineer whose purpose I am loathe to spoil here (pay close attention to this guy); Enoch Root, a priest who serves as the main link between the past and the present; and the aptly named Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe, a fiery Vietnam vet.  Stephenson even allows some real life characters to intrude on the proceedings, including the aforementioned Gen. (\\"I shall return\\") MacArthur, and computer godfather Alan Turing.<br />The sparse romantic elements, with Randy pursuing the ridiculously named America \\"Amy\\" Shaftoe, felt tacked on.  Although they did provide an opportunity for a hilarious climb through her family tree, Amy was little more than a token female in what amounted to an all boys club.<br />For a writer who's basically a (self-proclaimed) computer geek, Stephenson has an obvious flair for inventive prose.  An example of this comes in a long paragraph that describes the chemical makeup of the human bodies in a room (it is long, detailed, and also funny), which concludes by saying that even though there are all these biological moving parts, no one makes a sound.  Another quotation from the same scene, concerning Randy's assessment of a dour group of prospective business partners, is almost Tom Robbins-esque:  &#8220;&#8230; the Chinese guys [look] like the contents of Madame Tussaud&#8217;s Dumpster after an exhibit on the Cultural Revolution\\".  My favourite Stephenson invention is a shorthand quip shared between a concerned Avi and Randy.  They classify their situation as \\"the most cigarettes\\", a truncated version of \\"we could end up in prison married to the guy with the most cigarettes.\\"  Proof positive that Stephenson is a talented and entertaining writer.<br />Stephenson gets a lot of mileage (and exposition of ideas) out of Socratic discourse.  In one of my favourite sections, Enoch Root schools Randy on the progress of humanity while Randy asks pertinent questions.  The conversation centres on Greek mythology, the Titanomachia, Athena (the goddess of technology), and how those with intelligence and cunning [Metis] will out do those with power in times of warfare, for they will have the ability to develop better technology.  It could have been dry and dull, but there is such passion contained within the discourse that the words jumped from the page with exuberance.<br />The novel's first two-thirds finds Stephenson struggling to keep a coherent narrative structure intact.  I don't think he was necessarily successful, and have a hunch he didn't think so either.  He tries to confuse his readers by surprising us with cliffhanger endings to many chapters, in lieu of strong narrative development.  However, once he got his feet, Stephenson saves the day with a fine final third, which had a superb narrative thrust racing towards the end.  And even though the ending was wrapped up haphazardly, Stephenson had done enough right by then to earn the book a positive place in my memory.	2001-08-16
US	49333751	R2OAQFUX6TGVSN	0553348981	919939441	Jitterbug Perfume	Books	5	5	6	N	N	The Beet Generation	Imagine an entire novel whose narrative is built around the aroma of the beet.  Don't need to imagine it, friend.  Tom Robbins has written that novel.  And boy is it fun.<br />Structurally, the narrative is brilliant.  Brief trips through the present (geographically Seattle, Paris and New Orleans set the scene) sandwich prolonged trips through the distant past.  Alobar, King of Bohemia nearly a thousand years ago, is to be put to death when the first signs of old age's feebleness show themselves.  He flees, not because he is scared of Death; he just doesn't agree with the way Death does His business.  Alobar's adventures lead him on a sprawling globetrotting quest to find immortality, accompanied by a like-minded female companion, the exiled Indian aromatist Kudra.  Their adventures are mystical, philosophical, beautiful, and poetic.<br />Running along side these adventures -- in contemporary times -- are the everyday lives of three perfumers.  Marcel &quot;Bunny&quot; LeFever is the man behind the nose behind one of Paris' most successful perfumeries.  His eccentricities are legendary, such as wearing a whale mask when contemplating his next scent.  Lily Devalier (and her apprentice, V'Lu Jackson) run a small but respected perfume shoppe in New Orleans.  &quot;Genius Waitress&quot; Priscilla Partido works at a Mexican Restaurant where she is constantly fending off the lesbian advances of bartender Ricki.  At night, she retires to her flat for experiments in perfume chemistry.  These three stories, seemingly connected by a diaphanous thread, have more in common than you'd think.  And just who is leaving beets on all of their doorsteps?  Hmm...<br />This is all a finely crafted excuse for some lengthy (but not too lengthy) philosophical discussion on the nature of immortality, and some seriously gifted wordplay.  As in most of Tom's books, there are a plethora of inspired metaphors sprinkled throughout the action; some that make your jaw drop in jealous wonder.  Please enjoy two of my favourites:<br />\\"She realized with a shock that she was so wet that children could have sailed toy boats in her underpants\\" (a fine example of Tom's freedom when it comes to subjects of a sexual nature; there is some truly lascivious stuff here).<br />\\"The Middle Ages hangs over history's belt like a beer belly.  It is too late now for aerobic dancing or cottage cheese lunches to reduce the Middle Ages.  History will have to wear size 48 shorts forever.\\"<br />Ahh!  Aren't they beautiful?<br />\\"Jitterbug Perfume\\" is one of my favourite Robbins masterpieces (\\"Another Roadside Attraction\\" being the other).  It takes a ridiculously simple yet puzzling concept, and weaves magic from its loom.  I am powerless to do anything but grin mightily whenever I am within its pages.<br />However...<br />I've said it many a time before, but I feel it bears repeating: Tom Robbins is most definitely an acquired taste.  If you run into Tom, and are put off the first time, please try try again.  Imagine the virgin Robbins reader, treading through the first couple pages here, baffled by all this talk about beets.  And, on a more general level, confounded by the story's unwillingness to get itself rolling.  Be patient.  Eventually, Tom will make clear the reason for the beets.  Crystal clear.  And his way with story, which I admit is most often meandering, is also quite original.  He gets where he wants to go (and where you, the reader want him to go) eventually.  And when he does, it's more satisfying.	2001-07-17
US	49333751	R3N0E5ATHVWP8D	0316925195	200852558	Brief Interviews with Hideous Men	Books	3	93	116	N	N	If it truly was 'Brief' it might have been good	A &quot;brief&quot; history of my relationship with David Foster Wallace's oeuvre is necessary, before I discuss the book in question:<br />I devoured &quot;The Broom of the System&quot;, finding its characters, situations, and storytelling unique and enthralling.  Although I was upset by it's ending (or lack thereof), I assumed it would be a good warm-up for &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;.  Wrong!  So far, I've made two passes at that behemoth tome.  The second time I even made it to page 200 before stopping in frustration.  So when approaching &quot;Brief Interviews&quot;, I was hoping for more &quot;Broom&quot; than &quot;Jest&quot;.  Wrong!<br />In reading &quot;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&quot; one notices the extent that Wallace fancies himself the ultimate postmodern author.  If you were to describe to me the style he uses here, I'd have to say: &quot;Wow, what a neat idea!  Challenge and frustrate the reader with unreadable prose, paragraphs that go on for pages and pages without a break, and endless footnotes that go on in infinite detail about the same mundane topic discussed in the body of the text!  Genius!&quot;<br />That's all well and good in theory, but it's a bitch to read.  In this book Wallace uses his vast vocabulary in such a way that you'd think it would disappear if not exercised constantly.  He even goes so far as to make up new words to try out.  In one piece here he twice uses the word 'weeest', not because it is a more precise adjective than 'wee' (as in &quot;...hours of the morning&quot;) but because its three-consecutive E's make it look exotic.  It's style winning out over substance.  And those paragraphs!  They're endless.  Try holding your breath for five minutes, and you'll know what it's like wading through a DFW paragraph.  I asphyxiated on more than one occasion.  Especially when those marathon paragraphs were made up of but a single sentence.  As for the footnotes, sometimes they added substance to the piece, but more often than not they were merely distracting.  One piece in particular actually had more text in the footnotes than in the main body.  I was flipping back and forth like a madman trying to figure out what I was supposed to read next.<br />But the biggest peeve I had was his insistence on leaving the reader hanging.  There are no payoffs here.  The pieces don't end; they just stop.  Sometimes I thought they could have gone on interminably, but instead Wallace decided to quit at some random point.  After wading through twenty or so pages of philosophical ramblings and long-winded discussions, a punchline would have helped make me look forward to the next piece.  As it is, I didn't. <br />I must say, though, that I wish I had Wallace's talent.  That's not to say that I would use it the same way he does but it would be nice to have it there when I needed it.  He seems to be constantly involved in a game of showing it off.  His style is self indulgent to the nth degree.  &quot;Let's see how cool I can be,&quot; he seems to be saying.  &quot;Let's see how far post-modernism can stretch.&quot;  The odd thing is that Wallace is willing to admit to this fault in an interesting way.  Witness the first line in the last sub-chapter of the piece titled 'Octet': &quot;You are, unfortunately, a fiction writer.&quot;  He puts this (ironic) hindrance on the reader's shoulder.  But as the piece moves along, it becomes apparent that he's constructing a meta-fictional rebuke of the sub-chapters that appeared before this one.  He rips their intentions and their techniques to shreds.  Ad infinitum.  It's a great bit of self-referential (dare I say) theatre; the post-modern writer attacking his own post-modernism, in a hyper-post-modern way.  It's enough to make the reader's head spin.  Mine did.<br />There are a couple of other pieces here that really hooked me.  &quot;Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko&quot; is Wallace at his most fun.  Using contemporary cultural objects as a new language, punning mercilessly (e.g. a line describing University of Southern California cheerleaders as &quot;attendants at the Saturday temple of the padded gods Ra &amp; Sisboomba&quot; had me chuckling but good), and coining modern day epigrams such as &quot;The Medium would handle the Message's PR&quot;, he tells a convoluted tale about modern narcissism.  Although the joke runs out of steam halfway through, it's still quite a strong piece.  The opening piece, &quot;A Radically Condensed History of Post-Industrial Life&quot; clearly shows Wallace can be a genius when he focuses his gifts.  And the title pieces, a quartet interspersed throughout the book, embodies all the problems I've detailed above.  But they are still quite powerful in their depiction of modern man's ugliness (or rather 'hideousness').<br />I admit that there were some pieces here that I couldn't finish, either out of frustration or ignorance.  That's probably more my fault than Dave's.  Still, he could have helped me out a bit.  But he never did.  So even though I admired his talents, I didn't like his book.	2001-07-11
US	49333751	R3E3NWZ2WLE7ZB	0552134643	690753180	Reaper Man, A Discworld Novel	Books	4	8	10	N	N	A cohesive ending would have made this perfect	&quot;Reaper Man&quot; has all the elements of a good Discworld book.  Old friends -- Death, The Librarian -- show up and reap (pun intended) havoc.  A gaggle of befuddled wizards leave the sanctuary of Unseen University to try and solve a mystical dilemma.  And a sheltered innocent, an old wizard named Windle Poons, learns a little something about himself.  All fine and good.  The problem, and thankfully it is a rare occurrence in Pratchett's world, is that these elements don't interact enough to create a cohesive whole.  Pity.<br />Death gets top billing here, and he is fleshed-out wonderfully (a tough task considering he had no flesh to begin with).  A supernatural career crisis leads him to a job harvesting crops, where his skill with a scythe is put to good use.  A budding relationship with his new employer, Miss Flitworth, teaches him to actually live.<br />Windle Poons undergoes a crisis of his own.  He's died.  Well, almost.  See, Death is not around to collect him.  So what happens?  Well, Terry heaps confusing circumstances on poor Mr. Poons.  Poons reacts in much of the same way that Death did.  He learns to live, too.  After 130-years of sheltered existence, not to mention the last 50 years living with a decrepit body, he is liberated by Death.  Only Terry could come up with such a wacky but logically sound notion.<br />The rest of the cast of characters, including the Wizards and a rag-tag group of misfits called the Fresh Start Club, lively wander around the plot, narrowly bumping into each other while providing fine comic moments.  The Wizards get a little too caught up in their quest, eventually donning cloth headbands and yelling &quot;Yo!&quot; as if going into Rambo-style warfare.  Couple this with their sheltered pomposity, and we get truly funny moments.  The Fresh Start Club is quite the inspired creation on Terry's part.  Their group is made up of the failed undead, including a bogeyman who's scared of people, a wolf who turns into a man during a full moon, and a shy banshee who, instead of wailing, slips a card under your door that reads: &quot;OOoooEeeeOooEeeeOOOeee&quot;.  I would have liked to spend more time with this motley crew.<br />And Terry's concept of what happens when Death is not around (to collect humanity's deceased life force) is a true revelation.  It confused me at first, but upon further reflection, I realized that not only has he conjured up a truly poetic invention, but has made a sly comment on the reign of terror consumerism has inflicted on our culture.  I'll say no more; just be prepared to sing for your supper because Terry's not about to hold your hand (with explicit explanation) through these sections.<br />So the elements are all there.  But they never interact in any meaningful way.  Terry usually manages to tie the varying narrative threads together by the end.  The end here is satisfying in its own way (Death's final scenes are poetic and beautiful), but doesn't carry its weight in terms of helping unify the book's structure.  It made me think that there were really two or three distinct stories here, slapped together without much afterthought, to create one full-sized book.  That was really my only problem.  The rest of the book is enchanting and wonderful; a lesser entry in the Discworld series, but fine reading nonetheless.	2001-06-28
US	49333751	R2EF1QZ6A9SAAF	038549744X	710198060	English Passengers: A Novel	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Too many captains throw this ship of course	Matthew Kneale has certainly written an impressive book here.  He says much, in many different ways, and he obviously worked hard at it.  The issues he tackles are certainly important, if somewhat underdeveloped.  And the stylistic choices he employs are technically proficient, if a little cold.  But the act of reading was tiresome, only briefly lightened by moments of levity.<br />The narrative had a kind of hyper-&quot;Rashomon&quot; quality to it.  The raping and pillaging of Tasmanian aborigines by English colonists is told from the point of view of no less than 21 different narrators.  Twenty-one!  Are you kidding me, Mr. Kneale?  Some are given but one chapter to stake their claim on the narrative, which is not nearly enough time to establish a distinctive voice.  Others appear repeatedly throughout, and most certainly do have a distinctive voice.  I'll say that I admire Kneale's ambition in trying to tell a story from such a convoluted perspective.  I'm just not sure he pulled it off.<br />Of the multiple narrators, there are four given the bulk of the storytelling duties, to varying degrees of success.<br />Peevay is our &quot;half-caste&quot; (his mother was raped by a white man) guide through his native Tasmania.  His sections reminded of &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, wherein the narrator becomes increasingly more intelligent, literate and erudite as his education increases.  Peevay is brought up in the white man's schools, and takes on his language with ease.  He slips in bits of posh English speech and bible references to his narrative.  He also becomes increasingly pained as he's isolated from his people and, most importantly, from his domineering mother.  Peevay is a tragic voice that Kneale handles well, almost perfectly.<br />Illium Quillian Kewley is the Captain of the ship 'Sincerity', charged with taking the title characters to Tasmania.  He is a devious little fellow, constantly trying to sneak prohibited cargo past English custom in his ship's secret hold, and is hampered by his fair share of bad luck.  Kewley provides much of the comedy in the novel, as he and his motley crew do their best to keep their treasured vessel (not to mention their finances) afloat.  He's an appealing creation; the problem is that sometimes his farcical adventures break up the somber tone that Kneale has worked so hard to create.  I'm all for comic relief in my tragedies, but these sections so dominate the book that a pervading sense of unevenness is created.<br />Reverend Geoffrey Wilson, amateur geologist and pompous theologian, is on his way to Tasmania to discover the &quot;real&quot; Garden of Eden.  He concocts a theory called &quot;Divine Refrigeration&quot; to explain how the earth's crust cooled in only 6,000-years rather than the science-backed figure of billions and billions.  It is a fine example of his muddled thinking.  Wilson is a character much in the same vein as Kewley, in that he provides much for the reader to find ridiculous.  Only Wilson's scenes are far more integral to the plot than Kewley's, and thus works better within the narrative.<br />Dr. Thomas Potter is the most problematic narrator of the bunch.  His intentions are clouded in mystery through the first half of the book (I'm loathe to give away his purpose for the journey), making them all the more sinister.  The problem is that his voice is only heard through the shorthand/jargon-filled ramblings of his notebook.  These sections definitely brought the book to a grinding halt, as most of the reader's effort is spent trying to decipher this quirky language.

He says much, in many different ways, and he obviously worked hard at it.  The issues he tackles are certainly important, if somewhat underdeveloped.  And the stylistic choices he employs are technically proficient, if a little cold.  But the act of reading was tiresome, only briefly lightened by moments of levity.<br />The narrative had a kind of hyper-&quot;Rashomon&quot; quality to it.  The raping and pillaging of Tasmanian aborigines by English colonists is told from the point of view of no less than 21 different narrators.  Twenty-one!  Are you kidding me, Mr. Kneale?  Some are given but one chapter to stake their claim on the narrative, which is not nearly enough time to establish a distinctive voice.  Others appear repeatedly throughout, and most certainly do have a distinctive voice.  I'll say that I admire Kneale's ambition in trying to tell a story from such a convoluted perspective.  I'm just not sure he pulled it off.<br />Of the multiple narrators, there are four given the bulk of the storytelling duties, to varying degrees of success.<br />Peevay is our &quot;half-caste&quot; (his mother was raped by a white man) guide through his native Tasmania.  His sections reminded me of &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, wherein the narrator becomes increasingly more intelligent, literate and erudite as his education increases.  Peevay is brought up in the white man's schools, and takes on his language with ease.  He slips in bits of posh English speech and bible references to his narrative.  He also becomes increasingly pained as he's isolated from his people and, most importantly, from his domineering mother.  Peevay is a tragic voice that Kneale handles well, almost perfectly.<br />Illium Quillian Kewley is the Captain of the ship 'Sincerity', charged with taking the title characters to Tasmania.  He is a devious little fellow, constantly trying to sneak prohibited cargo past English customs in hisship's secret hold, and is hampered by his fair share of bad luck.  Kewley provides much of the comedy in the novel, as he and his motley crew do their best to keep their treasured vessel (not to mention their finances) afloat.  He's an appealing creation; the problem is that sometimes his farcical adventures break up the somber tone that Kneale has worked so hard to create.  I'm all for comic relief in my tragedies, but these sections so dominate the book that a pervading sense of unevenness is created.<br />Reverend Geoffrey Wilson, amateur geologist and pompous theologian, is on his way to Tasmania to discover the &quot;real&quot; Garden of Eden.  He concocts a theory called &quot;Divine Refrigeration&quot; to explain how the earth's crust cooled in only 6,000-years rather than the science-backed figure of billions and billions.  It is a fine example of his muddled thinking.  Wilson is a character much in the same vein as Kewley, in that he provides much for the reader to find ridiculous.  Only Wilson's scenes are far more integral to the plot than Kewley's, and thus work better within the narrative.<br />Dr. Thomas Potter is the most problematic narrator of the bunch.  His intentions are clouded in mystery through the first half of the book (I'm loathe to give away his purpose for the journey), making them all the more sinister.  The problem is that his voice is only heard through the shorthand/jargon-filled ramblings of his notebook.  These sections definitely brought the book to a grinding halt, as most of the reader's effort is spent trying to decipher this quirky language.  I understand the reasons Kneale had for doing this; I just didn't enjoy them.<br />These four men and their fascinating stories careen awkwardly towards each other.  After awhile, you see where Kneale is going with all this.  The ending, however, was haphazardly thrown together, incorporating too many of the adventure elements.

US	49333751	R7L0T0NV1J9HD	0552134635	51458965	Moving Pictures (Discworld Novel S.)	Books	4	10	14	N	N	A lesser Discworld book, but still entertaining	&quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, while not in and of itself and weak book, is one of the lesser entries in the Discworld series.  It's first half is anchored more by parody -- which Pratchett uses sparsely and to great effect in the other books -- than by satire -- which is Pratchett's real strength, and the thing that gives the other books their weight.  The parody manifests itself in Pratchett's doppelganger depiction of the American movie industry.  He gets the characters just right (e.g., an egomaniacal film producer, a talking dog who fancies himself an agent, and leading actors who are vacuous and mundane once the camera stops rolling), but the cheekiness of the situations he presents come off as rather cheesy.<br />There are too many mangled quotations from famous movies, such as a dog inquiring &quot;What's up, duck?&quot;, or a lady troll remarking, on an old-fashioned mating ritual, that &quot;a brick on the head could be quite complimentary, but diamonds are a girl's best friend.&quot;  And the epic being made in the book's middle-third section is about a civil war, a city burning in flames, and the love between a stuck-up Southern Belle and an older distinguished gentleman.  When pressed for a title, the film's producer thinks it should having to do with wind, and finally comes up with... 'Blown Away'.  The setup to that inconsequential joke was too long to be funny.<br />Although I should note that not all of the film parodies are hokey.  At one point a giant woman carries an ape in her hand as she climbs a tall building, and all regret that they don't have a camera rolling to catch the scene.  And a golden statue of a bald man holding a sword &quot;looks just like my Uncle Oswald!&quot;  Pratchett has some fun with his jokes, but I just found there to be too many of them.  They were distracting.<br />Another problem is that the ending just takes too long to unravel.  There are myriads of subplots that need to be resolved, some introduced during the final encounter itself and further complicating things.  Keeping this story simple would have been a good idea.  Terry tended to let it get away from him.<br />The final problem I noticed was that the romantic leads, Victor and Ginger, lacked any heat.  Terry seemed to rely on the reader's assumption that since they were the main male and female characters, then love would naturally bloom.  He did little to develop this idea, but consistently allowed its possibility to seep into the narrative.<br />All that being said, there were some interesting aspects to the book.  A strong point is made about the strength of movie magic (especially in comparison with the Discworld's &quot;real&quot; magic).  Although a tad underdeveloped, the idea that people are unconsciously drawn to &quot;Holy Wood&quot; was a thoughtful take on the power of the imagination.  And the continuing growth of the character of the Librarian (for the uninitiated, he is a former wizard magically transformed into an orangutan... and perfectly happy to stay that way!) is a joy to watch.  Even though he can say nothing more than &quot;Ook&quot;, he is consistently the most sensible and conscientious character in any Discworld book, using his logic and reason to save the day.	2001-05-22

Jon Stewart is one of my favourite comedians, and one of the few show business people who I consider inherently funny.  Even without good material, the man still makes me laugh.  Thankfully this collection of short humour pieces, which cannot rely on Stewart's dry stage presence, is full of good material.<br />The collection does suffer from the transient nature of pop culture, as some of the sacred cows he slays are no longer sacred.  Upon publication in 1998, the inexplicable popularity of Hanson and the death of Princess Diana were hot news; now, they're just faded memories.  Still, chronicling Mother Hanson's yearly family newsletter from pre-stardom happy innocence to after the icon's fall is a brilliant concept.  And Di's schoolgirl fan letters to Mother Theresa show Stewart's strength in handling tone.  This is also apparent in another strong piece, \\"Adolph Hitler: The Larry King Interview\\", in which der Fuehrer comes off as a `90's sensitive man who \\"hates crowds.\\"  Stewart even manages a few potshots at King's propensity for rapid marriages.<br />Other strong pieces include: \\"Breakfast at Kennedy's\\", in which Stewart imagines himself as a playmate of the young JFK, and is dubbed \\"The Zippy Zionist\\" by a carefree and very Catholic Camelot clan; \\"The Last Supper, or The Dead Waiter\\", in which Jesus and his party dine at a trendy restaurant, served by a very bitchy waiter; and \\"Da Vinci: The Lost Notebook\\", in which Leonardo is given credit for inventing, among other items, the beer helmet (neat drawings, here).<br />The smartest piece, and the one that most distinctly bites the hand that feeds, is entitled \\"The Recipe\\".  Stewart details the recipe for a standard Hollywood awards show.  It's very deadpan, very silly, and very accurate.  It also shows the man's well-hidden disdain towards familiarity in comedy, and how pure a science he thinks it is.  That passion for his craft is evident throughout this collection. <br />Where Stewart suffers, at least in comparison to Woody Allen's humour pieces, is his reliance on pop culture.  Sure, he tries to mix high and low culture by imagining Vincent Van Gogh in an AOL chat room, or Lenny Bruce working on a sitcom pilot, but these ideas never really leave the conception stage.  And retelling Daniel Webster's story, replacing him with Bill Gates, is just too easy a target.  However, Stewart doesn't rely on the surreal non-sequiturs that Woody peppered his pieces with.  His comedic arrow is always aimed directly at the target, and the pieces work better because of it.<br />There is enough quality comedy here to make this a worthwhile read (it's slight enough to digest in an afternoon, if you are so inclined).  And it shows enough promise that I'd hope Stewart takes another kick at the can, if only in an attempt to get everything just right.	2001-05-19
US	49333751	RZUMPMGXF0OHZ	0679753834	420678567	The Risk Pool	Books	4	8	11	N	N	If you can get by the first half, you're in for a treat	Essentially a fictional autobiography told in two halves, \\"The Risk Pool\\" also serves as a neat summary of the development of Richard Russo's personal voice and writing style.<br />The book's first half focuses on the formative years of Ned Hall, our trusty narrator.  He is sharp and self-aware, periodically making pointed references to the circumstances of his life and how they influence the events to come.  His parents are divorced, and he is shuffled back and forth between his mentally unstable mother and his egocentric father.  The story in this section treads much of the same territory as Russo's first book, \\"Mohawk\\".  In fact, all of the action here takes place in that dying small town.  Even some of \\"Mohawk\\"s secondary characters make return appearances here (e.g., Untemeyer the bookie).  It would have been a welcome return to a familiar setting, if I hadn't been so disappointed by \\"Mohawk\\".  \\"The Risk Pool\\" falls easily into that book's traps.  Russo populates his burg with a menagerie of sad characters, but does too much work in his prose explaining their psychology and motivations.  It becomes bland and stilted after awhile.  And even though there are some moments that predict Russo's later brilliance (e.g., Ned, his father, and his father's friend Wussy go on a fishing trip that is typical of the quality found in Russo's later oeuvre) they are not enough to save the plodding first half.<br />However, if you can make it to page 268, you'll be rewarded with the book's poignant second half.<br />I read \\"Mohawk\\" immediately after finishing \\"Nobody's Fool\\", and was startled by the difference in quality between those two works.  It baffled me that one man could have written both works.  Now I know how it happened.  The second half of \\"The Risk Pool\\" is leaps and bounds ahead of its first.  Russo accomplishes this by finding his eventual strength: razor sharp dialogue.  The first half focused on explaining predicaments rather than showing their impact through conversation, and the story suffered because of it.  Granted, our narrator is in his early teens as the half ends, and shy to boot, so he doesn't have many opportunities for talk.  In the second half, Ned is ten years older, cynical about his academic career, and moving back to Mohawk for a second time.  His father (and his father's friends) treats him as an adult, and the conversations these small town men have are interesting, descriptive, humourous, biting, and highly relevant.  They spend much time in bars, drinking and betting, ignoring the women that may love them, but completely engrossed in their destructive lives.  It may be the same subject matter for Russo, but he does it so well that I have no quibble with his one-track mind.<br />I don't want to give too much away, but I would like to mention that Russo does a fine job moving the book towards a series of touching endings.  They made me realize the one thing that served as a saving grace for the book's first half.  The scope of the story developed in the narrative's lengthy beginning, detailing a life from childhood to manhood, allows the reader to get to know Ned Hall, [and] his father Sam, ...more intimately.  So when these people have relationship difficulties, or experience personal tragedy, the reader can't help but feel involved.  I did.  Russo handles his ending with grace and a delicate touch, when he could easily have let it become maudlin and sappy.  I commend him for that.	2001-05-14
US	49333751	R3C5EJR70FFL3J	1857989546	372532263	Eric (Discworld, Book 9)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Thin Discworld book, thick with hilarity	I don't think &quot;Faust&quot; (or, rather, &quot;Eric&quot;) deserves the scorn it has received.  It is only a lesser Discworld novel because it is so short.  Call it a novella, get over your preconceptions, and dive in for the fun.<br />The chief element of fun here is the welcome return of the (ineffectual) wizard Rincewind.  He is my favourite Disc-denizen.  When last we left him in &quot;Sourcery&quot;, he was in a curious predicament, trapped in a dimension he couldn't run away from.  Summoned to our world by a 13-year old demonologist (the title character), Rincewind must figure out how to grant wishes.  This is all a very curious set up, kind of flimsy and flaky.  Fortunately, Pratchett uses it as a diving board into a grand pool of hilarious satire.<br />Pratchett touches on some large issues in this slender volume.  We get a sarcastic retelling of the Trojan War, and then a dip into the Odyssey.  There's a section that concurrently examines both the beginning *and* the end of the universe (this is Douglas Adams territory Pratchett is treading in, and he more than holds his own).  And we get a neat trip to Hell, that satirizes both eternal damnation and corporate culture (not a groundbreaking comparison, I know, but still a funny bit in Terry's hands).  Eric (the character) is nothing more than Twoflower-lite.  But that's okay, because the relationship between Twoflower and Rincewind in the first two Discworld books (&quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;) was golden.  Eric continues in this tradition, his youthful ignorance and passion meshing perfectly with Rincewind's cynicism and cowardice.<br />My one complaint is that I wanted to spend more time in each location with these characters, and for the life of me I can't figure out why Pratchett didn't stretch this book out to usual length.  I guess he wanted to leave us wanting more.  I did.	2001-05-01
US	49333751	R24XQ4TJPK4EWK	0679736646	201087508	Ubik	Books	3	2	9	N	N	A mesh of fine speculation and wasted opportunities	I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out my take on &quot;Ubik&quot;.  I enjoyed the speculation it offers, where the futures of the afterlife, corporate culture, and advertising are imagined in a very believable (and simply explained) way.  I also enjoyed the suspense and mystery elements it offers.  Someone has sabotaged Runciter Associates, the world's leading &quot;prudence organization&quot; (telepathic defenders against precognitive corporate raiders; don't trust my explanation, just know that Dick's is much more clear), and now they're slowly dying off.  But how, and why?  It is an interesting setup and the answer comes slowly and assuredly (except for the ending, which felt like an unnecessary tweaking of the tension, and logically made little sense).  These disparate elements were handled well.<br />The problem is that the elements don't add up to a cohesive whole.  Or rather, a cohesive whole that transcends the genre.  Science fiction, to me, should speak about grand issues on a grand scale.  The issues here were focussed on a very small group of people, and did not really speak to a larger community.  I don't feel threatened by a half-life menace, such as the one that stalks Joe Chip and his crew.  Although the idea of inertials, precogs, telepaths, etc. does hit close to home, the dystopian future Dick creates just didn't scare me enough.  And besides, the characters he creates are quite slight, nothing more than two-dimensional devices around which paranoia swirls.<br />Another problem is more a result of wasted opportunity, based on personal biases.  I truly enjoy works that explore the possibilities and perils of time travel (the second &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movie is my favourite of that series, and a fine example of the fun a warped space-time continuum can provide in a narrative context).  When the Runciter gang goes back in time (in a way), Dick only tangentially explores this phenomenon (e.g. Joe Chip discussing the outcome of WWII witha xenophobic pilot), and to me that's not enough.  Like I said, it's an opportunity wasted.<br />Dick does his best work here within the epigraphs that begin each chapter.  Set up as advertisements for the mysterious title-product, each is a parody of omnipotent cure-all consumer products.  But Dick also throws in a menacing warning line that the unfocused consumer wouldn't pick up on.  They provided the lion's share of laughs in the novel.	2001-05-01

Unfortunately, for its first half, &quot;The Collector Collector&quot; did not live up to that book's standards.  It lacked its narrative thrust and rollicking sense of humour.  Hindsight tells me that I just wasn't getting Fischer's intent.  I now see that he wrote a demented, perverted, and hyper-articulate version of &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;, where the female protagonists are as likely to maim and murder their sexual conquests, as fall in love with them.  Also, there's a professional matchmaker trapped down a well by a dissatisfied customer, and many frozen iguanas.  This is all filtered through the magic-realist perspective of the main character, a 5,000-year-old bowl.  Who can read minds.  And change shapes.  If none of this makes sense to you, I take full blame, for Fischer manages to hold it all together perfectly.<br />On the surface, there's much here to giggle at, and think about.  But underneath all that, there's also a lot of loneliness in the book.  People are constantly running from or pushing away romantic partners, for inexplicable reasons.  Rosa, in whose London flat much of the action takes place, is desperate for every man she meets to fall in love with her.  Contrast this with Nikki, a kleptomaniac/prostitute/houseguest, who doesn't even know what kind of happiness she wants.  And then we have our narrator, the bowl, who appears to have witnessed the entirety of human history, and has an endless catalogue of human characteristics stored away, but can't speak with those around him (her?).    <br />There's really not much story here to hang your hat on.  The book is a series of quick scenes, tableaus, culled from Rosa and Nikki's everyday life interspersed with stories from the bowl's memory.  I found that hard to handle at first, but got used to the style after a while.  And in the end, even though I didn't enjoy it as much as &quot;The Thought Gang&quot;, I still got a kick out of &quot;The Collector Collector&quot;.	2001-04-25

On the one hand, it fancies itself a complex character study.  What happens to the idealist, after years in a job he's too good for and a family he may not love, when he spends two months in a cabin in the woods?  What happens to his family and the long-suffering wife?  On the other hand, there are some decent mystery-thriller elements in the book's second half, that push it into the realm of the page-turner.  The amazing thing is that it functions equally well in both respects.<br />The story is essentially told in two halves.  The first is told from Willis' point of view.  He is a cynical curmudgeon (regular readers of this space will know of the soft spot in my heart for that character type), smarter and more literate than he needs to be, and condescending to those that surround him.  And oh yeah, he loves his guitars (being an amateur guitar nerd myself, I related quite strongly to Willis' need to \\"rock out\\" on a daily basis).  The second half is told from the perspective of Willis' wife, Jean.  Jean, in the first half of the book, does not do much but nag and sulk.  She was not truly defined, except in relation to Willis.  She was \\"Willis' Wife\\", and not much more.  Thus, I was not looking forward to getting inside her head.  Thankfully, Gates does a fine job of fleshing out her character, and letting the reader in on her secret desires.  He does this (both with Jean and with Willis) chiefly by amplifying their self-awareness.  Jean knows that when she lies to her kids they probably see through it, and wonders how much damage she is doing.  Yet she does it repeatedly.  Willis at one point, in a typical moment of clarity, asks himself: \\"How can this happen to someone so well read?\\"  They are both self-conscious to the bitter end, and it is all handled so well, that the reader is hard-pressed to believe that these are merely fictional characters.<br />Gates has a fine flair for dialogue.  He is able to produce some flashy and witty turns of phrase (usually spouting from the mouth of Willis' brother Champ), but thankfully lets loose only sporadically.  The other times, the dialogue is very smart, but also very real.  He is not afraid to give 12-year old daughter Mel(anie) a line such as \\"I've already had like how many first days of school in my life\\" because that is how a 12-year old girl would talk.<br />Some have criticized the book for getting bogged down in details.  Sure, there are several instances where a laundry list of items found in the Willis' kitchen tries to pass itself off as a paragraph of prose.  It didn't annoy me.  Rather, I found it quite necessary.  Gates gets a lot of mileage out of showing the characters in their surroundings with their material possessions (e.g. Books they were reading, albums they'd listen to, TV shows they would watch, etc.).  It worked well to me.  What didn't work well was Gates' overindulgence in the use of italics.  Most pages had not one, but three or four sentences of dialogue where italics were used, as if Gates was uncomfortable letting the reader decide where emphasis should fall.  That's just a minor critique, but one I thought worth mentioning.<br />Overall, the book reminded me of similar terrain trotted on by Don DeLillo (the suburban angst of \\"White Noise\\") and Richard Russo (mostly \\"Straight Man\\", but also \\"Nobody's Fool\\").  Although Gates doesn't approach the greatness of those authors -- a difficult feat if you ask me -- he does hold his own.	2001-04-21

Thus it doesn't surprise me that it's taken this long for my first trip through the tulips with Jeeves and Wooster.  It saddens me, but it doesn't surprise me.  \\"Saddens\\" for this confection is the perfect mix of all of the elements of comedy.<br />On one level, the story is classic bedroom farce.  The action takes place in a country house, where people are constantly running from one room to another.  Everytime one door opens, a new misunderstanding occurs and the plot is violently thrown in another direction.  It makes one realize how effective a well-constructed bedroom farce can be in delivering sparkling comedy.<br />On top of the farcical elements, Wodehouse also manages to throw in some biting satire.  There are well placed but subtle jabs at fascism, fashionable psychology, and upper class morality.  They never trip up the story, only serving as wonderful little digressions that do much to add weight to the lighter elements.<br />The book is populated by a wonderfully motley crew of snooty misfits, each doing their bit to stoke the fires of the story.  But the cake is taken by Jeeves and Wooster themselves.  Neither could exist without the other (at least in a literary sense).  The first fifty or so pages prove this, as Wooster heads up to the country house ahead of his manservant.  The character flounders during these sections.  Only when Jeeves arrives (to save the day, natch) does the narrative gain an even greater head of steam.  I can't imagine how tedious it would be to listen to Bertie Wooster's mindless meanderings for a whole book, without the simple and economic replies of his man Jeeves.  They are the pins in the balloons that release Bertie's hot air.  As I said before, this is my first foray into Jeeves and Wooster country, so I can't say if the other tales in the series live up to the standard set here.  It would seem like an impossible task.<br />The brilliance of the Jeeves/Wooster dichotomy is that Wodehouse doesn't take the easy route; that is, telling the story through Jeeves narration.  It would be too easy to allow us into Jeeves brain, where we would either be confronted by his undying loyalty (which the reader could never understand, given the ignorance of his charge) or his hatred for Bertie (which would undermine the whole tale).  Rather, we get Bertie's side of things, and his ambiguous depiction of his man makes Jeeves that much more intriguing a character.  And furthermore, it allows Bertie to be a very interesting \\"unreliable narrator\\".  We cannot trust -- but can laugh at -- his recollections of past events (the book is told entirely through recollections), or his characterization of hisself (in which he tries to pass himself off as an intellectual, rather than a pompous boob).  The \\"unreliable narrator\\" is my favourite of the current post-modern literary fads, one which Wodehouse gleefully saunters through a half century before its time (side note: for a fine example of a case where the modest butler also serves as the \\"unreliable narrator\\", see Kazuo Ishiguro's book \\"The Remains of the Day\\", a personal favourite of mine).<br />One cautionary note, though: in this edition, don't read the introduction first.  Alexander Cockburn can't help but give away some key plot points in the examples he provides of Wodehouse's comedic prose.  It is a finely written essay, but it belongs at the end rather than the beginning, so to not spoil the reader's fun of discovery.

The enjoyment comes from the questions I ask myself after I've put the book down.  It is not an enjoyable reading experience, but rather a contemplative one.  In that regard, it is a highly successful piece of art.<br />The story appears to be relatively simple.  One man goes driving.  He meets another man on the road.  The two of them meet some eccentric millionaires.  The four men play poker.  Then two men build a wall.  It is almost nonsensical now that I look back on it.  But the story's not really the thing (it never is in an Auster book).  So don't go looking for closure, and don't expect easy answers.  It's all just an excuse for some finely written meditations on the nature of fate and the restrictions of freedom.<br />Auster's writing style is enigmatic.  There is a faux-coldness to it, appearing at first glance distant and reserved.  Closer inspection, however, reveals much humanity and passion in his prose.  I've always had suspicions that his surname is really an ingeniously calculated pseudonym, for any austerity in the writing is both sincere and ironic.  That's a neat trick to pull off, and, to my mind, his greatest strength as a writer.  In this example from his oeuvre, he gets the balance just right.	2001-04-08
US	49333751	R1IDFY8PEPQT83	0679753826	601428370	Mohawk	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Before Russo found his voice	I have been reading through Russo's oeuvre in reverse chronological order.  &quot;Straight Man&quot; lit a fire under me.  &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; left me in tears (of both joy and sadness).  &quot;Mohawk&quot;, his first book, fails to live up to the standard left by those two Goliaths.  Is it fair to judge a writer's first book, where he's still working on and developing his style, against the works he wrote as an assured and confident author?  Probably not, but that's what I have to do.<br />&quot;Mohawk&quot; has a lot in common with &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;.  Both focus on life in a rundown small town in upstate New York, struggling under economic pressures.  Both feature diners, OTBs (Off Track Betting), and late night poker games as prominent locations.  Both feature a character who is selfish, forgetful, and burnt-out by life, has an ex-wife and son that he never sees, but is universally loved against everybody's better judgement.  So if I were Russo's editor, what could I suggest to turn a substandard &quot;Mohawk&quot; into something akin to the brilliant &quot;Fool&quot;?<br />First, exorcise the acres of descriptive prose (one of Russo's few weaknesses), and amplify the sparkling dialogue (which is Russo's greatest strength, and is terribly underused here).  Then, concentrate the narrative's attention on one character.  The problem that he encounters here is that there are no fully defined people.  He is trying to create a tapestry, to show how everyone in town is affected by the peculiarities of small-town life.  On that count, he succeeds.  But the story has no focus, and suffers from it.  Although not as strong a character as Donald Sullivan from &quot;Fool&quot;, Dallas Younger (the aforementioned 'man you can't help loving') could have been.  Within the first fifty pages he forgets about a drunken bender in which he dropped in on his dead brother's wife in the middle of the night, playfully teases his young niece, and, most tellingly, loses his false teeth (not to worry, for since this has happened before, he always carries a spare set).  I was looking forward to following the adventures of this peculiar man.  Alas, there are long stretches in the middle of the book where he is nowhere to be found.<br />My last suggestion would be to junk the book's second half.  It features a theft, a murder, and a tabloid trial.  And it drags the book down.  I can see what Russo was trying to do.  I just don't think it worked.<br />There are some good points here.  There's a flexibility with time structure that was, although confusing at first, quite effective.  Many of the characters and their relationships are quite interesting, if a little underdeveloped (I'm thinking of a pair of mother-daughter relationships that are poignant in their simplicity).  And the story manages to move along at a quick pace, but never rushes the issue when exposing important details.  So I did like a lot of the book.  Unfortunately it pales in comparison with Russo's later works.	2001-04-04

A depiction of Mingus the man, including a psychological and/or anecdotal interpretation of his character?<br />There's not a lot of that here.  Although I will say that this falls into the category of what I call \\"John Bonham Biographies\\", named for the Led Zeppelin drummer who came off as a manic-depressive Jekyl and Hyde in the book \\"Hammer of the Gods\\".  Another good example of this is humourist Michael O'Donoghue in Dennis Perrin's bio \\"Mr. Mike\\".  Mingus, in Priestley's hands, is an extreme man.  He is either a soulful genius, or a tyrannical, violent, out-of-control maniac.  It always strikes me as a road too easily traveled by the biographer, and is thus distracting.<br />2.  A theoretical explanation of Mingus' music, with the intent of illustrating why he casts such a powerful shadow over the jazz world (as unparalleled bassist *and* composer)?<br />There's oodles of that here.  Unfortunately, it leaves very little room for the layman to join the party.  At times the book reads like an advanced textbook on modern jazz theory.  I guess I should have taken the title of the book -- \\"A Critical Biography\\" -- a little more seriously.  Also, there are references made to Mingus quoting other songs within his own, which further baffled me, as it would anyone but the most knowledgeable jazz historian.  And when he tries to determine Mingus' place in music history, Priestley isn't afraid to let the hyperbole fly.  Like when he implies that rock `n' roll is an indirect descendant from a relationship between Alexis Korner and Mingus in London.  Or an attempt to elevate Mingus' jazz as an artform, when compared to the vacuous pop of the mid-1960s, which lacks credibility because the vacuous being compared to is the (relatively) sophisticated music of the Beatles!  Or an absurd claim that a disastrous concert Mingus put on at the Town Hall in New York \\"caused more fallout than the almost simultaneous Cuban Missile Crisis\\"!  These and other arguments are handled sloppily at best, and do a disservice to Mingus himself.<br />3.  An explanation/refutation of Mingus' fantastic semi-autobiography \\"Beneath the Underdog\\"?<br />You're in luck, because at times it feels like Priestley has a copy of Mingus' book beside him as he writes, ticking off fact after fact as it is corrected or explained here.  Which might have been helpful had I read \\"Beneath the Underdog\\", but I haven't.  And now don't need to.  He should have just published a version of \\"The Annotated Beneath the Underdog\\", and left the biography writing to someone else with an original sense of narrative.<br />So just be sure you know what your goals are when confronting this work.  Jazzheads and Mingus-freaks, you're welcome to join the party.  Casual jazz fans and Mingus admirers (of which I am one), step lightly.  Fans of biography, do yourself a favour and pass on by.  Oh, and I almost forgot.  This book has the tackiest, creepiest, and most irresponsible closing line of any book I have ever read.  I just hope that Dannie Richmond (drummer and frequent Mingus band member) hasn't seen it.ssile Crisis\\"!

Books	5	4	5	N	N	When the Whittle* becomes the Winners	(*definition contained herein)<br />Like &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; before it, &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; takes a well-known tale, and changes its focus.  While &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; looked at MacBeth through the eyes of the three witches, &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; looks at the genre of heroic fantasy, only the hero is not who you'd expect it to be.  Terry is now two-for-two when trodding down this particular deconstructionist path.<br />The guards of the Watch are the henchman you've seen in a Bruce Lee movie, who each take their turn trying to stop Bruce, all to similar degrees of failure.  They're the stormtroopers in the Star Wars series.  They're the no-name actor who accompanies Kirk, Spock, and Bones down to the alien planet in Star Trek.  They are anonymous and ineffectual, chameleonlike in their ability to fade into the scenery.  Or at least that's how the conventions of the genre treat them.  In Pratchett's hands they transcend their fate, move to the lip of the stage, and save the day.<br />It is such a pleasure to follow the character development of Captain Vimes and his men, Nobby, Colon, and their new protégé Carrot.  There are some sublime moments where they learn to understand the conventions of the genre, and use it to their own benefit.  My favourite occurs when they have to hit the &quot;voonerable&quot; spot of a dragon with an arrow, and deduce that a million-to-one shot is always successful in times like these.  So what do they do?  They conspire to make the shot more difficult (standing on one leg, wearing a blindfold, etc.) to make the odds worse, therefore being more in their favour!  It is such a joy to try and traverse through such a minefield of ridiculous logic.<br />The story, now that I look back on it, is told in two parts.  The first is pretty standard fare: a disenchanted &quot;citizen&quot; wants to install a puppet monarch.  They unleash a dragon on the city, for if the dragon is slayed by a hero that hero will be crowned asking by public demand.  Only of course things go wrong.  The second half of the book shows how wrong.  I'm not going to ruin it, but needless to say that things take a very surprising turn through a chain of events that to my mind is unprecedented in fantasy literature.<br />And of course there are more classic Pratchett comedy set pieces.  The best of the bunch being when The Librarian (if you're not familiar with this wonderful creation, I'll tell you that the Librarian was magically transformed into an Ape, and never wanted to change back) tries to impart the name of a magic book, and can do so only through a hilarious game of charades.  Also, there are a series of scenes near the beginning where we are introduced to a secret underground brotherhood, made up of a gallery of dim disciples whose mistakes and pettiness nearly cause their leader to have a stroke.  And just try and use their secret password.  It's a wonder anyone manages to show up for the meetings!<br />This, along with the aforementioned &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, is the most complete of the Discworld books I've read.  It scores high marks for its comedy, parody, pop culture references (look for the Sam-Vimes-as-Sam-Spade clues subtly sprinkled throughout the narrative), action sequences, suspense, drama, and even its shadow of a love story.  I understand that there are at least four more books in the Watch series, and I can't wait to get at them.	2001-03-13
US	49333751	R21O4ZHJWISK5O	0552134619	226014260	Pyramids	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A fine parody of the ancients, just not near Pratchett's bes	\\"Pyramids\\" is an odd entry in the Discworld franchise.  It is neither a knock-you-down laugh riot, nor an existential meandering.  It has great dollops of both, though, and sometimes the two sides clash confusingly in the middle.  Other times, they fit together perfectly, like the large blocks that when stacked together make up a pyramid.<br />There are some classic Pratchett moments here.  Funny stuff.  Like when a doctor (medicine being a new artform on the Discworld) declares a man's temperature so hot you could fry an egg on his forehead.  Then, predicting the complicated medical jargon we all know and love, he pompously declares that the man is suffering from `Pyrocerebrum ouerf culinaire'.  A great and ridiculous moment.  Even better is the scene near the middle of the book, where our hero, Teppic, encounters the legendary Sphinx, and ends up debunking the logic behind its famous riddle.  It is a great scene, hardly integral to the plot, but wonderful to chomp on while it's playing.<br />As for that plot, well, Terry tries some complicated set pieces, and usually manages to pull them off with minimal explanation.  He lets the reader figure out the merits of the Assassin's Guild, what it means to inhume a client, the concept of &quot;flaring&quot; off a pyramid, camel mathematics, and &quot;quantum&quot; architecture.  Needless to say, none of these concepts are very useful in our world, but all make perfect sense on the Discworld.<br />I was somewhat disappointed that he returned to some tried and true devices.  The ghost of the dead king, used so well in &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, here comes off as a tired rehash (although the king's afterlife companions turn out to be an interesting bunch).  Also, the smart-mouth female sidekick has been done to death by this point.  And our hero seems to be just an amalgamation of every Discworld hero so far, from Rincewind to Twoflower to Mort to Rincewind (again).  Although Death returns, for a very brief but memorable appearance.<br />All told not the greatest entry in the series.  Terry aims the bar quite high, which I commend him for, but he manages to knock it down more times than not.	2001-03-06
US	49333751	R1IUT5P53WR9LH	0679753338	499546549	Nobody's Fool	Books	5	10	12	N	N	Lucky you, here's another great Russo book	After reading &quot;Straight Man&quot; I realized that Richard Russo had written one of my favourite books.  And now after reading &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;, not only has the man written *two* of my favourite books, but he has become one of my favourite authors.<br />So how does one best sum up the tone of a Richard Russo novel?  The best example I can come up with is this: there was a lot of grinning going on here. Carl Roebuck, the luckiest man in town who's married to the prettiest woman and having an endless series of affairs, perpetually wears a s**t-eating grin.  Peter, Sully's son who was just turned down for tenure and is nearing the end of an unhappy marriage, wears a very guarded ironic grin.  And Sully, who knows in his heart of hearts that no one can be this stupid but goes and does stupid thing after stupid thing, wears a sheepish grin of embarrassment.  The point being, really, is that even though these people are generally miserable living in a go nowhere town, they are always amused.  There is no more cathartic defense than laughter in the face of melancholy.<br />The book focuses on Sully, who, like &quot;Straight Man&quot;s Hank, is an aging man on the downswing of a wasted life.  Only he has so much vitality that you can't feel sorry for him.  Sure, he has a bum knee (which constantly provides him with a &quot;symphony of pain&quot;, a wonderful metaphor that Russo uses judiciously to great effect) and is in the middle of one of his vaunted 'stupid streaks', but he brings so much cheer to the people around him that the reader falls in love with him too.  Having seen the Paul Newman movie many times before ever having read the book, I was worried that the Sully Newman created would leave too indelible an image for Russo's prose to overcome.  Thankfully, that's not the case.  While both the written Sully and the cinematic Sully are definitely one and the same, Russo's opportunities to flesh out the man, to give him a personal and psychological history, are not wasted for a moment.  He is a very rich character, and, most importantly, never implausible.<br />Which is handy, because he is a virtual lightening rod of a main character.  He is surrounded (or is that 'surrounds himself'?) by a menagerie of adorable misfits, who all interact with him in their own wonderfully unique way.  Mrs. Beryl, his landlady, acts with all the maternal instinct she can muster, while knowing full well that her &quot;dangerous&quot; tenant is the only thing keeping her going in her old age.  Wirf, the one-legged drunken attorney shows some serious wisdom in that he usually knows Sully better than Sully knows himself.  Will, Sully's grandson, is a shy and scared boy who relishes the opportunity to finally get to know his grandfather.  And of course there's Rub.  Rub, Rub, Rub.  Russo's genius is never more apparent than in the creation of this painful portrait.  Rub smells.  He hates his wife.  He is constantly wishing for things, but never too much above his station.  He is threatened by Sully's son honing in on his turf.  He is stupid.  And he is lazy.  But his relationship with Sully is quite tender.  It is brilliant because so many things are said between these two men via simple subtext, and even though there is a constant barrage of insults, Sully's affection for his partner should never be less than apparent.  These two make a great comic team.<br />Once again, Russo shows that he is a samurai with dialogue.  He has an amazing ability to give working class heroes quick minds and sharp tongues, all the while making their conversation fluid and very natural.  He also has an intense gift for subtly implying sarcasm, which is an awful tough thing to do on paper because meaning usually gets lost in the translation.  In the mouths of Russo's characters, the irony comes through loud and clear.  It is a joy to read these passages.<br />&quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; is a surprisingly long book, considering that the narrative is quite bare.It is really nothing more than a fortnight-long dissection of Sully's bad luck.  What carries the day is that these people, in this town, are very real and very fascinating.  I was never disappointed at any time, and that's an awful tough thing to do.  Another trip down one of Russo's paths will be most welcome.	2001-03-01
US	49333751	RYGSBYFNH28H0	0345371984	913643876	Last Chance to See	Books	5	95	97	N	N	A hitchhiker's guide to the animal kingdom	Douglas Adams' sense of humour is so strong, it could inject a bucketful of laughs into an obituary.  Needless to say I wasn't surprised when this book, his elegy for endangered species, turned out to have a welcome balance between laughter and melancholy.<br />Adams is joined by zoologist Mark Carwardine, as they use their last chance to see a variety of animals on the brink of extinction, such as the Komodo Dragon, the White Rhinos of Zaire, New Zealand kakapos, and Yangtze river dolphins.  Adams, amateur wildlife lover, is wise enough to know the purpose of his journey: to shine some of the glare from his celebrity as a \\"science-fiction comedy novelist\\" on the issue of global extinction.  He does wisely not to downplay the plight of these animals in the favour of commerciality, but manages to produce an entertaining work nonetheless.  Carwardine, and the other people we encounter, sometimes come off as little more than characters in a Douglas Adams novel.  I am hesitant to believe that everyone he encounters has the same dry, deadpanned British sense of humour.  Nonetheless, the characters' eccentricities further shed light on the kinds of people who are willing to undertake the monumental task of saving these beautiful beasts.  It is not work for the dispassionate.  <br />\\"The great thing about being the only species that makes a distinction between right and wrong,\\" he notes at one point, \\"is that we can make up the rules for ourselves as we go along.\\"  Which brings up the second theme he hopes to illustrate here.  Humans are dumb.  No, that's too simple.  Humans are egotistical, selfish, wasteful, materialistic, impudent, and dumb.  The single, overwhelming reason why most of these animals must fight for their survival is the sheer audacity humans have in moving into their natural habitat, and upsetting the balance of nature.  Adams has no time for individual moments of human idiocy, best exemplified by his wonderful line skewering young Yemeni men who insiston wearing rhino tusk costume jewelry: \\"How do you persuade [them] that a rhino horn dagger is not a symbol of your manhood but a signal of the fact that you need such a symbol?\\"  His exasperation is evident in this and other such pearls of prose.<br />I admit that I read this book more for Adams himself than for the subject matter.  It is a credit to the author that by the end, I felt some sense of emotional investment in the animals, without the bitter feelings that usually emanate whenever I am subject to an overt tug at my heartstrings.  Adams walks that fine line quite well.	2001-02-17
US	49333751	R1LJ2B0JQXR9NW	0552134600	260706411	Wyrd Sisters (A Discworld Novel)	Books	5	38	39	N	N	A book where men may read strange matters (1.5.63-4)	Like Tom Stoppard (amongst others) before him, Terry Pratchett has re-written Shakespeare, shifting focus to a group of secondary characters.  Where Stoppard switches the hub of &quot;Hamlet&quot; to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Pratchett uses &quot;Macbeth&quot;s three witches, the so-called &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;.  He also replaces Scotland with a giant, interstellar Discworld, perched atop four gigantic elephants, who are themselves perched atop an even more giant turtle.  Needless to say, Shakespeare's original does not come away unscathed.<br />Pratchett tosses around numerous parodic references to &quot;Macbeth&quot; (i.e., the opening scene where an eerie voice asks, &quot;When shall we three meet again?&quot; and a deadpan voice replies &quot;Well, I can do next Tuesday&quot;; people are constantly seeing daggers before them, or at least thinking they do).  It should be noted that a familiarity with the original text is not important to your enjoyment here.  I haven't read the play in about five years, and still caught enough to stay with the joke.  References to other plays abound as well.  &quot;Hamlet&quot; (a tightfisted theatre director decrees that &quot;the pay's the thing&quot;, then swiftly corrects himself), &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and &quot;Richard III&quot; are all prominently featured and lampooned.<br />&quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; also features the finest example of an ensemble cast so far seen in any of the Discworld books.  Each character is distinct and interesting, not to mention integral to the plot.  My favourites include: Tomjon, the unknown heir who is a great example of how a passion for the theatre can stand side-by-side with more conventional magic; Hwel (Will?), a dwarf playwright, who at one point almost invents the stage personas of the Marx Brothers (yay!), Laurel &amp; Hardy, and Charlie Chaplin; Granny Weatherwax, who first appeared in &quot;Equal Rites&quot; and now has her own odd but endearing coven to deal with; Verence, late King of Lancre, who is doomed to hang around his old castle as a frustrated and ineffectual ghost; and Greebo, a cat best described as a feline rapist, for his prodigious spreading of the seed.  But my favourite character is The Fool, a Shakespearean staple given a surprising amount of depth here.  The Fool is allowed to feel love and despair, the former for the young witch Magrat, and the latter for his fated placement in a job that he despises.  Normally a device for exposition, here The Fool is a full-fledged, living and breathing character.  A wonderful creation.<br />To me, this is the first in the series which gets all the elements right.  Pratchett throws in enough references to keep fans of those continually happy.  He has created an eclectic and fascinating cast of characters.  And fashioned a story that is involving, complex, intriguing, funny, and supremely entertaining.  It's not the proper place to start your journey through the Discworld, but for those of you amongst the initiated, don't make the mistake of skipping &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;.	2001-02-13
US	49333751	RTUWPZRI4CBBC	0140237194	523767082	Albert Einstein: A Biography	Books	3	11	19	N	N	Gets his life right, but the science is too dense for me	Albert Einstein led an interesting life, from his beginnings as a mathematical prodigy, to his heyday when he popularized physics, to his old age where his status as a living legend afforded him many opportunities. Folsing does a great job detailing Einstein the man in each of these sections. Generally he uses Einstein's own writings, either in letters or in papers, a technique that some find off-putting but I found useful and relevant.<br />Two things about this book, though, did trouble me. First, it was overlong. There were some sections that felt either redundant or padded, and did little to provide further insight into Einstein the man. Second, the physics explanations went over my head. As a layman, I wasn't expecting a dumbed-down approach meant to pander to the dimmest of readers. I do have some math background, and usually take to the subject easily. But Folsing never gave me a chance. I went in hoping for some comprehensible explanations regarding the special and general theories of relativity, but got nothing more than page after page of jargon that assumed plenty of prior knowledge. Even an explanation of why they (along with the equation \\"E=mc2\\") received critical and popular acclaim was missing.<br />Now, I'm willing to concede that something got lost in the translation, for the book was originally written in German. Folsing is by trade a physicist, and later a science journalist, so should know his stuff and have the skills needed for concise explanation. I suppose it was enough to ask that he attempt to share some of his knowledge of Einstein's science, while making Einstein's life a gripping and interesting tale.	2001-02-10
US	49333751	R2XGYFBS3MUQ2W	0385333501	121956424	Welcome to the Monkey House: A Collection of Short Works	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Some sci-fi, some character study, but all Vonnegut	Unlike his later novels (\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\", \\"Bluebeard\\", \\"Jailbird\\"), where he utilized a biting economical style, the short stories in this collection are comprised of a more standard prose.  That being said, they are still Kurt Vonnegut stories, and thus offer a mixture of radical sci-fi ideas and character creation that goes down just as easily in smaller chunks as it does in the longer novel form.<br />The stories here that made his reputation as a sci-fi writer (a reputation that doesn't come close to covering his oeuvre) are startling in their originality and awe-inspiring in their execution.  `Harrison Bergeron' is a quick drawing of a \\"utopian\\" society, where the strong and smart wear handicaps to level the playing field. Vonnegut manages to create a unique world, and then destroy it, while saying much about our world.  I'm sure anyone who has seen the film version of this story wonders why they tried to stretch it out to an hour and a half, when all was already said in those seven pages.  The title story is another futuristic utopia, where overpopulation has created the need for voluntary suicide clinics and a complete repression of sexual desire.  It's a society ripe for rebellion, and that's just what it gets.  `Unready to Wear' follows a society in which those who have learned to transcend their physical bodies are at odds with those who haven't.  None of these tales follows any long, drawn out narrative.  They all tend to make their point, quickly, and move on with other business.  Vonnegut never gets lost in his creations, or bogged down in trying to make them sound credible.  He has an incredible knack for simplicity within complex ideas.<br />There are other stories here besides the sci-fi tales.  My favourite is `Miss Temptation', which shows us a small town, mesmerized by the daily walk up Main Street of a hermit-like woman of startling beauty.  The twist near the end is heartbreaking, and manages to not only indict the characters in the storyfor their objectification, it indicts the reader as well.  `More Stately Mansions' is a tale of modern suburbia, which says something about one woman's obsession with decorating, as well as all of our obsessions with `looking the part'.  `All the King's Horses' is loaded with dramatic tension, as an American Army Colonel, captured by a Communist guerrilla chief during the Vietnam war, is forced to play chess using his battalion and his family as pieces.  Any captured pieces are executed.  Besides the tension of the game, Vonnegut manages to slip in some criticism of xenophobia.<br />These stories are just a few of my favourites.  The book is filled with wonderful pieces, each of equal strength, all showcasing Vonnegut's early-career skills as a writer.	2001-02-10
US	49333751	R11ISPSD3RH0BV	0552131075	469869447	Sourcery	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Inspiration hits its target again	\\"I get vertigo just listening to tall stories,\\" says the inept wizard Rincewind at one point.  He'd have a serious Jimmy Stewart moment if he ever tried to make his way through this story.  It's classic Pratchett and classic Discworld for sure.  But not as well developed as the previous books in the series.<br />Pratchett concocts a menacing figure in Coin, the 9-year old eighth son of an eighth son (making him a sourcerer) who comes to Unseen University (where wizards learn their trade) in an attempt to rule the world.  But Coin's magic, which we are to believe is all-powerful, comes off as little more than glorified parlour tricks.  Not really menacing at all.  Still, the sniveling cowards the make up the elite professors of the university are a treat to read about, and save most of those scenes.<br />Rincewind returns, after dominating \\"The Colour of Magic\\" and \\"The Light Fantastic\\" while making a brief cameo appearance in \\"Mort\\".  Here, he has a history of unwanted adventures behind him, and Pratchett uses this world-weariness to give Rincewind a cool demeanor that he didn't have in the other books.  Sure, he's still cynical and pessimistic and cowardly, but with a touch of the fatalist about him.  Without that addition, the character would become stagnant and boring.  Kudos to Terry for an inspired bit of tweaking.  On the other hand, Rincewind's constant companion The Luggage is little more than window-dressing here.  He (it?) doesn't really do much, except remind us of his (its?) finer moments in previous books.  Joining these two Discworld staples on their adventure are Conina the Barbarian (remember her father Cohen from \\"The Light Fantastic\\"?), a warrior princess who'd rather be working in a salon; Nijel (the Destroyer son of Harebut the Provision Merchant if you please) who learned about being a hero from a book, and is on his first gig here; and Creosote, an ignorant sovereign who's more concerned with poetry and drink than ruling his kingdom.  Also, watch out for the run-in with a lamp genie that sets new standards for parody, and the continuing development of the character of the Librarian, who gets to do much more than chomp bananas and say \\"Ook\\".<br />\\"Sourcery\\" is probably the weakest overall of the Discworld books I've read so far.  That being said, it's still a fine and fun adventure filled with many humourous moments, and well worth the read.	2001-02-03
US	49333751	RRN3EYKYR0OG3	0552131067	116769240	Mort	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Death takes a holiday	The word on the street is that Pratchett flew out of the gate with this series, hit a downward slide, and then took his time settling back into the Discworld groove.  'Mort', book number four, strikes me as the beginning of the downward slide.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fun book, filled with imagination, humour, drama, and rich characters.  But it doesn't do much to further this author's reputation.<br />In terms of narrative, it actually bears a strong resemblance to book #2, 'The Light Fantastic'.  In both stories, a supernatural entity slowly moves towards destroying the Discworld (or at least altering it in unimaginable ways).  However, the red star from 'Light' is much more menacing than the device Pratchett conjures up here.  It's an &quot;interface&quot;, representing a thwarted reality, threatening to correct a mistake.  My powers of explanation don't do it justice, I know, but Pratchett's do.  It's an interesting concoction, but hardly menacing enough to justify the dramatic suspense it's meant to carry.  That's really my only complaint here.<br />The strength of the Discworld series is that Pratchett is a master at taking a simple premise (e.g., What if the wizard charged with saving the world couldn't perform any spells?  How would the first female wizard be treated?) and fleshing it out over the length of an enjoyable book.  Here, he asks: What would happen if Death took a holiday (an allusion to the movie that inspired 'Meet Joe Black')?  Well, we certainly get an answer.  And yes, Pratchett's sense of humour is intact.  Witness his description of Mort's (Death's apprentice) duties in the horse stables:  &quot;Some jobs offer increments.  This one offered -- well, quite the reverse.&quot;  I was knocked backwards when I caught that one!  It's the kind of joke that shows Pratchett's verbal dexterity, as well as his complete trust that his audience will be paying attention.<br />Pratchett's real achievement is his depiction of the afterworld. Death's lair uses the same cliched symbols we've all seen before (hourglasses show how much time everyone has left to live; a library features instantaneously self-updating books representing all individual's life narratives; Death is a skeleton in a black cloak, wielding a menacing scythe).  But it compares favourably with Albert Brooks' movie 'Defending Your Life' for its quite ingenious and original (and wonderfully self-referential) rendering of the mechanics of death.	2001-01-19
US	49333751	R1B4Y4D6E48MN5	0375701907	635714194	Straight Man: A Novel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Lucky you, here's a great book	&quot;I do not now, and did not then consider myself a curmudgeon, but I can play that role,&quot; says William Henry Devereaux, Jr., narrator and protagonist.  He later makes this same claim about his status as a chauvinist, innocent, and misogynist.  But don't believe it.  He is a lovable curmudgeon to the core, and those of you who are familiar with my other reviews should know by now that this is my most favourite of literary character types.  And Hank 'plays' the role divinely.  He is definitely one of my new favourite characters in any book, being wry and detached, a s--t disturber par excellence.  He reminds me a lot of the title character in Kingsley Amis' book &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; (also set amongst the blowhards of academia).  No wonder his chief rival has saddled him with the nickname 'Lucky Hank'.  But Hank is more proactive, and ferocious, than poor Jim (A tangential note: I think Hank is pretty close to the way Martin Amis would have ended up, if &quot;The Rachel Papers&quot; had not been a success).  Edging up on fifty years, he has had ample time and opportunity to learn how to push the buttons of those around him.<br />And those around him are finely drawn as well.  Russo has done a magnificent job populating his little world (mainly the English department of a B-level College in a small, Pennsylvanian town) with characters that jump off the page.  Whether they are major secondary characters, or one scene wonders, each seems tragically real.  You really get an opportunity to know these people, although it's always through the cynical gaze of Hank's eyes.  But he has such awesome powers of perception and communication that it seems more than enough to get the full picture.<br />The narrative, which slowly moves towards Hank being removed from his position as English department chair, is simple and quite appealing.  But its simplicity is deceiving, William of Occam -- whose razor Hank holds up as the ideal -- notwithstanding.  You see, Hank teaches aclass in composition.  There are some wonderful scenes of him in front of his class, trying to show them the proper way to build narrative suspense, how a story should have symmetry, how 'A' should lead to 'B' and then to 'C', and effective uses of metaphor and simile.  His inner criticisms of other stories, told by his colleague Teddy and his father-in-law Angelo echo these classes.  In this way, Russo challenges himself to abide by those rules of storytelling, while not producing something formulaic and expected.  In my humble opinion, he pulls off this paradox magnificently.  And on top of that, he writes dialogue that is fresh, alive, witty, and challenging, while never appearing forced or contrived.  I am in awe of this man's talents as a writer.<br />The other main thrust of the story centres on the return of Hank's father, William Henry Devereaux, Sr. (It is a measure of this man's stature in Hank's life that he always refers to himself and his father using their whole names).  An academic legend, he walked out on Hank and his mom years ago, and now is not long for this world.  The scene depicting their reunion is heartbreaking without being maudlin, and once again shows Russo's deftness with character and dialogue.  He conveys much information about these two men, without having to say much at all.<br />The only flaw in the book, as far as I can tell, is that Russo doesn't completely trust his readers to recall important events and characters from earlier in the book.  He repeatedly adds reminders of who or what he is referring to, ostensibly to make sure we miss nothing.  This constant handholding got tiresome after a while.  But like I said, that is the book's only flaw.  The rest of it is funny, endearing, educational, emotional, and above all entertaining.	2001-01-11
US	49333751	R3PETNQTWMPU7A	0061020699	863190678	Equal Rites	Books	4	10	10	N	N	A story about magic	Pratchett seems to love the character dynamic between the Curmudgeon and the Innocent, when both are working together towards the same goals.  He used this to great effect with Rincewind and Twoflower in the first two books of his Discworld series, and it pops up again here.<br />Granny Weatherwax (the curmudgeon) is a witch.  She is charged with steering 8-year old Esk towards wizardry.  Only Esk is a girl, and as we all know, girls can't be wizards.  She was supposed to be the eighth son of an eighth son, but somebody messed up the paperwork.  It is this conflict that is central to the book.  Pratchett does a nice job lampooning the (perceived) differences between men and women (i.e., practical vs. intuitive knowledge; book study vs. study of nature, etc.) that exist in our world, transporting them to his own imagined landscape.  That's to be expected from a book punnishly titled \\"Equal Rites\\".  On top of that, we get a cunning parody of institutes of higher learning.  Unseen University (where boys go to become wizards) and its hierarchy of learned scholars knocks the stuffing out of scholastic life.<br />All the Pratchett devices are back for another run through the ringer.  Along with the above mentioned character types, we also have some silly humour (a group of marzipan ducks magically anthropomorphize, only to melt when they take to the river; \\"that's natural selection for you,\\" comments the cheeky narrator).  And another inanimate object without a face inexplicably manages to make facial expressions.  Twoflower's Luggage has an heir apparent in Esk's magic staff.  Some comments I've read state that Pratchett relies too heavily on these devices in later books.  Well, it's only three books into the series, and I still find them fresh and interesting.  Time will tell, though.<br />While not as laugh-out-loud funny as its predecessors, \\"Equal Rites\\" moves along its narrative with much more force.  Which still makes it an entertaining read.  Still, here's hoping that Pratchett managed to combine the two in equal proportions as the series went along.that Pratchett managed to combine the two in equal proportions as the series went along.	2000-12-30

Like \\"Godfather II\\" before it, \\"The Light Fantastic\\" is that rare sequel that improves upon the original.  Not a difficult task here, as \\"The Colour of Magic\\" was, while being intensely imaginative, sprawling and largely unfocused.  Here, Pratchett concocts a story with as much linear thrust as the strange red star that threatens to ram into the Discworld.  Needless to say, the only person who can save the world is Rincewind, that scaredy-cat wizard who doesn't know any spells (well, he knows one spell... or at least he knows where to find that spell).  He is cynical as ever, and funny too.  Once again he is joined by the world's first tourist, Twoflower, who is an even more hyped-up innocent here than in \\"The Colour of Magic\\".  I still love the relationship between these two great characters.  Rincewind is in constant sarcasm mode, while Twoflower takes everything he hears at face value.  There are some wonderfully comic misunderstandings between these two.  Throw in Twoflower's ever-loyal Luggage, and we've got a threesome for the ages.<br />Once again Pratchett populates his world with ridiculous characters (Cohen the Barbarian, an 80-year old hero whose legend is in his own lifetime) and marvelous groan-worthy puns (What do you call an angry mob robbing a music store?  Luters...) that make this an entertaining fantasy parody from page one.  And on top of that, he throws in some neat meta-fiction too.  When introducing Herrena the Henna-Haired Harridan, a warrior heroine, he implores whomever is to draw the cover of the book to resist the urge to dress her up in \\"something off the cover of the more advanced kind of lingerie catalogue for the specialized buyer\\".  It just wouldn't be practical in her line of work.  And the swarthy men she rides with?  Well, they're going to die sooner or later, so let's not bother getting to know them.  It's a wonderful moment of self-awareness.<br />Is it necessary to read \\"The Colour of Magic\\" before \\"The Light Fantastic\\"?  I think so.  If only to get a better idea of the characters, and their predispositions.  And that's really what these stories are about: character.  How can a pack of seemingly ordinary innocents save the world?

US	49333751	RB6W1LYBX2ZLZ	067188428X	818314744	R L's Dream	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Love in vain	I enjoyed this book while I was reading it.  I really did.  Even through the descriptions of Soupspoon's pain and squalor -- which came close to turning my stomach -- I still wanted to know what would happen to this old bluesman.  But when I wasn't reading it, I dreaded picking it up again.  I remembered how it reminded me of (and amplified) my own pain and sorrow, and didn't really want to go back to that place again.  But I eventually did, every time, and somehow feel the better for it.  It's kind of like a blues song that way, in that it can simultaneously sadden and cheer you at the same time.<br />The relationship between it's main characters is key.  Atwater &quot;Soupspoon&quot; Wise is dying of cancer, and wants an opportunity to record his story for posterity.  That story encompasses the history of the Delta Blues, and features prominently the great Robert Johnson (Robert Leroy, the RL of the title).  He is rescued from penilessness and homelessness by Kiki, a stranger in his building.  Kiki has her own problems to deal with (including her alcoholism and her tortured past), but sees enough in Soupspoon to arouse her compassion.  They make for an odd, but interesting couple.  This is all serviced by Mosley's simple and lightly poetic prose.  He does a wonderful job conjuring up images and emotions using the sparest of sentences.<br />If given my druthers, I would have liked to spend more time exploring Soupspoon's history, especially the legend of Robert Johnson.  I know that not much is known about him, but it might have been fascinating if Mosley tried his hand at hypothesizing even more than he already does.  Without that, the story becomes a requiem for Soupspoon, where the crux of the suspense hinges on whether or not he'll get his history recorded before inevitably succumbing to cancer.  His end manages to be both sad and uplifting.  Kind of like a blues song.	2000-12-22
US	49333751	R181I0MQNBECDQ	0552124753	181852028	The colour of Magic	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A fine mess	In the prologue to chapter two, Pratchett writes a description of his fictional world that doubles as an interesting piece of self-analysis: &quot;The discworld offers sights far more impressive than those found in universes built by Creators with less imagination but more mechanical aptitude.&quot;  I couldn't agree more.<br />To begin with, there is something extremely beautiful and awe-inspiring in the construction of the world itself: a giant terrestrial disc, perched upon the backs of four giant elephants, perched upon the back of an even more giant interstellar and androgynous turtle.  From the get go, we know that our author-guide is blessed with a prodigious imagination.  And his characters are fascinating; they are quirky in the best of ways.  Rincewind, the failed wizard with one spell that even he doesn't know the effect of, is a curmudgeon of the highest order.  But bless his heart, his will to live is extraordinary.  He is paired with a wealthy tourist named Twoflower, who possesses a wide-eyed innocence perfect for leading our introduction to this made-up world.  These two, along with Twoflower's Luggage (a chest made of &quot;sapient pearwood&quot; with dozens of determined legs -- ha-ha!), are a great 'Laurel and Hardy'-style duo (&quot;That's another fine mess you got me into,&quot; says Rincewind at one point).  They are comic and bumbling, with a lovable chemistry.<br />The story, as some others have said, is less than focused.  There are some sparkling scenes, but the overall narrative is rather flimsy.  That's fine seeing as this is the first book in the series, and exposition should take precedence over story.  But things do get confusing at times.  Regardless, it is a fun ride.  I've got the next two books sitting on top of my reading pile, and I can't wait to get at them.	2000-12-18
US	49333751	R12LIO24HFH96N	0684848155	553694758	Underworld: A Novel	Books	4	4	7	N	N	&quot;Om does not rhyme with bomb.  It only looks that way.&quot;	Before I begin detailing some of its problems, I just wanted to say that I enjoyed 'Underworld'.  DeLillo's use of language is prolific, routinely producing interesting epigrams like the one noted above.  And I never felt like giving up once during its 800+ pages, which is shocking.  The reason for that is there's so much going on here that I always found something interesting in the next section.  But therein lies one of its major downfalls.  DeLillo has written the start of about 6 or 7 interesting novels, largely focused on the theme of Cold War paranoia/anxiety, pasted together haphazardly to create a whole that is not greater than the sum of its parts.<br />I guess part of the problem is that the connective tissues are fragile.  Yes, there is a famous baseball that pops up over and over, paralleling the existence of nuclear weapons.  And all of the characters are associated in one way or another.  But when an author makes a claim that everything is connected, I want those connections to jump up and slap me in the face.  The ones produced here seemed unbelievable, almost too coincidental.  If I saw them with my own eyes, in real life, I might believe.  But in this piece of fiction, they seem highly contrived.  It occurs to me that the film 'Magnolia' had many of the same problems.  I suppose if you liked that movie (I didn't), you'll accept 'Underworld' too.<br />Most of the attention 'Underworld' gets revolves around the prologue, set at the famous 1951 playoff game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants.  Being an amateur baseball historian, I was looking forward to these scenes with glee.  And for the most part, DeLillo does a wonderful job, ably skipping from the action on the field, to the action in Russ Hodges' broadcast booth, to a fantastical sequence in the stands (where Sinatra, Gleason, J. Edgar Hoover, and Toots Shore trade barbs and bodily fluids!).  He moves between these scenes effortlessly and poetically.  Unfortunately, the whole thing felt a little too over-researched and forced, resulting in an emotional coldness that lasts for most of the rest of the book. <br />The Lenny Bruce scenes are probably the best things here.  I don't know what it was like seeing Lenny live in his heyday, but DeLillo produces an entertaining facsimile.  He does a fine job depicting what's going on in Lenny's head and what comes out of his mouth while onstage.  And he manages to tell much more by just describing the club settings and its patrons.  Also fine are the (non-Polo Ground) scenes featuring J. Edgar Hoover and his &quot;companion&quot;.  Again, we get an interesting glimpse into Hoover's inner workings, his fears, his paranoias, and his obsessions.  And there's a great scene where he goes to Truman Capote's Black and White ball.  Both of these mid-twentieth century icons are utilized to great effect.  <br />In the other DeLillo book I've read, 'White Noise', he clearly defines his characters and their roles.  They are all interesting and essential to that book's central themes.  It is one of my favourite books.  Here, the Dramatis Personae reads like a phone book: names in abundance, with mostly anonymous identities.  The reader is given a difficult task getting to know any of them.  Even the de facto protagonists Nick and Klara (nominated as such based solely on the fact that they are name-checked in the back cover blurb) are barely recognizably as anything more than rhetorical devices.<br />And speaking of rhetorical devices, DeLillo prominently uses (at least) two that baffled me.  First, when someone is cut-off mid-sentence, their speech is still concluded with a period.  As if the thought was complete.  And second, he takes great pains in keeping the identity of a new scene ambiguous for as long as possible.  I know that there is a concrete reason for both of these, but for the life of me I can't figure it out.  Unless, of course, they're meant to be distracting and off-putting.  Not as off-putting was the reverse time structure (where &quot;things move indelibly into the past&quot;).  It dominated the book, and was used successfully.<br />So, yeah, there is much good here.  And like I said, I did enjoy the book overall.  It's definitely worth the effort.  And I appreciate the effort DeLillo made in writing it.  I only wish that he had achieved the perfection that a book of this size and of this subject deserves.	2000-12-14
US	49333751	R32IQEDKZ9VL2K	0060175966	418849151	The Professor and the Madman	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Lexicography as Obsession	This book is marketed as a Victorian thriller, a \\"tale\\" of murder and intrigue and mystery and suspense.  It is hardly that at all.  True, there is much that is fascinating here, but it never shapes itself around a narrative.  Rather, it is a book about obsession.  Or, more specifically, how there is a thin that line bisects obsession.<br />On one side of that line, obsession can become a powerful instrument of good, where man can create marvels.  Professor James Murray, the man who spearheaded the Oxford English Dictionary project, stands firmly on this side of the line.  He is a towering figure, as portrayed here, and his obsession is the completion of the dictionary.  It becomes his life's work, or rather, his life's work plus a half.  For he died before its completion.  His story is fascinating, for it at once encompasses the story of a brilliant man, as well as the story lexicography (which I found just as, if not more, interesting).<br />On the other side of the line, obsession can destroy.  Dr. W.C. Minor's paranoia stems from his days in the Civil War.  Eventually, it leads to a homicide, for which he is institutionalized for the better portion of his life.  His days locked up are depicted as quite gritty, and then at other times as quite comfortable.  But the true nature of his mental unbalance is not revealed until a moment of self-mutilation that is quite uncomfortable to think about now, let alone read about.  And yet he is saved by his obsession.  For he contributes over 10,000 words to the dictionary, making him more than just an inmate, but a valuable human being.<br />Winchester does a wonderful job relaying the stories of these two men, and how their obsessions gripped their lives.  And he gives great deference to the OED itself, outlining its history with precision and flair.  I guarantee that when finished reading this slight book, you'll want to rush out and order the twenty volumes of that monumental, and obsessive, work.	2000-12-07

It seems that the Antichrist has been switched at birth.  This bizarre beginning, seemingly straight out of a Three Stooges movie, is how Pratchett and Gaiman skillfully set up this engrossing comic parable.<br />Aziraphale (an Angel) and Crowley (a Fallen Angel, who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards) are in charge of finding the Antichrist, now an eleven year old boy.  They are an unlikely pair, more loyal to each other than their respective afterworlds.  Aziraphale owns a rare bookshop, specializing in books of prophecy and turning away customers.  Crowley drives a vintage Bentley, whose stereo changes any inserted cassette into the music of Queen.  These two were my favourite characters, perfectly epitomizing the cautious relationship between good and evil, Heaven and Hell.  And they head an impressive Dramatis Personae of wonderfully conceived characters: there's Adam Young and his gang (&quot;the Them&quot;) slowly coming to grips with his newfound powers; there's Newt and Shadwell, bungling witchfinders; and there's even Agnes Nutter, in absentia, who's seemingly having the most fun of the lot.<br />One of my favourite sequences involves the introduction of the Four Horsemen... er... Horsepersons... or rather Bikerpersons of the Apocalypse.  It's a very subtle and beautifully conceived scene that doesn't come right out and explain who we are being introduced to.  We are not formally presented with DEATH, War, Famine and Pollution (Pestilence retired in 1937).  Rather, we are slowly given clues as to what the scene is about, and who the important characters are.  It's a fantastic scene that rewards the reader who pays close attention to detail.  And on top of that, it leads into a ludicrously comic scene about four other bikers -- Hell's Angels, the human kind, there to witness the Four's reconvening -- who decide to tag along.  They also decide to give themselves appropriate names:<br />Big Ted screwed up his face with the effort of thought.  'GBH,' he said, eventually.  'I'm Grievous Bodily Harm.  That's me.  There.  Wott're you going to be?'  'Can I be Rubbish?' asked Skuzz.  'Or Embarrassing Personal Problems?'<br />It goes on and on like this, and is terribly funny.<br />A helpful hint: When reading excerpts from Agnes Nutter's prophecies, pay special attention to the margin notes.  There is much humour in these random thoughts from Anathema's (the keeper of the book) ancestors.  Further proof that Gaiman and Pratchett really know how to pack substance into their marginalia.  Other instances of this: varied fonts are used to indicate the authority of certain speakers (DEATH speaks in capitals, while Aziraphale trapped in the body of a medium speaks in italics); the goofy and tangential footnotes that crop up every once in a while, and are a ridiculous treat.<br />At times, the narrative felt a little too broad, almost unfocused.  This problem is neatly tied up in the end, but for awhile I wondered if the two authors had problems deciding on a consensual plot.  This is my first time reading a book of dual authorship, and overall I'd say they did a good job of keeping the story (which could very well have careened off into a messy shambles) quite coherent.  And this is a good time to ask those with more information than me: how much of this is Pratchett and how much is Gaiman?  It is my understanding that the Douglas-Adams-style bits are the work of Pratchett (and it does hold up well against Adams' work), and the Armageddon-on-acid parts are Gaiman's.  Regardless, there is enough evidence here to suggest that I'll enjoy my first foray into Pratchett's 'Discworld', coming soon.<br />And watch for the charmingly brief cameo by God, feeding ducks by a pond.	2000-11-30
US	49333751	R16NZ1RU9BPVOD	0375724834	352044771	Motherless Brooklyn	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A fine parody (&quot;ALPINE CHARITY, EATMEBAILEY...&quot;)	Excuse the above.  Couldn't hold it in any longer...<br />&quot;Have you ever felt, in the course of reading a detective novel, a guilty thrill of relief at having a character murdered before he can step onto the page and burden you with his actual existence?&quot; Lionel Essrog, the narrator, asks about a third of the way through this book.  Up to that point, it was reasonable to assume that Lethem would play his detective story straight.  But this question ups the ante a touch.  It was at this point that I worried Lethem would take the path worn by Paul Auster (see his brilliant 'New York Trilogy') where the elements of the hard-boiled detective novel would be used purely for the sake of post-modernism.  Auster's detectives never solve their crimes, and frankly, it doesn't matter.  His ideas are bountiful enough for the reader to hold on to.  Lethem, on the other hand, needs his narrative resolution.  His ideas aren't in Auster's league.  Sure, he sprinkles some Zen Buddhism over here, and questions of identity over there, and his main character has a disease that borders on the stream of consciousness style that contemporary literati find so intriguing (I don't).  But they just don't have the same weight.  Thankfully -- and I worry here that I'm giving away too much of the ending -- he follows the genre's conventions just enough to keep the reader happy.<br />There's a great line near the middle of the book, when a patron in a restaurant, complaining of Lionel's use of a cell phone in a public place, says: &quot;people talking to themselves in a public place like they got some kind of illness!&quot;  Lionel, narrator and protagonist, is a wonderful creation.  His Tourette's Syndrome, which at first came off as a hackneyed device, actually serves to elevate the entire book.  It was wonderful to hear the series of Tourettic thoughts going through his head, and what the final culmination of those thoughts were when they would eventually escape through his mouth.  Ioften thought that if the people he was speaking too were any brighter, then Lionel's cover would be consistently blown because you always knew what his hidden thoughts were.  Luckily, the &quot;Minna Men&quot; he hung with were as low rent as the detective agency they worked for.<br />Lethem does a good job creating his world, his seedy little section of Brooklyn (and its outskirts, and even a sidetrip to Maine) for his characters to roam around in.  The details seem just right, if a little self-conscious at times (a minor character is named &quot;Welcome&quot;, a byproduct of her hippie parents but really of no use to the story).  He takes the classic detective genre, and adds elements from the '90's to make it more relevant (like a &quot;soundtrack&quot; peppered with Funkadelic, Boyz II Men, and most tellingly, Prince).  And you've got to admire an author who has the confidence to begin a chapter: &quot;There once was a girl from Nantucket.  No, really, that's where she was from.&quot;	2000-11-23

As a frothy, comic satire of post-war British academia, it fares quite well.  Amis' depictions of Old Man Welch as a staggering boob and a loathsome bore are spot-on.  He gets the details just right here.  Same goes for Welch's infuriatingly pretentious family (foppish painter son and overbearing wife).  As for the title character, Mr. Dixon's interior dialogues are hilarious, when contrasted with the lines he actually says aloud.  He lives quite an entertaining and vitriolic Walter-Mitty-style inner life.  Some of the punishments he fantasizes about cooking up for Welch are delightful in their venom.<br />The problem I have with the book is that none of it made a lick of difference.  Sure, it is nearly forty years since its first publication, but I just can't help feeling that this terrain has been done with more relevance by someone like Robertson Davies (see his 'Cornish Trilogy').  His pretentious academics actually manage to be fully formed characters, instead of the crudely drawn sketches Amis depicts here.<br />That being said, the prose is magnificent.

That later character, however, spends an inordinate amount of time in the theatre.  It is here that Callow lost me.  Although I understand the need for these scenes (and some of them are rip-roaring good yarns), they sometimes come across as addendums to a larger book on the history of theatre that Callow is writing, rather than have any relevance to Orson's life.  He tends to get over excited, going into too much detail about the most minor productions of Welles' career.  Yes, his modern dress 'Julius Caesar' and the rest of the Mercury Theatre's first season were groundbreaking, but do we really need a whole chapter devoted to 'Shoemaker's Holiday' and 'Heartbreak House'?  Those of you with passion for the theatre, its history, and various theories of acting will eat up these sections (comprising a good two thirds of the book), but for those of us anxious to get to the 'Kane' scenes, they are merely delaying the inevitable.<br />As for those 'Kane' scenes, Callow does yeomen's work debunking the myths that went into the production of that particular masterpiece.  Mankiewicz, Toland, Schaefer, and Hearst are all heard from (in one way or another) in a way that makes Welles' contributions to that picture much clearer.  My one complaint is that this section didn't dominate the book the way I hoped it would have.  I suspect that in the title of his book, Mr. Callow wanted to emphasize &quot;The Road&quot; over &quot;Xanadu&quot;; that is his prerogative, but not my preference.<br />Overall, Welles comes off as a man whose talents justified the hype surrounding them.  Also, he appears to be guided by fate.  For as Callow points out time after time, just when things could have stagnated, a figure appears in Welles' life at just the right time to propel him along a fruitfulpath.  From Skipper Hill, to John Houseman, to Gregg Toland, the pattern holds true.  Someone, or something, appears to have wanted the prodigy to grow up to direct the world's greatest motion picture.  And he did.  Callow promises that a second volume is in the works, presumable one that will chronicle Welles' decline into artistic irrelevance and obesity.  I am looking forward to it.<br />P.S.  I've debated with myself if this is worth mentioning (which probably means it is), but Callow sometimes throws in out-of-the-blue references to an individual's homosexuality.  With regards to Houseman, I can understand these allusions, for Callow infers that he was at once Welles' father figure/lover/brother/advisor/friend/enemy (if not in practice, than at least metaphorically).  But there are other such allusions that make little or no sense.  In describing Edna Thomas (a player in Welles so-called &quot;Harlem MacBeth&quot;), Callow refers to the actress as &quot;a discreet and rather statuesque lesbian...&quot;  Marc Blitzstein, author/composer of 'The Cradle Will Rock', is described as having a &quot;sexual orientation [that] was homosexual with occasional heterosexual lapses...&quot;  These are just two examples.  I don't understand the necessity in their inclusion, for they are never referenced again, and have little or no bearing on their relationship to Orson.  Just a curiosity, I guess.	2000-11-05
US	49333751	R17D8ABTJ8FRSQ	0684863472	381316770	A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius : A Memoir Based on a True Story	Books	4	3	5	N	N	An Astounding Work of Death and Embarrassment	I know perfectly well that the title is drenched in sarcastic irony, not to be taken seriously.  But it does provide a neat little model for this review, so here goes (I'll skip the prepositions 'a' and 'of', for lack of anything relevant to say about them):<br />Heartbreaking?  Well, yeah.  Its ability to break your heart is its best feature.  The entire opening chapter, in which Eggers intersperses poetic description of his father's unexpected death with a touching story about his mother's relentless bleeding nose, is actually quite beautiful in its bleakness.   <br />Work?  Well, partially.  At times it feels like a verbatim transcription of his manic tape-recorded ramblings.  Not impressive.  But there are great moments of meta-fiction mixed with juvenile comedy that are startling.  The scenes with Toph capture perfectly the typical brotherly relationship (at least it reminded me of the relationship I have with my little brother: a flurry of inside jokes and insults, hiding a subtext of true affection).<br />Staggering?  Sometimes.  I almost expected the tone he uses.  He's a young man whose feelings are constantly measured against mediated images, which are again measured against mediated images, which are again... Only it never gets tiresome.  The most staggering moments are those in which he breaks from the memoir, to comment on its fictionality (such as when an interview with a 'Real World' producer suddenly implodes in on itself when the author admits that it's a sham, just an excuse for some exposition he couldn't fit anywhere else... you've gotta respect that).<br />Genius?  No such thing, in my humble opinion.  But Eggers knows that well enough himself, so I don't think he's worried.  His greatest strength is giving us his real thoughts.  When trying to stop the bleeding nose, his thoughts focus mainly on the cramp in his arm (which he remedies by lying above her on the couch, the better to see the TV).  When he leaves little brother Toph alone with a babysitter for the first time, his paranoid thoughts focus on the babysitter's potential as a pedophilic rapist.  It's this lack of filtering that allows the book to transcend the expected style of ironic detachment, and contributes greatly towards the pathos.<br />Miscellanea:<br />* It's peopled with many dropped celebrity names.  Look for cameo appearances by Robert Redford, William T. Vollman, Mr. T, Robert Urich, Adam Rich, Vince Vaughan, and Judd and Puck from 'The Real World: San Francisco'.<br />* I've never encountered 'Might Magazine', but I think I might now (pun intended).  I appreciate Eggers' honesty in explaining that while the &quot;anti-establishment&quot; Might staff intended to poke holes in hypocrisy, they were a bunch of trust-fund kids trying to act credible.<br />* FYI Dave, Crispin Glover played 'George McFly', not 'Marty McFly' in 'Back to the Future'.<br />Enjoy.  I did.	2000-10-25

Lit. + faux autobiography	The book feels like it was written by the guys who programmed Deep Blue to beat Gary Kasparov, partnered with a hopelessly romantic English professor frustrated by post-modernism.  That's as good a summation as I can muster.<br />It's not about cognitive neurology and vast computer networks meshing into one literate machine.  It's about one man's search for the loves and lives he's lost.  Richard Powers - the character in the book and possibly the author as well - has lost friends and family and lovers.  He's also lost his passion for literature and his willingness to write fiction.  The ten months he spends with Helen (the title character, so to speak), training her to compete in a master's level comprehensive English exam allows him to remember those moments in his life where things went wrong.  And change them.  Or so he thinks.<br />Helen reminded me of &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;; she's Charlie Gordon (by way of HAL 9000), only we never get to see her private journal, and she's housed inside an enormous computer network.  Powers handles well her gradual introduction to the language.  In the beginning she makes mistakes with syntax, and they always seem quite plausible, as if really coming from a machine learning English from scratch.  Eventually, she makes leaps and bounds, catching both her teacher and the reader off guard.  These are my favourite moments.  I found myself taking a startled step back along with the characters in the book when Helen made her profound and poetic statements.  And just like Charlie Gordon (and HAL), you know that her consciousness must come with a price.<br />Richard Powers - the author and possibly the character as well - has written a fine post-sci-fi melodrama.  The story had me engrossed, even as it tried desperately hard to tug on my heartstrings.  Maybe the drama caught me off-guard, for I was expecting cyberpunk but got a tender tale of lost loves.  Either way, I got sucked in.  In the best possible way.	2000-10-21

That's part of it, yes, but the book is about so much more.  It talks about the nature of fate, apocalyptic fears, the downfalls of academia, as well as two or three dozen other things.  And it does so in a language that fluctuates between pretentious effusiveness and ironic silliness.<br />Hubert and Eddie Coffin (the title characters) are a modern day Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (not the Shakespeare but the Stoppard versions).  Their brand of illogical logic is the only thing maintaining their existence. They are great characters caught up in a fascinating relationship.  Like Ros and Guil, every attempt by one to understand the thoughts of the other comes back empty.  That lasts for a while, and then Hube (a man missing more limbs than he's kept) goes and morphs into Tyler Durden.   Fischer's style had me perplexed for awhile, but I think I've nailed it down.  Think of a movie you know with hip dialogue and at least one torture sequence (my mind skips to 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Fight Club').  Now, imagine that story told to you in the first person by a bookish, lazy, witty, fat, balding, Cambridge-educated philosopher, whose inner dialogues are always terribly funny and exceedingly self-deprecating.  Oh, and he has attention deficit disorder.  I think that describes it pretty accurately.<br />My thoughts re all those Z's: coupled with much 'fin de millennium' talk, Fischer appears to be leading us towards some kind of apocalyptic end.  Not to worry, for we will be reborn on the other side.  Listen to his description of the car wreck that thrusts our narrator towards his bank robbing ways: &quot;...I was ejaculated through the windscreen, reborn from the automotive womb.&quot;  We have our experiences, he appears to be saying, and they change us (for the better?) when we get to the other side.<br />This is a good, quick read, punctuated with big ideas (or at least they seem like big ideas -- if the narrator doesn't take them seriously, should I?), and great comic set pieces.  It somehow manages to build all this up to a very suspenseful ending, which it pulls off with great panache.	2000-10-18
US	49333751	RUD52FWQJJMH5	0786866527	474101056	Experience	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Mart on Kingsley: a touching memoir	Don't bother treading here if the names Christopher Hitchens, Saul Bellow, or -- for goodness sake -- Kingsley Amis don't ring a bell (although one needn't have set foot near 'The Rachel Papers' or 'The Information').  Amis expects some prior knowledge from his reader.  He is after all not just an author, but a tabloid celebrity as well (a fact of his life that he never shies away from).<br />He cheekily proposes at one point that he, Nabokov, and Joyce form their own sub-group in the literary canon, membership limited to those with gymnastic prose styles and horrid dental histories.  It's a great example of Amis' self-deprecating humour as well as his well-deserved self-confidence.  For the first two thirds of the book, Mart tends to fall into his old trap of overusing his skills as a prose stylist, while his 'experiences' get short shrift.  He regularly quotes from his own work, his father's work, as well as quite liberally from Nabokov, Bellow, Phillip Larkin, Joyce, etc.  At times it appears that he's working on a thesis paper concerning the great stylists of twentieth century literature.  But usually the quotes manage to be quite relevant.  After all, he is detailing the relationship between a literary father and a literary son (and a literary community), so why not borrow extensively from their shared passion: literature.<br />The last third of the book is heart breaking and cathartic.  And it actually benefits from that rather cold, clinical beginning.  For a writer so often described as a cold tactician, he handles the emotional moments in his life quite well.  The Delilah Seale revelation, the Lucy Partington murder, and the death of Kingsley are all very movingly (sorry, Mart) handled.  The one constant in these three cases is that they are portrayed through Martin Amis' experience.  And he experiences them through a writer's eye, always referring to literature's teachings on how to handle the ecstasy or the grief.  Thankfully, he is smart enough to not only think his way through these times, but feel his way as well (the sentence detailing his whereabouts at the moment of his father's death is just heartbreaking).  A good show.<br />Much has been said of the plentiful footnotes.  My take is this: he wrote the book, set it aside for awhile, and then read it again with the full intention of free-associating.  The footnotes are just that: tangential comments that are at once interesting anecdotes, and addendums that comment further on the themes of the narrative.  After first finding them distracting (I don't like my reading flow to be so thoroughly interrupted), I welcomed their commentary.<br />A quick side note: in the book's pictures, Martin looks either like a young Mick Jagger, a particularly disheveled Liam Gallagher, or a very somber Spalding Gray.	2000-10-14
US	49333751	R17WE2RUI3SB00	0802135765	937401692	Great Apes (Will Self)	Books	3	17	19	N	N	Not great, just good	I don't think that this book's satire is its strongest suit.  Sure, Mr. Self manages to poke fun at humanity's romantic notions of love, relationship, and affection, by pointing a giant ape-sized mirror up to us.  But that is really just a minor part of the book.  He's really involved in a drawn out discussion of semiotics.  By giving his ape-society an entirely different form of communication (signing), he's able to call attention to the way that we communicate with each other.  Okay, I've said my piece.<br />The descriptions and displays of the ape society are nearly perfect.  The constant grooming, &quot;arse-kissing&quot; (literally; it's a display of respect), physical recriminations, and especially the wall-to-wall copulating (&quot;mating&quot;) are jarring at first, but eventually become routine for the reader.  If there's any satire here, it's in Self trying to elicit a horrified response from his more prudish readers.  I found the rules and regulations of his ape society fascinating and very well drawn.<br />I also enjoyed the fact that he took human cultural items (O.J. Simpson, HIV/AIDS, The Planet of the Apes movies) and hypostatized them, as they would appear in the ape world.  He also had much fun substituting human for chimp/ape and chimp/ape for human whenever he could (&quot;chimpanity&quot;, going &quot;human sh*t&quot;, etc.) <br />My complaints about the novel are thus:<br />The secondary plot, in which several ape underlings conspire to form an alliance against Dr. Busner, felt tacked on.  It never went anywhere, and hardly affected the plot.  The one revelation that it provided had literally no dramatic effect at all.  Pity, because it could have provided a much-needed narrative shake-up, to move the story along.<br />His characters all talk as if they are the offspring of Umberto Eco and Sigmund Freud.  Everyone appears extremely well versed in the teachings of semiotics and clinical psychology. Even Simon (simian?) Dykes, the schizoid human-turned-ape, showed vast amounts of knowledge, so much so that I wondered why he didn't just up and cure himself!  It became mighty frustrating, especially for the layman with only a cursory understanding of each, and a desire to read dialogue that doesn't sound like it's being copied from a textbook.  Maybe that was that point?  If it was, then it wasn't made clearly enough.<br />Self's prose -- the non-clinical portions -- was very inconsistent.  At first, it felt very verbose, as if the author was paid per fifty-cent word.  And at times it felt almost taciturn, preferring to make his points through the grunts that peppered the apes signing.  I preferred the instances of the latter, purely for the fact that they contributed more to setting up his ape society, to the former, which only confused my sweet, little brain.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the novel for the alternate society it portrayed, and was more than a bit annoyed that it never really used it to say anything of interest.	2000-10-08

I wrote a paper in university on the social relevance of funk lyrics (focused on James Brown, George Clinton, and Sly Stone).  When treading through the ethnomusicology section of our library, I was dismayed that there was not one funk treatise to be found.  Thankfully, someone as versed in the funk as Mr. Vincent has taken a great first step down that path.<br />The great thing about the book to me is that Vincent manages to display both an academic's need for historical reason, and a funk-lover's passion for the music.  It kills me every time he spends a page in the academic's voice, delineating the foundations of the music -- such as James Brown's emphasis on rhythm over melody -- only to wrap things up with a down-home phrase like &quot;...fonk that created a breathless, animated, nasty hype-dog feel.&quot;  It's a fine mix of reason and passion, in that one sentence.  And notice the spelling of &quot;fonk&quot;.  He also throws in fonque, fonkey, FUNK, FONK (capitalization is his).  It makes for a great conversational feel (you can just hear the guttural tone in his voice when he calls Stevie Wonder &quot;fonkey&quot;).<br />He does a fine job displaying funk's lineage, although it is understandably ragged and all over the map.  It can get confusing when a discussion of Parliament segues into a discussion of Rick James and Prince, back to James Brown and then onto Funkadelic.  But that's the nature of any music's evolution: it bobs and weaves all over the place, taking notes from soul, jazz, gospel, blues, etc.  Vincent does yeomen's work keeping the line as simple as possible, showing how we got from funk's beginnings to the various incarnations of the funk today (Dr. Dre and Red Hot Chili Peppers to list two examples Vincent positions under the contemporary funk umbrella).<br />I guess my original intention when I bought this book was to expand my funk palette.  Vincent's range of knowledge is so vast, that anyone with the teeniest of funk leanings will learnof something new to pick up, and most likely, JAM to.  The appendix listing his essential funk albums is worth the price of admission in and of itself.	2000-10-02

Here he gets the full treatment, and comes off as another one of those great curmudgeon characters.  Only in the hands of Vonnegut, he becomes much more.  He is crotchety, bitter, cynical, and several steps from senility.  But he still has a wonderful memory for his past, and Vonnegut creates for him a fictional autobiography that's fascinating and endearing.  And a laugh riot.<br />Rabo has one eye.  Rabo was an artist of astounding technical talent, yet helped form the Abstract Expressionist movement (along with his friends the fictional Terry Kitchen and the very real Jackson Pollock).  Rabo has seen the best talents of his generation succumb to suicide and self-destruction, yet he is still kicking and screaming at 71.  Rabo (guided by Vonnegut) is in the process of pouring his life onto the page, with the encouragement of a mysterious woman who has moved into his home.  <br />Vonnegut's greatest accomplishment in the book is the building up of the surprise ending (What the heck is in the barn?) to the point where something astounding should happen, and then drawing up a scene where something astounding happens.  It all lives up to the hype, which is a tough thing to do.  But I never doubted my man Kurt for a second.  He is one of my favourite writers -- for his pointed humour and his deceptively simple prose -- and this is one of his best books.  He has managed to create a commentary on the history of war, art, Europe, America, and literature in the twentieth century, by gently leading the reader through a guided tour of one man's life.	2000-09-30

In this collection of humourous essays, Umberto Eco exemplifies my most favourite literary character: the lovable curmudgeon.  Only he happens to be a curmudgeon blessed with world class wit, an encyclopedic knowledge of history and art and literature, and the reputation as the world's leading expert on semiotics.  I enjoy his writing best when he's not wielding all of those swords at once.  During those pieces the humour gets tangled up in the academia, causing migraine headaches for his less nimble-minded audience (an example of this is the long piece 'Stars and Stripes', which in the interest of full disclosure I'll admit to not understanding).<br />The better pieces are quick, to the point, and almost existential.  They are also very accessible.  'On the Impossibility of Drawing a Map of the Empire on a Scale of 1 to 1' takes that wickedly mischievous proposition to its logical conclusion, and skewers the pomposity of academics who feel equipped to offer a truthful representation of the world.  Eco himself knowingly gets caught in that crossfire, much to his own delight.  My favourite piece is entitled 'How Not to Use the Cellular Phone'.  In it, he rationally categorizes cell phone users (ranging from those so important they need to be on-call 24 hours a day, to those living lives so lame they must constantly be in contact with people who might be doing something interesting).  Upon completion, I felt justified in my desire to never own one of those horrendous little gadgets.<br />Once again, a funny little book that makes you look at the world your living in just a bit differently.

That being said, it is tremendously flawed.<br />First, get these guys an editor.  As Burnett admits near the end, these accounts were all written while on the island, nothing changed with the benefit of hindsight.  Well, maybe a run through the spellchecker might have been in order.  I can't stand seeing spelling errors in a commercial book; it leaves a sour taste in my mouth.<br />Contentwise, Burnett does his best to depict the island experience as transcendental for all involved.  Unfortunately, he slips into scenes of self-parody every once in a while, calling host Jeff Probst &quot;Chief Jeff&quot; ad nauseum being the chief infraction.  He also does his best to portray the various reward/immunity challenges as Zen-like experiences, when they came off on TV as nothing more than summer camp games.  Finally, his handling of the narrative is rather sloppy.  The strength of the show was the pacing and direction (or misdirection) of the story.  Burnett (with Dugard) just can't seem to keep all the threads together on the page as efficiently as he did on the small screen<br />That being said, his enthusiasm for the experience is infectious.  'Survivor' was his 'new toy', and he has lots of fun in the book telling all the dirty little secrets that made up its creation.  There is much psychoanalysis of the contestants, and even though it comes off as pocket book Freud, it is welcome insight into why these particular people were chosen for the show.  In fact, this, coupled with relevant details of the castaways' home and island lives, gives us a fuller picture of these people than the TV show ever did (I was glad for more information about Greg, who the book portrays as a much more interesting and complex person than his screen time showed).  This made the drama of the book - which is inherently compromised when the whole world already knows who the winner was - much stronger.  I got the notion that if the story portrayed in the book were brought to the TV screen (instead of what we'd already seen), then the show would have been a bigger (emotional) hit than it already was.<br />Don't expect great literature here (after all, this is &quot;The Official Companion Book of the CBS Television Show&quot;; not a healthy pedigree at all).  And if you haven't seen most or all of the shows then you probably won't get an emotional investment in these people just from the book.  But if you were excited every Wednesday night this summer for 9:00 to roll around (as I was), then this is a damn good way to relive those memories.	2000-09-21

The man no long was; only the persona remained.  The detailing of this problem -- which ruined Milos Forman's recent Andy Kaufman biopic, i.e. the examination of the man where the public persona is omnipotent -- is the real strength of this book.  Kanfer does a great job showing how Groucho could never escape being Groucho; he was either the funny little man with the greasepaint moustache, cutting people down with his razor sharp wit, or he was nothing.  It's a great psychological portrait.<br />The vaudeville sections are bright and lively, really capturing the anarchic spirit that the brothers held.  Kanfer does a good job showing the transition from vaudeville to movies, including the fears and trepidations of those involved, especially Groucho's.  Even though we know that worldwide fame would eventually come, the road traveled to get there is filled with much tangible drama.<br />Groucho's later years are done particularly well.  They're especially effective when the reader gets an indication of how far Groucho has fallen: a man who once verbally terrorized all the women in his life gets his karmic retribution.  It's quite a sad chapter; I as a reader couldn't wait to read of Groucho's death, just to put the old man out of his misery.  Very powerful.<br />Unfortunately, the book is weak in several other areas.<br />The sections dealing with Julius' childhood needed a deeper biographical sketch of his mother Minnie Marx.  We are told repeatedly of her great will and dominance over the boys, but we only see glimpses of that.  Kanfer does yeomen's work researching the other areas of Groucho's life, so why skimp out on the beginnings?<br />Later, when dealing with the heyday of the Marx Brothers movies, it is apt to re-quote a criticism Groucho himself makes on page 380: &quot;[Critics] do a new kind of writing.  They rent our movies, tape-record them and write down all the good jokes in their books.  Quite a writing feat!&quot;  He's talking about the glut of criticism following the Brothers' renewed popularity in the 1960s, and Kanfer uses the quotation wisely to that extent.  Unfortunately, he himself uses that very same hackneyed technique!  There are transcriptions of scenes from 'Duck Soup' and 'Horse Feathers' that run for pages.  Granted, they are almost as entertaining on paper as they are on screen, but they serve little purpose in a biography.  Kanfer tries to tie the scenes into the narrative of Groucho's life, but he generally fails to do so effectively.<br />When Groucho has his popular rebirth, with the television show 'You Bet Your Life', what should be an important time in contributing to the enduring appeal of the comedian is glossed over.  A period of ten years feels like just two, before we are thrust into Groucho's twilight.  I would have loved more anecdotes and analysis from this era.<br />My suggestion to those interested is that this is a good start to get an understanding of Groucho.  For those already versed in Marx lore, this book will probably infuriate rather than enlighten you.	2000-09-20

This collection deserves to be read in one continuous read.  It refers to  itself backwards and forwards, sideways and down, so it's a real treat (and  quite a convenience) to have the whole tangled mess between two covers.   However, each of the six sections deserves its own sub-review.<br />'The  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' is the name of both the most popular  portable comprehensive galactic encyclopedia, and the book that begins  Douglas Adams hilarious space saga.  It neatly sets up the tale by giving  away the answer to the meaning of life!  Don't panic, it's not all it's  cracked up to be, because they don't have the question!  We meet a great  cast of eccentric characters, get to fly around on the 'Heart of Gold'  (powered by the ludicrously simplistic Improbability Drive), and discover  that planet Earth will be destroyed to make way for an interstellar  roadway.<br />'The Restaurant at the End of the Universe' builds on the logic  of the first book, and tweaks it enough to keep things really interesting.   Milliways (the aforementioned restaurant) is a great comic creation,  walking a grossly absurd existential tightrope to become a fascinating  setpiece.  There's a great moment about how Zaphod Beeblebrox's  great-grandfather is named 'Zaphod the fourth' while he's 'Zaphod the  first' (&quot;An accident involving a contraceptive and a time  machine&quot;).  The whole gang narrowly escapes flying into the sun, and  are saved by a piece of specious bureaucracy.  The whole mess ends with  Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent landing on a familiar planet, and discover  that evolution ain't all it's cracked up to be.<br />The strength of the first  two books is that when Adams goes off on these incredible leaps in logic  and flights of fancy (two of my favourite modes of transportation) they  always seem to follow some kind of narrative thrust.  In 'Life, the  Universe, and Everything', they seem like non-sequiters, or at most just  interesting tangents.  I enjoyed the concept of the poem that was never  written due to a reckless time travel expedition, and the guy who was  injected with too much truth serum and now told The Truth.  But they seemed  more ornamental than consequential to me.  Maybe I just didn't understand  the plethora of cricket references (although I did get a kick out of them).   Furthermore, the installment was hurt by a serious deficiency in Zaphod  Beeblebrox.<br />A grand comeback is made in 'So Long and Thanks for all the  Fish'.  This manages to be a really touching love story, interlaced with  grand questions about the nature of existence and what happened to all the  dolphins.  Arthur Dent and Fenchurch (don't call her Fenny) slowly but  surely realize that the universe has a higher purpose for them, and they  have no choice but to fall in love.  And the scene describing their first  consummation of that love is actually quite original, and very beautiful.   That all being said, the story still manages to be a strong link in the  overall chain of events, periodically keeping track of Ford Prefect until  it becomes necessary for him to swoop in near the end (deux es  machinas-style) and save the cosmic day.  Adams also manages to include  several more comic illogicalities (probably not a word, but whose rules am  I following here?), the standout being the description of Wonko the Sane's  inside-out house.  A great little interlude, that.<br />'Young Zaphod Plays it  Safe' is a confusing little mess, that I hope gains some meaning in  hindsight, once the entire book is complete (**I've just finished reading  'Mostly Harmless', and I'm still in the dark over this one.  Oh  well.)<br />'Mostly Harmless' is a little less frenetic than its predecessors  are, and a little more assured in its narrative structure.  Its story is  one of those that begins with three different plots, and as time goes on  the plots slowly begin to converge into one final conclusion (kind of like  an episode of Seinfeld, nowthat I think about it).  Arthur and Ford get  into some seriously mixed up situations, but they are perfectly explained  through some more of that demented Douglas Adams logic.  Ford actually  jumps to his death, miraculously escapes, and then jumps again.  And he has  a perfectly good reason for doing it both times.  My one complaint is that  the book doesn't give each plot equal attention, so when you haven't read  about one of the characters in a while, you tend to forget what they were  doing when last you met them.  On a positive note, the whole enterprise  actually validates the mess that was 'Life, the Universe, and  Everything'.<br />The series can be read in two ways: as comic fluff (albeit  high comic fluff), or as a satire on the nature of existence.  A third way,  and probably the most effective, would be to read it as both.  Or neither.   Just read it!	2000-09-04

It is a great piece of meta-media, with a sense of humour  so addictive that you'll need to chew a pack of gum just to get on with  your life.<br />I read the online Onion in short spurts, quickly scanning the  headlines and very rarely actually reading whole stories.  The reason for  this, I guess, is that I find the regular paper falls into familiar  patterns in an attempt to satirize the mundane nature of everyday life.   When a story begins &quot;Area man...&quot;, I usually know where the story  is going.  But when they train that sharp eye on the hypocrisy of history,  The Onion staff really shines.<br />The headlines here are strong. 'Al  Capone's Reign of Tax Evading Terror Comes to an End', 'Pentagon Develops  A-Bomb Resistant Desk', 'Holy S--t, Man Walks on F-----g Moon', and 'CNN  Deploys Troops to Iraq' are just a few examples of their Haiku-like  precision in taking aim at their targets.  My favourite has to be from the  September 3, 1939 issue, which proclaims in bombastic 144-pt type: 'WA-',  and then just underneath 'Headline continued on page 2'.<br />The great  strength of the book, though lies in its stories.  They are consistently  crisply written parodies of journalistic integrity, and the public's need  to be pacified, with the added bonus of using hindsight's ability to  reconstruct history.  Witness the opening paragraph in the story of the  sinking of the Titanic: &quot;Officials of the White Star Line have  confirmed the sinking, during her maiden voyage, of the R.M.S. Titanic, the  world's largest symbol of man's mortality and vulnerability.&quot;  Or a  story in the September 6, 1997 issue: &quot;Princess Diana is being  remembered as a 'wealthy, wealthy woman' following her death in a Paris  auto accident last week.&quot;  Every paragraph contains one of those rare  feats: a sentence that makes you think deep thoughts and laugh deep laughs.   My favourite kind of writing.<br />As the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe  once said, &quot;God is in the details&quot;.   Well, the details here are  what makes the parody so great.  Check out the paper's changing mastheads,  from the simple, patriotic icon in the 1910s, to the bombastic  Eagle-infested coats-of-arms in the forties and fifties (complete with  Latin motto &quot;Tu Stultus Es&quot;, which calls attention to the  foolishness of the whole modern enterprise), to the late sixties where the  Eagle is replaced by a (psychedelic?) flying onion logo!  And the company  slogans that accompany the mastheads are great as well, my favourite being  from a 1951 edition: 'Safeguard the Norm/Supporting Paranoia'.  When  flipping casually through the book, just don't forget to pay close  attention to the marginalia.  It's worth it.	2000-09-02

Comparisons to Tom Robbins are always welcome, especially if the  book manages to live up to Tom's majestic standards.  Am I the fool, then,  for believing that that could actually happen?  Who knows?<br />So  Robbins-esque I expected.  Tolkien-esque, I thought I'd be able to live  with.  The problem was that when Ruff attempted the former, he had not the  depth of thought or the sense of humour to pull it off.  And when he tried  the latter, he had not the skill at linking multiple storylines and the  sense of the epic, the grand, and the heroic.  Okay, so the book doesn't  live up to Robbins and Tolkien.  Fair enough.  How do we judge it on its  own?<br />Not favourably, I'd say.  Apparently Ruff wrote this as his senior  thesis.  It shows, and not in a good way.  I'm even more convinced that any  prospective writer should take some time and live life for awhile outside  of the ivory towers of university life, in order to have experiences that  can be turned into human stories.  Ruff's &quot;studentness&quot; is all  over this one.  He makes (sometimes detailed, sometimes casual) reference  to (among others): Tokien's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit; the Bible;  Medieval Mystery Plays; Waiting for Godot; and much much much Shakespeare.   It's all wrapped up in a story that tries hard to be unconventional, but  never strays too far away from a formula seen many times before in many  different quest stories.  I admit, I enjoyed the concept of Mr. Sunshine,  and the post-modern meta-fiction he brought to the tale.  But it just  wasn't executed well.  Ruff had a great idea there, and he messed it up.   Unfulfilled potential is a pet peeve of mine.<br />I think the book would have  been better served if Ruff had focused on one or two narrative threads  instead of five.  I could've done without the Feline/Canine and Sprite  stories (whenever I realized that the next chapter would focus oneither of  those, I would emit an audible groan and receive many confused stares from  the other subway patrons).  I liked S.T. George and his storytelling; I was  intrigued by the Bohemians.  Should have left it at that.<br />Many of the  reviewers here mention that they too went to Cornell U.  Is this a case of  &quot;You had to be there&quot;?  Must I have spent my formative years in  Ithaca to appreciate what this book stands for?  Anyone have an answer for  me?<br />Now, I know that Ruff himself has denounced this work, calling it  immature and a bit too sprawling.  I'll add that the prose sometimes  bordered on the painfully cliché, and suggest that some of the character  psychology included could have been a little less melodramatic.  But there  were some shining moments, however few and far between they may be.  Which  gives me hope when I do try and read his other book.  Because I do see much  potential here.  And like I said, a little bit of living might have done  this writer some good.  So it's for this potential that I give the book  three (instead of just two) stars.	2000-08-11
US	49333751	R38K0184HOLJ7Z	0345336976	318730795	Without Feathers	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Funny thoughts	Like the earlier collection, Getting Even, this is Woody at his existential best.  Short pieces centred around ludicrous concepts are again  the modus operandi.  And even though my complaint still stands that some of  the pieces are a tad silly and filled with too many (comic) non sequiters,  they are still damn funny, and I guess that is all that really  counts.<br />Some of my favourites include &quot;The Whore of Mensa&quot;,  wherein you pay a prostitute fifty dollars and she'll read from her thesis  and then discuss Kierkegaard; &quot;If The Impressionists Had Been  Dentist&quot;, a series of letters from Vincent to Theo Van Gogh regarding  his qualms about which kind of fluoride is the most effective; and  &quot;Slang Origins&quot;, in which Woody details, well, slang origins.   Only they are all totally made up and terribly amusing.<br />I guess the real  highlights of the collection are the twin one-act plays, &quot;Death&quot;  and &quot;God&quot;.  Woody once planned to complete the trilogy with a  play entitled &quot;Sex&quot;; unfortunately he never completed it.  We'll  have to make do with what we have.  And what we have is pretty inventive in  its comedy, if not in narrative.  &quot;Death&quot; focuses on Kleinmann,  an everyman who is pulled from his bed in the middle of the night by a  posse that is tracking down the town's serial murderer.  Only they never  tell him why the need him.  Try not to picture Woody himself as Kleinmann.   It is a tailor made role.  &quot;God&quot; is actually the more ambitious  of the two.  It balances a parody of Greek theatre with the play within a  play within a play concept (Woody actually makes a cameo appearance himself  at once point, albeit only over the phone), to discuss the relationship  between an artist, his work, and his audience (a very post-modern idea).   The climax degenerates into Marx Brothers-style hysteria (and it is only  fitting that Groucho makes an appearance, chasing Blanche DuBois across thestage).  And it too is funny.<br />The whole thing is funny.  These pieces  aren't intended as full-fledged stories.  They are concepts that at one  point flittered in and out of Woody's fertile imagination, and he had the  good sense to put them down on paper.	2000-08-05

I am shocked that this, my favourite book from my teenage years, is consistently out-of-stock!  Quarrington being a Canadian author, I sometimes find the book hidden in the stacks at various Toronto stores.   But that does nothing for the vast American audience who would do well to  read a fictional chronicle of their national pastime.  See this review as  the first step on my personal crusade to revive the life of this great  book.<br />Early in my teens, baseball was my religion.  I memorized  statistics, and read up feverishly on the history of the game.  When given  to me as a gift before the summer of my thirteenth year, I was excited  about beginning Home Game.  It exceeded all of my expectations!  The  baseball scenes were magnificent, but the characters and the story still  managed to overshadow even that.<br />Nathanael &quot;Crybaby&quot; Isbister  is a good focal point.  He was a great baseballer, whose major league  career was curiously brief.  His mysterious past is slowly revealed, and  always provides wonderful revelation about his character.  He is found  wandering in the Michigan countryside, when he happens upon a troupe of  carnival freaks.  They are under constant scrutiny from a religious sect  called the House of Jonah, whose baseball playing is legendary, and whose  leader, Tekel Ambrose, is neck and neck with Isbister for the title of the  greatest ballplayer ever to lace up spikes.  Through a serious of  wonderfully convoluted circumstances, The House of Jonah challenges the  freaks to a baseball game, with the loser to leave town.<br />The carnival  freaks are a beautifully eclectic and wonderfully drawn cast of outcasts.   Dr. Sinister, their leader, speaks in an English so byzantine that no one  can understand him.  Major Mite is the shortest man in the world, and also  the most belligerent.  Angus MacCallister is the strongest man in the  world, with passions run deeper than the Grand Canyon.  There's the Hisslop  sisters, Siamese twinsand second basewomen.  Davey Goliath, the tallest  man in the world, but so full of paranoia that his every move is haunted.   Stella, the fattest woman in the world, and surprise love interest.  And  Zap (a.k.a. the Wild Man From Borneo), who is the focal point of one of the  greatest plot twists I've ever come across.  Each character is given a  detailed personal history so carefully constructed that you really feel  like these people are alive and walking around.<br />The story moves along  with great momentum, constantly being pushed forward by a plot that is  logically structured toward one defining moment.  I especially liked the  framing device he uses (the author's grandfather has returned from exile,  to bully him into writing the story of The Game).  Nothing like a hearty  dose of meta-fiction to brighten your day.<br />The game itself is achieved  with a perfect balance of comedy and drama, suspense and light-heartedness.   After coming to its conclusion, I went back to read it again.  It was only  then that I realized that every at bat is presented... in detail!  This is an  amazing achievement when you realize that Quarrington never repeats  himself.  Each at bat is interesting in itself.  <br />I've re-read this book  several times over the years.  It is still a comic tour de force, and  emotional treasure.  And even though it can never recapture the excitement  of that very first read, I still marvel at this wonderful, little story.	2000-07-30
US	49333751	R3OYAJRBDWB94Q	0440576474	793284806	Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting; A step-by-step guide from concept to finished script	Books	4	14	16	N	N	Out of its time, yet still relevant	One of the problems I had with this book is that Field's prose is incredibly mundane.  The question I kept asking myself was &quot;Why am I taking writing advice from someone who's such a boring writer  himself?&quot;  It led to the old axiom:  &quot;Those who can, do; those  who can't, teach.&quot;  I pegged Mr. Field as one who couldn't, so he's  teaching.  Another problem was that the book was ludicrously out of date.   Two examples of this: 1) his reliance on 'Chinatown' as an example of good  screenwriting; it definitely is, but it is also a couple of decades old; 2)  the chapter on writing with a computer was unintentionally hilarious; it  may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but just like the tacky  clothes we all wore in eras gone by, it's best not to look back on  it.<br />But I realized that it wasn't about the style of the prose, or  whether Field's own screenwriting was any good, or whether the specifics of  his examples were still relevant.  He was able to simplify the basic tenets  of the screenplay, and give practical and easy-to-follow exercises for  overcoming any obstacles.  His paradigm of the three-act story structure  (which he must have diagrammed at least a million times!) is simple, and  yet effective.  After first seeing it visually portrayed, many of the  pieces of the story that'd been floating around in my own head fell into  place.  He also gives helpful hints on how to develop character, how to  construct scenes and sequences, and how to begin the story itself (you  begin by starting with the end!).  Maybe his ideas seem obvious to others,  but they are a real help to me.<br />So my rating is not based on the style of  the book.  It's based on the effectiveness of the teaching.  And this book  does well in that regard.	2000-07-22

To say a biographical event is part of the &quot;Full  Metal Jacket&quot; years actually denotes a grand period in the director's  life.  For Woody Allen, a man who has directed a film a year for the last  thirty-four years, this technique becomes jumbled easily (some chapters  need to be grouped by two or three films, which may not otherwise be  connected except that the same funny little man wrote and directed them).   And Baxter still manages to confuse the reader regarding chronology of  events, even though he has such small periods of time to work with.<br />That  being said, he does a fine job explicating the 'Woody' persona (read  &quot;mensch&quot;) with Woody the man (read &quot;anti-social, calculating  genius&quot;).  He never panders to paperback Freud wisdom, just giving  cold hard truths about the man.<br />I tended to enjoy the chapters dealing  with the films I most enjoyed (late '70's), and felt a constant sense of  doom when dealing with the troubled nineties.  Surprisingly, Woody doesn't  come off as the villain here.  That honour goes to Mia, who is portrayed as  a manipulative, scheming, materialistic waif-whore.  Woody's foibles are  justifiably explained, and maybe rightly so.  I mean, he's been warning us  about his own foibles for years (for a good precursor to the whole Soon-Yin  debacle, see Ike and Tracy's relationship in 'Manhattan').  And I think  that that's the strength of Baxter's book: he at once is able to separate  Woody's art and life, while showing how they are intrinsically related.	2000-07-19

His short pieces were caustic and bleak, black as  night but as funny as death.  They had me alarmed, intrigued, and in fits  of hilarious tears.  And then he died.<br />&quot;So who was Michael  O'Donoghue,&quot; I asked myself.  It was not till several years later,  when I found his devilish visage staring at me from the cover of this book  (brandishing a butcher's knife, no less).  I wanted to learn about Mr. Mike  quite badly, so I bought the book.  I'll make a strange comparison here.   Please hear me out.  The &quot;character&quot; of Michael O'Donoghue that  emerges from Perrin's biography reminds me a lot of the  &quot;character&quot; of John Bonham who emerges from the Led Zeppelin bio  'Hammer of the Gods'.  Both are brilliant artistic geniuses (once again  excuse the hyperbole... justified as it may be) who, at the drop of a hat,  turn into beasts akin to the Incredible Hulk in a particularly foul mood.   It says something about the need for extremity in the artistic mind.   O'Donoghue is the little, balding, bespectacled shnook, who, if tangled  with, will uncoil his cobra-like wit and gnash your eyes out.  He is quite  an intriguing character.<br />Perrin does a fine job recounting the history of  this character, from birth to death.  He also does well to include  transcriptions (and sometimes reprints) of some of O'Donoghue's more  seminal works.  His work for the Evergreen Review is here, best represented  by 'Phoebe Zeit-Geist', which I don't entirely enjoy but can still marvel  at its audacity and prodigiousness.  It's like something R. Crumb would do  after being severely tortured by a group of radical feminists.  His  National Lampoon days helped launch that magazine, as did his days at  Saturday Night Live.  Throughout he is morbid, meticulous, and menacing,  never letting good taste get in the way of a great comic moment.  He leaves  no sacred cow unslaughtered.  I admire that.<br />O'Donoghue is a good  indication of the heights that the bipolar artistic mind can fly to.   Perrin does well capturing that quality.	2000-07-18

And before you start screaming at your  computer screen, I know that the main character is David himself, and it's  not really a novel, but a collection of humour essays.  I see him as a  character, because I just can't believe that all of these fantastic stories  are true.  Is there some truth there?  I'm sure.  But embellishment seems  obvious.<br />Anyway, back to my first thought.  The David in the book is an  intellectual snob, verbose and thoughtful, unsure of himself in most ways  except his sexuality, but extremely sure that he knows what's best for the  world and all its inhabitants.  And he's damn funny, too.  I can relate to  most of that (I'll let you choose what I mean), so getting inside the head  of such a witty and conflicted man was a real treat.<br />The first fifteen  'stories' in the book are well put together pieces on modern life as David  sees it.  The best of that lot includes &quot;A Plague of Tics&quot; in  which David is attacked by a hyperactive form of O.C.D., and  &quot;C.O.G.&quot;, a wonderful riff on the whole Kerouacian lifestyle gone  completely wrong.  These first fifteen pieces, however, only form a prelude  to some of the best writing I've read in years.<br />The second last piece,  &quot;Ashes&quot;, about David's mother's battle with cancer is what good  writing should be: humourous and poignant, without ever being melodramatic.   He wrings literature from real life, and makes the most of a heartbreaking  situation.  I can imagine what kind of catharsis it must have been for  him.<br />The last piece (I want to call it the title track),  &quot;Naked&quot;, is about a trip to a nudist colony.  I found myself  busting a gut in the middle of a crowded subway car.  It is sparkling  comedy.	2000-07-08

The morbid absurdity of these short stories (along with the unfinished &quot;Dead Souls&quot;) marks him as a talented writer.<br />Gogol seems to be able to  milk character from mundane situations, but at the same token craft words  that have as much to do with Garcia Marquez' magic realism than traditional  Russian literature.  It is this aspect that at first caught me off guard,  but in the end made me fall in love with Gogol's prose.<br />My two favourites  are these:<br />&quot;The Overcoat&quot;, the story of a poor, downtrodden man  who saves and saves to buy a fancy new overcoat, but has the whole plan  blow up in his face.  It is tragedy, but often humourous; sad, but  joyous.<br />&quot;The Nose&quot;, which is one of my all time favourite short  stories.  Gogol manages to turn the story of one man's search for his lost  nose (where does he find it?  In a cathedral, of course!) into a scathing  indictment of Russian caste system.  It is wonderfully written and  wonderfully absurd, and in the end you just go along with the context Gogol  has created, because you trust that this is a writer who knows what he is  doing.	2000-06-28

He manages to find a unique voice, and with this voice he beats his own obsessions to a pulp, until they stand up and  say 'Uncle'.<br />Woody gets even with literary biographies, crime, philosophy  (and philosophy and more philosophy), death, religion, intellectualism,  political revolutions, psychology, and of course, mimes.<br />My favourite  piece is the last one:  'Mr. Big'.  It's a brilliant Raymond Chandler  parody, where the blonde bombshell who comes into the private eye's life is  not looking for a missing husband, but proof of the existence of God!   Ingenious!  There's one passage where the detective deduces that since  Socrates killed himself, Jesus was murdered, and Neitzche went crazy, then  there is someone out there and He doesn't want to be found.<br />Woody tends  to fall back on absurdity for his humour a tad too often (at one point,  someone's forehead falls off), and if the collection was any longer it  would have gotten tedious.  But it's just long enough.  Bite sized and  tasty.	2000-06-27

Tom Robbins' books fall into three categories for me:<br />I.  Pure genius (incl. Roadside, Cowgirls, and Jitterbug)<br />II. Respectable flights of fancy (Skinny Legs)<br />III.  Lukewarm efforts (Still Life, Frog  Pajamas)<br />That's not to say that all in (I) are five-star champions and  all in (III) are horrible one-star waste of times.  I've never come across  a viable reason to give anything Tom's written less than four-stars (on the  Amazon.com scale).  Fierce Invalids is no exception.  It is a third-tier  Robbins book, but that makes it better than 99% of the drek out  there.<br />It's unique (not &quot;most unique&quot;) in the Robbins' oeuvre  for one simple reason: a male protagonist.  Switters is the literary  equivalent of a bipolar disorder: he hates organizations, yet is a member  of both the CIA and a convent; he believes in laughter as the road to  Nirvana, yet he carries a Beretta with him wherever he goes; he's  world-wise and pragmatic, yet spends the last two third of the story  confined to a wheelchair due to a shaman's curse.  This theme of binary  opposition runs rampant through the book, and it gives the reader something  tangible to hang on to, something Robbins usually is hesitant to  do.<br />Midway through the narrative, I realized that all that I enjoyed  about the first half of the book has been destroyed, and I was wondering  how Tom would pull it all together in the end (he always does).  He does --  although slightly more melodramatic than usual, I was satisfied with the  knots he made to tie up the loose ends.<br />As for his most unique (couldn't  help myself here, Tom) ability to wield the swords of simile and metaphor,  it has never been sharper.  My favourite:  &quot;Looking at it from another  angle, their kiss was like a paper airplane landing on the moon.&quot;   It's like haiku, that line.<br />For the Tom-completist (of which I am a  recent member), pick it up and bask in its glory, cause you may not hear a  peep from theold man for another five years.  For the Tom-newbie, go back  to Roadside, and save this one for another day.	2000-06-24

William Goldman has said that he told these stories to his daughters, and was then inclined to collect them in one longer prose work.  Only he couldn't get turned on by the parts in between the exciting action.  The  'boring' parts, as it were.  So what does he do?  He eliminates the  'boring' parts altogether, by assembling a fictional 'best parts' version  of someone else's tale!  What a great idea.  Sometimes I reveled in the  fact that I didn't have to slog through seventy pages of Morgenstern's  views on the socio-political history of Guilder and Florin, or how best to  plan a royal wedding.  It actually made the 'best' parts that much  better.<br />I love Goldman's authorial voice.  His pieces for Premiere  magazine on the state of the movie industry have always struck me as very  wise, common sensical, and conversational.  That same voice is utilized to  great effect here.  The characters you loved in the move have been fleshed  out even more, and even though it sometimes proved a distraction when a  scene differed from its twin in the movie, sometimes the change (I know,  the book was written first) was for the better.<br />A caution, though  (**spoilers**): my two favourite moments from the movie (Man in black  suggests Fezzick &quot;dream of large women&quot; and Westley offering the  Dread Pirate Roberts persona to Inigo) aren't here.  I guess you can't have  all your best ideas at once.<br />Still, a truly engaging work, and a near  perfect piece of storytelling.	2000-06-22

That wouldn't stop you from loving  it as much as I did.  You can't help but fall in love with little Owen and  his friend/narrator/biographer John.  The story stucks you in, then sucks  you dry, then spits you back out again, changed forever to relfect all the  things it wants you to be.  Changed to view the world a little differently,  and to be a little more soulful.<br />And of course, how can you not love a  book in which the narrator escapes to your hometown.  Escapes from the past  which he can forget, but which his memory can't.	2000-06-21

Not the man himself, for I am aware that he is fictional. I am in love with the quality of the character. Dostoevsky has created a truly unique, interesting, fascinating, complex, morbid, rational, intelligent, idiotic, and esoteric character, that ranks up there with the best in all of literature. Even though his situation is on the edges of the extreme, he fully inhabits all those qualities that exist in man himself.<br />Raskolnikov's hypothesis is an example of delicious specious reasoning: \\"If I am a brilliant man, then I am special and above the laws of societal morals and ethics, and therefore I shall have the right to kill without repercussions\\". And of course it is doomed to fail (I'm not giving anything away -- the book is after all called \\"Crime and *Punishment*\\"). And the way he fails is the most miraculous part. He can't live up to his own inner expectations, which only proves that he is not a brilliant/special man. Awesome!<br />This book is so high on another level of writing (that combined with the grave disappointment I felt after reading his 'The Idiot') that I am scared to try my hand at other Dostoevsky novels. I mean, how could a man who has achieved this kind of perfection once ever hope to come close again? Probably not a logical summary, but who said human logic was infallible? Not Raskolnikov, I'll tell you that much.	2000-06-20

To those of you who've tried to digest Robbins and failed, I offer gentle encouragement:  keep trying.  Most of the people I know who are now avid Robbins readers began that life baffled and confused by his prose.  I  include myself in that group.  But after trying and giving up and trying  and giving up several times, all of the sudden something clicks and you  realize that he is a literary samurai.<br />I enjoy Robbins because he is able  to fulfill my two main criteria for an awesome book:  skilled witty prose,  and propulsive storytelling.  His epic powers of similie and metaphor  neatly take care of the first, and his stories -- which cannot and should  not be summarized -- are mind bogglingly freaked-out and yet perfect in  their own inherent logic.  Another Roadside Attraction is his first, so he  may be a bit more verbose than usual, but damn if I'd take Tom being too  wordy and juvenile over any other author at his/her peak.	2000-06-19

A professor of mine once said that she wasn't going to take the easy route and describe this book as a cross between Raymond Chandler and Albert Camus. Well, in not doing so, she did so anyway. The comparison stuck. And it works too. Imagine a detective story where you never find out who the killer is, and it doesn't matter! It's so good.<br />Auster packs his books with weighty ideas, while leaving the prose dry and sparse. I think it works. Let the reader breathe a bit, and maybe they'll wrap their head around the story tight enough to get hooked in. It is at this point, of course that Auster reveals that there really is no story, and you've just contemplated the true meaning of human existence. Okay, not really. But at least he's got you thinking.	2000-06-19

Unfortunately, sometimes I can't follow him along  those barely-trodden paths because the technique stomps all over his  humour.  That doesn't happen here.<br />He packs in big ideas and a flurry of  big words (my favourite: uxorious) around a story of a writer's jealousy  for his best friends success.  The eternal debate over the merits of art  and commerce are perfectly symbolized in the antagonistic friendship  between Richard Tull (whose hyper-complex novels induce migraine headaches  in all who dare read its pages) and Gwyn Barry (who shares the same rung in  the literary canon with 'Dave' Barry).  Don't worry friends, there's no  easy answer here.  You get to hate both men!  And it's funny, too!<br />Also,  check out the cool 'Simpsons' reference.	2000-06-19

All favourites of mine.  The conclusion, then, would be to simply add Murakami's name to this  illustrious list.  Well, not so fast, pardner.<br />While I enjoyed the  beginnings of this existential detective story (my own addendum to the  above list would be Paul Auster, whom I also adore), the characters turned  out to be too vague and uninteresting, and the story too breezy to sustain  my interest.  I found my eyes glazing over for pages at a time, because  nothing interesting was happening.  In the interest of fairness, I should  note that many of my misgivings about the story might be the fault of the  translation.<br />I will give Murakami another chance, though,  because I do  see much potential for him and I to be close literary friends.  Anyone who  can draw comparisions like those listed above can't be all bad, can they?	2000-06-18
