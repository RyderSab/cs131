It's not wordy or theoretical, just gives alot of cute examples.  I really enjoy it because it helped to spice up our interactive writing with some creative ideas.  The cover says it is for K-2, but I would say K-1 would be more appropriate.  My first graders are enjoying the ideas I've used!	2004-10-16

I have purchased many books on \\"centers\\", and still was not successful with small group time.  Most literacy center books provide cute reproducibles to produce fun ideas, but all the ideas in the world is not enough to make centers work.  THIS book does!  First of all, it provides practical, realistic ways to understand your expectations for literacy centers, and great ways to introduce them to the students.  The supplies for these centers are not time consuming for the teacher to make, the work stations will be in line with the curriculum.  Her strategies for preventing and managing center behaviors are great!  She outlines some fantastic mini-lessons to both learn and enhance the literacy centers.  Reproducibles are included to go along with some of the centers, as well.  One important feature is that each work station has more than task in it to help keep the students interested.  The centers are fun for the children, and they are reading and/or writing in them!  I highly recommend this book to K-2 teachers, it has helped me very much in my 1st grade classroom!	2003-09-21

If you're like me, and your reading series does not address spelling appropriately (or at all), then you'll find this book very useful.  The spelling words are very appropriate for first grade.  (There's also editions for the other grades.)  For example the first spelling unit is the words: a, an, and, am, and at.  My class is doing very well with this program, and it's easy for me, too.  Everything is provided in reproducibles.	2003-09-21

First of all, WOW, this book is HUGE!  There are over 500 pages of fitness advice, photos, and motivation.  It begins with a breakdown of equipment, including safety equipment.  One thing I enjoy is it also goes into the physiology of how the body works and how it is affected by what we do with it.  It has chapters for beginning strength routines, and also intermediate and advanced, so you can grow with this book, which is really nice.  There are also separate chapters for each of the specific muscle groups.  Name it, it's in here.  Cardio, nutrition....even information on fitness careers and taking it to the competitive level.  The nutrition section goes into vitamins and other nutrients as well as womens' health issues.  I really enjoyed the chapters &quot;Staying Motivated&quot; and &quot;Getting in Shape Doesn't Have to be Boring&quot;, because let's face it, losing motivation can be a killer to keeping up a fitness regimine.  Throughout the book are photos of the beautiful fitness pros you see in Oxygen Magazine, I find these ladies to be very motivating to look at.  I highly recommend this book, especially if you like Oxygen Magazine.  The authors show both knowledge and sensibility, and it is very motivating and well balanced.	2003-08-19

This book will make a great gift for any cat lover, whether Pagan or not.  The book is filled with fun folklore and history about cats.  There are legends and beliefs from all over the world!  These include cats roles in spirituality, superstitions, gypsies, dreams, symbols, and even a little section on the astrology of your cat.  There is also brief information on cat care.  The layout of the book is GORGEOUS with photographs or illustrations on every page.  The book is made of high quality paper as well!  This book is as gorgeous as it is informative and entertaining and I give it an enthusiastic 5 stars!  A must have for cat mommies!	2003-03-09

It's so wonderful for the Earth religions to have a crafty entertainment manual of our own!  There is terrific information on each of the 8 Sabbats, with recipes, crafts, games and more.  The recipes are all vegetarian but could be adapted if one wanted to use meat.  The crafts will make beautiful centerpieces, and the awesome cross stitch patterns for each of the Sabbats could be used separately to make something for each Sabbat or together to make a &quot;Wheel of the Year&quot; sampler.  I am using them separately to have a towel for each Sabbat.  The projects are described beautifully and with lore to make them even more meaningful.  The author's tone is also as lovely as the projects inside.  I recommend this book highly!	2003-02-17

The book begins with some Faery history and folklore, including Shakespeare's faeries and faeries in other literature.  It also breaks down the types of faeries, briefly, leaving room in the book for plenty of Faery magick.  Each chapter begins with a &quot;journey&quot;, which can be read as a beautiful story or meditation relating to the subject matter of the chapter.  Magickal guidelines for working with Fae are described, including gardening and offerings.  The rituals are positive and beautiful, incorporating nature such as flowers, fruits or other treats.  There are special sections devoted to hearth and home magick, love and romance, healing, prosperity, and empowerment.  Sometimes you even get to cook   and eat or create a beauty treatment.  The magick is positive and non-manipulative.  This book is a great addition to the library of anyone desiring to or already working with Faery energy.	2002-12-11

The directions are very easy to follow and include little purses using a variety of stitches:  peyote, square, brick, and netting.  They suggest colors but the user can really use whichever colors they like with the patterns.  I do wish more of the patterns had the little flap closings for the purses, since most are designed to be open on top, but I think the author's reason may have been to keep it simple for beginners.  I'd also like to ad that the book is in full color with nice glossy paper and photos.  I appreciate this since some of the other books I have seen are very low quality with a steep price.  If you're new to beaded amulet purses or other small purses I think you will find this book useful....I have!	2002-10-20

This book includes 12 fun science poems as well as ideas for activities to accompany each poem.  They also recommend related literature.  The ideas are really cute and my first graders are enjoying them.  There are also reproducible patterns for making pictures to go in the chart with the poems.  The science topics included are:  animal homes, animal babies, hibernation, teeth, physical changes, seeds and plants, trees and leaves, sun, stars, rain, snow and colors.  Due to the rhymes, my first graders can read and manipulate the chart independently in centers once it has been taught, and they have fun &quot;teaching&quot; it to eachother.  If you're looking for some pocket chart ideas, you will probably enjoy using this book.	2002-10-12

It is equally valued by my gifted and also struggling students.  The children use it in a story writing center to help when they need to spell a word, or get ideas.  This book is arranged by themes rather than alphabetically, for example, there is a 2 page spread of food words.  This helps the students who are not ready to look up words alphabetically.  The pictures are bright and clear.  The book is sturdy enough to survive being handled daily by several students.  Easily 5 stars!!	2002-10-12

These Daily Language Practice sheets give 1st graders a daily dose of basic editing (adding capitals, basic spelling errors, punctuation).  They also include a variety of other activities including sorting words, yes/no questions, rhyming words, and other fundamentals.  The Friday sheet always has a different and more lighthearted activity.  There is also a Daily Math Practice book and I xerox them back to back and use them as bellwork.  Both are half-sheets which are completed in about 10 minutes.  Highly recommended!	2002-10-12

This book provides a perfect way to give yourself a nice morning ritual or meditation.  It provides a daily poem or song on a variety of female dieties, along with a short reflection on how it is applied to daily life.  I like that Monaghan includes Goddesses from a variety of cultures from all over the world.  Her love of the feminine spirit definitely shines through.  Another special feature is that you can use the index in a variety of ways.  It has listings sorted by diety, or by subject matter, also by country, that way, you can find what you need when you have a specific purpose in mind.  Highly recommended.	2002-10-07

We play it in a \\"family fued\\" type format with table groups competing.  They have a blast and the material in the questions is very compatible with our curriculum and state standards.  It makes a great game for rewarding them when we've finished everything, a good 10 minute filler, and a good activity to suggest to a substitute.  They always get excited when we are going to play, and are requesting it often.	2002-09-21

The heroine is a strong and believable character. She has had to grow strong due to living with an inattentive, alcoholic father and no mother. She is ackwardly taller than the other students in school. Her life takes another tragic turn which leads her on a great adventure away from home, where she must live and act as an adult. I think teen-aged readers, both girls and boys, can identify with Lucy on many levels. What teenager doesn't have family issues and/or some feeling of physical ackwardness? The character inspires by being strong, yet vulnerable. It is also refreshing to read about a teenage girl with more interesting thoughts than worries about boys and clothes. This is an adventurous yet \\"real\\" story that both teens and adults can enjoy! I can't wait to see more books by Sherri L. Smith.	2002-09-15

If you're just getting started in beading, and have been browsing stores, feeling overwhelmed not knowing what you need to get started, or how to get started, you definitely can use this book!  The Companion covers an introduction to EVERYTHING from types of beads and the differences between their finishes, sizing, threads and other equipment, both looming and off loom stitching, stringing, even working with embroidery, wire....and some blank graphs to plan projects drawn according to the stitch (Peyote, brick, square, etc).  The book teaches the basic stitches close up and step by step, and each one I have tried has worked out!  It comes in a cute size also, and spiral bound so it won't slam shut on you when you're stitching.  Keep in mind it does not have any patterns for any projects, but gets you the skills to be able to work with project books, and to go to the bead store and know what to ask for.	2002-08-22

I picked this story up in the Spring to read to my first grade class around Earth Day.  First I read it to them with the illustrations, and then we read it a second time, with the children closing their eyes and visualizing.  They loved this and produced the most amazing drawings, with writing of how they'd dance upon the Earth.  I recommend this book highly to parents or teachers for a variety of reasons:  It is beautiful, it inspires imagination, and it reflects love for the Earth.	2002-08-19

It's actually the first book George ever appeared in.  I think it can be enjoyed simply for that, keeping in mind it was written in simpler times before childrens' books were analyzed for political correctness.  A previous review slashed this book saying the monkeys were cruel to the giraffe....I've never seen it that way, nor have the kids who I've read it to.  See for yourself.  If you're a fan of Curious George you'll enjoy seeing his debut.	2002-08-19

I actually don't consider it to be sexist, because yes it acknowledges differences between men and women, but we are different, if we weren't, what would be the attraction?  In her 20th anniversary edition she addresses the issue as well.  I enjoy this book thoroughly every time I read it.  Any time you're just looking for some peace, its nice to have it around.  Also the rituals don't require a run to the store for the right color candle or herb, they are simple in supplies, and rely on the poetic words and feelings instead.  It's a must-read for women of the Goddess in my humble opinion.	2002-08-10

I find it to not only be nice to look at, but an excellent visual for working with Fae in meditation or magick. The books I have used to far that explain how to work with the Fae don't provide the visual support, so its the perfect companion with, for example, Edain Mc Coy's guide to working with Faery Folk.

The advice presented in this book is a good place to start for a guide to working with the Fae.  The dictionary addresses many types of Faeries but I feel it would have helped to have illustrations to accompany the definitions, even simple black and white sketches would have helped, to provide the mind with visual memory cues when working in meditation.  My advice as a remedy to this is to use one of Brian Froud's books to provide the visual side of it, along with the good information in this book.  Don't get me wrong, the info and ideas are very useful, and I do recommend it to those looking into working with Faeries.  The advice is sensible and she writes wonderfully.	2002-08-06
