Did you ever have a book so good that you read it slowly because you didn't want it to be over, even though you were dying to know how it turned out?  This is one of them...all of his novels are good, but this one is first rate....likeable and plausible characters and a gripping plot.  Some of it may be a tad improbable, like Sally's action in the mine, but HEY, suspension of disbelief is necessary some time.  6 stars if that were possible,	2005-09-26

Move over, Robin Cook....this is a thrilling page turner from a doctor who knows what he's writing about.  I loved the operating room segments.  The suspense keeps building...some of the risks that Tyler took seem maybe a tad implausable in real life but HEY! made a really hard to put down story.  Hope to see more from this talented author.	2005-08-26

Some of the plot was a little unbelievable,,hard to believe that the police would share so much information with a civilian, and even harder to believe that they would use a 6 month pregant woman with a wire to confront a possible suspect!!  But sort of just suspend disbelief and go along for the ride.   Await her next one eagerly.	2005-08-18
US	48429137	R3D92YQADI9SH5	084991180X	723070327	Monster	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Good read	Thought this was going to be a good suspense story and was sort of horrified to discover that it was \\"Christian fiction\\" in the jacket blurb...but it was actually an interesting and gripping story...the characters were not, other than the main ones, well delineated.  But the relationship between Beck and the mutations was touching and well described.  And, the so called \\"Creationist\\" theory wasn't harped upon. But doubt if I will read another from this author.	2005-08-17

As a very math-averse person whose eyes glazed over when it got to the bit about integers and prime numbers,,,well, I just skimmed over those parts to get back to the story.  An unusual premise...are there really people who can count cards, etc. in a blackjack game??  Interesting and surprising.  Nina doesn't seem as strong as she did in some of the earlier books.  And Bob is really growing up.  Not one of their best, but well worth a read.	2005-08-12

Protagonist Walter not well developed and frankly by half-way thru the book I really didn't care what happened to him.  At least in the last chapter the author sort of tied together the plot.  And, is it really likely that a middle-aged Egyptologist, an ivory tower type, would just keep on going after his awful face injury, spit lip, broken glasses, blood-soaked clothes..???? Any normal person would go to the hospital and then the optometrist.  And where in the story does Zenobia belong???  Don't buy it; if you want to read it check it out at the library.	2005-08-08

Bedtime story for a lesbian feminist...gay marriage, ordination of women, optional priestly celibacy!!! Never gonna happen in my lifetime.  Oh, forgot to mention women's right to choose: Berry made a good point that       I had never  thought of that Mary could have refused!!  The premise is unlikely, but a great page turner; hard to put down.  Read it.	2005-07-31

Oh, and Martie, the line \\"It just shows to go you\\" is a gag line from either an old radio or early TV show...you must be too young to know it.  And also the double \\"with\\" usage.  Take it from an old geezer!	2005-07-28

This is a good stand-alone read if you can get past the improbability of an attorney risking her career the way she does.  If you can get  past  that, then just relax and enjoy. Reheema is a well-developed character; the friendship that develops is a tad improbable to me.  But, as I said, a good read on a Summer's day.	2005-06-25

Racially preduciced...yes.  But, remember the context; just after WW II.

Funny, quirky, really hard to categorize,,,so different,  I loved it: srory of a young woman in Hong Kong before the takeover by China who talks to the ghost of her great, great, great grandmother and has innocently got caught up in the machinations of a Triad leader.  She tries to lie and bluff her  way out of problems, and every time she does it seems to re-inforce the fact that she can really see the future.  Hysterically funny but also touching...contrast between grinding poverty and \\"wretched excess\\",,,and the characters are so well depicted.	2005-05-03

If you are expecting a good British police proceedural novel, this is not it.  I doubt if I will read either the prequal or sequal.  Very wordy and introspective.	2005-04-30

Tied all the stories of these disfunctional families together, and you end up rooting for Jackson, Theo, Amelia (not Jullia, that slut!) and Caroline.  Atkinson is not Ruth Rendell (WHEN will we get another from her??!!)  but this is a GREAT read.	2005-04-16

I love Ramses twins (now he knows what Amelia put up with him as a precocious brilliant child) and the Great Cat of Re!!.  Not particularly fond of the stupid new dog.

So, was devastated at the ending (will not give it away in case you haven.t read it).  Does this mean Ms. George is dropping the series?

Plot interesting and mostly good characters (I love Aunt Nori), Andrea changed from nasty and unappealling to pleasant and needy.  BUT...was that unpleasant bondage sex scene with Hugh at all necessary to advance the story??  That dropped it down from 5 to 4 stars for me.  I hope Rei thinks again about marrying a man who would do such a thing!  As a lifelong Washington resident I enjoyed the local color.  Not one of her best.	2005-01-13

The Boston was VERY boring to a non-sports-fan...all that description of a basketball game...tedious!!  But I liked Dorothy..maybe they can each expand on these  and further develop the characters.

Also, did anyone else wonder how the hero, who was described earlier as being financially strapped (on leave, had to get a $5,000 advance on his Visa, owes alimony to his ex) managed to fly all over the country, rent cars right and left, stay at hotels and motels, etc???  Just not plausible. Also, I never try to guess what is coming next (like to just go along for the read) but two of the conjurers tricks were so obvious I spotted them at once: woman sawn in half and Indian rope trick.  Not up to his usual standard.	2004-12-12

Teriffic story: well dilineated, likeable characters; clever interweaving plots; hard to put down.

Maybe it's just me, but the character wasn't particularly appealing and the narrative not really gripping.

I was very wary when I  got this when I realized it was NOT part of the teriffic Lincoln Rhyme series,,, am uneasy when an author leaves a great subject to branch out in a new direction:  does anyone remember how utterly AWFUL Patricia Cornwell's Isle of Dogs was when she dropped Kay Scarpetta?

Second half...well, mostly boring; just kept reading to see how it would turn out.  znone of the characters were especially well developed or appealing.  And, had to skip over the sex parts. I like Nora Roberts; this the first I have read by her alter ego and doubt if I will read any more.	2004-06-13

TERIFI C read..starts out very slow and just when you wonder if it is worthwhile to keep on reading it really takes off and grabs you.  Why have I never heard of this author before?

This was every bit as god as Hominids; I can hardlt wait till Hybrids comes out in paperback.  I like the Neandertals system of sex separation and responsible breeding, and their acceptance of gay relations.  And especially the way they do not overpopulate and respect the Earth.  But the sex scenes were a bit graphic and not really necessary to advance the story; which is why I only gave it 4 stars.	2004-02-29

One reviewer referrred to them as &quot;stale&quot; ???  Not to me; I want more.  I'm glad I checked this out at the library instead of wasting my money.

I love her Monk and Pitt novels and was looking forward to this one.  If this had been by &quot;Jane Doe&quot; I might have given it 4 stars, but  I was really disappointed.  When an aothor abandons a teriffic series (i.e., when Patricia Cornwell dropped Kay Scapetta and wrote that HORRIBLE &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; ) readers don't get what they were expecting.  Sorry, Anne, go back to the Victorian age.	2003-10-02

Read Womens Country and almost thru with this one; I LOVE it.  She really puts masculine arrogance and the patriarchy where they really are.  The time frame is wrong; it is already past the time depicted (2000) but the signs are fitting our times: i.e. the American Taliban, Ashcroft, the attacks on Wade v. Rowe.....scary!!! She is s prophet.  I am 73, and wish there had been an author like this when I was younger.  The characters are well written and you care about them.	2003-08-26
