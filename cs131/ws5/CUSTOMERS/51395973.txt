Ms. Thompson tries to write in a friendly, gossipy style, leading her to be flippant about some fairly serious world and personal events.  She frequently lambasts other biographers of the Mitfords for reading too much into Nancy's books: but then on the same page she talk about all the subtext in her novels that MUST be true because otherwise she wouldn't have written about it. <br /> <br />Most annoyingly, she believes everything Nancy says.  Now, I've read a fair amount of books about the Mitford sisters, and though it's never really said straight out, it seems fairly obvious to me that Nancy was something of a drama queen who exagerated, invented, and stretched truths about herself and her past.  And no matter how many times her sisters gave interviews saying \\"well, that's not REALLY true\\" her stories are the most interesting so they're the ones that get retold.  Ms. Thompson takes everything Nancy has said about herself and her life at face value, no matter how much it flies in the face of reason and record. <br /> <br />She especially enjoys talking about what a terrible mother Sydney was, going so far as to quote a letter Sydney wrote to an adult Nancy mentioning some naughty things Nancy did as a toddler and saying that this PROVES what a distant, uncaring mother Sydney really was.  As though a mother reminiscing about a then embarrassing but now funny incident from many years ago makes her a horrible person. <br /> <br />So, no, I didn't like this book very much.  If you're a die-hard Nancy fan then I suppose it's worth a read, but I didn't feel that it offered anything that hasn't been said before.  I would read Mary S. Lovell's book, \\"The Sisters,\\" instead.	2005-09-08

It pairs beutifuly done drawings with a very straight-faced history of Britain.  The only thing is, that it's all hamsters.  The hamsters wear historical costumes and perform historical actions, and anytime the word \\"person\\" might be used in the text, it has been replaced with \\"hamster.\\" <br /> <br />One page says: <br />\\"One of the low points of the early Middle Ages in Britain was the reign of King John (1199-1216), generally remembered for his reluctant acceptance of the Magna Carta, which enshrined the view that England was governed by laws.  The popular legend of Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest and his merry band of hamsters, who robbed the rich to give to the poor, is also placed in this turbulent period of civil and foreign wars.\\"  The picture which accompanies this page is of a bunch of hamsters decked out in Robin Hood clothes, standing in the forest. <br /> <br />So the gimmick doesn't hit you over the head: the purposefully dry text is a delight to read every time you come across an unexpected \\"hamster,\\" and it is impossible not to giggle at the pictures.   <br /> <br />Though it's called a children's book, the humor is fairly subtle and I'm not sure that a child, who is quite used to seeing anthropomorphized characters in picture books, would find this book to be as incredibly amusing as an adult.  I recomend this book for anyone who likes British history and/or the delightfuly ridiculous.	2005-08-21

I think this book is definately appropriate, and designed for, elementary age children.  In the introduction, the author talks about poring over his parent's books about art, just staring at the pictures, and says that he set out to create a similar source.  I think he has done so quite well. <br /> <br />Each 2-page spread has a large, full-color picture of an important work of art, starting with prehistoric sculpture and going right up to Magritte.  There is also a page of clear, simple text about the piece.  The text is, of course, very useful... but I think that plenty of enjoyment can be had just examining the pictures. <br /> <br />(I know that everyone who looks at this book probably has a \\"they didn't include...!\\" gripe, but I am upset that the Arnolfini Wedding Portrait isn't included).  Otherwise, the pieces are very well chosen. <br /> <br />I think that this is a great book for all ages.  I hope that it will be introduced to elementary school children, so that by the time they are in middle school they are ready for a little more depth and structure in their art history curriculum.	2005-08-10

Some of the projects are very technical (make egg tempera) while others are purely creative.  Some are very artist-specific (a wood block print for Durer) while others could be pertinent to a number of artists (Mother and Baby for Raphael). <br /> <br />If I have one complaint about the book, it is that all of the artists are Rennaissance or later.  It would have been nice to go a bit further back, to ancient and even prehistoric art. <br /> <br />Each project includes biographical information and fun facts about the artist (and his times and works).  Supplemented by a few nice picture books of the works being described (the illustrations in the book are black and white line drawings), it would make a great component of an art curriculum.	2005-08-10

Ms. Stone's amazing sense of color and design are awe-inspiring.  The directions are clear, the photographs georgous, and there is a pullout of all of the paper-piecing templates for easier photocopying (I hate it when you have to take your nice expensive book and destroy the binding while trying to get it to lie flat on a photocopier.) <br /> <br />These quilts are not for the faint of heart, as most include very sharp point and/or curves, but even a beginning quilter will be inspired by her reinventions of traditional blocks, and her designs for highly original new ones.	2005-08-08

The story is age-appropriate, and although it's rather lame and strains in places to be funny (the giant talking animals are a bit much) it is actually fairly effective.<br /><br />Almost the second half of the book is devoted to elementary school math as a review section, and I appreciated that they put that later in the book than the harder stuff: a student who is not doing so well in math is not going to be greatly cheered by a book that starts with \\"2+2=4 and why\\".  By putting the review at the end, it can be read and digested at the student's own pace, instead of the pace of the book.<br /><br />I am using the book for a slightly younger student who is struggling with math, and he is having fun with the scenarios that the story offers.  However, I am guiding him through the problems and explanations: grades 6-8 is probably right on target for a student working independently.	2005-07-15

Sure, it's easy to find plenty of information about the Civil War at any grade level you're looking for... but the picture book about the Teapot Dome scandal seems to be stuck in editing and most online and print resources are definately written at an adult level. <br /> <br />So I was overjoyed when I heard about this series.  Still, I apporached it with a bit of trepidation... did I really want to use a dull, dry textbook?  Luckily that wasn't an issue.  Ms. Hakim has written a fun, easy to read comprehensive history of the US.  They are filled with pictures and sidebars, all photos of visually interesting primary sources. <br /> <br />I wholeheartedly recomend this book to anyone who homeschools, or anyone who feels their kids history skills are not quite up to snuff.  I didn't really get any US history at school until 8th grade, so I know it's a real issue.  You would not be doing your children a diservice if you arranged your US History curriculum around these books.	2005-07-15

It tells the story of, well, the Philharmonic getting dressed.  Litterally.  The story ends when the show begins. <br /> <br />It offers some fascinating concepts of the kind that kids love: that talented individuals are real people too, who take baths and have children and pets; that a \\"whole\\" can be made up of many different parts (1 philharmonic = many different people).  The illustrations are simple but witty enough to call the child's attention. <br /> <br />It makes a perfect bedtime story, by the way, because even though the members of the Philharmonic are getting dressed, many of the rituals mirror a child's bedtime rituals: taking a bath, getting dressed in pj's, saying goodnight to family, etc.	2005-03-15

For the earlier ones, it seems to be not enough information about them.  This is actually rather maddening, since there seems to be plenty of information about the first Ephemia's sister, who, frankly, seems to have led a more interesting life anyways.  But I guess the title couldn't be \\"The Four Euphemia's and One Euphemia's Sister.\\"  It's unfortunate, because the first Euphemia isn't that interesting and most of Ms. Sutherland's discussion of her is made up (in a historian's sort of \\"we don't know, but it might have happened like...\\" way). <br /> <br />So there isn't enough information about the first 2 Euphemias... but then I felt that the information about the other 3 was a bit rushed.  The 3 later ones are all very important, in their own way, and only having a chapter devote to each was rather annoying. <br /> <br />Despite my gripes, the book was a simple, enjoyable read and I learned a lot about Scottish history and the role of upper class Medieval women.  It was interesting to see the proof of social mobility in Medieval Scotland, and basically the rise of a family, and then the annhiliation of a particular branch due to circumstances beyond anyone's control.	2005-03-15

I got this in England for $20... maybe it's just the current state of the dollar. (Edit: the price has gone down a lot since I wrote this review: I think it was about $60 when I wrote that comment)    Anyways, this is a comprehensive companion to medieval England.  It is short and sweet, with simple, well-written entries for everything from Advowson (the right of a patron to fill a vacant benefice) to York.  It is chock full of pictures, diagrams, and maps to illustrate many of the entries and concepts.    Anyone who dabbles in medieval history (even if you would just like certain things in historical novels explained) would benefit from having this book handy.

The introduction provides a thorough description and analysis of the genesis of the Robin Hood mystique, and then in the second and third part of the book each version is individually criticized.  Rhymes, songs, prose, and theatrical versions all appear.  In the last section, the authors provide a sample of other outlaw poetry, which can be compared to the Robin Hood legends.  The authors have also compiles a comprehensive companion to any version of the legend, with maps of places, lists of names, and theories as to the origin of the legend. <br /> <br />This is an interesting and readable book.  It strikes a remarkable balance between anthology and read-straight-through history book.  It could certainly be read straight through, or in pieces.  Even if you're not interested in wading through some of the middle English words, the analysis and introduction is indispensable to anyone interested in the Robin Hood legend, in outlaw mythology, British history, or even the history of the English language.	2005-03-12

All of the \\"history\\" in this book could easily be learned in a children's picture book on the subject, and the writing was just abominable. Mixed metaphors, poor grammar, wrong verb tenses, and not a complex sentence to be seen. <br /> <br />The research was poor and seems like it was done entierly by reading Antonia Frasier books (whose research he then disses in the first pages of the book... NOT cool, dude) and taking a class in pop psychology. He openly admits to making things up and is constantly putting words in his subjects' mouths: \\"That day in the spring of 1489 at Medina del Campo-- was it, perhaps, Catherine's earliest memory?\\" Who cares? Does it matter? Why completely invent an \\"earliest memory\\" for a historical figure that you are purporting to write a biography of? <br /> <br />I am shocked at the number of positive reviews that this book has recieved. Who is writing them, anyway? I know that ballot-stuffing is a problem on Amazon, but how can anyone get though an 800 page book that reads like a second grade primer? Every third sentence begins with \\"And,\\" \\"But,\\" or \\"Actually,\\" he makes up or mis-uses words on every page, the punctuation is abysmal, and the number of three word sentences is truly apalling. This is an actual example of his writing, chosen from a page at random as I wrote this review: <br /> <br />\\"In the middle of the celebrations, howerver, came terrible news. The Infante Juan was seriously ill. Ferdinand rode furiously back to Valladolid. But Juan died.\\" <br /> <br />If you are interested in this subject at all, go straight to the source and check out the Frasier book on the subject. For a slightly easier read, without dumbed-down content, try the Alison Weir. But do not, under any circumstances, buy this book for someone unless you want to purposely insult their intelligence. It is completely unreadable and offers EXTREMELY dubious history.	2005-02-21

Most people who use the term doesn't even realize that it was once seen by many very intelligent people as being a supremely viable form of government.<br /><br />This book offers a great deal of food for thought.  Mr. Paxton seeks to define \\"fascism\\" by looking at the history of the movement, and by examining whether it has any future.  He explains why some regimes which are usually termed fascist really were not, and mentions other goverments that probably should be considered such.<br /><br />This book is rather short and a fairly simple read, making it very accessible to the ordinary reader.  It is perfect for anyone who would like a deeper understanding of fascism and fascist movements.  I wholeheartedly recomend it to anyone who is interested in the history of the 20th century (political, social, labor, military, or otherwise) or who would like to better unedrstand exactly what fascism is and why it was so powerful.	2005-01-09

Living in a futuristic dystopian world where the community ensures that only the strongest and most able survive, she is twice saved from community-sponsored death: the first time, as a fatherless baby with a visible physical deformity, her mother refuses to relinquish her; the second time it is her amazing ability to embroider unique and beautiful pictures and scenes that saves her.    This book offers a different view of the future from \\"The Giver.\\"  Whereas life in Jonas's community was sterile, without emotion or beauty or violence or pain, Kira's world is a violent, every man for himself, anarchy.  Lowry uses this different backdrop to examine different aspects of human nature and culture: whereas Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" was about the importance of cultural memory, \\"Gathering Blue\\" examines the importance of creativity.    This is a well crafted book that offers a sometimes disturbing look at human nature.  I recomend it not only for its intended YA audience, but also for adults.  I recomend that a parent or another adult read this book alongside a younger reader who does so, just becaue it offers so many ideas and perceptions that really need to be discussed.	2005-01-04

However, there are some fairly serious problems with it. <br /> <br />I read it in the contect of Mr. Cannadine's vindictive and pointless \\"Aspects of Aristocracy,\\" and so I found it hard not to keep in mind that Mr. Cannadine obviously and openly finds it difficult to overcome his biases.  At least this book, unlike \\"Aspects\\" was obviously carefully researched... though it is also obvious that he overlooks much of what he found. <br /> <br />Mr. Cannadine concentrates primarily on the economic downfall of the aristocracy, and I think that he over-emphasises some causes while not emphasising others.  There were also some figures that didn't make sense, and when I consulted an economics major that I knew I found them to be severely fudged towards Mr. Cannadine's thesis.  He is eager to blame the aristocracy for their decline, and although some of these charges are true I think that he does not place enough emphasis on the external forces (mentioned in other reviews) which contributed to the declining importance and wealth of the English aristocracy. <br /> <br />So, this book is worth reading if you are interested in the subject, if only because you will be expected to have read it.  However, it should be read extremely critically, and it is worth checking up on Mr. Cannadine's claims with a variety of sources.  I find it interesting that most of the other reviews on this page are quite critical of the book, while giving it a high star rating... perhaps most readers like it because they are supposed to, and not because it actually offers valuable history? <br /> <br />It is also interesting to note that Mr. Cannadine has recently made a complete about-face, and his last two books have been extremely complimentary towards the aristocracy and their influences and contributions to English life.  Perhaps he is angleing for a lifetime peerage?	2004-11-17

The many-roomed manors surrounded by lush gardens and populated with liveried footmen.  From Pemberly to Chatsworth, from Manderly to Blenheim, the English country house has captivated American audiences as we wander from room to room in the ones now owned by the National Trust imagining what it must have been like to live in one of these palaces. <br /> <br />Many books have been written on the English country house, but most are fawning photographic journeys into the picturesque, or architectural studies.  This is by far the best comprehensive social history of the country house: warts and all.  This book chronicles the rise of the estate, when the Empire was at its peak, London at its dirtiest and the cost of wiring and heating all those rooms was not an issue, to the years when these elegant status symbols became ridiculous white elephants that literally couldn't be given away... to their reemergance as cultural and historical artifacts and status symbols all at once. <br /> <br />This book is well-researched and well-written, and offers a comprehensive view of all types of country houses: from the huge palaces to the little cottages that sprouted up in the Victorian period for the middle classes to enjoy.  It even delves into the building rush of the 1980's, when the country home again became popular as the rich grew richer. <br /> <br />If you are at all interested in English history, the history of the wealthy, or the history or architecture then this book is for you.  It offers a nice history of the National Trust and other organizations that own and open these houses to the public.  If you are a tourist who enjoys traveling to country houses this is also definately worth a read.	2004-11-17

It is a great thesis: that the chess queen became the most poweful piece on the board during a period in European history when women ruled, in their own right or as regents, throughout Europe.  It was such a good thesis, and it makes so much sense, and I think that the proof is somewhere, but I just felt that Ms. Yalom didn't know how to back it up. <br /> <br />She glosses over bits that I thought proved her thesis, but then talks a great deal about things that fly in the face of it!  It was quite maddening, because I was really rooting for the thesis.  For example, Queen Isabella of Spain was the most powerful woman of this period, and Ms. Yalom discusses how the powerful chess queen was influenced by her... but then she randomly drops the fact that the queen arrived in Spain long after it had achieved its prominence elsewhere! <br /> <br />The book is well written and the research is obviously there... I learned a lot about various very interesting European monarchs that I had never even heard of... which makes Ms. Yalom's lack of proof even more maddening.  I think that it's worth a read for the history that it does provide... so long as you keep in mind that you might find that the history does not prove the thesis.	2004-11-17

It offers very little historical research, but a great deal of waxing eloquent on the uselessness of the aristocracy. <br /> <br />He gets so into this, that much of what he says is wrong: he describes Winston \\"Churchill's family and forebearers were hardly those which any politician, eager to establish an unimpeachable public reputaition, would have freely chosen.\\"  Um, except that they were all well-respected politicians in their own right, and Winston's father had been considered, for many years, next in line to be Prime Minister (a raging case of syphillus drove him mad and that was the end of that... but his affliction was not public knowledge and wouldn't have hampered his son's career). <br /> <br />He takes great joy in describing the misfortunes of the upper classes, without actually examining the causes: more often than not these declines had to do with the rising cost of living in a huge stone palace (as electricity, plumbing, and heating became necessary), the decline of the sevice industry (as factory work became a better option for the lower classes), the decline of the agricultural industry from which most of these people supported themselves with (as cheaper food could be imported from overseas), and a few significant stock market crashes.  Instead, he drops hints that the sudden and disasterous lack of money was purely a personal fault. <br /> <br />He discusses the people who hang on to their country houses but require government aid to support them, completely ignoring the fact that 1) the government won't let the owners tear them down because they're historic and architectural landmarks and 2) the owners literally can't GIVE them away because the National Trust is already glutted with them and can't afford the upkeep on the ones they already have. <br /> <br />Cannadine's thesis is one that deserves taking into consideration: that it's time historians stopped fawning over the upper classes and started to look at them, warts and all.  However, by the time this book was published, this was hardly an original notion and it was difficult to find a book that didn't take a critical view of the aristocracy.  And it should be taken into consideration that, after a career built on mocking the upper classes, Mr. Cannadine's last TWO books have both been fawning histories talking about how the entire British Empire was built on the bravery, daring, and intelligence of the aristocrats.  I guess he decided the tide had turned and it was time to jump on another bandwaggon?	2004-11-17

Not only is the subject matter well researched and the history complete without ever being boring, it is also presented in a truly imaginative way: as a conversation between Eleanor and several of her friends in Heaven, as they wait for Eleanor's second husband to be released from Purgatory.  Maybe that sounds strange, but it really works. <br /> <br />Through the book, Eleanor and her friends discuss Eleanor's exciting life: her marriage to the King of France and then the King of England and her relationship with each; her relationship with her children (including the two sons who were both King of England), her many adventures.  Ms. Konigsburg manages to do all this without glossing over some of Eleanor's less perfect points, or by sacrificing style, humor, or story-telling. <br /> <br />If you've seen any of my Listmania lists or my reviews, you'll know that I'm something of an Eleanor fanatic... and this is the book that got it started.  I think it's a great read for a girl or a boy, but I think that it is especially important for a girl to know about such an important and influential woman in history.  It is also worth a read by adults, for its imaginative presentation.	2004-11-15

Yes, indeed, some times have changed rather dramatically: I don't have a \\"staff\\" to worry about, for example, but anyone who has ever tried to balance a checkbook for the first time will certainly get a laugh out of Felicity's brave attempts. <br /> <br />This book purports to show the average first year of an average middle-class couple.  It is very funny and well written, and though some of it might not ring true anymore there is enough in it that is and will always be true about couplehood.  This would make a good gift for a young couple just moving in with eachother, or for anyone who wants to remember the happy naivite of young love.	2004-11-12

This book really gives you a sense of how many exciting, important, and tragic things have really happened all over this great big country of ours!	2004-11-12

A lot of thought has gone into the selection of works to be published under this imprint, and the result are a set of elegant books that offer a fascinating window into early modern thought.    This book is a perfect example of that.  Four essays about education have been translated into English, and it is amazing to discover that the more things change, the more they stay the same.  Some of the themes seem amazingly contemporary: the authors deal with corporal punishment (we hear both pro and con views), the importance of physical education, the errors of too much gender conditioning, and (this one made me laugh out loud because I think of it as such a modern issue) the negative effects of over-booking a child's time with extracurriculars!    Anyone who is interested in the history of the theory of education will enjoy this book, or even in developing their own theory of education (for home schooling, say) will enjoy reading this book.  Knowledge of Latin is not required!	2004-11-12

Some of them are quite strange indeed, but there are some classics indeed.<br /><br />You would have to be a very good cook indeed to be able to actually use the recipes, as they use archaic terms and are a little vague on measurements... also some of the ingredients might be a little hard to dig up these days and on this side of the pond (you might want to befriend a very good butcher) but it is still very interesting as a historical artifact, and for brave cooks who would like to see how Yorkshire Puddings are really supposed to be made.	2004-11-12

This book is a pioneering work of social history, where the author set out to write a book about the woman behind the man: quite a revolutionary idea at the time! <br /> <br />It is well written and interesting, and tells a great deal about the running of an upper middle class home in the 19th century: details about hosuekeeping, servants, home repair, and other minor issues that factor into all of our lives but rarely get mentioned in biographies and histories. <br /> <br />This is a great book for anyone who is interested in domestic history or women's history.  Nowadays it is a given that an interesting, educated woman might have a book dedicated to her... at the time it was quite a venture!	2004-11-12

That being said, it is not perfect.   <br /> <br />It seems to be a pretty amateur work, put together by someone with very little knowledge of the theory of learning languages.  I have no doubt that this is indeed the case, and I am very grateful to Ms. Holmes for writing this manual, but I do wish that the publishers had perhaps hired a linguist to work with her.  There is little cohesion between chapters, and I did not feel that the lessons built on the previous ones. <br /> <br />I think that this book would be very good in a classroom setting, where an instructor can add some more structure to the lessons.  A student learning Cherokee on his or her own will probably have some more trouble, but this is still the very best book to use. <br /> <br />I don't see the tapes being sold on Amazon, but I did purchase them at a local language bookstore, and I would recomend not buying them.  It seems that they are for a previous edition... many of the lessons do not match up with the book, and they resulted in creating a great deal of confusion for me.	2004-11-12

She is the byword for upper-class excess, for the demolition of monarchy, and for ditziness.  Visitors to Versailles can wander around her strange little village, where she play-acted at being a commoner, and shake their heads, glad to live in a 21st century democracy. <br /> <br />This book cuts through the incredible amount of mythology that surrounds Marie Antoinette, and offers an excellent study of someone who you may be shocked to discover was actually an extremely complex character.  You might even be surprised at the origin of the infamous baked-goods comment.  You will certainly come away from this book feeling sorry for this much-maligned lady, who certainly was not perfect but was also absolutely not the monster that we teach our children about. <br /> <br />Mr. Frasier is one of the most talented historians writing today, and it is great to see her turn her attention to the other side of the Channel.  Her research is, as always, impecable and her writing style is neat, accessible, and interesting.  Long-time fans of Ms. Frasier will be thrilled with this book, and people who are unfamiliar with her work on Renaissance England will have a wonderful introduction to her work.	2004-11-12

Ms. Fass uses a broad range of original sources to construct her detailed work.

Most books on the subject romanticize the travails of the Cherokee (thus perpetrating the \\"noble savage\\" iconography of the 19th century), or gloss over the non PC parts (such as Cherokee slaveholding) but Ehle is not afraid to offer an insightful and comphrehensive overview of the early 19th century Cherokee Nation. <br /> <br />This book is written in an extremely accessible style: more like a novel than an academic history, and thus can be enjoyed by just about anyone.  It offers valuable information about the political turmoil, in the US and in the Cherokee Nation, that surrounded removal.	2004-11-12

Written by a professor of religious history at Brown University, it is easy to see how he got swept away from his area of expertise and into the amazingly interesting story of the early years of the Cherokee Nation. <br /> <br />McLoughlin does not romaticize the Cherokee Nation, as many other historians do, but tells a clear story of a complicated time and place.  His research is impeccable, and the book is well written.  As to the merit of his historical analysis, it is mind-numbingly and brilliantly ground-breaking: the sort of stuff that a historian goes his entire life looking to discover.  All that I can say is that this book completely changed the direction of my personal study and when I get a PhD in early American History with a concentration on the Cherokee Nation, it will be entierly due to this book. <br /> <br />I also heartily recomend \\"Cherokees and Missionairies.\\"  McLoughlin also has a very good essay on Samuel Worcester in the book \\"Massachusetts and the New Nation\\" which is a major undiscovered gem.	2004-11-12

I failed Biology in 9th grade, and only passed in 10th grade because I begged and cried.  My high school didn't even make me take chemistry, and I'm not sure I even went to half of the physics classes (by that point, they had given up on me and let me take lots of history and art classes). <br /> <br />That being said, this book made me want to go back to college and be a Physicist.  No, seriously, I was perusing online university catalogs until my husband, my parents (who remember the whole high school fasco quite clearly), and my friends talked me out of it.   <br /> <br />And THAT is how interesting this book is.  This is a book that manages to explain the entire history of the universe and the entirety of scientific history, in a fast paced and interesting way.  I guarentee that you'll be a hit at your next party, just drop \\"Did you know that Yosemite blows every 60,000 years, and it hasn't blown in 63,000 years, and when it does we're all going to die painfull deaths?\\" or any of the other amazingly cool tidbits that you will learn from this book. <br /> <br />I plan on reading it several more times, because it is so chock full of information that I think I could read it 10 times and still learn something new every time.  Absolutely no knowledge of science is required, but I have a feeling that even if you had multiple PhD's in the scientific field of your choice, you would still learn an incredible amount from this book. <br /> <br />Anyone who has ever wanted to know why things are the way they are on this earth must read this book.  Anyone who hates science should read this book.  Anyone who likes science should read this book.  Maybe if I had read this book when I was 13 I'd have discovered some new elements by now. <br /> <br />(People who believe God created the world in 7 days and that's all there is to it should probably not read this book: they're not gonna like it)	2004-11-12

This is only the second biography of him ever written (the first was written the the 19th century and is rather fawning, and I'm not including the excellent study of his marriage done a few years back), and it is about time that someone paid attention to this remarkable man. <br /> <br />Though I really got the impression that Mr. Glassner is an amateur historian, someone should just skip the preliminaries and give him a PhD.  His research is impeccable, and his writing style is clear and concise.  This is the type of book that amateur historians always assume that they're writing, though they rarely actually do. <br /> <br />Anyone who is interested in early American history, legal history, the early years of the Supreme Court, or Jacksonian politics should read this book.  Please, please don't hold the fact that it's by an amateur and self-published against it... it is an excellent book and worth reading.  William Wirt needs to be rediscovered!	2004-11-12

First of all, I thought that Elizabeth Ann was far and away the most beautiful name I had ever heard in my entire life.  And I definately identified with the dull suburban upbringing, though perhaps my parents weren't quite so hypochondriatic.  How I wished that some distant relatives with a farm would suddenly appear, and take me away so that I could eat maple sugar candy and learn how to churn butter and rescue kittens and go to a one room school house! <br /> <br />Twenty years after I first discovered this book, it is still one of my favorites.  Written by a leading advocate for Montessori-style teaching, this book empahises the importantes of self-reliance and self-teaching.  Although I recognize the moralizing, now that I'm a grown-up, I never felt it when I was a kid and simply delighted in reading (over and over and over again) about the adventures of Betsy and her eccentric Vermont relatives.	2004-11-12

However, it is an incredibly amusing and deft parody of the cheesy gothic romances that we all secretly enjoy. <br /> <br />Thoroughly modern Flora, recently orphaned, decides to spend the rest of her life mooching off of her relations so she ventures out to Cold Comfort Farm to live with distant cousins.  She is shocked, absolutely shocked, at the completely backwards way they live and promptly procedes to spiff up the place: finding careers for all the young men, men for all the ladies, and discovering exactly what DID happen in the woodshed. <br /> <br />It is perhaps going to far to say that it is completely timeless, and the reader must remember that the events are supposed to happen in a future which is now passed... but it is still a delightful and entertaining read for today.	2004-11-11

The children move into a nearby barn, and procede to tidy it up and create a nice little home for themselves.  But will they be able to evade the nosy old ladies who don't think that Sue can manage? <br /> <br />This is the kind of book that grown-ups roll their eyes at, but that kids love.

Ms. Plowden purports to write a book about the six Stuart Princesses, and no interesting personal detail is too small to leave out.<br /><br />The result is a fascinating study that follows these ladies through childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.  I thought that the parts about their childhoods were the most interesting, since that gets overlooked in many history books.  I definately recomend this book to anyone who is interested in this period, or in fascinating women in history.	2004-11-11

This is an absolutely fascinating book that is indespensable if you are touring around England and want to see some amazingly lovely off-the-beaten-track places.<br /><br />Mr. Jenkins has compiled a listing of one thousand churches throughout England that he feels are worth seeing.  Each church is given a description, including a specific reason why it ranks among the top thousand.  There is such a splendidly wide array of reasons: from architectural details, to unique contruction tecniques, to interesting historical context, that it never gets dull.<br /><br />My parents are taking the book quite seriously, and are trying to visit each of the churches (I think they are a quarter of the way through, and their copy of this book is alrady completely covered with marginalia!).  I have visited several of the churches with them, and always find the experience enlightening and interesting.  Each church truly is unique, and it is always fascinating to see how.<br /><br />Since the publication of the book, many of the churches that are on the list have taken an active interest in their own history.  When my parents first started touring the churches, they were usually met by blank stares and a \\"why on earth do you care about our little church?\\" from the locals... but a few years later they find that frequently the whole community has rallied around the idea that they had an undiscovered treasure in their midst, and something to be quite proud of.  For that reason alone, I think it's a great book.	2004-11-11

Forget Romeo and Juliet... this is the real deal.    A brilliant up-and-coming philosopher is hired to tutor the equaly brilliant young niece of a powerful man... what should ensue but a story that involves love, romance, a nighttime escape with both lovers dressed as nuns, the birth of a child, and a brutal act of revenge that will make men everywhere wince.    Anyone who studied medieval history in college knows of the letters of Abelard and Heloise... the research for this book is based upon not only the original 8 that made their story famous, but also upon what the author believes to be a newly discovered cache of letters between the lovers.  He makes a convincing case for the legitimacy of these new letters, and offers a much more thorough analysis of the story, the characters, and the major events of the period than exists elsewhere.    The author does a wonderful not only telling the story, but also putting it into historical context.  This is a truly powerful story of unrequeited love that has fascinated historians and lay people alike for centuries, but it is also a very interesting history of a crucial period in Church history and in the history of Western Europe.  The first whispers of the reformation are being heard, the Church is starting to punish heresy in very serious ways, and many of the social, religious, and educational institutions are being questioned.  The modern reader might be particularly interested in the life that Heloise makes for herself: her career trajectory might come as a surprise to those who think that, except for the occasional queen, women were completely powerless in medieval European society.    This book provides a very well researched and well written study of two people stuck in a situation that is much greater than either of them, and of the repurcussions that follow their affair.  It offers a very interesting examination of the state of philisophy and religious thought of the period.  I highly recomend it to anyone who is interested in medieval history, church history, or women's history... or to anyone who is interested in reading about the greatest love story of all time.	2004-11-11

It is basically a listing of the thousand houses, all open to the public (though some more accessible than others), that Mr. Jenkins believes to be \\"the best\\" in England. <br /> <br />With each listing is a brief description, including an explanation of why Mr. Jenkins put the house on his list.  These alone are worth reading, even if you cannot travel to each house, as some of the reasons might surprise you: they range from famous personages associated with the houses to interesting architectural details to important historical events. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a book that offers historical analysis about country houses or the wealthy, this is not it.  It is, however, a very interesting travelogue that is essential to anyone who wishes to tour around England and would like to scratch deeper than the usual \\"Blenheim, Chatsworth, Knole\\" trifecta.  It is also fun for anyone interested in trivia on the subject of architecture or English history, as it is full of anecdotes and facts that one does not usually hear.	2004-11-11

I always thought so too, until I actually lived in England and married a Brit.  America is such a big country, but we have so few accents... unlike England where a native can tell what street in which city you grew up on just by hearing your voice!  The system is so concrete that it is impossible to fake out anyone who \\"knows.\\" <br /> <br />This is a sort of difficult book for Americans to read, because we don't really understand just how important language is as a social and class divide in England.  It is still the case, but when Ms. Mitford's essay was first published it was even more concrete.  At times, I grew a little bored of the book because even though I understand that it is a big deal over there, the democratic American spirit in me doesn't particularly like or appreciate it. <br /> <br />The book consists of Ms. Mitford's essay, and several supplemental and follow-up essays and letters about it.  It is worth a read if you are interested in class in England, or in linguistics (though keep in mind that it's best described as \\"anecdotal linguistics\\" and not as a real academic study).  However, it is rather snobby at times, though she tries to cover this up with her considerable sarcasm and wit, and Americans who haven't witnessed firsthand the language snobbery that goes on over the pond might be confused.	2004-11-11

Descended from the women she writes about, she has access to all their letters and diaries and many of their personal possesions.  She takes all this and paints a fascinating portrait of some very interesting women living in a very interesting time. <br /> <br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is obviously the work of an amateur historian.  She has great sources, and she makes them very accessible to the reader... but sometimes I felt that she did not really analyze them all that thoroughly, nor does she draw connections to the wider world.  In addition, she mentions, in a rather offhand manner, that her Victorian ancestors \\"organized\\" the papers that she is using... the Victorians were infamous for destroying family records that painted an unflattering view of long-dead family members or did not support the strict Victorian code of morality.  Martin does not mention her opinion of whether such vetting occured: it may seem like a minor detail, but it had me wondering for the rest of the book if some important details about these fascinating women might be missing, though the author seemed to think not. <br /> <br />If you liked \\"Aristocrats,\\" you MUST read this book, because this book shares several characters with that one.  This is a fun, easy to read introduction to Georgian upper-class women.	2004-08-25

Besides the constant romantic overtones (that often leave the realm of &quot;romantic&quot; and go into &quot;lustful obsession&quot;), there is also a scene were she is about to be attacked in a darkened church by a crazy man who thinks she's his long-lost wife (the book says he was going to &quot;feel her face&quot; but it really didn't sound like that was all that he was after). And WHAT is going on with Teddy and his mother? Talk about strange.  <br />  <br /> I know these were simpler times, but having a crazy man who likes to feel up little girls feeling around darkened pews for our heroine is just over the top. <br />  <br /> The characters ring hollow. Their motivations and personalities randomly change for no reason whatsoever. The reader is supposed to identify with Emily, but it's hard to identify with a heroine that is so completely oblivious to the world around her.	2004-07-30

The first offers a day by day account of the May '68 revolt in Paris.  The second is primary documents.<br />There is not that much written in English about the May '68 rebellion, and until Mark Kurlansky's book came out this was the best source.  That said, it is not perfect.  It is not written by historians, but by two American students who witnessed (and participated) in the events.  They are now both professors, so they are obviously very intelligent, but their lack of historical training is very evident.  This book offers no real historical analysis of the events.  It should probably be considered more of a &quot;collective memoir&quot; than anything else. <br />That being said, it is an excellent source.  The primary sources in the back can be a little thick sometimes, but this is obviously not the authors' fault.<br />Although it is not a perfect book, it offers a great starting point for discussion.  It is worth reading if you are at all interested in the events of 1968.	2004-07-16

In addition to the documents themselves, it offers an in-depth analysis and background information for each source.<br />This is an invaluable resource for any student of history who does not have access to the original documents.

This is not what the book is about, though.<br />The book is really about the history of the expansion of London.  Most of this expansion was indeed due to the wealthy residents of the city, who frequently set up new chic neighborhoods, before watching them be slowly overtaken by slums and then moving on to the next new chic neighborhood.<br />This was an excellent and very interesting book.  It discusses so many of the different neighborhoods of London, as well as the trends in architecture.  It even reveals where you can find the city's remaining Tudor houses.  It even goes right up to the modern day, to the revitalization of certain areas and the building of McMansions English-style.<br />I wholeheartedly recomend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of London, or in the history of architecture.  Anyone who lives in London or enjoys travelling there would enjoy this book, and learn a lot of very interesting things about the city around them.  However, if you are just looking for a social history of the upper class, it is probably best to look elsewhere.	2004-07-16

Wouldn't you rather read a wonderfully researched and well written book by an author who can write coherent sentences?<br />The third book in Alison Weir's Tudor Monarchs trilogy, this book picks up more or less where \\"The Children of Henry VIII\\" leaves off.  It offers a fascinating biography of a fascinating woman, who laid the foundation of what later became the British Empire.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, this is not the book to go for if you are looking to find out about the details of Elizabethan foreign policy or governmental theory.  It is, however, the book to go to if you are interested in finding out more about the woman behind those things.  Weir makes great use of the ample letters that Elizabeth wrote to let us see inside the mind of a truly brilliant monarch.  Yes she used her sex appeal (or at least her eligability for marriage) to guide her foreign policy program, but this books shows us why and how.<br />Chock full of information, this book is a fun and relatively simple read.  Weir is an excellent writer who always manages to find the pefect balance of accessible writing and detailed research.	2004-07-15

However, I was a little disapointed when I actually read it.  Weir seems to recycle much of her information from other books that she has written, mainly &quot;The Six Wives&quot; and &quot;The Children&quot; of Henry VIII.<br />Despite my disapointment, I gave this book 4 stars because if I had read neither of those books, I think I would have really enjoyed this one.  As with all of Weir's books, it is chock full of information and extremely well written.  Despite all the details, it is never boring.  There is SOME new information in here, but I don't think that there is enough to merit a whole separate book.<br />If you have never read Weir, or are looking for a very good intro to life at a Tudor court, then this book is definately worth reading and I wholeheartedly recomend it.  If you are already an old hand at Henry et. al., then you might want to skip this one and move on to another of Weir's books.	2004-07-15

Is it the story of a bunch of spunky kids out to save their father?  Or is it one big metaphysical metaphor?<br />When gawky Meg, \\"new\\" Charles Wallace, and popular Calvin O'Keefe get whisked off across the universe to rescue Meg and Charles Wallace's father, they have no idea that they are part of the greater battle between good and evil.<br />The amazing thing is that this book does not talk down to kids.  It is chock full of graduate-level science, religion, and philosophy.  Classical poets and thinkers are quoted without a second thought.  A relatively obscure sonnet from Shakespeare serves as an important plot point.  But although it challenges, it also rewards.  It is never difficult to read or understand.<br />I have always thought that this book would be a great starting point for a discussion if read alongside Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver.\\"  Both are about dystopias where there is no such thing as individuality and privacy.  How are the two worlds different, and how are they the same?  \\"Aberations\\" are dealt with in surprisingly similar ways.  What is the role of \\"love\\" in both books?  What does Meg mean when she screams \\"Like and equal are not the same thing\\" and how does that relate to the snobiness that Jonah's \\"parents\\" show towards some professions?<br />Everyone over the age of 10 should read this book.  Grown-ups should not consider it a \\"kids book,\\" because it can be read on so many different levels.  It is a classic, thought-provoking book that will be read again and again.	2004-07-15

Although I certainly enjoy the romatic ideas of diamond mines, life-size dolls, and (completly platonic) secret admirers (as all appear in \\"A Little Princess\\") nothing beats the spunky nature and burgeonng independance of Mary, Colin and Dickon.<br />After her parents die of Cholera, spoiled brat Mary is sent to live with her uncle in Yorshire.  She is shocked, absolutely shocked, to find a world that is the complete opposite of India.  Not just the weather: gone is the fully staffed nursery which completely revolved around her every whim (and she had a lot of them) and in its place is a local maid who brings her breakfast and that's about it.  Mary doesn't even know how to dress herself.<br />Appalled at first by the notion of having to look after herself, Mary discovers that it's really not so bad.  Especially when she discovers a secret garden that has been locked for ten years.  Together with her cousin, a boy as bratty and obnoxious as she is, and Dickon, a local boy with a way with living things, she sets about to bring the garden back to life.  Mary and Colin, who have been raised with fairly good intentions and plenty of material possesions but no real love, learn what love is as they care for and nurture the garden.<br />Burnett really has an ear for children's dialogue, and she brings a real sympathy to Colin and Mary even when they are at their most obnoxious.  In addition, their transformation is believable, complete with little relapses into their self-absorbed natures.<br />This is a book that is perfect for people of all ages.	2004-07-15

How could you go wrong?<br />Loosley based on Nancy's own family and childhood experiences (&quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; more so), these stories revolve around the Radletts: an eccentric (to put it lightly) upper-class English family in the 1920's and 30's.  Nancy has created a whole world of characters, each indicative of their time and their caste.<br />I read these books a few years ago, and then read the 2 new biographies of the Mitford girls, and then re-read these novels.  I actually enjoyed them even more the second time!  It was fun to be able to pick out which anecdotes and experiences were &quot;real.&quot;<br />If you are interested in two light, funny novels then definately read these.  Despite what other reviewers have said, they are not &quot;great literature.&quot;  The writing is sort of uneven and sometimes sloppy, and some of the dialogue is a little stiff.  However, they are still laugh-out-loud funny stories about the eccentricities of English upper-class life between the world wars.  If you like these novels then you should also read Winifred Watson's &quot;Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day.&quot;	2004-07-15

She manages to write in a simple, accessible style without compromising detail or historical accuracy.  Her books are fun to read, but so packed full of information.<br />Taking a break from her usual subject of Tudor and Medieval English history, this book examines the life of Eleanor of Aquataine.  It is easy to succumb to hyperbole when writing reviews, but it is NO exageration to say that Eleanor is one of the most interesting people to have ever graced this planet.  Hieress of what is now southern France, she left her husband, the French king, for the English king and took her tremendous land holdings with her, thus prompting the 100 years war and causing the great English/French rivalry that has existed ever since.  She botched the 2nd crusade by tagging along with her friends as &quot;Amazons.&quot;  She brought &quot;the art of courtly love&quot; to Paris and London, thus encouraging the creation of chivalry and the Aurthurian legend, and sponsored some of the most important advances in the arts during the early Middle Ages.  She fathered 2 kings, acted as regent for one while he was on a Crusade, and was imprisoned by her husband for a decade because she helped her sons plan a coup d'etat.  Are you starting to believe that I'm not exagerating?<br />Weir brings all of her skills as a historian and writer to this book, and it is a fascinating read.  If I have one complaint, it is that simply not enough detail exists about Eleanor's life.  It's pretty hard to miss the major events, but when writing about a subject who lived 800 years ago it is simply a fact that very few letters, diaries, or personal accounts exist.  These are the things that let us glimpse into the minds of great people, and it is sometimes maddening that there is no way to understand WHY things happened the way they did.  <br />Despite this, Weir manages to use the little she has to go on to great effect, and this is the best biography of Eleanor out there (though the Marion Meade one is also pretty good).	2004-07-15

The result is that almost all of the 7,500 Jewish people living in Denmark managed to escape the country in the space of a few days, even though the country was already under the occupation of watchful Nazi troops.<br />This book is about that escape.  Annmarie is 10 years old and lives in the same appartment building as her best friend, Ellen, who is Jewish.  One day, Ellen's parents must flee and Ellen moves in with Annmarie and pretends to be her dead sister.  Annmarie, her parents, and her little sister must band together with the rest of the Danish resistance to get Ellen to safety.<br />This is an exciting, fast-paced book about bravery and doing what's right.  The characters are very realistic and human.  This is an inspiring story for any child, and it teaches a very interesting history lesson to any adult who might not know the story of how practically no Danish Jews died under Hitler.	2004-07-15

What happens when he decides that the man doesn't look so evil?  A fascinating search into revisionist history, that's what!<br />Alan Grant, detective extraordinaire, is laid up in the hospital when he comes across a picture of Richard III.  You know, the ugly, hunchbacked guy who murdered his nephews, usurped their throne, and then yelled &quot;My kingdom for a horse!&quot; before dying his much-deserved death at the hands of Henry VII.  The only problem is that Alan, who is never wrong about a face, thinks that Richard looks like a pretty decent guy.<br />With the help of a few intrepid assistants who have access to the outside world, he decides to unravel the mystery of the Princes in the Tower.  He must first work through 500 years of propaganda, lies, and questionable historical research.<br />Is this book the end-all of the pro-Richard v. anti-Richard debate?  No.  It's not a traditional history, and should not be taken as such.  It is a very fun detective story that opens up a fascinating window of how and why historians work, and will inspire anyone who reads it to think twice before taking any history at face value.<br />Although anyone who loves history will adore this book, I think that it would also be a great book for someone who DOESN'T like history, such as a high school student who is bored to tears trying to memorize lists of names and dates.  This book is a fun and quick read that shows how history is not quite as dry or as simple as our textbooks always taught us.	2004-07-15

Drugs are taken to repress sexual urges and even out temprament, and careers are chosen for children based on their aptitude.  Children are raised in prearranged family units.  There is no privacy and no personal choice, but is this really a bad thing if people have no concept of those things?  There is no hunger, emotional pain, violence, crime, war, or sadness.<br />Growing up in this world is Jonas, a bright 12 year old who is about to receive his career assignment.  He is given the important but extremely rare job of \\"Reciever\\": the keeper of \\"memories\\" of what life was like before the creation of his utopian world.  Slowly, he begins to see color, to learn what love, hate, death, and heartbreak are like.  He begins to understand that some of the \\"happy\\" things around him maybe aren't so happy.<br />The brilliance of this book is that the world unfolds gradually.  Lowry does not hit us over the head with an up-front description: in fact, the place starts out sounding fairly normal if a bit Montesori.  Slowly, though, the reader realizes quite how foreign this world is.  Lowry is a deft writer with an excellent sense of subtlety.<br />Ultimately, this book is about the importance of cultural memory.  The idea of cultural memory is probably a new one for kids, and some of the concepts of death and destruction might be a little disturbing, so I recomend that parents read this book too so that they can discuss it with their children.  This in no way means that I think that it is innapropriate for kids: I just think that it is an amazing starting point for discussion about what makes us human.  Please read my review of \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" (also made today) for my thoughts on how these two books are related.<br />This is a moving, thought-provoking book that is a great read for adults as well as kids.  Adults might find it interesting that the idea of a drugged-to-make-them-\\"normal\\" population where everyone is encouraged to analyze and discuss every aspect of their lives sounds eerily familiar...	2004-07-15

If you haven't read \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" first, you really should; and \\"The Life of Elizabeth I\\" picks up right where this one ends.  Usually part 2 in a trilogy is the weakest link between the beginning and the end, but this is an exciting and engrosing book chronicling the reign of Edward and Mary.<br />Edward VI usually gets more or less ignored: probably a combination of his father and sisters seeming much more exciting, and the fact that he became king at age 9 and died only a few years later.  Weir shows that this is unfair: despite his age he managed to smoothly manipulate those who held power over him, and shows a surprising maturity in the letters and papers that he left behind.<br />Mary, poor Bloody Mary, is so easy to despise and/or mock, but Weir turns her into a sympathetic, if pathetic, character.  With no interest whatsoever in ruling, the pressures of the throne, her marriage, and her inability to conceive basically caused her to go mad.<br />Throughout the book we see Elizabeth, but really only as she interacts with her half-siblings.  Still, this book offers the foundation of her personality and drive.  This, as well as the 2 other books I mentioned in the first paragraph, is an essential book for anyone who is interested in learning more about the Tudor period, or Queen Elizabeth.  Best of all, it is exhaustively researched and written in a simple, accessible style that you don't have to be a historian to understand.	2004-07-15

I thought this book was very funny and quite brilliant.<br />It follows the marriage of a sweet English belle to a handsome, wealthy frenchman from a very well connected family.  The marriage is rocky, as the two come from very different backgrounds, but they have their son, &quot;the blessing,&quot; to tie them together.<br />As Nancy lived in Paris and grew up in England, she obviously knows a lot of the details about living in both places.  The details are perfect.  If you are interested in what Paris high society was like in the 1950's, you should definately read this book: Nancy obviously knows all of the gossip.<br />If you've read &quot;What Maisie Knew&quot; you MUST read this book.  I saw this book as quite a brilliant parody of that one.  If I said more, it would give too much away, so just take my word for it.	2004-07-14

The first part takes place when the author was a very young child, and is primarily about his older siblings.  It is the 70's, when the bussing riots are threatening to destroy Boston and the Winter Hill gang was hanging around in a certain auto body shop.  The author makes it clear that a lot of what he tells about these events is second hand, primarily from his siblings and his mother.  However, since they were very active in so many events, and since this book concentrates on the whole family and not just the author, this does not detract from the veracity of the book at all.  The second part takes place in the 1980's, when, in the aftermath of the Charles Stewart fiasco, the police are looking for a martyr to prove that they're not rascist.  They settle on the author's younger brother.<br />The most fascinating thing about this book his how the author manages to chronicle how a family and a community can disintigrate while remaining as strong as ever.  Not everyone in the family, or the community makes it through the book, and as Southie is quickly becoming hot real estate it is sad to think of the community that is being condo'd over.<br />Anyone who is interested in knowing why Boston is the way it is now should read this book.  Boston is still living with the repurcussions of the period that this book covers, and this book offers a fascinating first (and sometimes second) hand account of the events that shaped our city.	2004-07-14

He is best when he sticks to subjects related to mythology (classical, Aurthurian... just about anything, actually) and history, as that is what his background is.  This book, on the other hand, felt like a rush job.  Parts of it made no sense (even for a book about elves), the characters were one dimensional and trite, and the book dragged on f-o-r-e-v-e-r and should have ended about five times before it actually did. <br />If you are interested in reading a laugh-out-loud fantasy book by someone who knows his mythology, read &quot;Flying Dutch&quot; or &quot;Expecting Someone Taller&quot; or &quot;Odds and Gods&quot; or anything that has a historical or mythological basis before you form an opinion of Tom Holt.

It is very light and entertaining, filled with anecdotes about her and her life.  Also featured are stories about her family, but this is not the book to read if you are interested in a tell-all expose of the Mitfords.  Most of the book concentrates on the Duchess's family, and home.  Chatsworth is one of the finest home in England, and one of the first to become a self-sustaining tourist destination.  Anyone who has visited Chatsworth would enjoy reading about the &quot;other side&quot; of that house.  <br />Fans of the Mitford family will be delighted by the stories, most of which don't appear in other Mitford books and biographies.  Even if you're not familiar with the Mitford family, this book provides a fascinating picture of the worldview of someone who has lived a long and extremely interesting life.

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good insights within what is basically a list of names	Considering that America is currently setting up our own little empire, I decided to learn more about previous world empires.  This book is about the effect that Oxford had on the British Empire during that Empire's acme.  It was a little slow to start, as it contains thousands of names, which I find very hard to keep straight.  One or two men are talked about at a time, so it is hard to see how they intereacted on a wider scheme.<br />However, it picked up considerably after the first hundred pages and offered a great deal of insight into the effect that one University (which Americans like myself have to keep remembering is made up of lots of little semi-independant colleges) had on the broader world.  <br />This is not a good introduction to the British Empire, and it helps to be familiar with many of the key figures of colonial rule.  For someone who is interested in the British Empire, though, it is definately worth a read.  It's out of print, but I had no trouble finding it at a library.	2004-07-12

This is Jessica \\"Decca\\" Mitford's story: she's the communist.  A cousin of Winston Churchill, she rebelled early against her eccentic high-society family and eloped with her cousin (not Winston, obviously: a different cousin, who had been kicked out of several prestigious schools for his political beliefs).  She witnessed the Spanish Civil War, lunched with Katharine Graham, lost her first husband in WWII, fled the country just in the nick of time to avoid her very own McCarthy hearing, and dedicated her life to uncovering institutional corruption and scamming of the the American public.  Through it all, she retained her excellent sense of humor, her undeniable charm, and an unmistakable grace.<br />It is a little disapointing that this book ends when it does, as Decca certainly continued to lead a fascinating life.  However, it is always a priveledge to see inside the Mitford family, especially from the point of view of someone who felt that she was an outsider in the family (whether that was actually true or not is up for discussion).	2004-07-12
US	51395973	RGWXAEG2POXFH	0064473511	358845785	A Tale of Time City	Books	5	2	2	N	N	My favorite sci fi book of all time?	While most of DWJ's books are fantasy, this one is pure sci-fi: there is no magic, just plenty of 23rd century butter pies (cold on the outside, warm and gooey inside: I wish the 23rd century would hurry up so that I can try one!).<br />This is the story of Vivian Smith, a girl who is being evacuated from London because of WWII.  Because of a mixup with names, she gets kidnapped by two boys from Time City, a metropolis located outside of time where the officials monitor time and make sure it runs smoothly.  Unfortunately for the boys, the sons of distinguished dignitaries, their \\"playing hero\\" went horribly wrong and Vivian is NOT the girl they are looking for.<br />By plucking an innocent person out of a time period that is already unstable, the boys have set off a chain reaction.  Now they must work with Vivian to put everything right, before Time City itself disolves around them.<br />This is a fast-paced and exciting book.  I have probably re-read it hundreds of times in the past 10 years.  Anyone who likes DWJ's other books should give this one a try, even though it's a little different.  Anyone who doesn't like the fantasy in her other books should definately give this one a try: it's a great work of science fiction, and oh so fun.  I normally really dislike science fiction books, but this one is very well done and avoids the usual traps of the genre.	2004-07-04

It is one of the most beautiful books that I've ever read.  It makes me cringe when people describe a book using the &quot;tapestry&quot; metaphor, but it is really fitting here: the reader watches, spellbound, as a city full of individual lives come and go and interact in surprising ways during a fascinating period of American history.  <br />Everyone is here: the Gilded Age millionaires, the upper middle class suburbanites, the newly-arrived immigrants, the writers and singers and musicians, the protesters.  Every thread that still makes up a city appears and lives and works together.  We see them all, and we see the world as they see it, even if only for a few moments.  The book has some funny moments and some poignant moments, but ultimately it will leave you feeling like you've witnessed some very important events.	2004-07-04

This a travelogue of Dalrymple's voyage along the ancient Silk Road.  It is absolutely fascinating.  He goes places that are not going to be open to Americans for a very long time, and to all of the places  that we hear about on the news every day: Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan.  There is also a lot of stuff that I didn't know about the Palistinian existance in Israel.<br />Dalrymple comes across as an insufferable prick, but a very ammusing insufferable prick.  After all, who amongst us didn't think that we were the height of intellectual maturity as college students?  The only really annoying bit his how he doesn't realize, though we do, how wonderful his first traveling companion is.  Instead, he spends his time mooning over his ex-girlfriend, who the reader can tell is a complete flake.<br />This isn't a great book, but it's a very interesting book, and very fun.  It offers great background reading on the recent history of the Middle East and Southeast Asia.  Anyone who is interested in what's going on there now (and I hope that everyone is interested as there is a war on) should read this book.	2004-07-04

Polly has two sets of memories: one which makes sense and one which makes no sense.  It's easy to see which she believes to be the right ones, but somehow she keeps getting pulled back to her childhood.<br />I gave this book such a low review because I've read it a gazillion times and I still have no idea what happened at the end.

I found the characters all to be fairly one dimensional: flaky mom, mean step-dad, bullying step-siblings.  The protagonists were also a little whiny and self-centered.<br />Despite my personal qualms, I can see how this would be a good suggestion for a child who is not happy about a parent's re-marriage.  It has a very good moral: that even if we don't all get along perfectly, we still all have to work together in order to accomplish anything.	2004-07-04

Spooky without ever being really scary, it is a good read for anyone of any age.    Molly's mother has remarried, and the new family (including Molly's brother Michael and new step-sister, Heather) moves out to the countryside so that the artist parents can have studio space.  Heather, however, is a horrible little brat that tries to make Molly and Michael's life a nightmare.  Since she is younger than Molly or Michael, and still hasn't gotten over her mother's death, Molly and Michael always get blamed.  Even when Heather starts claiming that she can see a ghost named Helen, who is coming to get Molly...    I have a very low fear tolerance, and still can't watch horror movies (Christine scared the living daylights out of me as a teenager, and I couldn't sleep for days), but I still love this book.  I re-read it every year on Halloween for years, and I still enjoy reading it.  Any child, teenager, or adult who likes ghost stories should definately pick this one up.	2004-07-04
US	51395973	R2T4NNOY7A5WV0	0064473546	935348000	The Time of the Ghost	Books	3	4	8	N	N	One of her "experimental" books	Although I usually LOVE this author, I thought that this book was sort of weak.  The plot could be confusing, and required me to go back and read previous bits all the time.  In addition, I found the characters to be a little strange.  The sisters act like nasty old adults at the beginning, and I was pretty far into the book before I realized that they were supposed to be kids.  By the time I figured it out, I had to go back and re-read the whole thing in order to understand what was going on.  Then, suddenly, they WERE adults.  The sudden appearance of the occult stuff was a little jarring, too.<br />If you want a challenging book and like stories that mess with the space-time continuum, then maybe this book is worth a read.  Unlike her Chrestomanci series, this is NOT a kids book.  It contains domestic violence and occult practices, as well as a few other things that might be questionable.  However, they are appropriately done, so the book is fine for YA.	2004-07-04

It is short, and a quick read without any jargon or difficult concepts.<br />This book would be ideal for a person who is not from the US, but who wants to know about how our justice system works and why it works that way.  Much of it is a bit too basic for most US citizens who had Civics in high school and who watches Law and Order obsessively.  I did learn a few things, though, so anyone who is interested in the US legal system (which, as anyone who watches Law and Order knows, can sometimes be quite complicated) might want to take a look if they want some of the more obscure rules and customs explained.	2004-07-04

She comes across a doll, long buried, and sets out to discover why it is there, and what the mysterious cries that she hears at night are.<br />Not a scary ghost story, it is very moving and I found myself crying at a few spaces.  It might be a little cliche for an adult reader, but it is a great read for a younger reader who is interested in ghost stories.	2004-07-04

Sure we know the romance aspects of rajahs and that sort of thing, but we tend to think more along the lines of &quot;Anna and the King&quot; than anything else: and that's not even the right country!<br />In this book, Dalrymple uncovers a very human story taking place at a crossroads in the history of an Empire.  Although the British and the native population lived together surprisingly well for decades, Britain decides to &quot;clamp down&quot; on its colonies in order to make more money.  Fraternizing with the natives will no longer be acceptable.  Acknowledging or celebrating other faiths will no longer be allowed.  Mixed-race children will not be promoted.  Yet what about the marriages and the relationships already forged?<br />Through letters, pictures, diaries, and official reports, Dalrymple paints us a picture of an unconventional family: an Englishman marrying a high-ranking Muslim lady.  How did this come about?  How did it work?  Was it truly a culture-clash, or was it more a meeting and cooperation of cultures?  What about the children?<br />This is a fascinating read for anyone who is interested in the history of India, or for the history of Christian/Muslim relations.  It also shines a fascinating light on the role of women is traditional Muslim societies: something that is usually brushed aside or stereotyped.	2004-07-04

If you're interested in the history of the upper class in the US or England, it is well worth checking this book out.  Parts of it are laugh-out-loud funny, such as the description of dinner with the Duke; others are edge-of-your-seat exciting, such has her escape from the oncoming Germans in WWI; and others are just poignant, such as some of the anecdotes from her childhood.  Like other reviewers, I do wish she had given more detail.  She is a classy lady, though, and only kisses and tells about those she thinks really deserve it (mainly her first husband).  Less fun for the reader, but there's still enough juicy gossip to keep me interested.<br />It is inexpertly written, but I think this ads to the book's charm.  Mrs. Balsan obviously wrote it herself instead of taking the modern route and finding a ghost-writer.<br />If you enjoy this book, check out &quot;To Marry and English Lord,&quot; which expands on Consuelo's story by talking about many other young hieresses of the time who married abroad.	2004-07-02

Who hasn't had a horrible demeaning job with a boss who starts out seeming sweet and eccentric and turns out to be an evil psycho?<br />This book needed an editor: the writing can be sort of sloppy and clumbsy at times.  However, it is always fast-paced and amusing.  For people who doubt that people like this actually exist: they do.  Type \\"Jack Grubman\\" into any search engine and you can see for yourself the insane things that such people do to get their status-symbol kids on the right track in life.<br />I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys chuckling at the foibles of the very rich, but also to anyone that has ever had a thankless job with a psycho boss.  You'll completely identify.	2004-07-02

When we meet the protagonist, her family has lost its livlihood because her father was disfigured in a horrible accident.  With an opening like that, you'd think you'd feel some sort of emotion about the family: it would be hard for an author to make it so that you DON'T care.  Well, Chevalier manages.<br />There was no character that was multi-dimensional.  No one grew or learned anything.  The ending was a cop-out and random.  I had no sympathy for anyone, except perhaps Vermeer's shrew of a wife: I'd be pretty sick of looking after all those kids with such a pathetic husband too.  Somehow, I don't think that's what Chevalier intended.<br />The Dorothy Dunnett books provide a MUCH better insight into merchant life in the early Rennaissance.  Skip this simplistic, poorly written book and check them out instead.	2004-07-02

He must have written it extraordinarily fast: there are events in it that happened only a few months before publication.  That, in fact, is the main problem.  He obviously wanted to offer a critique on current American foreign policy and he wanted to do it quickly.  The result is a book that FEELS rushed: full of recycled plots that are sort of jumbled together.<br />While reading this, you might assume that I didn't like the book because I didn't like the central message.  Actually, the truth is quite the opposite: I only ranked it so high because I think the message is right on the mark.	2004-07-02

Who says that history is boring and stuffy?  This well-researched book is chock full of anecdotes, pictures, and facts to make the period and the subject come to life.<br />This book discusses the phenomenon of the &quot;dollar princesses&quot;: American hieresses who married into titles abroad, particularly England.  Amongst them were Winston Churchill's mother; a woman who was the second-highest ranking woman in the British empire (after only the queen); and maybe the most famous of all: Consuelo Vanderbuilt, who begrudgingly became the Duchess of Marlborough in a marriage aranged by her social-climbing mother.<br />Written informally, with lots of pictures, this might be a great book to buy a teenager who is just transitioning into &quot;grown-up&quot; non-fiction, but finds most of it dry and uninteresting.  It is also a must-read for anyone who plans on traveling to country-houses in England, as it gives a more accurate view of what it was like to actually have to live in one of those monstrosities!  Anyone who is interested in the history of class in America, or of the British Aristocracy, would also be interested.	2004-07-02

Even the title suggests it.  Reading about the history and the current troubles of this tiny nation, which has so much in common with the United States, is both depressing and maddening.<br />This book is a very important read for anyone who is interested in US foreign policy or Latin America.  As Farmer says, Haiti is usually not thought of as part of Latin America (indeed, it's usually not thought of at all) but it should be.  Like all of Farmer's books, it is extremely well written: it is a fairly quick read that is chock full of information, but it is never overly technical.  Someone who is not familiar with the subject or the region (like me, before I read this book) would have no problem reading it.<br />In fact, I suggest that you keep 2 or 3 copies on you at all times.  That way when someone makes an ignorant comment about Voodoo (no matter how multi-cultural and intelligent they're trying to sound) you can hand them a copy and tell them to learn a bit more about Haiti.<br />EDIT - There seems to be something of a smear campaign going on against this book.  The book was originaly published in 1994, and this edition came out in 2003.  Therefore, the current happenings in Haiti are not mentioned in the book.  One reviewer mentioned that Farmer is so rich because Aristide is lining his pockets.  This reviewer is overlooking the fact that Farmer is one of the head doctors at one of the largest hospitals in the US (a post that pays a pretty penny), and teaches at Harvard (ditto), and does frequent speaking tours, is a published author, and much more.  Farmer is also quite open about the fact that he lives in a tiny appartment in a very bleak area of Boston, and puts his tremendous earnings right back into Partners in Health.	2004-07-01

The author, Richard Conniff, writes for everything from &quot;National Geographic&quot; to &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; and is obviously &quot;in the know&quot; on the side.  As a result, he comes off as very intelligent and witty, and I learned more about animal behavior than I did about human behavior.<br />Yes, it is a very witty book.  But it also has a serious streak.  He backs up his stories of gluttony and excess with anecdotal science from the natural world.  He adds just enough history of the rich to provide a firm background and to show that some things just never change.<br />You might be embarrassed to be seen reading it, but it's definately worth picking up.  It's fascinating to see how the other .0001% live, and I guarentee you'll learn something.	2004-07-01

What is it like to have to memorize what a smile looks like on a piece of paper and what it means, because you can't tell just by looking at someone's face?  Why would you put red food coloring in a curry TV dinner?<br />Christopher's affliction is not mentioned, but it is assumed by the reader to be a high-funtioning form of autism, such as Asperger's Syndrome.  His mind is completely logical.  He is brilliant at math, but he can't read other people's emotions, doesn't undertand sponteneity, and can't stand being touched.  It is amazing how well this book conveys Christopher's mind: I find myself questioning whether it really is any less logical for 3 red cars to mean that a happy day is ahead, than it is for sunshine to mean the same thing.<br />One evening, Christopher finds his neighbor's dog murdered.  He decides to launch an investigation and writes everything down.  Along the way, he discovers all sorts of things about his neighbors, his friends, and even his family.  Yes, there is math and science sprinkled throughout the pages, but it is important to realize that this is how Christopher thinks.

Enough has certainly been written about Queen Victoria that you'd think yet another biograpy of her and her family is not what the world needs: but this book is very much true to its title in concentrating on Victoria's childhood, that of her children, and that of her grand-children.  People say that Childhood was invented in the Victorian period, and it is fascinating to see how an ultra-priveledged upbringing changed in the 100 years that this book covers.  Even the changes that took place while Victoria's children were growing up is fascinating: the eldest daughter was married to a German prince at age 15, while her youngest daughter didn't marry until she was in her late 20's!<br />I definately recomend this book to anyone who is interested in british royal history, or the history of childhood.  Since Victoria's children married all over Europe, anyone who is interested in European history would also find this book well worth a read.  Since it is not too long and not too dry, it would also be a good book for a teenager or young person who is ready for adult non-fiction, but wants something that they can relate to.	2004-06-26

It was fairly accessible: but perhaps my ignorance was just extreme.  There were a few terms that I had to google, but overall it was a good introduction to some economic theories.<br />As to the economic theories themselves: just plain brilliant.  Who says that economists have no common sense?  This book just made complete and utter... sense!  I just sat there shaking my head, because sentence after sentence was phrased in just a way to make it so obvious that I wondered why I had never thought of it... and why those who have the power to listen to this book don't do something about it.<br />I recomend this book to anyone who is interested in the state and the future of developing economies.  Frankly, this should cover everyone who lives in North America and Western Europe because (as Sen shows) what affects horribly impoverished people on the other side of the globe affects us too.  No knowledge of economics is required (though you might find Google helpful ;-) ), but an open mind and a modicum of common sense is necessary.	2004-06-26

This book really should have been fascinating: it is so chock full of very interesting information about a range of very interesting subjects... from the art itself to Michelangelo's whiny family to the crazy Pope who wants to be a soldier.  Between the fights, battles,  and plagues it should have been an action-packed adventure through the streets of 15th century Rome.  Somehow, though, the author's writing style is so dry that it has taken me months to get through this book, when it should have only taken a few days.  I kept wanting to get back to it, but when I picked it up I would get so bored that I would quickly put it down again.<br />I don't want to not recomend this book... it is well researched and about some very fascinating subjects.  Other people might not mind the dry writing style.  But you might want to read a chapter before you buy it to see if you take to it.	2004-06-26

Though famous for her children't books nowadays, this is one of Burnett's books for grown-ups.  It is a sort of cheesy romance, but oh is it fun!  Republished by Persephone Books, an independant published in London, this book is well worth purchasing: you'll read it again and again whenever you're looking for a fun, light, and well-written book on a rainy day.<br />Written a hundred years ago, there is a sort of paternalistic-bordering-on-rascist attitude towards the Indian characters, but I don't think it's anything too egregious.<br />When you've read this book, read &quot;Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day,&quot; by Winifred Watson and also published by Persephone.	2004-06-26

Since it is published by a University press, I assumed that the book would be a serious history of a rather fun subject.  However, I was disapointed that there was no analysis whatsoever on anything that Marling discusses.  Instead, it was basically a list of anecdotes, many of which we've heard before.<br />In addition, I felt that she glossed over some pretty key points: such as the fact that the more ostentatious debutant balls are still alive and well, instead of just having transformed into the democratic prom.  There was, for example, no mention of Lauren Bush's debut at the Bal de Debutantes, the party and event circuit that goes on in places like the Hamptons every summer was not mentioned, nor was there any discussion of the &quot;it's for charity&quot; line that the wealthy now use as an excuse to party. <br />The book is certainly not terrible: it is a quick and simple and fun read.  If you ever wanted to be a debutante, the book is definately worth reading.  However, the book would have been much better if Marling had gone one way or the other: either made it a picture book filled with historical photos and anecdotes; or made it a serious history that offered some analysis.	2004-06-26

I was a little put off at first by the poetry-like style, but quickly got into it.  The fact that the language was so spare was very effective.  In a way, I would have liked a bit more detail, character development, an ending that wasn't quite so obvious (though the title makes it clear that it will be) and so forth, but that would have made it a very different book.  Definately a good book for a teen or pre-teen girl, or anyone who is interested in reading a fairly quick book written in an unconventional style.	2004-06-21

After the sheer obnoxiousness of Ms. Hick's glowed from every sentence of last week's New York Time's article, and this absolutely atrocious book, though, I think I'm going to become a neo-communist.<br />Hey, no one is going to read this book looking for great literature, and I realize that asking for biting social commentary is a bit much, considering Ms. Sykes's pedigree.  But there is NO excuse for this book being so incredibly boring.  And such bad writing!  It sounds like a 10 year old wrote it.  Perhaps this is a gimmick meant to show how dumb the main character is (unlikely, since we are supposed to believe that the main character studied Literature at Princeton) but it gets really old really fast.<br />Check out the Gossip Girl novels instead: much more fun, much more interesting, and even the most Princessy characters have some depth and evoke some sympathy.  Ms. Sykes should give up writing and go back to watching her trust fund grow.	2004-04-20

I've never mat anyone who read this book who did not immediately go out and buy it for their best friend or their mother or their daughter.  Most Persephone books are wonderful, but this one is far and away the one to start with!    Miss Pettigrew is a dowdy governess who doesn't much like children and is down on her luck.  She accidentally gets sent to the flat of a glamorous nightclub singer who is having all sorts of man trouble, which Miss Pettigrew promptly fixes with a combination of her wits and her totally common sense attitude about life.    It's a light and very easy read, definitely loose on the realism.  But really, I promise that you will NOT regret it if you buy this book.	2004-02-06

I'm not a classicist, so I'm not really sure why I bought this book, but I am having so much fun with it!  It is filled with short biographical blurbs of, you guessed it, famous women.  The sexism and religious bigotry is amazingly entertaining, as Boccaccio tries to reconcile ancient goddesses with his Renaissance Christian beliefs.  I definately recomend this to anyone interested in women's history (even if they only dabble in it) or anyone interested in religious history.	2004-01-03

All of the \\"history\\" in this book could easily be learned in a children's picture book on the subject, and the writing was just abominable. Mixed metaphors, poor grammar, wrong verb tenses, and not a complex sentence to be seen.  <br />The research was poor and seems like it was done entierly by reading Antonia Frasier books and taking a class in psychology.  He openly admits to making things up and is constantly putting words in his subjects' mouths: \\"That day in the spring of 1489 at Medina del Campo-- was it, perhaps, Catherine's earliest memory?\\"  Who cares?  Does it matter?  Why make up an \\"earliest memory\\" for a character that you are purporting to write a biography of?<br />I am shocked at the number of positive reviews that this book has recieved.  Who is writing them, anyway?  I know that ballot-stuffing is a problem on Amazon, but how can anyone get though an 800 page book that reads like a second grade primer?  Every third sentence begins with \\"And,\\" \\"But,\\" or \\"Actually,\\" he makes up or mis-uses words on every page, the punctuation is abysmal, and the number of three word sentences is truly apalling.  This is an actual example of his writing, not taken out of context:<br />\\"In the middle of the celebrations, howerver, came terrible news.  The Infante Juan was seriously ill.  Ferdinand rode furiously back to Valladolid.  But Juan died.\\"<br />If you are interested in this subject at all, go straight to the source and check out the Frasier book on the subject.  For a slightly easier read, without dumbed-down content, try the Alison Weir.  But do not, under any circumstances, buy this book for someone unless you want to purposely insult their intelligence.  It is completely unreadable and offers EXTREMELY dubious history.	2004-01-03

The moral?  That beautiful people have problems too, and that the children of single family households are stressed slaves without childhoods.  Um, how did that bit get past the PC review board?<br />Poorly written and insulting to anyone with only one parent, anyone who is snubbed by the \\"in crowd\\" for reasons other than being beautiful and perfect, or with a sense of literary decency.<br />I'm appauled at how many people enjoyed this book.	2003-10-01

The authors studied newspapers, visible trends, and interviews with many of the inhabitants of Muncie, Indiana (which they picked and renamed &quot;Middletown&quot; because it was supposed to be an average American town).  What they created was a vibrant picture of modern America.<br />Now, seventy years later, the book is an incredibly important historical work about the 1920's.  Yet it's also a great read: my favorite part was the chapter where all the teenagers complain about how their parents never let them do anything, and the parents complain about how their teenagers have too much freedom and are probably getting into bad things.<br />I definately reccomend this book to anyone who is interested about the 1920's.  Even if you don't like the book, you'll understand why Muncie, Indiana is used in so many pop culture references to average mid-western towns!	2001-12-23

Wier has written a comprehensive geneology of the British royal family, dating back to the 8th century.  There's short biographical data about most of the people, and some of them are very interesting.  It's not a good book to get if you're interested in biographies of these famillies... there's not really enough information about that.  But it's a great book to get if you're interested in British history and want basic facts about the history of the monarchy.	2001-08-10

Perhaps a complaint would be that the book concentrates only on grand houses instead of on houses lived in my middle and lower class people, but I had bought the book realizing that so I didn't care.  In addition to being very well researched and well written, the photographs were absolutely georgous and make me want to live in such a grand estate.  Untill I think about how hard it was to live in such a grand estate!	2001-07-14
