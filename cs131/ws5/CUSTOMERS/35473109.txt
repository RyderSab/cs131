In Boston we thank the Holies for the Cubs - the one team that can make us feel like the smug hosts of champions.  This is a work of extraordinary detail, featuring exhaustive statistics, biographies, legends, &amp; etc.  And although it wasn't written specifically to soothe ruffled Red Sox fans, true students of the team will note than in virtually every topic on offer, the Cubs (and their supporters) are ever so slightly worse off than the benighted denizens of Fenway.  Gentile struggles to put a brave face on all of this, but his various upbeat declarations carry all the credibility of a jubilant North Korean government pronouncement.  The book's very cover contains a subtle concession of abject defeat in describing the Cubs as \\"one of the most successful franchises of the 19th century.\\"  While the Red Sox hardly ruled the 20th century, at least our championship memories are a decade younger than those of the Wrigley wretches.	2003-10-24

Jenny is a willful girl from a sheltered background out on her own for the first time.  Shortly after coming to town she falls in with feckless group of hyenas, and is soon taking a wild tour of the Big Easy's seamy side.  A noisy altercation after a late night on the town lands her on the bad side of a thuggish hippopotamus named Puffin, whose ruthless gang of wolverines dominates every contraband market in the Quarter.  Meanwhile a cabal of voodoo priests is out for Jenny's neck - literally - as they need her larynx (as well as an otter's tonsil) for a purification ceremony that a rich client has ordered.  Jenny pulls through with her wits and her dignity more or less intact, although she does debase herself rather horribly to get her share of beads during Mardi Gras (something that we can both forgive and understand in light of her neck length).  All told a gripping story that can serve as a cautionary tale for any young creature leaving the game reserve for the bright lights of sin city.	2003-10-12

We therefore promised each other that we would be open-minded about religious matters when the twins were born.  In making this vow I was prepared to tolerate a few votive candles and the occasional Hail Mary if the kids ended up going in that direction.  Giddy explorations of the Black Solstice at age four just didn't seem to be on the horizon, but here we are.  The source of all this was a visit by their much-older half-sister - ...Amanda adores her half-siblings, and on visits she always tries to widen their horizons with artifacts from the macabre world that she inhabits out in Los Angeles.  This summer it was the Pagan Kids' Activity Book, and the children took to it like Marxists to a dockworkers' strike.  Basically this is a coloring book, and at Amanda's urging the kids colored theirs primarily in \\"Gothic shades\\" (imagine this phrase in a four-year-old voice - yes, it's creepy) such as Purple, Black, Burnt Sienna, Tempered Iron, Dark Carnival, and Indian Clay.  There are other \\"activities\\" like mazes, which the kids enjoyed (although I think our son cheated on his Wicca Maze), lunar cycle charts, which went over their heads, and guides to making various pagan symbols, which were immediately transposed to their bedroom walls (causing one playgroup mother to ask if our son was already a Led Zeppelin fan, to my considerable amusement).  All told this flirtation was reasonably healthy, as it gave them an early reverence for the natural world, and exposed them to a rather broad operating definition of the term \\"religious tolerance.\\"  Luckily it never progressed to the point of fire worship, and they eventually figured out that jolly old Saint Nicholas and the extravagant booty he lugs down the chimney are deeply connected to their parents' dowdy faith, which returned them to the fold forthwith.	2003-05-06

Herein we learn that Struthers grew up in an old New England whaling village, the eldest daughter of a jumbo jet pilot.  She first became a national celebrity 1970's, and since then she's just gotten bigger and bigger.  Older fans will never forget her massively successful debut in the huge TV hit \\"All in the Family,\\" a show that bravely took on the weighty social issues of the day, winning tons of fans in the process.  In her role as daughter Gloria, Struthers was often reduced to blubbering at her father's enormous insensitivities.  Bulging sacks of fan mail starting flooding in and Struthers was soon living large on her fat paychecks, often appearing in high-paying commercials for Middle American family products including Chunky Soup, Hefty Bags, and Michelin tires.  Struthers' colossal profile landed her parts in a number of films, including a touchstone role as a powerful villain in The Empire Strikes Back.  She has since become a truly enormous philanthropist, taking on meaty problems like Third World hunger.  Her frenetic pace has sadly eaten into her training schedule, leading some to whisper that she has let her physique slip somewhat.  These whispers became a roar in the late 80's when Struthers went jogging after a commercial shoot in the small California town of Loma Prieta, with famous repercussions.  A subsequent NASA investigation into whether her gravitational field was in some way responsible for the Challenger disaster made matters worse.  But Struthers overcame these hard times by heaving herself into her charity work.  The countless awards that she has received for her philanthropy have no doubt softened the pain of earlier years, particularly the U.S. Postal Service's recent decision to award her with her own Zip code.  As this sterling book makes clear, Struthers' voracious appetite for success is wholly unsated, and as the years go by it will increasingly hard to miss the vast footprint that she is leaving on her profession..

For years it was said that the road to modern riches lay in a mastery of Java.  This once inspired me to contact the Starbucks Corporation about acquiring a franchise with the remaining wisps in our trust fund (true story: an ill-starred thrice-great grandfather of mine set sail for Santiago in 1849, having misheard the talk about gold in San Francisco.  This sort of thing runs in families).  The chatter was of course about computers, not coffee, and years later I finally acted on this revised intelligence and sat down before my PC with this outstanding manual, determined to learn the new language of commerce.  Bloch presents an admirably detailed and robustly structured survey of the elements of Java programming (named, I believe, for the Indonesian island upon which it was created).  He takes the young cadet by the chin and methodically drills him through the paces.  By lunchtime of the first day I felt like a union shop steward, having learned to \\"enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor\\" (chapter 2, page 12).  By evening I was high-end a country club bouncer, having learned to \\"minimize the accessibility of classes and members\\" (Chapter 4, page 59).  But by the time I got to the section on \\"returning zero-length arrays, not nulls\\" I was out of metaphors and completely over my head in this black new art.  For weeks I felt inept and hopelessly outmoded, until one day I had the good fortune of hailing a taxicab whose driver was the author of one of this book's rivals.  It was then that I realized that the bubble had truly burst, and that I hadn't missed out on anything after all.  I tipped him handsomely.	2003-02-28

It was written by the doyen of metal detection - Charles Garrett, creator of the eponymous Garrett Infinium LS detector, as well as the \\"ultra-advanced, deepseeking GTI 2500,\\" among many others.  His book is a sober introduction to the art of wealth accretion by way of magnetic broom.  All is covered, from the first \\"bench test\\" before a detector's maiden search, to techniques for keeping the search coil level, to the famous \\"screw-driver probe\\" for pinpointing buried objects.  Shortly after I bought this book my four-year-old son and I passed a pleasant afternoon on a Chatham beach seeking to re-enter the ranks of the upwardly mobile.  By nightfall our plunder included an oversized wing nut (almost certainly from a pirate's ship, I assured my son), three discarded soda cans (good for fifteen cents, or twice that should we make the journey to Michigan, where one can gain double the local redemption rate through ruthless arbitrage), and three pennies that my son regularly planted in front of me to allay his boredom and my flagging spirits.  All told I expect that we would have found more precious metals by combing the beach with a Geiger counter, and certainly would have had more success at spooking the locals (as it was, my cover story of being a minesweeper on secret business for Tom Ridge had few takers).	2003-02-24

All of this may be true.  However, as this revealing book explains, the French have a longstanding practice of hiring foreigners to do their fighting for them - a wise policy in light of the humiliating 2-17-3 record that they have racked up in the past several centuries of European military competition.  For young adventures with an altruistic bent, military service in France compares favorably to literacy work in rural Mali or AIDS education in sub-Saharan Africa.  All are about bringing urgently needed skills to backward regions desperately lacking in expertise.  And as is the case in Mali and sub-Saharan Africa, the crisis in France is only getting worse.  The French workweek is sliding - from 39 hours per week in 1999, to 35 hours in 2001, and soon to 28 hours.  Meanwhile France's population is aging.  And due to unionization, the term \\"military strike\\" is far more likely to describe a work stoppage by soldiers demanding higher pay than an actual armed incursion.  For all of these reasons, the relative value that French strategists assign to foreign soldiers has exploded.  During World War II, one legionnaire was considered to be worth no more than 12.5 French soldiers.  Today a foreigner armed with a penknife is viewed as the military equivalent of a French armored division.  So if a life of public service and relief work is your calling, please consider joining the French Foreign Legion.  This important book is your first step down that noble, selfless path.	2003-02-18

He later personally dreamt up the Ronald McDonald character, but while McDonald's did appropriate his creation, he himself was not invited to portray Ronald (this on the basis of corpulence, as McDonald's did not wish to convey the impression that its food could, um, make you fat).

This detailed and eye-opening guide makes the perfect gift for any prison-bound friend or colleague. Street-dumb executives caught up in white-collar crime sweeps will find the sections on surviving prison riots and identifying deadly prison gangs to be particularly illuminating. I came across this remarkable book shortly after our family was served a notice of expulsion from our social & athletic club. Although our ancestors were amongst its founding luminaries, circumstances had sadly caused us to fall several years behind on our dues, and in the face of our record-setting delinquency the Membership Board surely had no other option. Despite that, I was overcome by an urge to take some sort of petty revenge, and this book proved to be an ideal avenue to that. Our club - one of New England's oldest and grandest - now has a truly national membership, and many of the best-publicized players in the current corporate crime wave are affiliates based in Philadelphia, New York, and (especially) Houston. Since many of these new celebrities are indeed amongst the potentates of the Membership and Steering Committees, I decided to make an anonymous gift of \\"You Are Going to Prison\\" to several of them, with appropriate passages highlighted or flagged with Post-It notes. Readers with similar aims will find Chapter Six (\\"Don't Drop the Soap - Sex in the Slammer\\") and Chapter Nine (\\"Blood In and Blood Out - Prison Gangs and Violence\\") to be particularly rich in opportunities to draw attention to poignant passages (e.g. \\"saw this bit on chain gangs and thought of you!\\").	2002-12-23

On bleaker days they have also turned my thoughts toward becoming a wage-earning tradesman, preferably in a field in which unionization and consumer ignorance have driven hourly rates toward those earned by rapacious corporate lawyers.  For both of these reasons this volume seemed like a wise investment.  It is indeed an admirably thorough introduction to its topic, with illustrations and step-by-step instructions that should render even the most advanced topics comprehensible to a vocational school ninny.  A detailed guide to necessary tools, as well as succinct advice on building an electrician's practice are also included.  However after hard personal experience I have concluded that those who have virtually no facility with their hands should never, ever attempt to splice a High Energy Discharge tamp to inbound wiring that has even the remotest chance of linking back to the main city grid.  Casting a third of Beacon Hill into darkness can generate a certain heady sense of power.  However if this feat is accomplished inadvertently, and in the company of a brilliant shower of sparks followed by impenetrable darkness in one's basement, one instead tends to reflect soberly and humbly on one's own mortality.	2002-12-15

This dual catastrophe leaves home schooling as the sole educational option for our twins, who at four are about to enter our tutelage.  Descending from a long line of professionally useless gentlemen who were schooled largely in dead tongues and the musings of Sophocles, I leapt for this sturdy volume as soon as I spied its title.  As it turns out, the authors stretch the definition of \\"Classical\\" rather much (I don't believe that computer programming was discussed much in the Forum, for instance).  But they do ground their curriculum in admirably traditional topics like Great Books, Math, and Rhetoric, even as they venture into modern realms that are probably necessary topics if one is ever to adroitly \\"short\\" some stock, or whatever it is that one does these days.

Bach grew up at the tail end of the 16th century.  As a young student at the Latin Grammar School (where Martin Luther himself once studied) he was a classic child prodigy, dismissed by jealous teachers as excessively cheeky, and simultaneously made the butt of cruel jokes concocted by the lesser students who were deeply behind him.  To make things far worse, both of his parents died when he was only nine, and for a period he was reduced to selling buns in the street and living in an abandoned caboose.  However opportunity opened the door just a crack when he was a late teen.  This came when he moved to the small town of Arnstadt to try his hand as an organist - a fateful journey during which illness and hunger almost took him, until a kindly cattle-farming family nursed him back to health on a hearty diet of potatoes, rump roast, and healthy dairy air.  At Arnstadt he wrote most of his best-loved early pieces, and while he toiled in seeming anonymity at the rear of the church, the congregation was truly over the moon about him, often straining to hear his gentle melodies over the odious sound of the preacher muttering darkly about Sodom and Gomorrah.  At the time the town was a real hole, but Bach's uplifting passion for music rectified the situation for him and kept him from going under.  Soon many of his most famous baroque pieces were in the can.  Bach's longest residence was of course in the city of Leipzig from 1723 to 1750, where he progressed from early middle age until his doddering later years as an old duffer.  It was in Leipzig that his met his longtime Welsh companion, Fanny W. Tokus, who was to so ease his journey into the ranks of the elderly.  Professor Butt's thoughtful scholarship made this book a real gas to read, and it's uplifting to think that someone so handicapped by his very nom de plume could persuade such an erudite and impressive group of credentialed co-writers to hitch their wagons to his tailpipe.book a real gas to read, and it's uplifting to think that someone so handicapped by his very nom de plume could persuade such an erudite and impressive group of credentialed co-writers to hitch their wagons to his tailpipe.	2002-12-11

A must-have reference for anyone coveting a piece of Haiti's \\"go-go\\" economy.  Its authors do an admirably thorough job of scouring the countryside for deeply contrarian business opportunities, rather than limiting themselves to the usual suspects in Port Au Prince's industrial and technological corridor.  I'll admit it - I originally bought this guide on something of a lark, specifically as a gift for our family's trustee.  By way of background, the trust department of an esteemed Boston bank has been abetting the decline of the Higgensworth clan for almost a century.  Each generation, a new trustee is granted absolute authority over our assets (think of it as a serial dictatorship along the lines of North Korea, with the sole oppressee being our finances).  During the Eisenhower era they poured millions of Higgensworth dollars (yes, there were millions of them once) into Wham-O! Corporation stock just as the Frisbee and Hula Hoop manias were collapsing.  Under Carter they bought a large stake in a Chiclets factory in Iran, which did wonderfully until Khomeini took over and turned it into an interrogation center for unveiled women.  Then during the Diet Roosevelt years they stodgily stuck to treasuries and municipal bonds until March of 2000 - when they couldn't take it any more and finally bet heavily on the Internet.  When I came across this book, I couldn't help but send it to our designated Mandarin over at the trust department with a peevish note suggesting that he comb it for investment possibilities.  He either missed the implicit irony, or detected it and deeply resented it, because scarcely a month later I received a notice indicating that we are now 1/17th owners of a chicken processing plant just outside of Verrettes - a small industrial center in Haiti's Artibonite province.  Haitian poultry processors are said to enjoy tremendous efficiencies, since local religious practices create high demand for exotic internal organs that Americans don't buy.  For this reason I am hopeful that this story will have a happy ending.his reason I am hopeful that this story will have a happy ending.	2002-12-10

Which is, in a sense, one of the scant but meaningful advantages enjoyed by women in conservative societies, as the voices in this insightful book make abundantly clear.  If 'liberation' means appearing on the cover of \\"Maxim\\" clad in a thin veneer of Silly String, many would think twice about buying into the modernity that we're peddling.  This insightful book elicited a passel of new notions in me about the need for enlightened relativism when comparing modern and traditional societies.  All of which were moderated abruptly when I shared them with my wife - who herself was recently 'liberated' from the beaches of Punta Del Este, where the garb of most Maxim girls would be dismissed as laughably prim.  Her predictable response was to christen me 'Mullah Charles' and to withhold her affections from me for a week - a modern Lysistrada, albeit one without a Peloponnesian War to stop.  My bumbling attempt at atonement - trying to assert my modernity by boorishly commenting that author Mehta looked \\"rather hot\\" in her inset photo - only proved to both of us that I have plenty to learn about women from my own hemisphere, never mind the other one.	2002-12-07

Top it off with a decaffeinated stock reduction and you're a host whose meals will be recounted for decades. This book has afforded us years of excellent in-home dining, as well as cheap laughter. My wife also once used it to great effect in ridding us of an in-law babysitter that she considered too sultry and promiscuous for duty. She merely left Carmen (her young cousin, who served briefly as our sitter to my unbounded delight) with a tray of Chicken Satay Latte that she had secretly made with thrice the active ingredient. Carmen dutifully served it to the twins at dinnertime, and by the time we returned she had permanently sworn off of babysitting - as well as motherhood, marriage, and quite possibly the male gender, which she rightly surmised was in large part to blame for the scourge of children.	2002-12-07
US	35473109	R32KF9MSP6WYUR	0919695043	367232116	Tanelorn Archives: A Primary and Secondary Bibliography of the Works of Michael Moorcock, 1949-1979	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A Modern Melville	Michael Moorcock is one of the most promiscuous writers in 20th century literature, as even a cursory examination of this bulging bibliography shows - and he has put another 20 years of output under his belt since its publication.  Science fiction was not considered to be the cream of the literary crop when he started his work, but he began to erect a towering literary edifice despite that.  He initially found the writing life to be very, very hard, as his first two books completely stiffed.  This was a terrible blow, but things started coming to a head in the early 1950's when he authored two seminal novels.  After that the books just kept coming and coming.  This excellent bibliography chronicles each of these creative climaxes, while sucking the reader in with an explosive flow of biographical notes, including some intriguing asides about the author's relationship with his brothers Harold and Richard.  His fascination with the works of Melville is also chronicled extensively.  Exhaustive as it is, a bibliography by definition can only prick the surface of its subject, and the reader is encouraged plunge into the primary sources on his own.  Those heeding this call will have a ball.<br />The prodigious output chronicled in this bibliography can best be understood in the context of American society under Eisenhower.  Back then, one dated little unless there was some promise of marriage in the end, and young ladies invariably took on the names of their gentlemen when they wed.  These two cruel facts no doubt left Moorcock with a great deal of time on his hands when the other young bucks were courting the local damsels.  He and society have since grown up however, so one expects that he no longer has to tolerate oafish wits making infantile cracks about his surname.	2002-12-05

This book has a certain personal relevance for me because we have a Cujo of our own - a tiny little Bijon Frise (if you're not familiar with the breed, think of a toy poodle, only one specifically designed for wimps).  We selected him based on the unlikelihood of his devouring our newborn twins - although now that they have grown up a bit, our concerns tend more in the direction of the twins devouring him, particularly our son, who has exhibited exotic dietary preferences.  I initially sought to give our pet a fitting name along the lines of Bitsy, Poofblossom, or Fluffmuffin.  However I was overruled by my wife, who insisted on Cujo.  You see Carlotta is far younger than me, and occasionally hatches little pranks that play on my relative ignorance of popular culture (true story: I almost consented to naming our slightly pudgy infant son \\"Cartman\\" after she persuaded me that this was the name of a faded but celebrated aristocratic family from Maine).<br />Anyhow, Cujo the book is another gripping tale from the venomous quill of Steven King.  In it, a friendly Saint Bernard is bitten by a rabid bat.  Soon enough he's demonstrably losing his mind (foaming at the mouth, biting without provocation, stalking small children, even campaigning on behalf of the local Democratic Party in one particularly unsettling scene).  The finale is a dramatic showdown between Cujo and some family members that he corners in a parked car.  As Cujo starts bashing the car's windshield in with his head, one is forced to think of one's relationship with one's own dog.  I once thought that our Cujo was the devil's own seed due to his penchant for pilfering food intended for me and as well as his occasional gassy episodes.  But on the balance I suppose we're doing just fine with the old boy.	2002-12-03

An excellent narrative marred only by an ironic lack of illustrations.  This made it slow going at storytime for my daughter Priscilla, who at four is already a big Kahlo fan (an eerie development that would have been significantly more worrying had it arisen in her twin brother).  She claims to be drawn to Kahlo solely by her artwork.  However her mother and I suspect an unvoiced sympathy for Kahlo's leftist politics as well - a suspicion that deepened during the recent dock workers' strike on the West Coast, which Priscilla stridently supported.	2002-12-01

I myself was bitterly disappointed to make this discovery.  However since I was trapped in the purgatory of traffic school when I furtively cracked its cover, I decided to forge ahead with this ghost-written autobiography of the founder of Dunkin' Donuts anyway.<br />I was soon swept up by the exhilarating story of a relentless entrepreneur's rise to the top of the glamorous but cut-throat world of donut manufacture &amp; distribution.  I was also smitten with no small amount of civic pride, as Dunkin' Donuts sprang from the loins of my own native Boston.  The narrative is interspersed with intriguing facts about the donut industry and its history.  For instance, did you know that the modern word \\"donut\\" is a simplification of the word \\"doughnut,\\" which itself evolved from the archaic term \\"dough knot\\"?  Nor did I, sir.<br />Your inner Homer will be thrilled with this book and its lessons.  And at just over 200 pages, it's the ideal length for a day-long sentence to traffic school at which attention must be periodically feigned.  However this will limit your absorption of any important lessons being imparted.  I myself learned this the hard way, when I caused a minor accident immediately upon leaving the school's parking lot by failing to signal.  The delicious irony of this was not lost on my instructor, who had sullenly resented my divided attention throughout the day.	2002-12-01

They're also deeply aware of the fact that a certain Mr. H. Potter is newer than Snoopy and cooler than Bozo.  Noting the author's sterling name I acquired this work - a dated and out-of-print account of a Navajo women's group attempt to gain financial atonement from the New Mexican government for some ancient wrong - through an online auction for three dollars.  It now sits on a coffee table, exciting a reverential awe in the little ones, who have been told that this tale will not be featured at story time - if they want to access it, they'll need to read it themselves.  The result has been a welcome renaissance in their neglected literacy program, which they're now attacking like Huns at the gates of Vienna.  All in all, a seductive and affordable inducement for distracted children to finally master the wiles of the silent \\"E\\" (a lesson we were previously stuck on for fortnights).	2002-11-29

Each step of our exploration is tied to observations about the traits and habits that characterized the creature before its unfortunate arrival at our operating table.  For instance, penetrating insights into feline psychology are offered as we \\"split the hemispheres\\" of the subject's skull, and inventive theories about the breed's fecundity are offered as we explore its nether regions.  I would highly recommend this work to anyone wishing to gain or impart a better understanding of biology.  However, I would not advise anyone to repeat our attempt to parlay the untimely death of a beloved pet into an anatomy lesson for under-fives.	2002-11-19
