How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	3	8	12	N	N	Doubting Thomas Frank	Who knew what trouble brews on the endless Kansas plain?  For those of us whose references to the state go no further than Dorothy's homesick yearnings it's instructive, and even disillusioning, to learn that Kansas' political storms can make its tornadoes seem like spring rain.  From the nineteenth century populism of Eugene Debs to the late 20th century extremism of the Kansans for Life, Kansas has shown a propensity for edgy political foment as violent as it is schizophrenic.  <br /> <br />Thomas Frank, in his socio-personal screed \\"What's the Matter with Kansas\\", makes a great case for his home state as the mirrored petrie dish for social and political movement nationwide.  At the literal crossroads of American life, Kansas, in the rendering of the saturnine Mr. Frank, takes everything on the chin, preyed on by big business, betrayed by the government, and condescended to by the haughty East coast establishment.   <br /> <br />But this isn't what drives Mr. Frank to angry despair.  Rather, it's his home state's reaction to all this torment.  Kansas, it seems, is a glutton for punishment.  When Boeing leaves the state in the lurch with thousands of jobs on the line, Kansas meekly accedes.  When free trade agreements trump the carefully constructed protections on beef and cattle, Kansas rolls over.  When the federal government cuts jobs retraining programs and transfer payments, Kansas nods in assent.  After all, says the state's hardy collective conscience, what suits the suits must be good for us.    <br /> <br />Ultimately, Frank instructs us warily, it's not just Kansas that will pay the price for its collaborative victimhood.  Its political and social delusions have demonstrated the power to mestasize, and ultimately, one imagines, bring America to its knees.  But why?  Why would such bright and enterprising folk as his fellow statesmen let things come to this?  <br /> <br />Answers to this central question are elusive in the book, but Frank does an estimablejob of exposing the historical social and political structures that have led to an ostensible rejection by an intelligent population of its own self-interest.  In short, in Kansas as elsewhere, extremism and an obsession with social order have enabled a canny business community to exert its economic power and influence unfettered by the clear thinking of the oppressed masses. <br /> <br />Its an interesting premise, but ultimately unconvincing.  Frank's take on business as an agent of evil is as unoriginal as it is specious, and it often undermines his otherwise engaging and thoughtful analysis of mass psychology and its sometimes pernicious effects.  While the book focuses on the disconnect between economics and social policy, Frank skims conveniently over the more complicated aspects of a pro-business fiscal platform, ignoring even the possibility that tax cuts can have a salutory and growth inducing effect on an economy, rather than simply paying for another errant Boeing exec's villa in St. Tropez.    <br /> <br />No, Frank is far more interested in settling grudges, many of them apparently personal, and that is a shame, because a lot of what he says is timely and true.  The most rigorous political treatment he offers here, one that is both trenchant and thoughtful, involves the complicated splits and fissures that have taxed the Republican party from within.  And, as  throughout the book, he does a nice job of extrapolating these conflicts from the state to the national level.  <br /> <br />But so much of the rest of the book is conjecture and outraged polemic that he ultimately robs himself of credibility for his overall point.  It seems the author is too emotionally engaged in his home state to see through the rhetoric and absolutes that he so decries in others. Nothing personal, Mr. Frank.	2005-10-04

As a theater of human baseness it has no equal; beginning with instinct, and moving on up through decency, honor and love, war demands the renunciation of every more humanity has struggled through centuries to weave into the permanent fabric of civilization.  At the end , it leaves nothing but shredded bodies, traumatized psyches, and the promise of other, more horrific wars in the future to slake mankind's evil compulsions. <br /> <br />Would that it were so simple.  Pat Barker's \\"Regeneration\\" trilogy, an anti-war blend of obscure history and eloquent fiction, presents a different picture, one that articulates a side of war more frightening than the accepted version of brutal violence and noble self sacrifice.  War, more than just a senseless cacaphony of carnage, can be coldy rational--a laboratory, as it were, for experiments on human capability. <br /> <br />Barker weaves her story around a long forgotten true historical personality named Siegfried Sassoon, a decorated officer who in 1917 was sent to an asylum for the crime of denouncing the Great War as a senseless staging of slaughter nightmares.  His confinement under the supervision of Dr. William Rivers leads doctor and patient into a dialog filled with critical insights into the nature of logic, sanity, and the human longing for connection.  In the process Dr. Rivers finds himself unravelling in a malestrom of unanswerable questions about everything he's deemed valuable.  Who is running this asylum? <br /> <br />Fact or fiction, criminal or noble, hero or coward?  Poor Dr. Rivers obsesses over these questions even while Siegfried, the ostensible hysteric, continues on his one man mission, comfortable in his skin, certain in his convictions, an intimate friend of the truth.  In the process several other characters weave in and out of the story, each with his own piercing perspective on cruelty and the high cost of violence.  They are each of them, invarious and demented ways, the subjects of experiments, the goal of which is to discover something new in the forward thrust of existence.   <br /> <br />Barker's title, \\"Regeneration\\", refers to the advances medical science attempted during this period in reattaching nerve endings and rendering wounded men amubulatory and sensate again.  But what will they feel?  As people play their games and play God, for the vaguest, most obscure of selfish reasons, can there be any outcome from their human tinkering but misery and alienation?  <br /> <br />In this saga Barker, whose writing style illuminates her characters' internal wars with beautiful shades of grey and splashes of red, implies that Siegfried has it figured out.  We all want to know more about the answers he's discovered.  But most, like this reader, will find themselves tripping, with Dr. Rivers, through a swamp of uncertainty into the quicksand of despair into which all war descends.	2005-09-12

George Washington was that rare mortal whose apotheosis started long before his death.  Beginning with his unlikely triumph over the British during the long and brutal revolutionary war, Washington exerted a hold on the national psyche unmatched by most kings, and by no subsequent presidents.  In the proud annals of US History, he lives in a place of honor separate from all others.  <br /> <br />From this premise does Joseph Ellis seek to deconstruct, but not to denigrate, the Washington mystique.  The title the author chooses, like the rest of the devices employed in this careful, studious biography, is deliberate.  Washington's place in society, as a general, a president, the pinnacle of the Virginia landed elite, demanded a moniker that hinted at the superhuman.  But his famous refusal of royal station left a vacuum of nomenclature, a natural metaphor for the political void left in the wake of the British troops vacating the fledgling state.  Washington's title, like the rest of the nascent political culture, derived from ad hoc experiment.  Some called him Majesty, some Honorable, some Excellency; but all called him great. <br /> <br />Ellis personal affection for \\"the foundingest father of all\\" often shows through his restrained and scholarly style.  He can scarcely conceal his excitement when he informs us in the preface of his opportunity to access the modern edition of the \\"Washington Papers\\", \\"all the scattered pieces of paper in the attic...gathered together, catalogued and classified\\".  Only a historian of Ellis' passion can evoke the thrill of plumbing a subject which has, obviously, lived large in his imagination since boyhood. <br /> <br />But Ellis, to his credit, never gets carried away, and has delivered a remarkable work devoid of any hint of hagiography.  He weaves together themes with a careful integration of fact and analysis as he guides us through Washington's formative years, the compelling story of hisengagement in the French and Indian War, and on through his better known trials as Commander in Chief and President of a new nation.  The story, of course, works on its own merits, but Ellis gives it flesh, offering up credible conjecture about how Washington's psychology and temperment moved the world. <br /> <br />And though he doesn't make the mistake of deifying Washington, he does spend a lot of time praising with faint damnation.  From Ellis we get a sketch of a man almost too determined for his own good, stubborn to a fault, and laconic due to a lack of natural intellecutalism.  But each one of these \\"faults\\" can, and is, in Ellis' rendering, transmuted to a strength.  He may have been lucky from time to time, Ellis seems to say, but he was meant to be lucky.  Some people are fated for real greatness--despite Washington's occasional best efforts to the contrary, he was one of them.	2005-08-04

Imagine a young girl whose mind is a lush, fantastical playground, filled with romps through history, alive with visions of chivalry and love.  Her world is one apart, the realm of a nascent writer, where the possible, the real, the truth and the lie play out on an ethereal plain of mystical logic.  In the throes of discovery, amidst the first strange stirrings of love and desire, she does something horrible.  Her crime, which in her eleven year old mind comes to life wrapped in a mantle of courage and outrage, lives on past her time of delusion, beyond her ability to control, unleashing forces that destroy those she loves.  Its consequences become her world.  <br /> <br />This is the trap Ian McEwan sets for his heroine Briony Tallis in his masterful novel \\"Atonement\\".  Told in different stages in time, the novel opens during a torpid English summer in 1935 at a non-descript country estate, where various members of an unsettled family of landed gentry have gathered in an desultory attempt to vanquish the season's languor. It's hot, stifling, bursting with the possibility of searing summer storm.  And with a playwright's sense of timing, Briony unleashes one that never ends. <br /> <br />Gathered at the Tallis home are a restless group of family and friends including mother Briony's mother Emily, sister Cecilia, family protege Robbie, gadabout brother Leon, and Leon's pompous friend Paul Marshall.  The adults move about under the careful eyes of Briony and the other children, her cousins Lola and Lola's twin brothers.  When Briony's attempts to produce her first play in the mansion's basement fall apart, she turns her attentions to the real world with a vengeance, slandering her sister's lover Robbie with a charge of something so awful that, in Briony's feverish imaginings of evil, it has to be true. <br /> <br />Five years later, Briony has grown, war has arrived, and all the realities she's staved off for so long have come to terrifying life.  Her victims, the steadfast lovers Cecilia and Robbie, have lived past her charges, spent time in prison, pledged undying love for each other, begun to grapple with the horrors of war.  But the scars Briony inflicted are open and oozing, and she has come to acknowledge that healing those wounds must be her life's work.  But how? <br /> <br />McEwan has an answer for us, but it's not the one we yearn for.  Throughout the book he plumbs his characters' minds with internal dialog so intricate the sentences feel like threads in an enormous tapestry of language, telling a story of sweeping tragedy and personal innocence.  But it's not only the workings of the psyche where McEwan's formidable strengths as a writer evidence themselves; his description of war, its vagaries and cruelties, serves both as powerful metaphor for his characters' internal struggles and a reminder of the ease with which delusion can become hideous reality. <br /> <br />The novel concludes in contemporary times, with Briony on the verge of senescence and dementia, pining to change what memory tells her is true.  Does she gain redemption?  In a sense, though McEwan leaves his readers with a vague feeling of unfulfillment, an ethereal satisfaction that seems as transitory as the pages of a yellowing fairy tale.  In his renderings of human imperfection and the pain and pathos they bring to bear even in the lives of the good, McEwan has crafted a powerful testament to the fragility of preciousness of life.    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-01
US	52172461	RFDR166M1WOI4	0375757309	279496882	In an Uncertain World: Tough Choices from Wall Street to Washington	Books	5	5	7	N	Y	A Probable Man	If there was ever a living argument for Wall Street training for all future Treasury Secretaries, it's Robert Rubin.  The skill set he brought to bear during his six years as a central player in the Clinton administration (at NEC and Treasury respectively) injected wisdom, calm, and cool rationality to a host of late '90s financial crises.  Traditionally the preserve of sedate retired CEOs accustomed to measured, bureaucratic decision making and drawn out consequences, Treasury in the late '90s had some adjusting to do.  Robert Rubin proved himself more than up to the job, riding the tiger of lightning fast capital mobility abroad and spiralling deficits at home into an era of unmatched propserity and hope. <br /> <br />Rubin's probablistic approach to problem solving is the central idea around which he builds his compelling biography, doubling back to it again and again as he rises through the ranks of the arbitrage desk at Goldman Sachs and then through his tumultuous tenure in the Clinton cabinet.  For every problem there is a set of solutions, he asserts, each with offsetting levels of risks and benefits. It's the effective measurement of these solutions that provides the central ingredient for successful problem solving at every level. <br /> <br />On the arbitrage desk at Goldman his mastery of disciplined situational analysis reached its zenith in a number of complex hedging deals that yielded enormous profit both for himself and the venerable firm.  But even more important (at least for the nation and the world later on) the experience left him with an intuitive sense of the way currencies and interest rates interact, the powerful impact of economic expectations on growth and inflation, and the perils and pitfalls of spreading risk among ever more disparate financial intermediaries.   <br /> <br />These internalized lessons, along with a personal fiscal prudence and a fundamental belief in government as an agent of good, led Rubin into his most famous incarnation at Treasury, that of deficit hawk.  Administration policy coalesced, through Rubin's skillful and often impassioned salesmanship, around a theory of economic growth through low long term interest rates, a scenario possible only under a regimen of budgetary discipline.  Thus began the long and ultimately successful slog of the administration and the Democratic party toward a new incarnation as the standard bearer for balanced budgets and low interest rates, an effective reversal of forty years of institutional practice. <br /> <br />In the meantime, in the greater world, the internet had arrived and capital controls had fallen throughout the former second world of communist nations, enabling capital to flow unimpeded and with ruthless speed among nations and financial institutions.  The immediate result of all this dynamism was the hair raising spectacle of debt and currency crises from Mexico to Russia, all of which occurred during Rubin's watch.  The consequences of mismanagement in these situations was no less than world economic collapse, yet the treasury secretary's skillful stewardship replenished the store of that most precious of economic commodities, confidence.       <br /> <br />Rubin's mind is one the world still needs, and happily he seems to want to continue to share it.  In this work he's generous with references to his personal life and history.   More influenced by his politcally active grandparents than his own mother or father, Rubin developed a sense of social responsibility coupled with respect for market forces at an early age.  All through his education at Harvard, the London School of Economics, and on through his various careers, his sense of decency and civic obligation dominates his thinking. For a guy determined to remove emotion from problem solving, he maintains some core values that defy cold exmination.   <br /> <br />That might be one reason why his arguments against tax cuts, delivered later in the book, seem one-sided and doctrinaire.  While he shares the goal of strong growth (who doesn't?) with policy makers in the present administration, he categorically rejects the idea that lower marginal tax rates can lead to this end.  Nor does he evince any inclination to attack growing deficits from the standpoint of cutting spending.  His battle with the Gingrichites ten years ago has left him in an ideological vacuum in this one regard.   <br /> <br />But he could be proved right, as he has so many times before.  Quibbling with Robert Rubin's instincts is rationally, probably, not a good idea.  If he is proved wrong, however, on any point, look for Rubin to accept it with out sour grapes.  It's the world's greater good he strives for, not his own ego, and for one man, he's taken the world a long way.	2005-06-01

Anyone who's attended a top university in the US knows the courage it takes to challenge political orthodoxy in the rarefied palaces of academe.  Yet during the campus backlash years of the Reagan administration, when students and professors busied themselves with anti-apartheid sit-ins and protests over human rights abuses in Nicaragua, Dinesh D'Souza made a splash, and more than a few enemies, when he founded the dissident conservative college paper \\"Dartmouth Review\\".  The very name, with its less than subtle evocations of another well-known conservative maverick, caused a collective shudder of fear and loathing through the armies of radical activists standing guard over the fading glories of the 60s.  <br /> <br />Since that time D'Souza has carved a niche of respect for himself in American intellectual life with his writings on American politics and sociology.  His controversial recent works, \\"Iliberal Education\\" and \\"The End of Racism\\", were an out and out declaration of war on the system of leftist elites which preside over the development of thought at the nation's universities, and a systematic and devasting dissection of the cult of political correctness and its pernicious effect on the psyche of American society.  <br /> <br />In \\"What's So Great About America\\", a lengthy post 9/11 analysis of what's gone right in the US and wrong most everywhere else in the world, D'Souza is at his most convincing and least doctinaire.  He's matured as a writer, and approaches this work with the confidence of a battle scarred survivor with no axe to grind, just hard-won wisdom to share in a dangerous, unsettled world.  <br /> <br />It's refreshing how unafraid he is to put controversial topics on the table, challenging the reader to interpret only the facts that history gives us, the truth as we know it, unalloyed by ideological contamination.  He fuses heart-felt patriotism of the old fashioned kind with reasoned, thoughtful analysis.  An intellectual who actually pens chapters with bold faced titles \\"The Reparations Fallacy:  What African Americans Owe America\\", and \\"Two Cheers For Colonialism: How the West Prevailed\\", and then lays out his ideas with good natured, and convincing, pragmatism, offers an unequalled voice of reason in the dark forest of relativsm where American thought languishes. <br /> <br />Given the timing of \\"What's So Great..\\", it's important that a work like this comes to us courtesy of a recent immigrant.  There's a perspective here impossible to duplicate among our nation's coddled natural born citizenry, many of whom condemn their native land as they would a resented parent who's spoiled them into impossible expectations.  D'Souza brings none of this baggage to his work.  He's grateful and proud to be a US citizen without feeling any need to disrespect his culture of birth.  He's just seen the superiority of life here, the energy, the possibilties. <br /> <br />In his chapter \\"Becoming American\\", he lays out the central and simple idea that life in America is rich and bountiful not because the streets are paved with gold, but because people are allowed to create their own individuality here as they can nowhere else in the world.   Accountant, Bohemian, novelist, politician, internet entrepreneur, painter...the choice here is infinite, and it is yours.  The individual is the starting point of everything in American society.  <br /> <br />This message has a ringing authenticity from someone who hails from a world where fate is prescribed, religion and God dominate, and individual initiative is spurned and in many cases squashed.  There's no smugness in D'Souza's message.  He articulates the hopes of immigrants to this nation for four centuries.  And as uplifting as his analysis is, it's equally unsettling in its assessment of world hatred and resentment.  <br /> <br />He draws the conclusion that history will ensure that right will prevail, and that America is nothing less than the beacon on the hill for a benighted world.  His voice is consonant with the neo-conservatives and their doctrine of spreading peace and prosperity through democracy.  But his tone is more modulated than theirs, reminding us of the intensity of the enemy's determination, and warning that, however worthwhile and necessary, the struggle towards a liberal world society will require all the force of unified will the nation can muster.	2005-02-24

Be it tax cuts, education reform, the war on terrorism, or privatizing social security, the president has evidenced an acute awareness of the power of words to sell his agenda, an ironic intuition from someone so vilified for the verbal gaffes that pepper his speeches.  Perhaps overcompensation for his oracular shortcomings led him to cultivate sharp, articulate people like Karen Hughes. <br /> <br />Hughes has had few rivals for George Bush's ear from the moment she joined the staff of his campaign for governor in 1994, following stints as a journalist and Texas Republican party operative.  The affinity between the two is easy to see, as Hughes'accounts of some amusing but trenchant exchanges bear witness. \\"George W. laughed at my exuberance,\\" Hughes recounts in the early days of the first gubernatorial campaign.  \\"'You love everything,' he told me once.  'You love spring, you love fall, you love summer, you love winter, you love the beach, you love the small towns, you love the mountains..'\\"  Coming from an action oriented optimist of the first order, this was high praise indeed.  And, as it turned out, a shrewd evaluation of someone who soon turned positive thinking into electoral victories.  <br /> <br />Hughes was born an army brat, and recounts her early years with fondness, giving credit to her parents' mixture of affection and discipline for the value system that drives her own ambition.  After some peripatetic years which saw the family through stints in Europe, the US and Central America, the Parfitts settled in Texas, and Karen began to fuse an innate passion for <br />words with a growing interest in conservative ideology.   <br /> <br />Her love for language suffuses these memoirs, and seems as genuine as her affection for her erstwhile boss.  It's clear that her abilityto frame a message with words chosen for economy and eloquence played a crucial role in driving public opinion toward George W., removing the stigma of lightweight attached to his name and draping him with the mantle of neo-conservative visionary.  The man we now know as W, number 43, comes to us courtesy of Karen Hughes and Co.   <br /> <br />The author herself comes across as a likeable if somewhat exhausting type, energized by conflict and driven by a constant need to set the record straight.  She has an acute sense of the rightness and superiority of the policies she and her boss are prescribing for the nation, and she presents them in this book with the same winning assurance that brought her such triumph on the campaign trail.  She has faith in few things--God, country, family, and the power of words, not necessarily in that order.  She telegraphs the feeling that, with your heart and your words in the right place, there's no mountain that can't be moved. <br /> <br />One has to feel a little for her husband, though her treatment of him here is filled with respectful admiration.  A single father and practicing attorney when he met Karen Parfitt, Jerry Hughes already had a failed marriage behind him and a daughter to raise when he met the driven young campaign worker.  He probably had no idea exactly what he was in for when they married in the mid 80s, and the success of their union is due in no small part, and by Karen Hughes own admission, to Mr. Hughes' ability to subsume his own needs and interests to that of his spouse.   <br /> <br />All this fusion of the political and the personal makes for a great story, and Karen Hughes tells it well, and with characteristic focus and clarity.  The irony, then, is that it's her main message, and the theme of her autobiography overall, that's the hardest to buy.  According to her well known story herfamily's life,particularly that of her teenage son, suffered immeasurable upheaval by the move to DC to join Bush's administration in 2001.  All through the early days of legislative acitivism and the horrors of 9/11, she maintains, her family suffered in silence because of her need to discharge her duty to the President and the nation.  At some point, the conflict became untenable, and she made the only choice that a wife and mother with conservative values could possibly make.  She gave it up, pulled up stakes, and moved home to Texas for the sake of her son.  <br /> <br />But wait a minute.  Hughes herself was an army brat, who managed to deal with the separations and disruptions that result from following a parents' career.  To her credit she never once evinces bitterness about these experiences, and even embraces them as stimulating and formative.  Why shouldn't she expect the same thing from her own son?  After all, she wasn't moving the family to take a promotion to product manager for Colgate in Cleveland.  She was working for the President of the United States, and was offering her child a once in a lifetime experience to live and learn at the highest level of American society.  Couldn't he deal with e-mailing his friends in Texas while he attended a posh private school in an exciting city and watched his mother make history?  Even after all Karen Hughes' tortured explications for her decision, this reader still came away skeptical that this was the whole story.  <br /> <br />But regardless of one's read on her motivations, Karen Hughes' story is a timely and resonant one in modern American life.  She emerges as a post-feminist archetype, rejecting any kind of self-definition through victimhood.  Now that her son is a big boy of 18, it remains to be seen what inevitable, meaniningful role she'll carve out for herself next from the sharp rocks of American political life.	2005-02-22

Writers have struggled to make sense of this tortured relationship since the beginning of literature. Lesser authors might shy away from attempts to tread the same hallowed ground explored by titans like Hemingway, Steinbeck or Faulkner.  But Anthony Doerr, in \\"The Shell Collector,\\" succeeds on his own quiet and gentle merits in portraying the pathos of human beings separated from their natural selves by the forces of civilization.   <br /> <br />By and large each story here is a gem, revolving around a central, singular, simple character with a magical nature.  In the title story, a blind recluse in the south seas becomes an unlikely and reluctant healing guru by way of a heretofore venemous shellfish. Doerr renders the man's heartache with graceful, stunning empathy as his life careens away from him, and then circles around and back, a necessary cycle of pain and redemption. <br /> <br />The rest of the book opens up the themes introduced with such loving artistry in the first story.  \\"The Hunter's Wife\\" and \\"Mkondo\\" both weave tales about women separated by marriage from their true selves like Persephone from Demeter, living with men whose love they accept, but live to regret.  In \\"Mkondo\\", the bride, removed from her home in sub-Sarahan Africa, laments of her new environment:  \\"Nothing grew, nothing lived; even the light seemed dead, falling from naked bulbs screwed into the ceiling.\\"  From her musings Doerr evokes the vision of a vibrant, colorful plant dessicating under false sunlight. <br /> <br />The most powerful and and haunting story of the collection is \\"The Caretaker.\\"  A refugee from the Liberian civil war loses his mother and his way of life, washes up on the shores of Oregon, and carves out a new existence for himself on the inhospitable grounds of a software mogul's estate. Broken, haunted by the violent real-life nightmares that drove him from his home, Joseph Saleeby seeks solace in hiding, tending a garden fertilized by the gargantuan remains of a beached whale.  His sense of life comes back to dazzling color as the garden germinates: \\"By mid June the stems of his plants are inches high..the buds have separated into delicate flowers; what loooked like a solid green shoot was actually a tightly folded blossom.  He feels like shouting with joy\\". But there's another encounter in store for Joseph, one that will bring him yet again into a denatured world where he must prove his mettle. <br /> <br />Two of the stories--\\"For a Long Time This Was Griselda's Story\\" and \\"July 4th\\"--are a little less accessible than the others, though no reader will soon forget the unique talents of the metal eater in \\"For a Long Time...\\"  \\"July 4th\\" seems more derivative than the others.  It recounts the misadventures of a group of Americans as they search for the best fishing venue in Eastern Europe.  Sound like a lost generation, anyone? <br /> <br />But these are quibbles.  Even the weaker stories teach important lessons.  The price of renouncing our natures is a high one, the author seems to say.  But it may be inevitable in the course of human life, and it may even purchase a round trip ticket right back to where we belong.  And the journey, for all its pain and trauma, can be magical.	2004-12-30

Could it be that our political system is constructed with a built in propensity to waste our hard earned dollars?  That Capitol Hill is rife with venal, ruthless opportunists whose care and feeding of the special interest beasts ensures that most worthy citizens remain locked out of the Federal castle like so many vassals in servitude?  That it doesn't matter which party prevails, the spending party never stops?  <br /> <br />Sadly, yes to all three, according to Joe Scarborough in his recent Washington expose \\"Rome Wasn't Burned in a Day\\".  As one of the maverick Republicans who stormed Congress in 1994 with an aggressive agenda or welfare reform, tax and spending cuts, and general accountability, he's in a position to know.  It's tough in there, he tells his dismayed readership, sprinkling the narrative of his experience with anecdotes about Congressional waste and corruption as amusing as they are alarming.   <br /> <br />Here are some of the specifics: %500K for swine waste management, $175K to study desert plants, 5M for \\"at risk\\" fisherman.  And there are more.  And these, moreover, emanating from that same Republican Congress who rode in ten years ago to save the day from such folly.  Power corrupts, Scarborough shows us, as we take a trip with him through the looking glass during his tenure in Congress.  Through internecine squabbles, floor battles, and nasty personal piques, we see how the Republican liberators have emerged as the new tyrants, complete with uassailable House seats and enabled by a pliant Republican president. <br /> <br />Ah, the pity of it.  Unfortunately, none of it is really news, and the fate of the Republican mavericks could have been foretold from the outset.  They did accomplish some real change before they flared out, but Scarborough lingers mostly on their failures, all the time minimizing his own role in their downfall.  And he did play one.   <br /> <br />He presents himself as the prototypical Mr. Smith, tough and unflappable in defending the basic limited government principles he believes in.  But Mr. Scarborough must be savvy enough to know that politics is a war game, that he played the game in a certain way, won a few battles, and lost his right flank.  This is life.  But things will go on without him. The war for basic libertarian priniciples did not end with the goverment shutdown in 1995 and the mutiny against Newt Gingrich.  <br /> <br />The book has a lot of strengths--its down home writing style, simple presentation of the complex nuances of the political game, and Joe Scarborough's own compelling story of triumph and disillusionment.  The problem is that Scarborough seems more interested in blaming everyone for the state of the system now rather than looking forward to new possibilities.  Terms limits, campaign finance reform, more disclosure--his remedial suggestions seem like an afterthought, old and moldy reform concepts that either haven't been tried or haven't worked.  Scarborough insists, over and over, that he quit Congress in order to be a better father.  Perhpas.  But it seems likely that he, like any number of clever operators in Congress, knew how to cut and run when the running was good.	2004-11-05

The worst that can be said of his character in \\"Gould's Book of Fish\\" is that he makes a habit of living on the wrong side of fate.  From his random and illegitimate birth to an Irish maid and a Jewish laborer in the early 19th century, through his routine incarcerations for the most ridiculous non-offenses, he stands as a symbol the pain, brutality and aching beauty of his times. <br /> <br />From the book's outset there's a sense of evanescent, transformative magic amid the menace of William Gould's life. <br />He speaks to the reader first through the ministrations of a devoted, twentieth century seeker of beauty, who finds Gould's original autobiography, a collection of obsessive scribblings and startling icthyological illustrations, stuck in the prison of an antique chest in a junk shop.  When the book is mysteriously lost, its bereft and obsessed owner sets out to recreate the work with the extra authenticity of a disciple's devotion. <br /> <br />So this is a book about a book.  And from the outset, Flanagan's writing makes it a triumph of revelation and humanity.  This is no small task, considering that the bulk of William Buelow Gould's star crossed existence takes place on Sarah Island, Tasmania's own answer to the Devil's Island of Papillon fame.  The startling, eloquent language Flanagan employs to outline the savagery of this most infernal place is one of the book's many strengths.  It has all the elegance and eloquence of the language of its times while retaining a sense of intimacy and immediacy.   <br /> <br />William Buelow Gould's life a riot of debacles that go well beyond Rabelaisian levels of debasement.  His tormentors include the colony's Commandant, who, under an assumed identity, sets out to create a Potemkin village of European enlightenment amidst the insanity of his own being and environs; the physican, who meets with a undignified gustatory end at the hands of hismonstrous pet pig; and the guard, with whose corpse, through a series of bizarre and surreal events, he shares a cell that fills with water at the coming of the high tide.   <br /> <br />Taken under the wing of the physician, Gould's artistic talents are put to work in the service of a primitive form of eugenics.  He's commissioned to create a book of fish to rival the one of birds by the celebrated Audubon, the better to raise the esteem of the physician among the men of science towering over the enlightment at home.  Through his compliance, Gould finds a way to transform himself, and his world, in a way that defies all the evil that humans can foment.   <br /> <br />The only logical conclusion that the reader can draw in this supremely surreal novel is that there is no art, or life, without suffering.  Few literary characters have suffered as much for art as William Buelow Gould.  And fewer modern authors have created an historical novel with so much mystery, color, and wisdom.	2004-10-08
US	52172461	R28AEI164FU5L7	0812968468	320164530	The Russia Hand: A Memoir of Presidential Diplomacy	Books	4	10	11	N	Y	Subtle Diplomacy	The devil is in the details, but the \\"angels\\" call the shots (and in this story the \\"angels\\" are no angels).  This is the short version of Strobe Talbott's exhaustive, intimate memoir of the transformation of US-Russian relations during the tumultuous 1990s.  Bereft of the old adversarial structures of the cold war, and lacking any type of transitional plan, the diplomatic establishments of Washington and Moscow were compelled to feel their way through a stubborn morass of suspicion and ignorance and emerge with something like a policy of institutionalized cooperation. <br /> <br />By this account and many others it was a tough row to hoe.  The meat of the book covers the period of Clinton/Yeltsin diplomacy between 1992 and 2000, a time when the Russian nation was reeling from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the social upheaval brought on by free market economic \\"shock treatment.\\"  National pride had suffered a series of body blows as the Soviet Empire fell apart and lost its coveted place as the \\"other\\" major power on the international stage.   <br /> <br />In 1992, while publicly basking in cold war \\"victory\\", the US political establishment was inwardly wringing its hands over how to handle its volatile, battered, erstwhile enemy.  Internally in Russia political wars continued to rage among nationalists, communists, and liberal market reformers, and it was nowhere near apparent that the nation might not suffer a political hijacking or economic meltdown which would lead the nation back down a path of despotism and isolation.  This was a moment of limitless opportunity and unfathomable risk for the US and the world.  The stakes were huge, and the outcome unknowable.   <br /> <br />Enter the diplomats.  Under the direction and tutelage of Mr. Talbott in this country and Yuri Mamedov in Russia, the two little armies of bureaucrats started the decade long brainstorm over nuclear arms, NATO enlargement, the worrying linkages between Russia and Iran, the dispositionof Soviet era debt, and myriad other potentially explosive issues. It was no easy business, and progress was halting. <br /> <br />Time and again Talbott's team ran into roadblocks and obfuscation from their Russian counterparts. Some of it was related to the long Russian predisosition to hiding behind opaque bureaucacry;  some had more to do with national pride.  Most often, though, US Russian progress was stymied by forces inside the Russian establishment with a vested interest in arresting diplomatic progress where it took hold. <br /> <br />Bill Clinton understood all this.  And more importantly, he understood Boris Yeltsin.  More than once Talbott invokes the importance of the personal relationship between the two men, both by turns rogues, charmers, and vulgarians, with a singular optimism and clarity of vision both for their respective nations and for the future of world security.  With some funny and incisive anecdotes Talbott demonstrates again and again the power of the personal in the political process, as Clinton and Yeltsin transcend the turf wars going on among their minions below to hammer out compromises and agreements that start to assume real political and economic coherence.   <br /> <br />Not that there weren't bumps along the way.  Yeltsin, though Talbott declines a formal diagnoses, comes across as a classic manic depressive, high energy and visionary when his back is to the wall, despondent and alcoholic when he feels his enemies smothering him.  Clinton, though keenly attuned to the constraints on his counterpart from the factional strife in the Russian military and the obstreperous Duma, had his hands full when Yeltsin came to the bargaining table in a blustery or drunken temper.  Talbott is masterful in recounting the tensions in these encounters, especially in Helsinki in the early part of the adminstration. <br /> <br />In the end, this is the story of two flawed, great men who left their world a better place for having worked together.Talbott leaves no doubt that all the rest, the quibbling and arguing and messy details of diplomacy, were inconsenquential in the face Clinton and Yeltsin's determination to not just preside over the death of an old era but to define a new one.  It's somewhat poignant to go back to the beginning of the book, when Clinton, in the twilight of his term, meets the rising star Putin for the first time and senses a new, more stringent and controlled era settling over the Russian nation and the face it shows the world.  There's just no chemistry between the bumptious American and the cautious new leader.  Talbott leads us to believe that it wasn't just chemistry, but a genuine personal friendship that put the final stake in the heart of the cold war and all the bad that came of it.	2004-09-01
US	52172461	R2D6XM04UEDXO4	006095521X	630596025	Paradise Alley: A Novel	Books	4	7	7	N	Y	Nasty, Brutish, and Long	Welcome to Kevin Baker's New York.  By 1863 the great metropolis had grown into a cruelly concentrated reflection of the greater nation, offering countless lives the tantalizing prospect of a lift from danger to hope, squalor to prosperity, and slavery to freedom.  But 1863 was a singular time in the city's life, as in the country's, a time when the fragile fabric of civilization fell victim to a reckless, violent drive for freedom and survival. <br />It's evident that Kevin Baker has a complicated relationship with New York. His main characters, by turns noble, desperate,<BR>resourceful, feckless, and downright evil, all share a seminal drive for survival that propel them through impossible traumas and betrayals.  From Ruth, the Irish peasant girl who runs from starvation in her homeland and washes up on American shores,  to her frightening co-hort and erstwhile mate Dangerous Johnny Dolan, to her great love the ex-slave Billy Dove, her sister-inlaw Deirdre, and the cynical journalist Herbert Willis Robinson, each soul has a relationship with the city that either saves or destroys.  And in New York, survival is not always the province of the good.<br />Yet through this scrim of ruthlessness the author's affection for the city still shines through.  His style of writing, though often subdued and painful, somehow gives voice to the intense possibility of the place. The crucible for his characters' lives, the draft riots of 1863, crack New York wide open and unleash a torrent of horrific violence.  Yet by novel's end, despite some of the tragic and unresolved circumstances of the main characters, there's a sense of purging and redemption.  The war, the riots, and all the hardships that came before all teach something about the need to strive for good.<br />Historically Baker seems on firm ground with his subject matter, though a lay person might wonder about the author's take on race and repression.  In particular, to an uninformed mind the development of the relationship between Billy Dove, the ex-slave, and Ruth, the Irish refugee with a scary and violent boyfriend, seems florid and far-fetched, a bit like &quot;Mandingo&quot; written as Harlequin romance.  During these passages Baker loses control, falling back on a style less assured and honest than that displayed througout the rest of the book. It's an uncomfortable passage to read--a little embarassing, like a wrong note passed off as a right one in an otherwise flawless concerto. <br />Some of the book's peripheral stories (i.e. those outside the city's vise) are gripping.  Ruth's almost random flight from her starving family's home, her journey through the hell of Ireland's starving countryside, the harrowing journey across the Atlantic in a typhus infested ship with the psychotic, near dead Johnny Dolan--these are some of the most powerful passages in the whole work.  This reader has never come in such intimate contact with the carnage and horror of that time. Billy Dove's escape up the East Coast on a makeshift sailboat, pursued by slave traders and sharks, also show Baker at his page-turning best. <br />This book is a labor of love, and love is a complicated thing.  Baker brings to it effective writerly instincts, a strong sense of character, and an clear desire to make history live.  If it's a long book, it needs to be so.  Baker has much to say, and he says it well, leaving the reader enriched, informed, and thoroughly entertained.	2004-06-11
US	52172461	R14VVZTWX3KOIP	1591840082	853464652	Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron	Books	4	120	129	N	N	Not For Lay People	There's blame galore to go around for the spectacular downfall of Enron Corp in that sober year of 2001.  Accountants, rating agencies, regulators, lawyers, consultants, bankers--and these are just the bad actors outside the corporation.  Look inside, where Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind treat their readers to a thorough journalistic scouring, and the smell of the rot almost wafts off the pages. <br />The authors rightly spend the vast majority of the book examining the personalities and circumstances that allowed the company to become what it was at the end of its life.  Mix a potion that's one part hardscrabble Harvard MBAs, one part energy deregulation, and one part hysterical bull market, and you've got a financial molotov cocktail.  Sadly, as we all know now, it was largely the little guy who paid the price for all the hubris of the players in this story, a fact that tends to get lost in the authors' painstaking recreation of the most complicated shell game in history.<br />But the story of Enron's fallout could provide the material for a whole other book.  In this one we get the tale of the players, people like Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Rebecca Mark and Andy Fastow, all filled with an equal mix of remarkable brilliance and fatal arrogance.  All are indicted by these authors as rabid players in a game they made up themselves, deeming themselves beyond the petty world of rules and regulation.  But coming in for equal excoriation is the system itself, the web of enablement and intimidation that allowed Andy Fastow to quietly hammer together the company's coffin in the form of a maze of phantom accounting entities designed to prop of the appearance of the corpse inside.  The most unnerving theme the book treats indirectly is the effect of mass psychology--the way exceptional personalities distort and transform reality on a systemic scale.  And it offers little in the way of how something like this could ever be prevented in the future.<br />One word of warning forpeople not acquainted with basic finance:  this is a complicated story, about erstwhile geniuses in the arcane use of financial products and regulatory loopholes.  Though it's enjoyable even if one can't follow every detour down each accounting scheme, some knowledge of Wall Street and its workings seems necessary to understand the implications of the book overall.  Given the fact that most experts didn't understand what went on here, the authors do their best to keep things as simple as possible, often using helpful metaphors and simple summations after a few pages of analysis, but they have no choice but to assume a level of sophistication among their readers.<br />Which leads to one gripe.  In &quot;The Smartest Guys In the Room&quot; not a single institution or individual player involved with Enron escapes the authors' finger-pointing notice, with but one exception.  Where were the journalists in all this?  Why did short-sellers have to be the ones to ask all the tough questions?  Bethany Mclean should take understandable pride in being the first one to pry the door open on Enron's malfeasance, but she was just a little late.  One would think that with the mass of financial journalists on CNBC, the Journal, the Times, etc., that just one would have bucked the collective cheering squad and dug deeper into what this supposedly invincible company was up to.  But of course, this was the bull market.  A time when everyone was exuberant when they should have been scared.	2004-03-26

It has all the right elements: historical sweep, operatic drama, and deeply realized characters moving in prominent family constellations.  But though the work would find a comfortable spot in Alistair Cook's revered collection, perhpaps right next to &quot;The Flame Trees of Thikka,&quot; in the loving hands of its author it soars beyond any hint of cliche. It's a unique and memorable novel that transcends its genre to challenge not only the intellect, but the imagination as well.<br />Beginning in Burma during the British invasion of 1885, &quot;The Glass Palace&quot; tells the story of many empires.  The death of one gives rise to another throughout the book, always with life-altering results for the main characters and earth-shattering consequences for the world.  At the outset we meet Rajkumar, an eleven year old ethnic Indian orphan caught up by sheer happenstance in the usurpation of the Burmese King Thebaw by his British &quot;protectors&quot;. As the events unfold and sear themselves on Rajkumar's psyche, he gleans a sense of a world filled with danger for the ignorant and reward for the insightful.  As the royal couple and their retinue, including Rajkumar's secret love Dolly, leave for exile in India, Rajkumar embarks on a journey filled with wild success, hidden passion, and a tragic finale made bearable only by the fact that he has survived and is not alone.<br />It's Rajkumar's adventures that set the stage for the rest of the novel, though he fades out as a main character about half-way through the book.  His progeny and those of his friends and colleagues take center stage after Rajkumar has put in place a multi-million dollar teak conglomerate and rendered his family independent.  But his struggles,and those of everyone in his orbit, continue through all the wrenching and violent disturbances of the twentieth century, culminating in the devastating Japanese attack on Burma in December 1941.<br />Empires rise up, consume, and recede over and over again in &quot;The Glass Palace&quot;.  For the most part this process spells death, displacement and heartache for those caught up in its vortex.  But redemption here, as in many great works of fiction, comes through the bonds formed by people under the most hopeless of circumstances.

Consigned to paralyzed existences, they struggle like flies on paper for some kind of end to the drudgery of menial jobs, empty marriages, and overdue bills.  If there's nobility in their treadmill exertions, it never shines through.  The only relief for the pitiable characters in Richard Russo's epic portrayal of life and death in a dying factory town lies in drink, memory, and the vain hope of escape to anywhere else. <br />Like most of his compatriots in &quot;Empire Falls,&quot; Miles Roby was born to his lot.  But unlike them, someone dreamed for him.  His mother Grace, a beautiful vision of his youth, stood guard over him like an angel, toiling in a factory and an abusive marriage, all to ensure that her beloved Miles realized the station in the world that his mind and soul deserved.  But what neither Grace, nor Miles, nor anyone in Empire Falls could realize, was that their lives and futures were already decided, because they were owned by a force they couldn't comprehend or fight, but only fear.<br />Francine Whiting is a villainess right out of TS Eliot or Ken Kesey, a cunning and ruthless virago with an insatiable appetite for control.  Having long ago married into Empire Falls' founding family, and emerged through widowhood and shrewd manipulation into literal ownership of the town, she plays with her feeble-willed subjects like a cruel puppeteer, offering up empty hopes and false promises for better lives, all the while sucking the last vestiges of value from the dying town.<br />Armed with two strong and warring main characters, Francine and Miles, Russo weaves a tale of compelling mysteries and betrayals, augmented by a style of writing that evokes pain and nobility in plain spoken but elegant prose.  Like eddies in the town's polluted main river, sub-plots swirl and dissipate, sucked into the main whirlpool of the titanic struggle among Francine, Miles, and those in their orbit to rationalize and conquer the secrets of the past. <br />Russo has firm control of his story.  His skills as a writer prevent the sometimes pulpy material from descending into outright soap opera.  He uses the clever Dickensian tool of leading the reader into the lives of the poor through the eyes of the rich, and proceeds to offer up a compelling, though often frustrating and depressing, tale of struggle and salvation,<BR>culminating in the hard-- won but tentative triumph of the human spirit. He style is that of the old-fashioned novelist--no abstractions or experimentations here--but his use of a conventional literary construction still has the stamp of originality and significance.  The worst that can be said of it can be said of the work is that it's about sad people, and is best read during a contemplative afternoon alone on a rainy, dreary day.	2003-12-30

Tom Seymour, the protaganist of Pat Barker's nuanced novel &quot;Border Crossing&quot; is a renowned psychologist with a failing marriage whose past comes back to him when he rescues a former patient from a possible suicide attempt.  But even as he drags the young man half-dead from the ocean, the questions bubble to the surface.  Was this a chance meeting?  Or had the patient, whom Tom had treated a decade before as part of the legal team prosecuting a young boy for a brutal murder, come back into his life with some kind of sinister purpose?<br />Answers are elusive as the Tom relives his past, and examines his own culpability in the unravelling of the boy's life.  His search for the truth about Danny, a boy who grew to manhood with the shadow of a murder conviction over his head, plays out over the backdrop of Tom's divorce and the questioning of many of the fundamental beliefs of his life. The facts he uncovers, and those he doesn't, give him insight into his own life that seems more necessary than welcome.<br />If mysteries are the most compelling stories, and people the most complex mysteries, than Pat Barker has created a small masterpiece here.  The author puts forward Tom's frustration and obsession with subtle skill, as the puzzle of Danny's persona eludes a solution like a Rubik's cube.  Each approach to the truth thwarted starts Tom down a different road, one with new, and possibly more dangerous, consequences.  <br />For such a small book there's much substance here.  The writing is gentle and accessible, evenly paced, graced with subtle and thoughtful innuendo.  Barker gives us just enough about Danny in the end, not to think we've answered every question, but to imagine we're asking the right ones.	2003-10-03

For readers interested in religion, history, art, philosophy, Ottoman culture, politics, romance, sex, and murder, and how all these forces interact to form human experience, this book delivers. Set in Instanbul in the 16th century, a time when the tenets of early Islam were under assault from creeping Western culture, it resonates with all the tension that results when change threatens faith. <br />At its core, \\"My Name is Red\\" is a murder mystery.  A gifted miniaturist, in the midst of a working on a book for the sultan glorifying his reign, is murdered and thrown down the well.  His only offense is that he's discarded the ancient prohibition against figurative drawing, falling in line with modern European dicates about art and the human form.<br />From there the book branches out like the tree of life. Often the question of who murdered poor Elegant Effendi is lost in the oceans of debate, philosophy and speculation over God, art, love and honor.  Dialoguess and monologues go on for pages and pages of dense, tortured argument.  This is not an easy book to take to the beach and expect to be carried along by brisk and engrossing narrative.  If your taste ranges more toward Kant, Hegel, St. Thomas Aquinas and Bernard Berenson and less toward Agatha Christie, you'll find this book a delight.<br />Of course, it's enlivened every hundred pages or so by the romance between Black and Shekure, the tortured cousins who've loved and lusted after each other for a dozen years, always in the shadow of his art and indecision.  Their interaction provides just enough sexual tension and even steaminess to counteract the relentless thought discipline of the rest of the book.  If you find yourself skipping pages to catch up with Black and Shekure's assignations, you'll miss everything the book strives for. But for most humans the temptation will be strong. <br />If you open your eyes to the book's points about color, blindness, and the power of sight, you'll glean much from the experience.  But don't expect an easy time of it. Sadly, it seems most people can't really see what this noble work wants them to.	2003-07-18

Bush, An Inside Account	Books	3	15	20	N	N	Bush's de Bergerac	For an author with such inside advantage, David Frum recounts his time as a speechwriter in the Bush administration with surprising journalistic detachment.  This might be admirable if it weren't so frustrating.  While Frum tells his story with straightforward professionalism and provides an adequate study of a president in progress, the whole project seems sanitized.  Frum must know more than he lets on, if his prowess as a speechwriter is any indicator of his political savvy.  He could have, and should have, risked giving his readers a little more than they might have experienced in any campaign-era article in \\"The New Republic\\".<br />As it is, Frum offers the usual portrait of \\"Dubya\\" as Henry IV--a man from political royalty, footloose and reckless in his youth, comes to terms with both adulthood and his manifest destiny as author and steward of a new brand of American conservatism. His vision squares the American ideal of individual primacy with the notion of a social responsibility bequeathed by divine fiat. By force of his decency and sheer will he shapes the debate over taxation and the nature of government in our lives for years to come.  He opens the floodgates for real educational reform.  And, most importantly by far, he leads the country through one of its most traumatic historical moments on 9/11 and into a new era of world historical dominance, where the evangelical religion of peace through strength, democracy and liberal free markets holds sway. <br />It's a great story, but it's nothing we haven't heard before.  Even when Frum tries to mix things up by detailing a few internecine squabbles among cabinet members his dispassionate recounting seems third hand and wan.  He's very careful not to step on toes or burn bridges. <br />That goes both for his former Big Boss and for all the prominent adminstration players he rubbed shoulders with.  In Frum's rendering they all seem, literally, like church board members--political but righteous, honorable anddecent throughout.  All very much in the image of their grounded, focused, plain-speaking, honest boss.<br />Somehow it stretches credulity, even for those who admire the tacks the administration has taken on most issues.  The most scandalous issue Frum tackles (and with thinly veiled personal satisfaction) is the revelation that he himself was the author of the famous \\"Axis of Evil\\" phrase in Bush's speech to the joint session of Congress.  There must be something else festering under skin in the West Wing.  We'll hear about it someday.  But certainly not from David Frum.	2003-05-17

If you believe your tastes are too pedestrian for the gourmet literary feast served up by Jim Crace in \\"The Devil's Larder\\", think again. These tiny tales of human beings and their gustatory obsessions contain the full spectrum of flavors for gourmand and epicure alike. <br />It's this accessibility that makes Crace one of the most evocative writers of short fiction working today. While it may seem a highbrow undertaking to prepare sixty four miniature stories about food and serve them as a meal, the book never exudes an air of snobbery or literary exclusiveness.  Food, in Crace's rendering, is the most democratizing element in the world, through which people and their secrets can be rolled back like a slowly opening can of sardines.<br />The stories' brevity is their most astonishing strength.  With words sprinkled with loving artistry over the pages like ingredients in a souffle, each tale evokes a passion, a pain, a longing, a regret, which many novelists fail to capture in work thousands of times as long. And, while of course each story stands on its own, the thematic integrity of the work makes it feel like a complete five course feast, disguised as a banquet of delectable one-bite hors-d'oeuvres. <br />What is an aubergine? A rose hip? A cheroot?  The author might not expect his readers to know, but to imagine.  And it's in daring us to imagine that Crace, a master-chef of the English language, leaves us with a greater sense of who we are and what we might become.	2003-04-27

While the travails of the Hanoverian King George III are well-documented, there were other psychiatrically afflicted monarchs who, whether due to some unfortunate gene or to the infectious subversion of enlightenment philosophy, injected the politics of their courts with the logic of madness. One such monarch was Christian VII of Denmark.<br />Per Olav Enguist's historical novel documents a turbulent period in Danish history, a time when medeival institutions bumped up against modern free-thinking with transformative, and sometimes explosive, results.  It's a well-crafted work, laying out the history with insight and clarity, all the while painting complex and realistic characters in shades of grey.  The book chronicles the rise of the royal physician Struensee, a disciple of the enlightenment who finds himself, through almost random selection, at the center of Denmark's political maelstrom. Though his ultimate demise is revealed at the outset, Struensee's journey through the looking glass at the Danish court, and the price he pays for his part in bringing the world to enlightenment, make for an engrossing read.<br />Central to Struensee's tenure as the main adviser to Christian VII was his affair with Christian's queen, Caroline Mathilde of England.  This unfortunate consort could never seem to escape from the madness of either her times or her family.  She was the sister of George the III, and her marriage to Christian, which involved one conjugal experience and one baby, never rose above the infantile level at which the Danish king could operate.<br />At times sensual and desperate, at others filled with the weight of impossible expectations and hopeless risks, the story of Struensee and his increasingly forceful paramour spills off the pages of the book with resigned determination.  Struensee uses his time in power to rewrite Denmark's social code, infuriating the powers ofcourt, and makes himself, through his passion for justice and for Queen Caroline, an easier and easier target for destruction.<br />Enquist's style is somber and instructive, his language plain but filled with complexity.  He makes people and events come alive with spare sentences that speak volumes about the inevitability of freedom and the costs in imposes. As for the nature of logic, insanity, and the sanctity of free throught, he leaves the reader to draw his own conclusion.	2003-03-04
US	52172461	R32FCVDMELNG0B	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	3	2	4	N	N	The View from Up There	It's hard to imagine that even the most hard-boiled aheists among us don't wonder what heaven might be like.  For Susie Salmon, the protagonist of Alice Sebold's highly acclaimed new novel \\"The Lovely Bones\\", it's a celestial observatory, a minimalist place where simple wish fulfillment allows a young girl to see up close the anguish and passion of the loved ones she's left behind. Given the nature of her death, raped and dismembered at thirteen, the peace Susie feels, even while her family and friends grapple with the horror, is a sweet relief for the reader.<br />It's an irresistible premise, and Sebold goes a long way toward effective development.  The murder occurs near the beginning of the book, and its description is chilling in its simplicity.  Evil lives in a hole in the ground in a cornfield, surrounded by the simple people of a small,non-descript Pennsylvania town.  Sebold's boldest character development occurs during the opening chapters, when we meet Susie and her murderer, Mr. Harvey.  We see things up close and events are so matter of fact that the full horror of things isn't brought to bear until a dog retrieves Susie's elbow from the fields.<br />From here the book loses altitude a bit, becoming more family drama in attitude--Dad breaks down somewhat, though his crystalline grief allows him to correctly identify the murderer from the outset; mother has an affair, grandmother comes to town with an irritating penchant for tippling and telling.<br />All this happens while a bemused Susie watches from above and displays all the posthumous wisdom a thirteen year old can muster about love, evil and redemption.  Here's where writing can either sink or save a novel, and in Sebold's case it does a little of both.  Sometimes Susie's commentary, and her sister's and friends' earthly struggles with ghosts and the truth, do seem haunting and other-worldly.  Other times they degenerate into a variation of \\"Hey, God, It's Me, Margaret.\\"<br />Given the context of the novel it makes for a schizophrenic experience.  At once \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Judy Blume\\", the story lurches a bit thematically and fails to fixate on the most interesting aspects of the characters it develops.  The introduction of some minor characters, all wrestling with the cruelty of death and the long-suffering fate of the creative soul, does more to dilute than stregthen the narrative.<br />With such intense critical acclaim, it's easy to expect a masterpiece.  But this isn't one.  It's engrossing at times, disappointing at others, but ultimately doesn't rise to the heavenly heights to which it aspires.	2003-01-23

And he single-handedly muscled the U.S. Senate into passing the first piece of civil rights legislation since reconstruction. The paradox that was Lyndon Johnson receives microscopic examination in this third installment of Robert Caro's ambitious biography. It's a story that needs a thousand pages to recount how a political phenomenon horsewhipped the Senate during the twelve years he spent there and drove much of the dramatic history that predestined his presidency. <br />Caro inevitably expends most of his scholarly focus on the struggle for the 1957 civil rights bill, a weak piece of legislation that pried open the seal of Senate reluctance to shake of the legacy of reconstruction eighty years before. Prior to his struggle to pass the bill Johnson had never been noted as a champion of liberal causes--his loyalty, such as it was, rested firmly with the Southern senators who counted him a star among them. But Johnson had extraordinary powers of perception, and even, Caro suggests with a few telling anecdotes, a streak of humanistic compassion. He soon sensed that a wave was breaking in American life, and he had every intention of riding it to glory.<br />The Senate was Johnson's natural habitat--\\"just the right size\\", he declared when he arrived there in 1948 fresh off a stolen election. Clubby, fraternal, and exclusive, the institution had done more to block progressive legislation for decades than all the raft of bigoted southern governors combined. Dominated by the aged and formidable southern bulls, it sat there, impenetrable and determined, resisting all change and miring the nation down in moral and political inertia.<br />Caro sets all this up with masterful journalistic thoroughness, so that by the time Johnson walks through the Senate's venerable doors the reader senses right off that the antiquarian legislators were welcoming a serpent in their bosom. Johnson's personal style shook things up from the start, as he took measure of the Senate's power centers and plotted his way toward ultimate control. In 1948 none of his colleagues would have predicted the ultimate ascent of this Texas hayseed, with his backslapping, vulgar ways, though some took early note of the folksy way he never stopped cajoling and persuading until his interlocuter was completely won over to his point of view. <br />For years in the beginning, Johnson gave no sign of his ultimate destiny as shepherd of the civil rights movement. Caro rightly makes no attempt to sugar coat Johnson's ruthless side. The book lingers provcatively over the Leland Olds affair, when Johnson sacrificed the career and reputation of a highly regarded left wing bureaucrat in order to gain political capital with the oil lobby. During this reprensible episode Johnson wears the face of Joe McCarthy to devastating and unremorseful effect.<br />No question, Caro seems to say, the man wasn't perfect. Colorful, forceful, and American original, he was all of these things and more. And probably, the book hints, at the end of the day, when the masks were off and the truth revealed, the level of his humanity and heroism were able to shine through his Machiavellian armor.	2002-12-16

Set in Sri Lanka during the late 1980s, &quot;Anil's Ghost&quot; brings poetic fictional graces to the horrific civil war which plagued the country through most of the decade.  Centered on the search of its central heroine, a forensic anthropologist, for the hideous facts hidden in the skeletons of her native country's citizenry, the book gently probes for the source of all the malevolence.  Ultimately, though, reality in these circumstances is elusive, and ghosts are the most tangible witnesses to the truth.<br />At its core &quot;Anil's Ghost&quot; is a search for identity.  The title character's mission takes her back to a past and culture she had long since jettisoned, but still carries around like a <BR>millstone.  Anil is testimony to the emotional perils of a globalized world.  Drawn by the seductive lures of the west, she lives for years studying and exploring in Europe and the midwest before embarking on her quixotic quest for justice in her native land.  She never has both feet comfortably in one place, and her love for her country is always ambivalent at best.<br />Back at home her journey becomes ever more personal.  In the company of several colleagues from her past, who force to relive painful family truths, she fixates on one discarded skeleton, &quot;Sailor&quot;.  In a clear metaphor for her own search for herself, she applies all her formidable forensic skills to uncovering the secrets of one dead man's life.  In so doing, she seems to think, all the collective deceptions of her life and her country will be laid bare.<br />Ondaatje's style is passionate in a restrained and lyrical way, making the book seem at times like a chronicle of a dream.  Many of the anecdotes are disconnected, and it's a bit hard to latch on to the characters in a concrete way.  None of them, or much else in the book, seem very real.  They're all like ghosts, and it's hard to know who or what to trust.  <br />Butthe author's command of language makes the novel brim with yearning and possibility.  The story drips with tropical languor mixed with a vague, omnipresent menace.  And it's made more disturbing that the enemies here, both in the mind and outside, are never really visible.	2002-07-23

The struggle between the advocates of centralized economic control and those of market fundamentalism has underpinned every geo-political event since the 19th century.  Recently, with the fall of Soviet Communism and the discrediting of socialist regimes worldwide, the concensus has built that the march of free markets is both inevitable and desirable.  But Brink Lindsey, in this remarkably thoughtful and shaded analysis of globalization and its discontents, argues effectively that the struggle continues;  the seductive inertia of central planning dies very hard in a culturally and economically disparate world.<br />Most surprisingly Lindsey reveals himself to be anything but an idealogue.  Though his thinking emerges from the premise that competition and free markets provide the best promise for growing worldwide prosperity and general human advancement(he is, after all, a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute), &quot;Against the Dead Hand&quot; argues forcefully for a strong government role in economic affairs.  While paying all due respect to the venerable Mr. Reagan and other free-market icons, he offers the view that government itself is not the problem.  Specifically, government interference in the functioning of capital markets is the problem.<br />Societies find trouble, Lindsey argues with forceful anecdotal evidence, when governments over-regulate, over-tax, impose trade sanctions like import quotas and subisidies, institute price controls, nationalize industries, any activity which distorts the market price mechanism.  In one of the book's most interesting early chapters he discusses how decisions are made in human interaction, and how those decisions are signalled throughout large populations.   In short, he makes a compelling case that the market mechanism works best in situations in which economic knowledge is limited.  In these cases the sum of all economic decisions will provide optimum solutions.  In situations where the production mechanisms and outcomes are known, centralized planning works best.<br />The world we need to strive for, according to Lindsey, is one in which free markets can flourish in an environment in which civil and property rights are fiercely protected by a democratic government.  Government's role is no more and no less than to provide the ground rules for playing the free market game.  But without such a framework, the game can't be played with any economic relevance.<br />In the course of his analysis Lindsey draws on empirical evidence spanning the past two centuries, and looks in on every corner of the globe.  He exmamines economic development (and regression) in the former communist bloc, the Asian tigers, Latin America, and of course that imperfect ideal, the United States.  He never misses an opportunity to pound the table for free trade, and argues that the dead hand of government (i.e., protectionism) is the very thing impeding the economic progress of the developing nations anti-globalists claim to be protecting.<br />There's one area of murkiness, and perhaps it's only because it veers away from the always involving story of evolving world economic experience.  In his discussion of where the ideas of market fundamentalism and centralization emerged from, he sometimes grabs conclusions out of the air.  When times are unstable, he says, people harken back to the past, and hence when industrialisation happened, society collectively decided to find safety in a new form of feudalism (i.e., socialism)  Maybe, but it's just conjecture.  Didn't events influence things more than collective thinking?  Do people really think en masse in defiance of all things practical?<br />But as a whole the book is a noble attempt to piece together the myriad pieces of the global historical economic puzzle.  Lindsey's conclusions on society's fate are tentative but hopeful.  And his ideas are a search for the best in humanity.	2002-07-11
US	52172461	R2BWR6L9IO9SMF	015601064X	279597616	Six Figures	Books	3	3	5	N	N	The Have-Nots	He's no Tom Wolfe, but Fred Leebron offers some astute social commentary in his novel &quot;Six Figures&quot;.  It's a sullen and frustrating book, but nonetheless engrossing, and edged with a few keen observations about the nature of humans in the clutch of terminal prosperity.  It works as a chronicle of a certain place and time--in the this case, Charlotte, North Carolina during the height of the internet gold rush--but it remains questionable whether its premises have relevance outside of this narrow literary theater.<br />Warner Lutz is an unpleasant fellow from the start, though he often manages to make the reader feel as sorry for him as he does for himself.  Wracked by feelings of inadequacy and yearning for the trappings of the good life he sees in abundance all around him, he labors in his chosen field, not-for-profit, with increasing amounts of ambivalence and bitterness.  Leebron is at his best when chronicling the suffocating day to day survival struggles of Warner and his wife Megan.  Wave after wave of minutiae--diaper changes, feedings, car repairs, air-conditioner breakdowns--keeps crashing down on them with such relentless regularity that drowning seems inevitable.<br />And something like that happens.  Megan is found in the art gallery where she works, unconscious from a series of vicious hammer blows.  Warner is the chief suspect. The drama that unfolds forces an examination of three families and the hidden guilts which have corroded them from the inside for decades.<br />The story resolves itself satisfactorily, though not drawing real conclusions about Warner's hopes for redemption or happiness.  The &quot;did-he-do-it&quot; aspect of the story is hardly the stuff of Agatha Christie, but that's probably not the point.  In the end we see that sometimes people need a crucible, some event or revelation, to make them see what was in front of their faces all along.	2002-04-02

Each day on the trading floor, as computers blinked and eager brokers barked into the phone, bright young people yielded to siren call of greed.  Personal destruction was the goal of the game, as Darwinism ran rampant and the strong metaphorically devoured the weak as a matter of course.<br />Somehow Lewis avoids turning this often disturbing display of human baseness into a morality play.  His sense of humor is most likely what allowed to him survive, and even succeed, during his time in the lion's den.  In \\"Liar's Poker\\", he uses it to great effect, painting vivid portraits of the colorfully flawed egoists who drove the bond market into excess and chaos.  For all their blustering, Lewis reveals many of the redoubtable players in the bond game to be sad and insecure, and avoids the temptation to pass judgement on them.<br />It's no wonder that Lewis finally answered his calling in journalism, because he displays amazing skill here, and not only as a writer and observer of the human condition.  He's equally adept at ferreting out facts, analyzing them, and presenting them to lay readers in an entirely comprehensible way.  In the course of his rollicking story, he manages to deliver a pretty detailed lesson on the basics of finance, the bond market, and the ways it impacts our daily lives.<br />As a neophyte himself when he went into investment banking, Lewis seems to tutor the reader even as he's learning some of the basics himself.  He explains how the bond market drama of the eighties began with the adoption of a new operating system by the fed, targeting money supply growth instead of interest rates. This caused bond prices to swing wildly and created a window of opportunity for traders in the heretofore backwater bond market to reap huge sums in arbitrage. At the same time, consumer and government debt skyrocketed, creating a enormous demand for fixed income products.  <br />Many of the big shots, \\"or \\"Big Swinging...\\", as Lewis often<BR>refers to them, happened to be in the right place at the right time.  Luck definitely played a large part in making many of them legends.  As for Lewis himself, he emerges as one of the luckiest of all, escaping with a rich experience, the material for a terrific book, and maybe even his soul.	2002-03-22
US	52172461	R2VZXK3XB4SFX0	0471208884	381868632	Bloomberg by Bloomberg	Books	4	39	43	N	N	Mr. Big	Don't be deceived by the modest size of this self-made billionaire's autobiography.  As if cramped by the limitations of the book's length, Michael Bloomberg's ego assaults the reader like an over-zealous vacuum cleaner salesman, pushing his ideas on life, work and excellence with all the energy that scores of superlatives can summon.  Funny, then, that in many places the story comes off as a crashing bore.<br />&quot;Bloomberg by Bloomberg&quot; is ultimately redeemed by the compelling nature of the tale.  More than anything the spectacular success of Bloomberg, L.P. highlighted the extent of the information technology revolution and the resultant productivity gains that transformed global industry.  There's no question that Michael Bloomberg saw these changes coming, and in harnessing them created a company whose reputation for excellence, innovation, and customer orientation set a standard unmatched by any information services company before or since.<br />The author's pride in Bloomberg, L.P. suffuses the book, and he focuses so much loving attention on its birth and propsperity that at times this seems more like the story of a company than a man.  The two are clearly of one soul. But at times it's easy to forget that this is the story of an extraordinary character and not an addendum to &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot;.<br />This life story is one in which the input of outsiders would add tremendous insight.  When Bloomberg discusses his dealings with his Harvard Business classmates, his trading buddies at Salomon Bros., or his employees at Bloomberg, it's easy to wish for their side of the story.  As it is, the only hint we get of humility or insecurity from Bloomberg himself is his incessant reminder of the fact that he had been fired from Salomon Bros. (&quot;though with a $10million severance), and that he had to call on every psychological resource to overcome this calamitous setback and move on to greater glory.  Is he difficult?  Has he ever been ruthless or cruel?  Does he have any imperfections at all?  You won't learn these things from Bloomberg by Bloomberg.  And what he possibly doesn't realize is that these are the things that add color to a story, if not authority in the boardroom.  Next time he should shop for a biographer.  Maybe after he's moved on from the mayoralty to the Big Job, Doris Kearns Goodwin can do him justice.	2002-02-21

Value America was the brainchild of Craig Winn, one of those American original megalomaniacs intent on changing the world.  A manufacturer's rep with a volatile record of success, Winn was an early convert to the web, sensing its potential to transform the retailing landscape and revolutionize the way goods are bought, sold and distributed.<br />With the charisma of a born-again preacher Winn converted the non-believers, recruiting some close associates to set up a shoestring operation in Charlottesville Va.  The story of Value America's birth mirrors that of so many start ups of the time, with employees whipping themselves into a working frenzy over the promise of stock option riches.  But at Value America, as David Kuo so skillfully tells the tale, it wasn't just greed that drove the converts on to their perceived glorious destiny. More than anything, it was the overpowering and mesmerizing personality of Craig Winn himself.<br />Kuo does a neat job of setting the story up with the blow by blow accounts of which relationships led to which rounds of financing, and how Winn found his way, through ingenuity and old-fashioned salesmanship, into the top echelons of the new economy elite.  One has the sense that the author wished he'd been there during those heady early days.  By his own account he certainly had no idea what he was in for when he came aboard in 1999 as Value America's VP of Public Relations from his background in politics and non-profit.<br />By then the received wisdom was that Value America was on its way to greatness.  Already the much awaited IPO had gone through, mega-deals with Fed Ex and Citigroup loomed just over the horizon, and Value America's office campus and fleet of jets were on order.  Kuo bought into Craig Winn's world with the fervor of a new disciple.  His worship of the great leader comes through again and again, even as Winn evades, misleads, and outright lies when dealing with Wall St., the public, and his own oh-so-cherished employees.<br />Of course, it all ends badly, but with oddly few recriminations.  Everyone involved in the drama at Value America comes away with the notion that they have participated in something big, if not exactly real.  The only players in the drama who seem to have walked away completely unscathed were, interestingly, the religious leaders like Jerry Fallwell and Ralph Reed, whom Winn recruited to give credibility to his demi-god status and bankability to his quixotic mission to run for president.<br />It's all very confusing how rational people end up as raving fantasists at the hands of a snake oil charmer. The most nerve wracking aspect of the tale is the huge scale of deception that swirled among the large group of ostensibly savvy people.  Kuo does an admirable job of shedding light on the story, at the end equating his own fate as that of a Yukon goldminer who, lucky to have survived the harsh Arctic winter, has emerged broke but alive to tell the tale.	2002-01-08
US	52172461	RXTB2384R10Q0	0743205626	833686522	Maestro: Greenspan's Fed and the American Boom (Greenspan, Alan)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	The Rating Game	With the same dogged thoroughness he used to blow the   Watergate conspiracy wide open, Bob Woodward debunks the inner workings both of the mind of Alan Greenspan and of the labyrinthine workings of the institution he's come to embody. Over the past fifteen years the management of monetary policy has emerged from the shadows of secrecy to become a spectator sport in America.  In &quot;Maestro&quot; Woodward brings us through this process step by step, all the while painting a many-shaded portrait of the man who brought it all about.<br />Greenspan emerges in this chronicle as a benign dictator disguised as a skilled concensus builder.  Supremely confident  in his interpretation of economic events, from the inception of his tenure he handled the Board of Governors with deft political skills, listening to everyone while pushing his agenda forward with ruthless determination.  Assuming the post right before the stock market crash of 1987, he has pushed a consistent policy of fighting inflation and pounding the table for debt reduction.  The most fascinating and confounding part of his job, figuring out how productivity gains have altered received wisdom on inflation and employment, remains the key to his legacy today. <br />Woodward provides a great rundown of how politics rule in this quintessentially &quot;apolitical&quot; institution.  Greenspan's relationships with Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton twist and turn with the political exigencies of the time--elections, wars, scandals.  It's ironic that Clinton emerges as his hands-down favorite, given his understanding of the role of debt reduction in lowering long-term interest rates.  Greenspan, a long-time Ayn Randian libertarian with a Republican affiliation, never felt that the Republican incumbents had any intuitive grasp of what mattered economically for the country beyond election time.<br />Anyone who thinks they knew a lot about the Greenspan years will know better after they read this book. The story continues, with an afterword in the paperback edition about the present recession and war on terrorism.  Greenspan seems far from finished with his mission, so perhaps Woodward will owe him a sequel in a few years.	2001-12-14

James Boswell, a high-born and well-connected Scot with a taste for the dissolute life, found vicarious greatness through the famous man of letters Samuel Johnson.  Their friendship became a crucible for the development of modern biography.<br />Adam Sisman does a great job of setting out the irony of his story.  Boswell, thirty years Johnson's junior, scorned by his own father, plagued by manic depression, and given to bouts of drunkeness and venereal disease, was never taken seriously by most of the high born men of letters and law he cultivated.  Viewed largely as a fop and a dilettante, he often seemed lost in life, hardly the kind of person to walk on the same hallowed ground as the great Samuel Johnson.<br />Sisman delicately explores the attraction Johnson had for Boswell, indicating that the younger man's insatiable curiosity and lust for life plugged holes in Johnson's thinking and brought relief to his often sour and querulous view of humanity. Perhaps he also felt a sense of destiny Boswell.  Only one genius can recognize another.<br />Whatever the case, Sisman's book is a greatly entertaining laboratory for dissecting two intense personalities who raised each other into the pantheon of literary history.  It's filled with pathos, jealousy, lust, ambition, disappointment and ecstasy, all the elements that make up a rich life.  It's fascinating to see the how the legacy of the Boswell papers played out over the course of centuries as they migrated through the Boswell family, locked away in different chests and vaults, leaking out bit by bit into the hands of ecstatic scholars.  <BR>To this day, it seems, elements of the Boswell canon are still being discovered.  Undoubtedly the process will continue, and Sisman's book is a worthy record of the ongoing story.	2001-12-13

Katharine Graham, late publisher and CEO of the Washington Post Company, recounts her extraordinary experiences with disarming and self-effacing charm.  Born into a world of wealth and power, dominated first by formidable parents and then by a charismatic husband tormented by the demon of manic depression, she came into herself in middle age as she struggled to lead her family's company through some of the most turbulent and fascinating times in the country's history. Katharine Graham emerges as both a product and a reflection of those times.<br />Many have defined her as a pioneering feminist, and that she was, though she came into feminist consciousness with tentative baby steps well into her tenure as a pioneering CEO of a major corporation.  But feminism never defined Katharine Graham.  In many ways she defined it as she reinvented herself again and again.  In the process she came to understand the low grade oppression women suffer in even the most progressive society, but her raised consciousness was only one facet of her lifelong education.<br />Her transformation from oppressed wife to CEO is a thrilling one, though it's the only part of the book that seems just a little disingenuous.  Graham presents herself as a naif, unschooled in the way of boardrooms and balance sheets, as if she were called into the cockpit to fly a 747 before taking any flying lessons.  The reality seems to be that the whole first part of her life, filled though it was the perquisites of a high born society matron and CEO's wife, was in fact a long preparation for her ultimate destiny as the leader of a venerable publication.<br />Even if Katharine Graham inherited the paper as a birthright, her handling of her role was nothing less than heroic at times.  Shepherding the paper through the 60's and 70's, and the upheavals of Vietnam, Watergate, and the labor unrest at the Washington Post itself, she made decisions on epic matters which were usually correct and always reponsible.  At the end of her tenure, with a little help from her friend Warren Buffett, the paper had rewarded its patient stockholders with a runup undreamed of when she started.<br />Among the book's many admirable qualities is Ms. Graham's writing style.  It's straightforward and honest without betraying a hint of sanctimoniousness.  From her rarefied position she brings the reader up to her level without patronizing.  The way she tells her story, the thing that emerges from underneath all the power, glory, wealth, and adventure is one woman's class and decency.	2001-10-17

Born of an ignorant caucasian wanderer and an Indian girl barely out of her teens, he belongs nowhere, is loved by noone, and stands as a mute indictment of a world filled with hypocrisy, brutality, and despair.  There's something about Edgar, though, which enables him to give and receive redemption all throughout his life. He cannot, will not die. His is a life filled with resurrections.<br />   They occur with alarming regularity.  In the opening pages of Barry Udall's remarkable new novel, six-year-old Edgar has his head run over in an accident with a mail truck.  Surviving this catastrophe through the ministrations of a darkly obsessive doctor, Edgar spends his formative years in the warm coccoon of a hospital ward, the hellish confines of a boarding school for Indian children, and finally on the periphery of a well-meaning but troubled Mormon family.  <br />     Barry Udall guides us through thirty years of Edgar Mint's life and leaves us wanting more.  The Dickensian plot twists and resolutions underline Edgar's superhuman resiliency, as well as his heartbreaking vulnerability.  It's impossible not to love this kid, and to want to be the one who makes everything OK. There are several blanks to fill in in Edgar Mint's life, in time and space.

US	52172461	R2VUHNII0EEN5V	0399147454	559108275	The Muse Asylum	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Diagnosis: Genius	What is it about reclusive authors that inspire literary-minded people to such heights of obsession that they lose all sense of the impossible? Do they imagine that the JD Salingers and Richard Brautigans of the world have broken free from all the mundane demands of reality, existing on a plane far above the mere human, pondering the truth from the Olympic heights of genius? Might they know the truth about everything that we are? Or are they just frightened? Perhaps they're frauds, as fallible as the Wizard of Oz struggling behind his curtain. Perhaps they're not who they say they are at all. Maybe they're alien space creatures in disguise, come to open the way to celestial invasion. The possibilities are endless.<br /> Daniel Czuchlewski has written a first novel that explores these mysteries with a unique combination of urbane style and clever playfulness. Three of his main characters, Jake Burnett, Andrew Wallace, and Lara Knowles, are Princeton-polished children of the privilegentsia, filled with innocent notions of truth and beauty, striving for a toe-hold in the real world while casting wistful glances back at the illusory one of their youth. The fourth is an author whose writings have drawn each of them into a world they have an increasingly hard time escaping.<br /> Horace Jacob Little is a literary pied piper, a genius, whose absence from the physical world has created a black hole which sucks in those who live for the tantalizing insights in his books and short stories. During college, Czuchlewski's three protagonists introduce each other to the lore of Horace Jacob Little. His ideas about identity, and humanity, speak to each of their lives in a unique way, but Andrew becomes convinced that Horace Jacob Little is his personal muse and nemesis. His life revolves more and more around the premise that Horace Jacob Little knows who he is, and can't tolerate his existence in the same world.<br /> The story revolves around Andrew's questionable sanity, Jake's journalistic probe into the reality of Horace Jacob Little, and the love the two young men share for the heroine, Lara Knowles. The plot is filled with the cleverest twists and turns, and the characters evolve, ever so subtly, from Whit Stillman clones into multi-faceted, thoughtful young people, empty vessels who become richer, and stronger, after being filled with the sometimes bitter exlir of experience. <br /> There is a fifth main character in the book, too--the Muse Asylum itself, inspired no doubt from the McClean Institute in Pennsylvania. The Muse Asylum, a sanitarium for artists, is a repository of gentleness and humanity, a place where genius finds refuge and snuggles up comfortably with insanity, where no judgements are allowed. But is it really? As Andrew Wallace's struggle with his arch-enemy Horace Jacob Little unfolds amid the gracious interiors of the old mansion in upstate New York, the truth seems to have lots of colorful facets.<br /> This is a superb first novel, a tight story graced with a rare stylistic elegance, filled with many more questions than answers. One suspects that Czuchlewski is no stranger to obsession, or at least compulsion--on the book jacket it mentions that he's attending med school in New York even as he works on his second novel. Maybe the second novel will delve into the mysteries and secrets in the life of a prodigy.	2001-07-17
US	52172461	RF9U2XKLPRY0W	0380726289	380093282	Darkness, Take My Hand: A Novel (Patrick Kenzie/Angela Gennaro Novels)	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	The Tangled Web	Throw on your trenchcoat, suspend your disbelief and go along for a thrilling ride through a world of untold evil and unexpected redemption, courtesy of Dennis Lehane  and his terminally romantically thwarted duo of private eyes, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro.  Boston is plagued by yet another series of brutal serial killings, but the modus operendi this time is crucifixion, not strangulation, and the victims seem random.  But are they?  When Angie and Patrick find themselves investigating a threat against the son of an old client, they find that there may be more commonality lurking among the fiend's victims than meets the private eye. <br />     The tale unfolds through a series of horrific events, the ruminations and reminiscences of scores of unforgettable characters, and a jailhouse interview with the face of evil itself.  The book is peppered with hard boiled detective speak straight out of Elmore Leonard, updated with references to &quot;N'Sync&quot; and Bill Clinton.  The language is one of the many fun parts of the read, but it's the characters, and the age-old unfolding struggle between good and evil within each of them, that really give it merit.<br />     A couple of drawbacks:  the book is like a maze.  It takes the concentration of Bobby Fischer, or at least a very elaborate flow chart, to keep all the characters and their histories and interrelationships straight.  A lot of the violence and grotesquerie is gratuitous and a little insulting to the intelligence of the reader, as if he needs every salacious detail of disembowlment and dismemberment to keep him awake enough to wade through the plot's complexity.  Nonetheless, don't take it too seriously, don't struggle overmuch with the minutiae, and the unique honesty of Lehane's prose, even while shamelessly derivative, will get under your skin.	2001-07-09

In his book &quot;How I Accidentally Joined the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy (and Found Inner Peace) the author and journalist chronicles his quintessential boomeresque journey from affluent red-diaper baby to responsible guardian of values, decency, and above all, family.          His is a cautionary tale of disillusionment, realization, and self-actualization as only a prominent member of the ultimate &quot;me&quot; generation could relate. Troubled by the early sordid revelations of the Clinton campaign in 1992, Stein methodically unravelled years of liberal conditioning in his own mind, questioning orthodoxies and voicing heresies which earned him the contempt of unreconstructed leftists everywhere.<br />     For those readers looking for support for their own political conversions, this is a valuable book.  Stein gets it right, in more ways than one, on many of the issues, tackling the mindless hysteria of extreme radical feminism, the pernicious effects of the entitlement culture, the suffocating despotism of political correctness, and the general decline of moral decency in American life.<br />     It's often the right message, but it's the wrong messenger.  Stein's arrogance permeates all of his political analysis, as he adopts one form of self-aggrandizing righteousness for another.  The story of his metamorphosis begins, where else, with paeans to the transformative power of fatherhood.  It provides the basis of his renunciation of feminism, his indictment of the media, and his fierce enmity towards the liberal intelligentsia, whose putative &quot;good intentions&quot; he learns to despise and then to suspect at their core. <br />     His shameless diatribe about the pro-choice movement, which he equates with the moral rot at the center of leftism everywhere, gets thrown into stark relief when he admits that he himself was responsible for three abortions, one in his callow youth, and the others, somewhat shockingly, with his wife, with whom he now shares two children.  He sheepishly admits to his hypocrisy, then blithely skips on to his favorite subject, the joys of parenthood.  His narcissism knows no bounds.<br />     He ends the book on a sour note, detailing the marital woes of an acquaintance who'd abrogated his family responsibilites and had an affair, all under the approving guidance of a therapist.  He then goes on to admit to using therapy himself, revealing what we didn't want to know about his own volatile marriage, and patting himself on the back for staying in the relationship for the sake of the children.  &quot;My wife can be very hateful sometimes,&quot; he states with assurance.  One wonders what his wife might say of him.<br />     These impromptu confessions spoil an otherwise cogent and timely indictment of a culture mired down in self-indulgence and lacking a spiritual core.  Harry Stein thinks he's escaped the clutches of this many-armed monster.  He might want to go back into therapy.	2001-06-14
US	52172461	R39PFO5UC965V9	1555534813	158108461	The Long Prison Journey of Leslie van Houten: Life Beyond the Cult (Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and Law)	Books	3	62	71	N	Y	Crime and Punishment	Writing a biography of a personal friend must be a very tricky business.  Karlene Faith met famous Manson murderess Leslie Van Houten almost thirty years ago, and has proven an effective advocate for her eventual release.  The relationship  between the teacher and the reformed cult member is touching and very real, but it undermines this book as a chronicle of a criminal's transformation from delusional disciple to remorseful, decent soul.<br />  Rather than focus on Van Houten's thoughts and feelings during her three decades behind bars, Faith uses the book as an apologia and rationalization for the prisoner's choices and behavior when a very young woman.  The author seems to have only a vague realization of the monstrousness of the crimes committed, and lays the blame squarely on the mastermind, exonerating her subject and casting her as a victim in the same mold as those who lost their lives.  Van Houten herself seems to have a clearer view of her own culpability, and it would have been interesting to hear more about this from her own mouth.<br />  The book does cast a disturbing light on the inequity and gross politicization of the justice system.  Van Houten's crimes, and her admitted participation in them, should allow for the imposition of a true life term, and so far the system seems intent on doing so.  It's shocking to read, then, that all of the other prisoners on death row with Van Houten when the death penalty was suspended were released from prison within a few years.  It seems that when no one is watching, the justice system plays by some very inept and unfair rules.  Certainly Van Houten poses no further threat to society, while the prison system routinely ejects predators with murderous histories and no sign of reformation.<br />  Though thick with pages full of psychobabble and research into cult psychology, there are enough anecdotes in the book to humanize the subject and make it an interesting read.  Van Houten does come across as an obvious candidate for legitimate parole.  But Karelene Faith's blind approach to this polarizing subject may be the last thing Van Houten needs.	2001-05-31

Elder's ten taboos of political correctness translate into a latter day gospel of individual morality filtering down to one golden rule: thou shalt take responsibility for thyself.<br />  The book takes on all comers:  welfare cheats, criminals, teenage mothers, youth gangs, the AFL-CIO, Medicare, the liberally biased media, and the two party system.  It is the &quot;victicrats&quot;, those well-meaning operatives of the American left, who occupy the lowest rung in Elder's pantheon of oppressors.  From Hillary Clinton to Ted Kennedy, Alton Maddox to Maxine Waters, Elder deconstructs motive and policy to reveal how society's most prominent &quot;leaders&quot; conspire, accidentally or not, in holding citizenry down in a mire of self pity and entitlement.<br />  The book starts out with an indictment of black &quot;leadership&quot; and attitudes, and the first chapters are a clarion call for self-respect and personal responsibility.  Elder topples a lot of totems in the first pages,but much old ground is trodden when he examines the pernicious effects of AFDC on the black (don't tell Elder to use &quot;African-American&quot;) family.  The revelations of the moral bankruptcy of Al Sharpton aren't exactly a transformative experience, either.<br />  Later, when he delves into a more wide ranging discussion of Libertarianism and its implications, things really get interesting.  He offers a trenchant examination of the US health care system, the most understandable that this reader has ever encountered.  The chapter on the war on drugs could convert Nancy Reagan to the cause.  Gun control advocates have never had such an effective foe.<br />  The greatest weaknesses in the book come when Elder is at his most self-serving.  He gives a weak argument for why he benefitedfrom affirmative action while he would deny it to others.  His indictment of the media includes such specious claims as the one that &quot;they know nothing about the laws of economics.&quot;  Since he's now a prominent member of the media, he would do well to back up such statements with at least some evidence.<br />  In the vast majority of the book, Elder uses statistics and anecdotal evidence to devasting effect.  If for this reason only, he needs to apply this technique more evenly throughout this interesting work.  Even with such weaknesses,  Larry Elder has shown us the way on a journey to a greater humanity, and for that he deserves our rapt attention.	2001-05-30

Despite the title, many of the stories have no canine characters.  All of them, however, play on the themes that grow from man's relationship with his favorite pet.  Pride, devotion, fidelity, death--all the emotions that come to light through man's bond with dog--are intimately woven together to create tales of honest humanity.<br />Some of the stories resonate enough to recall Faulkner, in particular &quot;A Bad Man So Pretty&quot;, about a hardscrabble delinquent and his long-suffering brother. &quot;Tenant&quot; is another story dripping with southern nostalgia for the nobility and grandeur of times past.  <br />A couple of the stories, while interesting, seem misplaced in this collection. &quot;Amelia Earhardt's Coat&quot;, about a little girl's encounter with the famous aviatrix while growing up in the social heights of Rye, New York, seems more suited to a John Cheever collection.  Others, like &quot;Sundays&quot; and &quot;Poker&quot;, don't rise to the quality of the rest--they seem like practice runs, sophomoric and self-conscious.<br />Ultimately the stories' strength rests in the complexity and colors of its many memorable characters.  While the collection overall is uneven and the writing sometimes underdeveloped, the people in the stories become outrageous stories themselves.	2001-05-11

For them, death is a slimy process, a story unto itself, narrated in brutally clinical detail by Jim Crace in his startling exploration of man's relationship with fate and nature.<br />   Relaxing in undignified nakedness, Joseph and Celice are set upon by a stranger with a brick, their heads squashed into pulp, their limbs intertwined in a final demonstration of devotion.  The novel circles around this central event, always returning to the repulsive but thoroughly involving process of human decay.  We learn that Joseph and Celice are zoologists, an unattractive, harmless, innocuous couple who have ridden through life with few expectations and a strong sense of industry.  If they have a passion, it is for their shared interest in the workings of nature.<br />    Joseph and Celice have some colleagues, few friends, and a daughter dealing with the bitter fruit of a disappointed youth.  For her unhappiness, she blames her parents.<br />    But for the random and violent nature of their deaths, Joseph and Celice would have passed through time into obsolescence and natural mortality with barely a whimper.  But death is their story.  Through it, they demonstrate real truths about the human condition, its relationship with nature and its cycles, and how endings inspire beginnings.<br />    In its way, the book reassures us of the beauty of process, and how each stage and level of life feeds into the others.  In a way Jim and Celice's ending makes perfect sense for them.  In death they become a metphor for all the possibilities and tragedies of life.<br />    One warning: this book is filled with descriptions of bodily rot, decay and consumption.  Oddly, though, this provides a vehicle for Crace's abundant talent for creating magic through words.  The author renders disgusting things beautiful, describing death as have the smell of&quot;burnt marmalade,&quot; speaking of how &quot;thanks to the ruptured chemistry of her cortex, (Celice) hurtled to the stars&quot;.  In his rendering of the entire experience, Crace creates chinks in the armor of the human dread of death, providing enlightenment and reassurance in one brief and intense book.	2001-05-02

A couple struggling with the death of their baby, a man painting his way out of the drudgery of his misspent life and into the melancholoy colors of old age, a young man intent on gaining fame through the sensational act of smashing through plate glass--these small stories are rendered large through gentle ironies woven into elegant prose.<br />    This collection could easily fall into common trap of hackneyed, pointless introspection, but it doesn't.  Each story is far too clever, well-crafted, and even funny.  In their own way each is wrapped in a veneer of hope, possibility, or at least, dignity.  One of the cleverest of the bunch is &quot;Gryphon&quot;, in which a young boy learns about the world from an eccentric teacher he's not likely to forget soon. &quot;A Late Sunday Afternoon by the Huron&quot; is an intimate pastiche, a beautiful literary take on a famous French painting.  &quot;Stained Glass&quot; spins a familiar tale of love's follies with a delightful twist.<br />Baxter brings the beauty of language and the saving grace of personal affection to his characters.  In a short time they become old acquaintances.  They're people one can continue to learn from the more one thinks.	2001-04-25

There's no doubt that Shreve knows his audience, and that it's a big one. <br />   Gordon Hatch is an earnest, capable young journalist, eager to prove his mettle on that most depressing of beats, the local obituary desk.  As he settles into predictable youthful disillusionment with his lot and his futile efforts to transform it, a proverbial phone call turns his world upside down, and calls him, like a siren, into the dangerous erogenous zones of sex and death.<br />    Alicia Whiting seems lifted directly from the mildewy paperbacks of Ed McBain.  An older woman, beautiful, mysterious, spooky, she takes an instant interest in our hero and the possibility that he might write a story about her dear, recently departed husband.  Since the husband led the most ordinary life of a bank manager and dog breeder until his untimely death of a heart attack, Gordon can't see the point.  But Alicia's whispery insouciance draws him in, as he starts to realize that her appearance in his life might be all the story he needs.<br />    The plot unfolds in the most predictable way, with a couple of side trips through Gordon's abandoned relationship with a childhood sweetheart and his tit-for-tat sparring with his devoted and overbearing Mom.  Shreve's writing is even and light-hearted.  In the hands of a lesser writer the story would seem sophomoric and trite, but Shreve saves the day by never taking himself or his project too seriously.  <br />    If you're a modern young person with a nostalgic yearning for the style of mysteries past, this book is for you.	2001-04-06

They exist to show us the way to greatness, setting the highest new standards for the best things humanity has to offer.  In their own lives they demonstrate how one person can make a difference in the world through courage, persistence, ethics, and compassion.<br />Debra Dickerson fits every conceivable definition of a hero.  The frustrating thing about her strenuous autobiography, &quot;An American Story,&quot; is that she's a person the reader wants to like, but can't.  Her journey from the hardscrabble life of the working poor through her years as a star at Harvard Law School can hardly be more compelling.  She overcomes the multiple demons of racism, class oppression, family violence and heartbreaking personal insecurity and propels herself through a challenging education, transformative career in the air force, and finally into the highest echelons of America's political and jouralistc elite, all the while gaining new and valuable insights into the intricate interrelationships of politics, economics, race, sex and class.  She emerges as a compelling new voice in the intellectual community as America enters its next stage of social development in the 21st century.<br />The respect she commands for her achievements could never be denied her by anyone.  Yet for all she accomplishes in her remarkable life, the tone of her book resonates with anger, most of it richly justified, and insecurity, all of it rather sad. For all of the thinking she does, from her time as a child petrified by her abusive father through her many misadventures as an ambitious Air Force officer and in law school, she never seems to arrive at the conclusions she wants, and confusion remains with her right until the end.  <br />Teetering back and forth between the politics of personal responsibility and a fuzzy acceptance of the Marxist principles of class obsession, she finds solace one day in the writings of Ayn Rand and decries Ronald Reagan as a &quot;moron&quot; the next.  She bitterly criticizes her own race for half the book for its lack of self actualization, and spends much of the rest of the time trying vainly to figure out what made her think like a traitor.  She decries the pain imposed on her by her often monstrous father, yet follows in his footsteps quite literally in many aspects of her life.<br />The book ends with Dickerson beginning mid-life with a plethora of accomplishments under her belt and a new day dawning.  One hopes that in the volume about the next forty years of her life, which promises to be every bit as interesting as the first, she'll show a side of herself which has learned to mellow with the acceptance of the way things have to be.	2001-03-27

Where life is a series of unconnected thoughts and inconsequential incidents.  Where relationships falter on the twin rocks of ambivalence and depression.  This is the world of Ingo Schulze's Germany circa 1990,a place where confusion is a sure thing, and  people live life in a constant state of low grade psychic hangover.<br />This is a tough book, in every sense of the word.  The language is desultory and barren.  The characters never achieve empathy.  The country remains an unknown place with an tenuous fate even after all the stories unfold.<br />The title of the book is a misnomer.  Nothing about it is simple. The author has laid out a novel in short story form, which adds to the sense of the experience as an incoherent whole.  It's difficult to latch on to the hopes or feelings of any of the characters, since they're so easily lost to the next chapter and the muddy narrative.<br />For a taste of the atmosphere of East Germany in the vise grip of change, the book may have some value.  Mostly, though, it's a cynical trip through a purgatory of boredom.  To the extent that purgatory is a temporary place, the logical outcome would be for these characters to move into a brighter future.  At the end of this book, though, it's hard to be so hopeful.  And it's harder to care.	2001-03-08

For many patients the answer would be straightforward--identify the roots of the suicidal misery, pick them out of the subconscious, force the patient to confront and discard them, and lead him back into the hopeful world of the living.<br />But the peculiarly named Pilgrim presents renowned alienist Carl Jung with some unusual twists which defy a simple diagnosis.  For one thing, Pilgrim has attempted suicide multiple times, seemingly succeeding, only to be involuntarily and inexplicably brought back to life.  He has no history.  Yet he claims to have lived through centuries.  He speaks of Da Vinci, Oscar Wilde and Henry James as though they were his most intimate friends and enemies.<br />The doctors all agree:  a clear case of delusional paranoid schizophrenia.  But as Dr. Jung's professional arrogance is gradually worn away by Pilgrim's extraordinary insights into truth and beauty, the very nature of insanity comes into question.<br />Tim Findley's novel is a rich tapestry of historical fact and literary grace.  Through the story of the time traveller Pilgrim, the reader spends intimate moments with some of history's greatest minds, and learns about the failure of genius to guide the human spirit.  But through Pilgrim the reader retains a faith in the power of beauty to move mountains and achieve the impossible.<br />For any reader who ever questioned accepted orthodoxies about art, history, literature, and the way they have shaped our world, this book is a must.	2001-02-13

It's a risky undertaking, attempting to lift sordid truth into inspiring fiction, but Scribner has firm control over his subjects, and injects his ready made plot with keen insight and incisive social commentary.<br />    &quot;The Good Life&quot; is based on a New Jersey kidnapping case from the 1990s, in which a middle aged couple, in a stunning and tremendously incompetent caper, kidapped a highly placed executive at a Fortune 500 firm.  It was a cautionary tale of the times, pitting the disappointment and rage of those in American society whose dreams far outstripped their talents, against the smugness and arrogance of those the system rewards.<br />     In Scribner's novel, Theo and Coleen Wolkoviak's lives have evolved into a catalogue of failures.  They're unemployed, overdrawn, and living with his father, realizing all the time that they are aging into irrelevance at forty five. The one thing neither of them ever seems short on is fantasy.  They've applied their talent for hyperbole and outright fabrication to a great variety of entreprenurial efforts, all to the end of achieving the things that are owed to them.  What they &quot;deserve.&quot;<br />     Stona Brown is everything they aspire to be.  He has arrived in his career, in his marriage, in his own self image.  His arrogance knows no bounds, and the sureness of his life, wealth and principles is inviolate.  Until one day when his wife spies a strange woman in a pink jogging suit skulking around the foot of the driveway at an odd hour.  The ordeal that follows becomes a battle for Stona Brown's life and soul.<br />     The book is a real page turner.  Some of the characterizations and language seem stilted and unreal, but as the book unfolds it seems that this is a canny calculation on the author's part--his characters are as bankrupt and empty asthe language they think in.  Scribner does a great job of buttressing his social exmamination by adopting a writing style which blends right into the lives and the environments he's describing.<br />     Whether or not a reader is familiar with the case on which &quot;A Good Life&quot; is based, it will leave one with a new sense of what is valuable.	2001-01-22

In his 58 years he rewrote the laws of finance, implemented a new economic structure in Europe, watched his creation transform society, and then looked on helplessly as his brainchild became a monster, failed spectacularly, and dragged his dream and his personal fate into ignominy.  <br />      In between these events, John Law distinguished himself as a young rogue, legendary lover, gambler, duellist and courtier.  Fascinated by the nature of risk at an early age, he saw how, when properly managed, it could liberate an economy and provide the basis of a banking system which had the power to promulgate a prosperity undreamed of by generations past.  <br />      His life reads like the ultimate historical romance.  It's filled with danger, intrigue, lust, and ambition.  In between these adventures the reader is treated to a superb basic education in the history of finance and to the principles which underpin the system of money we take for granted today.  It's a rewarding read which gives a tremendous perspective on human nature and how little it changes with the passage of centuries.	2001-01-17

In one 200 page volume the author takes us from a shipwreck in the Caribbean, to an anarchist convention in Seattle, through the  despotic world of pre-1989 Romania, and onto the battlefields of the Persian Gulf War.  On the way he introduces us to lapsed yuppies, latter day beatnicks, cross-dressing generals and construction executives at war with each other over the meaning of spirituality.  <br />Like any ambitious voyage some of the destinations fascinate while others pale.  &quot;Will You Say Something, M. Eliot?&quot;  &quot;Ceausecu's Cat&quot;, and &quot;A Predictable Nightmare on the Eve of the Stock Market Breaking 6000&quot;, are three of the best ports of call.  They each involve the tragedy of strivers derailed by the cruel nature of their environments.  <br />The weaker stories get bogged down in overdrawn narrative and trivial dialog.  &quot;The Mayor of St. John&quot; and &quot;The Battle of Khafji&quot; are both examples of stories where the author forces us to linger too long over themes he finds interesting.  When Paine becomes overtly political, preaching about the evils of the money system and power politics, he undermines what he does best:  providing skilled guidance through experiences we couldn't hope, or fear, to have otherwise.	2001-01-09

In this third installment Ben has left his family behind, leaving a wake of bitterness, disappointment, and recrimination.    He's found kindness and companionship with an old woman who's taken him in.  But the world never leaves him alone, and his tenuous dual footholds in the realms of humanity and bestiality render him incapable of functioning in either.<br />Ben is a simple soul, with a heartbreaking yearning for human love and affection.  But part of him is not human.  He was born into a human family, raised in human environments, and hungers for human acceptance.  When people see Ben, though, they know he's something else, something apart.  It frightens and fascinates them at the same time.  He has something that people lack, and mostly want--a connection with goodness that comes with honesty.  <br />To help his benefactress Ben ventures into the world in search of money.  His ensuing journey leads him into collusion with low life drug dealers, international film producers, and disingenuous hustlers.  He floats from England to France to South America,  all with the hope finding a home.  Instead he's faced with all the selfish venality that human nature can muster, while he feeds the needs of those who are destroying him.<br />Along the way he sees glimmers of light through keyholes.  He enjoys a startling liaison with a prostitute who so appreciates his bestial sexual style that she pays him.  On his odyssey to South America to make a film about a different race of humans he makes a touching connection with another prostitute who sees redemption in him, and tries to save him.<br />But largely Ben's story is one of betrayal and deceit by those he trusts.  His human side is so beautifully rendered, his physical deformities seem like an afterthought.  But Ben hunts and eats birds and wildlife with his bare hands.  He mates like an animal.  He's a creature filled with honest instinct, and that's what people fear about him the most.	2001-01-02

Looking back from our cynical century, it's easy to regard their greatness as something above the human experience.  In &quot;Founding Brothers&quot;, Joseph Ellis retains all the immense respect due to Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, Hamilton and Burr. But by examining their relationships through a fraternal prism, he renders them three dimensional and accessible to those who long to understand more about exactly what happened during the revolution, and why.      These icons of American independence are wholly human in &quot;Founding Brothers.&quot;  Like brothers in any family, they fight battles of ideas, egos, and principles. But when threatened from without, they come together in a fierce synthesis strong enough to spawn a nation.      Ellis spins his story in a series of vignettes, focusing on very specific moments which changed the nature of the events swirling around them.  He creates an intimacy with his subjects, exploring their psychology, their thought processes, plumbing the origins of their motivations. In the first chapter, for instance, he describes all the various possibilities of what went on during the duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr on the banks of the Hudson in 1804.  By carefully turning over all the possibilities--did Hamilton's gun go off or not, did he intend to strike Burr, did Burr indeed mean to strike Hamilton--he opens the door to an understanding about what each man thought as his boat crossed from Manhattan to New Jersey for the fateful meeting.        The book abounds with intimate anecdotes like this, covering all the well worn subjects of revolutionary history and re-invigorating them with keen insights and intelligent conjecture.  It covers Jefferson's dinner party, the tortured issue of slavery, Washington's farewell address, and the remarkable fifty year asssociation of Adams and Jefferson with affection and elegant style.	2000-12-27
US	52172461	RBA7OMTNSXWDE	0684853523	44310359	On Writing:  A Memoir of the Craft	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Wisdom from a King	For a guy who has scared the daylights out of the reading public for the last twenty five years, Stephen King sure knows how to take the fear out of the art of writing.  With this volume, part biography and part how to manual, he imparts his secrets not just about writing but about living, and doing both with courage and honesty.<br />    The first biographical section is downright hysterical at times, as King describes his hardscrabble youth using anecdotes about his fatally flagellant nanny and his unfortunate accidental use of poison ivy as toilet paper.  He makes the drudgery of lower middle class life sound like kind of a blast, filled with squalid adventures and endowed with the wisdom of the insane characters around him.  At the same the pain of that life comes through the laughter with a poignancy that oozes with truth.  The daily struggles of his mother as a laundress and single mother raising two boys, the petty cruelties of children, the sadism of underpaid doctors--these things hint at why he's so fascinated by the dark, while keeping faith with the light.<br />It's a credit to King's funny, self-effacing style that when he describes his reaction to the life-changing success of his novel &quot;Carrie&quot;, no aspiring writer could ever feel the slightest jelousy or resentment.  It's impossible not to share his thrill, and the delight of the possibilities ahead. King is so generous with his thoughts that we're really taking the ride with him when we read &quot;On Writing&quot;.<br />The instruction part of the book is rife with common sense, specific stylistic guideslines, and some of the funniest bad writing examples to be found anywhere. Some of these are sure to make a writing student cringe at himself, but he'll be laughing too hard to take it too much to heart.  And there are plenty of examples of fine writing on offer as well.<br />Stay concise, don't use adverbs, less is better, read a ton, work hard, be persistent,write with honesty.  These are some of the many golden nuggets any aspiring writer will take away from this book. All of them teach a little something about the best way to live and express yourself, for writer and non-writer alike.	2000-12-13
US	52172461	R2WY7DUF3SAAWR	0312251858	905456201	Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life	Books	4	9	13	N	Y	The Multi Revolutionary	The timing of this thorough, scholarly journey through the life of one of the twentieth century's true world historical figures is unfortunate.  Released in mid 1999, it misses the final, and decidedly pivotal, story of Boris Yeltsin's last months in power, when he finally identified a worthy successor to carry the standard for free markets, democratic process, and rule of law in the erstwhile authoritarian Russian state.  After gamely ushering the reader through the (almost literally)heart-stopping crises and byzantine political intrigues of Yeltin's career, the book ends with the ailing president mired in the financial debacle of 1998, running out of time and options, and forced to play ball with his reactionary Prime Minister.     Luckily we all know how the story played out in the end, with Yeltsin's dramatic New Year's resignation and the ascension of Vladimir Putin to the presidency.  As the reader comes to know Yeltsin in the course of this book, the scope of his political genius and daring reveals itself so plainly and effectively that this reader yearned to know something about why Putin impressed him to the point of bequeathing his legacy to him.     Nonetheless, as a work of history rather than political evaluation, &quot;Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life&quot;, succeeds broadly in demonstrating the varied levels of its subject's titanic efforts to transform a near-death society into something which may well one day become a great nation.       Yeltsin's successes unfold on three levels.  The first, and most central to the book, is the defeat and dismantling of the inhuman Stalinist Soviet society which had strangled Russia for sixty years or more.  This astounding victory set the stage for Yeltsin's assumption of the presidency, after full and free elections, and the various political victories he achieved over the course of his two terms in office.  Finally, and probably most importantly for Russia and the rest of the world, Yeltsin began an irreversible process in this country for the first time in its history: a drive toward private property, free prices, and enterprise which began the nation's slow march into the community of liberal-minded societies.     The book does a fine job of demonstrating the ruthless personal drive which propelled Yeltsin to greatness.  From his early days in the semi-Siberian city of Sverdlosk, when he blew two fingers off his left hand while stealing munitions from a factory on a dare from some teenage friends, the author paints a vivid portrait of a budding iconoclast.  This reader yearned for more about these formative years, but the thinness here is understandable, given the opaque nature of Soviet style historical documentation.  The inner workings of the communist maze confounded Yeltsin as much as is does the reader--it's a truly incomprehensible system, and makes for slow going sometimes as we follow Yeltsin on his journey of discovery. It becomes exciting as his speeches start to reflect his sense of the waste and obscene inhumanity of the entire system.  This reader was looking for that pivotal moment, though, that one or two unique events which crystallized Yeltsin's thinking and made him realize his destiny.  Sadly, those moments are buried as effectively as the system Yeltsin brought down.  This book gives us a great record of the &quot;how&quot; of what happened, but only hints helplessly at the &quot;why&quot;.       All in all, it's an ambitious read, but an informative and thoroughly competent one.  In a way, it makes sense to leave Yeltsin at the end struggling and fighting away against his physical and political decline.  This is the milieu in which he clearly thrived.  Overall victory seemed to soften him.  So, in order to get a sense of the real man, perhaps we have to forgo the happy ending.	2000-10-12
