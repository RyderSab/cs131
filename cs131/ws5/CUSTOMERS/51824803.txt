From the glimpses into the aviation industry, to the relationship Nikki had with Opal--from the old to the new, Robyn Carr covered it!!  Her handling of the 9/11 issue was well done without being maudlin--and without taking political sides.  Her characters are witty, sharp and bright--believable!!  If you want a wonderful read, I highly recommend you grab a copy of Blue Skies!!!	2004-06-02

At the urging of an excellent author, I gave this book another try--I am so glad I did!!  Bound and determined to make it all the way through this time, I found myself unable to put it down--read it in two days and am so thankful I have the next two waiting on my nightstand!!<br />Mr. BeauSeigneur has written a smart, insightful, story of the endtimes that is perfect reading for this time in our nation's history!!	2003-01-30

She writes \\"real\\" and this reader appreciates that--even the best characters in Carr's books have their quirks and idiosyncracies that make them a little less than perfect and in JUST OVER THE MOUNTAIN she triumphs with a mix of the good, the bad and the funny.  Mixed with a little too-good-to-be-true and bittersweet. Warm, wonderful characters in situations that mirror life.  I found myself nodding my head in several spots and my eyes tearing up in others.  Reading aloud the funny parts to my son.  Just what this reader wants in a book!!!<br />I am looking forward to the next book in the Grace Valley series--don't know that I'm going to be able to make it until then!!	2002-09-10

Clea, Rabbit, Ford, Michael, Phinn and Sophie. Nadine and Kyle and Ethan....not to mention, Steve!  (Steve's the dog!)<br />Each of these characters brings their own set of quirks, foibles and idiosyncracies to this story set at The Goodnight Art Gallery in Columbus, Ohio--just a stone's throw away from Crusie's previous setting of Temptation, Ohio.<br />Davy wants his future back.  Tildy wants her past back.  Gwennie would like Aruba and Nadine wants a career choice. Eve thinks she wants Simon and Michael wants to visit his grandchildren--or does he want his daughter to provide him his next stake?<br />Throw all of this into a book, add orange pineapple with a splash of vodka, doughnuts and muffins, not forgetting the 6 Scarlets....and Crusie has brought us one of the cleverest,  light-hearted comedies that is a mystery and a warmhearted romance all in one!!	2002-08-10

Just part of the little details and nuances that Lehane brings to the Kenzie/Gennaro series--and why I keep coming back for more!!  I am attempting to stretch this series out until I hear that Lehane has a new one coming but the only thing saving me right now is the fact that I don't have Gone, Baby, Gone in my house.<br />Lehane's writing is addictive.  The interplay between Kenzie and Gennaro feels authentic.  And the mysteries (in my gullible-reader view anyway) are sound.<br />Sacred is a bit &quot;lighter&quot; than previous Lehane novels I've read, but I find that the mystery and plot don't suffer and that &quot;light&quot;ness lends itself toward making me care more for Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro.<br />This is, indeed, a good thing.	2002-07-30

This installment in the life of Harry Bosch took me completely by surprise--I picked it up a few days ago, sure I was going to be able to stretch the reading out.  And that thought lasted until this morning when I picked this book up and became totally immersed in Connelly's City of Bones.  I felt like I was THERE.  Real life attempted to intrude a few times, but the look on my face and the sharpness in my voice convinced those who would dare interrupt, that I belonged in Hollywood with Harry....for the time being anyway!  The story itself held me spellbound--a battered child's bones found after 20 years--but it's Harry that keeps me there!  This is a hero I can relate to--one with flaws and passion and integrity.  One who makes mistakes and regrets it.  A hero that sticks up for the victim and for himself when it's necessary.<br />Not many authors can pull me INTO their stories but Connelly does possess this gift and I am ever so thankful for it!	2002-07-21

After some disappointment with the seventh installment in the Stephanie Plum series, I approached this one with some trepidation.  But, Stephanie and Joe, Ranger and Lula, Bob and Grandma Mazur are back!!  And they are better than ever in a novel that is a little darker than its predecessors, but a good solid story full of the belly laughs we've all come to expect in a Plum!! I am now eagerly awaiting #9--only about a year to go!!	2002-06-24

What a marvelous cast of characters!<br />This book is truly accessible to anyone who wants to read about loves won, loves lost and lives lived.  I saw myself in each one of these characters--and my friends in each character as well.  <br />Keyes weaves the stories of Katherine's, Tara's and Finton's pre-London lives into the fabric of the story with such expert care, you don't notice as a reader that you are jumping back in time.  Keyes simply uses these passages to highlight why a character chooses the way he/she does.  <br />The laughter in this book is heartfelt and the relationships are bittersweet--rather like real life, come to think of it!<br />This book was a thoughtful and laugh-out-loud page turner and I will be looking up more of Keyes' books in the future!	2002-05-28

I could not leave these characters dangling in midair while I concerned myself with sleep!!  From page 1 until the last page I was hooked--turning pages as fast as possible and growling at anyone who thought to interrupt me!<br />Coben has done it again with the characters--Will, Squares, Sheila, the Ghost--each with his/her own personality quirks and unique voice.  I love the fact that the father/son relationship is just as strong in this book as it is in his Bolitar series.  That draws me closer to the main character and I was most definitely drawn to Will.<br />The plot twists are extraordinary--one almost needs a map to keep up!!  But just almost.  Coben leads the reader through the maze of twists and turns like the master story teller he is.<br />Now to get some sleep......	2002-05-27

I have been searching for years for a Christian author who doesn't hit you over the head with the &quot;message.&quot; Up until now, Francine Rivers is the only one who could do that!!  I am so thankful to have found Penelope J. Stokes!!  This is the 2nd novel I have read by her and will now systematically work my way through her books!!  If any of them hold a candle to The Amethyst Heart, I am in for a rare treat!!<br />The Amethyst Heart captured my imagination from the beginning and held it until I closed the book.  What a fabulous history lesson this was....not written in a heavy-handed way, but pushed along with the strength of the characters Stokes draws.  I miss them already!!	2002-05-08
US	51824803	RRHUB18FEXMM8	078686804X	84738703	Black Water	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Wow!!	T. Jefferson Parker has been one of the most underrated writers, but if he continues like this everyone will know his name!<br />Black Water succeeds from every direction--plot, characterization, suspense level.  You name it and Parker has finely crafted it in this novel.  If I had had the time I would have read it in one sitting, but had to satisfy myself with waking up at 4:45 am two mornings in a row to get my &quot;fix&quot; before I left for work at 8!!<br />What really impressed me with this book was the character of Tim and how genuine he was.  It takes a rare talent to write a believable toddler and T. Jefferson Parker did it with Tim--not too precocious, thank heavens!<br />Highly recommended!!	2002-05-02

I got so tired of trying to keep up with these questions during this book I almost quit reading.  But, I perservered because I had heard this one was &quot;great.&quot;  Great it wasn't.  Mediocre, with the ends tied up in a neat bow is the most I can say for this story of a woman who can't decide who she wants, what she wants and how much she's going to &quot;take&quot; from the people around her.  I was disappointed with Delinsky's story here...find her most recent romantic/suspense novels to be much more satisfying-both with characters and storyline.	2002-03-28

With tears in my eyes and a smile on my lips, I finished this book at 1:30 in the morning.  What a treasure!  Grandma Rose, Dell, Kate, Ben, Joshua, etc are friends I am going to miss. So much.  I have already ordered a copy for my mother for Mother's Day....and am thinking of getting copies for my sisters as well.  Tending Roses is a highly readable, nonpreachy story of love, faith and family that I enjoyed from the first page and could not put down until I had finished! Highly, highly recommended!	2002-03-17

It has been a scant ten minutes since I closed the cover on my first book of 2002 and I miss these beloved characters already!<br />The Fiery Cross started out a little slow for me.  It took a couple of hundred pages for me to find its rhythm and to settle in with Jamie, Claire, Brianna, Roger and Jemmy.  It snuck up on me though, and before I knew it I was completely immersed in the life of 18th Century North Carolina.  The making of soap, the doctoring of wounds, the rumors of the coming war....all framed what this wonderful book is all about: the love of a family.<br />Ms. Gabaldon doesn't get sickly sweet or use gushing prose, but the emotions--the angst, the warmth, the fear, the love--come through in every passage. (Yes, even those I found slow at the beginning!)With each page I felt like I was there and I giggled and moaned--and yes, talked to--this book!  And I cried.<br />When a book summons these emotions, I know the author is an artist.	2002-01-08

I closed it with a smile on my face and a glimmer of the ol' Christmas Spirit in my heart.  I have already packaged it to be sent to my sister.  I am hoping she finishes quickly so we can pass it on to the next person--this is the best greeting card!!  A book that tells the parable of the Modern Day Christmas--craziness or simplicity?  Can we have both?!?!<br />Grisham writes characters we can identify with--with all the quirks and charms that we all have.  His cranky Luther reminds me of a half a dozen people I know (including myself!) and the urge to create the &quot;perfect Christmas&quot; is a universal theme suffered (!) by us all....	2001-12-03

I read this book yesterday and pieces and parts of it have stayed with me throughout today....<br />For a first novel, this one is breathtaking in its complexity.  The number of characters.  The layers of the relationships.  The finely woven story line.  I picked this book up, not sure I was in the mood to read it....alternately feeling as I read that I was IN New Orleans, that I was attending that school....but at the same time being witness to a horrific car wreck that I could not turn away from!<br />I will definitely look for more Christopher Rice in the future!  His writing is compelling, to say the least.....	2001-11-19

I usually ration out my Nora Roberts books so that I can pick one up after I've read a truly horrid book....but, this one I just had to pick up!!!  Am I glad I did!!!  Nora Roberts writing about New Orleans and the bayous??  The mystery and the romance written by my favorite author???  A match made in heaven for sure.  I started this book just before I went to sleep last night.  Knocked off the first chapter and went to sleep with a smile on my face....  Today, the book didn't leave my side until I had finished it!!  So what if dinner was late getting to the table?  So what if my son barely got a nod from me when he got home from school?  This was Nora writing about bayous and Louisiana and reincarnation and Lena and Declan and Lucian and Abby...he, that fabulous teenager, understands when I've got &quot;a Nora&quot; in front of me!!<br />I was hooked from the get go with this tale of love and redemption, murder and sadness.  Roberts' touch of romance <BR>interlaced with her wonderful sense of humor and a taste of mystery entertained and delighted!!	2001-11-13

Although Donald Hough has done this story in the book, The Cocktail Hour in Jackson Hole (to a degree anyway!), I have to say that visiting Mitford for 10 minutes at Christmas time was worth it!!  Imagining my old friends building snowmen and snowwomen and adding pieces and parts of themselves, took me back to my own childhood.....&lt;sigh&gt;<br />The illustrations are fantastic!!!  In a day and age when retro is &quot;in&quot; it was comforting to see the twinkling, old-fashioned illustrations.<br />This book makes me smile....	2001-11-02

They warned me how sad it was.  And they warned me how depressing it was.  What they didn't say was how simply beautiful it was.  Hoffman has so many different aspects of this book going at once--the number of characters and their points of view--it's amazing the way she keeps it simple.  Yet nothing in this book is &quot;surface&quot;--it is all deep and gut-wrenching.  When an author can lay out this many characters and explain how they feel--and why--with such precision and beauty, I know I want to read more of the author.  Alice Hoffman is a new favorite of mine.	2001-09-16

I don't know what it was about this book, but it quite simply touched my heart. I certainly didn't plan on it--I usually don't like the &quot;typical chick book&quot; so couldn't imagine why I started reading it.  When I started laying it aside, in order for it to last longer, I knew I had a winner on my hands.  Beautiful prose.  Relationships that were real.  Characters I could imagine myself being.  And the animals--Leroy, Verde and the carrot-eating dog!!!  This book is successful in every way I want a book to be.	2001-09-03

When it is possibly (with the exception of 2 Harry Potters) the first fantasy novel I have ever read, and it makes me want to read MORE then I know for sure I have a winner. I started the book carefully, and read carefully for the first 100 pages.....then I started looking forward to Jon's chapters only....then I was just trying to gulp the book down whole!!

I have to say my mom loaned me this book and told me it was a &quot;nice little read.&quot;  Well, it was more than that....this book only took me two days to read, but it's haunted me ever since.  I read it in the spirit in which it was intended I believe--a simple book of &quot;letters&quot; to a child....therefore I enjoyed it immensely.  It's the first time in a long time I have felt like crying as I read a book and I appreciate that in my reading.  If a book causes me to feel ANY kind of emotion, then it's a winner to me!	2001-08-16

I wanted a book with characters I cared about  on a higher-than-usual intensity level and APACHES delivered!!  By the end  of this book I cared about each and every &quot;good guy&quot; and hated  each and every &quot;bad guy&quot;--it is so nice to have the good guys  win!!!!	2000-08-28

I have been reading Julie Garwood for a long, long time and she never fails to deliver!   I was a little nervous with her &quot;new&quot; genre, but needn't have been!   She does the same thing with contemporary suspense  that she does with her historicals--makes you laugh and cry and care about  her characters! I am looking forward to a book about Noah now!	2000-07-30

I was a little bogged down with all the characters that were seemingly thrown at me during the first few chapters....and nearly set this  book aside. But, I perservered and am so glad I did!   Once I relaxed and  just let the story &quot;happen&quot; everything flowed together in one of  the best mystery/suspense novels I have ever written. These characters have  followed me around for days!  Compelling read.....	2000-07-28

I had a sneaking suspicion I would love this book--based on previous reads of IRON LACE and RISING TIDES--and Emilie Richards did NOT let me down!   This book is the best of story telling--characters to get involved with and  a story that weaves the present into the past smoothly.  A page turner with  lots of heart!	2000-07-25

Evanovich never fails to  deliver--her Stephanie Plum character remains true and strong and FUNNY!!   And the supporting characters are still a hoot!!  This one ranks right up  next to my favorite--Four to Score!	2000-07-09

Although I liked this book--Robards is an excellent weaver of Mystery/Romance--I got a little bogged down in the &quot;costume changes&quot;!   I especially liked the relationship between Sara and her  Mom--and the way the example of that relationship showed Seth and Chloe how  it was done.  I also appreciated not being able to guess who the bad guy  was until the very end!	2000-07-09

I just wish there had been more to them--it seemed like the author skimmed several different surfaces and only let us &quot;in&quot; on  Liam and Bretster. I hope she is working on something longer!   It seemed  like this one was just getting good when it ended......	2000-06-10

I guess if I was to tell you that I sleep in on the weekends, and that I had to get up two hours early today (Sunday) to finish this book, you would know it was good, right?  This is one of the best in the series....I was  very grateful they didn't do a lot of rehashing of the previous books in  this one.  I appreciated getting to know some of the other characters a  little better--David Hassid, for example.  When, however, will they quit  killing off all of their pilots?  (That, I must admit, is getting old!)	2000-05-28
US	51824803	R3Q0L9PESIEGIR	0449149676	542957512	On Mystic Lake: A Novel	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Realistic!	The story here is so realistic!  And I was so grateful to Ms. Hannah for not laying all the blame on the husband or wife....it's always taken two for a marriage to end.  The stories of AA were real here also and much  appreciated--not something you see often in literature or movies. I would  recommend this book to anyone who wants a story that touches their  heart....	2000-05-07

And then it unravelled into a mire of child abuse, incest, adultery.....I had a hard time finishing it.  The epilogue was the only thing that &quot;saved&quot; it for me.	2000-04-10

No really....I laughed, I cried....well, I really didn't cry, but I was sad to know Tim Cockey doesn't have the second book ready to go!   What a great story! --I will follow Hitchcock Sewell  anywhere he wants to go!  I just hope he takes his Aunt Billie and Alcatraz  with him!	2000-03-20

I enjoyed Seize the Night and Fear Nothing....but this hearkens back to the old Koontz I fell in love with--Whispers and Strangers and, of course, Watchers!  I couldn't put this  book down...haven't spoken to anyone in 2 days.  Kirkus Review is right:  Koontz leaves his competitors in the dust!	2000-02-28

I loved the character of Rachel...smart, sassy and strong.  And Gabe...wow!!  I found myself laughing and crying throughout the story...did  get strange looks from people while reading at the orthodontist's office  today--found myself laughing out loud!!  I liked the way the author wove  all the different characters together--no character or subplot was left  dangling when everything was said and done.  I am already searching for  more books by this author!!	1999-09-01

I was a little disappointed in her last book...meaning I could put it down.  This one I read cover to cover!!!  The plotting...the pacing...the characters kept me on the edge of my seat. Hope she keeps this  going...don't want her to become another Robin Cook.	1999-05-05
