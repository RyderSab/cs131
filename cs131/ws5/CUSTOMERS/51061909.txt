In just under 100 pages it rather restates the obvious, quoting from numerous sources to bolster its authority but never penetrating deeply the true nature of loneliness in a sensitive manner and how to come to grips with it.  The two authors are Ph.D.s who conduct workshops, according to the back cover, but their writing lacks authenticity; I do not get the sense that either of these two men have ever truly dealt with penetrating loneliness.  This is a rather generic book that fails to examine deeply and empathically any real-life situations or loneliness that is particular to either sex.  The book never deals with the issue of marginalization.  Rather, it faces loneliness as a kind of temporary problem, something akin to an experience that a child might face when there is no one available that day to play with after school.  It seems to be directed toward people who are used to being continually busy and suddenly find themselves with time on their hands, the authors' thesis being that solitude is necessary in order to draw us closer to God.  Well, of course it is.  But the authors themselves seem to confuse loneliness with solitude, even though they attempt to draw the distinction in their book.<br />Not much guidance and enrichment to be found in this little tome for dealing with the deeply spiritual problem of loneliness and isolation in the modern era.	2003-04-16

It describes the life of the author Shen Fu and his beloved wife, Ch'en Yun (1763-1803), in extremely revealing detail.  The intimacy and joy shared by the couple are as unusual by normal standards of Chinese married life as is the author's daringness in revealing them to others.  Their close, playful relationship stands in defiant opposition to the staid decorum of married life expected by Confucian ideology.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable and inspiring read.  Ch'en Yun is a woman ahead of her time who admirably balances her love of learning and passion for life with her duties and obligations as a traditional Chinese wife.	2002-08-06

Unlike most Arthurian romances, which deal with the end of Arthur's life and his death, in &quot;Sir Gawain,&quot; Arthur is still a youth, and the court is in its springtime. The main plot belongs to a type folklorists classify as the &quot;Beheading Game,&quot; in which a supernatural challenger offers to let his head be cut off in exchange for a return blow.  The poem is chock-full of games and exchanges.<br />Dr. Borroff studied under E. Talbot Donaldson, who translated &quot;Beowulf&quot; to prose during the same period at Yale.

Riding on the tails of Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island,&quot; &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; made H. Rider Haggard famous.  Much of what Haggard writes is based on his personal experience and observations in South Africa, where, unusual among the British colonizers, he learned Zulu, which gave him an insight lacking in his colleagues and contemporaries.<br />Although on the surface an adventure story for young boys, &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; raises interesting questions about the role of the colonists and their relationship with the African people on the eve of the great European scramble for Africa.  Like the elephants that Quatermain and his group hunt and shoot down simply because they are there for the picking, so Africa and its riches presented itself to the Europeans as rich for exploitation.  The question of &quot;What is a gentleman?&quot; runs throughout the narrative, leaving the European reader to discern whether Africans possessed a nobility and dignity comparable to the ancient Greeks and Biblical Hebrews.  Haggard depicts the Zulu language as comparable to the richly metaphoric Old and Middle English languages.<br />&quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; gives us a glimpse into a way of life that was shortly to disappear with the arrival of the Europeans.	2001-09-08

Although they do not need to be read in the order in which they appear, I recommend doing so, for their order follows the path of Nouwen's spiritual growth through this time of depression for him.<br />The overall theme of these spiritual imperatives is how to grow from being a needy person to trusting that God will and does fill those needs in us that no human can possibly fill: hence the title, \\"The Inner Voice of Love.\\" Over the course of this journey, Nouwen seemed not only to learn but to trust that love comes from within, rather than outside of ourselves. There is a place for human relationships in our lives, but it is also necessary to have a relationship with God, and how often these two relationships get confused. What does \\"a relationship with God\\" imply? Nouwen explores this question throughout his book.<br />Each spiritual imperative is a return to God, a grasping of distracting and worrying emotions and handing them over to God in a refreshing, insightful, and compassionate way. Each one brings God back to the center of one's life.	2001-09-08

He captures the drama, nobility, and poetry of this classic tale. Just as the medieval Anglo-Saxons felt a deep connection to their Nordic heritage, so \\"Beowulf\\" is an important piece of the contemporary story of Anglo-Saxon descendents. The story of \\"Beowulf\\" evokes a time of heroes and monsters, honor and vulnerability. It is an imaginative adventure story of a time gone by, a time \\"just over the horizon\\" to the original storytellers, of \\"the Spear-Danes in days gone by / and the kings who ruled them\\" who \\"had courage and greatness.\\" <br />Like the Hebrews' Exodus tale of their relationship with their God, Beowulf is the story of the Anglo-Saxons' relationship with their ancestors and how they came to be the people that they were and are today. It is a story of how to be a leader, full of sage advice: \\"A young prince must be prudent like that, / giving freely while his father lives / so that afterwards in age when fighting starts / steadfast companions will stand by him / and hold the line\\" (20-24). And finally, it is a story of how people managed through chaotic, quickly changing times, which might seem difficult to imagine in our own chaotic, quickly changing world. Yet Beowulf gives us this glimpse into the past, and gives us an appreciation both for how far we've come yet how we are grappling with similar issues of vulnerability as our ancestors did, just under different circumstances. Beowulf's world was one in which a people were vulnerable to raids without a leader to protect them. <br />It is a joy to read the passages side-by-side against their original Old English counterparts and to imagine how this story was originally told. Although Heaney explains in his introductory essay why he translated the first word of the poem, \\"Hwaet,\\" to \\"So,\\" I still miss the evocation that \\"Hwaet\\" implies: Listen! Lo! Hark! A story is about to begin! \\"So\\" seems to fall a little flat, even if it is in keeping with Heaney's Irish/Celtic heritage. <br />The language Heaney uses to describe Grendel, however, is rich and evocative[.] This tale is one that could be read to children; it excites and sparks the imagination.<br />Beowulf is a hero larger than life, boldly declaring to King Hrothgar, \\"Beowulf is my name\\" (343). <br />But Beowulf is also the story of a young warrior grown old who faces his mortality, and of a new generation and how it deals with changing power structures. Having long fought outer demons and monsters, Beowulf's final battle is against an inner one, a dragon who wakes from his sleep. Like Christ abandoned by his disciples, Beowulf's men abandon him and he must face the dragon alone-as we all do, ultimately, at our own death.	2001-09-08
US	51061909	R7P47MZEA4HRJ	0140180923	115107087	Lord Jim (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A deeply psychological novel	&quot;Lord Jim&quot; marks the beginning of the modern era of the novel. It breaks away from the linear storytelling mode of the Victorian era and instead shifts back and forth in time, gradually pulling together pieces of the story from different points of view that ultimately form an understanding, but never a clear rendering of &quot;the truth,&quot; which remains elusive and for the reader to discern.  It is a deeply psychological novel.  The protagonist, who is known to us only as &quot;Jim,&quot; the first mate of a ship in the British merchant marine, struggles with his ultimate decision to abandon, with the rest of the white crew, a seemingly sinking ship, the Patna, which is full of Muslim pilgrims.  The ship does not sink after all, and Jim must live with his fateful and enduring decision to &quot;jump&quot; from the Patna.  <br />The problem is that Jim does not live with it and reconcile himself to the choice to which he committed; instead, he continues to run away every time his past threatens to catch up with him.  Finally, he finds the opportunity to redeem himself, seemingly, on a remote island.  But even there, although he can escape gossipy tales of the Patna, he cannot escape himself, and therein he finally meets his resolution.<br />We learn about Jim through the eyes of a fellow sailor, Marlow, who is the narrator of &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; published the year before.  Marlow is obsessed with Jim, and it is equally intriguing to probe and to attempt to understand Marlow's fascination as it is to attempt to understand Jim himself.  <br />&quot;Lord Jim&quot; is a deeply disconcerting novel that, again departing from the Victorian narrative, doesn't tie up all the ends neatly for us at the end and present a satisfying resolution.  It's a haunting story whose questions will linger long after you've finished reading it.	2001-09-08

They respond not to being loved, but to being needed. Such women tend to be the product of emotionally unavailable parents and continue the pattern by forming relationships with emotionally unavailable, distant men. Norwood examines this behavior repeatedly, not only through portraits of women who fit these characteristics, but interestingly, through honest portraits of men who have been partners in such relationships.<br />Norwood's recommendations for countering this behavior include seeking help, making your own recovery the first priority in your life, finding a support group of peers who understand, developing a spiritual side through daily practice, stopping the practice of managing and controlling others, learning not to get hooked into games, courageously facing your own problems and shortcomings, cultivating whatever needs to be developed in yourself, learning how to become self-honoring, and sharing with others what you have learned. Overall, the focus is on self-development rather than seeking a solution in someone else who will love you as you think you want to be loved.	2001-07-15

His beautifully inquisitive and spiritual perspective views loving as something intimately intertwined with living and learning, a theme he develops more fully in \\"Living, Loving, and Learning.\\" Believing that love is a \\"learned phenomenon\\" (which led to his class on love at UCLA in the 1970s and ultimately, this book), Buscaglia's curiosity about the nature of love leads him to explore the writings of Erich Fromm, Abraham Maslow, Albert Schweitzer, Dag Hammarskjold, Mahatma Gandhi, Victor Frankl, Herbert Otto, the Old and New Biblical Testaments, the Koran, the Talmud, Buddhist and Hindu writings and to share his discoveries with us.<br />Buscaglia examines the many aspects of living the loving life. He views love as having a twofold purpose: its main function is to help unfold our true selves, while at the same time helping others to become strong and perfect themselves as unique individuals (a theme similarly examined by Milton Mayeroff in his work \\"On Caring\\"). Buscaglia encourages his readers not to take rejection personally, but rather, to view rejection compassionately. He encourages focusing on self-development and growth rather than attempting to change or conform to another person's point of view. Rejecting the Hollywood Doris Day/Rock Hudson game of so-called love, he views love as an experimental process that requires risk and forgiveness. <br />Buscaglia's \\"Living, Loving, and Learning\\" is a thoughtful and original follow-up to \\"Love.\\" The rest of his writings merely rehash the themes presented in these two works.	2001-07-15

It helps to answer in part questions that should be a part of any dating relationship: where is God in all of this, and what role does God play in our dating relationship?  How do I reflect God's values in my approach toward dating?<br />In Part 1, the authors recommend the approach of \\"taking God on a date\\" with you.  They encourage requiring and embodying truth in dating relationships, guard against repeating the past, and remind that \\"dating won't cure a lonely heart,\\" for that role belongs to God.  (Additional spiritual reading, such as Henri J. M. Nouwen's \\"The Inner Voice of Love,\\" support the theme of addressing needs and loneliness from a spiritual perspective as a foundation to addressing them from a relational perspective.) Part 2 examines character discernment of one's dating partner, and Part 3 examines self-reflection, particularly the issues of clinging to false hope (when a dating partner's actions don't support stated intentions) and the role of blame.  Part 3 is particularly valuable in assigning responsibilities to roles in the dating relationship, sorting out what's your responsibility and what responsibility lies with your dating partner.<br />Chapter 17, \\"Set Appropriate Physical Limits,\\" is the best discussion I've ever read on the long-term, destructive effect of premarital sex on our emotional, spiritual, and relational well-being.  Far more than being merely prohibitive, it examines deeply the importance of delaying self-gratification.  It provides a refreshingly thought-provoking and countercultural reminder that God's ways are not the ways of the culture in which we live, and what a challenge it is to integrate these two ways of life, should one choose to do so.<br />\\"Boundaries in dating is about becoming a truthful, caring, responsible, and free person who also encourages growth in those she is in contact with,\\" the authors write.  \\"Your dating life should be a powerful change agent for you.\\" Countering the common assumption that dating is limited to \\"finding the right one,\\" Cloud and Townsend take the spiritual approach that dating and relating is just as much about \\"learning about your own issues, how they affect others, and what to do about them.\\" That dating should bring us closer to God seems to be the authors' ultimate goal in writing this book.	2001-07-15

According to the authors, Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend, \\"safe people are individuals who draw us closer to being the people God intended us to be.\\" Cloud and Townsend \\"believe the Bible contains the keys to understanding how to tell safe people from unsafe ones. It also teaches how to become safe people for others. In this age of broken relationships, these scriptural principles are both timeless and timely.\\"<br />The authors devote Chapters 1 through 4 to examining and discussing who unsafe people are and the identifying traits of unsafe people. Chapters 5 through 8 examine the origin of the problem: why one might choose unsafe people to be in relationship with and how to repair this problem. The rest of the book is devoted to learning more about what safe people are and why we need them. The authors offer practical help on successfully meeting and relating to safe people. Overall, the book is designed to help one look both outside and inside oneself. As the authors cite from Matthew 7:5, \\"First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.\\"<br />Cloud and Townsend raise a valuable point in that people tend to look for people to be in relationship with who are \\"spiritual,\\" \\"godly, \\"ambitious,\\" \\"fund to be with,\\" and so on, and yet, these are not the issues that cause relationships to break apart. Relationships break apart because one partner doesn't listen to the other; because of perfectionistic tendencies; because of emotional distance; because of controlling tendencies; for promises that are made but not followed through; from condemnation, judgment, and anger; and most of all, because of a lack of or breakdown in trust. \\"We tend to look on the outside and not the inside of a person,\\" the authors state. \\"We look at worldly success, charm, looks, humor, status and education, accomplishments, talents and giftedness, or religious activity.\\" None of these qualities are character issues, which are precisely at the heart of both successful and failed relationships.<br />But the authors do not merely point the finger at unsafe people outside of ourselves. To begin with, a critical question they ask their readers is to reflect on what each one has learned about him- or herself from failed relationships. Furthermore, they tackle the issue of how our own actions reflect our relationship with God and how God lives through us. \\"The church often emphasizes our relationship with God and de-emphasizes our relationships with other people,\\" they write. \\"We need to be around others who help us to grow and become the people who God made us to be ... We often learn about the divine from the fleshly. As John writes, 'If anyone says, 'I love God,' yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen' (1 John 4:20).\\"<br />Recognizing that the typical response to being in relationships that have hurt is to retreat into isolation, withdraw, and shut down emotionally, Cloud and Townsend respond by citing the Bible to indicate that God created us to be in relationship with one another. \\"Finding safe people is not just a luxury,\\" they write. \\"It's a necessary part of growing spiritually mature ... Everyone is created to be relational.\\"<br />One way the authors counter the cultural norm toward self-sufficiency is by comparing spiritual hunger with physical hunger. \\"God created within us a hunger, a longing to be known and loved. This hunger functions exactly like physical hunger. It's a signal. It causes discomfort, a warning saying, 'Get up and get connected. Your tank's empty.' Hunger keeps us aware of our needs ... Make friends with your needs. Welcome them. They are a gift from God, designed to draw you into relationship with him and with his safe people. Your needs are the cure to the sin of self-sufficiency,\\" which pushes us only further into isolation.<br /> \\"The best example of a safe person is found in Jesus,\\" they write. \\"In him were found the three qualities of a safe person: dwelling, grace, and truth.\\" Safe people are also a very forgiving people, according to Cloud and Townsend. \\"They expect failure and disappointment from those they love ... Learn to receive forgiveness [and] learn to give forgiveness,\\" they suggest.<br />Finally, the authors deal with whether to repair or replace a hurting relationship. \\"The chief theme of the entire Bible is reconciliation of unsafe relationships.\\" While by no means suggesting that people remain in unsafe, dysfunctional, or abusive relationships, the authors differentiate between forgiveness in a relating sense and clearly drawing one's boundaries.<br />\\"The good news is that you can be saved from a life of relational hell with unsafe people. The bad news is that you must take up your cross and do the hard work of dealing with your own character problems. We have found in our lives and in the lives of others that this process works.

Unleashing your inventive powers, she claims, involves asking \\"what,\\" not \\"how.\\" It's being open to possibilities.  <br />Once we open our mind to creative possibilities, it's necessary then to focus authentically on who we are at heart.  \\"Authentic people are activated by their inner truths,\\" she writes.  \\"When we're authentic,\\" she claims, \\"others usually perceive us as such and will often go to great lengths to help us succeed ... When we're real, we're believable, credible.\\" Authentic focus also requires focusing on our energy.  \\"What good is it to identify your fascinations and goals if you're too tired or stressed out to pursue them? ... Vitality also translates into widened opportunities.  People like to be around us when we're centered and enthused.\\" By focusing on their own needs, Sinetar writes, entrepreneurs find ways to address others' needs and thereby profit.<br />\\"Meaningful purpose\\" delves deeper into the spiritual dimension of entrepreneuring.  It involves both posing and answering the question, \\"What exactly do you want out of life?\\" \\"No one can tell you what your purposes are,\\" Sinetar writes.  It involves moving slowly, gaining balance, poise, and self-understanding.  \\"This is a spiritual stance,\\" she writes.  She encourages her readers to grow in their \\"down\\" times and to develop discernment, which involves strict self-discipline.  She also warns that \\"conscious choices are often costly ones.\\" It is in delving into meaningful purpose that a rich personal transformation can take place.  It involves making honest self-assessments.<br />By\\"figuring-out\\" skills, Sinetar implies that \\"entrepreneurs trust the mystery of the unknown.  Rather than accepting imprisonment by what they don't understand, entrepreneurs strive to transcend their questions and limits.\\" This is where a genuine love of learning is required.  \\"Figuring out involves eliminating illusions.\\" It involves expanding on what we want by answering the questions of where, when, for whom, and why, and listing the steps you're willing to take to explore the territory you want to inhabit.<br />\\"Part of creating work involves establishing a solid foundation of chance-taking skills,\\" Sinetar writes.  Wisely, she advises practicing in low risks before undertaking high risks.  She writes about creating spaces in which to fail safely, to monitor our performance, to correct and improve ourselves.  She then illustrates a stepladder of risk-taking skills, and differentiates risk-taking from impulsivity.  \\"Begin small.  Go slow.  Build skill,\\" she says.  \\"Prudent risk-taking involves making contingency plans, asking `what if?' and assessing the probability of failure.\\" By taking small, calculated risks, she says, discernment grows.<br />In exploring what a strategic outlook is, Sinetar writes that it involves first elevating oneself to the point of feeling entitled to have the life and work one enjoys.  Strategy transcends a mere business plan, she writes.  Eventually, our strategies ask us to think about where we'll find supportive, affordable resources for our objectives.  Your decision to study whatever you don't understand becomes part of your strategy.  She encourages her readers to research specific ways to add value to customers and clients and to consider how to position your product or service in the niche you hope to enter.<br />Finally, \\"discovering and creating vocation requires discernment,\\" Sinetar writes.  Once the above six skills have been considered, \\"our job is to unfold.\\" A high spiritual intelligence recognizes that \\"we ourselves are the work.\\" It involves accepting that we must change.  A high spiritual intelligence realizes that \\"vocation comes as you discover and express your own identify.\\" It views work as art, recognizing that we learn best when we're learning about ourselves.  \\"Almost all gifted artists strive to mesh inner feelings or vision with marketplace realities,\\" she writes.  \\"Only actualizing adults find enough personal reward in such risks to accept the turmoil involved,\\" including family and inner conflict, struggle, and doubts.  Vocation is neither about career nor money, Sinetar writes; \\"it's doing God's will.\\"	2001-06-28

The drawings and quotes add a whimsical and creative touch.  The notes and suggestions are valuable and helpful, and the menus provide creative ways to combine several recipes from throughout the book.  The emphasis here is on fresh ingredients-not necessarily expensive, exotic, or hard-to-find, but always fresh ingredients.  Both the recipes and the menus range from the simple to the exotic and creative, but always fun and flavorful, never ordinary.  Even the simple recipes, however, possess a certain richness that makes them special.<br />\\"The Silver Palate's\\" organizational approach makes it a reference to which I've returned frequently over the past decade.  \\"To Begin a Great Evening\\" is broken down into \\"Fancy Finger Food,\\" \\"Fresh From the Sea,\\" \\"The Crudités Connection,\\" \\"The Charcuterie Board,\\" and \\"Dazzlers,\\" all of which cover a wide range of hors d'oeuvres for varied occasions.  The recipes range from casual to elegant and involved.  I found the Aioli Platter particularly fun, a \\"lusty community\\" Provencal meal in which poached fish (cod), cooked vegetables (cauliflower, artichoke hearts, chickpeas, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, beets, and garlic), hard-boiled eggs, and garlicky Aioli sauce held by a hollowed-out artichoke are the main components.<br />\\"Soup's On\\" is broken down into \\"Soups to Start,\\" \\"Soups of the Sea,\\" \\"Summer Soups,\\" and \\"Sunday Night Soups.\\" The Bouillabaisse is wonderful, with an interesting side note about making \\"authentic Bouillabaisse\\" and wine and side accompaniments.  The Summer Soups include a great recipe for gazpacho as well as Greek Lemon Soup (avgolemono).  The Sunday Night Soups include a hearty as well as tasty Potato-Cheese Soup, Beef and Red Wine Broth, Basque Rice and Pepper Soup, and Peasant Vegetable Soup.<br />\\"Pasta Perfect\\" is broken down into \\"Piping Hot Pasta\\" and \\"Summer Pasta.\\" The authors provide a helpful pasta glossary and includesuch simple recipes as Spaghetti with Oil and Garlic.  The Pasta Sauce Raphael, a spicy tomato-and-artichoke sauce, is tasty, as is Pasta with Sausage and Peppers.  The Pasta Puttanesca with garlic, capers, olives and anchovies is excellent.  Also included is traditional Linguine with White Clam Sauce and an unusual Green Lasagna, a combination of soft, fresh goat cheese; fresh basil; and spinach pasta.  The Summer Pasta includes a delicious and easy Linguine with Tomatoes and Basil and a fantastic Pesto recipe.<br />In \\"The Main Course,\\" the authors cover \\"Chicken Every Way,\\" \\"Sweet and Savory Meats,\\" \\"Game,\\" \\"Catch of the Day,\\" \\"Baking in Foil,\\" and \\"The Stew Pot.\\" The chicken recipes are particularly versatile and delicious.  Chicken Marbella is a winner and Raspberry Chicken is fun.  The authors provide a Summer Chicken recipe that takes advantage of mustard and basil.  The Lemon Chicken is great on picnics.  Recipes are also included for Fruit-Stuffed Rock Cornish Hens and Our Favorite Way to Roast a Turkey.<br />\\"Sweet and Savory Meats\\" includes diverse recipes for Filet of Beef, Glazed Corned Beef, Pork Chops with Black Currant Preserves, Baked Ham with Glazed Apricots, Roast Lamb with Peppercorn Crust, Oriental Lamb Chops, Veal Chops with Sherry and Lemon Marmalade, Roast Shoulder of Veal, Veal Scallops in Mustard-Cream Sauce, and an intriguing Roast Suckling Pig.  The authors also include three \\"fork suppers\\" of Flank Steak Mosaic, Fruit-Stuffed Loin of Pork, and Veal Roll.  The game recipes include Ragout of Rabbit Forestiere, Pheasant with Leek and Pecan Stuffing, and Venison Stew.<br />\\"The Stew Pot\\" is a particularly tasty section.  The authors include recipes for Beef Stew with Cuminseed, Beef Carbonnade, Pot Roast, Beef Stroganoff, Braised Short Ribs of Beef, Chili for a Crowd, Sausage Ragout, Winter Pork and Fruit Ragout, Choucroute Garnie, Dilled Blanquette de Veau, Navarin of Lamb, Osso Buco, and Oxtail Stew.<br />Each vegetable has its own section-artichokes, asparagus, beans (with great recipes for Cassoulet and White Bean and Sausage Soup with Peppers), carrots (Raspberry-Marinated Carrots), eggplant (Ratatouille and Eggplant Parmigiana), mushrooms (Creamed Mushrooms, which are superb in omelets), potatoes (wonderful Stuffed Potatoes recipes), scallions/leeks/garlic/shallots/onions (Six-Onion Soup), tomatoes--which is particularly useful as each vegetable comes into season.  There is also a section on vegetable purees, all of which were a welcome deviation from standard mashed potatoes. \\"Salads\\" is divided into \\"Significant Salads\\" (with a wonderful Duck and Pear Salad with Mango Chutney Dressing, Greek Lamb and Eggplant Salad, and Balsamic Vinaigrette), \\"Summer Salads,\\" \\"All-American Salads,\\" \\"Salads of the Sea,\\" and \\"Salads on the Green.\\"  This last section includes a Green Sampler (a guide to salad greens) and primers on olive oil and vinegar.  The Raspberry Vinaigrette, Green Peppercorn Vinaigrette, Garlic-Mustard Dressing, Champagne Dressing, Sherry Vinaigrette, Walnut Oil Vinaigrette, and Basil-Walnut Vinaigrette are all delicious.<br />\\"Cheeses and Breads\\" contains a valuable primer on cheeses and a wide variety of \\"Best Breads\\" recipes.  The \\"Sweets\\" chapter includes \\"The Cookie Basket,\\" and a great section on apples (\\"American as Apple ...\\"), particularly valuable in the fall with a useful apple chart and a wonderful recipe for applesauce.  \\"It's the Berries,\\" on the other hand, is particularly useful in Summer, with numerous strawberry recipes (including good ones for Strawberry Ice Cream and Strawberry Shortcake) as well as recipes for other berries, including traditional blueberries and raspberries.  \\"Sweets\\" also includes sections on \\"Mousse Magic\\" and \\"Essentially Chocolate.\\" \\"Hot From the Oven\\" includes pie and cake recipes, and \\"Comforting Conclusions\\" includes comfort desserts such as Gingerbread.<br />\\"The Brunch Bunch\\" has a useful section on making omelets with suggestions for an Appleand Cheddar Omelet, Creamed Mushroom Omelet, and Ratatouille Omelet.  There is also a section on Brunch Drinks.<br />Finally, the \\"Basics\\" chapter includes useful recipes for homemade mayonnaise; pie crusts; crème fraiche; beef, chicken, and fish stocks; quick tomato sauce; and parsleyed and nutted wild rice, among recipes.<br />\\"The Silver Palate Cookbook\\" is one of only a handful of cookbooks that I own and to which I turn again and again.

She has written novels, short stories, essays, nonfiction, and poetry. Although I don't believe her short stories stand out as brilliantly as does the rest of her writing, they are nonetheless enjoyable reading.<br />The two stories in this collection that particularly stood out to me were the title story, \\"Homeland,\\" and \\"Covered Bridges.\\" \\"Homeland\\" is the moving story of Gloria St. Clair, a native of \\"a coal town hacked with sharp blades out of a forest that threatened always to take it back,\\" and her \\"Great Mam,\\" a woman who belonged to the Bird Clan, \\"one of the fugitive bands of Cherokee who resisted capture in the year that General Winfield Scott was in charge of prodding the forest people from their beds and removing them westward.\\" It is particularly lyrical and full of evocative images, metaphors, and language, drawing on Kingsolver's own Kentucky and Cherokee roots and apparent love of the land and its native peoples.<br />\\"Covered Bridges\\" has a familiar Kingsolver protagonist with a background that reflects Kingsolver's own educational and professional background in biology, and particularly her interest in quirky, little-known biological facts. Lena is a specialist in toxicology and operates a poison hotline at the county hospital. We also discover that Lena has a deadly allergy to the stings of bees and wasps. \\"Covered Bridges\\" explores the relationship between Lena and her husband and examines the question of whether or not they want to have children.<br />I readily recommend Kingsolver's earlier work, but discourage reading her more recent work, starting with \\"Prodigal Summer.\\" I admire her most for the risks she takes in tackling new and different projects and genres (even \\"Prodigal Summer\\"), rather than rehashing the same, well-worn theme. Reading these stories provides a fuller picture of who she is as an author and where her passions, concerns, and interests lie.	2001-06-26

In the final analysis it is what we do that tells us and others what kind of person we are and what are our deepest values or antipathies.\\" In this respect, she echoes Kahlil Gibran when he said, \\"Work is love made visible.\\"<br />\\"Right livelihood is predicated upon conscious choice,\\" she writes, as well as commitment and mindfulness. It means using work \\"fully for our own development and enrichment,\\" as opposed o the economy's. It requires a level of self-esteem that \\"treats yourself as if you count.\\"<br />\\"Before being capable of selecting a type of work that fits us, we have to be persons who behave daily in ways that support and enhance our lives,\\" Sinetar writes. In other words, we must \\"validate and express our most cherished values\\" on a daily basis. Sinetar then takes her readers through a process of values clarification and demonstrates how upholding the values you cherish through your work actually rewards yourself and enhances your self-esteem. Work then becomes \\"something connected to the self ... a mirror of the person.\\"<br />\\"The Money Will Follow\\" part of Sinetar's title implies not riches but rather the leap of faith required to risk taking responsibility for your own Right Livelihood, which Sinetar identifies less as hope than as resourcefulness: \\"the ability to deal with any kind of situation ... based upon the individual's faith that he can solve his own problems ... We truly evolve and grow only when we take control of our own circumstances and fears.\\"<br />\\"I've made do with a lot less than I ever thought I could, and have even found fulfillment and satisfaction in a simpler life,\\" one of her studies reports. \\"It's been hard, but in some ways it's also been a blessing.\\"<br />Work that is Right Livelihood allows \\"weaknesses to be worked on\\" while \\"strengths and talents grow into full use,\\" while being linked with others. \\"The actualizing individual is intrinsically involved with his work and uses it to help him understand the world around him.\\" Such work is \\"a key vehicle for expressing their most positive emotions. They describe their efforts as a way to demonstrate their affection for others and to grow in respect for themselves ... They protect their time, say 'no' to unrewarding social invitations, recoil-naturally and without much guilt-from toxic people, situations, jobs and responsibilities. It is as if they instinctively know what they must do with their time and energy, and then determine to do only that ... The motivation that ignites the individual is positive, loving, devotional and earnestly sincere.\\"<br />\\"Do What You Love\\" is a book worth revisiting frequently throughout the transformation from job or career to intentional, purposeful work lived as Right Livelihood. Her follow-up work, \\"To Build the Life You Want, Create the Work You Love: The Spiritual Dimension of Entrepreneuring\\" further explores the spiritual challenges particular to entrepreneuring; \\"Do What You Love\\" does not restrict itself to entrepreneuring as the only way to perform work that you love.	2001-06-22

As Jesus began his ministry here on earth, so Janet Holm McHenry encourages us to begin each day.<br />\\"PrayerWalk\\" is a great idea, but it could have benefited from tighter editing. The idea is drawn out way past its time, and the writing becomes repetitive. And why is it targeted only toward women? Unless you need to be convinced that walking is simple and beneficial to one's health, as well as how to go about it, about one-third of this book can be skipped or at least skimmed over. And why is \\"PrayerWalk\\" capitalized twice in the title, but referred to as \\"prayerwalk\\" throughout the rest of the book, as well as in Amazon.com's own reference to the title?<br />The \\"great idea,\\" however, is taking the perspective of God as one's \\"Personal Trainer.\\" McHenry portrays a God as waiting at the doorstep for us to begin our morning walk together: a date with God! \\"How could I stay in bed when God was waiting for me? I got up!\\" Certainly, the first third of \\"PrayerWalk\\" helps focus on making a morning walk a much more intentional practice.<br />In her chapter on \\"Making Time,\\" McHenry makes the insightful and amusing suggestion that God \\"wants us to have regular garage sales.\\" \\"If I'm not regularly holding spiritual garage sales to give up spaces of my life, then I'm not sincere in my desire to know Christ more fully ... We cannot do all that we'd like to do. We have to make choices ... As Christians, we are called to have different priorities ... Before you start prayerwalking, determine that you will put God first in your life ... Instead of looking for snatches of time, commit to meeting God regularly and faithfully, and then trust that the other choices of your day will be the right ones ... God is now the number-one priority of your day.\\"<br />McHenry's revelation of how prayerwalking helped her deal with her father's death, however, comes across as embarrassingly immature. The author fully reveals her emotional dependency on her father, rather than a deep and mature relationship with him. It is possible, then, to view her prayerwalking as transferring her emotional dependency on her father to a man-like but omnipotent God, in a very fundamentalist sense.<br />The last third of McHenry's book takes on a very simplistic, born-again tone. Her suggestion for \\"spiritual mapping,\\" adapted from C. Peter Wagner's \\"Breaking Strongholds in Your City,\\" is interesting and thought-provoking, but for more intellectual reasons than praying against \\"the enemy.\\" And although McHenry describes prayerwalking has having brought about a heightened awareness in her, her last chapter, \\"Faces of Answered Prayer,\\" seems too simplistic and results-oriented, the exact opposite of what prayer should be. Prayer is reflection, a dialogue and relationship-building with God, a focus on the life that we are a part of. It is not a shopping list we present to God.<br />Overall, however, \\"PrayerWalk\\" can contribute toward undertaking one's morning walk as an intentional, rather than incidental, prayerwalk, which in itself is a valuable lesson in discipline and a step toward spiritual growth and insight.	2001-06-07

For it is where you may discover that all you have is a collection of severely limited ideas.\\" Richard Bach's books \\"simply state and restate and restate themselves.\\" He tends to seek magical solutions outside of himself, rather than plow within himself to unearth new and deep truths.<br />The best part of \\"The Bridge Across Forever,\\" well worth the price of the book, is Leslie's letter to Richard. Is it a treasure to which I have returned many times over the years. And it is no wonder that Leslie and Richard are divorced, for Leslie nailed it right the first time.<br />\\"The Bridge Across Forever\\" is well worth reading for Leslie's perceptive analysis of the state of their relationship. It is interesting to read Richard's response to her insight, and at the same time tragic, for ultimately, he never gets it. He returns to his same old habits of denial and wishful thinking. \\"You are one of the most selfish people I have ever known,\\" Leslie says. \\"I've needed my anger to keep you from trampling right over me, to let both of us know when enough is enough ... It is by NOT always thinking of yourself, if you can manage it, that you might someday be happy.

I'd give anything if you could see what's there for us ... But if it's out of sight for you, I guess it doesn't exist, does it? Even if I'm looking at it, it's not really there.\\"<br />\\"The Bridge Across Forever\\" is a story of both hope and, ultimately, despair. \\"We have both had a vision of something wonderful that awaits us,\\" Leslie writes. \\"Yet we cannot get there from here. I am faced with a solid wall of defenses and you have the need to build still more. I long for the richness and fullness of further development, and you will search for ways t avoid it as long as we're together.

US	51061909	R25QFZXD7JDBO5	0060175400	951868170	The Poisonwood Bible	Books	3	0	1	N	N	An Oprah-style journey into "The Heart of Darkness"	In \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" Barbara Kingsolver executes satisfactorily the essential elements of a provocative story: satisfying character development, suspense, and attention to detail. The four daughters in her story, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May, have distinct voices and successfully serve as foils and mirrors against each other. All of them reflect pieces that can be found in many of us.<br />Rachel is the unabashed American, representative of American culture at its worst and most self-absorbed. Because Kingsolver portrays her with such compassionate humor, Rachel allows us to see ourselves in her, without the need to put up our defenses and shun that aspect of ourselves that resides in many of us. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in her autobiography, \\"The Wheel of Life,\\" writes of her realization at the end of World War II that \\"there is a Hitler in all of us.\\" So, too, is there the potential for a Rachel in all of us, as Kingsolver illustrates in her contemporary journey into Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\"<br />In contrast, it is pure joy and discovery to watch Leah develop over the course of the novel. Indeed, all of the daughters develop, deepen, and mature over time. Their experience in Africa changes their lives, as it hopefully will yours, too, when you read this novel. \\"Love changes everything,\\" says the voice of Leah. Indeed, it does; her love for Africa lost, as well as Kingsolver's, changes everything. You cannot escape this novel without having gained a greater compassion for the tragedy that is Africa, the richness that has been exploited. Yet this is not a sentimental, naïve, or simplistic, knee-jerk-liberal perspective of Africa. Kingsolver's portrait is rich in complexity and depth. It is through the different characters' eyes that the complexity of Africa and its history are revealed. In particular, Leah's return to America, when she stands inside a supermarket and experiences wonderment, anger, and shame, should resonate with anyone who has lived outside the US, as it certainly did with me.<br />Adah, too, develops in a surprisingly revealing way. Adah, physically injured at birth and emotionally injured growing up in the United States, illustrates with perfect clarity our culture's discomfort with differences. In Africa, however, her physical \\"abnormality\\" fits right in, and it is her \\"perfect\\" sisters who stand in stark contrast to the maimed natives for whom no modern medical care is available. How Adah resolves and makes peace with her physical and emotional situations is one of the most satisfying discoveries revealed in the novel. Adah is tempted with the opportunity for romance, once she discovers that she is healed. When she discovers, however, that it is only her healed, perfect self that is acceptable to her potential lover, rather than her imperfect self, she rejects the opportunity to thus deny this very real part of herself. So, too, will Africa be acceptable and righted to us, only when it \\"cleans up its act\\" and behaves in a \\"civilized\\" manner? Or can we accept Africa in its blackness, its stark contrast to our blonde whiteness, with its warts and all, and what it mirrors to us about our own warts?<br />Adah's poetic voice is pure joy and beauty to read. Her poetry reveals the language that resides inside of all of us, if only we listen to it and refuse to be distracted by the sounds of our own voices. By not being able to talk as a child, Adah is permitted to develop a rich, though dark, inner voice. The darkness of her poetry also reveals the deep necessity of relationship among us. Because Adah, like many of us, has no one to discuss with and thereby work through her disturbing inner thoughts-her dark side, like Africa's, is shunned in the \\"Land of General Electric\\"-she does not begin to find resolution until \\"the Exodus,\\" when she is forced to make a positive choice for herself. \\"The Exodus\\" is Adah's turning point, when she ceases to see herself as baggage heaped upon her family, and beginsto take responsibility for her own life. So, too, at the time of the Exodus--the Congo's independence--the Congo ceases to be the \\"white man's burden\\" and begins to come into its own.<br />But \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is not merely a story of compassion for Africa. Expect to be angered when you read this story. Readers familiar with Kingsolver's earlier works will recognize her anger at having been betrayed in her benevolent trust of this country's elected public officials and the arrogance of their actions. This anger over betrayal, as well as the poetic voice revealed in Adah, can be found also in her collection of poetry, \\"Another America.\\"<br />Reading \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" reawakened my curiosity surrounding the circumstances of the death of Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN Secretary General who died while assisting independence negotiations in the Congo. I have since begun reading Brian Urquhart's biography, \\"Hammarskjold,\\" as well as Michael Wrong's new book, \\"In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz.\\" Both have added more dimension to the continuing story of the Congo.	2001-05-25

What you discover about yourself as you write these pages and allow yourself the space to play might very well turn your world upside down. The rest of \\"The Artist's Way\\" discusses how to deal with the raw, emotional self that has been buried for so long, particularly the anger and grief that will likely emerge when you realize how much of yourself you have buried in your adult life.<br />These two simple actions are remarkably effective. Cameron encourages the reader to persevere, even if it means beginning by writing three pages of \\"This is stupid; I have nothing to write.\\" It takes time to develop a relationship with anyone, even oneself.<br />Cameron's later books, \\"Vein of Gold\\" and \\"The Artist's Way at Work,\\" merely reiterate, rather than develop, the themes she presents in this seminal work.	2001-05-25

She shares how she has learned to live life as an intentionally focused individual, offering Jesus&#8217; own life as an example of reflective living.  Sheridan invites single adults to take a &#8220;bold step&#8221; and embrace a lifestyle she calls &#8220;focused living,&#8221; a way of living that encourages and develops spiritual depth, personal effectiveness, and social consciousness.  The practices and values she encourages include self-reflection, a commitment to deep prayer, participation in intentional community, friendship with silence and solitude, proper balance in work, the study of sacred and spiritual resources, a preferential option for the poor, reverence for one&#8217;s body, home as a sacred place, hospitality as a way of life, stability in relationships, and disciplines in daily living, all of which culminate in the creation of a personal &#8220;rule.&#8221;<br />According to Sheridan, our institutions and our culture reinforce the idea that singlehood is a &#8220;limbo&#8221; state in between or on the path toward the &#8220;legitimate&#8221; state of marriage.  The church typically addresses the genuine need of single people for meaningful community merely by providing social settings for singles in which to gather.  &#8220;For the unwilling celibate, community is often missing.  Sadly, it is what we need most.  Standing at the margins of the &#8216;official&#8217; church, the single adult envies those who appear to have community: the married, the ordained, the professed religious&#8212;and he or she wonders how to get there.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Our church does not offer us a hand,&#8221; Sheridan writes.  &#8220;Sure, we can get involved in all sorts of committee and ministry work, which many of us do.  But no one ministers to us; we are left to our own devices.The antidote for isolation and all of its many entrapments, of course, is community, but only community of a special kind.  Families, friendships, and workplace relationships all constitute community and they support us in their unique ways, but what the single person needs is a community that promotes growth to wholeness by developing a heightened awareness of the spiritual aspect of everyday life.....<br />Most beneficial in Sheridan&#8217;s exploration of the spiritual single life is her suggestion for participating in what she refers to as &#8220;intentional community,&#8221; as opposed to the larger &#8220;accidental&#8221; communities to which we already belong: our workplaces, civic and political organizations, educational institutions, and even the church itself.  According to Sheridan, an intentional community is &#8220;one in which I and other like-minded people overtly expressed our mutual commitment to one another in a conscious and deliberate way.&#8221; An intentional Christian community is consistently committed to a high degree of mutuality in their relationships; pursues an informed critical awareness of and an active engagement within the cultural, political, and economic megasystems of their society; cultivates and sustains a network of lively connections with other persons, communities, and movements of similar purpose; and attends faithfully to the Christian character of their community&#8217;s life.  Sheridan insists that a central focus of intentional community must be social justice.<br />In addition, Sheridan offers a rich bibliography of resources.  She suggests Albert Nolan&#8217;s &#8220;Jesus Before Christianity&#8221; as an example of living with and among, not apart from, human society, particularly the poor.  Dick Westley&#8217;s &#8220;Redemptive Intimacy: A New Perspective for the Journey to Adult Faith&#8221; is a valuable resource in participating in intentional community.  Parker Palmer&#8217;s &#8220;To Know As We Are Known: A Spirituality of Education&#8221; also proved to be another insightful discovery, as well as the writings of Thomas Merton and Henri Nouwen.  Sheridan also draws on the writings of other single Catholics struggling with their spirituality, including Dag Hammarskjold&#8217;s &#8220;Markings&#8221; and Dorothy Day&#8217;s &#8220;The Long Loneliness,&#8221; the source for the title of Sheridan&#8217;s book.  To this list I would add Mary Beth Rogers&#8217; &#8220;Cold Anger,&#8221; another excellent resource for intentional community and public relationship-building.	2001-05-24

At the same time Rogers also reveals how not only the poor and working class have unwittingly given away their political power, but how white, upper-middle-class citizens have also consented to having power taken away from them in their benign trust of elected public officials.<br />The \\"cold anger\\" of the title is \\"not one based on sour resentments or a false sense of entitlement,\\" but rather, \\"an anger that seethes at the injustices of life and transforms itself into a compassion for those hurt by life.\\" Anger for Ernesto Cortes, co-founder of the IAF, and the people he organizes is \\"an emotion of hope-not of despair.\\"<br />Rogers tells the story of how Communities Organized for Public Service (COPS), the first IAF-inspired organization of congregations, used that cold anger to move the city of San Antonio to spend more than $500 million for West Side improvements, including storm sewer systems that virtually ended flooding there.  Through research actions, COPS members \\"exploded the myth most of them had accepted for years-that the city in its wisdom would take care of them in good time.\\"<br />\\"We weren't looking for any handouts,\\" according to one COPS member.  \\"We're taxpayers and we found out our tax money wasn't working for us.\\"<br />\\"The concept we're trying to develop is one of community, communal responsibility,\\" says Cortes.  \\"The work we do is about power and about building power and teaching people how to organize around their own interests, how to be effective.  We need power to protect what we value.\\"<br />Not surprisingly, many church members are initially uncomfortable with the idea of power.  IAF organizers, however, seek to replace the traditionalunderstanding of coercive power with one of relational power.  According to Cortes, &quot;there are only two ways to build power like this.  It takes organized money or organized people.  We're obviously not going to have a huge concentration of money, so when we're talking about power as a social concept, we're talking about two or more people coming together with a plan and acting on it.\\" In addition, Cortes says, \\"we're trying to teach a system of internal accountability so that corruption won't happen.\\" Cortes credits a large part of his understanding of relational power to Paul Tillich's Love, Power and Justice, in which Tillich proposes that love and power must be joined to produce justice.<br />&quot;Organizing is a fancy word for relationship building,\\" says Cortes.  \\"If I want to organize you, I don't sell you an idea.  What I do, if I'm smart, is try to find out what's your interest.  What are your dreams?  I try to kindle your imagination, stir the possibilities, and then propose some ways in which you can act on those dreams and act on those values and act on your own visions.  You've got to be the owner.  Otherwise, it's my cause, my organization.  You've got nothing!&quot;<br />Rogers describes the relational style of Sister Christine Stephens, a Catholic nun turned political organizer.  \\"It is selective and sensitive, probing rather than prying.  It is like maneuvering a freshly crafted key into a door lock, which, when it fits, seems to open you as well as the other person.\\"<br />\\"When you sell, you tend to be arrogant,\\" says Cortes.  \\"You know it all ... You quit listening.  You're not attentive.\\"<br />\\"In proposing, rather than selling,\\" Rogers writes, \\"Cortes believes you have to have flexibility, curiosity, patience, and a little vulnerability.  And that involves some self-revelation as well as propositioning.  The best organizers and leaders learn how to reveal themselves in small doses as part of the process of drawing out others ... The successful one-on-one becomes a give-and-take relationship, not a one-sided interview.\\"<br />\\"If we don't go anywhere, it's because these one-on-ones don't develop ... This is where the spiritual action is,\\" according to Cortes.  \\"We teach people that the relationship is more important than the issue ... For you to grow and develop, you have to get out of yourself into the skins of others.\\" According to Cortes, every time we engage another individual on a deep level of human understanding, we also develop ourselves spiritually and politically.  \\"The one-on-one is the most radical thing we teach.\\"<br />IAF organizers and leaders commit themselves to working with other people on a one-on-one basis \\"to help them grow beyond themselves and participate as a full citizen in the public life of their community.\\"<br />The IAF ultimately distinguishes itself from other organizing efforts by attracting people not to issues, but rather, by encouraging church leaders to act on their gospel values, the roots of their public and private beliefs.  \\"This is not merely politics we are engaged in,\\" according to one COPS member, \\"but correcting injustice, which is God's work and the mission of the church.\\"	2001-05-21

She demonstrates quite convincingly that while other systems outside the White Male System, such as the Female System, the African-American System, the Mexican-American System, and the Native American System, all have to be aware of both systems (their own as well as the White Male System) in order to survive, the White Male System, since it is in power, has no need to be aware of any other system than its own.  Many of the points she brought up resonated with me, and I grew quite depressed as I realized my own complicity in struggling to fit in with the White Male System rather than embracing my own Female System.<br />&quot;Women's Reality&quot; is not a book about victimhood, however; its purpose is to bring about an awareness that there are different ways of relating with one another and that the White Male System is not &quot;reality.&quot; Rather, as women, or anyone else who does not fit into the White Male System, we can create our own reality, and we are not required to adhere to the defensive, fearful White Male System dualistic paradigm of &quot;my way or the highway.&quot; Ms. Schaef doesn't seek to topple the White Male System and replace it with another; rather, she seeks to bring about an awareness that multiple paradigms of relating with one another do indeed exist and should be respected for the value that each can bring to relationship-building in all its forms.<br />&quot;Women's Reality&quot; is not an advice or a how-to book; its greatest strength lies in bringing about an awareness of the cultural differences between men, women, and anyone else who doesn't fit neatly into the White Male System.  I found it to be much more analytical and much less patronizing than &quot;Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.&quot; The phrase &quot;Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus&quot; has been so overused that it diminishes the very real differences that exist between men and women and turns them into a joke.  &quot;Women's Reality,&quot; written 10 to 15 years before &quot;Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus&quot; is a an analysis from a woman's perspective of what it means to be born to a second-class status behind men, and how we spend our lives trying to conform to the White Male System.  The sad reality about &quot;Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus&quot; is that it perpetuates the idea that women should conform to the White Male System of relating.  &quot;Women's Reality,&quot; by comparison, recognizes that although we must be aware of how the White Male System operates in order to survive, it doesn't mean that we have to become caught up in it ourselves; there are alternatives.	2000-12-15

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to hear her read from this book from poetry, and I was enchanted at what one could express with so few words, so simply and eloquently and powerfully and emotionally. Her poems take surprising twists that gave them a staying power in my mind. If you are skeptical about poetry, as I was, read her essay that acts as the introduction to this collection. It changed the way I think and respond to poems.<br />These poems resonated particularly with me in two ways: as a woman and as someone who lives near the border and who has come to appreciate the history of Mexican-Americans and Latin Americans. They helped change the way I think both about myself as a woman and about this land I share with people who have been here for hundreds of years. The poems appear side-by-side in Spanish and English, which I found particularly valuable: it increased my appreciation for the beauty of the Spanish language and the beauty and power of language in general. My particular favorite is the poem \\"Naming Myself,\\" which for me was a turning point in this collection. For me, it sums up everything about the power of identity, how carelessly we can give it away as young women, and how powerful it is to reclaim it. This poem applies not only to women, however, but ties in strongly with the rest of the collection, in its exploration of what it means to be an American, what the name \\"America\\" means to both Americans and non-Americans, and the disenfrachisement suffered by many when they are excluded from taking on the identity of Americans or it is demanded of them to relinquish their Latin American identities.<br />It's also well worth browsing the \\"Selected Titles from Seal Press\\" at the end of the book. How delightful to discover this apparently small, independent press! A number of titles by women from all over the world caught my eye.<br />I deeply regret that I was clueless about the richness and struggles of Latin American culture and society until I moved to Tucson and had the opportunity to experience and interact with this culture personally and firsthand. I cannot think of a more fitting title for this collection than \\"Another America.\\" I encourage you to read it to gain a perspective of America through the eyes of Latin Americans. Barbara Kingsolver's writing resonates with me personally because it seems that she, too, discovered a whole new world upon moving to Tucson. It's an important perspective to have if you're an Anglo-American, to increase and broaden your awareness and deepen your appreciation for what we have and this land we share with our Latin American neighbors.	2000-10-29

The only chapters I found useful, however, were 1 through 3. This book alone was insufficient to teach me the basics of XML and how I could integrate it with my VB project. I had to do a great deal of research on the Web to supplement the information provided in this book. The authors quote extensively from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which can be read directly and more up-to-date on the Web.<br />The most useful information I derived from this text was the introduction to XML covered in Chapter 1 and the understanding that there are two ways to parse XML in a VB project: using either the Document Object Model (DOM) or Simple API for XML (SAX). The authors describe how to use the Microsoft XML parser (MSXML), and at the time this book was written, MSXML supported only the DOM. As of July 2000, however, it also supports SAX. Therefore, the text covers only MSXML's support of the DOM interface.<br />The editing of this book is sloppy, so it was a challenge to match the references in the text to what actually appears on the accompanying CD. Once I located the appropriate files, however, I did find it useful to work through the DOM examples. The SAX examples, though not supported by the MSXML at the time (I had to download a third-party tool to work through the examples) were useful insofar as I gained a clear understanding of the differences between manipulating XML using the DOM and SAX interfaces.<br />Once I mastered XML, I haven't found any need to reference this book again.	2000-10-28

Yet this book is a resource I turn to repeatedly.  I've learned so much in the way of basics from Deborah Madison, as well as many interesting new skills and techniques.   There's nothing fussy or pretentious in this book.  I've found her recipes to be rich and flavorful.  It's great to come home from the farmer's market and turn to this reference to discover, &quot;What can I make with these chiles or this eggplant that I just bought?&quot; Her recipes have many variations and adaptations, so that you can return to familiar favorites and experiment with them in a new way, using whatever ingredients you might happen to have on hand.<br />This book has made it even easier for me to be a vegetarian.  I've followed Deborah Madison for 10 years, ever since I first discovered her Greens restaurant in San Francisco.  It's been a joy to watch her grow as a cook and as an author, and to grow with her in my own greater commitment to vegetarianism and skill and experience as a cook.  This truly is a book of &quot;vegetarian cooking for everyone.&quot; It genuinely brings vegetarian cooking into the mainstream and makes it accessible for everyone.  You don't need to have access to exotic or hard-to-find ingredients to prepare the foods in this book.  It's a rich resource well worth the investment, for it will take me a long time to experiment with every recipe and variation in this book.  It's inspired my curiosity to try more vegetables and has led me to appreciate the abundance and bounty that exists in simple vegetables--so much so, that I feel no sacrifice in not eating meat.  Deborah Madison has helped cement a final step in my gradual path toward vegetarianism and has made it surprisingly simple to eat this way.  It's been a great pleasure to discover how many varied and rich ways one can eat the simple products of the earth.  A greasy hamburger pales in comparison to the treasures offered in this book.<br />You don't have to be a vegetarian, however, to appreciate this book, and the author isn't preachy about vegetarianism at all.  Rather than a collection of recipes, this is a book about discovery, experimentation, and growth in skill as a cook.	2000-10-28

The most ordinary errand can go bad ... There is an endemic apprehension of danger in the apparently benign.&quot; Joan Didion makes it possible to imagine living this way, every day, with no escape, surrounded by brutal evidence of violent torture and death everywhere.<br />By the end of Ms. Didion's narrative, it becomes evident, if the reader did not already have some inkling at the beginning, that &quot;American policy, by accepting the invention of 'communism,' as defined by the right in El Salvador, as a daemonic element to be opposed at even the most draconic cost, had in fact achieved the reverse.&quot; &quot;To the right, anyone in the opposition was a communist ... where 'left' may mean, in the beginning, only a resistance to seeing one's family killed or disappeared ... In other words 'anti-communism' was seen, correctly, as the bait the United States would always take.&quot;<br />Reading Ms. Didion's firsthand report of the two weeks she lived in El Salvador in 1982 has made me hungry for more details.  Her account is no ranting, &quot;liberal&quot; narrative, despite discussing a highly politically charged topic.  It seemed truly a dispassionate observation of a country's life and culture laid to waste--our tax dollars at work.  Truly cause for reflection on our government's--and our personal--role and effect on the lives of people with whom we share this earth.	2000-10-24

Love--that much misused and misinterpreted word--for them meant simply an overflowing of the strength with which they felt themselves filled when living in true self-oblivion. And this love found natural expression in an unhesitant fulfillment of duty and an unreserved acceptance of life, whatever it brought them personally of toil, suffering--or happiness.\\"<br />This is my favorite quote from the entire book, one to which I have returned many times over the years, but there are many more treasures to be found in this collection. W.H. Auden's foreword I found deeply insightful, and I have returned to it as well many times over the years. How to reconcile our twentieth-century life with what is truly asked of us, when we care to face those questions, is an overarching concern throughout this book. Time and again, Hammarskjold challenges himself, and by sharing in his spiritual struggles, we challenge ourselves as well by meditating on his reflections. His writing is deeply inspiring and sobering, and I feel a sense of grateful humility at the end of each rereading of it. This is a book to keep by your bedside, to turn to when you are in despair and need some soul-strengthening.	2000-10-11

The rhythm of his lonely, compassionate, and mystical voice in this work enraptured me.  The work concludes with the most profound and moving essay on friendship that I have ever read, one that far transcends his well-known fable &quot;The Little Prince.&quot; His reflections on loneliness will resonate with anyone who has struggled with not succumbing to despair, and who has instead found God and love and compassion at the far end of this struggle.  <br />Saint-Exupery weaves his great love for the vast, lonely, and empty Saharan desert of his youth that he crossed many times in the 1920s pioneering airmail routes for Air France with personal reflections and understandings of the Biblical mysteries that transpired in this same corner of the earth thousands of years ago.  He returned to the African desert in the last days of his life, where he was based as a P-38 reconnaisance pilot in a world that had turned ugly and that ultimately, I believe, broke his heart, based on the sad voice that resonates from these pages, one trying to make peace with the earth and with life before he dies.<br />This collection, along with Dag Hammarskjold's &quot;Markings,&quot; are my two favorite books, and both are very similar in nature though distinguished by their authors' personal voices and souls and writing style.  Both document the spiritual journeys of two lonely European men in this century in a very personal way.  Saint-Exupery's soulful reflections on the nature of love, friendship, loneliness, community, and duty are words I turn to again and again and that have grown with me through the years and acquired new meaning as I have matured.	2000-10-11

The best part of this novel is the prelude, written in the first person from the perspective of one its characters.  The prelude is highly credible and drew me into the story.  But then, suddenly, the perspective shifts.  The rest of the story is written in the third person.  Why this inexplicable shift?<br />The author is apparently unfamiliar with the maxim, &quot;Show, don't tell.&quot; He closes Chapter 6 with the explanation, &quot;Within 12 hours Superior would become the center of the universe,&quot; and lo and behold, Chapter 7 begins with the words, &quot;The invasion took less than 12 hours.&quot; Where's the suspense in that?  Why should anyone read further if the author informs you ahead of time what is going to happen?  Similarly, in Chapter 3, we're introduced to Wally, where we witness him eating his 747.  Then, in Chapter 4, we're supposed to pretend we haven't been witness to this scene, and we're supposed to share in J.J.'s questioning and ultimate incredulity that a man is eating a 747.  What for?  Why?<br />The characters lack credibility and depth.  Why, for example, would J.J. Smith announce that he is a recorder from The Book of Records and then act annoyed that the townspeople of Superior respond predictably to his presence?  If he is as travelworn as the author would have us believe, why doesn't he know better than to keep his identity incognito, or at least, not blurt it out as soon as he arrives in town?  Why would both he and Wally chase after a woman who is obviously not interested in either one of them?  Why would Willa be wearing her father's red cardigan on a hot summer day when the air conditioning is broken?  Would a 747 really crash gracefully and its pilots walk away unharmed and uncaring?  If Wally is eating the 747 to attract Willa's attention, why does he keep it a secret?  And anyway, it's not a secret: everyone in the town knows, but nobody cares. If nobody in Superior cares, why would the rest of the nation?  It's not even made clear in the first place why Wally is eating a 747; it's only implied from the book cover.<br />The only value I would suggest that one could gain from reading this novel is the realization that you, too, can write a novel.  It's a depressing read, not much more challenging than watching a television sitcom.  To see the way the nation is portrayed as getting utterly caught up in a Nebraska farmer's feat of eating a 747 by grinding it up and mixing it in with the ketchup on his hamburgers is ultimately depressing.

The author comes across as a very immature, self-centered woman posing as someone very modern, secular, cool and hip who doesn't really believe in all this medieval voodoo but who goes through the motions anyway so that she can do us the favor of giving us an &quot;inside look.&quot; The resulting prose, therefore, thoroughly lacks sincerity and credibility.  She seems to have one foot firmly planted in the secular world and the other foot very reluctantly planted in the seminary, whining through 200 or so pages why she has to do such tedious, meaningless, and apparently bewildering (to her) tasks as attend morning prayer.  <br />What comes across as insincerity perhaps might be an attempt on her part to be humorous and cute, judging from the reviews on the back cover that praise her sense of humor, but it still comes across as insincere.  There appear to be two Chloe Breyers in this story: the secular self skeptically witnessing the seminary student go through the motions, and the seminary student muddling through the fog and the haze of her own indecision and disbelief, seemingly bewildered as to how she ended up there.  Is the Episcopal seminary where Harvard would-be social activists end up in their attempt to one-up their peers who graduated with law and business degrees?  Several times the author describes her resentment and envy toward her peers who don't have to go through all this church-rigamarole in order to earn their livelihood and dispense good works to the little people who didn't go to Harvard and who live among the masses.  She comes across as someone desperately needy of approval who hopes that the stamp of God will be the gold star she's been waiting for in life.  Rather than responding to a calling, the author seems to shoulder her burden reluctantly as something she must do for the good of others.  She seems more concerned with dispensing Bible studies than with patiently ministering and listening to people in need.  She seems more like someone who wants to fix people rather than simply listen and help them find their own answers.  Too bad that attending daily morning prayer didn't teach her the value of listening to what comes out of the silence--which is sometimes &quot;nothing.&quot;<br />The author heaps lavish praise upon her numerous editors, but I found the editing wanting.  The frequent shifts between present and past tense are unnerving and interrupt the flow.  First she's remembering, then she switches to present tense so that &quot;you are there,&quot; then she flips back to past tense again.  Retelling her story in present tense had the opposite of the desired effect on me--rather than feeling more immersed in the story, I felt like an outsider as she retold her experiences in this unnatural voice.  A skilled writer doesn't need to write in the present tense to make the reader experience what the writer experienced herself.<br />Furthermore, the story is supposed to be about her first year as a seminary student, but in the chapter titled &quot;Easter,&quot; she launches into an embarrassing and long recounting of a &quot;civil disobedience&quot; stunt she pulled in her SECOND year.  And a stunt it is.  I was embarrassed and ashamed for her.  She is a self-described &quot;knee-jerk bleeding-heart liberal from Cambridge&quot; and not only does it show, but she seems proud of the label.  She pats herself on the back heartily for scheduling time to check herself into the police station and allow herself to get arrested, in the grandiose name of &quot;civil disobedience.&quot; But she's not about to allow herself to get arrested a second time and spend the night in Rikers, as the police warn the self-congratulating &quot;protesters&quot; will happen should they decide to repeat their staged act of &quot;defiance.&quot; What Ms. Breyer refers to as &quot;civil disobedience&quot; is an insult to the acts of integrity performed by Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and their followers.<br />The Episcopal church must be harder up for priests than the Catholic Church, despite allowing both men and women to be ordained.  If I gained anything from reading this memoir, it was the reaffirmation that a spiritual vocation requires the utmost commitment; it's not something one performs half-heartedly.  It's a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week LIFE.  As C. S. Lewis wrote, Jesus asks us to hand our ENTIRE selves over to Him--and He will give us a new self in return.  He asks, and it's a willing choice on our part--not the reluctant, begrudging burden Ms. Breyer would have us believe, or a suit that one must don in order to perform good works.	2000-09-22
US	51061909	R1P945Z9O0DLPE	1893732134	622141682	Not for Sale: Saving Your Soul and Your Sanity at Work	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Good suggestions for a beginner, but no in-depth exploration	This is a slim volume with lots of white space and cartoons.  Although I  could identify with many, if not all, of the work situations portrayed, I  didn't walk away with many &quot;concrete, practical suggestions,&quot; as  the back cover implied I would.  Basically, Mr. Elwood recommends making  prayer and scripture (or, I would add, spiritual) reading a part of your  daily routine, which I highly recommend also: I find that starting my day  by getting up early, reading a passage from the Bible and meditating on it,  and attending daily Mass before work all help center my day and provide me  with a spiritual foundation and focus--spiritual food for my mind for  breakfast.  <br />The notion that anyone might seek work--a commercially  oriented enterprise--to fulfill spiritual needs in the first place perhaps  suggests how work-oriented our culture truly is, as though work could  provide one-stop shopping for us and we could obviate the need to center  ourselves spiritually outside of work.  &quot;Give to Caesar what belongs  to Caesar, but give to God what belongs to God,&quot; Jesus said.  Perhaps  the focus should rather be on how we can enrich ourselves spiritually so  that we can bring that spirituality to work with us and thereby enrich our  work environment.  For to be &quot;spiritually aware&quot; is to be a  leader, and thus a giver and a cross-bearer--not a taker.  Why should we  expect that someone else--our boss or our coworkers or clients--should be  providing for our spiritual needs, as though work were intended to provide  this paternalistic function?<br />Mr. Elwood also recommends knowing who you  are and simplifying your lifestyle.  Certainly, by simplifying your  lifestyle, you are less likely to become addicted to your work as a means  of propping up a materialistic lifestyle.  And indeed, learning to know who  you are is an activity that must take place away from work; otherwise, you  risk becoming addicted to your work and identifying yourselfby your work  alone.  He does point out wisely that there is a difference between being  passionate about work you love, work to which you bring your spirituality  and that enriches your spirituality, and work that is addictive and drains  you of your spirituality, that seems at cross-purposes with your  spirituality.<br />If these suggestions are new to you, then I recommend  reading the book as a starting point.  If, however, you already practice  these suggestions, you might seek something meatier, as it will only  reinforce what you already know to be true and effective.	2000-09-15
US	51061909	RBAK3448I5TY6	0802111823	768591766	Chloe and Olivia	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A forerunner in women's literature	I discovered this book via the recommendation of another author, Barbara  Kingsolver.  She refers to it as one of the &quot;beautifully written first  novels published each year that sell a handful of copies and quietly go out  of print.&quot; Although the characters in this book did not completely  resonate with me, I would still encourage you to purchase an out-of-print  copy of this book.  Why?  I personally found it intriguing that Ms.  Chevigny created an entire novel based on a single quote from Virginia  Woolf's &quot;A Room of One's Own,&quot; in which she wondered what a novel  would be like if the writer had the confidence and art to do justice to the  subject of friendship between women:<br />&quot;'Chloe like Olivia,' I read.  And then it struck me how immense a change was there.  Chloe liked Olivia  perhaps for the first time in literature.&quot;<br />The story is about a  friendship between two women who take different paths in life between 1961  and 1975 but who manage to remain spiritually and emotionally close.  How  they do so is the essence of the story.  And while I found it difficult to  relate to these two women personally, I felt that Ms. Chevigny did an  excellent job of capturing the ebbs and flows, the sometimes reluctance and  tension and struggle to communicate over distance and time between two  friends, but how, despite time and distance and different experiences, all  the words and emotions can come tumbling out and the essence that binds two  people together still remains, and the intensity is recreated again and  again.<br />Read this book.  It will encourage you to reflect on your own  friendships and relationships and how they have grown and endured over  time.  I myself am eager to read more work by Ms. Chevigny.	2000-09-15
