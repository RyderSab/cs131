A diehard liberal and a political fanatic, someone whose views would normally make me sneer and scoff, Stephanopolous paints a picture of the stresses, ins-and-outs, spin, activities and the vital scope of the world inside the Oval Office. Every newsworthy event or program is canvassed for its political ramafications; the very definition and refinement of the word \\"politics\\" is reinforced on every page; the mistakes that lead to triumphs, and the feel-good preparations that lead to disasters are all here in stark detail. Stephanopolous proves himself a very sensible man, and even his staunchly liberal views are sidenotes to the greater energies, arguments and preparations that occur inside the White House. I occasionally disliked S's speaking his own platform (which he did sparingly), or telling how political parties are constructed to blunt the other even when their plans are sensible, but all in all I learned more from this book about the workings inside the White House than from all my prior readings and public education.	2005-10-12

From there he proceeds to describe the major decisions and complexion of the Court in their historical context, examining details or events where applicable that might have made the Court decide as it did. In very few places Rehnquist adds his own opinion but he keeps these very short and vague (as if not willing to downcast a fellow Justice). After reaching the 1970s with his history, Rehnquist describes the actual processses of certiorari, the conferences leading to a Supreme Court decision, how the advocates before the Court should argue their cases, and finally how the opinions are finally written and how shared among the justices before being \\"handed down.\\" He essentially finishes with a few canons regarding how the Supreme Court should function and praise regarding how it has discharged its function for two centuries. For many unfamiliar with a general history of the United States, this book about the judicial branch of our government is a good source of information. For lawyers interested in how the Supreme Court actually does its work, the final chapters should be of interest. Rehnquist does not re-examine facts or laws in most cases, but at times he suggests that the Court's behavior was not as rational as it might have been. In sum, Rehnquists shows himself to be an able story-teller, fairly lucid in his arguments, devoted to his subject (the history and everyday workings of the Court), and credible as a historian.	2005-09-14

For me it has helped changed perceptions of acts and agencies of our federal government. The books gives a chronological portrayal of the Bureau's early days to the present, and finishes with a few chapters of important cases (espionage, 9/11 and others) that were too significant to put in mere historical context. For the most part Kessler's arguments and research are highly credible. His description of the Bureau over the last 15 years matches my personal recollection of certain events and my own perceptions regarding the Bureau, and how certain attitudes, dogmas or rules \\"handed down\\" by the Director were responsible for Bureau mistakes or public perceptions of the agency. <br /> <br />At times one might view Kessler's work as an attack on the Bureau, but the book seems admirably weighed between censure for the Bureau's wrongdoing and praise for the Bureau's successes. This balance makes the book more credible, and the reader's own understanding of human nature make most of the descriptions herein very plausible. In all, a very strong presentation of the Bureau, both good and bad.	2005-09-14

I found the reviews to be supportive of the work with grave reservations, and I found this to be my opinion when finished with the reading. <br /> <br />The book's beginning chapter speaks in detail of Hughes' last days, his dependence on drugs for pain relief, and his tight-knit entourage of staff who ministered to his final hours. This structure provides us a clear idea of how the remaining book will evolve without bogging us down with detail as Hughes reaches his final minutes. <br /> <br />For the first 100 pages I found the book difficult to put down but soon enough I read it no faster than any other. Hack is clearly an organized and thoughtful writer, but his style in my opinion is too similar to that of Joseph Wambaugh. Both men are too apt to use ridiculous similes in telling their tale. In Wambaugh's case the practice smacks of one cop chuckling over a bloody crime with other cops (seemingly his audience when writing his books). In Hack's case the similes distract from the overall tenor so much that the average reader might be quick to question his research and presentation. Early on I forgave such phrases as \\"piggybacked like barbary macaques in the jungles of Algeria . .\\" (not one of which elements belongs in this book). \\"Banks folding like concertinas\\" was forgivable. The other samples I jotted down were but a few of a large number. . .\\"he worked with the intensity that old maids give to picking locks. . . \\"; \\"love was as alien to him as a jelly doughnut to a Slovakian rebel. . .\\"; Maheu \\"clung to office like a sheet of Saran wrap on a cold bowl. . \\"; [that they might] \\". . fight among themselves like alley cats over rotting garbage. . .\\" In many instances the entire page was peppered with the silliest similes and metaphors that I seriously wondered how I could read the remaining pages. <br /> <br />On the whole, the latest reviews are probably just. The bookspeaks devotedly of its subject, and this is the deteriorating man known as Howard Hughes. The mystique is stripped; the bare tax (and bare ass, as often as not) is revealed. This biography was by no means the page-turner it seemed it would be, but it seems credible in its treatment of its subject.	2005-09-08

Unlike his other works where his style is plain and forthright, here one suspects him almost of tilting a bottle while he recalls the best and worst of Guadalcanal. Too often the book reads as if Leckie had written it overnight for his surviving comrades also stationed on the island; the endnotes are plagued with citations reading \\"author's recollection.\\" Some of these personal reflections are obviously important to the historical fabric of Guadalcanal, but Leckie's style in this particular work seems to speak to a very finite specific audience rather than the general public. On the one hand I felt as if we were there during the conflict, and on the other I felt like a wastrel and misfit hoping the whole thing was over.	2005-08-04

The earliest chapters of this remarkable book deal with the actual history of the planet we call Earth and the rudiments and development of early life. Afterward the book tells a fairly succinct story of the Dawn of Time and the lifestyles and development of early hominids leading up to and including Man. Once Wells reaches periods of written history, the story bogs down while he attempts to cover the rise of early cities, political and economic development, and early empires, which he does fairly ably though switching back and forth between the histories of individual continents is somewhat tedious. Wells speaks of the development of early religion and early communities in a very cogent, convincing and interesting way, but the disjointed concurrent treatment of ongoing empires (China, India, Rome, Egypt, Greece, etc) tends to choke and even halt the fluid style as we try to catch up on coexisting cultures around the globe. South America, Antarctica, and Australia are almost nonexistent in this book as Wells reconstructs the history of Europe, Asia and to a lesser extent, Africa. Still a very enjoyable and highly informative book.	2005-08-04

Of the 13 firemen who responded to the WTC disaster from this station, 12 were killed, the 13th critically injured. The book introduces us almost in the first pages to most of these men, exploring their private and firehouse lives from their first years in the department. Though some of the 12 are not introduced until after the disaster has been recounted in various ways, the story is poignant, personal, moving and very real in its treatment of actual and ordinary men facing extraordinary conditions on 9/11. An easy-to-read, hard-to-put-down account, this is recommended reading to all who still feel the pain of 9/11.	2005-08-04

While both are required to check their facts for accuracy, the journalist permits personal opinion and argument to fill in all the holes, something to make the historian dissociate himself from friends in the press. <br /> <br />Let me quote two arguments in the book. \\"Democracies may well remain peace loving only so long as the risks of war remain real to their citizens.\\" (p. 179) \\"We keep waging war, not because we want to, but because we have seeded a doubt about our seriousness which only a concerted display of violence. . can eradicate.\\" (p. 205) <br /> <br />If these sentiments seem cogent, this book is for you. <br /> <br />The ex-Yugoslavia is past stomping grounds for Ignatieff, so the conflicts here are dear to his heart. He blames the massacres in Bosnia on \\"Presidential inaction\\" rather than on local warlords. His take on Kosovo was to prescribe immediate militarization but then to blame ministers and presidents for side-stepping legislatures and to proceed without UN mandates for this militarization. He calls the bombing of Baghdad in the Gulf War \\"a light show\\" and the bombing campaign a \\"video-arcade game.\\" This idea was the darling of the press in 1991, but the notion is a direct affront to alliance pilots who needed only to look out their windows to see anti-aircraft fire trying to shoot them down. Ignatieff himself speaks of NATO pilots being forced to fly above 15,000 ft and feeling the concussions of near-misses from anti-aircraft fire. Are such realities like a \\"video-arcade game?\\" Ignatieff ignores this to paint his warped notion of a \\"virtual\\" war. <br /> <br />Ignatieff demanded intervention for Kosovo but then blames how it was carried out. He says the laser-guided bombing was ineffective in stopping Milosevic and so it was. He says how \\"virtual war\\" is virtual both to the people dropping the ordnance and those fleeing the bombs. To quote one pilotabout Iraq's \\"no-fly zone\\" who said that the occasional anti-aircraft shot was the sole thing that reminded him he was \\"at war\\" (i.e. a \\"virtual\\" notion). Ignatieff fails to realize that once the coalition dominated the skies and knocked out dozens of SAM sites that shots from below were likely to die down. He says of \\"virtual warfare's victims\\" that the occasion is like a \\"spectator sport\\" (out of the minds and hearts of democracies), something worthy to commemorate by \\"buying a postcard.\\" <br /> <br />On the whole Ignatieff states a case and then contradicts or refutes himself earlier or later. His rationale is consistent only in isolation. The more he enlarges on his views, the deeper the hole he digs for himself. <br /> <br />This book is not about technology or the way the military fights modern war (per se). It's about disliking fewer casualities, disliking sophisticated weapons, disliking the detachment of commanders and soldiers who are now engaged only at the perimeter, and so on and so on. Pyrhhus and MacArthur and all history's other commanders would gladly tell Ignatieff (who eventually tells himself) that inflicting hurt on the other army without receiving ourselves is only proper tactics. Pity Ignatieff cannot have all wars be his way.	2005-07-19

Obviously no better source exists on Washington's thoughts than these, and in this regard Randall fairly interprets the writings without bias or misconstruction. Washington's early campaigns as an English-officer-wannabe and his early courtship of Martha Dandridge are poignantly human, but once the Revolution begins, Washington almost drops from the text. Only sparingly do we see Washington the man during these 8 years, but rather the results of Washington the military commander (something retold in countless histories and biographies). Once President, Randall tells us too little of Washington's influence on the unprecedented office of Chief Executive and its relationships with Congress and foreign powers, something vitally important to American History. Overall, the first half of this biography tells a clear picture from Washington's own thoughts and ideas, but fails to follow this precept in the second half. Throughout the book, Randall appends lengthy phrases between his subject and verb (sentence-ending verbs), much like the 18th-century correspondence he followed (a common practice then, but tiresome and objectionable in this book). On the whole, the work bogs down in its subject matter and its semantics, becomes tedious in the reading and arguably fails to deliver on &quot;a life&quot; so promised.	2003-10-22

For one thing, the author gives Poirot an ascendant over the supposedly-expert medical examiner on board the train, making the doctor second guess himself a little too often (a nationality bias on Christie's part). Second, the victim is a hated man, making the murder less sensational, but the fact that the train is snowbound and that no one can escape the Express makes for a less-than-exciting notion that the killer is still on board (though everyone acts as if under sedation during their &quot;enforced captivity&quot;). As the mystery is unraveled, the entire truth appears on the instant,  abruptly ending any suspense. This is my 2nd Christie mystery after &quot;Death on the Nile,&quot; a much more gripping book.	2003-08-20

During his administration, his principles and acts were either thwarted by a bungling 13th Congress, or superseded by an energetic 14th Congress. As well (according to Adams) this was the last age in which ambassadors and envoys carried so much weight in the administration. Afterwards the Congress became the premier power in the United States, with ambassadors playing important but less conspicuous roles, and the President becoming less of a political force. In the first 400 pages, Adams painstakingly describes the diplomatic engagements that embroiled us into a war with England and France, and then brilliantly describes the naval and land battles that occurred during the War of 1812. After Washington was burned (for which Madison was jeered and vilified when passing from village to village), the United States broke into an economic vitality not known before (which tended to make the public forget the burning of Washington). Massachusetts, which had threatened secession with Connecticut and Rhode Island, was humbled by the new Republican Treasurer, whose autocratic policies helped to reduce one state's superiority over another. An interesting and energetic portrayal of life in early America, and the sudden maturation process of our diplomatic and economic infancy.	2003-08-20

Though his reasoning and conclusions may alarm some and even offend others, his thinking and writing is lucid and cogent, and for reflective minds will provide much food for thought. Accused of sophistry and impudence by some of his contemporaries, his reasoning is normally sound and simple, as he inquires into the root of things, and only seldom does he make debating points fit only for the playground. A sensible and likable man, Paine's writing should engage any American for its historical sense, any lover or researcher interested in human rights and the hope of removing human misery, and any person interested in reading the entertaining but vital arguments of a man whose love of liberty and order forced him late in life to become one of America's most influential revolutionary and socially-minded voices.	2003-05-26

Politics, the maker of strange bedfellows, and a background as broad and as varied as Russia itself, make for key components in this fascinating examination of political theory and efforts at self-government on the heels of the First World War.	2003-04-05

Though Pringle ably exposes Roosevelt's political theories and doctrines and their strange inceptions, the presentation of the book tediously presents a few details, then gives Roosevelt's reaction, then a new set of details, then Roosevelt's reaction, ad infinitum.

What began as a memoir on his early childhood and his enlistment in the navy quickly becomes what appears to be just an insider's description of the Imperial Navy, the aftermath of WWI and the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, the need for Germany to protect itself against France and Poland, and various other fronts which Raeder tediously presents before the reader. Toward the middle of the book and following to the back cover, Raeder continues to bring up Nuremberg, when you truly get the idea that this book was more an explanation than a history, more a document to counter the Allied perspective than a memoir, and more a tedious legal defense than an engaging history. As the Grand Admiral of the Navy, Raeder's perspective is significant to a comprehensive reading about the war, yet his effort falls in the same barrel as the inept rendition by Patton (War As I Knew It).	2003-04-05

From the first pages where he describes the America over which Jefferson presided, Adams clearly defines idealogies and principles as they were defended and practiced by the Federalists and Republicans of the day. Throughout Jefferson's two terms, the president was forced to abandon favorite principles and to defend others that were ulimately (if not immediately) untenable. Through skillful hands we watch how moods changed and policies switched, and how the main characters attempted to reconcile their inconsistencies. Jefferson hoped to expose the wrongfulness of Federalist policies, yet wound up forwarding the same tenets in his management. The President who rose to such a height of popularity and power left the office as disgraced and as generally disliked as any Chief Executive before or after. A masterful work about eight important and formative years in the early republic.	2003-01-27

Instead, the overall weight of the book is given to glaciers, their descriptions, their influence on the landscape, their geological record, the discovery of new glaciers, and other characteristics of these moving rivers of ice. While Muir offers descriptive powers unequaled among authors on nature, never repeating himself though constantly repeating his subject, the sheer repetition tends to bog the work down. Two whole pages might contribute to our view of a particular glacier, and suddenly Muir reports that he's finished a 200-mile leg of his journey on foot. He tells us when he's climbed a glacier, and along the way we've missed an entire week. Time and space almost have no medium in this publication, utterly lost when gazing upon a glacier. For nature lovers who will never go to Alaska, the descriptions in this book make the ranges and glaciers come alive in print, but as a dramatic journey, a travelogue, or a field manual for the Alaskan bush, this book forms only a vague shadow.	2002-10-29

Taking over at West Point in 1919, his book begins to expose particular weaknesses in American idealogy when it comes to the \\"expense of defense.\\" As MacArthur continued his tale, I could scarcely trust my eyes. In WWII, the Pacific theater had no unified command like Europe and other theaters. MacArthur controlled only part of his forces; those not under his command were oftentimes pulled away on other missions, sometimes at the last moment. For a time he enjoyed command over his own air power, but later he lost this luxury as other missions took precedence. MacArthur's tactics and strategy are always clearly defined and easily acceptable as intelligent courses. His hope and duty to protect his men appears on every page. His objections to frontal assaults on what he termed \\"militarily insignificant\\" objectives (both to the Allies and to Japan) on Okinawa and Iwo Jima made me groan anew for the men we lost there. \\"Only poor commanders turn in large casualties\\" he wrote. His masterly reconstruction of Japan (1945-50) shows his open and fair concepts of what we now call \\"nation building.\\" He knew that the reconstruction and reforms would not succeed unless authorized by the people of Japan. Shouts of rage greeted him in 1945 when he entered Tokyo; tears of sorrow witnessed his departure. In Korea, my stomach turned on almost every page, as Mac describes the indecision or timidity that put men in harm's way without a clear objective, without support, and without even the formal declaration of war. The \\"police action\\" as Truman insisted it was seemed to Mac (and to any reader or soldier) as actual war, yet the more acceptable phrase continues to be repeated today. Persons who think so today should read this book and reconsider. For instance, the mass murder in Bosnia in the 1990s was diabolically reduced to \\"ethnic cleansing.\\" In the 1940s we called this \\"extermination.\\" When the concentration camps ran full speed in Poland in 1945, the German clerks merely wrote \\"released\\" whenever they bothered to record names. This book gives a heroic picture of American military might and the idealogy of freedom, but also a horrid picture of inaction and misinformed policy, and a glimpse behind a curtain of US Government-propagated disinformation.e 1990s was diabolically reduced to \\"ethnic cleansing.\\" In the 1940s we called this \\"extermination.\\" When the concentration camps ran full speed in Poland in 1945, the German clerks merely wrote \\"released\\" whenever they bothered to record names.

As a travel documentary and expedition, the account is vivid with the joy of the men after the dreary weeks on the Great Plains when they catch their first glimpse of the Rockies. When food sources run low, the drama intensifies. Altogether the expedition shares many of the fates of the Lewis and Clark expedition, with desertion, hungry, half and then quarter rations, and the loss of equipment and documentation, the account is too specific and at length on a too broad range of subjects. While I had hoped to read more about the men's impression of new places and scenes, the journal leans more toward the classification of plants, flowers and small animals. After all this was a scientific expedition like Lewis and Clark's, but the digressions on plant and animal life make the &quot;expedition's&quot; journal somewhat suffer.	2002-09-26

The reader must read carefully through the first fifth of the book to avoid confusing names and relationships, but ultimately the actors are well defined. Every conversation or statement from the main characters is routinely cited from firsthand accounts. The book includes an extensive bibliography and a biography of dozens of characters in the upper echelons of the Nazi military, SS and civil bureaucracy. Reitlinger weaves a remarkable tapestry of places, names and events until we have a better understanding of the inner workings of the Nazi government, their secret orders of exterminating Jews and Slavs and other \\"sub-human\\" races, the often public denials of the concentration camps by members of the highest rank, the contests for power under Hitler, and the seductions and betrayals between officers and agents(like a nest of vipers) at the heart of the German Reich. An important scholarly addition to any WWII library, this book details the most insidious plots and conversations among history's most brutal mass murderers, the corruption of their officers, and the incredible processes of armies within armies, states within the state, and secret intelligence forces within the police and other ministries.<br />Well-written, consise, and highly credible.	2002-05-15

Like everyone else in the Nazi apparatus, he had to watch his back or look over his shoulder at every turn, since blackmail was common throughout the Nazi organization.<br />Despite this, Schellenberg was a patriot, and thrust into a mutating Germany on the brink of world war, he worked diligently from a patriotic side to assist in bringing victory to his country, or later, when defeat seemed inevitable, in sending out feelers for peace.<br />The recruitment of agents, the development of the secret service branches, the search for new efficiencies, and the discovered betrayal of old friends fill the book. Schellenberg compares foreign secret service agencies and highlights their accuracy and methods, showing where Germany was able to dupe the English and where the Russians were getting too pertinent information. Most revealing perhaps in this book are the personalities of the Nazi leadership, specifically Heydrich and Himmler, but sometimes Hitler. He worked with these men daily, and sometimes against their direct intervention, sometimes with their lukewarm approval, Schellenberg managed to maintain his office as efficiently as the circumstances allowed.<br />An intriguing look at life behind the scenes of military intelligence and secret service work.	2002-04-25

As a whole, this work is disjointed and picaresque. There are a great number of Pattonisms here though which pique the reader for the more notorious and famous episodes in the general's bright career.

He gives the state of our preparedness, discusses the able officers who were headed to develop our forces, and describes episodes that changed our training and effectiveness. He meets daily with the major players and heads of state and gives glimpses of their personalities as well as their views. He discusses where politics and the military overlap and where damages might occur. He discusses strategy and tactics and carefully distinguishes for the reader the differences. He clearly demonstrates pitfalls and purposes in the practice and preparation and execution of a successful war. From top to bottom along the line, he explains stresses on commander as well as enlisted troops, such as confidence and morale among other aspects. Throughout the book we gain confidence in Eisenhower's easy, open style, his sincerity and his trustworthiness.

As well, the author gives a great deal of background on the manufacturers, the competition for the new air speed record, the celebrated pilots who tested the new marvels, the hardships of restricted supply, the motives and explanations of the awarding of production contracts, and many more insights into the German Luftwaffe from its inception, and from the ground up.

Instead, he merely provides sketches of the important conspirators, gives some background, explains their part in the plot to kill Hitler or coax the West to support an overthrow of the Nazis, and explains that the conspirators either escaped the ensuing manhunts after July 20, 1944, or that they were tortured and executed. He provides a short description of how the Church was reduced to passive resistance, how the Germans might have chosen the East for salvation rather than the West, and how even Himmler and Goring aspired to step into the Fuhrer's shoes. The book is a mere skeleton of information found in greater detail in other books, especially Hans Gisevius &quot;To the Bitter End.&quot; If you need your books brief and to read like outlines, this will serve.

The first fifth of the book passes through a dream-like state while sweeping and surreptitious changes take place in the police forces, the national government, the propaganda movements, the press, the ministries, the military. This book presents things about Germany that are normally not considered. Most Americans probably think that Germany was an idealistic war machine in the 1940s: with one mind, one head, one purpose. Not so. The author begins in 1933 as a new attache in the newly-formed Gestapo. Immediately things begin to go awry. New changes come down, rumors abound, mistrust fosters mistrust. In his own building and everyday workplace, his own boss tells him to take the staircase at the wall-side rather than near the railing, as this would expose him to sniper fire from a vantage point higher in the stairwell. No one walks across the hall to clean his face without phoning a colleague on such a &quot;dangerous enterprise.&quot; After these initial scenes, the author travels &quot;outside&quot; of government circles but remains in close contact with the major players plotting to overthrow the Fuehrer. He recounts across the years how the church was subdued, how the German people were &quot;assisted&quot; in imagining that things were working out, that propaganda helped to pave the way for even greater excesses, even how the generals were quailed (these last were long thought to be the last hope). The book is terrific in that it follows an agent in actual work, sifting through facts, talking clandestinely with associates, plotting an important life-or-death struggle to overthrow the Monster. Never knowing who to trust, never knowing what is coming next, never knowing when the bullet will come -- these are momentous and continuing features with which we have to deal. That the author survived as early as 1934 is remarkable. That he lived through the failed assassination attempt and the subsequent purges is incredible. A must read for WWIIbuffs, this highly readable text is a testament to those Germans working for sound government, healthy industry and a stable German society. An excellent book!	2001-09-09

Comprehensive and concise, frank but fair, there are few books on history more dramatic than this. The overwhelming importance of the event would demand nothing less. You will find yourself cheering the industry of the besieged, suffering a grim hopelessness that the inevitable press will crush the city, and finally, you will appreciate what the generals on both sides think, hear their commands, and follow the consequences.

The Western Marches had not yet been subdued by English authority, and clouds of banditti continue to make inroads into English territory. Our characters are besieged in a castle that only at the moment of crisis is it put into a posture of defense to withstand the siege. A phlegmatic Fleming and his daughter form the sensible counters to the hot-blooded English family who owns the castle. Intrigues and sorcery (the product of the times), conflicts between religion, the foreign wars, infighting within the family (when a son would murder his father for his possessions) all have equal place here. A fascinating glimpse of the times, and a highly readable story make this yet another jewel in Scott's wonderful body of historical fiction.	2001-09-02

Mingling with foreigners and Europeans specifically, his caustic wit centers on contrast and comparison between the Old and New World, the feature of all of Twain's books. While it is sometimes difficult to divide Twain the traveler from Twain the critic, his remarks are frequently informative as his new eyes are brought to old scenes, and his criticisms (as usual) are incisive and clever. Tangiers, Naples, Constantinople, Alexandria, Cairo -- these are but a few of the places he visits. As a traveler myself, I have often cited Twain's views in comparison or contrast with my own findings, such as his detestation for Turkish coffee (he hated it, but it was almost tasteless to me). In any event, Twain returns home safely after a long voyage to many places, where his tongue had given frequent lashings to the Old World, the Middle East and even his fellow travelers.	2001-09-02

The hardships of the settlers due to the ruggedness of their new mountain home, their self-reliance, the cold winters, the need to fell forest for pasture and tillage, the daily peril of Indian attacks, and the distant relations with their origins to the east complete this wonderfully written and diversified study of early American frontier life.	2001-08-25

While it would be improper to say that Roosevelt strictly confined his second volume to the little details, every page seems to resound with the latest Indian skirmish, a gruesome tomahawking, a white foray or retaliation, and the daily peril of Indian attacks. The American Revolution finds frequent appearance as the guiding backdrop to this volume, with the result being the repeated treatments of the British encouraging the Indians (through payments and promises) to set upon the American settlers. Overall a more specific volume than the first, I left the book thinking the whole nothing but an endless series of Indian battles.	2001-08-25

Different scenes require the detail that the author provides, but other infusions of tedious facts slow down an already slow story. Clancy crushes us into submission by explaining to us in too much detail that he has obviously read too many books.    A few examples of the task of reading Red October. The first two paragraphs are excerpts from the book, while the third, my own creation, rams my point home.    (1)&quot;Today the inside valve war closed, along with the corresponding through-hull fitting. The valves were made of titanium because they had to function reliably after prolonged exposure to high temperature, and also because titanium war very corrosion-resistant high-temperature water war murderously corrosive. What had not been fully considered war that the metal war also exposed to intense nuclear radiation, and this particular titanium alloy war not completely stable under extended neutron bombardment. The metal had become brittle over the years. The minute waves of hydraulic pressure were beating against the clapper in the valve. As the pump's frequency of vibration changed it began to approach the frequency at which the clapper vibrated. This caused the clapper to snap harder and harder against its retaining ring. The metal at its edges began to crack....    (2)&quot;In the reactor spaces aft, Lieutenant Butler had his engine men acknowledge the command and gave the necessary orders The reactor coolant pumps went to fast speed. An increased amount of hot, pressurized water entered the exchanger, where its heat war transferred to the steal on the outside loop. When the coolant returned to the reactor it was cooler than it had been and therefore denser. Being denser, it trapped more neutrons in the reactor pile, increasing the ferocity of the fission reaction and giving off yet more power. Farther aft, saturated steam in the &quot;outside&quot; or nonradioactive loop of the heat exchange system emerged through clusters of control valves to strike the blades of the high-pressure turbine. The Dallas' huge bronze screw began to turn more quickly, driving her forward and down...       (3, my own)&quot;It had been a long day, and Ryan needed to stay on top of it, which meant more black coffee. The coffee-making unit had a swivel compartment which opened for the insertion of a No 2 paper filter, filled with enough grounds for as many as ten cups of coffee. Once secure, closing the circuit caused heating coils under the decanter to expand and grow hotter, while internally-heated water descended through the grounds contained in the coffee basin, falling into the decanter as hot coffee....    Conclusion: There are several moments of excitement in Red October , and the characters are beautifully portrayed, but unfortunately, hours of tedium have to be survived by the reader If it weren't for the book, we might have been able to enjoy the story. Upon further reflection, the story wasn't that good either.    The story in itself is quite interesting and thoroughly researched, and this is the fundamental problem. The book opens with the decision to head west from the Norwegian Sea, and ever reader is easily convinced of its potential success and its absolute provocation. The reader is introduced to the vessel and its confident skipper, and the story gets underway smoothly.    Not before long, the reader finds himself consumed in page after page of government arguments and actions in both Washington and Moscow. Certainly this is for &quot;real&quot; historical procedure. However, the reader instantly feels the tedium while these talks continue, falling prey to the boredom which these government officials themselves must have felt at the same instant. Whether this is done for effect, there is no telling, but the result is to stifle the initial action, and therefore, the plot.  The reader is introduced to a score of minor characters who play a small one-time role, yet weare forced to know their entire dossiers. The constant jump back to historic facts is difficult to overcome when there is already a huge labyrinth of loose ends in front of us. After all the detail of these proceedings, and the detail of the minor events alone the way (those that have very little weight in the overall drama), we have world-class dyspepsia in our bowels.    Finally, the reader is reacquainted with the Russian vessel, and is allowed to follow its actions once again, after mercilessly being diverted from it. After an exciting final chase, covered quite dexterously from ship to ship by the author, the reader is liberated from the remorseless detail of earlier passages, and is free to choose whether or not the outcome was worth the price it required.    But then, what of other stories in Red October? Spies are left hanging in Moscow, and there is talk of removing them from the country; a Soviet sailor is left in a hospital bed who we must assume will recover (a fact which is covered at length, except his recovery); certain salvage operations are discussed and explained but neglected; after the October's crew is returned safely, a possible Soviet counter-operation is only &quot;discussed&quot; in Moscow; and two Soviet vessels (the Konovalov and the Shabilikov-p.403) stay behind to sink the October yet only one is destroyed (the Konovalov , but still another unidentified ship is left after a total recall of all others from the Atlantic, p.418); what are the fates of these?    In sum, the many interruptions were not cleared up satisfactorily, the level of detail was oppressive too often, and the real chase and excitement of the book were much underplayed. I would have to say that there was a good chance here for a great book, yet Tom Clancy did not deliver it on his first try out.	2001-08-05

However, this is the only true-crime book in his repertoire where he keeps in mind that a crime has been committed. The reason why? The victims were cops.<br />Notwithstanding this detail, which takes nothing from the horrid crime and the pain to the victims' families, Wambaugh never downplays the brutality of the case (in respect to his fellow officers) while the criminals in this case he duly brings to justice, if it can be called justice.<br />Two instances in the book represent Wambaugh's attention to detail, yet they give nothing to the character of either the cops/victims or the criminals. The fact that the detail appears also in the film (which Wambaugh scripted) demonstrates the immaturity of the man. One of the criminals has sex with his partner's girlfriend just before the other's arrival, and our culprit sniffs the air to gauge his probability of detection. Of the two police together, they wrestle down a gorilla of a man brought in for booking, and afterwards show a little of that macho party spirit, that in the end they had been victorious -- the perp was also gay.<br />If you can avoid Wambaugh's actual personality, the book is a compelling work of presenting a horrible crime and its aftermath. If you can stomach any of his other &quot;true-crime&quot; books, give serious reflection to his Wambaugh's handling of things in this one.	2001-07-18

Instead, as always, the book is replete with charming one-liners over the detective work and the continuation of the case history. Genetic finger-printing, &quot;the Blooding,&quot; details the forensics of finding the true killer through DNA analysis. Meanwhile, Wambaugh has his host of private chuckles, as a policeman story-teller sharing jokes among his readership (as if the book was intended for policemen friends). A recluse in the book &quot;has been harder to reach than Marlon Brando.&quot; The amount of film used to document all aspects of the case has involved &quot;a trainload.&quot; Among the hundreds of townies analysed by the forensics procedure, Wambaugh says &quot;more English blood had been spilled than on the Somme,&quot; a WWI battle that claimed a mere million fatalities. When documentation takes such a tenor, I wonder at the truth of his other statements, and whether the true spirit of all detective work is to find the laughter in the thing.<br />Finally, Wambaugh's own personality splits into a spokesman as well as policeman, when he makes an uncharacteristically compassionate remark that a tragedy had occurred at all. This sensitivity to an actual crime unfortunately stands alone throughout the book, as the rest of the writing provides a mocking parade of the facts.	2001-07-14

You need not watch carefully to see how the book is overwhelmingly written in the eyes of the detectives and the police, rather than from a kaleidoscope of impressions. A murder occurs; a parade of ridiculous associates, colleagues, neighbors and suspects appears before the viewer. The natural disgust of the detectives over such warped psyches provides the bulk of the reading, and the reader starts to forget that a murder has occurred, almost including Wambaugh, who chuckles with his heroes the police as we all laugh at the insanity of the victim's circle of friends and co-workers.<br />Suddenly, Wambaugh remembers himself, and recalls his readership to the murder, by getting a lucky break on a clue. This true case became one of the longest and most documented murder cases in the Northeast, yet Wambaugh instead rather enjoys the chaos, and obviously relishes being a part (as the author) of the detectives' sorting through the mish-mush. In short, to disdain and mock the weak individuals in the story seems more impressive to the writer's eye, than to find the actual perpetrator among such a vast parade of dreary suspects.<br />Human, Wambaugh is not; policeman, Wambaugh is.	2001-07-14

While Sulitzer too commonly weighs his books with sexual content, its appearance here finds perfect harmony in the physical and spiritual power of wealth among its several characters, as a vital component of Klimrod's sheer will.<br />A human book as well, with Klimrod's struggle with his emotions, his ambitions, his beliefs and his dreams, all are quite human in their embrace.<br />This book satisfies on a number of levels. An excellent read, a great translation, and a considerable testimonial of human effort. 5 stars is only an understatement - a wonderful book.	2001-07-14

Important characters (so familiar to those times) enter our stage without introduction, and after dropping famous hints, or carrying off some great exploit, are discarded without subsequent investigation. In short, Burnet touches lightly on the events and main players of each year from 1660-1712, but scarcely troubles himself to round out his topics, or give life to his characters. As he himself says, he only writes on areas where he was a key witness, but doesn't enlarge on events which most likely would appear in other history books.<br />After reading Hume or Macaulay, Burnet's writings seem almost useless.  An important figure of the times, it is difficult to conceive how this volume figures as an important journal of the times, yet for its defense, we are told that Swift owned a copy.	2001-07-10

Unfortunately, Scott intertwines character after character, culminating in the imprisonment of Mary Queen of Scots in the island fortress of Lochleven. Her isolation and imprisonment, the episodes of her supporters and admirers, the strong aversion to Popery now gaining everywhere but especially in Scotland, and the side which Roland, a secret but doubting Catholic raised in the Protestant manor of Avenel, will take, either the side of his patron Murray, or the lawful but deposed Catholic Queen of Scots, all distract the attention of the reader until a fairly satisfying but long-delayed ending.<br />The ends may justify the means, but the tedium of so many tiresome dialogues, and so many major and minor intrigues, give a troubling weight to this book which is difficult to justify.	2001-05-15

The first volumes relate the reign of James II, and the final volumes the reign of William III.<br />Macaulay is unlike other historians. His wit and humanity appeal to the taste of the most hardened readers in every chapter. He ridicules where necessary, debates where necessary, and extols where necessary. He spends time with his readers to allow us to understand 17th century England -- what composed a country squire, why towns were powerful, how politicians canvassed their districts, how the nation regarded certain topics -- religion, the monarchy, the free state, the standing army, certain taxes, the antipathy to France, etc.<br />Because the panorama is quite dense with important issues and debates, statistical information on parliamentary voting sometimes will tax the reader, but I found little in his volumes that did not impact the subject, that did not carry an interest, and that did not support Macaulay's well-considered arguments and delineations.<br />Among my favorite histories! 2,100 excellent and highly readable pages.	2001-05-03

Unlike any other book you have read: there is no jealousy in this book, no bickering, no envy, no greed, no pettiness -- there is only life and the struggle for life. That life is good. That living is good. That making it through the day, or the hour, is good.<br />The book pounds the reader through the confines of the frozen north, where two men attempt to transport a decedent in his coffin. On the way, hungry wolves pursue the trail -- we can't blame them -- &quot;their muscles are strings&quot; -- the wolves are literally starving to death. The men understand this, but also that they have a job to do.<br />Later, one of these wolves delivers a few pups, and the pups struggle to live within their den while the mother attempts to find food that is virtually nonexistent. One of these wolves is White Fang -- in his struggle for survival, he must rise above his fears and his teachings, and in so doing, discovers that living is essential, that living is good.<br />Through trials and tribulations, White Fang understands that love is the highest pinnacle of existence, and that order is the highest essential of Life.<br />Crammed with so many wonderful scenes, so many poigant and solemn images of life, the struggle for life, the very act of living -- impossible to put down, impossible to ignore.<br />If you have doubts about your world, your doubts will be shaken if you read this book.	2001-05-03

These introductions catch the reader quickly, as if he is among the passengers on the cruise. The profiles are diversified, realistic and tense.<br />From these profiles, Christie weaves a plot through various interviews between the detective, witnesses, possible suspects, and between other bystanders, etc.<br />The plot is intricate and requires careful reading, and even a guess to determine who the murderer might be.<br />Here, Christie allows the suspense to come down to the wire, and in the last few chapters, all incidents are tidied up in a realistic and satisfactory fashion.	2001-05-03

During this time, as Rome had to withdraw legions from the island, the Scots from Ireland and the Picts from Scotland pillaged and plundered the hapless inhabitants, and England appealed to Rome for protection. After two campaigns, Rome could no longer submit help, but left words on self-defense and the manufacture of arms, which the early Britons could scarcely use.<br />Nennius expands on the interaction between Vortigern and the Saxons from Denmark, who saw that they had a weak people to deal with, and pillaged and plundered in their turn. This volume also includes the marvels of King Arthur. A more expanded work generally on the characters known to us from Gildas and Bede.<br />A highly readable text from one of the earliest English historians.	2001-04-21

A few words on Rome leaving instructions to the Britons on how to manufacture arms and protect themselves, and remarks on early defense against the Scots and Picts round out parts of the text, but scriptural statements as injunctions to his people form the main core of this highly readable work.<br />A fine translation with footnotes of the earliest English historian.	2001-04-21

Like his other works, I expected this to be a knowledgeable travelogue and journal of discovery, but a discovery of what? Burton spends the first quarter of the book discussing Alexandria and Cairo before he gets underway (this last detail almost lost in the maze of other irrelevant observations). He names every sedimentary formation and every flower on his route, and then disputes or corrects every historical observation on Midian -- Biblical, Greek, Latin and Arab. When someone washes a handful of sand and exposes a tiny nugget of gold (presumably the intended core of this book), the detail itself appears as a small nugget amidst so much worthless sand.<br />From time to time, a promising anecdote or observation on a Biblical place or event raises clarity above the labyrinth, only to plunge again and at length.<br />Glutted with learning, too heavy for the non-scholarly reader, thick with observations of questionable relevance, and fraught with meaningless, private anecdotes, the book taxes the reader considerably. Use caution.	2001-03-25

Unfortunately, this frequently adds an unpalatable heaviness to his writings. At times -- and here only at times -- does his penchant for every detail add oppressive weight to his narrative.<br />In every Burton book, he describes in hideous detail all the foibles, deficiencies or vices of his traveling companions, frequently porters or guides on hire. In the Narrative, this tendency exists, but to a much lesser extent. Here, thankfully to the reader, Burton softens his powers of running down his entourage to no purpose.<br />This book is otherwise an excellent story of obtaining license to leave Cairo, to travel through Suez and Yambu, and to join the pilgrimage trail up through Medina (in this first volume). His descriptions of the Prophet's Mosque and tomb are enjoyable, and the details along the route are lively and captivating. Burton does not reach the Holy City of Mecca until the second volume.<br />Burton, as the other reviewer pointed out, is an acquired taste, or distaste, as the reader must debate for himself. If you could not stomach another Burton, you'll still probably enjoy this one. If you enjoyed this one, savor it. The second volume delights just as well.	2001-03-15

A true groan.<br />This book fairly centers on Butch Cassidy, starts and ends with him, but is grossly unappealing otherwise. Subtitled &quot;and the Wild Bunch,&quot; the subtitle overruns all credits. Each chapter features some new, unheard-of bandit, and uses such ridiculous metaphor, description and humor as to elevate the topic to a comic strip.<br />For instance, author Kelly declares a posse's hanging a criminal to their wanting him to suffer &quot;an acute case of suspended animation.&quot; And the thoughtless &quot;Tom Horn had checked off plenty of Apaches in his time.&quot; And the supposition: &quot;He was ordered held for the district court, but the records do not show that disposition was made of the case.&quot; [Conclusion suspiciously resembles guessing. . .] &quot;He probably broke jail before his trial came up.&quot; And also the colorful: &quot;Longabaugh returned his shots and no more was heard of the Great Falls officer.&quot;<br />The author's claim is countless personal interviews (40 years later) with people who were eyewitnesses to the events described. Everything then appears like the author gathered around the family table, telling old wives' tales that he originally heard from his decrepid old uncle. He speaks of the &quot;Outlaw Trail&quot; the same way the rest of us talk about &quot;high school reunion&quot; or &quot;baby's christening.&quot; Every criminal is a hero to him. Every gunfight an enjoyable exchange between showmen. Every hanging or robbery a charming vignette.<br />Kelly concludes: &quot;It was the irony of fate that this leader of the Wild Bunch, successful in a hundred forays, who had taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash during his lifetime at the point of a gun, should finally die for the theft of a mule!&quot;<br />If you see anyone reading this book, kindly take it from him. It will benefit you both.	2000-12-29

Nevertheless, the author shows his subject's faults and favors with equal ease, and his reasoning is neither absurd nor apologetic. Strong casework appears throughout the book, but sometimes peppered with too much comic relief.<br />An enjoyable and easy read about a very interesting man, a tragic figure, the victim of his own legend.	2000-12-24

Perhaps he should have left it there.<br />Perhaps this is too harsh. There were occasions leading to his visit to Harar, the forbidden city of Somali-land, where I indulged a hearty chuckle, but this only lasted long enough to bring me upright in my sleeping chair, formerly a reading chair. Not until he reached Harar did he seize my interest and full attention, yet as he was not permitted pen and paper while there, for 10 full days the description relies on his memory. In comparison to the journey there (the entire first volume, over 200 pages), he writes with exacting prose every time his wayfarers or guides resisted the mission, and every other sundry related to the journey.<br />The descriptions of Harar, its culture, its people and Burton's condition are excellent, but unfortunately are too brief, almost marginal in a work that contends mainly with desert travels. I enjoyed hearing about the lions visiting camp, the difficulties on the route, and other jokes made against his guides, yet I thought I was about to absorb a more entertaining exposition on the forbidden city, rather than an exhausting diary of a mission that perpetuates in a cloud between the send-off and the return.<br />Just to show that I paid attention, I noted with disapproval that Burton repeats twice the datum that &quot;red pepper&quot; is THE condiment of East Africa (I was satisfied on this particular the first time.) Prepare for a thick shell for a core subject Burton laid on too thinly.	2000-09-30

Before tackling Gibbon's daunting work, I had only read smaller volumes of history. Some Livy here, a Polybius there, a Dio in between, but I was unprepared for the joys I would find with Gibbon.<br />His style is typical 18th century. This may take some getting used to, but it shouldn't take much. From the opening chapter, Gibbon brings the reader through an exciting, fulfilling, and sometimes a hopelessly tragic panorama of the Roman Empire.<br />He has been criticized by modern scholarship as misleading, since he neglected issues that modern scholars find so pivotal in Roman and Byzantine history, yet the volumes are wonderful reads nevertheless. He has also been criticized for his sarcastic criticism and denunciation of weak socities, religious institutions, government, cultures, etc., but this has been set down as an 18th century fixation -- and who can argue against this?<br />Gibbon treats his subject very lucidly. He appears in his footnotes from time to time, just to visit with his readership. I thoroughly like the man!	2000-09-30

While true, that the drawings don't always fit with the  adjacent text, this will neither lessen the impact of the journal nor  irritate the enjoyment of its descriptions. Like Lewis and Clark, Powell  suffered great hardships on the way, going so far along known courses, and  then emerging into the great unknown. His account of his last ten critical  days on the Colorado River is compelling, his descriptions of the Grand  Canyon and other canyons are frequently better than the illustrious  drawings, and his geographic and geologic explanations of the basin's  creation help shape a broader view of one of America's most visited  places.<br />I highly recommend this as a reference book, a history book of  the area, an adventure story, and an art portfolio.	2000-08-12

Olsen can't take the call	In his attempt to make this book more readable, Olsen describes the  general layout, topography, flora and fauna of Glacier National Park, then  describes the diet, behavior and habitat of the grizzly bear, then briefly  discusses interaction between grizzlies and the increasing park traffic.  &quot;Something had to give way&quot; is his introductory message.<br />The  gruesome deaths of two 19-year old women are staggering, and the details  given surrounding the park service's mentality and reactions, the scenes of  the attacks, and the search and rescue operations are lucid and compelling.  Respect for those families is observed in every detail, and rather than  make this a thriller (this would have condemned the author in my eyes), he  reports as factually as possible, to let us witness the scene as a hopeful  but helpless spectator, like those present proved to be.<br />That statement  aside, I did not like how Olsen seemed on the one hand to condemn the park  service for letting bears roam rampant, and on the other condemn mankind  for bringing his crowding numbers into a small area that will inevitably  push the grizzlies into remote Canada and Alaska. These ideas seem  contradictory. People go swimming in the surf and are killed by sharks --  we neither condemn the lifeguards nor call for the extermination of the  species. Here, Olsen concludes his book by making us wonder if we should  slaughter the bears of Glacier, and then feel sorry for ourselves that we  had to do it.<br />Excellent factual reporting, confusing as a philosophical  study, schizophrenic as a treatise on environtalism.<br />Incidentally, I  wonder who can tell me this: Olsen spells the name of one victim Helgeson;  Herrero's book consistently spells her Hegelson. The poor girl became  notorious for being Glacier's first known fatality to the grizzly. Let's at  least preserve her memory by correctly spelling her name!	2000-08-04

In the first few pages, his old wife Adele dies of a heart attack in  the Inn. Since the last page clarifies this for the reader, that Jim  Petersen is actually author Cal Glover, I am reluctant to sacrifice his  book on the altar of &quot;if at first you don't succeed....&quot;<br />There  are many engaging things about this book: (1) the hikes and hiking  descriptions are excellent, except I personally was bothered that the  hiking fanatic in the book needs to get high on marijuana to fully get high  on nature; (2) the sprinkling of wildlife here, including the bears -- just  as elusive to park personnel as to the constant visitor -- are vivid,  engaging and realistic, especially the bear encounters (there are 4, the  first one doesn't come until page 49 of 224 pages, but it is a black bear  snatching up food left out at a backcountry campground; the next p 120 is a  grizzly attack that reads like any account of an actual grizzly attack);  (3)the author's total knowledge of the park and his descriptions of its  changing seasons and its full spectrum of offerings.<br />Unfortunately, what  kills the book in my opinion is the goofy banter and interaction between  the central characters, which makes the book seem only a sure hit among ex-  and present NP employees. A guy who wants to be a writer, another who wants  to run the fastest marathon, another who gets high on pot and mushrooms  before he can fully absorb the scenery, a woman who only came here to work  because her mother waitresses there 26 years before,lonely hearts and many  who seem to regret their self-made prisons. All realisticcharacters and  portrayals, but this is the central stuff of this work.<br />If you wanted  grizzlies and the titled encounter, wait until nearly the end of the book.  If you wanted to read about what it's like to hike in Yellowstone, or a  sampling of what wildlife abounds and how you might encounter it during  your stay, you'll have to hunt and peck through the table talk, pillow talk  and bar talk of our characters. Still, Cal Glover gives us something in  this book, but the title delivers only in the remotest way.	2000-08-04

This is among the most wonderful espionage  books ever written, recommended in my graduate college curriculum in a  management course.

Using Great Britain as his main example, he also details the Dutch fleets  to demonstrate their reason for becoming a European superpower in their own  right. Later he identifies the presence of the French navy, apart from any  material success in its engagements, as one of the determining reasons why  America had a chance to win its independence. Finally, as he hints of the  supreme commercial and military importance of the proposed (Panama) canal,  against the declining state of the American navy and the paltry condition  of its merchant fleet, he urges that America's prosperity if not survival  depends on the powerful revival of its sea power.<br />An excellent read, a  great general history book, and very lucid explanations, easy for the  layman.

They break camp, return up the Columbia River,  and with Sacajawea's vital help, find their way over the mountains where  the snows are so thick that trails are impossible to discover. Thankfully  the expedition resumes the Missouri, and after averaging 20 miles a day on  the ascent (using oar and sail), they frequently make 80 miles a day on the  descent.<br />After such a long and harrowing journey, full of hardships and  decorated with delights, the men are anxious to press for home, sometimes  not landing for rest or game during their earnest advance.<br />This trio of  books is among the best reads I've ever had of men journeying into the  unknown, discovering the best in themselves, and holding to the notion that  perseverance will ultimately endure.<br />I loved the book, a satisfying  completion to a wonderful tale.	2000-08-01

The team  meets its greatest hardships, not least of which is choosing the best  overland route when the Missouri is no longer navigable. The correct choice  (and the correct choice was made) is vital to preserving the goodwill of  the men and the success of the expedition. Grizzly bears continue to harass  the men (many hunters are treed), the mosquitoes become horribly  bothersome, and when game becomes scarce, they trade for horses, sometimes  killing the colts for food; elsewhere they trade to feed upon dogs, at  first a meat loathsome to the men, but after adaptation and long usage, it  becomes a favorite food, as the expedition trades for that article  particularly. Many times plant roots and dried fish served as the only food  for days on end, which made the men sick, who were so drenched with rain  (they built their winter cabins in the rain), that many were too sick to  participate in the necessary subsistence.<br />Here Sacajawea and her husband  are saved from drowning by the vigilance of Captain Clark.<br />This volume  provides many instances of bighorn and behavior, pronghorn antelope and  behavior, and of course grizzly bears. This wonderful volume of harrowing  escapes, exciting scenes of the endurance of man, and the wonderful rewards  from severe hardships ends in March 1806, just before the expedition  evacuates Fort Clatsop on the Pacific Coast.<br />A wonderful read for early  American exploration, and an excellent resource for the American wilderness  at the beginning of the 19th century.	2000-07-31

His major and minor characters in this book interact so well that you become one of the community.<br />The time frame is 1396, the scene Perth, Scotland. The main figure is Henry  (Harry) Gow, sometimes called Henry Smith, after his vocation as an arms  manufacturer, with stout smithees in his employ. Henry aspires to the hand  of Catherine Glover, daughter of a prosperous but peace-loving merchant of  Perth. The subtitle of the book, St Valentine's Day, speaks of the custom  of the time, but this one night, a ladder is criminally lifted below  Catherine's window, and a mysterious intruder seems bent on abducting  Catherine in these lawless times. In the discovery of this crime, Henry  attacks the intruders, lopping off a hand of one which carries a ring on  one finger. This outrage is so atrocious to the townsmen that they call  upon their nobleman protector, Sir Patrick Charteris, to seek for royal  justice. In the ensuing sequence, the ring on the lopped finger traces back  to a lawless knight associated with the profligate Prince of Scotland,  David.<br />Harry Gow is a warring man, frequently representing Perth in  contests for &quot;justice&quot; called &quot;combat by right of  arms.&quot; Catherine, his intended sweetheart, is morally opposed to these  contests and Harry's warlike ideas, yet a crime has been committed on her  house. Soon the parties involved in that &quot;frolic&quot; as they deem it  make an attempt on Smith's life, killing instead another townsman who  idolized Smith. This guilt, that the blow meant for him had killed an  innocent townsman, coupled with the outrage on the house of Glover, push  Smith to accept Perth's share in the upcoming trial by feat of arms, as the  Prince's complicity becomes known.<br />Intrigues at the court of Scotland,  its kind-hearted but weakened king, his scheming brother the Duke of  Rothsay, the indolence of the profligate prince, the incredible power and  machinations of the Earl of Douglas (the first subject in the kingdom)  appear in their various colors. Associations with Glover's house, where he  reared the firstborn of a Highland clan chieftain, who rises to assume the  leadership of the clan and also aspires to Catherine's hand, form another  intriguing line in the story which is closely interwoven with Harry's  plight, the path of the thoughtless Prince in the scheming hands of his  uncle, the power of the Douglas, and the weakening of the king.<br />Along  with Heart of Mid-Lothian, this is Scott's best work. Forget Ivanhoe, try  this one on for size.	2000-07-30
US	49903697	R3JZF8CCDIG244	1582012504	20540952	The Monastery, Vol. 18	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Explosive Subject Fizzles Under the Master's Hand	In the afterward, the author himself calls this book a failure. Is there more to be said?<br />The timeframe of this book is roughly 1550-1575. The place is a distant catholic monastery at the end of a haunted canyon, all  situated far south of the new and fiercely Presbyterian Scots and well  north of the English court, somewhat at the middle frontier of the rapidly  expanding spread of Protestantism from the court of Queen Elizabeth. The  central figure of the book is the fiercely Catholic Sub-Prior Eustace of  the monastery, whose old school friend, a devout Reformist minister, later  appears in the book to dispute the &quot;false&quot; Catholic faith with  the Sub-Prior. While this contention between the two faiths is the reason  for the book, it is much overspread with the military factiousness of the  times, where powerful men care little for faith but much for power and  arms.<br />In the second half of the book, armies bearing more the names of  their lords than the oaths of their religious sentiments encroach upon the  monastic demesnes to settle their rights by contests of arms(another motif  of the book being just this sort of assumption of church revenues and  properties by powerful lords).<br />An enchanted and supernatural White Lady  of Avenel continues to appear throughout the book, frequently invoked by an  incantation by a young hothead who strives to win a young lady (supposedly)  of the catholic faith, whose mother had read to her since her youth from a  copy of the Bible in common English. This was a new innovation at the time,  which the Catholic clergy violently opposed. In a duel with an English  dandy, the lad runs him through, leaving him for dead (seemingly consistent  with the White Lady's foretelling). He later appears miraculously healed  and his wound cauterized. These fantastic images are enough to make one  sick, but I believe Scott used them to express the fantastic nature of  Catholic spirits and miracles and to expose the seemingly idolatry of  worship before effigies of saints. The book exposes the Catholic idea that  priests were expected to pray for souls, to know the Divine word, not the  layman, who was to enrich the church so that the brothers could pray for  their souls (this being the Catholic idea of &quot;good works&quot;). The  book also ridicules the calling upon and worshipping before saints and  using signs rather than the inward prayer directly to one's Savior as the  only appropriate manner of practicing religion.<br />In the end, neither the  dispute between the opposing faiths, the arguments between the old school  fellows, the warring nature of the barons, nor the inflexible mind of the  Sub-Prior maintain a consistent cohesion in the book, which ends in a loose  coalescence, whereby Scott might have plenty of room to redeem himself in  the book's sequel, The Abbot.<br />The characters are poor and unexciting, the  theme seems too obvious and one can guess every argument, and the inclusion  of so many enchanted visions and superfluous motifs to ridicule of the  times and the &quot;other&quot; faith are as empty of merit as the book is  in general.	2000-07-30
US	49903697	R25Q5NE5ZIV7NU	0375751521	601750908	Hunting Trips of a Ranchman & The Wilderness Hunter	Books	4	28	30	N	N	Essays on animals and hunting trips by the future President	Roosevelt purchased two cattle ranches in present-day western North Dakota, and many times went out to hunt for sport or for &quot;meat for the pot.&quot;<br />Hunting Trips of a Ranchman in effect provides essays on the  description, behavior, habitat, and survival of several species known to  the prairies and the distant forests and mountain ranges. He talks of  wildfowl (grouse, etc), elk, buffalo, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep,  white-tailed deer, black-tailed or mule deer, and finishes with Old  Ephraim, the grizzly bear. All of these books are good for armchair readers  who have never been to the western wildernesses or prairies, where these  animals can be viewed with perseverance and patience.<br />Roosevelt speaks of  elk as the most noble of the deer family and perhaps the most majestic of  all animals (which I tend to agree). He speaks of the incredible speed but  also remarkable (and sometimes fatal) curiosity of the pronghorn, who are  able to outrun any foes and keep in the open to see them at long distance  with their excellent vision. However, they run in a straight line to  provide a fairly consistent target for a good marksmen. He speaks of the  enjoyable hunting of both kinds of deer, the difficulty of approaching the  haunts of the bighorn, and his big finale, one of the best accounts of  hunting grizzlies that I have ever read. Roosevelt's respect for the bear's  ferocity is manifest, almost amounting to an admitted dread, which shows  his good sense.<br />If you are interested in the American wild, are curious  about the habits and habitats of these large species, and are drawn to the  hunting and outdoor mentality of the President who helped strengthen the  national park system, this will be an entertaining read for you.	2000-07-30
US	49903697	R1BLFAFQD4W0FR	0486257630	723308101	Lhasa and Its Mysteries	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Enthusiastically written, but dry to read	In the main, Waddell's account follows a military brigade into the sacred and forbidden precincts of Lhasa, capital of Tibet. He enthusiastically remarks, with much of the pompous pedagogy of a Brit, about details of  daily life for commoners and high priests alike, with comparisons between  the mannerisms and culture of the Tibetans, Chinese and Nepalese.<br />He  reveals, among many other and various tidbits, the history of Mt Everest,  the indispensable qualities of yak dung (for fuel), the ignorance and  widespread illiteracy of the supposedly learned monks, and the military  difficulties of the expedition.<br />Only 1/4 of the book involves Lhasa. Of  448 pages of text, the expedition does not reach the capital city until  page 326, where Waddell's observations continue on the &quot;boasted  divinity&quot; of the Dalai Lama, whose face shows ravages of smallpox. The  expedition had also been warned previously against visiting Lhasa, as the  &quot;Grand Lama might die from the shock to his religious feelings.&quot;  Waddell also details the ways of life for Tibetans in the capital, who,  like most Orientals of the period, &quot;appreciate kindness, but worship  strength.&quot;<br />Waddell appears too much in his writing. His focus is on  the grand adventure, as felt by himself, rather than on the images he hopes  to convey to his reader. His book is full of wonderful and interesting  details, but these are sprinkled like pepper on a military and political  expedition, and though intriguing from time to time, the book overall,  without being tedious, is as dry a read as they come.	2000-04-02
US	49903697	R2XOOY5P01RF68	086597022X	970488504	001: History of England (Volume I)	Books	5	24	26	N	N	Lucid but concise -- covers 1,200 years	Hume's philosophy works, I admit, have choked my senses and discouraged my interest in ever handling another of his volumes, yet this historical work, comprehensive over twelve centuries, from the Roman province through the  reign of King John and the Magna Charta, is, for history buffs, quite  difficult to put down. Hume covers only that history which pertains to  English history, and with his reference materials so scarce, we reach the  8th century by page 40. Hume covers the passing of the Romans, the  licentiousness of the Saxons after they were invited to protect the native  Britons, the irresistible conquests of the Danes, the consolidations of the  minor kingdoms, the ways of life of these various peoples, the Norman  invasion, the politics at court, and the personalities of the various  princes, with startling particulars, both in speech, action and the  incipience of national government, from the lives of its central  characters.<br />Hume speaks lucidly of the manners, customs, and religious  beliefs of the periods he covers, as well as their evolution through  time.<br />A fascinating read for anyone interested in early English history!	2000-03-12
US	49903697	RAUEMH7F9IOU	0865970270	954627655	002: History of England (Vol. II)	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Entertaining &amp; Learned -- quite difficult to put down	Volume II covers the period 1216-1485.<br />With a careful and seemingly fair hand, Hume describes the clashes between the barons and King John, as evolved into the Magna Charta; the first appearance of the house of  Commons; the subjection of Wales, the attempts to subdue Scotland, with  portraits of Robert Bruce &amp; Braveheart William Wallace; the expulsion  of the Jews; the charter to dig coal in Newcastle; the Hundred Years' War,  with smart sketches of its major conflicts; the first appearance of the  title of &quot;duke&quot;; the conflict between the Yorks and Lancasters,  in the War of the Roses; the myth of Joan of Arc is described, &amp;  Richard, earl of Warwick, the Kingmaker, the last baron to overawe the  crown, is portrayed; and, among the last episodes of the volume, the  usurpation of the crown by the earl of Glocester, later Richard III, uncle  to the heirs of the throne, who has the little princes committed to the  Tower, and then strangled. Richard meets his just rewards at the battle of  Bosworth, where he is slain.<br />A wonderful read, covering a period between  the first appearances of national government and the age when it begins to  solidify, in forms that we might recognize today. The turbulence of the  Dark and Middle Ages becomes enlightened as we approach the Renaissance.	2000-03-12
US	49903697	ROITDSSITKNDN	0865970297	245426279	003: The History of England Volume III (History of England, The)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Covers the period 1485 - 1558 AD	Hume describes, as usual, in pithy and concise English, the events from Bosworth Field, in 1485, which led directly to the coronation of Henry VII, to the coronation of Henry VIII, who is the central figure in this volume,  which might arguably serve as Henry's biography.<br />In this period, we learn  how Henry VII formed close alliances with Ferdinand of Aragon, the wealthy  prince of Spain, whose daughter, the Infanta Catherine, at 18 years of age,  was first betrothed to the future king's elder brother Arthur (16 years  old); but when Arthur dies, Henry, not wishing to return the dowry of  200,000 ducats, dumps Catherine onto his younger son, the future Henry VIII  (who is 12 at this time). This fact alone might have caused much of the  resentment toward the queen, whom Henry later divorced.<br />These incidents,  the &quot;divorce&quot; of the monarch, the break with Rome, the tightrope  walked by Henry between catholicism and the Lutheran principles, the  growing power and wealth of Spain, the rivalries and jealousies between  that nation and England and France; the growth and spread of protestant  reform; Henry's absolute control over the government, his arbitrary and  ruthless rule over the people, who esteemed him highly; his death, and the  accession of Edward VI, and later, Mary, who reversed the policies of her  father, and married Philip II of Spain, a catholic monarch; and Mary's  death, and the succession of Elizabeth, close the volume.<br />As this volume  becomes more particular than its predecessors, and covers a period of  little more than 70 years, its detail somewhat hampers the flow of events,  whereas the first two volumes were more general.<br />Still, an excellent work  of history, and a very good read.	2000-03-12
