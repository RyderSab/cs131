I became a christian because I believe the truth to be that there is a God and that the Bible is his word. The bible tells us to prove all things and hold fast to that which is the truth.  This book fails this test completely.  There are contradictions in her book.  The author claims to have been taken by Jesus to the regions of hell and she describes these horrific sufferings in her book.  At one point a soul is screaming for Jesus to help him, but Christ passes him by.  The entire book is one litany of horror of souls being tortured and false theology.  The book is completely anti biblical!  The problems and contradictions are the following.  First of all, if God is all merciful, how can he not help those who are screaming for pity in hell?  This would make him not God, but a monster.  Second problem; In Romans 10:13, it states &quot;Whoever calls on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.&quot; This means that the damned do not pray, do not ask God for mercy and in fact want nothing to do with God. They can easily be saved, but they dont want salvation.  The word &quot;Whoever&quot; includes the damned.  This one biblical verse refutes A divine revelation of hell.  There is nothing divine in this book.  Rather the book came from the authors imagination or is diabolical.  God is not the author of confusion.  This book is full of confusion.  Stick to the truth people, that alone will save you.  The bible offers sage advice;&quot;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&quot;	2001-08-01

Not only does Josh give us the way chess is really played, but the book is full of instructions and tactical methods, including ways of opening lines for effective attack.  I am a bit amazed that this book was given average reviews by a few people.  They claim this book is only for beginners to intermediate.  However, the author clearly states at the beginning of the book that the combination of methods he presents make for the highest forms of chess.  No doubt.  It is true that he starts with basic tactics but he works up very quickly to advanced concepts.  I do not give high praise easily to books, but this one certainly deserves it.  Mastery of the information Josh presents can put one very quickly on the road to chess mastery.  He gives basic tactics, then works to sacrifices, opening lines and a ton of excellent information on breaking through the oppositions defense.  This book is one of the few classics in chess.  A truly great book.	2001-01-10

The book contains basic tactical themes such as pin, removing the guard, discovery and so on.  There are eleven such themes plus mating attacks.  The solutions to the problems are given in back.  What makes this book unique is the authors excellent teaching style.  He gives advice on mastering these tactics by telling the reader to try to solve them a little quicker each time he does them.  This trains your &quot;chess vision&quot; to a high level.  At the end of the book he gives some tips on how to improve your tactics, which is some of the best advice I have ever read about chess.  The value in this book is its simplicity.  The illustrations show no more than ten pieces on the board, making it easier to understand the tactical themes being demonstrated.  Although the book is written for beginners,it can be used by all skill levels.  The author writes in this book that the great grandmaster Mikhail Tal used to look through beginners books looking for ideas.  He did this probably because beginner books boil down chess to basic ideas that show up even in the most advanced chess.  Also even the knowledge in beginners books can constantly be perfected, which can make for a very powerful player.  This is a tactics book that should be turned to again and again.	2000-12-13

This is a good book on the internal arts as explained in the taoist tradition.  The author claims to have witnessed the incredible feats of a master of these internal arts.  He writes of levitation, telepathy, etc. in a fascinating and engaging way.  However, there are some problems with the book.  The master this author writes about claims that there are 72 levels of power.  He claims that Bodhidharma, the great buddhist master, reached the seventy second level and died.  This doesnt make sense.  Someone who has attained nirvana, as Bodhidharma did, is incapable of suffering.  Thus such a saint could not die or suffer in any way.  The truth is we dont know what happened to Bodhidharma.  Secondly, according to Buddha, Nirvana is unconditioned ie., it is infinite.  This being so, how could there be seventy two levels of power?  As soon as one says the infinite is this or that, one is automatically limiting it, and thus it can no longer be the infinite.  Perhaps the author meant that there are seventy two levels of power on earth, but perhaps more in higher realms of reality.  Taoism is a great religion, but its founder Lao Tzu did not have the full truth as Buddha himself did.  Lao Tzu did not claim to be all knowing, but Buddha did.  Although this book is well written and does show the awesome powers inherit in man, the buddhist teaching goes much further in explaining it then does taoism.  Some excellent books on buddhism are: What the buddha taught by walpola rahula, Buddhism by Christmas Humpreys, and the Secrets of Chinese meditation by Charles Luk.  This last book,near the end of the book, explains why the buddhist teaching is superior to the taoist.	2000-11-20

There are excellent diagrams on strategy, defense, checkmate and back rank mates.  I have read some of the negative reviews for this book, but I dont agree with them.  Becoming a master at anything means mastering basic concepts at very high levels. The saying that Practice makes Perfect is forever true.  This certainly applies to this book.  I have never met anyone who is perfect in applying the principles in this book.  It does not lose its value with use, but increases it.  Students should turn to this book again and again and keep working at it.  It will pay off in great chess skill.	2000-10-11

Bristol talks about suggestion, visualization, the mirror technique and telepathy.  All success books use this in one form or another.  The instructions are practical and they do work.  You must be persistant at these techniques, perhaps for years, but they do work and bring astounding results.  Bristol gives case histories of the use of these techniques that are very enlightening.  I have read of other uses of it.  Hunter Davies wrote a book about the Beatles and he quoted Paul McCartney as saying that anyone can be a success if he tells himself this often enough.  Hard work is essential of course, but suggestion is certainly a most powerful assistant.	2000-10-09

Smiths book has been called one of the best books for the atheist position.  I fail to see why.  Aside from the angry tone of the book all of his arguments can be refuted.  To take a few examples.  Lets start with his argument for existance.  Smith argues that postulating Gods existance is unnecessary.  Smith believes that God is a contingent being.  That is, God may or may not exist.  Lets assume for the moment that Smith is right.  God does not exist.  What then is there? Well we have simply existance.  Now it is axiomatic that something cannot come from nothing.  Existance therefore must be eternal.  If its eternal, then it must have no beginning or end.  It must be infinite.  What is infinite must have all positive things in it.  There is no such thing as a negative truth, thus there can be no evil in this existance.  What is this awesome existance?  God.  Smith proves Gods existance in spite of himself.  What atheists try to do is to say there is no God, there is only the universe.  If they are pressed to explain existance, they give to the universe the attributes of God ie; eternity, infinity, etc.  What then is the diffrence?  Is the universe God? No, because it is not perfect. It is not eternal nor is it infinite.  How then do atheists explain the existance?  They can't.  Either they admit God is, or their explanations are unintelligble.  Atheism is unintelligble.  That disqualifies it from even philosophical inquiry.  Smith claims that theistic claims are unintelligible, but its the atheists that have no meaning to their claims.  Smith then argues against Gods existance, by claiming that God cannot be all good and yet evil exists.  It is true that God is all good, but this also means that God is all just.  If God did not punish evil resulting from man's wrong use of free will, then it could be claimed that God doesnt exist.  Smiths book is good in that it gives the contrary viewpoint, but it does not present a convincing case against God.	2000-10-08

He gets down to the elements of how we can know truth.  This is in sharp contrast to the majority of philosophy books that give another mans opinion, but not on how we know truth.  Descartes begins his book by saying that there are contrary opinions among philosophers, other people and just in general.  For every opinion given there is a contrary opinion, so how do we know truth, if knowing truth is even possible?  He writes in his book, that what we know as the world ,could be the creation of a demon who fools us into thinking that what we know is real.  So he writes that one should doubt everything.  Then he says that someone is doubting, so there must be something real that is doubting.  Hence he arrives at his famous self evident principle &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;  He then states that we begin our search for truth on self evident principles such as &quot;Truth exists&quot; and his principle stated above among others.   We divide our problem and solve it starting from the easiest to the most difficult.  As a final step we take in all the evidence into review.  This is an excellent method in which to find truth.  His first step though is the most important one, that is, establishing doubt.  We can't really know what a thing is and hence we should be doubtful.  This is a far better method than the scientific method and far easier to implement.  Science does not and cannot arrive at truth, because truth is eternal and has no limit.  The most science can do is to have a utility value.  That is it can make life easier for us by mastering nature.  To find truth we leave that to the religions such as Christianity and Buddhism and also to the philosophers like Descartes.	2000-09-28

The book is about a scientist who tries to make animals into human beings and the vengence these animals take on the mad doctor.  The plot,characterization, theme, descriptions and everything in the book is first rate.  Wells is without question in the top ten list of the best writers of all time.  Only Shakespeare and Poe are better.  I have read a lot of fictional books and some of them are totally boring, but Wells has the ability to hook you into his stories.

The book is full of diagrams on one,  two and three move mates.  It also gives miniature games which show how to  play the openings and the middle game, especially on how to attack the  king.  There is an excellent section on engame technique as well.  Also  included are some games of the polgars illustrating various principles of  chess.  The beauty of the book lies in two aspects.  First of all, by  constant repitition in solving the diagrams one is on his way to pattern  recognition, which is essential to chess mastery.  This means that one can  see mating positions and various weaknesses in a position far ahead in the  game.  Secondly, the diagrams if closely studied show chess strategies and  tactics that can be applied to other positions as well.  For instance, in  one diagram some moves were made, forcing the opposition to block his own  pieces.  This can also be used in the openings and other positions that may  arise.  Probably the lack of text in the book, makes the student WORK  harder to find similar tactics in other positions.  The book is somewhat  expensive, but worth it.	2000-08-12

One chapter claims that much of Christianity came from pagan myth.  The author shows that the ancients had  their cucified saviours, teachings of the trinity and so forth, then jumps  to the unjustified conclusion that christianity took all of these myths and  wove them into creating the christian churches.  There are similarities  between pagan religious teachings and christianity, but this does not  justify the faulty conclusion that christianity borrowed from the pagans.   To believe this conclusion we would have to believe that the pagans  &quot;invented&quot; the trinity, the crucifixion, eucharistic teachings,  saviours,confession,rosaries, and other similiarities from the earliest  times and then transfered this knowledge to other cultures.  What could be  the reasoning behind all this make believe? In addition, we would have to  believe that the bible is a fable.  That the writers of the books of the  bible knew it was a fable, that they lied about the crucifixion, that  martyrs gave their lives to a myth, that the apostles were liars when they  claimed to be eye witnesses to the crucifixion of christ and so forth.   What the author doesnt tell you is what the truth actually is.  The bible  says specifically that God created Adam and Eve full of Wisdom.  When they  disobeyed God, they lost much of the original justice they had.  However  they did have knowledge of a redeemer as God told them after the fall.   Since they were created full of wisdom, they must have had great knowledge  of many things that was passed to their children.  Over time these  teachings became corrupted and this is how the numerous crucified saviours,  trinities and all the rest appeared in pagan teachings.  If this is not the  case one would be hard pressed to explain why the pagans would develop  these myths and why they have survived for thousands of years and also why  foreign cultures would accept these myths for no good reason.  The rest of  the book has chapters condemning the catholic priesthood for being  pedophiles.  While some priests are pedophiles this does not invalidate the  priesthood itself.  The author comes to the unwarranted conclusion, that  since the church is based on pagan myths this gives rise to a unhealthy  celibacy.  This supposedly causes pedophilia and other unnatural acts. How  does the author explain those priests who do no such thing ever?  Then  their is the claim that someone interpolated the name of jesus christ in  the works of the jewish historian Josephus.  Apparently the entire works of  Josephus are now suspect to these &quot;skeptics.&quot;  It has never been  proven that the name of jesus is an interpolation, simply because it is  not.  The whole book is one biased claim, that because of its bias can be  rejected as having claims to truth.  I gave the book two stars only because  it presents a case against christianity, although a very weak one, and  because it advises one to be skeptical.  For that reason it should be read  to give an idea of the other side of the story.	2000-07-31

Empiricus does an outstanding and brilliant job on describing skepticism.  He shows that a true skeptic doubts  everything, and not just the paranormal and &quot;fringe beliefs&quot;. The  book is a how to manual for being a skeptic.  The author shows why doubt is  necessary to establish truth.  He shows why we can never know something for  certain,and that all beliefs are only probabilities.  After reading this  book, one will get a better understanding of unorthodox beliefs.  One will  see that people who believe in unusual things may not be irrational at all  but hardened skeptics who may in fact be wise.  This book should be  required reading at all schools including doctoral levels of learning.  If  people were more skeptical of everything including the orthodox teachings  of science and established &quot;knowledge&quot;, we may come closer to  truth and wisdom instead of believing things that are not true.	2000-07-28

His entire book is one long tirade on what he calls pseudo science. As one finishes the book, I got the impression that anything that doesnt fit the  &quot;scientific&quot; paradigm, is not worth considering.  This is a  dangerous view to say the least.  We know there is truth and that one must  look at all the evidence to find it.  True scientific method follows this  principle. This book is one mans opinion on what reality is. But to claim  it as scientific doesnt make sense.  Who said the scientific view of  reality is the only correct one?  Buddhists believe that reality can be  gained by direct insight. All science can be reduced to skepticism.  I  agree with skepticism, since there are two sides to anything.  Yet Sagan  denies the evidence for the subjects he critiques, or dismisses it as  irrational or impossible.  Thus he portrays science as a candle in a dark  irrational world, enlightning us toward the truth.  In fact, all it does is  enlighten us to what others consider to be true, but may not be true at  all.  The danger in Sagans book is the same danger there is in any book  that presents only one side of the evidence, people believe it without  questioning it.  Science is not immune to skepticism.  Yet the information  presented in Sagans book critiques the paranormal while extolling science  as our saviour.  A true skeptic would question science itself and its  methods, which many scientists do not do.  Science as portrayed in this  book is not science at all, but religion.  It is religion because sagan and  others believe it without hardly a question.  A true scientist is a great  skeptic, questioning and doubting everything and examining everything.  I  doubt there are many scientists like that today.  Sagans book surely does  not qualify as such.  But he gives us an insight into his thinking and the  &quot;science&quot; haunted world.	2000-07-24

The author presents an enormous amount of evidence claiming that Christ is not a historical figure, but a rehash of  earlier myths.  She claims that Christ along with Buddha, Osiris, Hercules  and all the other gods and saviours were inventions of the ancient mystery  schools.  She lays stress on Egypt as being the foundation of all of these  myths.  There are numerous problems with her thesis that either she does  not know or does not adress in the book.  She correctly notes that  religions appear to be teaching pretty much the same thing.  That is, there  are crucified saviours, eucharistic teachings and the rest that predate  christianity.  Also there are numerous accounts of a flood, the creation of  the first man in other religions and creation stories that are very similar  to the bible.  The author then claims that the bible itself was written  from pagan sources.  Actually the exact OPPOSITE is the truth.  It is the  pagans who borrowed from the hebrews and their teachings, whether oral or  written.  This explains the similarities between the religions.  Hislop in  his book the Two Babylons does an excellent job in stating that other  religions are a corruption of a true religion.  Intrestingly, the author  cites this book in her sources.  The corruption of a true religion would  make sense out of other religions and their similar accounts of biblical  events. As to the claim in her book that india is one of the oldest  religions in the world, how does she explain that some gurus in india,  trace their lineage to the biblical Abraham?  If the mystery schools are  the source of all these myths, where did they get their knowledge?  Where  did the mystery schools get their knowledge of Nirvana, Karma and the  endless powers of the mind?  Would Christians give their lives in death to  a myth?  There is nothing stopping God from appearing as Buddha, Christ oranyone else.  Nor do these teachings contradict one another.  The Bible  itself says that God speaks to man in many ways and that as a man thinks in  his heart so is he.   The author also does not present the arguments  against her thesis, which is the fundamental principle of all scholarship  and scientific thinking.  If she had presented the arguments against her  case and tried to refute them, this book would be taken more seriously.   But as it stands, it in no way, can lay claim to scholarship.	2000-05-11

All of Murphys books are excellent, but  this one in particular is simply wonderful.  The author has a knack for  clear and simple writing that is easily understood and logical.	2000-02-10

Every game illustrates a strategic principle of chess, such as defense, attack, rook  mobility etc.  All of these principles are illustrated by master play.   This is a very instructional book.  The notes to the moves show the reader  why the master chose this move and not another.  There are also many  variations to the move made.  This is a great book to play through using a  chess board.  The masters playing these games really make the strategic  principles illustrated come alive.  A must buy book for content and price.	2000-02-01

All other bibles are to be compared to this one.  St. Jerome who translated this bible was very careful in using the most accurate texts.  The Ignatius  bible which comes in a close second cannot be claimed to be more accurate  than this one.  The douay rheims  has been compared with the greek text in  which the Ignatius bible is based and has been found lacking.  For instance  in the douay rheims it states in the book of ecclesistaces that the number  of fools is infinite.  Yet this quote is nowhere to be found in the  Ignatius bible.  This is not to say the Ignatius bible is bad but it is not  as good as the douay rheims.  This bible is majestic and simply breathes  authenticity and beauty of expression.  This is indeed the word of God.   One has to read this bible to see what I mean.  An outstanding translation  that will probably never be surpassed.	2000-01-28

The meditation techniques are valid and they do work.  He gives good advice on using meditation as a  method of self discovery.  However, the author is a psychologist and know  very little about mysticism. What suprised me is his flippant attitude  toward mysticism.  He writes that he does not understand why the mystics  talked about the ways meditation must be performed.  The author attempts to  divorce meditation from its mystical aspects and this is very unwise.   Meditation is steeped in the tradition of yoga and eastren religions.  The  purpose of meditation is to attain nirvana or union with God, which is very  lofty indeed.  Meditation invokes a cosmic energy called prana.  When  enough is accumalated it clears the mind and body of obstructions. This can  lead to symptoms of dizziness, difficulty breathing for a short while,  symptoms of what appear to be heart attacks, rapid heartbeat, headaches and  so forth.  These are nothing to be alarmed about.  However, Leshan does a  disservice to his readers by treating the mystics and their teachings in  such a off hand manner. Meditation is serious buisness and it cannot be  divorced from its religious aspect, no matter what Leshan says. The mystics  studied meditation and its effects for thousands of years, they know what  they are talking about.  Leshans book is good as an introduction to  meditation.  But the serious seeker should look to other sources.  A good  place to start is to get a book called Energies of Transformation by Bonnie  Greenwell. She is a Psychologist who does not disparage the mystics, but  provides a book, which shows the effects of meditation in a non biased  view.	2000-01-16

Some religions such as Hinduism claim to be the oldest, but as Hislop shows this cannot be true.  Hislop shows that religions have a common origin.   This origin is in Babylon.  A careful reading of his book shows that these  religions are corruptions of a true religion.  On this I agree. Many  religions have a teaching on the trinity and similar teachings that point  to a common origin.  But a corruption does not mean a religion is  completely false, but that it does not teach the full truth.  This full  truth is in the Bible.  For instance, the Bible teaches that as a man  thinks in his heart, so is he.  This is a teaching on the powers of the  mind. Thus, religions such as christian science, buddhism and mind science  are religions based on this quote from the Bible.  But they are not  religions that teach the full truth in the Bible and therefore can be  called corruptions. Other corruptions are the claims of those who say that  Hercules carried a cross, that Krishna was crucified, that there were  sixteen crucified saviors long before Jesus, that Buddha miraculousy fed a  multitude and so forth.  All of these are corruptions that have a common  origin, and this origin is Babylon.  Hislop shows how religions started and  then spread to egypt, india and so on.  Although he indicts the Catholic  Church on being pagan, I am not in complete agreement with this.  However,  his arguments on the origin and spread of religion are brilliant and are  alone worth the price of the book.	2000-01-03

I received many negative votes to those who did not find my review helpful.  My understanding of witchcraft is dealing with the devil.  However it has  come to my attention that witches do not even believe in a devil. The term  &quot;witchcraft&quot; then must mean something else than the term used in  the bible.  This being so then my previous review was in error.  I  sincerely apologize to any pagans or anyone else who was offended by the  review.	1999-12-13
