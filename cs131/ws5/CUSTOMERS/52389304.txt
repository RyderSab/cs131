Convention of 1940 and How It Freed FDR to Save the Western World	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A Pivotal Moment of History Explained	Charles Peters's \\"Five Days in Philadelphia\\" is an incisive work that combines the best of narrative history alongside a defining moment explaining America at a critical crossroad.  This defining moment occurred in Philadelphia at the 1940 Republican National Convention.  Its repercussions reverberated throughout Europe as well as the rest of the world.    <br /> <br />Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had anticipated continuing the American tradition of presidents not seeking third terms, decided to shatter that precedent and, in effect, unwritten law by running in 1940.  The reason was increasingly darkening European clouds as the forces of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich focused on completing domination that Roosevelt and his advisers were concerned would soon threaten America as well.  As Hitler talked about a Third Reich that would endure for one thousand years Roosevelt planned a reelection campaign buttressed around America allying itself with Winston Churchill and a besieged England along with further perpetuating the New Deal. <br /> <br />Two prominent Republican Senators, Robert Taft of Ohio and Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, along with youthful district attorney Thomas E. Dewey from New York, vied for their party's nomination at the Philadelphia convention.  They adhered to traditional Republican isolationist views that alarmed Roosevelt and his brain trust. <br /> <br />Into the mix, in a manner reminiscent of a Frank Capra movie, came the man they then called the \\"barefoot lawyer\\" from Indiana, Wendell Willkie, who became the wild card of the proceedings.  Willkie was a prominent corporate attorney then living in Ohio who had been an early New Deal supporter of Roosevelt's before breaking with him on anti-trust policies.  Delegates looking for a fresh face and a contrast from the presented archetypal image of a Republican old guard bent on opposition and mired deeply in the past liked what they saw in the folksy Indianan with Horatio Alger roots. <br /> <br />In the classic historical American example of a genuine draft, the outsider and, until recently, Roosevelt Democrat took the convention by storm as delegates and gallery onlookers sustained a steady chant of \\"We want Willkie!\\"  When the political novice won the nomination the question emerged as to where Willkie stood on foreign affairs.  To the relief of Roosevelt and the Democratic Party Willkie embraced an active policy of assisting England and the European allies, rejecting an isolationist contrasting approach. <br /> <br />With the campaign assuming a bipartisanship in the field of foreign policy the conflict was focused on economic policy as both nominees assumed a staunch anti-Hitler stance.  The repercussions of Willkie's strong pro-Europe stance affected the conflict abroad.  America became more unified than ever concerning the European theater of war.  The stiffened resistance and effective unity enabled America to move forward in resisting Hitler without the numerous difficulties that would have otherwise abounded in a nation wherein the isolationist presence of the charismatic aviation hero Charles A. Lindbergh had held such strong sway.   <br /> <br />This book pinpoints the key events leading up to and following the historic 1940 Philadelphia Republican conclave, then effectively broadens the text to explain how America was then able to play an active role in the European conflict by vigilantly opposing Hitler's onslaught.   <br /> <br />This is an excellent cause and effect historical work that explains how a pivotal event reverberated around the world and enabled America to react to an emergency in a more unified manner.  The author's approach was both highly readable and thoroughly professional.	2005-09-06

Reader: The Hideous Truth About America's Ugliest Conservatives ("I Hate" Series, The)	Books	5	42	97	N	N	Exposing Right Wing Madness and Hypocrisy	\\"The I Hate Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Sean Hannity Reader\\" has a title that bears on the hatred spewed by the radical right wing spokespersons evaluated.  Those who object to the title should reflect on the words of those individuals analyzed.  Their own words defy any claim to reason and decency as those who disagree with their viewpoints are savagely excoriated in the midst of diatribes bereft of reason. <br /> <br />A hilarious beginning point is Ann Coulter.  With seething ferocity Coulter attacked Bill Clinton's morality and still vehemently believes that he should have been removed from office for his sexual indiscretions.  When Coulter was cornered on the Geraldo Rivera Show for her lifestyle while living in Manhattan and dating successful pornographer Robert Guccione Jr. she replied, \\"I'm not married and I can sleep with as many people as I want!\\" <br /> <br />When Coulter was later cornered on the duplicity of calling for morality as someone purporting to an ideological kinship with Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed, she responded, \\"Well, if someone behaves like that they should at least feel guilty about it.\\"  So there we have it from philosopher Coulter.  You can wear two hats by being a libertine and devout supporter of the religious right as long as you feel at least a trace of guilt for your sexual conduct.   <br /> <br />Bill O'Reilly felt a towering moral outrage so great that he launched an on the air vendetta to pressure Pepsi Cola from hiring rapper Ludacris after he recorded an album entitled \\"Word of Mouf\\" that tremendously offended the talk show host.  While self-styled moralist O'Reilly fervently attacked he ardently promoted a novel he wrote entitled \\"Those Who Trespass\\" and comparisons of the two works for offensive subject matter revealed interesting results.   <br /> <br />O'Reilly surpassed Ludacris and his objectionable album in murders by a 6 to 4 count.  Ludacris outpointed O'Reilly in the total sex scene category 68 to 39, but the Fox commentator had the edge 1 to 0 in his presentation of a \\"teen crack oral slut scene\\" since Ludacris did not present any.   <br /> <br />Perhaps O'Reilly should be asked if he sent any autographed copies of \\"Those Who Trespass\\" to Falwell, Robertson or Reed.  Would the religious right consider holding a prayer vigil to bring O'Reilly back to rectitude following his novel and that sexual harassment suit he insisted he would fight, and was a lie, only to pay a settlement fee that the Washington Post estimated was \\"in the millions\\"? <br /> <br />As for Rush Limbaugh, not only was he a vigilant believer that global warning was a myth and a fraud, stacking his expertise as a loquacious talk show host and former male nurse as a Sacramento hospital alongside some 53 Nobel Prize scientists, he also led the  fight against anyone who took drugs.   <br /> <br />Limbaugh was a hard-liner with a take no prisoners attitude, no matter how small the quantity or circumstances of the individual.  At one point he fulminated about shipping all drug users out of the country and at another believed that the solution to the problem was sending them to prison and throwing away the key.  \\"Show no mercy\\" was the Limbaugh mantra. <br /> <br />The \\"show no mercy\\" rule was appropriately amended to include rich right wing talk show hosts who hungrily popped pills.  While Sean Hannity called for \\"compassion\\" others focused on how much empathy was displayed by Limbaugh, not to mention the sheer hypocrisy of denouncing users when he was perhaps high at the time himself, or salivating for his next pill-popping opportunity.   <br /> <br />While calling for compassion from others Limbaugh has been looking out for himself.  While drug addicts are generally known to be penniless the affluent Limbaugh has hired expensive Miami criminal lawyer Roy Black to prevent federal authorities from prying into his medical records.  But Rush, these are government authorities and, well, don't you support the Patriot Act? <br /> <br />These are only a few of the points covered in an entertaining volume.  The interesting element is how little the critics have to say when they can quote the radical right as their leading spokespersons indict themselves.	2005-09-05

Spoto also gives us a look into the technical side of the master film craftsman, letting us know how he kept audiences mesmerized with compelling scenes such as the killing of Janet Leigh in \\"Psycho\\" and those incredible special effects in \\"The Birds\\" in which it appeared that the winged creatures were about to lay total siege to the previously serene Northern California town of Bodega Bay. <br /> <br />In addition to what he actually did, Donald Spoto is also to be commended for something he did not do.  In so many retrospectives of film greats, be they directors or performers, authors believe in devoting an equal or relatively equal amount of space to every movie with which they were involved.  Thankfully Spoto did not do this, devoting greater attention to the classic Hitchcock movies that generated the most discussion among filmgoers and cinema historians.  Not surprisingly for those who have studied Hitchcock's films, Spoto regards \\"Vertigo\\" starring James Stewart and Kim Novak as Hitchcock's most complete and artistic work and explains why, providing excellent insight into the film in the process.   <br /> <br />Another film that continues generating widespread praise in the Hitchcock oeuvre for its technical genius and inventive plot and characterization is \\"Notorious\\" starring the dynamite team of Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman.  Spoto covers this screen classic with comprehensive scrutiny.     <br /> <br />Spoto covers the wide sweep of Hitchcock's career.  We move from his beginnings in London in silent films and are finally transported to Hollywood and Hitchcock's impressive debut for producer David O. Selznick with \\"Rebecca\\".	2005-07-06

He specializes in foreign affairs with a particular focus on issues relating to war and peace.  His insightful volume \\"Crusade:  Chronicles of an Unjust War\\" takes the reader from the tragedy of 9/11 to the launching of the Iraq War as well as shrewdly monitoring its continuing impact. <br /> <br />Carroll realizes immediately that a calamitous result will occur from shifting the focus away from al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden following 9/11 to Iraq and the objective of toppling Saddam Hussein.  He sees problems occurring from a reaction totally out of concert with international law as well as reason.  Carroll, who has studied international religions closely, cites a major error on the part of the Bush Administration as occurring from his statement that its anti-terrorist initiative was part of a great crusade.  Carroll notes that the word crusade sends a chill throughout the Muslim world.  It stems from the bloody crusades in which so many Muslims were killed by Christians, culminating in slaughter of all of Arab occupants of Jerusalem. <br /> <br />At a time when a major international problem exists in Israel pitting Israelis and Palestinians that is marked by conflicts over settlement construction and occupation as well as suicide bombers, Carroll observes that the emphasis has been shifted away from this trouble spot, along with others such as North Korea and Iran, as American forces occupy Iraq.  He notes that this precipitous move plays into the hands of international terrorists by giving Osama bin Laden and others like him a rallying cry.  Muslims are warned that by occupying Iraq the Bush Administration is establishing designs on the entire Arab world. <br /> <br />Carroll recognizes that there is a fundamental problem with George W. Bush.  \\"When the president speaks, unscripted, from his own moral center,\\" Carroll writes, \\"what shows itself is a bottomless void.  To address concerns about the savageviolence engulfing `postwar' Iraq with a cocksure `Bring `em on!' (as he did last week) is to display an absence of imagination shocking in a man of such authority.  It showed a lack of capacity to identify either with enraged Iraqis who must rise to such a taunt, or with young GIs who must now answer for it.  Even in relationships to his own soldiers, there is nothing at the core of this man but visceral meanness.\\"  He goes on to describe Bush as a \\"selfless president,\\" which he sees \\"not a compliment\\" but \\"a warning.\\" <br /> <br />One area where Carroll sharply criticizes the Bush Administration is in the misuse of intelligence.  Rather than seeking answers by following the facts wherever they may lead and formulating policy based on those hardheaded, realistic conclusions, he sees the Bush Administration as tailoring circumstances to fit its own desires.  Under such circumstances policies are motivated by propaganda rather than intelligence assessments.  The classic illustration was the rush to war to protect Americans from a perceived attack in which Saddam Hussein would release \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" that never existed.  A UN inspection team's work was precluded in the rush to war.  <br /> <br />As a perceptive student of history, Carroll decries lost diplomatic opportunities that were lost at the conclusion of World War Two.  Rather than take the lead in seeking to put an end to the creation of nuclear weapons, the U.S. and Soviet Union instead entered into a protracted Cold War.  This brought the world to the precipice of destruction through a nuclear exchange.  A balance of terror was substituted for creative diplomacy and an objective of world disarmament.   <br /> <br />With the ability of terrorists to make small nuclear weapons that can be carried in a suitcase, and the corresponding capability of unleashing widespread destruction, Carroll sees the futility of the Bush Administration pursuing Star Wars technology.  The strategy of the Bush Administration to abrogate international treaties pertaining to arms control and polluting the atmosphere is viewed in the context of the potential disaster that could result for the entire planet from such selfish policies.  At a time when well-reasoned diplomacy is essential a lone cowboy \\"bring `em on\\" foolhardy policy with potential cataclysmic results has instead been invoked as primitive emotion supplants reason.	2005-07-04

Bush agree is over the assertion made by the latter that \\"America has been changed forever by the tragedy of 9-11.\\"  From that point forward Van Bergen, an attorney active in the South Florida branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Bush travel widely disparate ideological paths. <br /> <br />Van Bergen shrewdly delineates the path traveled by the Bush Administration in the wake of September 11, 2001 as it declared war against terrorism and sought to acquire powers held by chief executives in totalitarian states and denied them in democratic nations.  Only Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California voted against granting the executive branch the sweeping powers it sought in the wake of 9-11 as the House and Senate voted in an otherwise unanimous manner. <br /> <br />One important point that Van Bergen makes that has been mentioned all too infrequently is that the entire war on terror announced by Bush after 9-11, and used as an immediate basis to launch a fierce military attack in Afghanistan, is predicated on spurious constitutional and common law grounds.  In any military or police action a specific nation or organizational entity needs to be identified.  Bush's war on terror does not meet that important criterion since its fails the specificity test.   <br /> <br />As Van Bergen carefully delineates, by declaring war on a non-specific entity and stating that such a conflict has no measurable end in sight, the opportunity is ripe for an octopus-like executive branch to, in the interest of preserving democracy, bring about its demise in the interest of safeguarding the nation and its people from terrorism.  The instrument of accomplishment was the infamous Patriot Act, which left the Bill of Rights in tatters. <br /> <br />The sweeping arm of the law swooped down on innocent citizens and aliens in America who were Arabs and practiced Islam.  The umbrella expansiveness of the Patriot Act permitted them to arrest suspects without a warrant and detain them for non-specific periods of time without charging them.  The dangerous abrogation of rights extended beyond this slippery slope and into the constitutional guarantee of right of counsel.  In instances where attorneys were permitted to speak with such defendants, authorities were permitted to listen in on the conversations, rendering the privilege of counsel essentially null and void through destroying confidentiality.  Again, these tactics are hallmarks of totalitarianism and anathema to democracy. <br /> <br />A tactic used to circumvent dealing with defendants in traditional constitutional circumstances is to declare any individual suspected of terrorist acts or giving support to terrorist groups as enemy combatants.  This has been used in the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison to evade American constitutional or international safeguards such as the U.S. Constitution and the Geneva Code.  Democracy is denied on the pretext of saving the institution, a tragic contradiction through which freedoms have been trampled and America has come closer to representing apartheid South Africa than a constitutional democracy.    <br /> <br />In addition to laying out the legal case against the usurpation of democracy by the Bush Administration, Van Bergen also lists fourteen basic points cited earlier by Lawrence W. Britt as dangerous common threads associated with Fascism. <br /> <br />They include such totalitarian hallmarks as excessive nationalism, media control, pervasive scapegoating, obsession with militarism and national security, protection of corporations and denial of workers' basic rights, obsession with crime and punishment, rampant cronyism and corruption, and fraudulent elections.      <br /> <br />Americans should remember with caution the words spoken by Benjamin Franklin when he left Constitution Hall and was asked what kind of government had been bestowed on the new nation called America, t o which he responded, \\"A Republic if you can keep it.\\"    <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-21

There is something closely akin to this in financial markets.  It is the quest for the perfect stock.  Investors envision that ideal experience, and with one distinct difference between the financial dream and the quest for the perfect wave.  Investing in the perfect stock under the right circumstances can bring with it all those trappings of wealth, those champagne wishes and caviar dreams that Robin Leach spoke about in his hit television series of a few years ago, \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.\\" <br /> <br />Veteran financial analyst Brad Koteshwar in \\"The Perfect Stock\\" writes about the search for that dream among investors, the modern day equivalent of gold prospectors deluging California in the nineteenth century.  The book is based on how a 7000% move was set up, started and finished in an astounding 52 weeks, and what it took to bring about such a fantastic result. <br /> <br />Koteshwar's book would be worth reading for just a few of the homilies he passes along after a long background experience, but there is much more.  He examines the entire psychology behind the stock market and how shrewd analysts from the biggest companies, using superb marketing technology and incorporating investment ploys they hope those from outside their small orbit will never learn, benefit from this intelligently applied teamwork while the vast body of investors swept up in a continuing frenzy meet with economic failure. <br /> <br />The word Koteshwar stresses throughout and the one used by seasoned market professionals willing to share their knowledge with others is \\"patience.\\"  In the personal examples the author uses of individuals swept away in their pursuit of the perfect stock, Taser in this instance, the fictional one that the author tracks in his analysis of broad market impulses, this is the word that is either unspoken or, in the rare instances that it is, is considered anathema.   <br /> <br />It is understandable why these excited investors, swept along by an emotional tide, do not want to hear the word patience.  As Koteshwar points out, those marketing the stocks are aware of human nature and play their hand consistently in that direction.  The whole psychology behind American progress and innovation was predicated on taking a chance. Rather than waiting patiently, working diligently to achieve quick and comprehensive results, many believe that a jackpot stock market payoff lies just around the corner as long as an investor acts quickly.   <br /> <br />Knowing human psychology, marketing is shrewdly crafted to convince investors that opportunities are limited and that only the swiftest participants win the race.  It is therefore imperative to jump aboard at the earliest point.  Rather than encourage investors to study the book value of a company listed on the stock exchange to determine if there is commensurate real value behind the current price of the company under consideration, fast talking salesmen seek to convince potential investors that they will rue the day that they failed to act on opportunity if they do not move swiftly.   <br /> <br />This psychology is exploited in two different directions.  If the stock is relatively new, the promotion campaign is getting off the ground and activity is just commencing, then the argument is that one needs to get in on the ground floor as the stock is preparing to take off like a rocket.  If it has already been elevated in price and has been available for awhile the argument shifts to a more urgent, \\"You see how others have benefited.  Well, unless you jump aboard now you will lose your chance to get make big money on this stock and you will kick yourselves afterwards!\\" <br /> <br />What about situations where the stock is beginning a downhill slide?  A different argument is frequently posed.  We have no more than a correction in effect, and how lucky you are.  When the potential investor asks what is lucky about this scenario, the glib response is straight to the point.  Just look at how this stock performed earlier and how many people made money on it.  This ought to tell you its value.  Now that we have a little adjustment period and it is going down temporarily then the opportunity is ripe to climb on board at a lower price than during peak period.  You then need to wait for this previous moneymaker to return to its former winning ways.  This is the one scenario where patience is stressed, but in a self serving and less than candid way.   <br /> <br />Koteshwar provides examples of individuals who made money during the productively performing period of Taser, but then lost tremendously in the long run.  Rather than accept a modest profit they believed they could anticipate peak level.  Their incorrect guesses over how high the stock would go resulted in huge losses. <br /> <br />The author has his own online newsletter, which he began in 2001 during the height of a bear market, at breakout123.com.  He recommends a strategy of prudence coupled with arming oneself with knowledge of the market, which will hopefully serve as a protection against the dangers of emotional enthusiasm in the pursuit of quick riches.	2005-04-13

An interview with British director \\"Nipper\\" Lupino Lane, future star Ida Lupino's uncle, led to an invitation to work with him at Gainsborough Studios in London's Islington area.<br /><br />Before Guest knew it he was a director himself in the busy Gainsborough milieu, providing initial acting breaks to the likes of his friend Michael Rennie and Jean Simmons.  A star with whom he worked closely during the period was Margaret Lockwood, while his neighbor in the office next door for ten interesting years was none other than Alfred Hitchcock.  When Guest set sail for the comedy realm he hooked up with celebrated London funny man Will Hay.<br /><br />Film lovers will find this book a veritable feast chock full of anecdotes about London in an exciting era when Guest turned out products at a fantastic clip while helping in the war effort as well.  Some of the most interesting pages of the book relate to how Gainsborough film folk such as himself continued turning out movies to enhance British morale by day and risked their lives as volunteer fire fighters by night amid unrelenting attacks by Germany's crack air force, the Luftwaffe, during the Battle of Britain.  Guest chronicles how the British \\"stiff upper lip\\" was invoked through humor in the wake of attack as he swapped jokes with kindred spirit James Mason, the handsome and talented Yorkshire leading man, who also performed valuable night fire fighting duties.<br /><br />A key point of Guest's life surfaced when an American leading lady from New Jersey  took the West End by storm as she played to packed houses in Garson Kanin's comedy, \\"Born Yesterday.\\"  Guest ardently pursued dazzling blonde Yolande Donlan from the first time he saw her on stage and ultimately she became his wife.<br /><br />With Yolande Donlan so popular in Britain from her rousing stage success it was only natural for Guest to star her in films, and so he did.  In 1949 she starred opposite Michael Rennie in \\"Miss Pilgrim's Progress.\\"  One year later Guest directed Donlan in \\"The Body Said No\\" opposite Rennie and in \\"Mr. Drake's Duck\\" in which she appeared opposite another of Guest's long time friends from the London scene, Douglas Fairbanks Jr.<br /><br />The fifties proved to be a highly productive decade for Guest as he worked with such celebrated performers in British productions as Bette Davis, Dirk Bogarde, Frankie Howerd, Peter Sellers, Ben Lyon and Bebe Daniels, Laurence Harvey, and Leo McKern.<br /><br />In the sixties Guest also remained intensely busy, becoming an in demand globe trotting director and screenwriter.  In 1961 his British production \\"The Day the Earth Caught Fire\\" with Janet Munro and Leo McKern resulted in him winning a British Academy Award for Best Screenplay.  He recounts sitting at the Dorchester Hotel on award night  next to a fellow nervous nominee who won as director in the Best Documentary category, a young filmmaker named John Schlesinger who would soon become famous for such films as \\"Darling\\", \\"The Midnight Cowboy\\" and \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\".<br /><br />In 1963 Guest scored one of his most impressive triumphs as he directed and wrote the screenplay for \\"80,000 Suspects\\" under his own production banner.  The film was set in scenic and historic Bath and starred Claire Bloom and Richard Johnson along with Yolande Donlan.<br /><br />The sixties was the decade of James Bond and Guest moved successfully with the tide as he produced, directed, and wrote the screenplay for the 1964 release \\"Where the Spies Are\\" with David Niven and Francois Dorleac.  In 1966 he directed along with John Huston, Kenneth Hughes, Robert Parrish, and Joseph McGrath the James Bond spy spoof \\"Casino Royale\\" with an all star cast that included Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, David Niven, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, Charles Boyer, and Jean-Paul Belmondo.<br /><br />In 1971 Guest was approached by producer Robert Baker to direct \\"The Persuaders\\" television series starring Roger Moore and Tony Curtis.

His specialty is tax policy and his latest work, \\"Start Your Own Tax-Exempt Think Tank\\" is both an instructive guide as to how the powerful became much more so at the distinct expense of the middle class as well as how to correct these appalling disadvantages through self-help. <br /> <br />Early in the book Kinau provides information on tax refunds received by America's leading corporations in the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy Report's \\"Corporate Income Taxes in the 1990s\\" which furnishes grist to make the blood of middle class taxpayers boil.  For instance, in 1998 Pepsico, Pfizer, and MCI WorldCom all received whopping tax refunds to put them in negative territory where the tax collector was concerned.   <br /> <br />If you want to talk about specific numbers, Kinau has them.  For instance, Lyondell Chemical finished 1998 with a minus 55 percent rate.  Texaco and Chevron also received lavish windfalls as the oil giants ended in negative territory at 37.2 and 26.4 percent respectively in the tax rate department. <br /> <br />The message embraced by Kinau is easily summarized in one succinct sentence:  \\"Stop subsidizing wealthy individuals and tax-dodging corporations.\\"  Since the Reagan era income wage earners are paying a substantially increased share of the total U.S. tax burden.  What we have seen from so-called public officials in Washington is a buddy plan for the wealthy.  Leading corporations fund campaigns and their ardent lobbyists on Capitol Hill promptly collect on benefits and services received.  This dangerous trend toward socialism for the rich has substantially increased under the Cheney-Bush Administration.  As has been noted, George W. Bush is a huge corporation operating under the guise of a single individual.   <br /> <br />The author provides a game plan for Americans tired of making up vast differences pocketed in \\"tax relief\\" for thenation's leading corporations.  Noting that speakers on right wing advocacy group Fox News come from various think tanks in which tax benefits are received by those propagating the \\"greed is good\\" syndrome, he advocates that exploited taxpayers develop an effective game plan of their own to combat blatant exploitation for the benefit of the rich.   <br /> <br />Kinau recommends that frustrated American taxpayers start their own tax-exempt think tanks.  He sees the benefits as twofold, economic reimbursement in the face of financing corporate largesse at a discriminatory level and turning the tables on the propagandists by using the newly created think tanks as platforms espousing tax justice at long last. <br /> <br />The nuts and bolts aspects of how to start such a think tank are covered in meticulous detail in \\"Start Your Own Tax-Exempt Think Tank\\" as government forms are reprinted, along with instructions on how to answer questions relating to the start up process.   <br /> <br />The message presented in this book is refreshingly straightforward.  The Institute for Public Research identifies the problem squarely in one pungent paragraph: <br /> <br />\\"President Bush's team of economic advisors drawn from top universities, corporations, and conservative policy think tanks are driving down the road toward privatizing Social Security and reforming the tax system.  America's middle income taxpayers are scampering for new ways to avoid becoming road kill.\\" <br /> <br />Think of that term, so brief and powerful - \\"road kill.\\"  This is tragically what is happening as the nation's debt gallops toward the perilous $8 trillion mark with no end in sight as corporations reek a harvest and lobbyists gloat while an increasing number of Americans fight to avoid being \\"road kill\\" victims of corporate greed running amok.	2005-03-18

She was shocked to learn that her mother, a vital woman in her sixties, had been infected with the AIDS virus.  She provides a compelling account of her experiences in dealing with AIDS along with those of her mother in \\"A Burden of Silence:  My Mother's Battle with AIDS\\".     Nancy's mother had received blood from a contaminated pool from New York City while receiving a blood transfusion.  Those with knowledge of this tragedy failed to pass along word.  Tragically, certain individuals in authority placed a premium on protecting themselves and not providing vital information to family members, beginning with Nancy's father.    Having been dealt this terrible blow, Nancy Draper summoned all the courage and energy at her disposal to help her mother through her travail.  A former teacher and current piano instructor, Nancy plainly likes people and has an essentially optimistic viewpoint which shows through in her writing.  She was therefore stunned to observe that so many with whom she dealt in the health care field, rather than displaying the type of caring compassion toward Nancy's mother that her situation warranted, instead sadly operated at a cold distance.      When Nancy sought answers on how to ease her mother's painful burden she sometimes received more of a shrug than helpful assistance.  Incredibly, in one instance when she took her mother to a doctor's office, he remained seated and did not even get up to acknowledge their presence.  Such conduct is a long step downward from the teachings of Hippocrates.     This book represents a straightforward account of Nancy Draper's experiences without any punches being pulled, and as such there were negative experiences as well as, thankfully, positive ones as well.  At a time when Nancy's mother needed a game plan to reduce the level of pain she was forced to endure the caring figure of Dr. Ann Webster emerged.  As the director of the HIV/AIDS Program at the Mind/Body Institute in Boston, Dr. Webster made available the most updated treatment in the new and rapidly expanding holistic treatment area.  \\"Nancy has given her mother's story a voice,\\" Dr Webster stated regarding \\"Burden of Silence\\", adding, \\"There are lessons for everyone in this book - lessons about acceptance, compassion, and forgiveness.\\"    Ann Pozen, Psy.D., president of the National Association for Victims of Transfusion-Acquired AIDS, Inc., of Bethesda, Maryland, also provided a solid endorsement of \\"Burden of Silence\\":    \\"Nancy Draper has written a tender account of a daughter's devotion to her dying mother.  The story, about a grandmother who developed AIDS from a contaminated blood transfusion, will inspire admiration for Ms. Draper's courage and persistence.  It will also inspire rage against the blood banks that failed to screen blood donations adequately.\\"    In addition to assisting Nancy's mother in the important holistic medicine area, seeking to ease the physical and mental pain she confronted, the act of bonding was also essential.  During her mother's ordeal as well as the painful period following her death Nancy Draper found additional strength through interaction.      One of the most positive and impressive elements of her story is the message that strength can be acquired through reaching out with full sensitivity toward those in a comparable situation.  She writes movingly about one such instance when she met a woman on an airplane who had lost a brother to AIDS.  They were able to provide needed comfort to one another, which was extended even further by group interaction.      Draper correctly points out the terrible mistakes made in analyzing AIDS.  She notes painfully how many people she knew shunned dealing with her mother and other AIDS patients for fear that even a touch may subject them to the disease.  Another point well made was how long the federal government dragged its feet before speaking out officially about AIDS.  It was not until 1987 that President Ronald Reagan even mentioned AIDS while numerous cases were being regularly reported from the early eighties.    The author relates to the tragedy of pernicious ignorance as a factor in hardening feelings toward AIDS patients.  Those familiar with the eighties recall the thundering denunciations of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson in which they bluntly stated that AIDS sufferers were being punished for their sins.  Their voices were immediately silenced after statistics poured in from Africa revealing enormous numbers of AIDS cases involving heterosexuals.  Due to the substantial weight losses of sufferers, the disease became known as Slims throughout Africa.    After devoting a section to hospice care and the role it played during her mother's final days Nancy addresses the present and the future.  She is proud of having contributed to the international AIDS quilt.  In so doing she has kept her mother's name alive as well as joining hands with others who have suffered from AIDS by giving their lives and through empathizing with deaths of relatives and friends.      As Nancy Draper effectively argues, AIDS is a disease that should not prompt us to sweep it fearfully under the rug as we atrophy in a well of ignorance.  Any of us could acquire AIDS, it should remain a paramount concern to all citizens of the world community, and together we must march forward to demand the maximum in research and commitment toward finding a cure.	2005-03-02

The ultimate result was the writing and publication of \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,\\" one of the most important critiques of global economics to surface in some time. <br /> <br />Shortly after leaving Boston University John Perkins was groomed in the late sixties to become an economic hit man.  His journey began as a member of the Peace Corps where, ironically, rather than enhancing the lives of the indigenous Indian peoples of the Ecuadorian Amazon, the rain forest, and the Andes, the experience proves to be a stepping stone to another important position in which the objectives were anything but altruistic.  Global corporate giant MAIN assigned Perkins to a new position.  He returned home to Boston, where an attractive young woman taught him the ropes as she bluntly informed him that he was being groomed to become an economic hit man. <br /> <br />Perkins soon learned that the role he was assigned to play was one in which he posed as a friend to peoples of other nations, only to serve as an enthusiastic promoter of the World Bank and its loan policy to underdeveloped nations.  He meets Robert McNamara, then the World Bank's president, and is promoted rapidly through the ranks by preparing reports that masquerade as frank economic assessments but in reality are propaganda messages extolling the loan process of the World Bank. <br /> <br />The resulting process is simple and devastating.  Heads of governments are implored to take out huge loans, all the while setting into motion a kickback process enabling cooperating heads of state to pocket enough to make themselves fabulously wealthy at the expense of the general citizenry.  When thenational treasuries are unable to keep up with exorbitant payment schedules the global economy barons exert control by taking charge as the corporate world assumes command, led by giants such as multinational Bechtel.  In the process the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  Perkins was on hand as the rain forest was plundered, causing him to develop grave misgivings about the predatory enterprise of which he was a part. <br /> <br />One head of state Perkins met, became a friend of, and greatly admired was President Omar Torrijos of Panama.  He established a working relationship with Torrijos in which beneficial construction services were provided that aided the Panamanian economy and its people.  Torrijos was a vanguard in seeking to have the Panama Canal turned over to the country where it was situated.  This happened but not long thereafter the incoming Reagan Administration exhibited grave misgivings about the treaty signed by President Jimmy Carter and Torrijos.   <br /> <br />Perkins holds deep suspicions about the plane crash that took Torrijos's life in 1981.  That same year another leader who had impressed Perkins with his selfless pursuit of economic justice for his people, President Jaime Roldos of Ecuador, who successfully campaigned for election on an anti-oil platform, also lost his life in a plane crash.  Perkins states bluntly that both \\"fiery airplane crashes ... have all the markings of CIA assassinations.\\" <br /> <br />Perkins is highly familiar with the manner in which the CIA intervenes on behalf of the global corporate community.  He provides details on how CIA operative Archie Roosevelt, Theodore's grandson, launched a successful coup in Iran to overthrow the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mossadegh after he had moved to nationalize the nation's oil deposits in retaliation for what the incoming president deemed exploitation of the nation's natural resources by the predecessor of British Petroleum.  This brought to power theShah of Iran, seen as a reliable bulwark of western economic interests.  It was the Shah who initiated a repressive secret police known as SAVAK, which in turn infuriated large segments of the Iranian people, leading to his ultimate overthrow and the installation of the Islamic fundamentalist Ayatollah Khomeini regime. <br /> <br />Another important area covered by Perkins was the CIA's activities in Guatemala under the democratically elected government of President Jacobo Arbenz.  When Arbenz instituted reform at a point when a few large commercial interests and families controlled the vast majority of land, with less than 3 percent of Guatemalans owning 70 percent of Guatemala's terra firma, he was stoutly opposed by the United Fruit Company, one of Guatemala's leading landholders.  A propaganda campaign was launched accusing Arbenz of being a Communist agitator.  A CIA campaign brought him down.  A repressive right wing totalitarian government replete with death squads replaced the popular Arbenz.     <br /> <br />It took tremendous courage for Perkins, a former consummate corporate insider, to pen a volume citing the gross misconduct and international power plays of the CIA as well as the rapacious dealings of the International Monetary Fund in concert with the World Bank.  This book should serve as a wakeup call to the international community among those who seek justice and oppose exploitation of people in the interest of serving the cause of international monopolistic greed.      <br /> <br />	2005-02-21

Books	5	16	23	N	N	A Man Wrongly Accused Seeks Justice	First time Denver novelist Whitfield Grant is off to a roaring start with his page turning thriller \\"Railroaded!\\"  The literary world needs more authors who know the African American experience and can write about it knowledgeably within the circumference of telling a rousing yarn.  Grant has amply fulfilled both of those criteria.     Tony Williams is happily married and a solid family man.  He is a respected member of the African American community who uses wealth and fame in seeking to help those of all colors and creeds who have been less privileged.  An Olympic gold medal sprinter and the greatest safety in the National Football League as a member of the seventies' dynasty Pittsburgh Steelers, Williams seems to have things going his way until one fateful day, when everything changes.    When Williams is in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl a teammate asks him to do him a favor by taking a slender blonde off his hands at a party.  He lets the promiscuous teammate know that he is committed to his wife and is told that all he has to do is dance with her.      What the teammate does not know is Tony's painful secret.  While growing up in racially tense rural Alabama in the sixties he sees his own cousin lynched by Ku Klux Klan members for making a pass at a white woman.  The incident traumatized him long after moving with his family to Los Angeles.    Tony rejects the young woman's blatant attempt to bed her down.  This is no surprise considering his loyalty to his wife along with the traumatic experience he envisioned in early youth concerning interracial sexual conflict.  He later sees the blonde again after having imbibed too much liquor.  She offers to ostensibly help him back to his hotel room and nothing more.  Tony falls asleep and later disturbing pictures surface showing the two of them lying next to each other.  The pictures along with inflammatory letters alleging that Tony's heart belongs to this woman are sent to his crestfallen wife.    It will be Tony Williams's grave misfortune to ultimately learn that the young woman in question is none other than the spoiled daughter of the man who employs him.  She is Marianne Scott, daughter of the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who also happens to be the richest man in Pennsylvania.    First Tony sustains an illegal crack back block that threatens his career in an exhibition game, learning that the hit man delivering the blow was Marianne's college lover.  That is only the beginning as the vindictive, spoiled rich girl's next move in her \\"hell hath no fury\\" vengeance is to accuse Tony Williams of rape.    The accusation rocks the entire city of Pittsburgh, throwing it into turmoil.  The episode builds into an O.J. Simpson trial of the late seventies.  Assisting Tony in attempting to prove his innocence are his soul brothers and two closest friends, fellow world-class sprinters Errol Forrest and Adrian Christopher, who initially met while in school in Los Angeles.    With Williams such a well-known personality in Pittsburgh, and considering the status of his accuser, various forces are brought into play.  A prominent judge seeking elevation to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court bluntly learns that he can profit handsomely by seeking to railroad Williams at trial along with receiving the job promotion he covets.    Casting a Darth Vader type presence over unfolding activities is the man they call Viper.  Guy Markham as \\"Viper\\" is a trained assassination expert, having learned his \\"craft\\" initially as a Navy Seal.  When he becomes the chief investigator for the defense legal team he takes advantage of the opportunity to sell out his client.  Viper is not accustomed to losing and before the book concludes he initiates acts of violence with a chilling ripple effect that prompts readers to turn pages with increasing anticipation.    Grant has a knack rare for a first time novelist of pushing the right buttons to keep the action flowing at a swift pace.  He provides just the right amount of facts and character interaction to keep his readers wondering what will happen next as they await the story's next surprise turn.	2005-02-07

Books	5	1	1	N	N	How Insiders Make Billions	Sean Hewitt is an experienced New York trader who knows the ropes and shares much of his knowledge in this fascinating work that brings a touch of John Le Carre to the hectic current high stakes financial scene.  The book is a work of fiction weaving elements common in real life and frequently engaged in by top professionals.  Hewitt shows that there is much more to achieving wealth than the \\"virtue and hard work\\" superficial answers supplied by a series of guests on the famous television program \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\\". <br /> <br />Hewitt's scenario begins when a successful crude oil trader residing in the New York City bedroom community of Westchester gets a call from an old friend, who since their college days has worked himself into the position of White House Chief of Staff.  The third member of the college old boys' friends network was none other than the current President of the United States.   <br /> <br />The New York Mercantile Exchange trader is stunned to receive the call and is soon enough alerted that it is being made at the behest of the President.  He wants the trader to meet an influential Saudi friend of the chief executive's at the Waldorf Astoria bar for drinks.  At that point more will be revealed. <br /> <br />The trader learns that the Saudi wants him to open an account on his behalf.  The Saudi stresses secrecy at every turn, revealing that the matter is of the utmost importance to his old college friend the President. <br /> <br />When the trader establishes the account we are provided with an education in the ebb and flow of New York Mercantile Exchange activity in the crude oil field.  The Westchester trader has achieved a record of enviable success due to his caution.  He is anything but the wild cowboy \\"go for broke\\" character immortalized in numerous films who stakes everything at a Las Vegas crapshoot.  This trader is a cautious fine tuner.  His game plan calls for him to stop action at a certain point whether he is betting high or low. <br /> <br />Gradually, as the crude oil market escalates, the trader makes a fortune for his Saudi client as well as himself on his commissions.  During the same period his old friend the President is engaged in a very uphill battle for reelection.  Albeit the fact that he is personally benefiting from the substantial upswing in crude oil, he frets that the President will be victimized by those price forces and lose the election in the wake of consumer fury over the escalating price of oil at the nation's gas tanks. <br /> <br />Hewitt reveals how the scenario eventually plays to the advantage of the market forces he represents as well as the President.  An \\"external event\\" in the form of an October Surprise, occurs and changes the face of the political climate.  To reveal more would be to spoil the rousing surprise ending the author has in store for readers.  It can be said, however, that they should conclude that when it comes to the barons of wealth and their control of money as well as political events, it is manifestly possible to \\"have one's cake and eat it too.\\" <br /> <br />Hewitt concludes with a grim and unerringly accurate view of machinations within the economic-political world: <br /> <br />\\"   The President did not care about the man on the street.  Just how many CEOs care about the man working the assembly line?  The man at the top signed his own paychecks along with his buddies who were all on the company's board.  And they had made enough money to last many many generations of decadent living.  The likes of Ken Lay, Bernie Ebbers, Dennis Koszlowski and Dick Grasso littered the American corporate landscape.  The President was running the power structure of the country as if he were a CEO, but he was running the finances of the country like a trust-fund teenager would run his accounts - recklessly.  Greed had gripped the American elite.  And they became blind to the gathering storms.\\" <br /> <br />Hewitt's professionalism grasped thesituation in totality.  He puts his experience to work in this powerful volume to issue a warning to Americans before we are blindsided one time too many and there is nothing left to pick from a once bountiful economic tree.	2005-02-05
US	52389304	R2WWJUH91J4UP	0972020705	876427741	America's Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull & Bones	Books	5	170	180	N	N	Skull and Bones Updated to Bush and Kerry	Antony Sutton in writing \\"America's Secret Establishment\\" two decades ago set in motion the analytical wherewithal for tracing its activities beyond his death.  Sutton may be dead, but the important questions he raised about Skull and Bones and this secret society's impact on U.S. and world political and economic policies become more paramount with each passing year. <br /> <br />The 2004 presidential election was the first in history to pit two members of Yale University's super secretive Skull and Bones society against each other.  In this case the word \\"against\\" may well prove to be a figure of speech.  To quote the legendary British author Lewis Carroll, the 2004 race may well be proven historically to be, despite its feints and dodges in an effort to attain legitimacy, \\"a battle between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.\\"   <br /> <br />Some scrutinizing individuals, mindful of Sutton's work in this and other works indicating that often the left theoretically represented by the Democrats and the right theoretically represented by the Republicans are merely two wings of the same bird, representing the same establishment while going through the motions of seemingly democratic competition.  These individuals were scoffed at in the same manner as those who were skeptical of the Warren Commission Report following its release, being denounced as \\"conspiracy buffs.\\"  The mainstream media denounces those who continue to pursue evidence of cheating in the 2004 presidential election in Ohio, Florida, New Mexico and elsewhere as \\"spreadsheet conspiracy theorists.\\" <br /> <br />While belittling skeptics who wondered if democracy might well be seriously jeopardized by two Skull and Bones candidates vying for the presidency, it is insightful to note what occurred when Bush, seeking a four year extension after his highly controversial \\"victory\\" four years earlier against Al Gore by a one vote margin in the U.S. Supreme Court, was asked about Skull and Bones.  \\"I can't say anything about that,\\" Bush responded with a nervous expression in contrast to his widely reputed swaggering manner. <br /> <br />Sutton acknowledges that he had inside sources providing his information on Skull and Bones.  An established element is that members are sworn to secrecy.  The question should be asked:  Does the vow of secrecy presumably taken by both Bush and Kerry supersede any implied covenant with the American people to operate on its behalf as part of what is labeled a democratic nation?  Do Skull and Bones pledges of secrecy apply to the \\"new democracy\\" Bush and his neoconservative operatives led by Dick Cheney purport to be building in Iraq and throughout the Middle East? <br /> <br />Sutton's conclusions dovetail with those of other courageous authors seeking to pierce the Skull and Bones veil of secrecy.  As Sutton notes, prospective pledges are contacted in their junior years and, if accepted, belong to the organization only one year at Yale as seniors.   <br /> <br />Contrasting Skull and Bones with other fraternal organizations, Sutton points out the important distinction of obtaining pledges for only the final critical year at Yale, whereas fraternities are known for seeking pledges as freshmen.  Sutton's point is well taken, that the reason for concentrating on seniors is the focus on their lives beyond Yale.  As John Huston, playing a corrupt corporate magnate who controls Los Angeles in the 1974 film \\"Chinatown\\" replies in response to a question from private detective Jake Gittes, played by Jack Nicholson, as to why he is so power hungry when he is able to buy anything he could ever reasonably want: \\"The future, Mr. Gittes, the future!\\"    <br /> <br />The future appears to have been well taken care of by the coalescing of Skull and Bones members.  Sutton explains that the organization follows the dialectical line of reasoning of German philosopher Hegel, in which 1) thesis and 2) antithesis are ultimately integrated into 3) synthesis.  He points outthat this is what makes otherwise contradictory behavior explainable, such as major Wall Street brokerage firms such as Brown Brothers-Harriman, where George W. Bush's grandfather Prescott worked alongside famous Democratic Party name Averell Harriman as needed funds were supplied to both Hitler's Third Reich and Stalin's Soviet Union. <br /> <br />Follow Sutton's line of reasoning and fill in the blanks.  It makes the seemingly politically incomprehensible emerge as highly plausible and chillingly prescient.	2005-01-10

During Koufax's early years he was drawn to basketball and was playing the hoop sport at Cincinnati University when major league franchises became aware of his natural skills in throwing a baseball. <br /> <br />Koufax ultimately signed to play for the home team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, but before he could find his stride the team had moved three thousand miles west to Los Angeles.  Sandy was a victim of his time in signing a bonus contract.  Rules obligated clubs to make room on their rosters for youngsters, creating resentment from established players and lacking the opportunity to develop provided to others in the minor leagues. <br /> <br />The young lefty would have preferred beginning in the minors.  Instead he had a long, hard climb before breaking into the Dodger rotation.  Years later he would ask former Dodger general manager Buzzie Bavasi why he was not used sooner on a regular basis.  He never could get over those early years of feeling management did not want him. <br /> <br />As typical of a southpaw with blazing speed, Koufax was plagued by wildness.  When he was able to overcome it he carried pitching to new heights.  Former Yankee manager Casey Stengel, a veteran judge of talent and by then skipper of the New York Mets, said, \\"The Jewish kid is better than Walter Johnson.\\" <br /> <br />Washington Post sportswriter Jane Leavy captures Koufax and his times by interviewing scores of those who knew him from his Bensonhurst days to the present.  She keeps two interesting narratives flowing in her text, alternating between the Koufax biography and an exceptionally detailed, fascinating account of the September 9, 1965 perfect game Koufax pitched at Dodger Stadium against opposing hurler Bob Hendley and the Chicago Cubs.The game was doubly fascinating in that it came close to being a double no hitter in that Hendley gave up only a scratch blooper single to Dodger outfielder Lou Johnson, who had earlier scored the game's only run.  The run occurred after Johnson had walked, been bunted to second, stolen third and run home following a throwing error by Cubs' rookie catcher Chris Krug.   <br /> <br />To Koufax and those who followed him, the breaks he received to enable him to win his perfect game in a regulation nine innings were payback.  In his initial World Series start in game five in Los Angeles of the 1959 match up with another Chicago team, the White Sox, Koufax performed brilliantly in a pitcher's duel with Bob Shaw in which the game's only run was scored by Nellie Fox while the Dodgers executed a double play. <br /> <br />As someone who had a rare gift of throwing a baseball at tremendous speeds and velocity a Catch-22 resulted.  The act of repeatedly engaging in such a physically unnatural feat resulted in debilitating injury.   <br /> <br />At the peak of his career teammates could barely stand to look at Koufax's grotesquely swollen left arm following a game.  He quit at the end of the 1966 season, realizing he would never be able to use his left arm eventually and would be in acute pain regularly if he did not hang up his cleats.  He racked up Hall of Fame statistics and was able to retire at the youthful age of 30.  When most players quit it is after their peak skills have sharply eroded.  Despite enduring increasing pain Koufax's final year was his best as he chalked up a career high of 27 wins against 9 losses wth a sparkling 1.73 earned run average. <br /> <br />Author Leavy provides sharp insight into a joint act engaged in with the Dodgers' top right-handed starter Don Drysdale that changed Major League Baseball permanently.  Up until 1966 team owners held a commanding advantage over players.  After Roger Maris,  broke Babe Ruth's home run record with 61 round trippers in 1961, he sought to bring his businessman brother to Yankee Stadium to help negotiate the following year's contract. The Yankees declined to allow him to sit in on the meeting. <br /> <br />In the cases of Koufax and Drysdale, General Manager Bavasi and the top Dodger brass previously used psychology to play the star pitchers off against each other.  If Koufax walked into a negotiating session and a contract was mentioned with opposition, Bavasi would respond, \\"That's funny because Drysdale said he would accept that amount.\\"  He would do the same when Drysdale appeared for a contract discussion. <br /> <br />Drysdale's wife Ginger posed the suggestion that the players jointly negotiate their 1966 contracts.  They decided to negotiate as a team, and as holdouts had to convince management that they were willing if necessary to abandon their careers.  At one point they both signed to appear as actors in the suspense film \\"Warning Shot\\" starring David Janssen.  Before shooting started, however, management saw the light.  After all, it was a proven fact that more fans materialized when they pitched.  It was said that Koufax drew an extra 10,000 customers when he took the mound as a starter. <br /> <br />The daring Koufax-Drysdale negotiating ploy was the first major step in what would result in the creation of a Players Association headed by lawyer Marvin Miller.  Koufax and Drysdale would accordingly be classified as labor heroes whose efforts assisted those players who followed them into the major leagues.	2004-12-29
US	52389304	R1QY1ELBD1VRKV	0740747177	591332204	Ghosts Among Us: True Stories of Spirit Encounters	Books	5	43	45	N	N	A Fascinating Topic Thoroughly Explored	Leslie Rule is the daughter of bestselling true crime author Ann Rule.  Her definitive research and crisply written prose revealed in \\"Ghosts Among Us\\" are characteristics of her mother's exhaustive efforts in comprehensively covering the true crime scene by communicating her information in a manner both folksy and readable. <br /> <br />\\"Ghosts Among Us\\" marks the author as an important pioneer in a fascinating and rapidly evolving field of parapsychology.  The numbers of skeptics, some of whom sought to ridicule the topic of ghosts, have sharply diminished through the efforts of authors such as Leslie Rule, who have demonstrated that many credible people have had encounters with beings in situations that cannot be explained through traditional human analysis. <br /> <br />Having been born and raised in Seattle, it is fitting for Rule to launch her exploration at the colorful Pike Place Outdoor Market.  Located in downtown Seattle, the market attracts not only scores of people from the Pacific Northwest and throughout the rest of the world; explorations reveal that ghosts have been known to visit as well.  Numerous reports of such visits by scores of individuals from disparate walks of life have been related about such appearances. <br /> <br />Rule's extensive research effort took her to all parts of America from Washington to upstate New York and into Canada.  As well as reporting on numerous cases, she provides photos of some of the more interesting hotels, restaurants, and mansions where apparitions were seen.  An element of her effort that readers should greatly appreciate is that, in addition to researching the cases thoroughly, she invites interested individuals to follow up on their own.  She provides address and website information, as well as mentioning names of individuals involved at the various locations discussed. <br /> <br />While conceding that she had never encountered an experience like the individuals she interviewed, who reported clear views ofghostly apparitions; she reports that at one site she received a tug on the shoulder.  The two women who were accompanying Leslie were too far away to have touched her.  The contact was and remains unexplained.  In another instance she heard sounds of laughter while traversing stairs in the darkness of a hotel at a late hour.  Leslie later learned that there was no apparent human activity at that time and that the laughter was a common occurrence during late hours. <br /> <br />A common thread of Rule's efforts revealed that the appearances of the beings observed frequently lived at the locations where the sightings occurred.  The belief is that their spirits extend beyond their human lives.  In one instance a short, jolly, white-haired woman, greeted a man at a bed and breakfast.  When she offered to make him breakfast he declined, feeling somewhat eerie about the meeting.  Shortly afterward he encountered the woman who ran the establishment, who told him calmly that the woman he met was her deceased mother, who made frequent appearances to guests.   <br /> <br />My interest was seized by one particularly interesting account near the end of the book, the activities at the old Lemp Mansion in St. Louis.  It was once the opulent family home of the famous Lemp family of local brewery fame and is now in operation as a bed and breakfast as well as a restaurant.  A ghost haunts not only the establishment, but nearby neighbors, especially those living next door.  The object of interest is called Monkey Boy, believed to be the spirit of a deformed child trapped in the building's attic.  He is often seen through a window by next door neighbors.   <br /> <br />One of the most fascinating revelations of Rule's book is the story of famous Philadelphia forensic sculptor Frank Bender.  He has supplied the FBI and numerous American police agencies with sculptures of victims in instances where corpses found long after their death need to be identified.  She recounts the incidentwhen Bender, with very little to work with, provided uncannily accurate facial details of a woman who had been killed by her husband with assistance from the victim's sister.  The man had taken out a large life insurance policy on his ultimate victim.  The murderers believed they had succeeded until Bender provided the necessary information to determine that there had been a homicide and the body discovered was that of the victim.  While Bender explains his uncanny detail work in the frequent face of at best scant supportive physical data as intuition, Rule wonders if something more is not involved, in that ghosts have been known to have worked from the great beyond to provide information as well as communicate verbally in certain situations. <br /> <br />Rule's book harkens back to the successful \\"Unsolved Mysteries\\" program narrated by Robert Stack.  That show provided a slant that was both reportorial as well as folksy, attempting to take viewers into the world of the paranormal and the individuals reporting their experiences with rich and vivid details.

It was Parry who uncovered significant evidence pertaining to the October Surprise incident.  His efforts ultimately reached the nation's viewers with a heralded Public Broadcasting System documentary produced by his organization, Consortium News, which has emerged as one of the Internet's leading sources of information not generally available from mainstream media sources. <br /> <br />Parry covers the emergence of the Bush dynasty from a different perspective than those previously traversed.  Parry stresses the necessity of George H. W. Bush, the first of two Bushes to sit in the White House, in clearing away potential mine fields of disaster to his son and the Republican Party in general.  Parry reveals how Bush the Elder's concerted efforts resulted in the dodging of a political bullet in the form of the October Surprise allegations that could have seriously undercut Republican influence in the future and cost them dearly at the polls.   <br /> <br />In addition to Bush the Elder's efforts, Republicans were bolstered by the fact that influential Democrats such as Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana agreed to scuttle the October Surprise investigation after earlier hearings had been held.  Parry cites this result as comparable to the termination of efforts to learn more about the Watergate tragedy after Robert Strauss, the closest friend of Democrat-turned-Republican and Nixon Cabinet member John Connally.  When Strauss became Chairman of the Democratic National Committee following Senator George McGovern's loss to Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential election, he used his influence to ultimately tamp down the flames of Watergate, as did George H. W. Bush, who had been appointed Chairman of the Republican National Committee by Nixon. <br /> <br />Crack researcher Parry covers the pivotal Iran-Contra period with insightful diligence.  Once more Congressman Lee Hamilton was there to coalesce with Republicans to blunt the efforts to learn the basics of the Iran-Contra scandal.  Bush insisted that he was \\"out of the loop\\" and uninvolved in the grimy details of the arms for hostages swap culminating in arms for the rebel Nicaraguan Contras.  It was eventually learned that Bush was lying, but the truth did not come out until after he defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election. <br /> <br />Much of this informative work provides vital information on how the CIA has become a major political tool in providing cover-ups for Republicans while destroying those who seek to uncover corruption.  By the time the Republicans resorted to dirty tricks to secure victory for George W. Bush in 2000 after he had lost the presidential popular vote to Al Gore, cronies of the elder Bush, spearheaded by his former Secretary of State James Baker, were in place to perform duties.   <br /> <br />It was also interesting to observe how son emulated father in keeping a lid on information that could prove damaging to the administrations of Bush the Elder and Ronald Reagan.  George W. Bush issued an executive order denying the National Archives from continuing its traditional function of placing information from past presidential administrations in the public domain.    <br /> <br />A central thesis of Parry's book is that these cover-up efforts by the CIA, which the elder Bush once headed, could not have been successful without the tacit cooperation of a national media that has become submissive to Republican authority.  He demonstrates how tremendously one-sided the mainstream media was in the 2000 election in leveling repeated charges at Al Gore for failing to tell the truth, using statements taken out of context to achieve this purpose, while essentially looking the other way in the face of evidence of corruption and deception by George W. Bushand his running mate, Dick Cheney.	2004-12-14

This is the case with writers of insight, and master essayist Vidal certainly fulfills that criterion. <br /> <br />He points out ironically at the end of this fast-paced volume, a collection of some of his most stirring recent essays, how the Republican propaganda machine combined with the mainstream media are so apt to use terms such as \\"left wing\\" and \\"radical\\" for individuals who in any objective context would be classified as \\"thoughtful conservatives.\\"  He uses this label to describe Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich in his presidential bid.  It was Kucinich and those who supported him who sought to conserve the best of America, its resources, its economic opportunities, a rational foreign policy based on international cooperation, while the Bush Administration represents the ultimate in revolutionary radicalism with a strong rightist connection. <br /> <br />Vidal decries the fact that America has gone the route of Empire, a process dramatically heightened under the Administration he refers to as the Cheney-Bush Junta.  Vidal contends that the Democratic Party in its anxiety to blend with the corporate establishment, an occupational necessity on the part of those seeking to achieve and hold onto elective offices, has morphed with the rapacious Republicans to the point where an octopus has resulted, bereft of democratic tendencies, with the objective of marching to the tune established by the top one percent of asset holders of the population. <br /> <br />The author sums up Bush succinctly in one short and insightful essay entitled, appropriately, \\"Armageddon.\\"  He begins by writing about Ronald Reagan and how his affability and ability to deliver a speech convincingly led him to be a favorite of an establishment seeking a credible appearing but submissive figurehead.  Vidal sees Bush in the same tradition withone additional element, that of his steadfast embracing of the religious evangelical right to the point where he claims to gain information prior to decision making not from reading lengthy and tiresome briefing papers, but by talking to God.   <br /> <br />Gore Vidal advocates the very thing that the establishment fears, the convening of a constitutional convention.  He believes that this would be the perfect opportunity to bring important issues buried by the corporate media power structure to the fore in the interest of democracy, a people's representation far exceeding the timid exercises known as current political campaigns, which are so frequently replete with corruption in the form of vote additions and subtractions by individuals appropriately positioned in the power structure.	2004-11-30

With \\"Crossing The Rubicon\\" Ruppert has clearly established himself alongside the venerable essayist and political critic Gore Vidal as articulate voices decrying the rush to Empire and the tragic consequences of such  dictatorial actions. <br /> <br />Ruppert holds one other point in common with Gore Vidal as well as Noam Chomsky.  The mainstream media has attempted to render all three incisive critics of the established order as \\"non-persons.\\"  Thankfully Ruppert has survived the attempted destruction in the same manner as the other two authors, by speaking with such consistent and decisive logic and force that large segments of the public hungry for voices outside the realm of the corporate establishment media have read him and embraced his populist, anti-authoritarian viewpoint. <br /> <br />This well researched work contains many articles that first appeared on Ruppert's successful website.  It is called, appropriately, \\"From The Wilderness\\" in recognition of its independent message removed from the muddled mainstream of repetitious garble. <br /> <br />Many of the most informative articles appearing on the \\"From The Wilderness\\" site written by Ruppert and staff members have focused on \\"Peak Oil\\" and how control of that steadily depleting resource has influenced the American Empire headed ruthlessly by Dick Cheney.   <br /> <br />Ruppert constructs a time line concerning 9-11 and supplies details on the perpetrators to make the case that the Central Intelligence Agency operating in close concert with Cheney and fellow neoconservatives such as Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle used the tragedy as a means of invading Iraq while asserting previously unimagined domestic control under the guise of combating terrorism via the Patriot Act. <br /> <br />One fascinating point covered by Ruppert concerning his dissection of 9-11 and its consequences pertains to the unprecedented number of put options placed prior to the World Trade Center tragedy.  Not only was the volume unprecedented; so was the directional flow, all in favor of price reductions for United and American airlines, which stood to be negatively impacted by the calamity.  He connects the huge and rapid fire buying to the CIA in that Buzzy Krongard, who was an executive with one of the leading financial institutions investing in the put options, had been a major figure at the Langley, Virginia Agency. <br /> <br />Ruppert summarizes his information in his final chapter.  The former policeman adopts the stance of a deputy district attorney as he makes his case linking Cheney as the Empire's leading figure to orchestrating 9-11 and taking charge of the forward thrust to dominate the oil market during a period in which experts have issued dire warnings of a steadily depleting market.     <br /> <br />Another area into which Ruppert fearlessly treads, as he has frequently on his popular website, is the influence of illegal drugs on the U.S. and global economies.  He links this activity to the Central Intelligence Agency.  Early in the book he explains how making the discovery of the CIA drug link led to his departure from the Los Angeles Police Department and nearly cost him his life. <br /> <br />One of the most refreshing as well as rewarding elements of Ruppert's writing is that he strays away from the conventional and what is obtainable elsewhere while concentrating on providing the information that the powers that be, whether they be governmental or media, do not want you to read.	2004-11-29

Selznick	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Exploring Hollywood's Perfectionist	Veteran San Francisco-based film historian David Thomson does a fine job of putting into perspective the life of one of the most complicated giants of the Hollywood scene in \\"Showman\\", a restlessman whose quest for perfection led ultimately to obsession, the danger of perfectionists.  David O. Selznick grew up with the film industry in his blood and pursued the dominating passion to become the number one producer and culture influence during a period when the film industry ranked second only to that of automobile production. <br /> <br />Thomson traces Selznick's journey from his New York roots, when he would leave school and visit his father's office, dutifully studying film and making recommendations to his father, at the time one of America's giants in movie distribution.  He had no desire for book learning and spurned the idea of attending an Ivy League college in the manner of so many rich men's sons and quit school early, moving directly into the film business, where fame was awaiting. <br /> <br />When Selznick's father lost his fortune and career as a result of the movement toward major film studios in Hollywood, the determined son moved to Hollywood and went immediately to work.  His brother Myron did the same and became one of the industry's leading agents. <br /> <br />Gregory Peck, one of Selznick's most glittering discoveries, explained David O. Selznick's dilemma not long after his death in 1965.  Peck revealed how Selznick had told him once with a tone of sadness how he had achieved a career niche with the production of the classic \\"Gone With The Wind\\" when he was a young man.  As a result Selznick, who had achieved immortality with the great Civil War film classic before his fortieth birthday, felt the pressure of the classic film's giant shadow.  He strove mightily to achieve another gigantic success like it, but finally ruefully lamented that when he died \\"it will say in my obituary story that David O. Selznick was the producer of `Gone With The Wind.'\\" <br /> <br />There was much more to Selznick than \\"Gone With The Wind\\", however, and one of his cornerstone achievements was bringing Britain's great director Alfred Hitchcock to Hollywood under contract to Selznick International Films.  While the Hitchcock relationship involved clashes between two strong-willed titans, Selznick, a superb editor, was able to take script projects and scripts presented by Hitchcock apart, performing the role of a tough and uncompromising drill sergeant.  A classic example was their first project together, the 1940 classic \\"Rebecca.\\"  The film, which starred Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, secured for Selznick the second of two consecutive \\"Best Film\\" Oscars, coming one year after \\"Gone With The Wind.\\" <br /> <br />Selznick's quest for perfection led to a restlessness in which he took Benzedrine to stay awake and held conferences from late evening until dawn.  He also was an obsessive gambler and drank too much, not to mention being also a compulsive womanizer, which put a strain on his marriage to Irene Mayer Selznick, daughter of the powerful head of MGM. <br /> <br />Selznick's volcanic marriage came to an end following his affair with the protg to whom he became irrevocably linked in film annals, actress Jennifer Jones.  It was his quest to put her on filmdom's highest pedestal through providing her with a vehicle that he hoped would secure even more enduring success than \\"Gone With The Wind.\\" <br /> <br />The film was \\"Duel in the Sun\\" and it became immediately devoured with problems, beginning with spiraling budget costs and a Hollywood strike that plagued the production.  According to Thomson, Selznick's preoccupation with overseeing every aspect of \\"Duel in the Sun\\" and seeking ultimate perfection stemmed from what the author viewed as a coming of age sexually for Selznick with Jones, the woman he would marry and spend the rest of his life with after divorcing Irene.  He was particularly concerned with the steamy love scenes Jones performed with co-star Gregory Peck. <br /> <br />While \\"Duel in the Sun\\" would eventually become accepted as a scenic spectacle, though never garnering the tributes of \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" on its initial release it was widely panned by critics and was a box office flop.  It was a ponderous 26 hours long before Selznick began laboriously cutting and brought it down to a little over three hours in its initial release form. <br /> <br />After the problems encountered in \\"Duel in the Sun\\" Selznick went off to London, where he became embroiled in another gigantic flop, \\"The Paradine Case,\\" which ended his contractual and working relationship with Alfred Hitchcock.  He would have one more gigantic hit, but from afar, as the heralded \\"The Third Man\\" was produced and filmed in London and Vienna while Selznick peppered co-producer Sir Alexander Korda in London with endless memos from his Culver City office. <br /> <br />Thomson had a great deal to work with in the form of a fascinating achiever who led a colorful life and wrote some of the most memorable chapters of Hollywood history.  He made the most of his opportunity with \\"Showman\\".	2004-11-18
US	52389304	R3F04A1XV55YPF	0385503245	519479219	The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty	Books	5	54	70	N	N	A Thinning Bush Blood Line	While much has been written and said about the controversial scandal-oriented revelations on Kitty Kelley's book on the Bush dynasty, with charges and counter charges reverberating, most of the book is a story about the family and its political and business ties, and how it made its mark on history. <br /> <br />For those, like myself, who have read a great deal about Numbers 41 and 43 White House occupants George H. W. and George W. respectively, I learned the most from the earlier segments of the book dealing with Prescott and Dorothy Walker Bush.  It became easy to see why those who knew the family were inclined to mention a \\"thinning of the Bush blood line.\\"   <br /> <br />Prescott Bush was a handsome and dynamic man with excellent credentials as a student and an athlete at Yale.  His father in law secured for Prescott a position with the prestigious investment-banking firm of Brown Brothers-Harriman and, after securing a strong niche as a professional; he then pursued a career in public service.   <br /> <br />The Greenwich, Connecticut squire ran for the United States Senate from the Nutmeg State and was victorious.  He impressed President Dwight Eisenhower, a man he idolized in the manner of a father.  Eisenhower that enough of Bush to place him on a short list of individuals he believed would make good presidents. <br /> <br />Kelley compares and contrasts Prescott Bush and his son George on the subject of dealing with controversial political positions.  While Prescott Bush was an aristocrat and in certain revealed instances was disinclined to help working class types of more modest backgrounds when they sought assistance, he recognized the importance of civil rights legislation and sought to prod his party in a progressive direction in that key area. <br /> <br />In the case of son George's first race for the senate in Texas in 1964 against liberal Democratic Party incumbent Ralph Yarborough, he took a strong right turn along with a state party pushing hardin that direction.  This was the year that Barry Goldwater was nominated and ran against President Lyndon Johnson.  To enhance his chances in a conservative state Bush strongly adhered to the Goldwater line, opposing the recently passed Civil Rights Act shepherded to victory by Texan Johnson.   <br /> <br />This position irritated Prescott Bush, who viewed the contest with great interest from Connecticut.  Bush lost a closely contested race and was defeated against six years later when he ran against incumbent Lloyd Bentsen. <br /> <br />Prescott Bush displayed courage by running against the tide and rebuking Senator Joseph McCarthy, doing something that President Eisenhower, who loathed the Wisconsin demagogue, would not do, rebuke him publicly.  When his son George ran for reelection against Bill Clinton in the1992 presidential campaign, the Arkansas governor invoked the name of the then deceased Prescott Bush to counter neo-McCarthyite tactics of the Bush campaign regarding Clinton's anti-war activities while a Rhodes scholar living in England.   <br /> <br />The foul 1988 campaign won by Bush on wedge issues dominated by Willie Horton and a mandatory pledge of allegiance is also covered in detail.  Plainly Kelley believes that Prescott Bush would not have stooped to such tactics to secure an election victory. <br /> <br />There was a further thinning of blood in the case of the next George Bush.  Kelley emphasizes the psychological need for the young George Bush to behave in an outwardly macho manner to attract attention.  She notes how he ardently cursed, even after being \\"born again\\" as a Christian.  Kelley also writes about his penchant for swaggering and chewing tobacco, and his penchant for displaying himself as a Texas cowboy.   <br /> <br />Kelley writes in detail about the bitter 2000 South Carolina Republican presidential primary, revealing how an unprincipled Bush allowed his aides to engage in a scurrilous campaign against Senator John McCain of Arkansas.  Along with making a strong bid for the racist vote with an appearance at Bob Jones University, the Bush strategy of questioning McCain's sanity is covered in detail.  The desire for victory was so intense that seemingly nothing in the way of unsavory campaign accusation was ruled off limits. <br /> <br />The author concludes with a brief rundown on other dynasties, comparing and contrasting the Bushes with the Adamses, the only other American family in which a father and son served as president.  Kelley finds John and son John Quincy Adams superior in character, intellect, and ability to the two George Bushes.  She quotes Adams historian David McCullough as stating that John Quincy Adams was the most intelligent of all American presidents, then reveals that John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson biographer Robert Dallek referred to George W. Bush, Number 43, as \\"the stupidest president in American history.\\" <br /> <br />	2004-11-02

Books	5	147	160	N	N	Telling The Real Story About Thomas Jefferson	When I was first becoming politically active and living in Southern California, which was then an exciting if erratic \\"57 varieties\\" political stomping ground, I curiously visited the leading right wing bookstore in the area, located in Hollywood behind the insurance office of the man who ran it fervently with his wife.  I often wondered how he could make any money in the insurance office due to its neglect in favor of concentrating on the activist bookstore. <br /> <br />There was a sign that always remained, while others, often posters concerning political campaigns that came and went, was one that read: <br /> <br />\\"If Jefferson and Franklin were living today they would be regular customers of this bookstore.\\" <br /> <br />The right for years has sought to co-opt the Founding Fathers, particularly the great spokesman for liberty who penned America's Bill of Rights, Thomas Jefferson, as one of their own.  If a liberal dared to quote Jefferson, a right-winger would smirk and say, \\"Have you ever read Jefferson?  You liberals want big government.  Jefferson stood for limited government.  He wanted to extend individual liberty, not create a gigantic bureaucracy like you people do.\\"   <br /> <br />Thom Hartmann has done an adroit job of puncturing this right wing myth in his thoughtful and energetically researched work, \\"What Would Jefferson Have Done?\\"  The principle launching point that draws the distinction between what the right has long proclaimed and the reality of Jefferson's beliefs is the period and circumstances under which Jefferson and the Founding Fathers who synergized with him, towering giants such as Benjamin Franklin and James Madison, lived and functioned.   <br /> <br />It was Hartmann who authored the thoughtful work \\"Unequal Protection,\\" and this book segues snugly into the same ideological framework.  A major element of concern in the time of Jefferson and Franklin, which remains increasingly prevalent today, is the existence and robust operationof the corporation.  In \\"Unequal Protection\\" Hartmann traced the road traveled in the post-Civil War nineteenth century to eventually succeed in legally constructing an important governing principle of the corporation as a fictitious person, investing it thereby with gargantuan powers unforeseen by the citizenry at the time of America's creation. <br /> <br />Hartmann reveals that Jefferson sought to expand rights of the average citizen, putting him thereby in the liberal or progressive ideological camp rather than that of the doctrinaire rightists who for so long have insisted that he was one of them.  At the time of the country's beginnings Jefferson and other exponents of individual liberty were successful in fighting for limitations of time and scope on corporations, recognizing that they were, if unchecked, gigantic octopus-like instruments that would suffocate democracy. <br /> <br />Thom Hartmann fine-tunes his arguments by jumping back and forth between the America of Jefferson and the one emerging today.  It was Jefferson, he notes, who opposed Alexander Hamilton's efforts to create a highly expansive national bank, which he saw as a dangerous instrument of control.   <br /> <br />When he campaigned for the presidency the High Federalists who linked themselves to the early economic establishment fought Jefferson tenaciously, referring to him as \\"an atheist\\" and denouncing him for his suspected affair with his beautiful young slave Sally Hemings.  It has been ultimately revealed through DNA evidence that Jefferson had fathered children by Hemings.  Jefferson's bitter opponents sought to destroy him politically through his association with Hemings because they feared his steadfast opposition to their corporate designs. <br /> <br />When Hartmann moves the fight over corporate dominance and correlative diminution of the rights of average citizens he shows how the Alexander Hamiltons of yesteryear have become the Grover Norquists of today.  He demonstrates howthe fixation is the same, whether dealing with Hamilton's vision of a national bank or the so-called free trade agreements that high-powered lobbyists rush through Congress. <br /> <br />Hartmann's book provides readers with the best of both worlds.  He gives us a picture of the battles fought by Jefferson and his allies in early America and reveals how these same issues are being tenaciously fought over today.   <br /> <br />\\"What Would Jefferson Do?\\" reminds us once more of the validity of the old saying, \\"The more things change, the more they remain the same.\\"  Hartmann believes that with proper vigilance, Americans today can turn back the same challenges Jefferson fought to surmount in the nation's formative early period.	2004-10-28

It was Nichols who penned one of the most informative works on the 2000 post-presidential election pyrotechnics with \\"Jews For Buchanan.\\" <br /> <br />When George Bush the Elder was concerned about his son the Texas governor not possessing the knowledge and experience to tackle the presidency, while remaining bullish at the prospect of having him in the White House, his thoughts turned toward the veteran Dick Cheney, who had served the older Bush as his secretary of defense during the 1991 Gulf War.  Cheney had a long resume, which included becoming the youngest White House chief of staff in history at 34 under President Gerald Ford.  He had also served in the House of Representatives from Wyoming, where he achieved leadership in the conservative ranks and compiled an inflexibly right wing voting record.   <br /> <br />Cheney was devoid of charisma and his one effort to attract attention in a trial run for the presidency ended with a flat tire before the first primary of 1996.  Shortly afterwards, while fly-fishing off the coast of New Brunswick in Nova Scotia, Cheney met executives from the multi national Texas-based oil services provider, Halliburton Corporation.  They liked Cheney's government accessibility as a former secretary of defense and congressional leader and were then looking for a new chief executive officer.  Cheney and the executives agreed they could help each other and the political veteran signed on. <br /> <br />When the older George Bush came calling as the 2000 presidential election beckoned following the conclusion of two terms by Democrat Bill Clinton, it was to tap the Halliburton executive to lead a search committee to find the proper running mate to shore up the young George's deficiencies.  Cheney, an intrigue artist with well developed palace guard instincts, he had been second in command to the more flamboyant Donald Rumsfeld in Republican politics for too long.  This time he saw a way to vault above Rumsfeld and place himself in the White House catbird position. <br /> <br />One by one candidates were be screened.  Cheney remained on the scene always, and was able to supply the final word without a disparaging word from the Republican Party's presidential nominee.  Former Missouri Senator John Danforth, who had become a minister after leaving Washington, was thought by many to have the inside track to become vice presidential nominee, but meanwhile Dick Cheney was shrewdly operating behind the scenes. <br /> <br />There had been earlier grumblings, but when Danforth was also found wanting he joined the chorus, having believed that he, like those considered before him, had been manipulated for Cheney's personal gain.  With time running out Cheney proposed an idea to George W. Bush, who by then had become reliant on his judgment.  \\"Why not me?\\" Cheney suggested.   <br /> <br />Bush agreed, joking when he announced the selection that, with Cheney compelled to move back to Wyoming to become a voting resident there to avoid disrupting the constitutional restriction of a presidential nominee and his running mate both residents of the same state, \\"We didn't do it to win the 3 electoral votes of Wyoming.\\"   <br /> <br />The Karl Rove directed Bush propaganda machine, temporarily abandoned the \\"ah shucks, just plain folks\\" image showcasing Texas \\"cowboy\\" George Bush long enough to spin the word that would be bandied about through the rest of the campaign.  Cheney was selected because he had \\"gravitas,\\" a Latin word meaning seriousness or sobriety of thought.   <br /> <br />With Bush failing to know the names of important leaders while making numerous grammatical errors and malapropisms, humor had been used to paper over his deficiencies.  Republicans sought to convert negatives to positives by revealing the Texas governor as someone like your next door neighbor, imperfect, not knowing all the answers, but the type of person you would like to invite over for a beer. <br /> <br />An older, more experienced political hand was needed to keep a sometimes-rambunctious George W. Bush in tow and Dick Cheney, after running what Nichols and others concluded was a charade to seek a running mate for the Republican nominee, ultimately tapped himself.  An important distinction between the two Republican candidates surfaced in the fall debates with their Democratic opponents.  While Bush took a more restrained global political position against what he called \\"nation building,\\" when Cheney had his lone vice presidential debate against Connecticut's Senator Joseph Lieberman an important distinction arose between the two Republicans. <br /> <br />Oddly, Cheney's stated position in his debate with Lieberman found them in more harmony than was the case when contrasting what he said along with the Bush position as expounded in his appearances with Al Gore.  Cheney let it be known that he strongly believed in the U.S. assuming a role as warriors abroad rather than as peacekeepers.   <br /> <br />He repeated an argument he had made when secretary of defense under the elder Bush that it would be a mistake to cut the defense budget in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union.  He opposed the \\"peace dividend\\" then and in the way that he perceived that Bill Clinton had used it.  To Cheney it was a big mistake to transfer some budget priorities away from the Pentagon to the domestic sector.   <br /> <br />When asked by debate moderator Bernard Shaw about where Iraq fit into his equation, Cheney assumed a hawkish position that would be advanced from the time that he took his office in the White House.  As Nichols noted, those who watched the 2000 debates with an emphasis on what Bush was saying about restraint on the global scene were clearly paying attention to \\"the wrong end of the ticket.\\"   <br /> <br />As anti-terror intelligence specialist Richard Clarke and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill both wrote afterwards in insightful memoirs of the period after Bush took office, the focus from the beginning was on Iraq.  The emphasis never varied even after the 9-11 attacks, which, despite Cheney's false claims, had nothing to do with Saddam Hussein.      <br /> <br />In place of keeping the emphasis on Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda, Cheney sought to bring Iraq under the umbrella of international terrorism to generate a priority.  It was a priority that was shared by members of the energy task force that met in Cheney's office under his chairmanship.  Even a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch failed to pry information out of tight-lipped Dick and cohorts, but a few maps were located dividing up Iraq among the oil elite.   <br /> <br />We would ultimately learn that Cheney's old company Halliburton would receive a no bid contract to supply services in Iraq.  Another favorite Republican multi national, Bechtel, corporate stomping grounds for George Schultz and Casper Weinberger, also prospered from Cheney largesse. <br /> <br />It was Cheney and not Bush that orchestrated the rush to war in Iraq.  Cheney was the one who generated pressure among CIA analysts with appearances that were unprecedented from a vice president to the Langley headquarters.  With Cheney leading the drumbeat Iraq was invaded. <br /> <br />Nichols is a crack researcher.  After digging and revealing it becomes clear to any perceptive observer that Dick Cheney is the real power in the Bush White House.	2004-10-26

Bush in the Texas Air National Guard has been anything but exonerated. <br /> <br />Glenn Smith does a great service in exposing Bush as the same spoiled son of privilege who appears in the pages of Kitty Kelley's lengthy work on the Bushes.  Smith zeroes in on Bush's service and, to quote Gertrude Stein, discovers that \\"there is no there there.\\"  Standing in the forefront is Bush's father, a prominent Texas congressman, who knows the right people and is prepared to make the right moves to help his son avoid active duty in Southeast Asia. <br /> <br />The revelations of Smith demonstrate once more the double standard and rank hypocrisy running rampant on the Republican right.  The same people who turn and look the other way in silent embarrassment when Bush's National Guard service, and lack thereof, are mentioned are the same individuals who wanted to hang Bill Clinton from the nearest tree for being a \\"draft dodger\\" when he had a strong belief that the Vietnam War was wrong.   <br /> <br />In the case of Bush he was a staunch anti-Communist who saluted Barry Goldwater's position of an aggressive bombing campaign against the North Vietnamese.  Despite Bush's strong professed beliefs that the Vietnam War was the right move and that the Communists needed to be stopped, he headed for the tall grass when the opportunity to put his actions behind his stated convictions arose. <br /> <br />At least there is some consistency in the Bush position.  He did, after all, choose Dick Cheney as his vice president.  Tough cold warrior Cheney also has solid credentials as a Chicken Hawk, having expressed himself strongly on behalf of the Vietnam War, then aggressively pursued four educational deferments.  After the last deferment expired the man they would later call Mr. Gravitas did the only noble thing under the circumstances, he impregnated his wife, receiving a final deferment and saying goodbye for good to his Vietnam problems.   <br /> <br />Bush had, after all, been a cheerleader at Andover Academy.  Bush and Cheney proved to be effective Chicken Hawk cheerleaders as the sons of East Los Angeles and Watts were called on to serve on active duty in Vietnam.	2004-10-14

Bush's America	Books	5	16	23	N	N	Plain Talking Populism	Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose have developed a good old down home ring for their populist message.  They put the current economic situation in America in the perspective of the average American and what the Bush policies have meant to such individuals in that category. <br /> <br />The authors refer to their method as the Doug Jones Average, with Doug representing the average Joe.  This book is replete with stories about Americans treading water.  Some are not even treading, and have lost their jobs while others find themselves working longer hours and taking home less pay. <br /> <br />The Ivins and Dubose formula for action begins at the ballot box.  They take a hard look at Bush economic policies and conclude that they are disproportionately weighted to the advantage of the wealthy, particularly in the corporate sector.  As Ivins said recently after Bill O'Reilly called her a socialist and eventually apologized, what she favors is a regulated form of capitalism such as was practiced in progressive Democratic presidential administrations under chief executives such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.   <br /> <br />If we would return to those successful policies of yesteryear Ivins and Dubose are confident that things would begin looking up on the Doug Jones Index.	2004-10-08

Frank, a leading psychiatrist and a professor at George Washington University, sees George W. Bush as a ticking time bomb.  Considering his important position and potential for danger both in America and abroad, Frank sees it as imperative to replace Bush before it is too late.  The final passage of the epilogue in his informative work, Bush on the Couch:  Inside the Mind of the President, sends a blunt warning to the American people: <br /> <br />\\"Our sole treatment option - for his benefit and for ours - is to remove President Bush from office.  It is up to all of us - Congress, the media, and voters - to do so, before it is too late.\\" <br /> <br />Frank points out that the position of power Bush occupies, while on the surface protecting him from the dangers of a grim reality he fears to confront, is nonetheless a false fortress he has erected to free himself from inner demons long tormenting him.  He believes that it is just a question of time before the failures of Bush's past collide with the present with disaster the consequence. <br /> <br />As the psychiatrist observes, this is by no means the first exploration into the mind of a president.  The intelligent establishment uses psychiatrists to analyze foreign leaders, particularly those with nuclear potential and dictatorial propensities.  Frank reveals that we entered the field of such analysis with the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the current CIA, analyzing Adolf Hitler.  When Lyndon Johnson began losing control and acting erratically during the midst of his Vietnam War pressures, young aides Bill Moyers and Richard Goodwin independently contacted psychiatrists and reported their findings to select political insiders.  It was revealed by BBC investigator and author Anthony Summers that Richard Nixon had consulted one of the world's leading psychiatrists beginning shortly after his assumption of the vice presidency to the final period of his life after he resigned the presidency in disgrace. <br /> <br />The Bush tragedy, as so frequently occurs with truly troubled individuals, began in early boyhood according to Dr. Frank.  His Oedipus complex difficulties stemmed from the death of his younger sister Robin and the aftermath of his mother, previously his bedrock of strength, retreating from her past sturdy commitment into a pallor of gloom.  The former Barbara Pierce's depression over the tragic loss of her young daughter Robin was compounded by an inferiority complex stemming from her youth.  Barbara had felt inadequate compared to her beautiful mother, who acted with natural social grace and charmed virtually everyone within her scope of contact.  Barbara as a result developed an inner toughness, a stern outer and inner veneer to cope and make her own way. <br /> <br />At the very time when Barbara Bush was choked with grief over Robin's death, impressionable young George was unable to receive meaningful parental attention from his father, either.  George H. W. Bush was making his way in the oil business and politics.  His journeys took him away from home for significant periods of time, leaving young George to cope on his own. <br /> <br />In Frank's estimation this was the period in which Bush's problems accentuated as he created his own world, forming a shell of protective fantasy.  His rebellion frequently took on airs of cruelty, as evidenced by recently revealed accounts that as a youngster he blew up frogs with firecrackers.  Later, as a student at Yale, he became involved in dishing out cruel and sadistic initiation rites, using coat hangers in the manner of cattle prods and dismissing his actions as no more harmful than burning cigarettes on flesh. <br /> <br />During his periods at Andover Prep and Yale University as an undergraduate Bush sought to live up to the image of his father before him, the elusive man he could not seemingly get to know in his formative earlier years.  The fact that the elder Bush succeeded as a student well beyond his oldest son and was captain of the varsity baseball team, while George the younger failed to make the team, further exacerbated the problems reeling within him.  Later he would follow his father into the oil business and fail and become managing partner of the Texas Rangers American League baseball team.  Alas, he would later also enter the world of politics as well. <br /> <br />The conflicted young George W. took heavily to drink and did not step away from alcohol until passing out of his thirties.  While on the surface his conversion to born again Christianity with the assistance of family friend, the Reverend Billy Graham, might have looked like the emergence of a stable Bush, Frank sees the opposite.  Obsessive behavior drove Bush to alcoholism while Christianity was embraced in the same manner, with a level of fanaticism.  Frank sees exercise in the same manner.  Whereas on the surface Bush's efforts, as explained by him, are designed to keep him physically fit, analysis reveals an obsession at work.  Reporters who observed him on running tracks were astounded at the ferocity into which he threw himself.  His efforts ultimately led to him injuring a knee seriously enough to end that activity.  More recently, in his new pursuit of uphill bike riding, he has fallen twice, sustaining only minor injuries.  While he insists that such efforts are necessary to remain in peak physical condition, Frank sees obsession as the reason for such ferocious expenditures of energy, conceding that Bush might well believe that his own reasoning is correct. <br /> <br />Reporters and other Bush watchers have noticed that he reveals two separate demeanors.  There is the cocky, swaggering Bush, a real life version of Larry Hagman as J.R. in the old Dallas series, an executive in control.  Another image is displayed when he assumes an expression of fear, what is termed Bush's \\"deer in the headlights\\" demeanor.  Frank sees both images as stemming from the same source, fear.  He uses the swagger to convince Americans that he is on top of all situations while, reeling inwardly, are the doubts and insecurities manifesting themselves in the fearful image that his countrymen have also observed. <br /> <br />The inner torment is what, in Frank's view, drives Bush to the point of seeing things in black and white.  In the midst of conflict with Iraq Bush proclaimed that we as Americans were hated because we were strong and beacons of freedom, and that other countries were jealous of us.  The war represented a case of \\"us against them\\" and other nations were aligned either for or against us.  There was no room for neutrality or any other position between those two clearly defined positions. <br /> <br />Frank relates that the tragedy of Bush being in such a position or awesome power is that he is using the presidency to attempt to find a way around his own deeply rooted insecurities.  Megalomania and paranoia are results of longstanding patterns of escape borne of frightful insecurity.  While Franks acknowledges that we have all known people like this in our lifetimes, the tragedy in Bush's case is that he is commander in chief of the free world and is in a position to inflict great harm here and abroad in his delusional frame of mind.  Bush needs to constantly reinforce the idea that he is right.  To admit wrongdoing is contrary to his conflicted inner nature, as revealed by his persistent untruths and unwillingness to back down, as evidenced by his insistence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.   <br /> <br />The psychiatrist also answers the question of how Bush has been able to command such a strong national following despite his inadequacies, such tremendous uncertainties and frustrations amid inability to effectively communicate on many occasions.  The psychiatrist concludes that these individuals empathize with Bush because they see in him certain elements of themselves.  The frustrated, tongue-tied, inarticulate Bush is seen as possessing the same human frailties these humans also possess.  The imperious, tough talking Bush appeals to their inner frustrations and makes them feel good.  He is someone articulating his frustrations on behalf of America, expressing the view of the Peter Finch disturbed television commentator figure of the epic film Network, who shouted the stirring mantra, \\"We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore!\\"	2004-08-10

Dionne is a mild-mannered, highly erudite Oxford graduate who pens reflective and intelligent political opinion pieces for the Washington Post.  This book is a wakeup call to liberal-progressives that the battle so long thought lost by so many is far from that; the seeds for victory are at hand as long as the case is correctly made. <br /> <br />Dionne tackles the proposition that, because of a well-financed Republican spin machine, which has sought to demonize the word \\"liberal\\" and put forward the proposition that those who follow the philosophy's principles are misguided or worse, too many progressives have backed away from the fight and often taken apologetic positions.  Dionne believes that any posture of defensiveness should be abandoned for an aggressive campaign.  Dionne points out that, while moral fiber and patriotism are trotted out as staple Republican core values, the record tells a different story in instances where tax cuts are sought to please a wealthy coterie of party supporters and traditional beliefs about war and peace are turned upside down by neoconservatives who all too frequently seek to attack first and ask questions later.   <br /> <br />A reporter who took the Howard Dean movement seriously from the beginning and was on the scene during key periods of the Vermont populist's presidential campaign, Dionne quickly noted that the fresh new face on the block was attracting a large support base by tackling the issues and asserting hard-core progressive positions on taxation, health care, and the environment.  While Dean might not have won even one primary, Dionne was perceptive enough to notice that other more successful Democratic candidates, including John Kerry, began adopting a position of \\"We're fed up and we're not gonna take it anymore\\" rather than the more vanilla brand of \\"play it safe\\" politics earlier prevailing.  By being afraid to tackle the bloated Republican special interest culture the twin dangers of 1) losing voters to the sidelines through apathy, or 2) losing them to Ralph Nader and Green Party candidates based on conviction are more likely to be realized.  A solid agenda needs to be projected to counter an increasingly sharpening rightist Republican tilt.  As Dionne notes, when this happens people become engaged, as was the case with the Dean movement. <br /> <br />Dionne believes, as does conservative political author Kevin Phillips, that the Republicans have abandoned the vital center.  While they attempt to attack Democrats as being out of step with mainstream American voters, Dionne believes that the opposite is true, that the Democrats have the vital American center in reachable co-opting distance, and what is needed is the resolute tenacity and clarity of message to take control of mainstream America at the polls.  Dionne argues that it is time to stop being timid and come forward with alternative proposals to a current Republican philosophy of hard core rightist rigidity that is a far cry from the conservatism of Senator Robert Taft and the centrist Republicanism of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.	2004-07-30

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	5	23	28	N	N	A Prairie Populist Appraises the Land of his Roots	Tom Frank was born and bred in America's heartland, growing up in the prairie state of Kansas.  He ventured off to Chicago in pursuit of an education in political science and secured a doctorate from the University of Chicago, one of the land's leading academic institutions.<br />Something puzzled Frank greatly about the state where he grew up and the prairie land of his roots in general, and once he had the knowledge under his belt from all that hard work securing his doctorate in Chicago he returned home in an attempt to resolve the doubt in his mind.  What puzzled the bright young guy from America's prairie land was the rigidly inflexible voting pattern of support for Republican conservatives.  <br />The reason for Frank's puzzlement was that this was an area where the economy had gone into the tank, where farmers were losing their properties as swiftly and frequently as the wind blew, and scarcely anybody else appeared to be doing much if any better.  Frank discovered the reason was that the Republicans had taken control of the social issues, which assumed preeminence in the minds of the voters as opposed to bread and butter economic issues.  The irony, according to Frank, is that the issues successfully backed by cultural conservatives to sway prairie voters do not figure to ever secure adoption.  Frank does not expect prayer in the schools to become a reality.  He feels the same about former Alabama Justice Moore's effort to place a Christian religious statue on the public property of the state capitol.  In Franks's view, it is the effort that counts with voters, just as long as the cultural conservatives properly showcase their efforts, making it appear they are giving their all on behalf of their causes.<br />Another irony cited by Frank is that on one issue where Democrats could possibly have established potentially successful separation from Republicans was in the area of international trade, one that is a sore point what with many Kansans losing jobs as aresult of such trade policies.  Instead, he ruefully notes, the Clinton administration took a pro-NAFTA stance, losing a golden opportunity to make headway in Republican prairie states.<br />Frank states that the sole area of his current political focus is with economic issues.  He urges progressive Democrats to tailor them more to the home spun folks of the nation's heartland, as well as to make a case pointing out the importance of bread and butter issues as opposed to focusing on cultural matters that will never be implemented into law.	2004-07-17

His politics are liberal and he tells you so, but that does not mean that he lays all the blame in his reflective and highly critical analysis of the current political system on the political right.  He believes that there is more than enough blame to go around on all sides.<br />If anyone thought that Germond might spare the profession through which he made a handsome living from the criticism he levels at the system, the reader is promptly disabused of such a notion.  Germond indicts his own profession harshly.  Sure, he is aware and makes note of the importance of making a buck, selling advertising, and dramatizing stories.  He laments the talking head trend and oversimplification in place of analysis, but does not indict commercialism as the sole beast.  Germond believes that all too often reporters take the easy and lazy way out.  Create an interesting story, spin it until it wears out, and save oneself a lot of thinking, not to mention shoe leather.<br />As for the politicians, he reveals that the positions they take all too often involve pandering to a ready made base, a \\"don't rock the boat\\" attitude, rather than any solid belief in those core positions, which are stated emphatically, in the manner of a true believer, but to achieve effect rather than as a manifestation of conscience and analytical reflection.  A candid comment from Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina is employed to move into an important domain of criticism.  When Germond asked him point blank if he was considering running for president, Hollings replied, \\"Jack, senators think about running for president all the time.\\"<br />Hollings's frankness caused Germond to reflect on the matter.  His conclusion is that at all levels of government, from city council to governors and U.S. senators, a stepping stone mentality remains steadfast.  A popular councilman, rather than focusing intently on the district, is thinking about a next move up the ladder to Congress.  Once elected to Congress, thoughts begin turning toward the senate.  Alas, once in the senate thoughts turn toward the White House.  Germond sees the \\"reach for the ring\\" distraction as redounding against the needs and interests of constituents who put the officeholders in office in the first place.<br />Sloppy reporting, oversimplification, and dramatization in place of issue analysis have proved costly.  The laziness of reporters along with the desire to spin a drama rather than provide the tools for reader and viewer education has resulted in a general dumbing down of the entire political process.  Germond is informing us that we had better not hold our breath and expect any positive changes anytime soon.<br />Hopefully Germond will be proven unduly pessimistic.  He hopes so as much as we do.  He tells us not to count on it, though, and sees himself and the rest of us walking through the Forest Gump thickets in a haze rather than focusing intelligently on our problems.   <br />The best lesson to take from this book is to consider it a constructive slap on the face.  Once slapped take an active interest in what is going on from the local level all the way to the presidency.  If enough informed people demanded enough answers Jack Germond would be the first one to beam a happy smile.	2004-07-11

Kevin Phillips, for one, has stated that the reason why most elections involving presidential incumbents are decided by 10-point margins or better is that voters are essentially voting a chief executive up or down on their perception of performance.  A positive rating will hence result in an impressive victory margin while negative evaluations eventuate in solid defeats.  While Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan are both renowned as popular vote getters, it must be remembered that the former benefited from Depression circumstances in trouncing Herbert Hoover while the latter profited from an existing oil embargo, energy shortage, and hostage crisis to post an impressive triumph over Jimmy Carter.<br />Having concluded that the election is more of a checklist evaluating George Bush on the major issues confronting him in four years of office, rather than a basic comparison involving Bush and rival John Kerry, Press cites the reasons why he believes the incumbent should be rejected.  He cites the rush to war as one major factor, pointing out that the reasons Bush provided for going to war, imminent danger due to Saddam Hussein possessing weapons of mass destruction and a putative link between the Iraqi dictator and Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, were never proven.  Press notes that it will take a long time for the United States to repair its damaged international image and posture vis-à-vis its allies as a result of Bush's rush to war.<br />Press gives Bush a failing grade for his stewardship over the U.S. economy.  He notes that the Bush tax cuts stacked overwhelmingly in the favor of wealthy Americans have resulted in tremendous budget shortfalls.  Press contrasts the Clinton baton handoff to his successor in which the country had a healthy surplus and now, lamenting its squandering by Bush and resulting oppressive debt that puts the nation in a precarious economic position.<br />Another area where Press sharply criticizes Bush is in the appointment of John Ashcroft, former right wing Missouri senator, as attorney general.  Press labels Ashcroft as an extremist who, in the name of fighting terror, succeeded in securing congressional passage of the Patriot Act, which sharply curtails valuable constitutional liberties.  He believes that Bush and his advisers, based on Ashcroft's track record, should have rejected him out of hand as a possibility for the role of America's leading law enforcement official.	2004-07-10

Many years before that he met Clinton on a boat to England, where they were both going to study as Rhodes Scholars.  Reich was a major campaigner on the Clinton team when he was elected in 1992 over President George H.W. Bush.<br />In this cogent work Reich makes the case for why liberals will achieve expanding  influence while that of the Republican right will diminish.  The reason is that, in Reich's view, they have abandoned traditional conservatism and are embracing instead a radical style of politics that is out of step with mainstream America.  As a result he has coined a new term for this type of what Reich believes to be a counterfeit conservative.  His label is radcon, an amalgam for radical conservative politics.<br />Reich notes that, whereas traditional conservatism under Edmund Burke called for cautious reflection and a strong emphasis on traditionalism, the Bush-styled conservative movement is just the opposite.  Whereas Burke and his conservative disciples embraced a doctrine of collegiality and sought compromise without sacrificing their traditionalistic principles, the Bush administration has embraced a pattern of radical spending in calling for tax cuts while the country was in the throes of deficits and an aggressive foreign policy.<br />Foreign affairs is an area Reich hones into to distinguish between the Bush brand of radical conservatism with that of traditional Republican conservative thought in America.  At one point towering Republican figures such as Senator Robert Taft of Ohio embraced isolationism.  Now under the neocons in his administration the Bush team has embraced a concept they call pre-emptive war but is actually preventive war, reserving the right to attack nations before making a case of necessity through self-defense.<br />Robert Reich also differentiates between the old conservative doctrine of preserving privacy, which libertarians assiduously believe, and have substituted a policy of invasion of individual rights and liberties, as manifested in the broad powers of the Patriot Act.  He argues that whereas the radical right is so concerned about what happens to a fetus, such concern vanishes regarding the citizenry in general, and particularly in those instances where individuals are discriminated against because of sexual preference.<br />Despite the fact that Reich as a liberal would like to see his viewpoint attain greater prominence on the American spectrum, he is clearly sad about what the radicalization of the Republican Party has done to the two party system.  At one time collegiality and cooperation ruled, despite philosophical differences.  Now Bush tax advocate supporter Grover Norquist scoffs at such bipartisanship, referring to it as \\"date rape.\\"	2004-06-24

It was a broad manifestation of hope that energized him on an incredible highway of success resulting in two terms as president and a higher approval rating on his departure from office than even the popular Ronald Reagan.  This book traces this journey in simple, straightforward prose, in the manner of a storyteller, which William Jefferson Clinton definitely is.  The \\"good old boy\\" homespun Arkansan manner comes across vividly as one spirits through the pages of this moving as well as definitive memoir.<br />Clinton moves quickly into the personal side of his life at the book's outset.  He reveals about how his father died tragically in an automobile accident before he was born.  He then recounts how, when he was pursuing the presidency, people who had encountered his father revealed information about him to his son.  It took until his run for the presidency to become aware of fascinating facets about the man he never saw.  He also recounts in vivid detail the marriage of his mother to the man who would become his father and, as a result of which he would change his name from Blythe to Clinton.  The future president grew up in a household in which his mother was repeatedly beaten and verbally abused by a man who, under other circumstances, would, according to Clinton, have been thoroughly decent.  Clinton recounts how inability to cope with the demon of alcohol resulted in tragedy for the entire family.<br />Syndicated columnist David Broder once referred to Clinton as possessing \\"an off the charts IQ\\" and his meteoric rise from a youngster growing up poor in a small rural Arkansas town to scholarships at the finest universities in the world corroborate that conclusion.  An honor student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where Clinton got his first whiff of politics as an intern in the office of political legend Senator William Fulbright from Clinton's native state of Arkansas, he then moved on to prestigious Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar.  Following that period it was on to Yale University as a law student.  That was where he met the woman he would marry, Hillary Rodham.  Clinton concedes that, without Hillary Rodham Clinton operating at his side, he never would have achieved the presidency.<br />This fascinating memoir balances the ledger between personal details shaping the author's life experience and the important political contribution he played in the event-filled final quarter of the twentieth century.  Clinton modestly concedes that being elected governor of his home state in 1978 at 32 had its downside, stemming from what he perceives as an immaturity to see political life with the kind of breadth that would only result from additional life experience.  He learned from his mistakes and, after he was elected again in 1982 he never looked back thereafter, winning succeeding governor's races until throwing his hat into the ring for the presidency in 1992.  It was a bold stroke for a governor from a small state to enter the fray at that time, during a period when incumbent George Herbert Walker Bush had scaled a heady 91 percent approval rating in the wake of America's victory over Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.<br />Details from Clinton's personal life threatened to do in his candidacy as he fought tenaciously in the New Hampshire primary to stay in the fray and fight longer for the grand prize he would ultimately achieve.  As Republican adversaries would later acknowledge, \\"Bill Clinton is a guy who can take a punch.\\"  Clinton tenaciously fought his way through negative media coverage about his personal life to initially achieve the Democratic nomination, then the presidency itself.  His triumph over travail resulted in him earning the nickname \\"the comeback kid\\".<br />Clinton discusses his worst moment in the White House, when he was compelled to tell Hillary about the affair he had engaged in with Monica Lewinsky prior to testifying before Kenneth Starr's grand jury.  He acknowledges that he took advantage of a situation simply because it was there and should have resisted temptation.  He states that Kenneth Starr was part of a Clinton-hating strategy unfurled by the Republican right to destroy him.  Clinton notes that Whitewater allegations bore no fruit, that it was a transaction wherein he and Hillary had lost money, and that his political enemies were eager to latch onto the Lewinsky scandal as a means of removing him from office.  He considers his resistance to impeachment and ultimate victory as constituting a \\"badge of honor.\\"<br />Bill Clinton continues to impress many while his detractors retain their sharp-edged opposition to all for which he stood.  The most recent CNN poll reveals that 62 percent of his fellows Americans view Bill Clinton and his presidency favorably, impressive support coming some four years after his departure from office.  As a skilled politician he stood in the ranks of FDR and John F. Kennedy.  Here was a man under whose watch 22 million new jobs were created.  Clinton turned around a $4 trillion national debt and left office in the midst of a healthy surplus.  He resisted ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and helped broker what many deemed an impossible to achieve peace pact between Israelis and Arabs.  Clinton also brought minorities more into the nation's mainstream through numerous federal appointments, many of which were in the judiciary. <br />Clinton's is a Horatio Alger story of a rise from poverty to the world's most powerful person.  It is interesting to experience that journey through his eyes.  After finishing this extraordinary voyage with him the reader is left with one conclusion - that we will be seeing much more from Bill Clinton as this extraordinary journey continues.	2004-06-22

Bush	Books	5	54	73	N	N	A Comparative Study	John Dean was thrust into the limelight in his early thirties when, as a youthful White House counsel, he was part of the Richard Nixon White House that came undone through the Watergate scandal and its attendant circumstances.  Dean's riveting testimony in the Watergate hearings helped bring down the Nixon government.  He served a brief sentence in a federal penitentiary for being involved in its machinations.<br />Dean has seen scandal firsthand and government abuse in a presidential administration.  In addition to having a legal background, he also had a career as an investment banker.  These perspectives give him a unique insider's opportunity to compare the Nixon White House to that of George W. Bush.  His title \\"Worse Than Watergate\\" reveals which administration he finds more culpable of violating public trust.<br />While Dean openly concedes that Nixon and his cronies sought to use the American people, he contends that the basic difference between that administration and Bush's is that the earlier president did not seek to treat the American people \\"like suckers,\\" indicating that this is what the Bush White House has been doing.  He contends that there is no way that the Bush administration actually believed its claims against Iraq of the possession of weapons of mass destruction and being on the brink of nuclear weaponry.  Dean cites the Bush White House of violating the public trust by taking the country to war on false and trumped up rationale.<br />He notes that, while the Nixon White House was known for its secrecy, that of the Bush administration is much more terrifying.  He even describes the bunker where Dick Cheney goes, revealing a scenario comparable to George Orwell's 1984.  Dean blames the Bush White House for using the terrorist attacks of 9-11 to justify undermining American democracy.  Like so many critics of this administration, Dean is apprehensive over the conduct of the Justice Department under Attorney General John Ashcroft, with particular concern over the Patriot Act and the power it gives to law enforcement while abrogating the liberties of Americans.<br />Dean write in a facile, easily comprehensible style, always keeping the reader engaged.  His level of experience and knowledge come through at every turn, making this a fascinating reading experience.  In the final analysis it is much more than that, though, as Dean cautions Americans about how precious the gift of liberty is and how it can be lost in the pursuit of an administration seeking to convert the war on terror to partisan political advantage.	2004-06-18

His two enduring plays were \\"Night Must Fall\\" and \\"The Corn Is Green.\\"  A man who spent his writing life in the fictional realm provided himself a challenge and turned his prodigious talents to true crime.  The result is a merger of true crime with the poetry of a true creative artist in \\"Beyond Belief.\\"<br />Ian Brady grew up living with guardians in a lower middle class section of Glasgow.  When his mother, who bore him out of wedlock, marries, he goes to live with her for the first time.  His move to the English Midlands finds him leading a solitary life in which he lives for the cinema.  Williams shows us how a dangerous pattern is established early on when he yens for films of violence, identifies closely with the villain Harry Lime played brilliantly by Orson Welles in \\"The Third Man,\\" and abhors love story-musicals such as those with Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald, which he ridicules.<br />When he is working in a factory as a stock clerk in Gorton, a suburb of Manchester, he meets Myra Hindley for the first time.  In many ways the large, voluptuous woman is more masculine than Brady.  Williams brilliantly delineates a perceived identity crisis that he believes could have turned them both in the wrong direction.  <br />William does an excellent job of showing us the lower middle class despair of young people growing up in sixties' England.  He uses the dialect of the young, uneducated working class to evoke the kind of atmosphere associated with the best of novel writing.  The cast of characters rings true throughout.  <br />Eventually the couple turns to crime in a big way.  Brady abducts children and perpetrates murders while Myra, who appears hypnotized by Ian, terminates her assertiveness in his case and becomes his subservient accomplice.<br />The author makes his sociological points without ever being preachy.  His page-turning style is riveting as readers learn little by little about these two young people whose lives become living hells for themselves and those they encounter.	2004-06-06

This is by far the most controversial entry given the subject matter and level of current debate.<br />Anthony Zinni hailed from Philadelphia and chose the Army as his career.  Clancy covers his fascinating and highly successful career including his stint in Vietnam as well as various other outposts up until the time of his crowning Army pinnacle, commander of Central Command, the same post occupied by Norman Schwarzkopf and Tommy Franks.<br />Zinni's experiences at Cent Com provide the basis for the hot discussion of the book, not to mention its swift rise to the highest echelons of bestseller charts.  The General's prominence along with his message regarding the rush to war in Iraq enabled him to jump start the book's celebrity status with an appearance on Sixty Minutes on CBS.  <br />The outspoken Zinni writes that he suspected trouble at the outset where Iraqi policy was concerned.  His book comments dovetail with press accounts, which had him warning his government about the dangers involved in a swift approach to combat.  He lays the blame on the Defense Department, arguing that America was left unprepared for the task involved and the turbulence that resulted after the first phase of the war ended, at a time when victory was declared. <br />Zinni's outspoken comments are reminiscent of those of two prominent battlefield commanders at the time the Vietnam War was escalating.  Generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway were heroes of World War Two and the Korean War respectively.  They warned about the dangers of a prolonged conflict in Vietnam.  They did not believe that conditions were conducive to the kind of decisive victory being foreseen at the Pentagon.  Regrettably their warnings were not heeded.  <br />Zinni has a better chance of getting through with his message, given the fact that the public response to attendant continuing difficulties has been much quicker than in the case of Vietnam.  Also, many prominent figures from the military, the government, and the media have echoed sentiments Zinni expresses in the book.  <br />General Zinni is a great patriot who loves his country.  His critical warnings are meant to enhance America's best interests.  He deserves an attentive audience.	2004-06-06

Ironically, he had been given a hero's reception by the father of George W. Bush for his service in Iraq prior to the start of the 1991 Gulf War.  What a difference a decade and circumstances surrounding another Bush can make.<br />Wilson writes fascinatingly about his career in the Foreign Service, about accompanying Bill Clinton to Africa, along with what had been his most notable experience prior to recently, his experiences with Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein prior to the start of the 1991 Gulf War.  Wilson was the last American to talk to the dictator prior to the onset of the conflict.<br />After filling in readers on the interesting earlier experiences of his Foreign Service career he then deals with the tragic controversy that has made him a household name.  Wilson determined following investigation that the report that Saddam Hussein was seeking yellow cake from which to extract uranium in the interest of building nuclear weapons, with which he would ostensibly attack America, was totally false.  <br />The next step in the scenario found Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, a secret CIA operative  in the area of weapons of mass destruction, outed in an article by right wing columnist Robert Novak.  Not only did the disclosure blow her cover, it left her exposed to possible assassination, an event that has occurred in certain cases involving other secret U.S. agents.<br />Wilson delivers his theories of the despicable outing.  He had earlier implicated Bush strategy guru Karl Rove.  Wilson's new explanation after additional analysis is that Rove ordered what is termed a \\"workup\\" or overall analysis of Wilson.  From there he writes about what happened, implicating a noted White House operative working for an even better known administration.  The reader can pursue with interest from this point.<br />The Bush administration delivered an unimaginative rebuttal when informed about Wilson's charges.  Bush administration presssecretary Scott McClellan explained that Wilson was a partisan who is supporting Bush's opponent, Senator John Kerry, which brings his credibility into jeopardy.  Imagine that!  Tell us, Scott.  If your wife had suffered the same fate, would you be supporting the lead figure of the administration responsible?	2004-05-29

Bush	Books	5	36	41	N	N	Confronting Constitutional Questions	John Bonifaz was part of the legal process in seeking to impeach Bush, confronting critical constitutional issues in that process.  In failing to meet the criteria established by  elements of the international community, Bush bypass UN approval in his haste for war.  <br />Bush stated the importance of going to war as what he and advisers termed a preemptive action, a necessity in the face of a clear and present danger from an aggressive enemy.  In choosing to act on his own rather than allowing the UN weapons inspection team finish its work, and relying on a false claim that Iraq's Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, Bush threw open the distinct possibility of an impeachment action.<br />The U.S. is obligated to follow laws and processes to which it has committed itself, namely the UN Charter and the Geneva Accords, and to fail to do so means more than a violation of international law.  Such an act is violative of the U.S. Constitution since a president is mandated to follow the laws to which the nation is committed.  Bonifaz and fellow petitioners contend that this failure leaves Bush open to removal from office.<br />Richard Nixon resigned from office after being impeached and facing a Senate trial for removal.  He was previously found guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors by the House of Representatives.  A good case can be made that Bush, by rushing to war and not allowing inspections to be completed, violated the law and distorted the facts by insisting that that which had not been proven, namely that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, compelled him to go to war in the interest of American safety.<br />The more the issue has been studied the more compelling the evidence has become that Iraq under Saddam Hussein was only a shell of the military threat it formerly posed.  Did Bush and his close advisers not know this?  If so, by what rationale could it commit American troops to war?	2004-05-25

The eruption of displeasure in the form of reviews downgrading his book without any refuting comments is evidence of the feathers he has ruffled.<br />Brock existed in an ozone of hatred working for Reverend Moon's Washington Times and Richard Mellon Scaife's The American Spectator, and was part of the evidence manufacturing campaign to discredit and hopefully impeach Bill Clinton.  He eventually felt ashamed of what he had become and courageously turned his back on the right wing hate machine.<br />After turning his back on rightist hate Brock took one more courageous step forward, using his writing skills and knowledge of a vicious movement to expose it in print.  &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot; was his first effort.  Now that the hate is out there for all to see thanks to Brock's first effort at exposing rightist hypocrisy, revealing that they are not the compassionate religionists they claim to be, his next step is to reveal how the hate machine operates.<br />Brock's revelations prove eloquently the statement made by Hillary Clinton that was ridiculed at the time, that a well nurtured, highly organized right wing conspiracy exists.  It begins with the mega dollars of Scaife and Moon, who finance not only partisan right wing journals, but orchestrate propaganda proclaiming that the major media are leftist-dominated.  Bill O'Reilly has stated with a straight face that Faux News is objective, and that what appears as right wing to leftist zealots is really only balanced coverage.  Anyone who believes that might as well believe that Sean Hannity is a socialist.<br />Through dollar might and skilled repetition, the right has been able to take lies manufactured from the Drudge Report and send them to the most watched and read media channels.  All this is done in the interest of letting the news be read and heard, all under the disguise of objectivity and fair commentary.<br />Brock takes you beyond the facade and provides the raw facts.  He knows these people, is willing to tell what he knows, and the right cringes.  The right's only response is to huff and puff, stating that he is producing trash.  He has too much ammunition for them.  To know them is to expose them.  Having been exposed, they are revealed, in the manner of Bush and fellow emperor Cheney, as wearing no clothes.	2004-05-22

Griffin confronts the evidence and questions whether it is more likely that seemingly inexplicable events resulted from pure happenstance, mistake or design.  His efforts leave us, as well as himself, concerned that what occurred on that fateful day that changed America occurred through at least some measure of design, and at the highest levels.<br />Griffin's intelligent exploration of the facts relating to the World Trade Center and Pentagon explosions leave readers in a state of great apprehension as well as seeking answers.  The investigations of fire experts and structural engineers resulted in the conclusion that the temperatures of the buildings were not sufficient to cause the level of explosions that transpired.  Also, what about the third building that exploded?  As for the Pentagon, this is the most protected building in the nation.  Andrews Air Force Base is located just a short distance away.  How could it have been penetrated?  Also, the damage sustained indicates that a missile rather than a plane struck the building.  On a similar note, why was FAA regulations not followed, which called for scrambling any and all aircraft in such circumstances?<br />Griffin covers the question of what might have been known beforehand at the highest levels.  He probes the link between Pakistan intelligence and the payment of $100,000 to one of the alleged hijackers.  The protests on the part of Condoleeza Rice and other Bush administration figures that they had no indication that any terrorist attack was forthcoming by air is refuted by FBI cables.  Griffin meticulously shows us that the warnings were numerous, and that those who provided them were often fired or reassigned.<br />Another major area of investigation that Griffin reveals is the suspicious market activity before 9-11, with put options placed in large amounts forecasting that United and American, the two airlines affected profoundly by 9-11, would experience major share declines.  No explanation has been forthcoming explaining this suspicious economic activity.<br />Griffin has the eye and ear of the trained investigator.  In one superbly laid out chapter he provides a series of points generating the probability that the 9-11 incidents occurred through design at the highest levels.  He then poses other arguments in the direction that the actions resulted from mistakes.  His analytical breakdowns serve as a superb review of the exhaustive information he earlier meticulously revealed.<br />Griffin's ultimate conclusion makes sense.  He calls for an independent investigation providing the necessary funds to get the job done right.  He points out the disadvantages incurred by the current commission headed by Thomas Kean, beginning with time and financial restrictions.  Griffin notes the opposition direct and indirect provided by Bush, Cheney and others in the administration.  The facts must be vigilantly pursued in a timely manner.  Griffin's fine work makes that case in a cool, dispassionate manner, one that appeals to reason and decency rather than emotion.	2004-05-21

A highlight of this informative work is his valuable insights comparing the Patriot Act of the Bush administration and the Alien and Sedition Acts passed by the Federalists during the administration of President John Adams.  Then, as now, attempts were made to squelch opposition as journalists fighing the principle of power immersed in the hands of the privileged few, and allying themselves with the new Democratic Party led by Thomas Jefferson, were arrested and put in jail.  The Federalists sought to maintain the very monopolistic practices against which colonists rebelled with the Boston Tea Party, which was the first major act in breaking the stranglehold of Britain's East India Company.<br />Striking parallels emerge as Hartmann compares the current practices and long-term goals of the Republican right and previous forms of government such as Feudalism, German Nazism and Italian Fascism.  While spokesperssons of the right recoil at the associatiion of such totalitarian practices alongisde what they term conservatism, Hartmann contends that Bush-styled Republicanism marks a strong departure from traditional conservative thought.  He cites the stated goal of rightist tax advocate and stanch Bush ally Grover Norquist to \\"drown government in the bathtub.\\"  Hartmann notes that Feudalism, Nazism and Fascism bore the similarityof of merging cumulative corporate wealth with a central government.  Norquist and other Bush disciples seek to destroy protections traditionally enjoyed by the citizenry, leaving them every bit as vulnerable to a government-corporate elite as were vassals in the Middle Ages.<br />A frightening corroboration of this viewpoint has been realized.  Not that long ago the world's leading corporation was General Motors.  Its employees enjoyed the benefits of a Union Shop promulgating safe and healthy work standards, along with a satisfactory minimum wage, medical care, sick leave, and retirement benefits.  Currently the largest corporation is Walmart.  Its economic dominion is exemplified by the temporary worker stripped of benefits.  This enables an all-powerful employer to subject employees to long, burdensome word schedules devoid of the protections and benefits enjoyed by the General Motors work force.<br />Hartmann sounds another alarm bell in the face of a frightening current trend.  In writing about the dangers of theocracies as manifested in the past, Hartmann warns us a about the dangerous trend in this direction as currently observed in the Bush presidency.  The very messianic message carried by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels to the German people concerning Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, which was destined to endure for a thousand years, is being delivered by Bush and his evangelical Christian base.  Televangelist Pat Robertson recently stated that Bush was certain to win reelection \\"in a walk\\" because he is the handpicked emissary of God.  Bush told Bob Woodward in an interview that, prior to invading Iraq, after he had been asked if he had requested advice from his father, who was president during the first Gulf War, he responded that he had sought counsel from his \\"other father,\\" meaning God.  With the Christian right so strongly anticipating Armageddon, a pervasive danger exists that entrenched evangelical beliefs will override efforts to achieve peaceful compromise in the Middle East and harness to most sophsticated nuclear weaponry alongside primitive religious beliefs.<br />Not only does Hartmann make a convincing case for political change and restoring America from a nation dominated by corporate elitism to the democratic tradition embodied by the principles of Jefferson, James Madison and Thomas Paine; he provides grass roots recommendations for citizens to coalesce toward their goal.  He cites numerous organizations on the Internet and in America's cities, towns and villages that are dedicated to restoring traditional American democratic principles.  As Hartmann notes, the prevailing corporate monolith must be effectively challenged with vigilant, intelligently focused citizen action, and cannot wait for direction in the traditional party structure.  A new group of dedicated Americans needs to emerge in the twenty-first century and commit themselves to the restoration of democracy in the same tradition of the Founding Fathers of 1776.	2004-05-14

Huffington reveals her epiphany, when Harris Wofford, a former civil rights leader with close ties to Martin Luther King, convinced her in the wake of her criticism that the Americorps program he headed in the Clinton administration deserved her support.  Arianna not only reversed course on Americorps, she became an articulate populist who is now one of the most trenchant critics of George W. Bush.<br />The rationale for Huffington's book is stated in her title, bracketing competing political forces into fanatics and fools.  She sharply attacks the Bush administration and the current Republican Party, attaching the label of fanaticism based on what she perceives as destructive policies, 1) in the realm of supporting tax cuts which disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of the rest of America, 2) a jingoistic foreign policy responsible for not only launching a war in Iraq that was unnecessary, but alienating world opinion through a go it alone attitude, 3) shortchanging America's schools, 4) despoiling the environment, 5) leaving America vulnerable to foreign terrorist attack while making bogus claims of making the citizenry safer.<br />The Republicans are defined as fanatics and the Democrats labeled as fools for failing to mount a cohesive opposition.  Huffington delivers a necessary slap in exhorting the troops to shape up after the disastrous 2002 mid-term elections, in which the opposition party failed to provide a clear message and appeared intimidated by boisterous Republican propaganda efforts directed by Karl Rove equating opposition with an absence of patriotism.  Speaking as someone with authentic independent credentials of her own, Arianna bluntly tells the Democratic Party leadership that the only way Bush can be defeated is to stir the increasing number of Americans dropping out of the process with a clear and effective message, a concise and sharply articulated alternative to Bush Republicanism.  Bush Lite, she argues, will do no more than provide Bush More.<br />Huffington, who was a candidate in the recent California recall race for governor before dropping out late in the race, provides an intelligent analysis of Arnold Schwarzenegger from the up close perspective of someone who has known him for a long time, becoming acquainted with him initially when the actor supported her ex-husband in his attempt to defeat Senator Dianne Feinstein in a hotly contested 1994 race.  She notes that he uses his charm to shield himself from criticism, dodging the tough issues.  Despite his \\"moderate\\" tag stemming from issues such as abortion and gay adoption, she notes that on the important money issues that really matter to the Republican Party, Schwarzenegger's positions are in lock step with those of Bush, someone for whom he has expressed deep admiration.  She notes that in honoring his pledge to repeal the controversial car tax, Schwarzenegger reeked economic wreckage in which the blind, students from middle class families hoping to attend college, and welfare single mothers seeking to bring up families were all deprived of needed funds.<br />Huffington writes with a penetrating wit, honed as a debater in her college days at Cambridge University.  It is understandable why right wing Republicans prefer to keep their distance from her.	2004-04-23

Based in London, he commentates and writes frequently and authoritatively on the subject for CNN, MSNBC, BBC, The Observer and The Nation.  He takes the scalpel to the rationale for the United States-Great Britain rush to war with Iraq in the manner of a talented surgeon.  Ironically, Hiro was plagiarized by none other than British Prime Minister Tony Blair as he sought to use his information as a pretext to conflict, receiving a sharp denunciation from Hiro, who opposed the action from the outset.  Hiro demonstrates how the forces of Bush and Blair used facts, such as those written by himself, to their own advantage.  He also adroitly reveals how propaganda was used to create a \\"rally round the flag\\" effect in stirring mass opinion.  He analyzes the story of Private Jessica Lynch in this vein.  In citing the important role played by oil executive as well as Vice President Dick Cheney in the march to war, Hiro refers to his as someone \\"who is for all practical purposes the executive prime minister to a president uninterested in and incapable of running the day-to-day administration of his government.\\"	2004-03-24

He collaborates in this timely work with Eric Alterman, an authority on how that influence operates in lockstep with the media, to promote a favorable right wing agenda.<br />This is a book that is intensively researched and, far from what could be termed a nifty hit piece, it is intstead a reflective work in which Bush policies are critically examined from the standpoint of their disastrous impact on America.  The authors begin with a look at the swaggering manner of George W. Bush and his compatriots, and how this blustery air of bravado has been used as a pretext of selling a &quot;no nonsense&quot; view on government and a &quot;we're in command&quot; presence that is all puff and no substantive reality.<br />Some of the crucial issues covered are:<br />1)  Environmental and energy policies along with the Texas oil connection of Bush-Cheney and their administration are carefully explored;<br />2)  An economic policy which,ironically, is a seemingly mirrored reflection of the Reagan concepts which George W. Bush Senior once called &quot;voodoo economics,&quot; the idea that we can grow our way into prosperity with no residual debt impact through massive tax cuts geared toward the wealthy;<br />3)   The way that Bush skirts around the subject of ethics in the business community by resorting to amnesia in the case of Kenneth Lay and shifty avoidance in other areas;<br />4)   The Patriot Act and all of its tragic ramifications for democracy is another vital area covered; how Bush and Ashcroft used 9-11 to invade American basic freedoms under the guise of necessary protective action;<br />5)   How Bush has energetically pushed privatization in the health care field while making it appear that he fully supports the system, revealing the close connection between pharmaceutical companies and the administration.<br />Two seasoned professionals have amassed massive research and exercised their critical talents to present a meticulous but broadly-based attack on Bush and his politics.  It comes at a critical point during a watershed election that will ultimately decide the future of America.	2004-03-24

The concept of &quot;doublespeak&quot; has reached new levels even for a political world in which spin control had been one of the main currencies of the realm for some time.<br />Paul Waldman begins with the premise adhered to by so many given George W. Bush's long record of grammatical errors and misstatements of fact, that he is exceptionally stupid.  While Waldman considers Bush a far cry from an intellectual, he carves out a shrewdly analytical argument concerning Bush using perceived ignorance as a mask for deceit.<br />Waldman contrasts Bush and his 2000 presidential opponent Al Gore in an interesting manner.  Whereas the studious Gore was classified as a &quot;policy wonk&quot; who never saw a policy discussion in which he did not want to participate, Bush fell into the opposite category.  Here is a man who enjoys clearing brush at his Crawford ranch and watching baseball.  He disdains any type of discussion necessitating deep thought and is known for asking subordinates to shorten outlines to the one or two most basic points.  He does not want to be bothered by devilish details.<br />When the media began reporting the 2000 fall campaign, a pattern emerged.  Bush could make all kinds of mistakes and they would be regarded as innocent little slips based on a lack of study and intellectual curiosity.  Gore would be nit-picked over whether or not he was Erich Segal's focus in &quot;Love Story,&quot; about why he erred in speaking about meeting with someone other than the operative he mentioned at the Federal Emergency Management Association, and whether or not he said he had invented the Internet (He never did!).<br />This same policy has reemerged during Bush's presidency, of giving him free pass after free pass due to his supposed intellectual deficiencies.  Waldman sees this is part of a strategy that insulates Bush from paying the price for a pattern of lying.<br />One case in point stressed by Waldman is Bush's claim that to oppose his tax cuts is commensurate with calling for the raising of taxes.  Waldman is correct in stating that to oppose a tax cut is not the same thing as calling for a tax increase, yet Bush has restated the point seemingly endlessly.<br />Waldman does a superb job of exposing the Bush strategy of deception.  He points out that this rich man's son is anything but the home spun, simple, down home Texan he claims to be.  He also notes the strategy of masking reactionary policies in compassionate words and pictures along with diminishing criticism and a close checking of the facts by insisting that the media is biased in the direction of liberalism.<br />Waldman has a valuable critical facility that enables him to 1) zero in on the important issues, 2) separate them from the non-essentials, and 3) demonstrate how propaganda is used to obscure the real facts.	2004-03-24

The more I read the clearer it was why Morris took a novel approach to history in the case of Reagan.  Since after meeting Reagan many times and researching his life Morris decided that he was a complex figure but someone who was too boring to do a conventional book on such as that about Roosevelt, he decided that weaving some fiction and personal commentary would provide the ticket.<br />This technique would not work with just any historical figure, but Reagan affords a unique case in point.  His presence and oratorical skills developed over a lifetime of acting make Reagan a formidable influence in the right settings, such as speaking to a huge crowd in Berlin and exhorting, \\"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\\"  In his personal life, however, as well as in administrative situations as a governor of California and president, he could seem remote and distant.  Morris explains why, tracing Reagan back to difficult roots in Illinois with an alcoholic father.  He sought to create his own world on the one hand while keeping a distance from people to avoid hurt, a classic response to children who have had to bear difficult early home lives.<br />Rather than providing a regular biography, Morris focuses on the impact Reagan has had on people, which is the most fascinating part of his legacy.  He uses letters to his son Gavin to depict the response of angry young men of the period.  The famous screenwriter and director Phillip Dunne is also used to prove a point as Morris uses his friendship to draw the Hollywood figure into the picture.  He relates what liberals thought of Reagan through the years as the future president gravitated from flaming liberal to staunch conservative.<br />This is the personal side of Reagan interestingly explored.  For those wanting a regular biography the works of authors such as Lou Cannon and Bob Schieffer are more valuable, but for a character study of an interesting and highly unusual figure who achieved a great impact on the world, this is a work that provides highly worthwhile reading.	2004-02-10

He is a conservative with no record of radicalism who  currently finds himself at odds with an administration that has declared war on the environment.<br />On a recent appearance with Bill Moyers on PBS, Stuart Udall, former Secretary of the Interior under John F. Kennedy, conceded that he was both sad and confounded by recent efforts to politicize the environment.  He related that when he was in Congress as well as Interior Secretary that preserving the environment was an issue on which Democrats and Republicans agreed.  There might have been partisan debate in other areas, but the need to preserve a healthy and scenic environment was an area where the parties closed ranks.<br />Under Bush a reckless policy of greed has been followed.  By advocating Alaskan wild life oil drilling, cutting back on poisonous emissions, and abrogating the Kyoto accord, which was an integral part of the fight against global warming, the gauntlet has been hurled down by corporate special interest profiteers, led by big oil advocates Bush and Cheney.  <br />Train points out that Richard Nixon did not favor a strong environmental policy due to a compelling belief in preserving the environment per se.  As a weather vane politician he saw the wisdom in taking a position that would benefit and protect millions of Americans, and so he created the Environmental Protection Agency.  He believed his pro-environment posture would enhance his presidential credentials and magnify his chances of securing reelection in 1972.<br />The current anti-environment brigade does more than oppose efforts to maintain clean air and water; an antagonistic approach has been adopted wherein environmentalists are attacked as dangerous radicals with an anti-business agenda who will cost millions of jobs if their agenda is advanced.  These scare tactics have worked with many, and Train advocates the necessity of returning to more traditional ground.<br />Train is joined in his criticism of the Bush record by the likes of Paul O'Neill and Clyde Prestowitz, who have their own books available examining the Bush record.  Their works demarcate a distinction between traditional conservatism as advanced by earlier Republican presidents and the radical neoconservative agenda advanced by Bush, Cheney and Ashcroft.	2004-01-30

His privileged vantage point provides him with the experience and insight to write a book delineating the potential disaster confronting America from the manipulation of the federal tax system to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the rest of society.<br />Many years ago H.L. Hunt, the Texas oil magnate then reputed to be the world's richest man, revealed his confident arrogance about the federal tax system, indicating that &quot;even if they taxed us 99%&quot; that the wealthy would prevail and pay nothing, leaving the rest of society to bear the responsibility.  He had reason to be confident, as noted by Johnston's informative investigation.  As for ferreting out tax cheats, the current IRS weakesses are appalling.  Johnston noted that after locating the 16,000 worst suspected tax cheats, the IRS then investigated only a paltry 4% of the perceived malefactors.<br />Johnston exposes the gimmick of pandering members of Congress who showboat on behalf of the wealthy to insure continuing tax breaks.  A particularly egregious example was the drama put on by Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, who lost his Senate Majority Leader status for his tribute to former ardent segregationist, Senator Strom Thurmond.  Lott's histrionics focused on perceived abuses by the IRS which were never corroborated.  The performance related to keeping the heat on those who wanted to change the system by presenting the image of an aggressive IRS trampling on the rights of the wealthy patrons Lott sought to protect.<br />While focusing much criticism on presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush for helping skew the federal tax code in the direction of the wealthy through their massive tax cuts, Johnston notes that to attempt to focus too much of the blame on these individuals would be a grave mistake.  It is much broader than these two individuals, as powerful as they were and as fervent as their efforts have been in that direction.  The special interests have woven their magic in bringing prominent as well as less than prominent Democrats and Republicans onto their team with the situation deteriorating over a long period of time.  For instance, remember footage of so-called &quot;seminars&quot; at posh country club retreats?  Scores of these have been organized by the corporate sector to &quot;inform&quot; elected officials from the House and Senate on how to properly deal with the tax system.  Needless to say, these seminars are best conducted in comfortable surroundings.  Unsurprisingly, those who cooperate find themselves back in office, assisted by special interest largesse.  Those who do not generally find themselves out of office.<br />Grover Norquist is a successful tax lobbyist with his own think tank.  He is a prominent adviser to Bush, Cheney, and Rove.  Knowing how the system is played, Norquist has referred to bipartisan congressional cooperation as &quot;date rape.&quot;  As for basic federal programs enjoyed by taxpayers, such as park systems and educational benefits, Norquist takes a harsh view.  He has stated his desire that federal government activity, absent defense spending and anti-crime activity, belongs &quot;flushed in a toilet bowl.&quot;  He knows that if the system is top heavy enough in the corporate direction, with the middle class confronting the burden, that a plutocracy will result more in the tradition of eighteenth century France's pre-revolutionary phase than the New Deal, Fair Deal, and New Frontier administrations of presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Kennedy.  <br />You see, France can be used as a sensible model, after all, by Bush partisans!

His rise up the success ladder is interesting to observe from this key juncture, and Dan Moldea is there with the roadmap explaining much about Reagan's professional and political behavior.<br />In Reagan's early days as SAG president the bitterly divisive House Un-American Activities Committee investigations into the motion picture industry began.  Reagan appeared as a friendly witness, blaming the industry's labor strifes strictly on the American Communist Party.  <br />Moldea's compelling account fills in important blanks.  For instance, the motion picture industry began with heavy influence and control generated by the Chicago Mafia.  He reveals that the conflict Reagan and other corporate spokespersons laid at the doorstep of Communists was not as simple as described, and that mob influence surrounded much of what was happening.  A blacklist was launched to ostensibly destroy Communist influence in the industry while that of the Mafia was not even a subject for discussion.  All strikes were blamed on unpatriotic hotheads parroting the Moscow line.<br />Later,in 1954, when Reagan's career was in worse shape than in the late forties, and when he struggled amid a shrinking bank account to make ends meet, he was in a position to assist the powerful Music Corporation of America, a powerful agency seeking to launch into film production.  Reagan as SAG president led the fight to provide MCA with an exemption that others in the industry were denied.  Lo and behold, the MCA agency which represented him as an actor was able to secure a lucrative contract for him as a host and actor for the new television program, General Electric Theater.  Reagan's career as an actor meaningfully advanced with MCA in the driver'sseat.<br />Later MCA moved into the studio business, purchasing Universal.  Reagan was once more on the scene playing a pivotal role.  He became so popular in the hearts and minds of corporate interests in Hollywood and throughout California that before long he was running and winning the governorship of what was then the nation's second most populous state.<br />Moldea's book reveals how beneficial it was for Ronald Reagan to have friends in high places whose interests he could help advance.  The progress definitely worked in both directions.  Those who regard the confluence of events between Reagan, MCA and other corporate interests and the sudden comeback his acting career and later political successes as purely coincidental would be rejecting common sense and the basic nature of human experience.	2004-01-26

Roosevelt was talking about foreign affairs, but Charles Lewis demonstrates unmistakably that this maxim applies today in the campaign finance realm.<br />Lewis, the head of the Center for Public Integrity, relates  fascinating facts about how the big money of special interests is the big stick that generates the necessary talk to achieve results.  One does not even have to talk loudly, just incessantly enough to achieve the objective at hand, bolstered by the big stick of unceasing gobs of cash.  He lets us know, for instance, that 40 members of the U.S. Senate are millionaires.  These are people highly familiar with big money and its useful application.  He also informs us that surveys indicate that the candidates raising the largest amounts of money will be the respective nominees of the Democrats and Republicans at election time.  He cites an example of one candidate who pocketed money from a pharmaceuticals company and earned it by speaking on the industry's behalf while he was running for office.<br />In a recent interview with Bill Moyers on PBS, Lewis conceded that it was difficult to remain optimistic in the floodtide of corporate dominance through the purse string.  All the same, he noted, seeing just how outrageously the system operates energizes him to make efforts to inform the public about the calamity we face.<br />Abraham Lincoln and Harry Truman have been mentioned repeatedly in civics books to demonstrate to youngsters that with hard work and application an individual from modest roots can reach the presidency.  The staggering reality today is that many politicians have become no more than unblushing bag men.  Such is the case with the presidency itself as George W. Bush spends a significant amount of time away from his White House desk, picking up vasts sums of money at quick stops.  It was suggested recently that perhaps he can avoid the facade of speaking at a dinner where donations are given, saving time by just grabbing the money and moving on to his next stop.  <br />Lewis notes that there is an inverse relationship between the overpowering dominance of big money in campaigns and the participation of citizens.  Many, understandably, after observing the travesty of money chases masquerading as American democracy, opt out of the system altogether.  As the money influence grows, more citizens stay home on election day, a sad and tragic consequence of a system that has run amuck as quests for public office have degenerated into special interest bidding wars.	2004-01-21

Robert Parry is a thorough professional journalist in the best tradition of the late I.F. Stone.  His sharp reportorial instinct was aroused by activities spinning around the 1980 presidential election, in which Ronald Reagan achieved a great breakthrough for the American right in ousting Jimmy Carter.<br />The act on the part of the Iranian Khomeini government of releasing the 444 American hostages being held in Teheran as a protest against President Carter not sending the deposed Shah of Iran back to his native country for trial on the very day of Reagan's inaugural, along with other tantalyzing facts gnawing at the imagination, prompted Parry to go to work in earnest.  Some of his reports from The Consortium, the Arlington, Virginia think tank in which he is involved, were produced on the PBS documentary series &quot;Frontline.&quot;<br />When a Congressional investigation cleared the Reagan campaign team led by William Casey from any collusory wrongdoing with the Khomeini regime prior to the election of making a deal to withhold release of the hostages in exchange for arms, Parry was suspicious.  He was tenacious enough to locate a discarded report from the Russian government in a remote storage room on Capitol Hill.  The report which, no doubt, was believed to have been permanently discarded, revealed knowledge of future CIA director Casey, Reagan running mate George H.W. Bush, and another future CIA director, Robert Gates, having secretly met with Iranian government operatives during the 1980 campaign in Madrid and Paris.<br />While GOP political operatives such as Congressman Henry Hyde and Senator Mitch McConnell were successfully able to squelch any further Congressional investigation into the so-called October Surprise, this controversy turned out to have legs of its own, bolstered by Parry and other courageous Americans seeking the full story.  As the mainstream media sought to dismiss the October Surprise theory, maintaining that the only testimony relates to a few loose cannon Middle East weapons operative types, the story is much more involved.  A former head of French intelligence has corroborated the account revealed in the Russian report, while Ari Ben-Menashe, an Iranian born Jew who was an Israeli secret intelligence operative, testified before Congress that he participated in Paris meetings between senior Iranians and Republican emissaries.<br />This might be history from better than two decades ago, but it is dynamite-laden in its implications for the Reagan legacy, which would have resulted from what amounts to a coup, a dirty tricks pre-emption of the U.S. government to steal a presidential election.  The charge becomes all the more credible based on other instances in 1968 and 2000, when Republican dirty tricks resulted in victories for Richard Nixon and George W. Bush, by respectively destroying peace negotiations by the Johnson administration that could have ended the Vietnam War and scrubbing the election rolls of legitimately qualified African American voters by a team led by candidate Bush's brother Jeb, governor of Florida, and his secretary of state, Catherine Harris.	2004-01-19

In his twenties he owned a brownstone in New York, a house in Paris, a private railroad car, and a four hundred acre estate, The Oaks, on Long Island.  Add to the aforementioned that he was Harvard-educated with all the right social connections, was matinee idol handsome, and was a vice president in the Equitable Life Assurance Society, and it becomes easy to see why many sought his company and others were just plain jealous.<br />Beard's intensely researched work strips the veneer off the visible top layer and reveals that life can be highly disconcerting at the top of society as well.  The difference is the battles that are fought, which, considering the stakes, contain a ruthless intensity.<br />In the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century, in which James Hyde's father Henry flourished after founding the  billion dollar Equitable Life Assurance Society, commercial triumph resulted from truly being in the right place at the right time with the right product.  While income disparities were vast, ordinary citizens seeking to make financial ends meet bought life insurance policies to provide their families with security in the face of often rocky existences.  The resourceful elder Hyde tapped into this desire.  He succeeded so handsomely that big name magnates such as E.H. Harriman and Henry Clay Frick would soon grace Equitable's board of directors.  <br />Henry Hyde died May 2, 1999, a year after his son graduated from Harvard.  Young James was convinced that one day he would follow in his father's footsteps after receiving the proper seasoning, and the person designated to provide that assistance was acting president James W. Alexander, a veteran who had worked his way up the Equitableladder.  He would be assisted, it was anticipated, by Gage Tarbell, Equitable's third vice president and head of sales.<br />The book's title relates to a grand New York ball young Hyde gave on January 31, 1905.  At the time this appeared to be the latest stepping stone up the success ladder for the handsome, witty, urbane New York City executive and socialite.  One of the evening's guests would be another young New York aristocrat who would marry a cousin less than one year later and ultimately surge to inernational greatness and an enduring place in world history, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<br />In a contemporary framework it would appear that perhaps the gifted Hyde would succeed in New York society and beyond in the same manner as Franklin Roosevelt, but whereas the future president was just working his way into the city's and state's limelight with an ultimate focus well beyond those objectives, Henry Hyde's run of bad luck would bear an inverse relationship to the good fortunes of Roosevelt.  Before long his company would be immersed in conflict.  Alexander and Tarbell would turn on him, while Henry Clay Frick, who chaired an investigation into company activities, would so the same.   E.H. Harriman was another formidable force pitted against young Hyde.<br />While Equitable fell into a comparable pattern of excess and wheeler-dealer activity characteristic of highly competitive  New York corporate life, with its agents being provided with excessive advances and state law being violated by selling stocks to companies on whose boards they sat, directing animus against the youngest executive in the ranks appeared to be a case of absolving their own conduct through a designated scapegoat.  In the process they also released pent-up jealousies against one of the dashing princes of New York society, who had dated Alice Roosevelt and visited with her and father Theodore in the White House.  Hyde was also a friend of the period's most famous actress, Sarah Bernhardt.<br />Another highly publicized effort, the Armstrong Investigation, headed by Charles Evans Hughes, later to become Attorney General, Secretary of State and Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, captured many headlines but resulted in no prosecutions.  All the same, the damage was done and Hyde  relocated to Paris.<br />A new phase of Hyde's life began in Paris, where he had earlier headed an Equitable office.  In the manner of a seasoned aristocrat more characteristic of an ancient British family, Hyde ultimately married three times and cut a wide swath in Parisian society.  His only son, Henry, had a large shadow to climb out from under, feeling initially dwarfed by his formidable father.  Eventually he emerged from that shadow and achieved marks of distinction initially in the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, in World War Two, then as a prominent New York-based international lawyer whose client list included prominent film director John Huston.<br />Patricia Beard is able to provide readers with such a fascinating front row seat in boardrooms, drawing rooms and ballrooms of the period due to her close friendship with the Hyde family.  Henry served as godfather to one of her children.  The book serves as both an interesting corporate chronicle of the times as well as providing social commentary wherein readers feel a part of the scene, rubbing elbows with the cream of international society.	2004-01-16

Reading Paul O'Neill's book on his experiences as Secretary of the Treasury in the Bush administration harkens memories of the Reagan White House.  While Ronald Reagan, particularly in the latter period of his second term in the eighties, was criticized for being disengaged and letting others govern for him while he sought to maintain an effective image of the presidency, nobody went so far as to say, as O'Neill did regarding Bush, that walking into a meeting with him was like &quot;talking to a blind man in a room with deaf people.&quot;<br />It has been said of George W. Bush that, even if he receives a memo outlining important subject matter, he will ask that the two or three most important points be underlined, saving him the effort of reading the entire outline.  The worst said about Reagan in a similar vein was that, when Secretary of State James Baker provided him with a fact sheet concerning an upcoming summit meeting with Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev, that he told him he had watched &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; on television instead of reading it.  <br />It appears that reports of Vice President Richard Cheney making major decisions in the Bush White House has more than a little substance behind it, considering revelations in this book confirming that view.  For instance, pertaining to the second huge tax cut embraced by the White House, O'Neill stated that Bush initially expressed surprise, saying that he thought the &quot;rich people&quot; had received enough support through the initial tax cut.  Cheney reportedly pressed the point for a second tax cut, indicating that it was important to grab the mantle and press the point further.<br />O'Neill also writes about the basis for conflict with Iraq, and when Bush considered going to war.  Confirming many other accounts asserting that the decision was made well before September 11, and that Cheney stood in the forefront of the effort, Bush then fell into line and planning commenced in earnest to confront Saddam Hussein.<br />The issue arises as to whether O'Neill's disclosures embody revenge of a fired cabinet member.  His detailed explanation of what occurred, however, appears credible, indicating that he was pushed out due to a fundamental policy difference with the Bush administration.  As a former president of Alcoa who was aware of the need to maintain debt free footing to achieve success, he emphatically opposed a tax cut policy that could push America deeply into debt.  Cheney and the administration's major players did not want someone who clashed with what they felt to be an imperative, a policy of tax cuts on the assumption that added revenue would prevent the arrival of huge deficits.<br />The announcement that the administration is investigating whether O'Neill made available information from classified documents has probably achieved for him the same result as Fox Television's lawsuit against Al Franken.  The added exposure amid controversy should push the book to greater heights of popularity with the mass market of the reading public.	2004-01-14

As someone born and raised in California I was naturally interested in the energy crisis perpetrated in the Golden State by Enron policies designed to achieve total control.<br />McLean was the writer whose Fortune article questioned the value of Enron during its artificially inflated boom period.  This was happening at a time when mountains were being moved to maintain stock at a high level which was beyond bloating, but entered into the realm of the highest scale of fraud.  When the California tragedy surfaced it was none other than former Halliburton CEO and current vice president, Dick Cheney, who exclaimed that the California energy crisis revealed the need of developing more independent energy sources, i.e. drilling in Alaska.  McLean and fellow Fortune writer Peter Elkind demonstrate that the tragedy was internally induced, and not a product of external circumstances, as Cheney and other Bush administration figures asserted.<br />A massive effort such as that unleashed by the Fortune team was necessary to even scratch the surface in a string of machinations which are sought to be performed in the most complex way to create a huge smokescreen and avoid detection.  From both an economic and sociological standpoint the mammoth undertaking of the authors proves that such efforts on the part of top management at companies like Enron will ultimately collapse like a house of cards.<br />As well as providing the essential factual details on how the Enron brigade unleashed their corrupt trickery, McLean and Elkind create visible portraits of the main characters involved in this history of swindles perpetrated on an unsuspecting American public.  Ken Lay, referred to by George W. Bush as \\"Kenny boy\\", is revealed as a feel good CEO whopurposely sees and hears no evil, while Skilling and Fastow are repesented as anything but, operating as consummate forces of power maniacal greed with total control the object that never departs from their corporate radar screens.<br />With this much information revealed abaout the Enron demolition crew as vigilant forces in such a sleazy and rapacious enterprise, the question arises as to how much Enron will figure in the presidential campaign.  McLean and Elkind provide a wealth of material from which a  constructive national debate could be launched.  Let this effort begin!	2004-01-09

Hatfield, Russell Bowen and Walter Tapley.  Another point of interest is that Phillips has seen mainstream Republicanism at the presidential level firsthand, as a former White House operative of President Richard M. Nixon.  <br />Phillips cites the skepticism held by Nixon concerning George Bush I, despite appointing him to positions such as Chairman of the Republican National Committee and head of CIA Director.  When Bush sought the presidency against Senator Robert Dole in 1988, Nixon supported the latter candidate, exclaiming at one point that \\"Bush is the kind of person you appoint to things.\\"  Elder statesman Nixon made it be known that he was uncomfortable with the idea of Bush as president.<br />Political professional Phillips knows that the Bush family story contained skullduggery from the outset, starting with banker and later Senator Prescott Bush, grandfather of the current White House occupant, making loans to Adolf Hitler, which assisted the Third Reich in acquiring pig iron, which was used in its war effort.  Can one imagine what the media outcry as well as the right would have been if Bill Clinton's family had ever been involved in such an enterprise?  Veteran Washington journalist Tom Wicker had expressed trepidation over Bush I becoming president due to his CIA background.  Phillips moves into that arena, demonstrating how CIA contacts were used to assist Bush.  It is particularly interesting how quickly former Bush CIA source, General Manuel Noriega of Panama, was silenced after being arrested for illegal drug activity that the then president must almost assuredly have known about when he headed the agency.<br />Another key area of Bush family double dealing is in the oil realm.  The story of the elder Bush launchingout on his own in the West Texas oil patch is myth.  He arrived in his father's private jet.  As for Junior, he destroyed one oil company, Harken bailing out and selling his stock before it was too late.  When he was investigated for potential anti-trust violations due to insider trading it was none other than his father, then president, who squelched the investigation.  Junior then used father's lucrative contacts to become the front man and alleged primary owner of the Texas Rangers.  The allegedly conservative Bush then helped himself to a large dose of socialism for the rich in enticing local community voters to approve the funding of a state of the art baseball stadium.  As for Junior's baseball expertise, he was the one who traded Sammy Sosa to the Cubs.<br />The most hilarious aspect of all concerning the Phillips book is the complaint from pro-Bush sources that this is just another \\"Bush smear.\\"  To hear this from that source is like the legendary case of being called ugly by a frog.  Bush I achieved the presidency by questioning his opponent's patriotism and exploiting racial themes through Willie Horton and the mandatory pledge of allegiance.  Working closely with Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes in the mud-stained campaign was none other than Junior, then receiving his political seasoning.<br />The valuable lessons learned from Atwater and Ailes served Junior and his leading guru Karl Rove well in delivering one of the most vicious smears in the history of presidential campaigning in South Carolina in 2000 against John McCain, even questioning the Arizona senator's sanity.  All this was being done during a campaign in which Bush, with a straight face no less, promised to create a new and more civil climate in Washington politics by reducing its partisanship level.	2004-01-09

He takes his position forward, bolstered by much research, some by himself, while also by colleagues in his Global Research organization,in which economic patterns in affected nations are closely analyzed. One tragic instance is Vietnam, in which disease epidemics are costing numerous lives.  The wickedness of privatization is the reason as government programs are cut, wages are deindexed, and the nation has neither the capital nor human resources to meet the burden involved.  Another fascinating case study supplied by Chossudovsky is that of Brazil, where a president was constitutionally uprooted so that multinational conglomerates could take over to run roughshod over the economy.  Meanwhile the corporate media refuses to tackle this issue while protesters at World Trade Organization conferences are summarily denounced as scruffy radicals.<br />The word conditionality is used repeatedly.  It is tied in with the causal relationship between governments acquiring loans from the World Bank under terms set forth initially by the 1946 Breton Woods Agreement.  Conditionality is a fancy word for stripping a nation bare, cutting social services to pay back loan money, at the same time allowing multinationals to arrive in the nations involved and assume control.<br />The globalization pattern is what is afflicting America in the global job market.  With nations such as India and Bangladesh brought to their knees by globalization policies, major American corporations can employ cheap labor, displacing Americans, who are summarilythrown on the employment lines.  Thus far this critical issue has not been satisfactorily and openly addressed in the current presidential season, the exception being the candor and courage demonstrated by Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, who has seen this policy disastrously impact on many constituents in a heavily industrialized state where workers are dangerously losing jobs  through foreign displacement.	2004-01-07

This time he has the author of America's Declaration of Independence and the nation's third president, Thomas Jefferson, in his analytical sights.<br />Despite being an admirer of Jefferson's and much of what he stood for, Wills also realizes that he was, as a member of the Southern aristocracy, standing in the middle of the fledgling nation's major controversy, which would ultimately rock America to its foundations, that of slavery.  While Americans who have studied the history of the nation's early years were aware of the highly controversial three-fifths rule, the service Wills performs in this book is to analyze Jefferson's role in the ongoing debate concerning it and deduce that he was able to become presidency on the strength of a rule that was seen as a compromise between the north and the south on the subject of slavery.<br />Wills sees Jefferson as a &quot;Negro president&quot; in that he was the beneficiary of the controversial rule, achieving the presidency as a result of its application.  By having large numbers of slaves counted as three-fifths of a person this segment made it possible for Jefferson to achieve the presidency.  With so many slaves located in states where Jefferson had strength, the three-fifths rule provided a rocket thrust which made the difference in the election of 1800.  The tragic irony is that fictitious votes of individuals who were not even considered persons in the legal sense, and had no right to vote, made the difference.  Slavery ended up serving as a gigantic bonus, providing an electoral boost.<br />This is a debate that is certain to continue, and Wills deserves praise for setting it into motion.  In order to know about ourselves as a people we must tackle all questions, no matter how tough or unpleasant.  <br />Another point Wills covers is that Jefferson's founding of the University of Virginia, which he considered his proudest accomplishment, was also tied strongly to the ongoing slavery debate between the south and the north.  Wills asserts that Jefferson wanted a university in his own state of Virginia to serve as a counter balance to strong anti-slavery sentiments at institutions of learning in the north such as Yale and Harvard.	2004-01-06

After indulging in much wine and food with the legendary director, the 33-year-old writer, who was just starting to earn his spurs as a film scenarist after a luminous period in radio, returned home and told his wife he was certain that Hitchcock would never hire him to collaborate with him on projects.<br />How wrong Hayes proved to be, to the distinct benefit of himself and the great director.  Hayes believed he would not be hired since he frankly criticized some of Hitchcock's earlier films.  As things turned out, Hitchcock admitted he had heard very little of what Hayes was saying.  Instead he focused on his manner, believing him to be glib and confident of himself.  They then went to work on their first project together, with Hayes writing the screenplay adaptation of Cornell Woolrich's renowned short story, &quot;Rear Window.&quot;<br />Steven DeRosa takes us on a fascinating journey with a succinct dual biography of the two men, brilliant creative forces with styles in some ways different, in other ways similar, while also showcasing the four films on which they worked during their collaboration.  Despite his formidable background and lengthy film experience, Hitchcock knew where to tread and how to back off, giving Hayes plenty of suggestions on settings while providing him with all the independence he needed to place his own brand on his screenplays, particularly the masterful dialogue that made him sought after from the time he arrived in Hollywood looking for work.  We learn that Hayes, before working on films, was a smashing success as a writer on the Sam Spade radio series starring Howard Duff and Lurene Tuttle.  It was while cranking out radio scripts and being compelled to meet pressureful deadlines that Hayes developed a discipline that led him later to be branded as &quot;Hollywood's fastest writer.&quot;<br />Another fascinating collaborationwas &quot;To Catch a Thief,&quot; in which the French Riviera settings form a brilliant visual backdrop to a thriller in which Cary Grant plays a reformed jewel thief who is enticed back into action to help the local police catch that period's successor to Grant.  Along the way he finds romance with Grace Kelly, who will not that long afterward return to the French Riviera to reign over Monte Carlo with new husband Prince Rainier.<br />DeRosa provides interesting details on the remake of &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much,&quot; this time, 22 years after the original was released, as a spectacular color film.  We learn how this film, starring James Stewart and Doris Day,was crafted in a way to utilize the good points of the original version while building upon that success and providing excellent original material.<br />This book is a rare effort.  Scarcely ever does a reader receive such a close perspective on the important relationship between two master craftsmen, a brilliant veteran director and a young screenwriter at the peak of his powers.	2004-01-04

He received a call from a woman informing him of something that sounded so incredible that he was inclined to laugh her off as a crank.<br />The indignation of the young woman on the other end of the line after realizing what Webb was thinking about her prompted him to accept her offer to prove her startling claim.  Her comment related to drug traficking by the Central Intelligence Agency.  If he wanted to learn more, she told him, just be in court the following morning.<br />Webb met a beautiful young woman who filled him in on some details of what was happening, after which they stepped inside the courtroom, where her boyfriend, who was serving time for drug trafficking, was part of a hearing.  As the pieces of the story began to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, Webb jumped on the back of the tiger and proceeded full speed ahead.<br />The book's foreword was written by Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a top member of the Black Caucus and representative of a South Los Angeles district.  She cites her shock when she learns about the extent of gang violence and resulting death occurring in her district.  Due to Gary Webb's courageous efforts she is able to learn more.  Members of Nicaragua's Contras, referred to by President Reagan as &quot;morally equivalent to our Founding Fathers,&quot; flocked into Los Angeles as well as San Francisco and launched a successful drug trade, sending proceeds back to Nicaragua for revolutionary purposes.<br />Webb peers into the network of the Contras and CIA, along with detailing the activities of White House revolutionary Lieutenant-Colonel Oliver North.  Webb's startling charges formed the working basis of much of Senator John Kerry's subsequent investigation and senatorial hearings.	2003-12-27
US	52389304	R3N4ZE6DCBG3VK	0393321983	118505272	Strangers on a Train	Books	5	7	8	N	N	An American Dostoyevsky	Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; came out in 1950, attaining prompt bestseller status and intriguing filmdom's master of intrigue, Alfred Hitchcock, enough to fashion a film around it which was released one year later.  Highsmith jolted readers with her gripping realism, taking a basically simple but clever plot and carving out something much more.<br />Highsmith's book focuses on two men in their twenties, Charlie Bruno and Guy Haines.  The former is of great New York wealth, but is troubled and is headed for cataclysmic disaster, which he appears eager to reach fast through his alcoholic dissipation and all-purpose troublemaking.  The latter has worked his way upward from a modest, middle class background in his native Texas to become one of America's premier architects before reaching his thirtieth birthday. <br />Under normal circumstances these individuals would probably never cross paths, but fate intervenes when they travel on the same train and meet as a result of the extroverted Bruno forcing himself on the more introspective Haines, who does not want to appear rude.  When Bruno learns that Haines is faced with an unpleasant divorce situation in dealing with a promiscuous wife, the inebriated Bruno jolts his more stable traveling companion by suggesting that they swap murders.  Someone who avidly reads mystery books, Bruno states that they would each perform a perfect crime since they would each be killing total strangers and there is nothing to link them to their victims.  Bruno wants Haines to kill his father, who is standing in the way of his getting access to the family wealth.  The reason for his hatred of his father is also linked to his slavish devotion to his mother, who is seen as a quasi-deity to the troubled young man.<br />Haines leaves the compartment when Bruno is sleeping off his drinking, convinced he will never hear from him again.  He does, and under the most frightening circumstances.  Highsmith has such a brilliant penchant for plotting mystery that no more will be given away, except to say that the psychological currents and cross-currents put readers squarely into the picture.  The author forces the reader to make judgments of their own about life and death, and how we deal with each, and how authority is correlated with society.  Are the two in opposition to each other? This is one of the probing questions she asks mainly through the interactions of the characters.<br />Highsmith could be referred to as an American Dostoyevsky.  Just as the great nineteenth century Russian author probed the inner mind and the dimensions of guilt within the framework of someone who has taken a human life, the American touches those same roots in an atmosphere of chilling suspense.  Bruno and Haines are characters fastened indelibly into the mind after reading Highsmith's explosive novel.	2003-12-27

He demonstrated in fiction what he feared could happen in reality, that the United States could be lulled into a right wing dictatorship in the belief that the government was operating to keep us safe from tyranny abroad.<br />Lewis' book was penned in the Hitler period, when the specter of war loomed before a foreboding world.  Now a current wakeup call has been provided with this important book.  Authors like Vance Packard were understandably concerned with the way that Madison Avenue was ruling the lives of Americans in the fifties and sixties.  They were concerned about packaging desires through a blinding mass consumption of symbols and advertisements.  Now the situation is far more critical as the authors inform us about the packaging of a war, sending young men and women abroad on the basis of lies served up by an administration that seeks hegemony in an important oil region on the pretext of fighting world terrorism and saving the Iraqi people from brutal dictatorship, and ultimately, to deprive the hated Saddam Hussein from using weapons of mass destruction on Americans.<br />The fact that Madison Avenue was incorporated into battle to sell the war to Americans at home is a highly disturbing event that must be addressed.  Fortunately the authors courageously address this urgent point.  Previously American presidents such as Roosevelt and Truman demonstrated the necessity for war by laying out the dangers to Americans with blunt talk based on then available information.  They did not hire public relations spinmeisters to convince the people they had to go to war for reasons that were being manufactured in order to sell their product.  War is too dangerous a product to be marketed in the manner of toothpaste and videos.	2003-12-22

With that knowledge it is increasingly easier to see how the Scotland-born Buchan was able to write such penetrating spy stories, which contain such a strong tone of believability.<br />&quot;The Thirty-nine Steps&quot; traces the activities of Richard Hannay into the world of master spies.  This gripping first person account details how an innocent was drawn into the grimy world of espionage after an American called Scudder who lived in his Portland Place apartment building contacted him one day, telling him he was about to be assassinated by a group of master spies.  When the act is accomplished Hannay becomes a sought after potential victim as the spy group fears what he might know about their enterprise.  He is also pursued by police as a murder suspect in Scudder's death.<br />Hannay, a former international mining engineer, tells adventure stories about his foreign experiences and uses common sense resourcefulness to prevent the police from arresting him as the suspected killer of Scudder and the spy masters who want him dead for what he might have learned from his former neighbor Scudder.<br />Buchan, a former mountain climber and a distinct man of action, presents Hannay as a man much like himself, using mental and physical resourcefulness to stay out of harm's path.  Scotsman Buchan presents excellent descriptions of chase sequences in the Scottish moors as Hannay hides in and steps through heather and brush, eluding those who chase him.<br />Eventually Hannay is able to solve the case by using logic in the way of Arthur Conan Doyle's presentation of Sherlock Holmes.  Buchan was influenced by Doyle.  This influence is particularly notable at the story's fascinating conclusion.	2003-12-20

They concluded that Hillary had been in Washington too long and had been in too many political fights, prompting her to suffer from paranoia.<br />The last laugh was on the pundits.  As Joe Conason and Gene Lyons sharply delineate in &quot;The Hunting of the President,&quot; the footprints of the far right Clinton-haters are clearly present for those willing to track them.  Conason and Lyons prove to be perceptive trackers as they demonstrate the following:<br />1) The disgruntled Arkansas group consisting of corrupt politicians and state troopers willing to tell stories and sing as long as the money is forthcoming;<br />2) Wealthy bankroller and right wing extremist Richard Mellon Scaife of Pittsburgh, with a seemingly endless cash roll matched by a hatred as seething as it is irrational toward Clinton;<br />3) The media network controlled by Scaife and religious kook Reverend Moon, consisting of &quot;The American Spectator&quot; edited by zealot Robert Tyrell and &quot;The Washington Times,&quot; which runs at steady losses which are absorbed by Moon while it spews right wing vitrol, led by its editor Wes Pruden, whose fundamentalist preacher father was leader of the White Citizens Council in Arkansas.  <br />4)  The pattern of feeding &quot;hot&quot; stories begun in the Spectator-Washington Times circuit to the mainstream media, focusing on certain cooperative reporters such as Michael Isikoff of Newsweek of Newsweek and counterfeit Democrats such as commentator Morton Kondracke.  Once the pattern is completed the mainstream media's reporting of events begun up the grapevine take on an &quot;urgent national significance.&quot;<br />Conason and Lyons lay out the so-called &quot;facts&quot; of the Whitewater transaction, which was supposed to have revealed Bill and Hillary Clinton as crooks.  It reveals the problem to have stemmed from the paranoia and illness of a formerly sound Jim McDougal, who sold the Clintons on an investment in which they were passively involved, losing on the proposition and regretting having paid out any money.  The authors reveal that the first special prosecutor Robert Fisk found no wrongdoing, and that ultimately even the wildly partisan Kenneth Starr could find nothing.  Yet the story persists of alleged Clinton crookedness.<br />Conason and Lyons paint in fascinating hues some incredible characters, country con types out to make a buck any way they could, along with the vindictive Clinton-haters, often motivated by jealousy over the country boy's tremendous success culminating with the presidency.  A particularly fascinating character is Judge Jim Johnson, a disgrace to the judiciary he once served.  As a young man, after hearing a Johnson speech filled by racist diatribes, Clinton walked up to the older man and told him that listening to his speech made him feel ashamed to be from Arkansas.  Johnson never forgot and became a spirited member of the Scaife-bankrolled &quot;Arkansas Project&quot; designed to ruin Clinton.                  <br />Floyd Brown, author of &quot;Slick Willy,&quot; is also depicted interestingly.  Brown, it will be recalled, produced the infamous Willie Horton ad with shocking racial overtones, which helped George Bush I win the presidency in 1988.  Brown is &quot;appalled&quot; by Clinton's lack of ethics.  Do the likes of Scaife, Moon, Johnson, Tyrell, Pruden, Brown etc. have the moral standing to point fingers at Clinton or anybody else?	2003-12-10

The California Governor had a reputation for being unconventional in many ways like Vidal.  When Brown later sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in the 1992 primaries he sought out the anti-establishment ideas he had heard Vidal espouse earlier.  Vidal willingly helped Brown in the idea department in 1992 and the Californian ran a strong and idea-effective anti-establishment primary campaign.<br />Since the sixties Vidal has preached that the American political system has become increasingly beholden to entrenched corporate interests, which is further reflected in an all too often obeisant media.  Now the public has demonstrated an increasing alertness of the captivity as more individuals seek fundamental changes based on Vidal's concepts.<br />Another fundamental idea that Vidal has tackled for many years, and on which the public is finally catching up with him, is the degree of infringement upon basic freedoms, as evidenced by the Bush-Ashcroft Patriot Act.  He also rails against the dangers of the military industrial compex, and how its most reactionary elements have been served by an active intelligence community through the auspices of the CIA and the FBI.<br />Vidal preaches hard core liberty in the best tradition of  Founding Fathers such as Thomas Paine and Benjamin Franklin.  This volume shows him at his best, witty, acerbic, and driving his point home with an economy of effort.	2003-12-02
US	52389304	R24C7PGRGV9JYS	0316172383	695695888	An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Time for Greatness	John Kennedy in his winning 1960 presidential campaign ran with an optimistic message, &quot;A Time for Greatness.&quot;  It emphasized the importance of dealing with problems confronting the nation at the beginning of a new decade, the most pressing being the Cold War and the military and economic challenges posed by the Soviet Union.<br />Boston University history professor Robert Dallek captures the man and his era in the way that he had done with comparable panache in the case of the chief executive who followed Kennedy into the White House following his tragic assassination on November 22, 1963, Lyndon Johnson.  Since so many books have been done on President Kennedy in recent years, the question that emerged was whether Dallek would be covering familiar ground previously traveled by other historians.  Between the new material Dallek unearthed from Freedom of Information Act releases and the Kennedy Library in Boston, it becomes clear that there is indeed enough information that is new as well as fascinating to make this a &quot;must read&quot; for those interested in the Cold War period of America and the dynamic young man who held the presidency during a pivtotal segment,<br />The term &quot;unfinished life&quot; relates to the fact that Kennedy was struck down before completing his first term at the age of 46 after having been the youngest person ever elected president (Theodore Roosevelt assumed the office at the age of 42 following William McKinley's assassination).  When one reads about all that was experienced in Kennedy's life it is hard to conceive of such a life as unfinished, as well as to comprehend that he was only 46 when he died.  So much had occurred that on the surface one, without foreknowledge, would otherwise surmise that Kennedy had died at a very old age.<br />Two interesting elements revealed by Dallek concerning Kennedy's young adulthood stood out.  Dallek writes that perhaps a major reason behind Kennedy's brother Joe's volunteering fora dangerous flying mission behind German lines, which cost him his life, was his natural competition with the brother who was two years his junior.  Brother Jack had been saluted in the media as a hero following his PT boat excursion under challenging circumstances in the Pacific which saved the lives of crew mates.  Dallek believes that this prompted Joe to take a chance of his own to garner hero status.<br />Dallek notes that it was JFK's older, more extroverted brother who had been tapped by father Joseph Senior to become the nation's first Catholic president.  The responsibility devolved upon Jack following his brother's death.  JFK later stated that had his brother been in the identical position he was at the Democratic National Convention in 1956, when Senator Kennedy was narrowly beaten by Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee for the party's vice-presidential nomination with Adlai Stevenson in what would eventually be a losing campaign against President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the tenacious Joe would have found a way to win.  John Kennedy explained that the loss would have eliminated him from consideration in 1960.  By losing narrowly and gracefully, the party had a dynamic new national face who, by 1960, had the support and vigor to capture the presidency.<br />Dallek, with access to the most complete medical records currently available, writes about a man who barely had a pain free day in his life.  The reader is left in awe over 1) the ability of Kennedy to conquer adversity, and 2) the success of the effort to remove such career destroying information from the public.<br />With all the detailed personal information he has unearthed, Dallek has constructed JFK as a flesh and blood human being that one gets to know through the reading experience of this excellent biography.  Another poignant segment is when Dallek details the period in 1961 when Kennedy, a young father, feels an acute measure of suffering after his tense 1961 summit meeting with Soviet boss Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, fearing the prospect of a nuclear conflict, depriving young people such as his children of experiencing life.  <br />Kennedy the peacemaker is correlated by Dallek alongside the vigilant Cold Warrior determined to prevent Khrushchev from realizing the triumph he proclaimed would be achieved by the Soviet Union.  His account of America at the brink during the Cuban Missile Crisis on October 1962 gives readers a feel for what it would have been like to have been leader during such a tenuous moment of world history.	2003-11-30

Bouton's fascinating candor resulted in ringing plaudits.  In &quot;Foul Ball&quot; that probing candor is back.  There is one basic difference between this book and &quot;Ball Four&quot;: in the former case Bouton was writing about an environment he understood; in the latter case he undertook a notable public service endeavor without being remotely aware of the confluence of forces who would coalesce against him.<br />Jim Bouton nobly sought to preserve and restore the historic minor league baseball park in his native Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on which diamond greats such as Lou Gehrig and Jim Thorpe had once played.  He sought to achieve this result by selling stock in the team to Pittsfield's citizens, an endeavor involving personal civic pride without any public funds being sought.<br />Bouton soon realized he had encountered a four-tiered influential opposition combining:<br />1) the town's only newspaper;<br />2) the town's leading bank;<br />3) the town's leading law firm;<br />4) the formidable General Electric corporation. <br />The coalescing forces opposed the park renovation and supported the building of a new stadium.  Bouton argued that community pride would be better served by restoring the old historic park.  If the formidable economic group wanted to build something for the community, he suggested a concert hall as a possibility.<br />The plot thickened when Bouton learned that the corporate machine wanted to build the new stadium to cover up the toxic waste site that existed within it.  He also learned that the newspaper he thought of as belonging to the community was part of a conglomerate based in Denver.  When he sought to contact the CEO based in Denver he never received the courtesy of a response.<br />This excellent book is highly reminiscent of Jimmy Stewartbucking the tide in the small Pennsylvania town he was seeking to remove from the greedy economic grasp of Lionel Barrymore in Frank Capra's film &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot;  Bouton's story is a microcosm of what we see all around us in present society, the commodifying of conglomerate corporate America at the expense of the best interests of communities.  It is imperative to stop this pernicious trend before it consumes the native ingenuity of practical Americans who seek to develop their communities as individualists, preserving the best of the old while forging new ground without being trampled by cumulative economic might.	2003-11-29

Hatfield's book on George W. Bush and family had reached The New York Times bestseller list before its initial run, publisher St. Martin's Press announced that it was withdrawing publication.  George Bush I was seen on national television and snarling that the book was &quot;garbage.&quot;  That is what happens when 1) individuals have more clout than they deserve, and 2) they are unable to refute the message of the author, and so they attack the messenger, an old trick, this time exercised by the candidate who gave us a campaign predicated on Willie Horton and the mandatory pledge of allegiance.<br />The book was fortunately brought out by a smaller company with the integrity to let the message be sent to those who wish to read it.  What inflamed the Bushes was that Hatfield dared to write the unthinkable, posing the issue that Bush II had been convicted of drug possession and that an unexplained period of community service in a Houston ghetto at a time when he was devoting himself to hedonistic hellraising appeared suspiciously out of character.  Hatfield's suspicions were confirmed by the fact that Bush refused to discuss any questions dealing with his life prior to his twenty-sixth birthday, a stark departure from expectations concerning Bill Clinton and his Oxford University days, along with whether or not he inhaled.<br />The Bushes feared this book not because they believed its contents constituted &quot;garbage&quot; but because the record was clear that a candidate for the highest office in the land had led a dissolute life in which family influence served as a launching pad to great political success.  George II's family contacts led to dealmaking with the deep pockets of corporate America along with the oil patch elite.  Hatfield details the pattern of corruption and, alas, has never been refuted.  <br />The right declares that its voices have been silenced, even amid the steady drumbeats of the Limbaughs, O'Reillys, Hannitys and Coulters.  Fortunately the attempted bookburning exercise failed and Hatfield's message reached willing listeners.  The Bush presidency and the positions taken, whether they be tax cuts for the rich or lies about weapons of mass destruction, are logical successors to the backdrop provided by the author's splendidly researched volume.	2003-11-28

This valuable money enabled the Nazi dictator to gain more pig iron and develop his weapons potential.<br />A former intelligence operative himself, the knowledgeable Bowen traces Bush I's links as CIA Director to drug activity, culminating with his bombing of Panama and the civilian casualties that resulted.  Bowen exposes the fraudulent claims of Bush to \\"get Noriega\\" after the CIA Director had used the Panamanian dictator as a valuable intelligence source.<br />The claim that George I was a self-made man in the West Texas oil business is also exposed as a sham by Bowen.  The public relations myth perpetrated by Bush cronies was that the Ivy Leaguer drove into West Texas in a dusty old jalopy and, through proper application, made a fortune.  In reality he flew into West Texas in his father's private jet and used contacts to achieve a fortune.  He emerged as a man of privilege from the beginning who used patrimonious affirmative action to gain fame and fortune.  He emerges, as humorist Jim Hightower quipped, as \\"a man who was born on third base and believed he had hit a triple.\\" <br />Bowen displays prescience in dealing with the Bush sons in one perceptive chapter.  He links all of them to shady dealings and corporate corruption, notably George II and his swift bailout before the roof fell on Harken Energy Corporation, the oil company he headed. Hisfather, then president, squelched the investigation into Bush II's Harken activities.	2003-11-28

Edgar Hoover	Books	5	12	17	N	N	A Stellar Research Effort	Britisher Anthony Summers is a crack researcher who was seasoned in the finest documentary atmosphere available, that of the legendary BBC.  This book is every bit as fascinating as Summers's work on Richard Nixon.  While the Nixon book was entitled \\"The Arrogance of Power,\\" this work on the life and times of controversial FBI director J. Edgar Hoover could well be titled \\"The Abuse of Power.\\"<br />Summers reveals how Hoover was a man in between who was trapped by the same method he used to compromise and place in fear presidents and members of Congress.  A tenacious investigator, he turned his agent-bloodhounds loose on men in power, gaining enough information to compromise them.  The moment an influential House or Senate member would complain about FBI abuse, he would receive a call from Hoover informing of information he held.  At the same time, Hoover was in turn compromised by what the Mafia held on him.  Hoover, an outwardly homophobic director who stated bluntly that he did not anyone of that persuasion working in his Bureau, had a homosexual life he attempted to keep secret.  Frank Costello and other Mafia chieftains let him know that if he threatened their domain they had important information they would use against him.  <br />Another fascinating element of Summers's book is his detailed revelations about Hoover's influence with U.S. presidents.  He was said to have influenced John F. Kennedy's choice of Lyndon Johnson for his running mate in 1960 because Hoover held potentially damaging evidence on Kennedy's womanizing, which would have destroyed efforts to paint the Massachusetts senator as a loyal family man in the hard-fought 1960 campaign against Richard Nixon.  Nixon was a politician who also had reason to fear Hoover.  He was never willing to replace him for that reason, despite an expressed preference to do so.<br />This is a book that takes the readers to the highest portals of power and uncovers many secrets.  Hoover had a profound influence on American politics from the thirties until his death in 1972.	2003-11-08

Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception	Books	5	39	53	N	N	Studying the Record	Political author and journalist David Corn is a regular contributor to The Nation magazine.  He is known for his thorough analysis and research propensities.  His exhaustive investigation of Bush promises versus performance covers important issues that should be in the forefront of next year's  presidential election.<br />One major Bush discrepancy closely examined was his proclamation that he was an \\"outside the Beltway\\" Washington, D.C. outsider, and that he would be elevating political discourse and removing as best possible partisan politics from the national agenda.  From the time he arrived in Washington, Bush, who was never the outsider he pretended to be, has interacted with Tom De Lay and other promoters of partisanship to shape a right wing agenda incommensurate with the voters, over a majority of whom cast ballots for Al Gore in the last presidential election.<br />In seeking to bring us together as a nation, candidate Bush eschewed the very thought that he was a narrow partisan seeking to march to the tune of the special interest groups who contributed mightily to his campaign.  Upon arriving in office he sought a divisive tax cut that favored the very wealthy.  Herein lies another lie or discrepancy in that Bush insisted with a straight face that middle income Americans would receive more substantial breaks from his tax cut than wealthier taxpayers.  Studies reveal this claim to be a sham.  Corn devotes significant attention to the tax cut and Bush's claims.<br />The most significant of all of Bush's untruths was his reasoning behind going to war with Iraq, also covered in detail by Corn.  Saddam Hussein was on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons.  It was necessary to attack him preemptively before he could launch a blistering assault of his own.  When UN inspectors sought to determine if this claim were true, and at a time when Saddam was even destroying weapons of his own, albeit reluctantly, Bush moved quickly, and outside the ambit of the UN, taking America to war.  As America sits in a quagmire in Iraq with no end in sight, we now know that this was a blatant untruth.<br />Bush placed great emphasis on his \\"Leave no child behind\\" educational plan for America.  What we now have is an unfunded mandate with the increasingly fund barren states expected to pick up the tab.  All the while $87 billion is sought for Iraq while almost 50 million Americans are without health coverage and many classrooms are burgeoning in size.<br />When former Niger Ambassador Joseph Wilson honestly reported that the alleged effort by Saddam Hussein to receive beneficial assistance to his nuclear weapons quest from that country was false, suddenly his wife, a CIA undercover operative, is outed by right wing columnist Robert Novak.  This placed her life in jeopardy.  Bush proclaims that we will probably never know the identity of the person who tipped off Novak.  On this point he is sadly believable.  How hard has he tried to locate the cowardly culprit?<br />The right declared that Bill Clinton should be removed from office for lying on an affidavit about an extramarital affair.  The issue, it was said, was lying, which was intolerable for a president.  Have we heard anything comparable from these same individuals regarding Bush?  Corn demonstrates that we are dealing with far more here than one false statement on a single affidavit.	2003-11-03

Here is the reporter who uncovered the illegal government operation of Oliver North in the National Security Council office, which violated federal law by providing weapons, manpower, and logistical advice to the Contras in Nicaragua.  The government did its best to smear the Associated Press and later Newsweek reporter, painting him as unreliable and a man with his own agenda, but ultimately the truth won out.<br />Parry brilliantly documents what the Contras were really all about.  The so-called Nicaraguan freedom fighters which President Ronald Reagan referred to as &quot;the moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers&quot; were instead involved in a major drug networking operation, aided by the CIA.  The result was that scores of youngsters in South Central Los Angeles became drug addicts as they moved their operations into America while battles waged among young gang members over turf control.  When Senator John Kerry sought to expose what was happening he too was denounced as a troublemaker operating against America's best interests.<br />Parry tells about what political correctness really is, and it is far removed from what is depicted by right wingers seeking to pin the tag on liberal critics.  To Parry this correctness takes the form of barking on cue in alliance with and as supplicants to the major commercial interests which hold sway not only over those in political power, but on the media itself.  His efforts to exercise independence of judgment were accompanied by negative reactions from powers in the media as well as Washington operatives.  All the same he prevailed, and hopefully he and others will continue telling their stories despite the fervent efforts to silence them.	2003-10-28

She must exhibit far more than mere treachery.  The femme fatale must convince audiences that what the poor male succumbing to her charms is experiencing is plausibly merited.  She must exhibit the kind of overpowering appeal combined with a Svengali manner to sell audiences that the poor man's captivated fascination is plausibly worth it.  Otherwise the whole story falls flat.<br />Eddie Muller writes about women who accepted that challenge and surmounted it convincingly.  Jane Greer is a classic example.  While only 22 when she appeared opposite Robert Mitchum in the classical noir work, &quot;Out of the Past,&quot; she revealed a native intelligence and air of sophistication of a woman who had been around forever.  Mitchum, while fully aware of her treachery, found himself incapable of turning away until it was too late and he was ultimately doomed.<br />Ann Savage was a former model who found her niche as a femme fatale in one of the most remarkable low budget triumphs in Hollywood annals, &quot;Detour,&quot; directed by independent film genius Edgar Ulmer, who took a no frills, low budget project and carved out a classic by using limited space to commanding advantage.  Tom Neil could not get away from Savage, who exuded a suffocating presence on the hapless musician, who was trying to reunite with his singer girlfriend in Los Angeles.  Savage clearly had other ideas.<br />Marie Windsor was a willowy former beauty contest winner who traveled from her small Utah hometown to Hollywood in search of fame.  Her height was a turnoff initially in her career and she was compelled to work in a lot of low budget westerns before getting her opportunity to shine, which she did in Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Killing.&quot;  Her scenes as the faithless wife in love with gigolo Vince Edwards and her shamefully sadistic usery of husband Elisha Cook Jr. serve as a dramatic highlight of a superb, hard-hitting movie about an ex-con played by Sterling Hyden, who seeks to engineer a holdup of a racetrack on the biggest pay day of the season.  The more Cook begs and implores, the more savagely biting the wisecracks which emanate from Windsor, but in the final analysis the henpecked husband hits back in a way neither she nor Edwards are able to anticipate.<br />Coleen Gray and Audrey Totter are also included in Muller's work.  His penetrating interviews enable the reader to get familiar with the personalities and their lives away from the cameras.  Gray played the girlfriends of Sterling Hayden and Tyrone Power in two noir gems, &quot;The Killing&quot; nnd &quot;Nightmare Alley,&quot; while Totter was the love interest of detective Philip Marlowe, played by Robert Montgomery, who also directed, in Raymond Chandler's &quot;The Lady in the Lake.&quot;	2003-10-28

Books	5	0	3	N	N	America's Conscience	Michael Moore has reemerged as America's conscience with another hard-hitting epic trained squarely on the corrupt and the excessively privileged, who seek to feather their collective nest at the expense of the rest of Americans.  The same man who tackled the head of General Motors for moving his plant from Flint, Michigan and reducing Moore's home town to economic disaster, and who tracked down Charlton Heston to explain his attitude about gun permissiveness in the wake of increasingly alarming national statistics, has struck again, writing once more in his familiarly facile, no-holds-barred manner.<br />Moore once more focuses on how the Bush machine seized power, along with showcasing the elements that brought this coup about.  In the same forceful manner of Molly Ivins and Greg Palast, Moore strips the political world bare of the deceiving sound bites and pursues the nitty gritty.  He tells us what we must know about the real links surrounding 9-11, particularly the close Bush family ties between the bin Laden family and the Saudis.  <br />Moore stood on stage and received an Oscar at the last Academy Awards presentation, reading Bush the riot act for creating a &quot;fictitious war&quot; in Iraq.  He procceeds to further detail his concerns about Bush crises foreign and domestic as we head into a pivotal election in which the nation's future is at stake.<br />Here is someone who writes straight from the heart.  It is Moore all the way and not striped-pants spinmeisters writing his material.  The conviction and sincerity of purpose shine through as one explores where America has headed, as well as how to extricate the nation from the current abyss.	2003-10-08

This compact, hard-hitting work puts the lie to the claim with evidence from numerous well-documented souces.<br />Conason focuses closely on Ann Coulter, who has spawned a cottage industry of Rush Limbaugh style ditto heads buying books extolling the tragedy of left wing bias in the media.  As Conason notes, with her frequent appearances on television, Coulter's experience alone takes much of the starch out of the rightist claim.  The rest is taken out by a careful analysis of the claims she and Bernard Goldberg, angry ex-CBS commentator, make concerning left wing bias.  Conason notes that all sources analyzing the 2000 presidential election noted that Bush received more attention and more generally favorable treatment than Gore.  Conason provides quotes from conservative sources who subscribed to the view that Bush received more positive treatment by the media during the presidential race.  While Gore's every statement was microscopically analyzed, and sometimes false statements were printed and broadcast, such as the flaps over his supposed invention over the Internet, Bush was not pressed in vital areas such as whether he was convicted on drug charges.<br />Conason also tackles the myth that Republicans are more favorable to business than Democrats, and that they are more frugal.  He notes that the most prosperous periods in the nation's history occurred under Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and yes, the Democrat the right loves to hate, Bill Clinton.<br />A reporter as well as book author, Conason has the reporter's gift of compacting many ideas into a small amount of space.  He never strays.  His style is immensely readable and his points well taken.  This is a gem of a book made all the more timely with the approaching 2004 presidential election.on.	2003-09-09

I have since re-read it, a good exercise to test the validity of the warnings and conditional predictions raised by authors Norman Solomon and Reese Erlich.<br />As an integrity test this book rings even truer with the passage of time and onrush of events than when it was first published shortly prior to the invasion of Iraq.  The authors adroitly cite the rush to war and the falsehoods asserted by Bush and minions, focusing on the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" charge.  The authors hit very hard the American contention that the inspections carried out by UN forces were not working, taking the same position as former UN inspector Scott Ritter.<br />The chapter dealing with Depleted Uranium alone is worth the price of the book.  The authors cite the dangers of an eventual epidemic breaking out among invading forces and the general populace, classifying Depleted Uranium as \\"America's Dirty Secret.\\"  As the authors state, \\"Depleted uranium is the material left over from the processing of nuclear fuel.  The U.S. military uses DU as a substitute for lead to fill the core of special ammunition.  Depleted Uranium is 1.7 times denser than lead ... \\"<br />In addition to stressing the potential risk to Iraqi civilians resulting from Depleted Uranium, along with citing the deferential treatment from the media concerning invasion plans, as well as showcasing American unilateralism, the authors also cover the important oil issue.<br />All you had to do was read this book before the war and you would not be one scintilla surprised over the kind and beneficent manner with which Bush and cronies dealt with Dick Cheney's former company, Halliburton, which received such a glorious windfall in post-war Iraq, all without having to go through the bother of competitive bidding.	2003-09-09
US	52389304	R1ENPD6ADSCAJ5	0743226917	302007279	The Emerging Democratic Majority (Lisa Drew Books)	Books	5	6	12	N	N	Is a New Cycle Beginning?	In &quot;The Emerging Democratic Majority&quot; authors John B. Judis and Ruy Teixeira step into the same shoes previously worn by historians Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Kevin Phillips.  While Schlesinger in &quot;The Cycles of American History&quot; wrote about an America he saw in alternating ideological shifts between liberal and conservative forces, former Nixon operative Phillips foresaw an idelogical seatide change in &quot;The Coming Republican Majority.&quot;<br />Judis and Teixeira see America at a current crossroads in which liberals under the banner of the Democratic Party will achieve ascendancy and become the dominant force in America's two party structure.  Kevin Phillips, who earlier prophesied the move toward conservatism and the Republicans in the late sixties, beginning with the election of Richard Nixon in 1968,recently indicated his belief that the pendulum is swinging back in the direction indicated by these authors.<br />&quot;The Emerging Democratic Majority&quot; breaks down the demographics of the nation in highlighting the trend the authors see developing.  A major group providing the liberal cause with optimism is that of working women.  The authors note that, in the 1960 election, men preferred John F. Kennedy to Richard Nixon whereas the Republican candidate was preferred by more women.  The gradual change toward Democratic Party preference by women has been their strongly evolving role in numbers and importance in the workplace.  At the time Kennedy defeated Nixon by a razor thin margin women were basically homemakers, reflecting more conservative views than currently reflected by females seeking to achieve opportunity and justice in the workplace.<br />Judis and Teixeira also see Democratic breakthroughs among minority groups.  It is a well documented fact that Democrats have made strong inroads in the African-American community.  The authors cite current numbers indicating strong inroads as well within the emerging Latin community, with increasing numbers of immigrants emigrating from not only Mexico but Central and South America, as well as with Asians.  The authors cite an immigrant friendly attitude more befitting of liberals, with Conservatives identifying increasingly with entrenched wealth and the Old America that is rapidly changing in contrast to the emphasis of programs emphasizing enriching new opportunities.<br />The authors indicate that, as with the Goldwater landslide loss in 1964 and subsequent Conservative victory with Reagan in 1980, Democratic past losses nonetheless generated inroads that should pay current dividends.  The McGovern anti-Vietnam War message in 1972 brought a group of younger idealists into the Democratic fold while in 1984, when Walter Mondale honestly asserted that he would need to raise taxes should he be elected, numbers of emerging professionals identified with the message, bringing some new faces into the Democratic Party.  As frequently noted, Mondale was proven correct.  He revealed that whichever candidate was elected, raising taxes under the then economic climate was inevitable, as was learned when President Ronald Reagan raised them in his second term after vouchsafing that he would not.<br />An important element stressed by the authors was not followed in the 2002 elections.  Voters must be given a clear choice.  Blurring distinctions only aids the Republicans with their advantage in fundraising due to their close identification with corporate special interests.  The Democratic Party therefore needs to present a clear cut choice rather than a blurry echo.	2003-09-08
US	52389304	RJB6A05BPG51U	006055424X	345073532	Saving the Sun: A Wall Street Gamble to Rescue Japan from Its Trillion-Dollar Meltdown	Books	5	8	12	N	N	The Ups and Downs of Japanese Banking	&quot;Saving the Sun&quot; is a masterful work detailing not only the reasons for the collapse of the Japanese banking system, but of the problems encountered by bankers and investors from disparate traditions seeking ultimately to speak one economic language.  One of the major reasons why the book resonates is due to the unique qualifications of Gillian Tett to pen such a challenging work about a nation which, to many westerners, remains shrouded in exotic mystery. Tett was trained as a social anthropologist, gravitating into journalism and rising to become Tokyo bureau chief of the prestigious Financial Times.<br />Tett is able to wear two hats simultaneously, providing us with a more entertaining as well as informative work due to her sociological as well as economic insights.  Rather than supplying a series of charts explaining what happened to Japan's banking culture, Tett instead supplies an informative analysis of events by focusing closely on the movers and shakers from Japan and America involved in the volatile existence of Japanese banking from the nation's crushing defeat in World War Two to post-9-11.<br />The tide of events is organized into basic categories, all flavored with the insight of a trained financial journalist telling her story in the manner of a perceptive novelist.  The story is seen from the perspective of Long Term Credit Bank, one of the nation's most revered institutions, which soared like an eagle during Japan's heady days of economic expansion, then descended like a wounded duck in the wake of a sea tide of bad loans occasioned in large measure by inflexible cultural traditions.  When its hapless president, LTCB veteran Katsunobi Onogi, was ultimately arrested and successfully prosecuted for covering up series' of bad loans concerning which he was expected to take diligent action, he lamented that he was victimized by a tradition that mandated such an attitude.  Tett reveals the tragic results of a tradition in which, whereas Swiss and American bankers expected losses to be written off and no more money extended to the distressed subsidiary banks and companies, the powers that be believed that the economic system should be treated as a family.  To cut off such institutions  involved, in the Japanese view, a divorce rather than a necessary business move.<br />Tett demonstates the markedly different ways that the Americans and Japanese see the overall economic picture, along with basic differences in how work forces are observed, when she writes about the purchase of the collapsed LTCB by an American team led by Kentuckian Tim Collins, friend and confidante of President Bill Clinton.  The American group led by Collins changed the name of LTCB to Shinsei, then set out to achieve a profound positive change.  Never is the disparity between American and Japanese cultural viewpoints more evident than when Collins and a team of Americans decide to have lunch in the bank canteen.  The extroverted Kentucky business giant and his group, which includes Vernon Jordan, seeks to socialize with members of the work force, who have never seen such a display in their lives, sticking to their own small clusters of co-workers and disdaining fraternization.<br />Gillian Tett has provided the reader with a great service.  This book provides an opportunity to understand the economic strategies of the Japanese economic system and the cultural divide that often permeates interaction with Americans who disdain tradition for a practical &quot;bottom line&quot; operating pattern.	2003-09-06

The judge hearing the case thought so as well, dismissing it immediately with prejudice.<br />This was not one of Fox's shrewder moves.  Franken is not a low seller to begin with, but with this free rocket blast of publicity his book jumped to Number One on the Amazon.com list before it was even available for shipping.<br />Franken begins his shrewd and humorous tome by embellshing upon an incident many of us saw nationally televised on C-Span 2, a joint appearance of Franken's along with fellow liberal humorist and author Molly Ivins and his arch nemesis Bill O'Reilly of Fox fame at the Booksellers Convention in Anaheim, California.    When Franken began explaining how O'Reilly had insisted he had won a prestigious Peabody Award while hosting Inside Edition, former Saturday Night Live writer Franken demonstrated conclusively that this was not so.  O'Reilly became so apoplectic that, as Franken notes, he wondered if violence would ensue.  In his book he expunges O'Reilly's claim of being an independent voter by producing a copy of the commentator's voting application in New York State, which reveals him clearly to be a registered Republican.<br />While keeping the jokes hot and heavy, Franken, in the manner of British writers such as Alexander Pope, uses humor to prove critical points.  In this effort he is assisted by Team Franken, a group of bright Harvard University graduate students who assisted him in the important research department.<br />Fox had reason to be unhappy with Franken for more than his material dealing with O'Reilly.  He takes on Sean Hannity as well, exploding his contentions about Clinton on military preparedness opposite Ronald Reagan, and concerning his claims that liberals have not achieved prosperity, pointing to Clinton's admirable job creation record.He also pokes fun at a ploy he thinks reflects Fox News head Roger Ailes's cynical sense of humor, adding passively likeable moderate Allan Colmes as a quiet foil for Hannity, billing their joint meetings in a liberal vs. conservative context.<br />Franken supplies a hilarious chapter that appears to be straight out of his Saturday Night Live days about the Chicken Hawks at war, led by George W. Bush with Bill O'Reilly, Phil Gramm, Bill Bennett and Dick Cheney supplying additional muscle.  <br />If you like good humor and satire, along with well researched documentation trapping television and radio purveyors of error, this is a book for you to read and enjoy.	2003-08-30

An articulate debate champion with a Master's from Cambridge University, Huffington was fortunate enough to realize that dream and live the good life.  Unlike some who have made it, however, she identifies with the people rather than the aristocracy.  Her passion for fairness is manifested on every  page of this masterful work, in which she dissects corporate greed in America and argues for justice.<br />Huffington provides chapter and verse when it comes to exposing corporate corruption, taking on Lay, Koslowski, and an entire pantheon of CEO greedmongers.  Her penchant for research and knowledge of economics serve her well as she examines some of America's leading corporations, detailing how and when they went wrong and how the general citizenry has suffered as a result.<br />Since Huffington wrote her book she has been diligently continuing her pursuit of economic justice.  As a candidate for governor in the current California Recall she has served the public interest by identifying Arnold Schwarzenegger for who he really is rather than what he purports to be.  She pointed out his meeting with Kenneth Lay of Enron.  When questioned about her comment, The Terminator pled memory loss.<br />Huffington also has used her star power and current candidacy to reveal just how and why California's Governor Gray Davis has been used as a scapegoat by being blamed for an energy crisis and subsequent debt disaster he sought to prevent.  Meanwhile the champion of California deregulation, former Governor Pete Wilson, masterminds the campaign of Arnold, who is committing himself to reform and terminating California's economic problems.  Arianna will devote much time between now and the election to this disparity.  Her book skillfully reveals her game plan for economic justice.	2003-08-16

An outspoken populist, Hightower in \\"Thieves in High Places\\" pursues the same agenda those of us who have become familiar with his speeches and lectures have heard and admired.  He rightfully selects the Bush Family as the First Family of the Special Interests and catalogues the areas in which America is being taken away from the people and placed in the special repository of the privileged.<br />In the manner of BBC and Guardian reporter Greg Palast, Hightower goes beyond excoriating George W. Bush for his empire plans and vigorous pursuit of a special interest agenda and assiduously pursues the corporate establishment as well.  He points out that what is good for Wal-Mart is not necessarily ideal for the American people.  Like Palast, Hightower sees a disturbing relationship in which wealth becomes excessively entrenched in significantly fewer hands.  Traditionally in world history, if such disparities are uncorrected, famine and ultimate revolution from desperation occurs.  <br />With the media soft pedaling populist messages to serve the commercial interests paying for air time, Hightower assumes an important position of being a spokesman for the people.  He rails against the Kleptocrats who both twist and violate laws to achieve gluttonous results while more people drop below the poverty line.  The safety net Clinton sought to establish has been dangerously destroyed.  Hightower provides the kind of wakeup call America needs during this apprehensive period of history that is so shrouded in uncertainty.  All the while the citizenry feels increasingly alienated, as evidenced by decreasing voter participation.  Hightower supplies a pep talk, telling people that to quit is destructive and that power resides in numbers, stimulated by motivation to evoke progressive change.	2003-08-16

Blumenthal shrewdly realized the Republican strategy of turning off all but the strongtly committed Republican vote and sailing to victory in the midst of a generally disenchanted electorate.<br />As a senior adviser in the Clinton White House, Blumenthal had a participant's view of the action as the Republicans tried the same strategy on the former governor from Arkansas.  When the Republicans were not able to derail \\"Bubba\\" in the voting booth they attempted Plan B, seeking to remove him from office through the impeachment process.  As the Ken Starr prosecutorial scheme used the largesse of billionaire right winger Richard Melon Scaife to unleash a viciousness unseen in American politics since 1988 and, prior to that, Richard Nixon, the attackers denied what they were obviously doing.  Instead they sought to attack Blumenthal and Clinton for using the media against them.  The sad travesty involved a leak to scandalmonger Matt Drudge that Blumenthal beat his wife Jackie, which was picked up dutifully through the Republican network, despite the attackers not possessing a single thread of evidence.<br />As a senior adviser dealing with communications, the Starr brigade and Republican right in general sought to use Blumenthal as a target, making him appear as a master Machiavellian who was launching smear tactics against them.  He ended up spending [money amount] defending himself against their baseless charges as he was compelled to testify before a grand jury and during the trial against Clinton.  He ultimately dropped his suit against Drudge due to the sheer expense involved.<br />In addition to providing an insider's view on how the network seeking to remove Clinton from office operated, Blumenthal also recounts Clinton's triumphs in foreign and domestic policy.  He cites the tragedy of Clinton having to face an impeachment trial for an extra-marital sex act when the specter of Bin Laden and terrorism loomed large before America and the world.<br />Blumenthal's informative work has plenty of the Boswell and Kafka in it, the Boswell stemming from his chronicling of Clinton's world as chief executive, supplying interesting factual details as Boswell did in detailing the colorful life of London's legendary Doctor Samuel Johnson.  The Kafka emerges in his recounting of the scurrilous relentlessness with which the Clinton haters pursued the author en route to seeking to destroy the president he served.<br />This is great reading for any concerned Americans seeking to learn more about the political process from the sublime to the truly lamentable.	2003-08-15

Growing up in suburban Pittsburgh, Height, now 91 and still busily at work, saw discrimination and never flinched, determined to meet adversity with an agile brain, a strong body, and an indomitable will.<br />As a high school girl she won an impromptu speech competition at the county level, then was forced to confront the ugly tentacles of segregation when she sought to find a place to stay as she competed in the finals in the Pennsylvania capital of Harrisburg.  She learned that she was the only African-American in the competition.  When she sought a drink of water prior to her speech, it was the only other person of color in the building, an African-American janitor, who escorted her to the drinking fountain.  Height won the competition by tying her speech theme, the Kellogg-Briand Peace Treaty, to efforts of the black race to overcome adversity.  She explained to an enthralled audience that, just as peace can only be accomplished through purposeful unity, such is also the case with respect to the races.  Height won that competition.<br />After achieving straight A's at New York University, Height went to work for the YWCA in Manhattan.  This was the beginning of a stellar career that took her to the pinnacle of African-American leadership in the women's movement, and ultimately led to a Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Citizenship Award conferred on her by President Ronald Reagan in 1989.  Height refers to two strong women of principle and achievement who served as role model beacons for the bright and enterprising young woman.  First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was someone she would admire and come to know well.  Her other major influence was the daughter of slaves, the remarkable Mary McCleod Bethune, who would overcome a painful asthma condition to become a leading achiever for women of all races, and who founded a college, Bethune-Cookman in Daytona Beach, Florida.<br />As a professor at Moorehouse College in Atlanta in 1945, Height met and taught a remarkable 14-year-old as part of the school's gifted student program.  She saw the promise in young Martin Luther King and was by his side at the 1963 March on Washington organized by prominent labor leader A. Philip Randolph, the president of the sleeping car porters' union,with whose vision for racial progress she synchronized.<br />In terms of the present, Height sees the Democratic Party as taking African-Americans for granted and Republicans of being neglectful of their needs and aspirations except when it serves their purposes to be attentive.  All the same, rather than lament conditions, she remains the eternal pragmatist.  She realizes that the road to progress can be best realized in the way that the great A. Philip Randolph outlined, by uniting and working diligently to achieve purposeful goals, by lighting candles rather than cursing darkness.	2003-08-04

Bush and the Southern Takeover of American Politics	Books	5	14	17	N	N	An Important Message	Michael Lind, like David Brock, understands the inner workings of the American right as one who formerly camped under that tent.  A protege of William F. Buckley Jr., Lind, like Brock, was horrified by the perpetual vitrol extending from rightist circles masquerading as policy, along with the capitulation to the most egregious elements of corporate greed.  <br />Lind's thought provoking work &quot;Up From Conservatism&quot; provided valuable insight into why Lind left the movement.  In this current work he provides a working political philosophical genesis of George W. Bush's underpinnings.  Lind sees Bush as a product of the most archaic West Texas thought.  The most reactionary of this sagebrush breed feels comfortable with laws such as the Patriot Act and sees subversives uncomfortably lurking from beyond every corral.  This is the mindset that affected Bush when, after a black man was dragged to his death from a car in a hate crime occurring in Texas which shocked people of conscience throughout the world, Bush as governor did not even ask the victim's grief-filled daughter to sit down when she visited him in his office and sought to implore him to support hate crime legislation then being considered.  This West Texas twisted brand of machismo was what prompted Bush to spend an average of 15 minutes considering final death penalty reprieve pleas.  In the case of one woman, for whom conservative televangelist Pat Robertson and others of his persuasion sought clemency, a prisoner who wanted to stay alive to continue working with female drug users behind prison walls, in a widely reported television interview then Governor Bush made fun of her by imitating her voice in a high-pitched falsetto.  This attitude also exclaims why, as commander-in-chief, when he learned that the first bombs had fallen on Baghdad, Bush reportedly thrust his fist into the air and exclaimed, &quot;Feels good!&quot;  Unlike Clinton and Gore, who included many public policy books in their reading, Bush prefers biographies of baseball players.  Once more, this is a macho good old West Texas boy at work!<br />Lind's finely reasoned work explains how this type of macho anti-intellectualism which Bush espouses works against America and its relations with the world.  The West Texas rhetoric sadly oversimplifies, leading to the conclusion that America must be right and any nation choosing to disagree with our policies must be wrong.  This leads to ridiculous responses, such as the renaming of French to Freedom Fries by the proprietor of a Beaufort, South Carolina restaurant.  Once more, the good old boy network was at work, substituting runaway male hormones for reflective thought.  This is the segment which loves the neocon preventive war concepts of Cheney-Rumsfeld-Perle-Wolfowitz.	2003-07-29

They traced the rise of often penniless young men to the high pinnacles of economic and social power.  I do not know if Wasserman read any of these stories in his boyhood, but he certainly ended up living them.<br />Beginning as a theater usher and later becoming a musician, Wasserman hooked up with Jules Styne and began booking musical acts.  The dynamic duo recognized that the swing era of bands, which was their bailiwick, would have a limited life span.  The Music Corporation of America then expanded into the world of motion pictures, retaining the name of an organization that sounds like and began as a company rooted in the movie field.  One of Wasserman's clients in the late thirties was a young actor under contract to Warner Brothers by the name of Ronald Reagan.  He would later be in a major position to assist Wasserman and MCA both as president of the Screen Actors Guild and beyond that as U.S. President.  Reagan would always remain a bit miffed, however, that Wasserman, who developed solid relationships with presidents Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton, would retain his reputation as a loyal Democrat and hence supported Reagan's opponents.  The firm was crafty, however, in keeping a foot in each camp, with Jules Styne and Taft Schreiber supporting Republicans assiduously.  This factor helped when Reagan and Richard Nixon were in office.<br />Connie Bruck has provided an impressive body of research, including numerous interviews with the late Wasserman as well as those who worked with him and knew him well.  Her industry pays off in the form of a fascinating study of a man who rose meteorically through the agent's ranks to become the supreme giant of the motion picture industry, the man others feared and envied, often at the same time.	2003-07-22

In this illuminating work the host of the critically acclaimed Global Research website takes widely acclaimed and often repeated media assumptions and sharply refutes them, providing a chronology and road map behind 9-11 and related events.<br />One major assumption that the sagacious Chossudovsky confronts is that of &quot;blowback&quot; apropos 9-11.  In essence, in that we were involved in seeking to combat international terrorism, it is only logical that these efforts have been blown back at us through the tragic 9-11 attacks.  The author notes that, with the numerous contacts between the Bush family and the U.S. government and Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, the blowback theory has no validity.  He notes the linkage between the U.S. government and particularly the CIA and bin Laden extending from 1979 in Afghanistan, when, amid reported anxiety to thwart the Soviet Union and challenge the regime then in place that Moscow supported, a decision was made to back the Saudi terrorist and the radical Islamic network of which he was a part.  The author draws an axis involving the CIA, Pakistani Military Intelligence, the Taliban and bin Laden's Al Qaeda Network.<br />A large part of the book involves a necessary topic area that has been nervously glossed over by conventional American media sources for good reason; it hits too close to home and indicts the largest international energy conglomerates.  The author spends much time examining the link between big oil and public policy.  In terms of providing vital information, this compact volume provides more valuable information in one chapter than so many contemporary volumes do with many pages on 9-11 and related events.  The Trans-Afghan Pipeline chapter is a compact gem, detailing the aspirations of the CentGas Consortium in theregion.  Chossudovsky demonstrates that the frequently repeated and fallacious Bushie shibboleths of getting Saddam before he gets us are rhetorical sallies designed to inflame public opinion by skirting around the important truths that only a few courageous authors such as himself dare reveal.<br />In the wake of the current problems experienced by the Bush administration and pre-war statements concerning Iraq and its military capabilities, Chossudovsky's book contains an even sharper ring of necessity.  Its bullseye clarity cuts through the morass of Bush verbage, daring readers to examine the pure, unvarnished truth of a nation using its military and intelligence capabilities to control the global oil market on the pretext of making the world a safer place.	2003-07-17

Since his viewpoint is anti-militarism in the Bush preventive war context, his enemies are indeed frustrated that they cannot dismiss him as a lily-livered pacifist in the way that the right seeks to dispatch military critics from Vietnam to the present.  <br />A former weapons inspector in Iraq, Ritter tells the unvarnished truth without any political spin about that troubled Middle East nation and what was really happening during that critical period when inspectors attempted to analyze just what was occurring in that nation.  He has been consistently vindicated in his claims that the weapons of mass destruction argument, which was the cornerstone of the pretext for invasion, is false.  Ritter warned before America invaded that it was getting into a quagmire of Vietnam magnitude.  Events have proven that claim valid.  Compare the statements of Ritter regarding weapons of mass destruction and Iraqi military capability alongside those of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Powell and clear differences emerge.  The reports of the latter have been sketchy and lacking in substantive foundation.  Ritter, conversely, has been vindicated as U.S. troops have become bogged down in a bottomless pit with no end in sight.  For the first time, poll figures reveal that Americans believe the current price being paid in loss of life and injury to be unacceptable.<br />Ritter's conclusion in this timely work is, apropos his style, straightforward, directly to the point.  When the subject of regime change is broached, Ritter believes that it needs to be achieved right here at home.  Regime change begins with new American leadership with the vision to see the entire picture rather than deal in tawdry image creation and spin control.	2003-07-15

This reflective work demonstrates that he knows far more about what conservatism traditionally encompasses than the frantic neoconservatives of the Ann Coulter and Mona Charen stripe.  <br />Prestowitz persuasively argues that the bedrock of conservatism is evolutionary growth.  Traditional conservatism differs from traditional liberalism basically on emphasis and government experimentation, with the liberal being more willing to resort to government action and the conservative adopting more of a  &quot;prove it to me that it works posture.&quot;  As Prestowitz notes, traditional conservatism adheres to upholding and building upon international law and the framework of existing traditions.  It is a philosophy that also adheres to a civil libertarian posture on civil liberties, totally apart from the philosophy of Bush-Ashcroft of incarcerating first and asking questions later.  <br />Conservative leaders of the past such as Dewey, Eisenhower, Willkie, Nixon and Ford favored strengthening American ties through international institutions such as the United Nations and alliances in which America is a willing partner rather than a ruling master.  Eisenhower was so staunchly opposed to the idea of preventive war that the former supreme allied commander of World War Two stated bluntly as president that he did not even care to talk to anyone who espoused the dangerous idea.<br />In order to contrast Prestowitz alongside the neocons of the Bush Administration, who abhor international cooperation and flaunt unilateralism in an aggressive form, it is interesting to examine the roots of some of the most ardent Bushies, which extend to Trotskyism.  A conservative is careful about uprooting tested tradition while the neoconservatives call for abrogating treaties and keeping their gun powder ready, indicating a readiness to attack unilaterally.  Prestowitz is a true conservative while the neocons are dangerous radicals operating under the bogus agenda of liberation and freedom.	2003-07-15

Everyone, he said, was entitled to 15 minutes of fame.  Norman Mailer, who just turned 80, has long bypassed that standard.  He became instantly famous with the publication of his best selling novel about life in the trenches in World War Two, &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;, in 1948 at the age of 25.  Here we are 55 years later and Mailer is still busily at work cranking out books.<br />&quot;Why Are We At War?&quot; contains a novel twist on Mailer's part, in which he engages in a dialogue with a fellow New Yorker.  We receive some interesting insights on what it was like to be in the city in midtown Manhattan when the tragedy of 9-11 erupted.  The smoke in the background is described as well as the rapid migration uptown away from the scene of the Twin Towers tragedy.  Men in suits are described running uptown, not knowing whether their lives are in immediate jeopardy.<br />Mailer writes emphatically that a link was not established between the events of 9-11 and Saddam Hussein's Iraqi government.  He believes that a thorough investigation of 9-11 is needed in which all the available evidence is revealed, a point so many of us continue to make along with the veteran author, who won a Pulitzer Prize for writing about and arguing effectively against American involvement in Vietnam.<br />Mailer also writes interestingly about the differences he perceives between the manner in which Bill Clinton delegated power as president alongside the operating pattern of George W. Bush.  His insights are crisp and direct, making this an interesting reading experience.  As always, Mailer is original and fascinating in his revelations, never subjecting us to boredom.	2003-07-12

He continued that coverage when Reagan assumed the governor's office in 1965 until when he stepped down after serving two terms in January 1975.  When Reagan became immersed in the national picture, beginning his quest for the presidency, Cannon was there, ultimately covering his entire two terms as president with the Washington Post.  His ready access to Reagan and extensive knowledge of the politician and the man provided him with an excellent position to provide the definitive work on the Reagan presidency, which he impressively fulfills with this insightful volume.<br />With his strong ideologically conservative roots, Reagan has been subjected to polarization in the manner that liberal politician Robert Kennedy was as well.  In each case, the man is a lot more complex than stereotypical label pinning and instant analysis reveals.  Opponents of Reagan depict him as someone wholly out of his depth and disengaged in the important elements of running a government.  Reagan devotees see him as a man of brilliant instincts who, while not exceptionally well read or cerebral, had an uncanny instinct for doing the right thing.<br />The Reagan that emerges in the pages of Cannon's book is someone with impressive social gifts, leading to the ability to be liked in the manner of previous popular presidents such as FDR and Eisenhower who was, at the same time, highly passive in key areas and all too quick to rely on subordinates to make policy.  At the same time, on certain issues about which he strongly felt, he would become actively engaged, seeking to carry out those policies, even if he many times had only a sketchy knowledge of the particulars.<br />This dichotomy within Reagan ultimately cost him dearly in the case of Iran-Contra, after which he rallied in an area that shocked his supporters of the hard right, that of arms control and a mutually beneficial rapport he developed with Soviet boss Mikhail Gorbachev.  <br />Lou Cannon was there from the beginning of Reagan's career to its end and the closeness of the involvement definitely shows as one reads about the Reagan presidency.	2003-07-12

Ann Coulter's \\"you are either with me or against me\\" approach delineated in her latest work necessitates asking some basic questions once one accepts her basic premise.  In Coulter's view those who have cooperated in defiling and demeaning the reputations of Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, two patriotic bulwarks in the fight against Communism, have provided aid and comfort to the enemy and are inevitably traitors.<br />One person we would have to put in the traitor category according to Coulter would be the political ideological father of Ronald Reagan, Arizona's Senator Barry Goldwater.  It was Goldwater, after all, who went to the White House that summer of 1974 to convince Nixon that he had no support in the U.S. Senate and needed to resign the presidency rather than face an ultimate Senate trial he could not win.  Afterwards he referred to Nixon with great frequency as a \\"phony\\" and praised the work of the Washington Post's Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who exposed Nixon. Since Goldwater was a major player in this \\"cabal\\" to bring down one of Coulter's favorite patriots, he must have been a traitor.<br />After Nixon left office in disgrace a whole phalanx of Republicans, including subsequent GOP presidents, shunned Nixon like the plague.  Since the destruction of Nixon was part of a liberal cabal then we must assume by Coulter standards that presidents Gerald Ford, and yes Ronald Reagan, as well as George Bush I were part of it.  That apparently means that all of the aforementioned Republican presidents, including the Reagan she highly praised, were traitors.<br />Who was the president who invoked criticism within Democratic ranks by welcoming Nixon back to the fold and calling regularly to solicit his advice?  That was Bill Clinton, but wait a minute, this was the same president Coulter fought to have removed from office.  How, pray tell, can he be a patriot and a vile traitor at the same time?  After all, Coulter cannot think of enough dirty names to call Clinton.<br />Then again, on the subject of Nixon, according to Joseph McCarthy's most trusted subordinate, his chief counsel to the McCarthy Committee, Roy Cohn, Nixon deserted his boss in his hour of need.  Cohn called Nixon a \\"phony,\\" the same name Goldwater used.  Something has to give here.  Pray tell, Ann, in this case who is the patriot and who is the traitor?<br />When the subject of whether or not we should declare war on Iraq was being debated, Ann was reminded by Chris Matthews that prominent Republicans, former National Security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Congressman Jack Kemp, opposed going to war.  She was quick to label both of them traitors, conservative Republicans no less, who happened to be guilty of disgreeing with Coulter.  General Norman Schwarzkopf also voiced the same misgivings.  Apparently the Commanding General of Desert Storm I is also a traitor?  How about it, Ann?<br />Oh yes, and after 9-11 Ann recommended that we bomb all the Arab nations and then, amid the rubble, convert anyone left to Christianity.  She never retracted the statement, being fired from National Review in the aftermath.  Now she has all kinds of terrible things to say about National Review.  Is National Review also part of the liberal media, cabal, Ann?  Is it a publication of traitors?<br />As for liberals, they are universally traitors.  If anyone disagrees with Ann on foreign policy or any other issue that matters to her, like the little girl in the schoolyard who sticks her tongue out, makes faces, and calls names, she will label you a traitor.<br />I have a good reason for not giving this petulant tirade of juvenile screed the 1 Star rating it deserves on the merits.  I think people should read for themselves what passes these days for conservative comment.  Hopefully some more balanced minds will surface in the future to write books about foreign policy that propose programs for action and do not rely on juvenile name calling and twisted reasoning.	2003-07-06

He substitutes factual analysis for the shrill hyperbole and uncontrollable screed unleashed by Coulter.  It should be noted that it was George W. Bush's cousin, John Ellis, who launched the wave of network projections toward his relative in the early morning following election day in November 2000.  This gave Bush the presumed look of a winner, undermining any election challenge on the part of Vice-President Gore.  This important fact, sadly, has been reported all too infrequently.  Coulter laments that it has been mentioned at all, adding this to her foolish list of left wing media preferential treatment.<br />Alterman has plenty of ammunition, and it is appropriately aimed at Coulter along with Fox Television, which absurdly promotes the claim of objectivity.  In addition to being owned by strongly rightward leaning Rupert Murdoch, Fox's news director is former Republican campaign point man for Nixon, Reagan and Bush I, Roger Ailes.  Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly run an adjunct of the Bush Communications room which is every bit as partisan as that run by White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.  O'Reilly rules as sole arbiter of the truth.  Confront him with a fact he cannot answer and you are promptly booted off the air, as evidenced by the treatment accorded articulate liberals such as Bob Fertik and Bill Hartung.  Interestingly, both Fertik and Hartung have challenged O'Reilly to debate anywhere but his own program.  There has been no response from O'Reilly, who, like Rush Limbaugh, pulls a fast plug when the going gets tough.<br />On the subject of Limbaugh, how much air time has he been provided to launch a never ending procession of half truths?  His distortions have been productively exposed by Al Franken and others.  Meanwhile he marches on and on, with nobody of a liberal stripe receiving that kind of air time to launch little more than vitriolic attacks.  Is this an example of left wing media domination?<br />Alterman's point was amply proven in the recent Iraqi War, in which, on both CNN and Fox, the emphasis was shown on restoring order while failing to focus the deadly tragedies occurring amid much uncertainty regarding the future.  The subject of civilian deaths and casualties was not addressed in the American media in the way that it was in Britain with the brilliant reportage on BBC, which informed Americans tuned to in order to find out what was really happening.<br />As Alterman concludes, the Coulter-Goldberg-O'Reilly-Hannity axis is no more than a phony ruse to con Americans into believing an absurdity while, at the same time, an effort to intimidate the media out of providing the kind of reporting that is sorely lacking, and which media forces fear will prompt a backlash of accusations claiming liberal media bias.	2003-06-29

Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles are successful strategy consultants who have cherry picked success solutions from the leading companies.<br />As you read the examples set forth which have led to dynamic economic achievements, including such shapers and movers as Microsoft, Paychex, Mandalay Resorts, Walt Disney and many others, use your imagination and listen to the experts provide winning formulas to achieve results as they exchange ideas in a creative boardroom atmosphere.  As Mitchell and Coles note, to operate a successful business during this competitive period necessitates embodying the talent of a world class chess player, the ability to think not one but many moves ahead.  Each level scaled on the competitive ladder precipitates new challenges which need to be met.  In a bygone period, notably the fifties, the old rules could often be successfully applied of building the best possible mousetrap, then play it close to the vest as  profits accelerated.  As the authors warn, following such a recipe in present circumstances can be a prompt one way ticket to extinction.<br />The key word mentioned over and over is innovation, the necessary element for continuing success.  With many companies building superior mousetraps, success often relates to who is willing to supply additional services, or create a more comfortable atmosphere for shopping.  This example is discussed in the fascinating history of Jordan's Furniture of the Boston suburb of Natick.  To entice shoppers to browse in their showrooms on Saturday evenings they began with an entertaining television advertisement spoofing &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;  When one arrived to shop the atmosphere was friendly and then some, involving a reasonably priced delicious sandwich shop and music.  In addition, sales personnel were on salary and not commission.  High pressure tactics were forbidden and customers were encouraged to browse, relax, and enjoy themselves.  As a result of following the aforementioned strategy Jordan's surged to the top in the competitive furniture field.<br />This book reminds me a great deal of those written by standard bestsellers of the success field, Napoleon Hill and Dale Carnegie.  In the manner of these popular authors, Mitchell and Coles, rather than presenting a series of dry facts in textbook fashion, humanize the fascinating world of business by providing numerous examples of how success was achieved.  Two of the most interesting human interest accounts are how a golf caddy from Pebble Beach, California and a barber with a shop next door to the Harvard University campus each obtained success through following a human interest approach, interacting successfully by exhibiting genuine personal concern for their customers.  This humanistic factor is cited repeatedly as a strong element in the successes of many large corporations and independent entrepreneurs at every level.<br />One of the most salient messages extolled in the pages of this fascinating book is the importance of teamwork.  The authors stress that by sticking together and seeing that all members of the team are fairly enriched a company is far more likely to achieve longstanding success.  It is hoped that this message will be heeded.  If it is then future horror stories such as Enron can be eliminated.	2003-06-03

Hodel was a crack homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department who, following retirement, went to work as a private detective.  Upon being presented by his father's last wife with a photo album after Dr. George Hodel's death, the former homicide detective's curiosity was enhanced by locating photographs of a face he found familiar.<br />After convincing himself that the photos were of Elizabeth Short, better known as \\"The Black Dahlia,\\" victim of the most famous unsolved murder case in L.A. Police annals, Hodel's bulldog investigative instincts went to work.  The result was the shattering conclusion that his genius father, possessor of an Einstein level IQ, was a serial killer who had brutally murdered Short as well as other victims in the Los Angeles area until his departure in 1950.  Dr. Hodel lived 40 years abroad, most of it in Manila, before returning to the U.S. toward the end of his life, dying in San Francisco.<br />A major question mark in my mind for years was how someone with unquestionable technical skills and so brutally vicious would engage in a killing such as The Black Dahlia Murder, then never strike again, as so many, including police officers, claimed.  I was also perplexed that, while Short was highly active socially while in L.A., her last week was a mystery.  The last time she was supposedly seen was leaving the Biltmore Hotel in the heart of downtown Los Angeles.  Hodel clears up those important questions.  His rigorous investigation reveals that there were many unsolved mysteries of females slain during the 1947 to 1950 period, pushing the figure well above the normal department rate in that area.  Detective Hodel links them to his father along with an accomplice, Fred Sexton,indicating that Sexton might also have been involved in the murder of Short.  He also reveals that an L.A.P.D. policewoman was confronted by an almost hysterical woman expressing fear that she was about to be killed.  In her hysteria she left her purse in the bar where she had been drinking.  The policewoman took her back after she calmed her down, then watched her exit not long thereafter with two men.<br />The foregoing points prompts one to ask just what was going on within the department at that point.  Hodel addresses that point with sad reluctance.  The L.A.P.D. he loved and faithfully served was in the midst of its second successive wave of corruption.  The first, in the late thirties and early forties, resulted in the recall of Mayor Frank Shaw and replacement by a reform judge, Fletcher Bowron.  The second wave extended into the early fifties when tough-minded William H. Parker took control.  Hodel write persuasively on the necessity of the department to keep the lid on the corruption that existed, including poor and botched investigations into homicides such as Black Dahlia and other cases.  The second wave was one of the important elements of James Ellroy's novel, \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" which was heavily rooted in fact.  Hodel may have even solved the murder of Ellroy's mother as well, showing the picture of George Sexton, who was living in the L.A. area at the time and appears to be a dead ringer for the suspected killer shown in composite drawings of the period.  Dr. Hodel was a shrewd man who knew where many police bodies were literally buried.  That is why he would remain a suspect the police were reluctant to pursue, while the District Attorney's office registered eagerness to proceed with a vigorous investigation.   <br />It is fascinating to observe a crack homicide detective in action, as one does while reading this riveting work, which I could not put down until I completed it.  Stephen Kay, the senior prosecutor in the L.A. County District Attorney's office, is convinced enough of Hodel's proposed evidence to state that he would be willing to prosecute Dr. GeorgeHodel on the basis of what his diligent son uncovered, including convincing handwriting similarities.	2003-05-08
US	52389304	R69PO8LK57KUT	0471423270	938357392	Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential	Books	5	88	100	N	N	A Man Devoid of Principle?	If Texas reporters James Moore and Wayne Slater have it right, the reasonable conclusion to reach after reading &quot;Bush's Brain&quot; is that Bush's leading adviser Karl Rove is a man who lives for political conquest and is devoid of principle.  This is not an attack piece and the writers, well grounded in the Texas political scene, use quotes from well connected political operatives and others close to the base of political operations to tell the story of how Rove rose from Lee Atwater's running mate to acquire leadership of the Young Republicans, then launched a soaring climb that resulted in his current heady position as chief political adviser and, from many accounts, top policy formulator to the nation's chief executive.  <br />The point that is frequently stressed is that Rove begins with the basic assumption that if you are a Republican you are a potential friend, barring primary competition involving a rival candidate, and if a Democrat an acknowledged enemy.  Policies are embraced as an expedient, not as an objective for governing.  A classic illustration stressed is the pressure employed by Republican Congressmen from farm belt states to change the Cuban policy supporting an embargo.  Realizing that much money can be made both ways through free and open trade, many Republicans sought change and formed a committee to achieve that goal.  Rove made a well publicized appearance at a Republican conclave and read these individuals the riot act, holding fast to the current policy.  The reason did not stem from any philosophical position Rove holds.  It relates to his belief that Bush cannot be reelected without votes from the hard Cuban right from South Florida, who oppose any dealings with Castro.  To cover his own flank he has rationalized an argument that Castro needs to be overthrown from within and that we should do nothing to intervene in that process.<br />The authors note that Rove seeks to distance himself from Richard Morris, Clinton's controversialpolitical adviser, who, along with the Democratic president, was denounced for taking positions because they were popular rather from any philosophical underpinning.  Rove seeks to create a distinction that does not really exist.  He does so through using debating skills he began honing in his high school days in Utah, which enabled him to argue any position in oratorical competitions.  It all comes down to the same as the Morris posture, since the positions are taken to coincide with policies shaped to reflect popular voter opinion.  This position is out of step with the man called the father of conservatism, Edmund Burke, who, in his legendary speech to the Electors of Bristol in the nineteenth century, proclaimed that a representative in a democratic government must shape positions he believes are best for the public, whether that same public then agrees or not.  This should be done with the full knowledge that the individual is risking defeat at the polls.  <br />While reporting the many instances of Rove opportunism, beginning with seminars delivered in his early days on dirty tricks, beckoning memories of the Nixon Era, the authors also refer repeatedly to Rove as a &quot;genius,&quot; a term they often are quoting from other sources, particularly in the political consulting field.  It should be remembered that by siding with the most consistently conservative elements of business, such as the tobacco industry, Rove is in a position to garner far more dollars under the current tragic political funding system than someone representing the polar opposite of his position, such as environmental protection, civil liberties, blue collar workers, and the impoverished.  It is no accident that Rove cast his lot with the Republicans rather than the Democrats.  Also, by having access to this much money, he is able to far more easily launch dirty tricks campaigns against political opponents.  A tragic example resulted in two sincere and innocent public servants from the Texas Agricultural Commission doing jail time as a result of being on the opposite side of the political fence from Rove.<br />The book is essential but often sad reading.  The sadness stems from appraising Rove himself.  He appears to be a solitary figure who lives for power for its own sake alone.  Based on experiences covered, including a lengthy feud with a next door neighbor, it appears that down deep there is a great void in his life and deeply rooted fears as well as, from the evidence presented, feelings of inferiority.  His overly combative nature and hunger to in his view win, even in situations that do not need to be competitive, reveal deeply rooted fears.  As in the case of Nixon, psychiatrists and psychologists would have a field day analyzing Rove.  There will no doubt be a good deal of analysis concentrated on this controversial figure as long as he remains on the public stage.	2003-04-13

It will not win the support of the corporate controllers who buy time and form conglomerates so that courageous stories like this will not be told, but in today's topsy turvy world, where control is amassed by every smaller numbers of greedy multinationals, this is a story that needs to be revealed in every shocking detail.<br />The author takes this account of appalling corporate greed to the level where it must go if the true story is to be revealed,  to the linkage between large corporations and the huge international drug network.  This is in turn linked to the oil network, and it in turn is attached to the warmaking machine with the chilling potential to amass fortunes by sending youngsters choked off from good jobs by greedy corporate globalism to do their fighting.  Chicken hawks like Bush, Cheney, Wolfowitz and Perle cheer from the sidelines as these youngsters are sacrificed on an altar of corporate greed.  <br />The CIA is not spared by this courageous author.  In many instances it has been used to soften up economies before replacing leaders who demand a fair share of the pie for the people of their respective nations.  In other times the influence is more direct, as in overthrowing democratically elected governments in Guatemala, Iran and Chile.  Meanwhile the propaganda machine spiels off the message that people hate America because it is such a rich nation with prosperous and happy people.  Try telling that to those who have been reduced to fragmentary existences through the oppressive yoke of globalization.  Look into what happened in Russia after the old Communist bosses were overthrown.  <br />The Enron picture is tied ever so closely to the Bush regime.  While Cheney warned us that California was being torn asunder due to a lack of sufficient energy resources, the truth finally came out in a stinging government report revealing what informed sources already knew, that a savage ripoff led by the Enron brigade had fleeced California's taxpayers.  Why not let these evil wrongdoers do the hard time in federal prisons rather than non-violent drug offenders who need treatment rather than prison incarceration?<br />These are just some of the questions arising from a detailed reading of this brilliant book.  We need more courageous authors like this who are not afraid to take on the establishment.  This kind of courage is what is needed to turn things around amid suffocating greed at the corporate international level.  Perhaps enough courageous voices can ultimately end the tragic concept, which former President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned emphatically against, of preventive war.	2003-04-05

Books	5	33	49	N	N	An Important Viewpoint	With a controlled corporate media which is becoming increasingly better known for what it dodges than what it discusses, this book is a priceless gem.  It reveals just what it is about America which angers others, often to the point of hate.<br />The book addresses the frequently expressed American air of superiority.  It begins by mentioning that a putatively liberal program, \\"West Wing\\", took the post 9-11 posture that 1) Arab terrorists are people who generally fail, and 2) America is a nation that fastidiously succeeds.  This is an overly simplistic caricature rather than a serious analysis of cultural differences between America and other nations, including Arab countries.<br />The authors point out that America is becoming increasingly resented by its domination on the world market and, at the same time, an unceasing campaign to take America to other lands.  Reciprocal exchange is one thing, but increasingly other cities in foreign lands are becoming imitations of American suburbia.  Resistance to this has been recently evidenced by French protests against the American fast food giant, McDonald's.  <br />A point is made in connection with the currently successful American television program \\"Alias\\" concerning the conformity America is imposing through the marketplace and in the media.  While the heroine of the program globe trots with energetic frequency, the international sites she visits represent no more than copies of American cities.<br />There is much written about the influence of globalization and the horrendous influence of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  Too often American-dominated global banks have placed other nations in suffocating strangleholds.  Argentina and Turkey are current examples.  After placing these nations in an economic bind, American authorities then impose privatization on helpless masses who become poorer as they are ground down by the weight of economic oppression.<br />This is a great book for those willingto read about a vital topic lucidly presented by highly informed writers.  For those locked into the \\"Blame America first\\" mode of thought suffocation, Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter are infinitely preferred.	2003-03-05

It is eerie to think of the world being carved up by select global geopolitical thinkers, political leaders and corporate giants.  Here is a book with basic premises which one can strongly disagree, but still regard it as indispensable, hence the 5-star review I have provided while finding so much of the message conveyed as abhorrent to democratic principles.<br />The author, it will be remembered, was the architect of President Carter's policy of aiding rebels opposing the Soviet friendly regime in Afghanistan in 1979.  As National Security Adviser, the Polish expatriate believed that the ingredients were present to help establish a Russian Vietnam.  With the aid of Stinger missiles and subsequent strong support from the Reagan Administration in the eighties the Russians were defeated.  One can see in retrospect, however, why the Soviet leadership opposed the creation of a dangerously extremist Islamic fundamentalist regime on its border.  None other than Osama Bin Laden was used as a CIA operative assting this profound change, which resulted ultimately in the Taliban, oppression, and continuing conflict.  In retrospect, this American move was anything but a brilliant initiative.<br />The most shocking part of this book is the author's blunt statement that what the U.S. truly needs to awaken public opinion and lead to the kind of initiative to seize control of oil rich territory he deems necessary is a calamitous attack on the order of a Pearl Harbor.  This came about with 9-11, which occurred after this book was published.  <br />For many years spokespersons of the left and right were derided for a panic mentality and in some instances paranoia for daring to impart the conspiracy element into world politics.  The author is a definitive insider connected to the Council on Foreign Relations.  The statements made in this book corroborate conspiracy fears as the world is approached and analyzed with scant disregard for the citizenry with astrong emphasis on the planners, the global activists who are prepared to move on the scene and determine the future.  These individuals do not appear to be concerned about listening to public opinion, but are concerned about shaping it to fit their pre-conceived images of global necessity.	2003-02-24

For those of you who fantasized about what it would be like coaching an NFL team, Bill Parcells aided by Will McDonough offer the opportunity to find out what it is like.<br />Parcells takes readers through his entire final season with the New York Jets in 1999, when he ultimately concluded that this would be his final coaching responsibility.  Jerry Jones has since hastened Parcells out of retirement at a hefty salary to jumpstart the formerly mighty Dallas Cowboys as he had earlier altered the fortunes of the New York Giants, New England Patriots and Jets respectively.<br />You cannot help coming away with an admiration for Parcells due to his rock-ribbed honesty.  Here is a man who will criticize his players if he believes they are giving less than 100% or playing less than intelligent football.  He blames himself for losing a game in the closing stages by &quot;getting cute&quot; and calling for a pass which was intercepted and ultimately cost his team the game when it would have been wiser retrospectively to keep the ball on the ground.  When assistant coach Dan Henning tells him that his insistence on keeping Rick Mirer in the lineup as starting quarterback in the face of less than awesome performances stemmed from a stubbornness to face the facts since Parcells made the trade in his general manager's capacity, the coach, rather than blowing up over having his ego assaulted in the manner that a smaller man would, ends up agreeing with Henning.  Accepting genuinely felt constructive criticism in a positive manner is the hallmark of a mature and honest man.<br />In addition to telling us plenty about strategy, how games were won and lost, and providing his opinions on players he reveres, such as his own sterling running back Curtis Martin and respected opposing quarterback Dan Marino of the Dolphins, Parcells tells about the deeply rooted pressures in NFL coaching.  He reveals about his bypass operation and expresses dismay over his inability to sleep and nervous eating anxieties when the season is in full swing, leading to weight gain.  He also weighs in on his view of the poor performance of certain NFL officials, especially in key situations, a problem which has magnified since this book appeared.  Parcells expresses his concern as well over the rise of fan hooliganism, fearing that perhaps America may follow the example ultimately of the European soccer rioters.<br />If you love pro football, this is a can't miss read.  The coach is an intelligent man of candor with plenty of interesting things to say.	2003-02-22

If it walks like a conspiracy, talks like a conspiracy, and acts like a conspiracy, it is very possible that we might have a conspiracy.  The apologists of the status quo, particularly the Bushies and the corporate establishment to which they are beholden, seek to ridicule books like this and say they are all part of an absurd conspiracy syndrome.  What they fervently hope is that you will not dare read them.  Had enough Americans read this sizzler it is entirely possible that Bush Junior's forces may not have been close enough on election night to remain within stealing distance of the presidential election, finally achieved through the legal prostitution of Federal Society cronies, including one subservient Uncle Tom with a penchant for Rush Limbaugh, namely Clarence Thomas.<br />When you read this book you wonder long and hard about whether this was really such an unfortunate coincidence that Bush Sr. in his mudslinging 1988 campaign had ardent Nazis working in his minorities division.  It was only when Congressman Stephen Solarz and others sniffed the foul odor and rose up in indignation that the elder Bush expressed dismay and dismissed the miscreants, expressing shock in the process.<br />Just rewind from 1988 to Tarpley's analysis of how the Bush family got rolling in the banking business, with juicy contracts with the Nazis and strengthening of the Third Reich war machine through loans and subsequent sales for pig iron.  Then there was that strange society that still remains, and which Poppy and Junior both belonged to at Yale, along with William F. Buckley Jr., \\"Skull and Bones.\\"  Just a few harmless fraternity pranksters?  I doubt it.  Check out the records of the members through the years and observe all the hellish havoc they have reeked on America and throughout various portions of the world.  It all happened by accident?  Hardly.  Yes, well, it might actually be a conspiracy!  But conspiracies don't exist.  Ask any loyal Bushie.<br />This book has become an underground classic and rightfully so.  Its author knows literally where certain bodies are buried vis-a-vis the Bush clan and is not afraid to reveal the facts.  Thank God there are a few people out there like Tapley who will not be intimidated and continue to speak the truth no matter what the potential consequences might be.	2003-02-15

Clearly Vidal feels that it is being plundered maliciously by the corporate sector, which controls the political sector, and provides numerous details to support his position.<br />Vidal was frequently denounced, even in contemporary legal circles, for being an isolationist.  The criticism was that, given Vidal's posture, a series of Hitlers would be permitted to run rampant within society.  Vidal's position is not isolationist, but rather an understanding of a system wherein manipulation is ruthlessly practiced on an international scale to bring into being purported emergencies that required military responses, in the words of Lady Thatcher's famous \\"aggression cannot be allowed to stand\\" maxim.  What needs to be done, and Vidal and others such as Antony Sutton, Noam Chomsky and Mike Ruppert are currently doing it, to name three specific examples, is to unravel what transpired prior to the rush to war.  For instance, the grandfather of our current president, banker Prescott Bush, provided funds which helped warrior Hitler keep his pig iron supply up to date.  We also know about Reagan,Bush, Thatcher and the buildup of Saddam Hussein, along with the generous CIA assistance in bringing him to power.  To get to the roots of these conflicts and to expose them is not isolationism, it is a pursuit of the truth with a design to save lives and fight corporate tyranny since ruthless profiteers ultimately garner the booty secured from military adventures.  Vidal hits on many of the same cogent points regarding 9-11 made by Nafeez Moseddeq Ahmed in \\"The War on Freedom.\\"<br />Vidal makes a bold call for a new constitutional convention.  He sees this as a possible prescription for American citizens to regain control of a nation being suffocated by the corporate hierarchy, as Vidal has frequently noted, the one-half of one percent actually ruling America.	2003-02-04

Maraniss traces Lombardi's roots as a butcher's son growing up in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn.  His passion for football exceeds his on field talent, but through grit and determination Lombardi obtained a scholarship to Fordham University in the Bronx and became one of the \\"Seven Blocks of Granite\\" at guard, helping bolster the line offensively and defensively.  His innate coaching gifts were on display early as, according to Maraniss the least talented of his teammates on the Fordham line, he became the most inspirational.  More talented teammates would listen to his criticism and react to his fiery exhortations to push onward toward perfection.<br />The Fordham school motto was \\"do or die\\" and Lombardi profited from the teachings of the Jesuit fathers at Fordham, instilling discipline within him and a sense of commitment.  After coaching football and basketball at St. Cecilia's High School in Englewood, New Jersey, Lombardi then received an opportunity to become line coach at Army, where he sopped up gridiron knowledge from one of the game's all-time coaching masters, Colonel Earl \\"Red\\" Blaik.  At Army he also became acquainted with General Douglas MacArthur, whose motto of \\"There is no substitute for victory\\" remained within him from that time thereafter, as did the Army motto of \\"God, honor and country.\\"  <br />Eventually Lombardi moved on to become offensive coordinator under Jim Lee Howell with the New York Giants.  Another young up and coming coach, Tom Landry, assumed the defensive coordinator's role, comprising with Lombardi the most formidable one-two punch among assistants in National Football League history.<br />While Landry became famous by becoming the original coach of the expansion Dallas Cowboys, guiding them to greatness, Lombardi received first crack one year earlier in 1959 in an NFL head coaching status, becoming mentor of the hapless Green Bay Packers, thought by many to be on their way out of the NFL.  In 1958, under Scooter McLean, the Packers were 1-10-1.  The tenacious Lombardi brought his determined ways immediately to bear, finishing 7-5 in his astounding first season, then losing by an eyelash to the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFL championship game one year later.  Not to be thwarted, in 1961 Lombardi won it all, romping at home over his old New York Giants' team in a 37-0 rout, then repeating the victory feat one year later in Yankee Stadium 16-7.<br />Green Bay was a small town consisting of uncomplicated people adhering to the traditional values.  Lombardi was a no nonsense coach who disdained fancy formations and trick plays, focusing his attention on perfecting the basics, emphasizing execution.  <br />This is a book that could be read and enjoyed by those interested in solid biography and not in football, and will be devoured by afficianados.  Lombardi is presented in human terms, revealing him as someone with his own troubles.  His devotion to his teams left less time at home than he would have desired.  He fought with wife Marie often and struggled to find more time to spend with son Vince Jr. and daughter Susan.  His relations with management and with the press were often less than cordial, and yet, in the final analysis, despite his imperfections, Lombardi emerges as a loving, caring individual to players, family and friends.  He emerges as a giant, an overachiever determined to come as close as humanly possible to attaining perfection in his field, obtaining the maximal effort from his players.	2003-02-02

If they will cool off and read it they will learn something from it.  Another reason to read it is that the book's leading figure is someone who could scarcely be extracted from even the the craftiest fiction in that it is doubtful that anyone could ever dream up Robert Hanssen and his many bizarre mind turns.<br />Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky probed the depths of madness and bizarre personality traits in their novels, and by doing his research and taking on Hanssen as he actually exists, this work falls into an intriguingly comparable category.  Consider the fact that Hanssen, a devout Catholic who converted from Lutheranism after meeting his wife to be, was a member of the conservative Catholic lay group Opus Dei, of which he remained a member while he betrayed his country.  Consider that this bizarre and tricky Svengali convinced his wife that he had given up spying after confessing his crime to a priest, who told him to cease his efforts and donate his profits obtained from the Russians for his acts of betrayal to Mother Theresa.  It was not until he was finally caught that his wife realized that he had failed to follow the priest's instruction and had continued his life as a spy.<br />The Hanssen duplicity extended into the sexual realm, and with a twist reflective of the split personality involved.  Hanssen became infatuated with a sexually alluring dancer at a strip club visited by FBI agents and members of the Washington intelligence establishment.  He bought her a used Mercedes and took her on a trip to Hong Kong.  To her total astonishment and acute frustration, he refused to consummate a sexual act with her despite her best efforts.  Despite his fascination with her, the Opus Dei Catholic side remained.<br />A fascinating aspect of the book revolves around how Hanssen got away with his spying for better than twodecades.  Wise points out that he was aided by the fact that his own FBI colleagues believed that their esprit de corps discipline was so strong and loyalties so unflinching that one of their own would never stoop to such treachery.  They strongly believed that the treason stemmed from someone in the CIA.  One loyal CIA operative had his entire life disrupted and his career destroyed when he was thought to be the traitor giving secrets to the Soviet KGB.<br />This is one of those crackling page turners that takes hold of the reader early and carries him or her with the forceful energy of a bucking bronco to the final page.	2003-02-02

There are plenty of smoking guns and the author was not seeking to prove a case.  He has supplied an abundance of information which vitally needs to be taken to the next level, that of a meticulous independent investigation.<br />Some of the troubling points raised which so many find intolerable to confront that they seek to avoid their implications altogether are:<br />1)  The many warnings received by the FBI and other agencies of the U.S. Government, including from Israel's Mossad.  While many media sources decried as paranoiac the claim from Arab nations that Israelis stayed away from the World Trade Center on 9-11, it has been documented that the Mossad warned Washington and that a business half-owned by the Mossad terminated its lease before the attack, apparently aware that it was forthcoming based on the same warnings U.S. Government sources spurned.<br />2)  The tremendous profits earned through put options based on huge drops in American and United airline stocks as of September 11.  This option windfall was totally unprecedented in Wall Street annals and almost certainly had to be predetermined based on advance knowledge.  No other plausible explanation suffices.<br />3)  The report in European sources beginning with Paris newspaper Le Figaro, owned ironically by the controversial Carlyle Group, that the former head of ISI, the Pakistani intelligence agency, provided the lead September 11 skyjacker Atta with $100,000.  The former ISI head quietly resigned after 9-11 and nothing has been said about including him and this incident in any foregoing investigation of 9-11.<br />4)  Links between the intelligence establishment and the terrorist skyjackers, as well as the two mysterious flight training schools in Venice, Florida run by Dutch nationals, one of whom received sponsorship support from none other than Catherine Harris.<br />5)  The fact that, contrary to FAA guidelines, the planes which crashed into the Pentagon and in a Pennslyvania field were not scrambled.  This routine measure was undertaken in the case of golfer Payne Stewart when his plane encountered difficulties, but not in the case of the post-World Trade Center terrorist destruction.  Cheney lied on the record when he reported, \\"This was the president's call.\\"  It is a pro forma call based on FAA regulations.<br />6)  U.S. Government archival evidence that an invasion of Afghanistan had been planned as far in advance of 9-11 as 1997, a point which needs to be carefully explored.<br />These are some of the points made, and which need to be addressed by an independent investigator.  The Bush Administration telegraphed its intentions by selecting initially definitive international dealmaker and Carlyle Group operative Henry Kissinger to head the official government 9-11 investigation.  The current chairman, Tom Kean, is a former New Jersey governor with ties to the oil industry.	2003-01-15

I am also delighted to see a book about some of the great and often unheralded teams of the old Catholic Conference of California.  <br />My cousin Fran Hare played three times against USF, including the brilliant 1951 squad led by the running heroics of the incomparable Ollie Matson and the defensive excellence of Gino Marchetti and Bob St. Clair.  Fran's older brother, the late Vern Hare, was on the 1948 Santa Clara team which upset Oklahoma in 1948.  He was a teammate of the great Hall of Fame end Tom Fears, who played both at Santa Clara and UCLA.  <br />When I lived in Los Angeles and was a sports editor I talked to all kinds of people associated with Loyola football, a school which put on the field stellar future pros such as Gene Brito, Skippy Gincanelli and Don Klosterman.  Loyola had a great team in 1950 which lost only one game, a 28-26 upset at home in Gilmore Stadium against Santa Clara.<br />Yes, and there was also St. Mary's located in the San Francisco suburb of Moraga.  In the thirties the Gaels had one of the nation's premier football coaches in Slip Madigan.  In perhaps the school's finest gridiron hour, the Gaels defeated USC in 1931 at the L.A. Coliseum, 13-7, the only blemish on Howard Jones's team's record as the Trojans recovered from that reversal to win the national title with what historians called one of the premier college teams of the early era.<br />The competition was intense and many of the players from these schools went on to National Football League glory.  What galled a lot of us was that many of these players and their schools failed to receive the national credit they deserved.  This fine book detailing a superb team from a richly endowed grid era corrects that aforementioned deficiency.  Therecognition is highly deserved!	2002-12-31

It was first published in Italy and became a runaway bestseller there, where Vidal currently resides, as well as throughout the rest of Europe.  Finally it was published in America, quickly scaling the bestseller charts here as well.<br />Vidal asks the kind of unpleasant but necessary questions which need to be posed in a democracy, and are all too often stifled, as in the case of not initially being published in America despite his lengthy career of writing success.  Vidal refers to the Bush Administration as \\"America's Ruling Junta\\" and points out that roughly one percent of the people are currently represented as part of that elite.  <br />Foremost on Vidal's mind is the subject of why America is currently hated and the rationale behind current attacks as manifested by the Oklahoma City bombing and 9-11.  Vidal's anti-establishment writing attracted notice from none other than Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and a correspondence ensued.  Vidal vehemently denies that he ever deemed McVeigh's actions justifiable.  He maintained a vigilant stance on attempting to determine what motivated McVeigh to pursue such a vicious anti-establishment course against the United States.  He also seeks answers to nagging questions that McVeigh, according to scientific experts, could not have carried out his vendetta on his own.  He publishes a letter he wrote to incoming FBI Director Robert Mueller concerning nagging doubts that need to be explored, noting that he never received a response.<br />Vidal also focuses on the international drug scene.  Declaring the current policy a failure, he recommends making drugs available at cost in an effort to treat the disease as a medical rather than criminal problem while at the same time undercutting the vast profits incurred from underground drug networks.<br />The muckraking journalist also tackles the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents.In each case he finds that government authority was excercised at excessive levels and careful scrutiny is warranted.  He laments that efforts to probe these cases meet with stern resistance.  Vidal clearly feels that from the Grassy Knoll and the JFK assassination to the present, the intelligence establishment of what he terms America's Ruling Junta has stood in the way of progress and ultimate truth.	2002-12-22

This legal fiction was compounded into soaring advantages for corporate status which rankled those of us concerned about fairness in the overall legal picture. <br />Thom Hartmann's groundbreaking work \\"Unequal Protection\\" explains how corporations came to achieve their hugely advantageous currently status in a society where President George W. Bush is referred to as \\"America's CEO.\\"  Hartmann begins his study with the American Revolution and its roots as a tax revolt against the inequality rendered against the native population by England.  Much of this injustice was manifested by the international British monopoly, the East India Company, which destroyed indigenous competition within America in the important tea making industry.  Usurious tax rates were levied on American companies, while the East India Company prevailed.  Two forces emerged in the American economic picture after freedom was achieved, that of the pro-competition, corporate-limiting element led by Thomas Jefferson and the Federalist, corporate protectionists spearheaded by John Adams.<br />While the corporate side was thwarted by the popular grassroots movement of Andrew Jackson, who ended the monopolistic United States Bank, the monopolists struck back in the era of the Robber Barons of the nineteenth century.  A little known decision with strong future implications was handed down in the landmark 1886 U.S. Supreme Court case of Santa Clara County vs. Union Pacific Railroad.  While never a part of the court's holding, the concept of the corporation as a person was insidiously worked into the headnotes of the opinion.  From that point the concept was treated as revered doctrine by corporate lawyers seeking advantage.<br />The fundamental irony arising from the Santa Clara County case was that the FourteenthAmendment of equal protection, presented to provide former slaves with freedom under the Constitution, was perversely twisted to provide corporate America with advantages over the common citizenry.  Time and again courts would rule against the interests of taxpayers while providing corporations with huge advantages.  We are currently seeing the results of such inequities as the gap being the richest and poorest elements of society widens, with the middle class squeezed in between.<br />Hartmann calls for effective grass roots action, encouraging citizens to begin at the local level to evoke a needed change in corporate status.  Ordinance changes will hopefully snowball a ripple effect whereby a constitutional amendment will be adopted ending the destructive controversy once and for all and eliminating the advantages achieved by corporations masquerading as persons.  The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was written and intended for the protection of citizens, not expansive corporations wielding gigantic economic claws.	2002-12-16

Cornwell, an author with previous crime lab experience who has gained fame and fortune with best selling novels about the exploits of forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta, provides potential DNA evidence to be used against Sickert to link him to the grisly Jack the Ripper murders, but as critics have noted, it is far from conclusive.  Two important factors need to be remembered, 1) scores of letters purporting to have come from Jack the Ripper were received and reviewed by police, with most dismissed as coming from cranks; 2) Sickert was cremated, rendering the prospect of any conclusive DNA finding linking him to the killings virtually inconceivable.<br />The book has merit, however, on several fronts, just as long as one is circumspect about drawing too much on sometimes fragmentary conclusions concerning Sickert.  Victorian England is revealed in fascinating detail, along with the shadowy world of London's East End, Whitechapel, where the Jack the Ripper murders occurred.  Sickert is a fascinating figure, with his bizarre artistic genius and ability to hobnob with leading figures of late nineteenth century London.  He was the apprentice of the legendary Boston expatriate who took London society by storm and remained to prosper, artist, journalist and bon vivant James McNeill Whistler.  <br />While Sickert's artistic tastes revealed ghoulishness, the desire to paint luckless prostitutes with their hapless customers, it is understandable that he might draw attention as a potential Ripper possibility.  He also was known to take walks in the dangerous Whitechapel area in late evenings.  These are attention drawing elements, and perhaps render one a suspect, but it takes much more to pin the crimes on Sickert and establish that he indeed was the Ripper.  <br />Due to the fact that so much time has elapsed since the murders were committed over a century ago, it is understandable that interest abounds with a number of prospects being considered.  It is also understandable, and indeed likely, that after all the time that has elapsed that speculation will continue to abound without the Jack the Ripper mystery ever being solved.	2002-12-14

Had it not been for the fact that young Paul had left his room and the video game he and a fellow Air Force friend were playing to visit a nearby rest room, he would have been killed instantly, as was his pal.<br />Young Blais lay in a coma for a time, and his father, due to the inability of Air Force personnel to properly identify him, for a time believed he had been killed in the terrorist bombing.  When the elder Blais attended a memorial service for the Khobar Towers victims he was able to empathize as a parent who,until young Paul was finally identified, believed that he too had been deprived of a son.<br />A notable element of this compelling account is the manner in which the author, despite trauma and sorrow, is able to put his  emotions behind him and focus on the issue at hand, providing young Paul with all the love and support necessary to surmount a tragedy and helped propel him toward recovery.  Paul was a young man with a penchant for vigorous athletic activity and a preference for water sports.  As a result, starting from scratch, learning to walk and talk anew, at one point propels young Paul into suicidal depression.  The unwavering support of a loving father, his mother Maria, Paul's ex-wife, along with  two supportive step parents, help turn things dramatically around.  The elder Paul is delighted to participate in his son's graduation from flight school.<br />The story contains an interesting surprise twist at the end, with the elder Paul being prouder than ever of the progress his son has made.  The ultimate triumph demonstrates the results of a solid game plan built around faith and love, two cornerstones Blais emphasizes repeatedly in this moving work.<br />Blais also focuses on the important element of feeling for others, which he believes enhances human stature on an individual and extended basis.  He states with resolute conviction that people throughout the world need to be more aware of and empathize with each other's tragedies, whether the victims of terrorism be in America, the Middle East, Europe or Africa.	2002-12-14

Whereas Bush along with Rumsfeld and a team of advisers all notable for failing to serve in Vietnam arouse sentiment toward war, Hiro calmly and persuasively provides an alternative view replete with historical examples concerning Iraq's complex history.<br />In the fashion of many international scholars, as well as American activists such as Ramsey Clark and Noam Chomsky, Hiro points out the inherent dangers of attacking Iraq to supplant the leadership of ruthless strongman Saddam Hussein.  The important issue he constantly raises is the disruption of any semblance of stability throughout the Middle East.  Anti-Americanism cannot help but rise to precipitous levels in view of both our past and current policies toward Iraq.  Some one million lives of innocent citizens have been lost as a result of sanctions against Iraq.  <br />In examining past policies toward Iraq Hiro squarely confronts the double standard question.  While Bush's father as Commander and Chief of the U.S. during the 1991 Gulf War referred to Saddam Hussein at one point as worse than Adolf Hitler, Bush had previously sent an array of weapons there, including the components of chemical weaponry used against Iran in another terrible application of the infamous \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\\" syndrome.  So Saddam jumped from ally of sorts status to worse than Hitler!  This occurred after the Middle East oil supply was jeopardized, certainly no coincidence.<br />What is currently needed during this potentially turbulent period for the entire world is cool and sober reflection on the consequences of military action and analysis of Iraq's history.  Hiro thankfully takes this necessary approach, which enhances understanding of the broad picture.	2002-12-13
US	52389304	R3NZEBZO0IG2I0	1583224890	746847725	9-11	Books	5	70	89	N	N	Controversy or Common Sense?	I was particularly anxious to read this book after observing the controversy pertaining to it.  An iconoclastic leftist journalist-author attacked Chomsky for softness toward what he termed Islamic terrorist fascism, contending that the MIT linguist was in a sense apologizing for 9-11 by contending that it occurred as a result of U.S. policies.<br />Chomsky begins by pointing out that 9-11 placed America, for the first time, in the same position it was in 1812, when it last faced a direct attack from an enemy force on its own shores.  In the earlier instance the invading force was the British army.  He then makes a prescient point, delivering a fervent hope that the U.S. would not fall into the trap of responding with such overwhelming military force that the minions of Ossama bin Laden would derive a propaganda benefit.  Regrettably the response was not as precisely targeted as should have been the case.  Whereas 3,000 lives were lost as a result of 9-11, some 3,500 Afghan peasants died during the American bombing campaign.  In addition, many other Afghans flooded the Pakistan border in the wake of the firepower, creating a refugee tragedy as the number soared to one million.<br />Chomsky also mentions the tragic element of blowback, in this instance relating directly to bin Laden.  Following the dangerous doctrine of \\"The enemy of my enemy is my friend,\\" the United States initially under Jimmy Carter and later, with great gusto, under Ronald Reagan, provided Afghan rebels with stinger missiles, which led to shooting down Russian planes, which ultimately led to the moderate Soviet-backed regime being supplanted by Islamic extremist forces, and finally the Taliban.  Bin Laden was vigorously involved in that campaign as a field commander and was aided directly by the CIA.  Would it not have been better to stay out of the conflict?  Was a Russian-supported government not infinitely better than the fiery dragon which ultimately emerged?<br />Chomsky constantly hits thenote that what is needed to defeat murderous terrorism is international cooperation, pointing to the cowboy antics in Nicaragua where, amid death squads, drugs, and runaway CIA activity, President Reagan referred to the murdering Contras as \\"the moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers.\\"	2002-11-20

Who could forget his tip-toe excursion into former CIA director William Casey's hospital room as he stood at death's door, seeking confirmation of his knowledge of the Iran-Contra initiative.<br />Woodward spirited to fame and millionaire status along with fellow Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein with \\"All the President's Men,\\" the inside story on the Watergate burglary and what transpired in its wake, a brilliant expose of the Nixon White House which resulted in Pulitzer Prizes for both journalists.  They returned to the same Nixon White House scene to pen \\"The Final Days\\", detailing how the sad saga of the Nixon Administration Watergate finally played out.  <br />Woodward's current effort takes up in many ways where \\"The Commanders\\" left off, the story of the Gulf War and the strategy of the White House of George H.W. Bush.  Some of the most fascinating passages related to the conflict between General Norman Schwarzkopf and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Colin Powell on whether or not the U.S. should send troops into Iraq to destroy the regime of Saddam Hussein.  Powell held the line for Bush in explaining that the UN mandate for action did not encompass such an initiative.<br />Now we are back in the same area as Bush's son seeks to undermine Saddam Hussein through threatening U.S. military action unless weapons of destruction which Bush asserts he possesses are ultimately destroyed.  Powell, now in the position of Secretary of State, has been urging an international approach through the United Nations Security Council.  Woodward points out that Powell was ultimately joined in that regard by National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice, who also stressed the international approach.<br />Woodward writes much about the Afghanistan campaign and how the U.S. supplied $70 million in cash on the barrelhead to seek assistance within that nation to repel terrorism.  He frankly concludes that the answeris far from known and that one needs to stay tuned for evolving developments.	2002-11-20

His \\"Theater of War\\" sounds an alarm against draconian measures such as the Patriot Act with its suffocating Orwellian overtones.  In the aftermath of 9-11, when 3,000 lives of Americans were tragically lost, the U.S. government launched bombing assaults in Afghanistan which left 3,500 Afghan peasants dead.  Lewis Lapham is the kind of American who mourns the deaths of the Afghan peasants as well as those lives tragically lost in 9-11.  He seeks to get a fix on a runaway presidency in which pre-emptive strikes are offered as a policy option, all too often ignoring the consequences of such a posture internationally.  It is time to reassess our policy priorities and Lapham's is a dissenting voice providing constructive input into that vital arena.<br />Lapham recognizes, and stresses repeatedly, the need for examining the ultimate consequences of today's actions.  The peasants who die in a foreign land must be remembered today.    The impoverished who remain alive need positive reinforcement, as the Good Neighbor Policy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Alliance for Progress of John F. Kennedy provided.  The rhetoric needs to be cooled, discussion needs to prevail over aggression, and purposeful policy positions addressing the issues of international conflict as well as poverty need to be advanced with a clear voice.  As Lapham asserts, a Big Stick policy will only backfire in the long run as America becomes increasingly hated.  He suggests a much better road to travel.	2002-10-22

By using the framework of a novel in place of a non-fiction work of historical journalism he is able to carve a personal sketch of a fascinating, articulate young professional seeking the truth, aware of his past roots and realizing how they both enhance and impede that journey.<br />Malek Adle is a public prosecutor in Beirut whose search for truth and meaning are enhanced by two events imploding at a critical juncture.  The novel operates on twin tiers, as a mystery thriller in which the young prosecutor, working his first murder case, becomes involved in a turbulence of activity extending beyond Lebanon to Dallas,Texas, and on a second level as a love story.  During this same pivotal period Malek in a poetry class meets Adinah Fink, a sensuous, beautiful Jewish woman with American roots.<br />Ghraizi's plot spin reveals the truism that, as one looks outwardly for answers, such explorations ultimately turn the seeker inwardly.  Such was the case with Malek, whose exploration for answers in his murder investigation leads him back to his own Arab roots and his intrinsic beliefs.  The same holds true as his relationship with Adinah intensifies.  A well educated man who was trained in the Christian religion but has become a no nonsense, pragmatic agnostic, Malek in time begins to consider the necessity for God, as well as to explore Arab-Jewish relations in new ways, constantly admiring both the unruffled candor and intellect of the beautiful Adinah.  It is plain that Malek, a sober-minded man with a penchant for reading as well as a shared interest with Adinah in poetry, is enchanted with the Jewish woman as much for her keen intellect as he admires her compelling beauty.  <br />The two-tiered irony of Ghraizi'swork is that he looks inwardly and finds answers concerning his own life through his dual pursuits of unlocking the mysteries behind a murder investigation and exploring fully his romantic relationship with the always fascinating Adinah. His life experiences dovetail to enhance his pursuit of truth as an Arab intellectual.<br />This work is of vital significance today in that it reveals the thinking of a sensitive Arab intellectual seeking to come to grips with the complexities of the modern Middle East.  What makes Malek such an interesting figure is that his beliefs are not embedded in cement.  Malek Adle is willing to change his views, but only after a thorough investigation of the issues involved propel him in such a direction, a shrewd and determined pragmatist with an investigator's zeal.	2002-10-18

He began by working for Ralph Nader and eventually became New York City's commissioner of consumer affairs.  He became more intimately connected than ever to the dangers posed to democracy by the influence of big money when he ran as the Democratic Party's candidate in the last New York mayoral election against multimillionaire Michael Bloomberg.  The amount of money spent on both sides was staggering, prompting Green to pick up his talented pen and write this tome dedicated to awakening citizens to the dangers of a democracy perilously close to drowning in a cesspool of excessive funds.<br />Whereas America's founding fathers provided the nation's fledgling government with a system of checks and balances, in current times one can forget about the balances and concentrate fully on the checks.  Checks and more checks are forthcoming from big interests, which translates into ultimate control, no matter how often this axiomatic truth is denied.  As critics ask:  If the strategy is not succeeding, why do the big money interests shower accelerating amounts on political campaigns?<br />The cancer on our democracy is abundantly clear to those interested citizens watching election battles in the current 2002 mid-term campaign.  Rather than stepping forward and debating the merits of the major issues facing the nation, an increasingly helpless and turned off citizenry is bombarded by simplistic campaign negative ads highlighting half truths and sometimes outright lies.  Post election studies reveal that excessive negative advertising disgusts many voters, who then become so turned off by the process that they do not vote at all.  This was symbolized in the 1988 presidential election when George Bush the Elder prevailed on a highly orchestrated campaign of negative advertising highlighted by Willie Horton and the Pledge of Allegiance.  Less than half of all eligible voters bothered to go to thepolls, an all-time high since such scientific studies began to measure voting tendencies.<br />This cancer on the body politic has been a festering wound for some time.  A few years ago in California an election campaign specialist with an imposing track record for success proclaimed bluntly that when a candidate hired his services it was time for him or her to take a vacation.  He did not want the candidate to get in the way as he put his big money campaign into gear, highlighted by advertising displays of catchy symbols and pithy comments, which were drummed ad nauseum into the minds of voters through television and radio.<br />Mark Green made a recent appearance on the Phil Donahue Show in which he made a dire prediction.  If this cancer is not dissipated through corrective legislation very soon then we will reach the point where the only two types of candidates are independently wealthy moguls ready, willing and able to spend millions of their own dollars such as a Michael Bloomberg, or lackeys under the total control of the wealthy special interests bankrolling their campaign efforts.<br />Mark Green's is an important voice which needs to be heard.  The voice is tuned into the major area that will make or break democracy as we have known it.  Will the days of idealistic but far from wealthy candidates be truly a thing of the past?  Will Jeffersonian town hall democracy be something the smooth talking kingmakers will dismiss with sarcastic laughter as relics from a truly distant past?	2002-10-17

Directly at the heart is the popularity of a word and concept sweeping certain elements of corporate America, that of the permatemp.  What can be better than making overworked people logging long hours at small pay scales temporary rather than permanent workers?  The Wal-Mart folks fired up all cylinders and proceeded full speed ahead!  The era of the temporary worker has arrived, uncluttering all kinds of potentially messy details such as employee benefits.  Health care?  Sick leave?  Remember, you're a temp and what is so nice is there is no meddlesome union standing in the way.  Now we have a direct one-on-one \\"bargaining position.\\"  Guess who has top standing?<br />Americans have never been as overweight as they are today, and here the logo culture has played a major role.  The corporate sponsors have not only indoctrinated adults, they are working franctically on the younger generation.  They have marched into the schools and replaced all that presumably wimpish fare such as fruit juices and salads with the really hip and macho food and drink.  Let's pony up with more soft drinks and hamburgers, then wonder why the kiddies' arteries are hardening.<br />Hopefully there are those who will pay heed to the message of Naomi Klein before it is too late.  The alternative is a nation of overworked people with hardened arteries and virtually empty pocketbooks as the designer suit brigade chalks up ever increasing profits.	2002-09-04

Once the site of the world's largest automotive plant, where Buicks were produced, the striped-pants brigade decided it would be cheaper to jettison the union and workers laboring at a decent pay level to whistle Dixie, go South and hire workers at low wages with no union standing in the way, upholding workers' rights.  What would happen to the folks in Flint?  Well...they would just have to learn to cope.  The job losses from GM's departure coupled with the ripple effect left a ghost town and one particularly steamed up resident with a sharp creative brain and the willingness to speak out.<br />That someone is Michael Moore and he has been speaking up for America's working families and downtrodden ever since.  These are the folks without the big bucks to gain access to the politicians in Washington.  How nice that they have a champion in Moore.<br />Moore in this brilliantly satirical work, reminiscent of the best of Swift and Rabelais, takes deadly aim at the \\"greed is good\\" mantra of the Bush-Cheney brigade.  After dissecting the corruption in the Bush \\"victory\\" in Florida thanks to the outright thievery of Governor Jeb and Catherine Harris, he moves on to the Bush Cabinet, citing all of the corporate and major oil involvements, concluding that they have arrived in Washington not to serve the people, as Thomas Jefferson wisely advocated so long ago, but to fill their pockets.<br />Keep churning out the words, Michael!

His succinct sportswriter's prose is ideal to depict time ticking events in the hot, humid days of summer as races move toward dramatic climaxes.  The winners will go on to the World Series while the losers go home to contemplate what went wrong.<br />Two crucial pennant races which came down to the wire involved instances where the Dodgers and Giants respectively became aroused as a result of slights.  The first instance was in 1934, when New York Giants' first baseman and manager Bill Terry was summarizing his view of the upcoming National League pennant race with New York reporters.  When asked about the Giants' bitter Gotham rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, then experiencing hard times, Terry smiled and exclaimed, \\"Are the Dodgers still in the league?\\"<br />As the pennant reached its crucial closing stages, and Terry's Giants were locked in a tight race with the \\"Gashouse Gang\\" St. Louis Cardinals with the Dean brothers, Joe Medwick, and playing manager Frankie Frisch,they concluded the season with two games at Ebbets Field against the Dodgers.  Remembering the Terry slight, Casey Stengel, who would later win five straight world titles from 1949 to 1953 with the New York Yankees, relished the opportunity along with his players to knock their New York rivals out of the race.  Stengel's Dodgers won both games and the Cardinals won the pennant, defeating the Detroit Tigers in seven games in the World Series.<br />The Dodgers failed to profit from history, since in 1951, seventeen years later, they defied the adage, \\"Never rile a Giant.\\"  After sweeping the Giants at Ebbets Field, the Dodgers taunted the team they believed to be out of the pennant.  In the small Ebbets Field clubhouse the home and visiting teams were separated by a tissue paper wall.  The Giants listened in helpless rage as Dodgermanager Chuck Dressen and his team sang, shouted, and taunted the Giants.  Jackie Robinson pounded a bat repeatedly against the wall.<br />Leo Durocher's Giants then came back from their presumed demise, winning 37 out of their last 44 games to finish in a first place tie with their hated rivals as the regular season ended.  The immortal three game playoff ended with Bobby Thomson's 3-run homer off of Dodger pitcher Ralph Branca for a 5-4 victory and a Giant pennant, a blast known as \\"the hit heard round the world.\\"<br />Another example of a presumed slight which helped change baseball history was in the second to last game of the 1949 season at Yankee Stadium.  The Boston Red Sox moved into New York up one game, needing only a split with the Yankees to qualify to play the Dodgers in the World Series.  Boston catcher Birdie Tebbets, a legendary bench jockey, chided Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto in the first game that the Red Sox would be starting their rookie fresh from college the next day.  An angry Rizzuto walked back to the bench and repeated the comment.  The inspired Yankees won both games and went on from there to defeat the Dodgers in five games in the World Series.<br />Anderson has plenty of interesting races to write about in addition to the aforementioned, including Gabby Hartnett's home run in the darkness in 1938 which propelled his Cub team to victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, and ultimately the National League pennant, along with the 1908 pennant races, when Detroit won a cliffhanger in the American League and the Cubs prevailed in a playoff game against the Giants of John McGraw, a contest resulting from Johnny Evers's protest over Fred Merkle failing to touch second base after the apparent winning hit had enabled the Giants to prevail.	2002-08-22

Along with Greg Palast and Kevin Phillips, she sees the inherent dangers of a world economy in which ethics and humane considerations have been preempted by a rush to riches of multinational corporations and international bankers, led by the World Trade Organization.<br />The gentle, soft spoken Hertz was one of the many individuals who was victimized by tear gas during the demonstrations in Genoa during World Trade Organization discussions in that city.  Regrettably even the highly respected New York Times political journalist Thomas Friedman, following such demonstrations against the WTO in Seattle, referred to the demonstrators as \\"flat earth proponents.\\"  Ms. Hertz does not fall into that category, as she demonstrates in her articulate presentation of how nations in need were ultimately bankrupted by loan policies dictated by the World Trade Organization.  She asserts that she is not opposed to major corporations entering the economic pictures of nations in our current multifaceted global economy.  What she abhors is the danger of such emergence without appropriate regulatory patterns being in place.  She accordingly parts company with the so-called \\"free market\\" concepts of economist Milton Friedman of the \\"Chicago School\\" and delineates how his theories misfired when applied by adherents such as Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in Great Britain.<br />Hertz notes that \\"the next revolution will not be on television.\\"  She is referring to the intellectual revolution to thwart ongoing efforts of WTO which have produced myriad problems in nations such as Bolivia, where the nation's water supply was privatized and controlled for a time by the Bechtel Corporation until the citizenry spontaneously erupted against prevailing policies, along with other destructive instances in such important South American nations as Argentina and Brazil.  The reason why she believes that this ongoing \\"revolution\\" will not be on television is that the media is so entwined with the corporate world, which pays huge amounts for commercial advertising.  Hertz sees danger in the control that these global corporate giants hold over the communications industry.<br />It is no accident that Hertz and her message has received its greatest attention in the alternative media.  Her brilliant work is rivaled by Gregory Palast of the BBC.  His evocative work on the excesses of the WTO, \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy,\\" belongs on the same coffee table next to Hertz's \\"The Silent Takeover.\\"	2002-07-11

He notes that at the Washington Times a contrary editorial policy was established which was the reverse of most newspapers, where content is diluted to remove overtly political proselytizing.  The practice, known as \\"Prudenizing,\\" was established by political editor Wes Pruden, and involved expanding stories by providing more overly political rightist bite.  At American Spectator he was encouraged to proceed full speed ahead against President Clinton.  The result was the infamous \\"Troopergate\\" story, which he now concedes was a virulent attack by Cliff Jackson, longtime Clinton Arkansas nemesis in conjunction with some disgruntled state troopers angry over being passed over for promotions they believed they deserved.  The American Spectator was financed by billionaire Richard Melon Scaife, who bankrolled the rightist media blitz to impeach President Clinton.<br />After much soul searching Brock then enraged his benefactors by writing a sympathetic biography of Hillary Rodham Clinton.  At that point he was denounced as a shameful turncoat by anti-Clinton haters hungry for more red meat of the Anita Hill stripe.  By then Brock had learned his lesson and was fresh out of hate, having seen Religious Right hypocrisy firsthandas adherents of monogamy and Puritanical living in reality often debauched themselves with womanizing and excessive drink.  As a result, Brock returned to his original roots as a Robert Kennedy liberal.	2002-07-11

As Vincent Bugliosi wrote concerning Palast, \\"Astonishing -- gets the real evidence no one else has the guts to dig up.\\"  Jim Hightower notes with awe, \\"The type of investigative reporter you don't see anymore --a cross between Sam Spade and Sherlock Holmes.\\"<br />Mesmerized readers learn early that it is incomprehensible to speed read or partially digest Palast's reportorial classic, \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.\\"  The danger is that the very information glossed over could prove to be the most significant of the book as Palast piles facts upon facts, providing the kind of illuminating insights into the real workings of American and global governments available only through reading alternative journalistic sources.  As Palast points out, the major media is interlocked with the corporate establishment.  As a result a \\"don't rock the boat\\" mentality prevails.  <br />Palast begins rocking the boat with a brilliant opening chapter in which he nails Governor Jeb Bush of Florida and his Secretary of State Catherine Harris for blatant violations of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  As a BBC correspondent Palast personally confronted Florida's Director of Elections, Clayton Roberts, with his smoking gun, a list verifying that no cross checking was done on the basis of raw data commissioned by Bush and Harris with the ostensible purpose of preventing felons from voting in the 2000 election.  Despite having paid for a cross check, which would have reduced a list of almost sixty thousand voters made ineligible to a mere fraction, Bush and Harris chose to accept the raw data list, which was preliminary and failed to even verify that names on it correlated with affected citizens in Florida.  When Roberts was confronted with the smoking gun by Palast he ended theinterview, darted into his office, and bolted the door shut.  It was all captured on camera, which Palast invites interested citizens to view on the Internet.<br />Having unmasked the Florida vote theft and subsequent triumph of an unelected president in the first chapter, one wonders where Palast can possibly go from there.  He does not disappoint, taking dead aim on the World Trade Organization and its Siamese twin, the World Bank.  Palast points out why President Bush is so insistent on obtaining \\"fast track\\" authority regarding agreements not subject to amendment by Congress, which conflicts with the U.S. Constitution.  Fast track authority is needed since the WTO's authority overrides that of national legislatures.  Palast reveals how the WTO in concert with the World Bank left nations such as Russia, Brazil and Argentina destitute in the wake of ponderous obligations, which through the ripple effect resulted in crushing poverty and unemployment.  He also details the provision of WTO in which nations with less pollution, such as Russia in the post-Communist era with sharply diminished factory production, can provide points to a nation such as the U.S., which then has purchased rights for the corporate establishment to produce more gases and toxic fumes for its citizens to breathe.<br />Palast, a one time student of Dr. Milton Friedman at Chicago University, exposes the charlatan economics of a man who, in the midst of taking credit for economic success in Chile, produced cataclysmic disaster.  He exposes British Prime Minister Tony Blair as \\"the toy boy of globalization\\" and looks into the charlatan economic endeavors of Pat Robertson.<br />Greg Palast is one of America's great patriots, someone who looks after the rights of citizens who are being trampled upon by the Bushie march into the New World Order, which he notes has a decided Orwellian 1984 character.  Palast is one of the patriotic contingent of the information super highway exposing the corruption ofthe powers that be, along with others such as Mike Ruppert of the \\"From the Wilderness\\" website and Michael Moore.<br />These courageous Americans dare to speak out!

He began as a master strategist in Richard Nixon's winning 1968 presidential campaign.  Accordingly, he understands Republican politics as an insider.  What brings chills to the master lobbyists and rightist new wealth yuppies is that Phillips understands the game they are playing, and the hypocrisy behind \\"getting the government off of people's backs\\" as the Reagan phrase went while bloating themselves on tax cuts and assorted bailouts and government boondoggles which steaily increase their wealth exponentially.<br />Phillips correctly defines America's current economic status as a plutocracy in which median wealth crested in the sixties and has been declining ever since.  The seas became increasingly rocky in the wake of the Reagan-mandated tax cuts passed by Congress in the eighties, increasing precipitously the gap between the \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots.\\"  Economist Lester Thurow sounded a dangerous warning several years ago when he noted that the disparity between rich and poor had reached revolutionary stages.  The situation has magnified since then and Phillips uses historical examples and numerous graphs to make his points with captivating lucidity.  His conclusions parallel those of Greg Palast, who has punctured the balloon of the World Trade Organization and its Siamese twin of the World Bank, whose pernicious actions resulted in the frightening burgeoning of Third World debt and poverty.  All the while, American manufacturers increase profits by utilizing slave labor in China and child labor in India and Bangladesh.  American workers are laid off as labor costs diminish through the use of unprincipled, scandalous profiteering through a cheap labor market by those who so frequently maintain themselves to be devoted churchgoers.<br />Let the spinmeisters of the Rupert Murdoch-Roger Ailes school attempt to refute the points scrupulously made by meticulousresearcher and brilliant author Kevin Phillips.  His presentation and conclusions are enough to leave even the loquacious Rush Limbaugh speechless.<br />As Phillips noted in a recent interview with Bill Moyers on PBS:  It is time for Americans to awaken before it its too late.  The stranglehold of the monopolist-super lobbyist axis threatens to choke democracy to death if vigilant steps are not taken by a properly outraged citizenry.	2002-05-19

After reading &quot;Politics of Glory&quot; I would like to nominate Bill James for Hot Stove League Commissioner.  The Hot Stove League is where baseball hungry fans spend their winter days arguing that &quot;My favorite player is better than yours!&quot;  James approaches baseball arguments the way a Philadelphia lawyer evaluates lucrative contracts, by examining every point with microscopic clarity.<br />A book about the Hall of Fame, with its unending controversies over just who is truly deserving of entry and who is not, is ideal grist for the analytical mind of James.  He covers many controversies, two of which surround Dodger pitcher Don Drysdale and Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto.  Drysdale had been voted into the Hall by the time James wrote his book while Rizzuto was elected just as James was completing his final chapter.  The evaluations of both players were so thorough that James concluded his analysis of Drysdale by covering the tall right-hander's performance in pennant stretch drives of the Dodgers as well as in the twelve games James deemed the most crucial of his career excluding World Series performances.  Rizzuto's Hall of Fame worthiness was ultimately evaluated by a statistically microscopic comparison of the Yankee star with his counterpart New York contemporary at shortstop, Pee Wee Reese of the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br />In addition to comparing and contrasting players both in and out of the Hall, James also delves into the politics of Cooperstown.  He decries the period of the fifties and sixties for what he deems less than deserving choices made by the Veterans Committee.  James pinpoints the reason as the leadership influence of Frankie Frisch, the great infielder of the Cardinals and Giants, whose love affair with the game of his playing days continued even when he was managing teams years later.  James notes that the &quot;Fordham Flash&quot; was less than a hit with his players for constantly proclaiming that &quot;The players of my days were much better than the players now.&quot;  Frisch's period on the Veterans Committee resulted in numerous former teammates being selected, including choices James statistically debunks as inadequate, including three former St. Louis Cardinals, pitcher Jess Haines, first baseman Jim Bottomly, and outfielder Chick Hafey.<br />Reading James improves a baseball fan's instincts for looking beyond the sheer numbers, such as park advantages, i.e.:  Did a pitcher perform in a home park favorable to pitchers or hitters or did a hitter play half his games in a stadium with short or long fences?  James comes up with some convincing arguments by searching in places where most fans have never treaded.	2002-05-02

The events depicted in \\"White Teacher\\" were drawn from fact, encompassing two years Kendall spent in Los Angeles area minority schools.  Kendall's rapid-paced first person narrative has him telling the story as \\"Mr. Brent,\\" an idealistic young teacher posted to a trouble-ridden South Los Angeles school where \\"weapons check\\" is the first order of business when students arrive.  When Brent seeks to immediately impose a solid curriculum to challenge students he is confronted by the school's principal, Mr. Towers, who explains that \\"as long as it looks as if the student is trying, then that student should be passed to the next grade.\\"  The class consists of one retarded youngster, Captain Smith, who crawls on his hands and knees, sits at one point on Brent's desk and blows on his hair, and finishes the year by proudly showing his teacher his achievement, an illegible attempt to copy the Yellow Pages of the Los Angeles Telephone Directory.  One student, George Washington, is a class leader who helps Brent overcome adversity by unruly students.  The chief class disrupter is Billy Parish, who at one point pulls a knife on his teacher.<br />\\"White Teacher in a Black School\\" was a book ahead of its time, one which helped lead the fight toward the adoption of standard testing prior to obtaining high school diplomas.  Not only did it sell briskly in the United States.  The book was also a major success in England, France and Switzerland, where it was published by companies in those nations.	2002-04-28

This is one reason why he has been described as \\"driven\\" in a way that his rival in the exciting, close 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush, was not, despite the fact that Bush is the son of a former chief executive.<br />Maraniss and Nakashima dig out the facts of Gore's boyhood and collegiate days.  They provide the formative clues which enable readers to determine what makes Al tick and prompts him to respond to political challenges with a dogged intensity.<br />Like the now President George W. Bush, Gore had strong political roots of his own, Albert Gore Senior, who was an intense achiever in the same tradition as his son.  Gore attended law school by night, romanced Gore's mother and married her during that busy period, then ultimately was elected first to the Congress, then the Senate.  He would ultimately be defeated in his bid for a fourth term in 1970 as a result of his opposition to the Vietnam War, which was frowned upon in conservative  circles in his home state of Tennessee.<br />From early boyhood Gore was groomed by his father to achieve the highest pinnacle of political success.  This commanding sense of duty would ultimately do him in during his debates with Bush.  Despite his command of political facts, and in some measure because of this trait, many voters became nervous by his intensity.  As a result this uncomfortable feeling saw these voters gravitate toward Bush and his offhand \\"ah shucks\\" manner.  Gore was seen as the class smart aleck determined to impress with his encyclopedic command of facts.<br />This intensity to strive, propelled into Gore early by his father, is explored in great depth extending into his political career as well.  Maraniss and Nakashima note that on many occasions, due to this intensity to strive successfully, Gore has been given to exaggerations which his political enemies would seek to extrapolate into untruths.  A classic case was Gore's statement that he \\"invented the Internet.\\"  When his qualification is examined one can see that this is an exaggeration rather than a falsehood since he was one of the farsighted Senators to recognize the potential of this soon to become American communications revolution.  He became one of the first Washington insiders to propose federal government funding for the new daring project.<br />Successful biography answers questions by presenting the backgrounds and actions of subjects, making them more comprehensible as people.  Maraniss and Nakashima succeeded in this endeavor in the case of Albert Gore.	2002-04-20

The history professor at Columbia University would ultimately win 2 Pulitzer Prizes before dying at the age of 54 in 1970.<br />The point Hofstadter consistently made is how important pragmatic considerations were in the evolution of the great political shakers and movers of American political annals.  He rejects the view of historian Charles Beard and others about the impact of economic determinism in the foundation and shaping of early America.  Hofstadter does not discount its impact, but cites the pragmatic necessity of studious compromise involving the interests of important American sociological groups which were often disparate, such as the manufacturing interests of the north and the rural farming interests of the south, as well as  slavery and anti-slavery interests.  The need for compromise influenced Thomas Jefferson in constructing a U.S. Constitution, which relied on the separation powers doctrine of English philosopher John Locke and that of separation of powers advanced by French social scientist Montesquieu.<br />The chapter on Franklin Delano Roosevelt is fascinating as a study in political pragmatism.  Roosevelt ran on a Democratic Party platform for 1932 which rivals one of the most conservative doctrines ever put on paper by an American political party.  He initially criticized incumbent President Herbert Hoover for spending too much money in dealing with the Depression and its related effects.  Once in office he changed his mind and forged a government activist agenda embraced by progressive reformers.<br />Abraham Lincoln is studied in detail as well within the framework of a very astute political figure with his eye squarely on success in that arena from the beginning, where the \\"railsplitter\\" image played well with voters.He purposely straddled the fence on the slavery issue since there was much controversy surrounding the issue even within the fledgling Republican Party which he joined after the Whig Party folded, despite its reputation for being an essentially anti-slavery party.<br />Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson are evaluated as two important political figures who perpetually juggled conservative basic instincts against the need they believed existed for certain progressive systemic reforms.  For Roosevelt this meant anti-trust legislation and conservation, while Wilson, whose traditional Virginia conservative roots left him unwilling to budge in the field of race relations, nonetheless undertook mighty electoral reforms embraced by William Jennings Bryan and the populist movement.  Bryan is another figure covered in the book.  <br />The chapter of Herbert Hoover is also fascinating.  Hofstadter envisioned him as the last of the laissez-faire American presidents.  In the wake of the great upheavals occurring in America, particularly related to the Great Depression, a political pragmatism later advanced by Roosevelt to stem the tide of unrest was eschewed by Hoover.	2002-04-18
US	52389304	RO70MJ6FKO5S5	0679762051	963527230	My Dark Places	Books	5	4	5	N	N	An Incredible Memoir	On a spring Sunday afternoon of 1958, 10-year-old James Ellroy returned to his El Monte residence after spending a weekend with his father.  He wondered why the residence was surrounded by police cars and uniformed officers.  Ellroy was quickly informed that his mother had been killed.<br />Jean Ellroy, a former Midwest beauty contest winner who had come to Southern California in hopes of becoming a film star, had been raped, then strangled, her body left in an empty lot next door to a school.  The tragic death prompted Ellroy's life to spin into a web of tragedy and confusion and he did not find himself and end his turbulent existence until he reached his thirties.<br />After his mother's death young Ellroy went to live with his father.  His parents had divorced and his father, an accountant who once worked for screen siren Rita Hayworth, was going to seed through alcohol.  At a time when Ellroy needed stability and proper attention he received neither.<br />Ellroy sought recognition in the wrong way.  Attending a predominantly Jewish school in West Los Angeles, he successfully shocked and antagonized his schoolmates after riding his bicycle to Hollywood and obtaining anti-Semitic right wing hate literature from the notorious John Birchite local bookstore, \\"Poor Richard's,\\" reading the material, then unleashing it on his schoolmates.  He also lost himself in a world of alcohol and drugs, holed up in an abandoned residence at one point, and burgled homes in the area.<br />His life began taking a different turn when he went to work at a ritzy local country club.  Though he was ultimately fired after a physical altercation, it was here that Ellroy stumbled on what would become a lucrative profession that would make him an international celebrity.  Still seeking to comprehend the meaning of his mother's unsolved murder, Ellroy began reading Jack Webb's magazine regularly.  Webb became famous in the fifties as the creator of the hugely successful \\"Dragnet\\" television series, which he produced and starred in, playing a Los Angeles police detective.  Ellroy read the magazines religiously, began reading crime novels of the greats such as Chandler and Hammett, and finally began writing himself.  It was anything but coincidental that one of Ellroy's biggest hits was \\"The Black Dahlia\\" based on the character Elizabeth Short, who came to Los Angeles in hopes of becoming a film star, was brutally murdered, and left in a vacant lot by her killer.  The facts closely paralleled the life and death of Jean Ellroy.<br />When Ellroy achieved riches and renown, also producing such runaway bestsellers as \\"American Tabloid\\" and \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" the latter becoming a highly successful film, he turned his attention to the detective case which had dominated his mind from 1958, the unsolved murder of his mother.  Ellroy secured the services of retired Los Angeles homicide detective Bill Stoner to assist him in his effort to crack the case.  Ultimately Stoner would become the detective novelist's best friend as they revisited crime scenes in and around El Monte and closely re-examined all available evidence.<br />While their cumulative efforts would not result in finding the killer or killers of Jean Ellroy, the novelist would find the experience cathartic.  He came to know his mother in a way he never had earlier.<br />One of the most interesting aspects of the investigation was the interview of a woman who had been working as a car hop at a drive in, believed to be the last person to see Jean Ellroy alive aside from her killer.  The woman described Jean as a gregarious, friendly woman.  The man with her, however, was uncommunicative.  The description she gave of a tall, swarthy, dark-haired man correlates with the disclosures of others who earlier that night saw Jean drinking with a man fitting that description at an El Monte nightclub-bar.  The same man had been seen at the same establishment as well as another in the area prior to that night.  He would never be seen again in the area.<br />Speculation further abounded over the murder by strangulation of a woman not far from where Jean Ellroy met her death about a year later.  If the suspect in question had been a serial killer, however, using that MO, then a question emerged:  Why was there no further evidence of future murders or attempts?  <br />The best guess as to what happened to Jean Ellroy was furnished by those who concluded that her killer, expecting sex, ran into resistance.  Deciding to take her despite her resistance, spurred on by alcohol, he ultimately concluded that it was better to kill Jean Ellroy rather than risk her reporting the rape to the police.  It was very late, dark, and there was presumably no one around so the rapist decided to opt for murder to silence Jean Ellroy.  Police investigators speculate that he was an intelligent, perhaps well educated man due to the thoroughness displayed subsequent to the killing.  In that he was never seen in El Monte again he might well have been from another area.<br />This is a work perhaps even more riveting than Ellroy's traditional page-turning fiction in that this is a story of a young boy who lost his mother at the impressionable age of 10, and who was determined to understand Jean Ellroy better and reach a measure of closure in his life.	2002-03-23
US	52389304	R1KAL7DIMZ1DB8	0805016732	45199741	John Steinbeck: A Biography	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A Master Writer's Hundredth Birthday	On February 27, 1902 John Steinbeck was born in Salinas, California. Now we stand at the centenary crossing, marking the one hundredth birthday of a Nobel Prize-winning novelist who, in the manner of few great creative artists, embodied the fundamental spirit of America's determination to overcome adversity. An ironic note from the career of Steinbeck, someone who wrote with such feeling about common folk overcoming adversity, particularly during the Great Depression,was that some of the most characteristic lines summing up the credo expressed in his writing came not from him but from Twentieth Century Fox studio head Darryl F. Zanuck, who started his film career as a screenwriter. At the close of the great John Ford film based on Steinbeck's greatest novel, \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" Zanuck, wanting the movie to end on an upbeat note, wrote the final scene in which Jane Darwell in her Oscar-winning performance summed up her feelings. Darwell delivered a testimonial about the survivalist nature of the common folk, with their ability to bounce back in the face of hardship.<br />Steinbeck is examined by Parini as an author always in touch with his roots. He was a classic example of the adage that a person should write about what one knows best. Doing so often got Steinbeck in trouble, as when residents of Monterey reportedly walked across the street rather than speak to him after he wrote \\"Cannery Row.\\" Steinbeck later set off a tempest in his hometown of Salinas with the publication of \\"East of Eden.\\" Citizens who had lived in Salinas for years recognized themselves as characters in the book. Steinbeck remembered the uproar years later when, not long before his death in 1968, he learned that the Salinas library would be named after him. \\"I wouldn't have been surprised if they had named the local house of ill repute after me,\\" the author quipped, \\"but I never expected to have the library named after me.\\"<br />The young Steinbeck tended to be shy and withdrawn. A neighborbecame a close friend and helped draw him out, Max Wagner, who later became a film actor and remained friends with Steinbeck during the rest of their lives. Max's brother Jack became a writer and collaborated with Steinbeck later on film projects. The two writers shared a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award nomination for their work in the 1945 film \\"A Medal for Benny.\\" Steinbeck and Max Wagner each left Salinas to attend Stanford University in nearby Palo Alto. They both left after one year, restless creative spirits who hated confinement.<br />Parini reveals the painful experience of writing for Steinbeck, who endured numerous ailments from the early days of his career. The biographer reveals the \\"earthy\\" propensity of Steinbeck's subject matter, including such an early work as \\"Tortilla Flat,\\" which revealed the lives of impoverished Mexicans living in shacks in Monterey. Later his close friendship with local Monterey marine biologist, Dr. Edward F. Ricketts, was revealed. The man known as \\"Doc\\" to localies was played by Nick Nolte in the screen adaptation of the Steinbeck novel \\"Cannery Row.\\" In the case of Steinbeck's master work, \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" the author carefully researched California migrant camps, a major element of the story as Oklahomans fleeing the great dust bowl resided in them on the way to establishing their own roots moving westward. Steinbeck had an excellent guide, Tom Collins, who managed the Kern County Migrant Camp and became a friend of the author's. Steinbeck's great novel was dedicated partially to Collins as he wrote: \\"To Tom -- who lived it.\\" It was a simple dedication which meant so much, so typically earthy, and so typically Steinbeck.<br />One important friendship Steinbeck formed was with fellow humanitarian and author, Carl Sandburg, poet and Lincoln biographer. Actor Burgess Meredith also became a close friend after starring in the brilliant 1939 film adaptation of Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men.\\"<br />Long before Cesar Chavez was available to courageously carry the banner of the exploited Mexican braceros, Steinbeck fought tirelessly for their cause along with crusading journalist Carey McWilliams. Steinbeck was a stalwart advocate of the New Deal of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and became a friend and devoted admirer of two time Democratic presidential nominee Adlai E. Stevenson, for whom Steinbeck wrote speeches during his losing 1956 campaign to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.<br />Parini provides a solid account of Steinbeck as a man, including defeats as well as triumphs. In the former category there were Steinbeck's problematical marriages and difficulties with fatherhood. The biographer notes the success of Steinbeck's last marriage to Elaine Scott Steinbeck, the former wife of actor Zachary Scott. The two became initially fond of each other after the actress Ann Sothern, who had her own romantic designs on the famous author, brought her friend Elaine along for a Northern California visit. The women stayed at a Carmel hotel and Steinbeck, then living in Monterey, showed them the sights. It soon became obvious that the author's designs were on Elaine rather than the actress. \\"I don't think Ann ever forgave me,\\" Elaine Scott Steinbeck later revealed.<br />Parini does a superb job of capturing a man of many parts, an author in touch with America's roots.  Steinbeck's works are an evocation of the adventurousness and tenacity of the American spirit.	2002-03-20

In fact, the book is outlined much in the manner of a top rate survey course, possessing the vital ingredient of bold head outlines and  charts.  It would be easy for playwrights to develop their own checklists, flow charts, or a series of note cards covering the essentials of the craft from the lifting of the first curtain to the drawing of the final curtain.  Also, when the playwrights make a point about motive, plot development, or dramatic conflict, they follow up their assertions with examples from established works extending back as far as Greek drama. <br />For those who write both plays and screenplays, this work is highly valuable in that the authors point out the basic differences of the two pursuits, and how some writers become trapped by confusing one with the other.  The authors point out the difference between the visual medium of film with the reliance on a camera and cinematic effects alongside the on the scene visuality and focus on the well stated word that chracterizes the immediacy of a theatrical experience.<br />Downs and Wright devote extensive detail to the importance of plotting and characterization, providing road maps to keep the industrious writer on track.  In addition, they provide play samples.  This serves two excellent purposes: 1) reading how a well crafted play develops on the printed page; 2) demonstrating the proper editorial technique for writing a play so that improper form can be avoided, and the damaging recognition of technical presentation flaws by skilled theatrical readers.	2002-03-10

The Vietnam War caused Johnson to lose mental and emotional control, becoming a troubled man in a most dangerous position.  In the case of Richard Nixon, his successor in the Oval Office, a pattern of instability had been recognizably long afoot prior to assuming office.  <br />Anthony Summers is a prodigious researcher, a former BBC operative who has used his voracious capacity for research to generate a successful career in biography.  He previously wrote a massively researched work on former F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover.  <br />Summers reveals the almost total career long involvement of Nixon with Dr. Arnold Hutschnecker, a highly acclaimed psychotherapist, who attempted to steer Nixon past his mercurial mood swings, particularly his bouts with depression.  Summers recounts Hutschnecker's comment to then Senator Nixon about his dislike for Joseph McCarthy, upon which Nixon responded with the look of a sad-eyed boy, replying, \\"But he's my friend.\\"<br />Summers cites his research and does not editorialize in situations where the facts lead in a particular direction but  cannot be conclusively established.  Such is the case with Nixon's relationship with his long suffering wife Pat.  Summers cites evidence of the possibility that Nixon on two occasions physically abused his wife to the point where she required hospitalization, using interviews with former Nixon aides to reach this possible conclusion, which he concedes rests on entirely circumstantial evidence.<br />Another area where Summers unleashes controversial research is with what was considered Nixon's greatest triumph as a Congressman, his role in the conviction of former State Department aide Alger Hiss of perjury, leading to the conclusion that Hiss was a Communist spy.  Theresult boosted Nixon's stock and he was able to shortly thereafter be elected to the Senate.  The typewriter allegedly owned by Hiss was produced to prove that letters written to government witness and former Communist Whittaker Chambers must have been typed on it.  After Hiss' conviction for perjury he alleged that it rested on \\"forgery by typewriter.\\"  Nixon scoffed at the charge, contending that it was impossible to forge a typewriter, a claim he repeated as late as 1976.  Summers reveals evidence that American and British intelligence operatives had developed as early as 1941 machines that \\"could reproduce faultlessly the imprint of any typewriter on earth.\\"<br />Summers also delves into Nixon's pathological obsession with the Kennedys, and how it drove him to excesses in his political career, covering ground also recently traversed by Chris Matthews.  He also cites Nixon's sellouts to big business early in his career, as well as presenting evidence that he became involved with the mob through his association with his close Florida banker friend Bebe Rebozo long before he became president.<br />Nixon's ultimate breakdown during the Watergate period is also covered in detail, along with his pathological obsession over political groups he considered his natural enemies, notably Jewish liberals.  Summers focuses on Nixon's heavy drinking during the burdensome Watergate period, in which he would make comments to Secretary State Henry Kissinger regarding the Vietnamese Communists such as, \\"Let's nuke 'em, Henry.\\"  His ultimate mental and emotional instability during this troubling period prompted Kissinger along with Chief of Staff Alexander Hague to alert the Armed Forces Chief of Staff to ignore critical military orders given by Nixon.<br />\\"The Arrogance of Power\\" displays the shocking potential consequences of the tragedies that could result from an emotionally unstable president in a nuclear world.  During Nixon's worst period, less than a year before he wouldbecome the first chief executive in U.S. history to resign, the nation stood on the possible brink of nuclear war with the Soviet Union during the October 1973 Israeli-Arab conflict.	2002-03-10

He is brought to life in all his myriad complexities by sagacious and colorful Guardian columnist Francis Wheen, whose extensive research has resulted in a comprehensive study of Karl Marx as opposed to Marxism.<br />Wheen is at an advantage being a knowledgeable British analyst of lives and politics.  His readers benefit from his Britishness as well since he is able to provide profound insight on the period in which Marx lived in London as well as the mindset of British thinkers, so often a problem for the German born revolutionary since his intellectual underpinnings remained basically in Europe.  A writer from another country would be unlikely to provide the kind of unique sociological insight which Wheen provides in this informative as well as readable work.<br />Wheen points out early in the book that London was the inevitable stopping point and permanent base for Marx since it was a melting pot of disparate viewpoints embraced by revolutionary thinkers throughout the world.  Many, like Marx, were banished from many nations.  Marx was evicted from his native Germany, but never stopped thinking European and interacting with Europeans whenever possible.<br />The London in which Marx did his studying and writing is described by Wheen in Dickensian terms.  The author notes the high degree of childbirth death and paints a picture correlative with Dickens' \\"Bleak House.\\"  In addition to experiencing numerous health problems, enduring particularly painful carbuncles, his life was shrouded in sadness over the four children who predeceased him.  The Marx tragedy continued after his 1883 death with the suicides of his only surviving offspring, daughters Eleanor and Laura.  The only child who endured over an entire life cycle was an illegitimate son, Freddy Demuth, who lived and worked quietly in East London and died of cardiac failure in 1929 at the age of 77.<br />Marx's hatred for Russia is noted, a sore point with Communist adherents of Marxism-Leninism.  An interesting element of Wheen's work is his focus on Marx the determined bourgeois figure.  Despite his intellectual concern for the working classes and loathing of the bourgeoisie, which he insisted in his works needed to be overthrown, through his friend and faithful associate Friedrich Engels' money, he hired servants and managed to maintain living quarters well beyond his means.  This occurred due to Engels' devotion to him and his cause.  Engels worked for over 20 years at his father's Manchester factory.  In addition to being a free-spirited advocate of free love, Engels also preferred the bourgeois social existence, leading an active social life in Manchester that included a vigorous devotion to the aristocratic sport of fox hunting.<br />Wheen points out that Marx miscalculated on the subject of proletarian revolt in England, ironically failing to perceive that the bourgeois, aristocratic classes and working classes would interlock in certain areas just as he had managed to live a bourgeois life while achieving a reputation as the leading intellectual architect of revolution in the nineteenth century.  Wheen cites the current England in which all classes of citizens shop at Tesco and the younger members of the royalty attend rock concerts and wear jeans and baseball caps.<br />Wheen sees Marx as an intellectual rather than an overtly forceful, violent revolutionary.  He notes that journalists the world over who interviewed him at his residence would be surprised to find someone more closely resembling an erudite, friendly college professor rather than a bomb throwing revolutionary.  Wheen notes the dissimilarities between Marx and one of his most hated rivals in Communist revolutionary circles, the Russian anarchist Bakunin.	2002-03-05

James once more leaves fans a tome filled with fascinating facts and opinions in \\"The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.\\" As one who has enjoyed comparing outputs of players from different eras, I have thoroughly enjoyed using James' inventive electronic baseball encyclopedia. Where James shines is that he knows just what makes baseball fans tick. The diamond sport is intriguing due to its dramatic day by day element along with the numerous matchups and statistical possibilities that make watching the sport fun and second guessing inevitable to knowledgeable fans. Why do certain hitters shine against particular pitchers? Why do some excellent pitchers have tremendous difficulty with certain teams and particular batters? James knows enough to focus on the fine details of the game, from which knowledge is gleaned as to how certain managers can pull off major pennant victories by making the appropriate moves.<br />James has one section revealing an all-time all-star team of productive players beyond the age of 35. Perhaps the most fascinating section of the book is his all-time position by position choices and his rationale for his decisions. Yogi Berra edges out Johnny Bench for the number one spot among catchers, Willie Mays is selected number one at center field over Ty Cobb, and Walter Johnson is chosen as the greatest pitcher of all time with Lefty Grove in second place.  Two Yankee immortals hold down their respective positions with Lou Gehrig James' choice at first base and the legendary \\"Sultan of Swat\\" Babe Ruth gaining the nod in right field. <br />Another James strength is his ability to see all aspects of diamond play, revealing a player's ability to achieve victory through offensive and defensive efforts, then further breaking matters down to hits, accomplishments on the base paths, along with the value of a strong throwing arm in the field and the ability to make circus catches and pounce on sharply hit ground balls. James sees the player in every dimension of his on field existence.<br />Mrs. James also comes into the picture. Bill notes that his wife fastidiously looked at his baseball cards and has made her opinions known on the best looking players of each decade. How many other baseball analysts have covered this point? James never runs out of interesting categories to discuss, making eager fans always beg for more.	2002-02-28
US	52389304	R1F7WEZOXG2RJF	0060956348	393219968	The Boys of Summer	Books	5	8	8	N	N	As Authentic as it Gets	As a former sportswriter who once covered the Dodgers, I can vouch for the authenticity of Roger Kahn's excellent book about the fabulous Brooklyn days and the tenacious loyalty of Dodger fans.  While I did not cover the Dodgers until they reached their next and current home of Los Angeles, I had heard and read much about the great Brooklyn heritage and was delighted to read a book by a talented sportswriter who covered the Dodgers during that glorious period when New York City had three exceptional major league teams, the indomitable Yankees, likened to General Motors for efficiency, and who were situated in the Bronx, the Giants located a short trip from Yankee Stadium over the East River bridge in the Coogan's Bluff area of Manhattan, where they called the Polo Grounds home, and the Dodgers, who played to packed throngs of 35,000 roaring fans at Ebbets Field on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn.<br />One of the most informative portions of this book was Kahn's revelations about the man who changed professional sports, Jackie Robinson, who broke the color line by becoming the first African-American to play in the major leagues.  A fiercely proud man who fought hard for civil rights, through Robinson's lobbying Southern parks where the Dodgers played exhibition games abandoned Jim Crow policies of forcing African Americans to sit in separate sections.  Robinson is described in one instance reprimanding thankful African Americans who thanked ushers for allowing them to sit with the general populace.  &quot;Don't thank them,&quot; Robinson called out from the field.  &quot;It's your right.&quot;<br />Kahn describes the tensions of tough pennant drives in the dog days of summer.  On one occasion he is concerned that the combative Eddie Stanky, who has taken exception to what Kahn has written, will attack him physically.  In another instance he does his best to calm an angry Duke Snider from attacking a writer with whom he has become upset.  Kahn expresses concern that the strong, athletic Snider might seriously injure the writer and get himself in a great deal of trouble.<br />The fifties period described by Kahn was one where three great centerfielders in one city would all be honored with induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.  Snider was a fixture in centerfield for the Dodgers, while Willie Mays played the position for the Giants, with Mickey Mantle assuming it for the Yankees.  All possessed great power with the bat and the exceptional fleet footedness of players playing a position where covering a great deal of ground defensively is a must.<br />Kahn knowledgeably addresses the qualitative factor with the Dodgers and the Yankees.  During the fifties the Yankees and Dodgers met in the World Series in 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956.  During the forties the teams had met in the post-season classic in 1941, 1947 and 1949.  The Bronx Bombers won every series save one, the 1955 showdown when 22-year-old rookie lefthander Johnny Podres blanked the vaunted Yankees 2-0 in game seven, which marked the first and only World Series victory for the Dodgers during their Brooklyn existence.  Kahn breaks down the two teams, concluding that the Dodgers rated a close edge among the regulars but that the Yankee advantage stemmed from superiority in the pitching department.<br />If you love great baseball writing, this is one book you do not want to miss.  Kahn sets down his interesting facts with a  thoroughly readable lucidity.	2002-02-10

Truman, 1945-1948 (Give em Hell Harry)	Books	5	15	15	N	N	A Pivotal Period of History and a Pivotal Subject	While David McCullough's more recent biography of Harry Truman has received widespread recent attention, Robert J. Donovan's earlier biography published in 1977 has much to recommend it.  Whereas McCullough's extensive volume covers Truman's entire life, Donovan zeroes in on the pivotal period of a pivotal presidency.  Donovan begins as Truman takes over the awesome responsibility of the presidency after Franklin D. Roosevelt's death.  Donovan covers in perceptive detail Truman's decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan as a means of ending World War Two.  Donovan follows the war to its conclusion, and also focuses carefully on the exciting 1948 presidential campaign, when Truman scored one of the greatest upsets in American political history by defeating heavily favored Republican nominee Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York.<br />Donovan turns an astute eye as well on Truman's great foreign policy accomplishments of the Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, and the creation of NATO.  As a Middle East historian, I was benefitted by his thorough presentation of the controversy leading up to the granting of recognition to the new nation of Israel, and how Truman's decision was crafted.<br />I would urge that any dedicated Truman scholar should read both the McCullough and Donovan volumes.  McCullough covers a wider perspective, while Donovan, on the other hand, gives broader coverage to the pivotal foreign policy events from 1945 to 1948, as well as Truman's sensational upset victory over Dewey.	2002-02-08

Their world is the violent one of boxing, but their struggles for survival are more universal than just any conventional story about men battling professionally in the squared circle.  You do not have to be a fight fan to appreciate this arresting work.<br />Leonard Gardner has followed the rule of thumb laid down years ago of &quot;Write what you know.&quot;  Gardner grew up in Stockton and knows the lower middle class world he describes with graphic brilliance.  He was an amateur boxer, giving him a knowledge of how men struggle to survive in that competitive and highly dangerous world.<br />Gardner's story craft is straight out of Albert Camus, in many ways reminiscent of his epic novella, &quot;The Stranger.&quot;  His descriptions of dingy bars and dreary hotel rooms ring with clarity, transferring readers to a world of existential survival where some cling to hope while others have long since given up.<br />Tully was on the verge of being a contender but lost a major fight, hit the bottle, and quit boxing.  He got a job as a short order cook.  After going to the local high school gym to work out he meets Ernie Munger.  At 18 Ernie is eleven years Tully's senior.  He becomes so impressed by Munger's moves that he recommends that he visit Lido Gym and look up his former manager.  When Munger begins boxing amateur Tully's interest increases and he is motivated to launch a comeback.<br />Tully and Munger seek extra money by working as field pickers under a broiling sun.  Tully finds temporary romance with Oma, a woman he meets in a bar with such a propensity for alcohol that he moves out of her dingy hotel room and back to his own, warned by his manager that she will destroy his concentration as he prepares for a main event bout in Stockton.  Meanwhile Munger impregnates a young local woman, marries her, and with additional incentive, turns professional.<br />Gardner wrote the screenplay for the electrifying film version directed by John Huston, which starred Stacy Keach, Jeff Bridges and Susan Tyrell.  It matches the tenaciously gripping, Camus-like existential reality of the book.	2002-02-01

The activities were so involved as well as interesting that a movie about the making of \\"The Third Man\\" might prove almost as interesting as the magnificent cinema classic itself.<br />The film was a co-production effort involving Britain and America.  Two legendary figures were involved in each continent, the fascinating Eastern European emigre Sir Alexander Korda in London and David O. Selznick in Hollywood.  Assistant director Guy Hamilton relates that dealing with Selznick's renowned memos entailed virtually a full time job in itself.  Selznick was worried at various points about Joseph Cotten being too much of a bumbler, making Americans in general look bad, as well as fearing that Cotten and his longtime friend from Mercury Theater days, Orson Welles, were both \\"frustrated writers\\" who would make life miserable for Reed by ad libbing lines.  As fate turned out, only one ad lib was delivered, Welles' memorable line to Cotten after exiting the giant ferris wheel in the Vienna Woods about Italy achieving the Renaissance during a 30 year period of bloodshed and Switzerland, after centuries of peace, becoming notable for the cuckoo clock.<br />One humorous segment of the book involves the pursuit of Welles, who had fled throughout Europe before being discovered in Venice, the actor's way of obtaining revenge against Korda for a period of inactivity while under contract to him.  Once that Welles arrived in Vienna he panicked over doing scenes in the city's sewer system, where some of the most dramatic moments of the film occur when police chase the racketeer near the movie's end.  An unruffled Reed announced that the sewer system scenes involving Welles would be shot on new sets at Sheperton Studios outside London, where many of the interiors were shot.<br />One of the most unique features of the film was the substitution of zither player Anton Karas for what would normally be a symphonic musical background.  The book reveals how Reed stuck to his guns in the wake of criticism of his idea by Sheperton's musical director, Dr. Hubert Clifford.  We also learn just how and where Karas was found, along with reading interesting details of his audition in Reed's hotel room during one of the few days when cast and crew were not busy.<br />Drazin reveals his theory about screenwriter Graham Greene's real life model of the film's villain, Harry Lime, who was played so convincingly by Welles.  Drazin believes that Lime was modeled after Kim Philby, the British intelligence operative who spied for Russia.	2002-01-27
US	52389304	R3N50QFEZXIV29	0312145780	751150591	David Lean: A Biography	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Covering All Phases of a Fascinating and Complicated Genius	Kevin Brownlow touched all bases of David Lean's life, providing insight into the films and his unconventionally fascinating life, making this one of the finest film biographies I have ever read about a cinema giant about whom I had longed to learn more about.  Brownlow divides Lean's career into two distinct phases, 1) the British period in which he worked at home and captured the true essence of his people and, 2) the international phase in which the master film craftsman lived in hotels and moved from one country to another in producing a series of internationally spectacular movies such as \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" and \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai.\\"<br />Brownlow begins with Lean's roots as a restless youngster in the London suburb of Croydon.  His lack of curiosity and penchant for traditional school learning coupled with the stolen hours he spent sitting inside darkened theaters in a state of fascination revealed where his adult years would be spent.  <br />Once that Lean began following his dream he quickly became established as Britain's foremost film editor.  In that context Brownlow expunges a canard that was carried all the way to obituaries after the great director's death in 1990 that Noel Coward gave the aspiring director a leg up in teaming up with him to co-direct the brilliantly done war film about the British Navy, \\"In Which We Serve,\\" in which Coward also starred along with Celia Johnson and John Mills.  It turned out that Coward's move proved to his personal benefit as Lean did most of the directing and Coward was concerned mainly about his own scenes, after which he would generally leave the set, entrusting the basic direction of the film to Lean.  We also learn that Lean, unlike Sir Carol Reed and other prominent British directors, turned down a chance to begin his directing career on low budget \\"quota quickies,\\" deciding instead to wait for a major opportunity, which came with \\"In Which We Serve.\\"  Later that same year one of Lean's greatest films, the epic love story \\"Brief Encounter\\" with Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson, hit the screens and the young director's career was away in a flourish.<br />After achieving prominent worldwide status as a great international director, Lean's sensitivity resulted in overreacting to the criticism of tart New Yorkers at a Round Table session at the Algonquin Hotel.  Lean was sharply criticized for \\"Ryan's Daughter,\\" which American critics such as Richard Schickel and Pauline Kael believed was well below the high standard he established with \\"Brief Encounter\\" and continued with other films.  According to Brownlow, Lean was sufficiently wounded to take a sabbatical before doing his last film, the highly acclaimed Indian epic \\"Passage to India\\" based on the E.M. Forster literary classic.<br />Brownlow does a superb job of depicting the period and the films from Lean's prolific career.  Lean's was a mastery of style and entertainment, enriching story telling with beautiful visual imagery and word economy in the best sense, making the language all the more meaningful.  This book does his career justice while enhancing our knowledge of a great man.	2002-01-24

There is much about the presidents individually from Washington to the present while presenting historians and research enthusiasts alike with an opportunity to zero in on a particular president and his era and learn much more.  There are thorough listings of cabinet members, detailed informations on vice-presidents, and lists of books available on the leaders and the periods of which they were a part for those who wish to do additional research on presidents and their eras.  <br />One of my favorite parts of the book was the section dealing with presidential campaigns.  One can easily get a feel for an era and its leaders by reading about the campaigns, learning about the major issues involved, and analyzing the critical problems facing the nation at those points, whether it be slavery and the Civil War or the Depression of the thirties.  Comprehensive election results are also available, whereby interested readers can discern just where the country stood at a given point in time in terms of the voting power strengths of the parties regionally.  Trends become clearly discernible through careful analysis.<br />I also like the way that comments regarding presidents, both pro and con, appear, done in an objective way.  Patterns become discernible as to which major political forces backed and opposed certain presidents as well as why.	2002-01-23

Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon.  Going back to when they first met, at the start of the 80th Congress in 1947, and continuing long after Kennedy's tragic assassination in 1963, until Nixon's resignation from office in 1974, Matthews reveals the ebb and flow of the relationship, and how it affected history.  His story continues after Kennedy's death due to Matthews' convincing theory about how the deceased president and his family left President Nixon in a state of obsession, prompting him to go to extreme lengths to help assure his victory in 1972, convinced that the Kennedy legacy and the deceased president's youngest brother, Senator Edward \\"Ted\\" Kennedy, could thwart his chances for a second term.<br />Matthews draws his analogy from the Peter Shafer play and subsequent film \\"Amadeus,\\" which revealed the tremendous jealousy of famous Austrian court composer Salieri toward young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  While an accomplished professional, Salieri was obliged to rely upon form and hard work.  Mozart, on the other hand, exuded a seemingly effortless genius and that indefinable quality known as charisma.  <br />Nixon felt the same way about the handsome young Senator Kennedy.  He felt in his shadow when in the presidency and was fearful that Ted Kennedy would ultimately seek the big prize in 1972.  Matthews cites the Ted Kennedy factor as a major reason why Nixon, determined to leave as little to chance as possible, launched his ruthless Palace Guard operation which culminated in a \\"Dirty Tricks\\" campaign and Watergate, which resulted in Nixon becoming the only U.S. president to resign from office.<br />Matthews reveals that Kennedy and Nixon began as friends but, as it became increasingly obvious that they would oppose each other for the presidency, became tenacious competitors.  Matthews tells his readers that the first Kennedy-Nixon presidential debate in 1960, in which Nixon's stiffness cost him dearly, had been preceded by a similar debate in 1947 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, when they were both freshmen congressmen.  On that occasion, as in 1960, Kennedy was the ingratiating debater, relaxed, making contact with his audience.  Nixon, on the other hand, was like the tense debate competitor seeking to impress a panel of judges, concentrating on raw facts at the expense of failing to generate warmth and spontaneity.<br />Matthews saw Nixon as the ultimate journeyman and Kennedy as the politician touched with genius.  He notes that there are no memorable phrases associated with Nixon speeches whereas Kennedy is known for his electrifying Berlin speech as well as his inaugural address, when he stated, \\"My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\\"	2002-01-21

There has been much debate about the propriety of retaining the Electoral College, designed by the Constitution's framers, in the wake of the controversial 2000 presidential election, in which Albert Gore won the popular vote but George Bush, following the Florida recount controversy, emerged as winner by obtaining more electoral votes.  <br />Since Jules Witcover's &quot;No Way to Pick a President&quot; came out before the 2000 election, and devoted much attention to the subject of the Electoral College and why it should be abolished, was the author a psychic?  The answer is that he did not need to possess psychic powers to see the importance of the topic.  He had a long background of political professionalism and has seen our system deteriorating for some time.  As well as covering the topic of the Electoral College, Witcover devotes much time and attention to the evolution of what it has become.  He is highly critical of a system increasingly taken over by public relations and advertising pundits offering snappy one-liners and spin control at the distinct sacrifice of broad discussion of the major issues confronting America domestically and internationally.  Witcover cites the diminishing numbers of voters who cast ballots in presidential elections, along with the complaints of citizens indicating how turned off they have become with the system.<br />Witcover scrutinizes the role of the political consultant in the system, giving a historical analysis of the phenomenon, its roots, and where it has taken us.  He cites the success record of pioneers in the field, the team of Spencer and Roberts in California.  Witcover explains how they conscientiously boosted the image of former motion picture actor Ronald Reagan, carefully cultivating a positive image that took him initially to the governorship in California, then the presidency.<br />The author, a veteran of many presidential campaigns,provides both an overall perspective and possible reforms to make the system more wieldy and palatable to voters.  Witcover has co-authored several books with Jack Germond about presidential campaigns they have jointly covered.	2002-01-18

Skehan did a comprehensive, thoroughly professional biography on a great champion long deserving such attention.  Rocky Marciano's soft spoken demeanor prompted him to stay away from media opportunities and let his fists do the talking for him.  His incredible record of 49 consecutive professional victories with 43 knockouts serves as a glittering testimonial to his skills.<br />With his quiet demeanor, often to the point of preferring to stay in the background, Marciano would more than likely led an unobtrusive life in his native Brockton, Massachusetts and never missed the publicity had it not been for the fact that he was endowed with a rock hard body and the kind of stamina that brings back memories of boxing's only 3 time champion of the thirties, Hammering Henry Armstrong.  Marciano had the shortest reach of any heavyweight titlist, but made up for it with a swarming style that smothered opponents, along with a solid punch that eliminated them.<br />Skehan's life reveals a major point of irony in life, the relativity of great talents.  Marciano had one of the solidest constitutions of any fighter in ring history, possessing awesome power, yet, when he sought to pursue his first love as a boy growing up, baseball, by trying out for the Chicago Cubs s a catcher, he was thwarted.  Marciano had the same kind of stolid, stocky build as all-time catching great Yogi Berra of the Yankees.  When he tried out for the Cubs, however, he was rejected for not having a strong enough throwing arm.  The short term loss proved to be his long term gain since, unless he had ability to rise to the level of a Berra and become a Hall of Famer, Marciano's accomplshments would have diminished compared to his boxing achievements as one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time.<br />Marciano was a tireless worker, as this biography reveals.  He was able to resist temptation in his determination to reach the top of the fight game in a career that spanned less than a decade, from 1948 to his retirement in 1955 with his celebrated 9th round knockout of Archie Moore, the world light heavyweight champion.  Even while on his honeymoon in Miami Beach, Marciano would faithfully rise each morning to do his roadwork on the hotel golf course.  On occasions when temptation beckoned and a beautiful woman would be available, Marciano bypassed the momentary pleasure to stay in shape during his fight career.  As a result, when he did retire Marciano loaded up on calories and tasted delights of the flesh in rapid scale fashion, seeking to make up for lost time.  <br />While understanding the reason behind Muhammad Ali's &quot;I am the greatest&quot; media campaign, which he acknowledged with the words, &quot;He's trying to build a gate,&quot; he also let it be known that he did not appreciate such public relations tactics.  He was a quieter sort and such a demeanor was inconsistent with his being and perhaps his understanding.<br />Skehan also carves out interesting sketches of Marciano's trainer Charlie Goldman and his manager Al Weill.  Marciano revered the respected veteran trainer Goldman.  He could not abide Weill, particularly when the manager wanted to sack Marciano's life long Brockton friend Allie Colombo.  The fiercely loyal Marciano insisted that Colombo be kept on the payroll as a managerial and training assistant.	2002-01-17

A smear was launched against Sinclair based on his socialist roots.  What was termed socialist in those days, as evidenced later by perennial Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas, was a strong desire for regulation, better working conditions, and greater security for the citizenry in the retirement and medical care areas.  While Sinclair, due to his Socialist background and controversy over his End Poverty in California program, failed to receive the endorsement as Democratic Party nominee from an apprehensive Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he obtained financial assistance from wealthy Los Angeles socialist property magnate Gaylord Wilshire and many grassroots volunteers seeking security and justice during the ravages of the Great Depression.<br />Louis B. Mayer, William Randolph Hearst and other powerful monied interests fought hard to prevent Sinclair from winning, or having his platform properly debated.  Mayer had MGM make and release so-called documentaries which were shown in his studio's movie houses revealing scores of impoverished people coming to California to get in on Sinclair's largesse and take advantage of his promise to end poverty in the state.  One controversial segment showed a man with a thick Russian accent exclaiming soothly, &quot;Well, Sinclair's ideasworked in Russia.  I don't see why they won't work here.&quot;<br />These were blatant propaganda films purported to reveal spontaneous behavior which were actually rehearsed efforts with actors performing their intended roles.  They worked all the same.  The fact that Sinclair's socialism was rooted in humanism and not Marxism was deliberately overlooked as distortion and fearmongering prevailed.<br />Despite these efforts, and being hopelessly outspent, Sinclair ran a spirited campaign based on ideas and ran a strong if unsuccessful race.  After it was all over he took it all philosophically, exclaiming that, &quot;If I'd been elected governor I wouldn't be able to continue sleeping with my bedroom window open.&quot;	2002-01-17

He was informed that he could extend the time remaining to a limited degree by being careful of what he ate and seeing that he did not tax himself.<br />With those thoughts in mind, the mogul boarded a boat for presumably his final journey abroad.  After the ship got out to sea and the New Yorker had nothing but time to think, surrounded by blue water on all sides, he decided to throw caution to the winds and enjoy what time remained to him.  He began to eat what he wanted, disdaining medical advice, as well as jettisoning cautionary warnings about overtaxing himself.  The next thing he knew he had infused himself with such joy of living that he began gaining weight, strength, and stamina, not to mention enjoying himself thoroughly.  By the time he reached Europe he was a new man and the presumably fatal illness was no more than a bad dream in his memory bank.<br />Carnegie recalls a delightful Thanksgiving dinner he had with Jack Dempsey in a New York restaurant.  Dempsey explained how, initially, after having lost his heavyweight championship to Gene Tunney, he decided to concentrate, instead of feeling depressed, on accomplishing good and enjoying himself at the same time.  Dempsey told Carnegie that in looking back he was actually a happier man in the years following what could have been a bitter disappointment, after losing his title, than in his glory days when he reigned as world heavyweight championship.  His determined mental attitude paved the way.<br />Carnegie also relates how he conquered adversity to become famous.  A shy youngster growing up in rural Missouri, he was overcome by self-doubt after moving to New York City.  He decided to conquer his shyness by becoming an adept public speaker.  Since the challenge was so difficult he concentrated intensely and spent much time and effort learning about the proper elements of speaking.

It was CBS which, in 1962, initially forecast Richard M. Nixon's loss in the California governor's race against incument Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown, beating Huntley and Brinkley to the punch.<br />The informative Plissner does not just write about CBS triumphs.  He mentions that the cautionary approach in 1976 that enabled the network to correctly forecast a Jimmy Carter victory in the highly competitive 1976 Wisconsin Democratic Presidential Primary after NBC and ABC had jumped the gun and called the race for early frontrunner, Congressman Morris Udall of Arizona, worked against the network four years later election night with the Carter-Reagan race.  Walter Cronkite, calling his last presidential election, bowed out on an embarrassing note.  Not wanting to risk an early misfire, as occurred with its competitors in 1976, CBS withheld its call.  It did not put its seal on Ronald Reagan's decisive victory over Jimmy Carter until the incumbent president, influenced by the other two network calls, had conceded defeat.<br />Plissner gives his own account of the rollicking Dan Rather live interview of George Bush during the 1988 primary campaign.  Plissner finds it highly improbable that media claims of CBS planning to ambush Vice-President are valid.  He maintains never having heard anything to this effect, leaving the impression that, had such a ploy been in the offing, he would have known.  Plissner also notes that, given media concern about Bush's potential involvement in the Iran-Contra arms for hostages scandal, any responsible reporter would have questioned him in that area, as Rather did, arousing ire and prompting complaints on the Vice-President's part.<br />Another point Plissner covers is the successful safety ploy on the part of the major parties to lock up party presidential nominations as far in advance of the convention as possible.  He notes the unfortunate consequences of the process, a crowded early primary season followed by dull conventions and ennui until the fall battle has hopefully awakened citizen interest.	2002-01-16
US	52389304	R3BEBUHRU8C3SO	0375702296	993234858	King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A Symbol and his Time	David Remnick's biography of Muhammad Ali covers not just the career of one extraordinary fighter, but the widely encompassing sweep of his historical time.  The book begins by sharply examining heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson and the unique qualities he brought to the America of his day, a quiet, soft spoken man who carried himself with dignity.  Remnick then traces the rocky road to the championship for Sonny Liston, which was achieved after a stop at a federal penitentiary.  Liston longed for acclaim from the public, and hoped he would get it after dispatching Patterson in their 1962 title fight in Chicago.  A restless, brooding man, Liston would move from St. Louis, to Philadephia, then west to Denver and ultimately Las Vegas.  <br />Ali's brash behavior in demanding a shot at Liston's title was part calculated strategy, part show business, boosting his  recognition level all the while, building on the name value he began achieving after winning a gold medal in the light heavyweight class at the 1960 Rome Olympics.  Eventually his loud bravado would convince Liston that he was actually crazy.<br />When Ali won the title from Liston in 1964 in Miami Beach many boxing authorities and fans thought his win a fluke.  He then defeated Liston in a controversial rematch in Lewiston, Maine, a one round knockout many believed resulted from Liston lying down on the job.  Remnick disagrees, quoting Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee and others in accepting that Liston happened to walk into a well-placed blow that traveled a short distance, but was substantial enough to accomplish its objective.  Remnick also points out that Liston bore the fate of reaching the title after his prime, and might well have achieved a longer, more far reaching destiny as champion had the fates been kinder.<br />The high point of Remnick's dramatic account of a highly colorful American figure arrives when he tackles Ali's refusal to be drafted into the Army.  Remnick does an excellent job of presenting and analyzing with sharp critical intelligence the forces at work during the sixties who admired Ali's stand along with those who opposed it, some of whom bitterly hated him.  He does an excellent job of describing how African-Americans reacted to Ali as a fighter and a man, particularly at the critical moment when he stood up to political forces who sought to pressure him to be drafted into the Army during the highly controversial Vietnam War.<br />This is a book that provides a sociological panorama of Ali and his time.  As such, this broad landscape is an invaluable work which enhances reader understanding of a controversial period of American history.	2002-01-14

Voters were so turned off that participation plummeted to 49%.  This was the campaign where Willie Horton and the Pledge of Allegiance dominated.  The book's subtitle of &quot;The Trivial Pursuit of the Presidency&quot; was accordingly apt.<br />When the media-orchestrated campaign of Roger Ailes, known as &quot;the mudmeister,&quot; along with cohort Lee Atwater, who had been trained by none other than Richard Nixon, reached fever pitch, and a &quot;news event&quot; consisted of Republican nominee, Vice-President George H.W. Bush, visiting a flag factory, Dan Rather and his CBS news cohorts refused to cover the event.  CBS explained to the Republicans that if they wanted serious coverage then the campaign needed to get serious and talk about substantive policy matters rather than hide behind the flag and expect to receive prime time attention.  Voters in other states envied the Nevada prerogative of voters, which permitted the alternative of the truly turned off, a vote for &quot;None of the above,&quot; which turned out to be a popular category.<br />Germond and Witcover present a detailed account of a campaign where glossy imagery and mud slinging obscured the real issues, beginning with rising American debt, which would continue to burgeon after Bush's victory over Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.  A highlight of the Republican's campaign was his  promise at his party's New Orleans convention of, &quot;Read my lips!  No new taxes!&quot;  This was an irresponsible promise in view of the pervasive reality that economic circumstances vary and policies need to reflect those current circumstances.	2002-01-14

Arthur Mr. Schlesinger Jr., a former John F. Kennedy presidential aide and speechwriter to Democratic presidential nominee Adlai E. Stevenson, has crafted in highly readable fashion one of the premier studies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's groundbreaking first term.<br />Schlesinger creates an enduring portrait of America's Depression president by presenting the challenges he faced during a tumultuous period and revealing how he surmounted them.  Schlesinger cites Roosevelt's great triumphs such as passage of the Social Security Act in 1935 and the Rural Electrification Act, which brought badly needed power to farm communities leveled by the Great Depression.  Schlesinger also provides a fascinating segment on the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority.<br />In order to continue in his battle against the ravages of economic hardship, Roosevelt needed to be reelected.  Despite the fact that perilous conditions continued, which Roosevelt fought to surmount, his progressive agenda enabled him to triumph over forces ranging from Senator Huey Long of Louisiana, the Union for Social Justice on the right with Congressman William Lemke, Father Coughlin, and Gerald L.K. Smith, Norman Thomas of the Socialist Party, and on the far left Earl Browder, perpetual presidential nominee of the American Communist Party.  FDR boldly challenged Americans to overcome doubt, develop confidence, and work toward a better future by pulling together during a time of great adversity.  <br />Roosevelt took his message to the voters in November.  He received the most tumultuous landslide victory in history by winning every state but Maine and Vermont while accumulating better than 61% of the vote in defeating the Republican nominee, Governor Alf M. Landon of Kansas.	2002-01-12

Instead, he seeks to open up a path of inquiry wherein those readers investigate for themselves and draw their own conclusions.<br />One of the world's foremost linguists, Chomsky explains how language has been used to serve the interest of the individual presenting a message. This tendency has been enhanced manyfold with the inroads of technology, from radio on to television, to the current period of cable TV and a never ending procession of talking heads seeking to entertain more than intellectually enlighten. Chomsky illustrates how Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America public relations campaign sought to manipulate minds through the use of supercharged terminology in a manner that he contends would have left British political visionary George Orwell roaring with laughter.<br />A thorough reading of this work attunes one to how Chomsky approaches his research, and how those interested in researching important political topics might proceed on their own. On the subject of international politics, particularly military actions, Chomsky relies significantly on Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. He devotes strong emphasis to the East Timor tragedy and the appallingly insignificant attention it received from the mainstream media. Chomsky also laments how little attention was given to the assassination of Bishop Romero in El Salvador compared to any putatively comparable events occurring in nations of the former Soviet bloc or Cuba.<br />Chomsky leaves no doubt that he is his own person. Contrary to a criticism made of him that he is an ideologue first and always without a consciousness toward pragmatic political considerations, Chomsky makes the point that voting considerations need to be oriented toward a practical result.  A decision can be made to support a particular candidate not because Chomsky holds a basic affinity toward him, but because a practical goal can be realized by supporting that individual.<br />Chomsky's encyclopedic mind and affinity for research are communicated impressively in this series of interviews with Barsmaniam.  He communicates the need for the interested political participant to observe the entire picture after undertaking research.	2002-01-12

Lawrence in Arabia. In David Lean's great film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; a facsimile of Thomas was presented with the journalist played by Arthur Kennedy who came from New York to cover the great desert warrior's exploits.<br />In addition to providing readers with a firsthand look at the enigmatic, always colorful Lawrence, Thomas also gives us a good look at the geographical milieu of an ancient and fascinating land. He also provides excellent information on tribal leaders, complete with illuminating thumbnail sketches, such as his portrait of the fabled legend in his own time, Auda, who, when told that his false teeth had come from the country he hated, Turkey, smashed them with a rock and was compelled to take his meals through a straw for two weeks.<br />After having learned a great deal about Lawrence elsewhere, what I found truly unique about Thomas' biographical study was his analysis of the desert warrior's brilliant strategy of bringing disparate tribes together for a common goal.  He stressed to tribal leaders, making proper pragmatically individualized approaches, how important it was to overcome Turkey's Ottoman Empire in Arabia.  Lawrence emphasized that disunity had been their major stumbling block in failing to meet their objectives as Arabs.  Lawrence's diplomatic skills resulted in at least a temporary unity, with even the headstrong inidivdualist, Auda, joining the cohesive effort to overthrow the Ottoman regime.	2002-01-10

As a film historian who frequently analyzes directors and their films, I found this volume extremely valuable.  It gives one a perfect opportunity to quickly cover the scope of a director's entire career, reading quotes from the director as well as opinions of prominent critics about significant films from that individual's career.  <br />&quot;World Film Directors&quot; also provides a film historian or fan with the opportunity to enhance his or her perspective of a particular movie by receiving important information on the making of the film, as well as the director's view of the subject matter, as well as opinions of reviewers.<br />What impressed me most about this work was the exhaustive manner in which it covered film history from 1890-1945.  While the breadth is spectacular, the book never bogs down into trivia or fact recitation for its own sake.  The directors' lives and careers, as well as their significant films, are covered with the microscope applied to substance rather than minutiae.	2002-01-09

Some of the anecdotal information, as stated by reviewers, is incorrect, based on relying on Rizzuto's memory over events being recalled many years later.  The interesting aspect of the book is looking into the mindset of one of the truly great shortstops to play the game, who also was a part of some of the greatest teams ever to step on a big league diamond.<br />Rizzuto pulls no punches when it comes to his Yankee manager Casey Stengel, who turned thumbs down on Rizzuto after a tryout when he was earlier manager of the Dodgers.  Rizzuto questions some of Stengel's unconventional strategy, such as using Mickey Mantle as a leadoff hitter.  Some of the patented Stengel humor comes across nonetheless, such as his comment that every time junkball pitcher Ed Lopat worked for the Yankees people would come out of the stands and ask the manager for a chance to pitch on the theory that if the pitches looked that slow (and deceptively easy to hit) that they could do the job as well.<br />Rizzuto gives a lot of credit to the Yankee pitching staff in helping achieve the 5 straight World Series titles.  Baseball historian Roger Kahn, who covered the Dodger beat in the fifties, reasoned that Brooklyn had a narrow edge when it came to matching up with Yankee regulars, but that the difference came with the pitching.  Rizzuto reveals how wrong the Cleveland Indians were to let Allie Reynolds go on the erroneous pretext that he just didn't have the heart or competitive instinct to make it to the top rung.  Tell that to the hitters who faced him during his Yankee days!  <br />Along with writing about the other brilliant Yankee starters of the period, Whitey Ford and the aforementioned Lopat, and throwing bouquets to reliever Bob Kuzava, who made a habit of excelling at World Series time, Rizzuto speculates on what might have been if the top brass had not traded Vic Raschi, New York's other celebrated starter, to the St. Louis Cardinals after the '53 season.  The Yankees chalked up 103 wins in 1954 but finished in second place eight games behind the Cleveland Indians.  Rizzuto speculates that, had Raschi remained with the Yankees, the team might have been able to extend its remarkable record for one season or beyond following the 5 world titles in a row.  This makes for interesting speculation, the idea that this remarkable string could possibly have continued at least a little longer.	2002-01-08

What is refreshing, along with his basic candor, is that despite his enormous success he retains a humble and highly humane touch.<br />Some of the most humorous anecdotes of &quot;Name Above the Title&quot; involve madcap, always colorful Columbia boss Harry Cohn, who took his Gower Street studio from the ranks of &quot;Poverty Row&quot; to the that of a giant.  Capra helped significantly with box office smashes such as &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;,&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; and &quot;Meet John Doe.&quot;  It took awhile, but the Capra film which has soared to top spot in the hearts and minds of the public was the 1946 release starring Jimmy Stewart, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot;  The star was so enthused about the story that he pitched it personally to Capra after driving over to his house.  Capra relates the time that he begged Cohn not to drop a struggling young cartoonist from the Columbia payroll, predicting that he would be sorry.  Capra was right as the cartoonist was a young, meek Iowa farm boy named Walt Disney.<br />One of Capra's great contributions was directing and producing the excellent World War Two documentary series &quot;Why We Fight.&quot;  He tells about being called into the office of Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, who asked him to undertake the project.  &quot;But I've never done a documentary!&quot; a surprised Capra replied.  Marshall pointed out that he had never run an army before either, and that the American way during the critical war period was for citizens to learn jobs with which they were previously unfamiliar.  Capra saw Marshall's logic and the rest is history.<br />This autobiography is fascinating enough for the interesting information about Capra's life.  What makes it even better is that you are reading the revelations of a good man who did his best to instill positive values into his films, and to help in his distinctive way to make America a better country.ugh for the interesting information about Capra's life.

A professor who specializes in media-oriented activity, Miller focuses on George Bush the Younger, comparing and contrasting reality with carefully designed, highly expensive, and carefully orchestrated image creation.<br />I was particularly indebted to Miller for what is the best analysis of an important event from Bush the Elder's campaign for the 1988 Republican nomination en route to an ultimate victory in the November election against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.  Bush, having been coached in advance by media guru Roger Ailes, now news director at Fox Television, was interviwed live on CBS News by anchorman Dan Rather.  It was on Ailes' insistence that the interview be done live.  Ailes' stated fear was that CBS would doctor the interview if it ran subsequently on tape.  Miller is the only analyst that I am aware of who perceived Bush's performance as an &quot;ad hominem attack on Rather.&quot;  With Ailes encouraging from the sidelines in the manner of an excited boxing manager, Bush responded to Rather's attempts to gain insight into Bush's role in the Iran Contra Scandal by revealing Rather's highly publicized studio walkout in a state of pique after a tennis tournament ran late, and directly into his news time.  Miller saw the combativeness as a grandstanding attempt to display machismo while dodging a topic Bush should have tackled as it directly related to the presidential race and Bush's potential ability to function as the nation's Commander-in-Chief.<br />Miller is on solid ground in stating that, with commericial advertising such a huge factor, networks are impeded from supplying the kind of hard-nosed analysis required to enhance citizen understanding.  He points to alternative information vehicles such as The Nation, Mother Jones, Slate.com and Salon.com as vitally needed sources to broaden understanding through needed critiques of the political system.	2002-01-04

The breadth of McCullough's research was so thorough and his presentation so affecting that the reader concludes by feeling that he or she knew Harry Truman personally.<br />McCullough traces Truman's roots in rural Missouri.  He cites as a Truman milestone the World War One period when a bookish young man with notably poor vision distinguished himself as Captain of a National Guard unit.  Ultimately Truman would rise to become a county judge.  From there it was on to the U.S. Senate, the vice-presidency, and the assumption of the presidency upon Franklin Delano Roosevelt's death.  McCullough reveals Truman's strong independence and unflinching courage.  He had been a protege of Missouri political boss Tom Pendergast, who ultimately spent time in prison and was a highly controversial figure.  When Pendergast died Truman attended his funeral, despite advice to the contrary, explaining that the former boss had always been helpful to him and that their relationship was absent of even a taint of corruption.  Truman was tapped by FDR for the vice-presidency after achieving national attention as an independent investigator who uncovered government waste in chairing the Truman Committee.<br />A major element of Truman's storybook life was what pundits refer to as the greatest upset in presidential politics, the incumbent president's stunning victory over Governor Thomas E. Dewey in 1948.  McCullough colorfully recounts the train stop toward the end of Truman's whistlestop campaign when adviser Clark Clifford left the train and bought the latest news magazines, which carried predictions of leading political experts throughout the country.  When a crestfallen Clifford observed that every political writer consulted predicted a Dewey victory, the adviser sought to keep the news from Truman, who shrewdly recognized what his adviser was doing.  Instead of becoming gloomy or upset, Truman, after reading the predictions, replied crisply, &quot;I never thought those guys knew what they were talking about.&quot;  Truman's confidence proved infectious as he scored a brilliant victory, proving the so-called experts wrong.  McCullough captures Truman's uniqueness and stern mettle.  Under his administration the UN came into being, NATO was created, the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan became reality, the U.S. headed a UN coalition fighting Communist aggression in Korea, and the Berlin Airlift was successfully achieved.  It was a period of abundant foreign policy accomplishments achieved under the plain spoken man from Independence, Missouri.	2002-01-03

He packs the same wallop in his book &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; the basis for the powerful 1980 film which was directed by Martin Scorsese and earned Robert De Niro an Oscar for Best Actor.<br />La Motta paints a brutally vivid picture of a youngster and young man growing up in a brutal Bronx jungle.  The fighter they called &quot;The Bronx Bull&quot; writes about seeing rats in the cellar of the tenament where he grew up that were the size of cats.    The neighborhood in which he grew up was so tough that he had thousands of fights, explaining that by the time he laced on gloves and became a boxer such conflict had become totally routine.  To La Motta a fight was as commonplace as anyone else brushing their teeth, a simple, elementary part of life.  He writes about his early life of crime, including the beating of one man he thought he had killed.  In perhaps the most dramatic sequence of the book he reveals how he had lived in morbid fear of being apprehended for murder and in guilt for the act itself, after which he was shocked when the man he was convinced he had killed surfaces.  Unaware that La Motta was his attacker, the man surfaces in Detroit to wish the fighter luck as he prepares for his winning title bout against champion Marcel Cerdan of France.  The man explains that he was hurt badly but finally recovered, and is in town to wish someone from his old neighborhood luck in his title pursuit. <br />The raw power of the lightning narrative, along with its brutally realistic truth, makes &quot;Raging Bull&quot; one of the all- time great sports books, a true American classic.	2002-01-01

When Bern, who married MGM's blonde screen bombshell Jean Harlow, died of what was ruled a suicide, a skeptical Marx began sleuthing, unwilling to believe the conclusion that had been reached.<br />&quot;Deadly Illusions&quot; represents Marx's effort to solve what has become a longstanding mystery in Hollywood, with many unconvinced, as was the MGM story editor, that Bern had died of a self-administered gunshot wound.  Marx concludes that MGM executive Eddie Mannix, operating as studio boss L.B. Mayer's troubleshooter, rigged the suicide attempt to cover up a dark secret about Bern's past, which resulted in his being murdered.  To reveal more would be to give away the suspense which should be the reader's discovery.  <br />This is a book that depicts Hollywood during a glorious period of productivity.  Marx was a busy on the scene participant and makes you as a reader feel that you were an intimate part of it as well.	2001-12-29

Little did I know about Todd's involvement with mobster Lucky Luciano and abounding speculation stemming therefrom until reading &quot;Hot Toddy&quot; and exploring Andy Edmonds' interesting hypothesis.<br />The book is written in the form of a quasi-novel with dialogue between Todd and Luciano, as well as lengthy character sketches of both major players.  They loom as fascinating characters for entirely different reasons, a fun loving film star and a ruthless, homicidal gangland boss who takes no prisoners.  <br />An interesting explanatory element of Edmonds' hypothesis is the involvement of corrupt Los Angeles District Attorney Buron Fitts, who was allegedly controlled by Luciano and other gangland elements.  When the no nonsense Todd sought to reveal  Luciano's machinations to the D.A. he supposedly expressed interest in what she had to say.  Todd was killed a short time thereafter.<br />Lonnie Anderson did a good job of playing Todd in the made for television movie &quot;Hot Toddy&quot; based on Edmonds' book.  It closely follows the book.	2001-12-29

David Halberstam poses an interesting question in his entertaining book about the 1949 American League pennant race.  Did the Red Sox violate the cardinal rule, &quot;Never rile a giant,&quot; when they descended on Yankee Stadium for the final 2 games of the season?<br />Birdie Tebbetts, Boston's ever needling catcher, told Phil Rizzuto early in the first game between the contending teams with the pennant on the line that the Red Sox planned on pitching the new college kid they had just called up in the next day's game.  Rizzuto went back to the Yankee bench and proceeded to fire up his team.  The Yankees believed that the visiting Sox, who came in 1 game up on the Bronx Bombers and needed but a single win to sew up the pennant, were taking them lightly.  The Yanks won the first game and the pennant was on the line the following day.<br />Halberstam then fastens on a controversy that will never be resolved, and which remains a sore point to veteran Red Sox fans.  Joe McCarthy, the same skipper who guided the Yankees to so many pennants, and the Cubs before that, started Tennessean Ellis Kinder in the final game.  Kinder had experienced brilliant success against the Yankees that season.  Behind 1-0, McCarthy lifted Kinder for a pinchhitter.  The Yankees then went on to a 5-0 lead before the Red Sox staged a ninth inning rally, but fell short 5-3 as the Yanks won the AL pennant and went on to defeat a strong Brooklyn Dodger team in 5 games in the World Series.<br />The Red Sox were so furious with McCarthy, a manager who achieved the highest winning career percentage in baseball history, that an argument erupted on the train ride back to Boston.  The players were convinced that, had Kinder not been lifted, the Sox would have found a way to win.  They believed they would still have rallied for 3 runs and that Kinder would have whitewashed the home team the rest of the way for a 3-1 victory.  McCarthy was eventually dismissed, never to manage again after a brilliant career.<br />Another interesting part of Halberstam's book is the look into the quiet mystery man of baseball, Joe Dimaggio, and his courageous and determined comeback.  With the Yankees behind the Red Sox in the standings as Joltin' Joe was sidelined by an injury, he unleashed furious determination to come back with little time to spare.  Halberstam describes how he painfully cut his hands after lengthy batting practices following his layoff before the calluses returned.  With Dimaggio back in the lineup the Yankees staged a comeback, forcing the final 2 game showdown for the flag in Yankee Stadium.<br />A touching element of Halberstam's book is the focus on how the parents of Joe and Dom Dimaggio, centerfielders on the Yankees and Red Sox respectively, behaved diplomatically.  The proud parents from San Francisco saw that love and attention was showered equally on their famous ballplayer sons, and that they showed no favoritism regarding the Yankees and Red Sox.	2001-12-29

She writes in the same kind of snappy, economical style that she recommends.  To veer from this course, she warns, is to risk an attention distraction or, fatally, turning off the reader altogether.<br />Jennifer's &quot;500 ways&quot; are the various tips from the trade about what interests script readers as well as what turns them off.  She cautions about long lead-ins or narrative description that makes readers think you are trying to direct as well as write a scenario.  She lets you know immediately that there is an oceanic expanse separating the long narrative descriptions of characters in novels as opposed to the exigencies of the screen craft, where pictures are worth so many words.  In this field the dialogue and scenes containing them must be brief, while the story must follow a dramatic forward thrust from Fade In to Fade Out that keeps readers interested and involved.  Lerch explains that readers have short attention spans due to the pressures of handling long and steady volumes of work.  It is therefore essential to keep your writing staccato, your characters spelled out briefly, and your scenes following an intriguing progression that keeps your readers interested and on board until Fade Out.	2001-12-29

The important element arising from 9-11 in the total perspective is saluting the unfolding legacy developing from those events as they are projected forward toward posterity, never forgetting the sacrifices of those who died and those who risked their lives to assist.     It was a day and a period for coming together, for fellowship, for doing for others.  This book serves as an important tool in preserving that legacy.<br />Selfish concerns must be forgotten when an event of this magnitude occurs.  This is the type of period when Americans must respond to the challenge, to unite.  This book captures that unification process in action.  These photos are reminiscent for their profound meaning of those taken following the deaths of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Martin Luther King.  A great nation reveals its best, and displays its unifying core, in the wake of tragedy.	2001-12-29

David McGowan endeavors to expose willing Americans to the global picture.  Relying significantly on reports from Amnesty International and statements from sources outside the sanitized mainstream, McGowan lays out his case.  From global warning to crime and punishment, McGowan cites sources who possess the bold integrity to criticize in the expectation of helping build a stronger America.<br />The Jeanne Kirkpatrick who mouthed the famous &quot;Blame America first&quot; quote would greet this book with revulsion.  So will others who like to sugar coat the American political scene with Reagan style &quot;Morning in America&quot; pieties and admonitions to citizens to either &quot;Love America or leave it!&quot;  McGowan believes, as do many of us, that to build a stronger country we must initially face up to problems that require corrective action.  It would be nice to breathe cleaner air and provide greater numbers of Americans with a chance to live at a healthier, more prosperous level.  We must pursue these goals rather than live in an insulated society devoid of critical commentary where people mouth pious platitudes to the status quo.	2001-12-28

Priestley's classic drama &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; has a sturdy allegorical ring that reminds me of another great British author's work, &quot;A Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan.  The Birling family, prominent society figures of Brunley, a North Midlands town, are celebrating the engagement of their daughter Sheila to the son of a prominent local family when a man calling himself Inspector Goole arrives unannounced.<br />Whatever triumphal joy they earlier felt is soon washed away as the Inspector informs them that a young woman by the name of Eva Smith has just died in the local infirmary, a painful suicide victim prompted by taking disinfectant.  Gradually he draws everyone in the household into the picture.  All are implicated in the tragic downfall leading to Eva's suicide.  Mr. Birling fired her after she was a leader in a strike at his factory, resulting from her asking for a fair weekly wage.  His daugher Sheila caused a dismissal from Eva's next job at a department store in a jealous rage over the young woman's good looks.  Sheila's husband to be Gerald found a room for her temporarily, had an affair with her, then let her go.  Eric Birling, Sheila's brother, impregnated her, after which she sought help from the charity committee headed by Mrs. Birling, who coldly spurned her.<br />The only two members of the Birling household who feel appropriately contrite are Eric and Sheila.  When it appears that the incident might be a hoax the others are relieved, ignoring their abominable behavior toward the girl.<br />Just when it appears that they might all be in the clear, and it is learned that the mysterious Inspector Goole was no more than an apparition or hoax of some kind, a call is received that a girl has indeed died in the infirmary from ingesting disinfectant and that an Inspector is on his way to question the Birling family!  And at a time when Mr. Birling expects to be offered a knighthood, no less!<br />The dialogue is crisp and the mysterious Inspector Goole forces the family to look for once beyond their own selfish interests and contemplate the tragic consequences of conduct stemming from their ruthless mindset.  &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; reads brilliantly and plays mesmerizingly until the final curtain.  It has been playing for better than a decade at London's West End, where I have seen it 3 times and intend to see it more times in the future.  Its timeless message remains as vital now as when it premiered starring Alec Guinness and Ralph Richardson in 1946.	2001-12-28

It serves as the first installment leading up to the period after Nixon took over as president in 1969 to the conclusion of our Southeast Asian military involvement, which Berman encompasses in his recently published, &quot;No Peace, No Honor.&quot;<br />The book is a necessary primer on the &quot;what might have been&quot; aspects of a policy that, like a runaway freight train, developed a pattern and trail of its own, leaving Americans from policymakers on down groping for answers.  One observes a Lyndon Johnson, a master of domestic politics and known for his ability to put together compromises to secure needed bread and butter objectives, caught dumbfounded, feeling helpless in an area concerning which he had no expertise.  Johnson fell into the trap of rightist Republican thinking of the fifties, which saw Communism as an international monolith.  Johnson became convinced that America's survival was at stake in a small Asian nation some ten thousand miles away.  He embraced the domino theory, believing that Vietnam constituted a potentially critical loss that would propel thenceforth to an accelerating series of defeats for America.  <br />At a time when Johnson needed valuable input from a State Department strategic hand who saw Vietnam from a balanced international perspective, George Ball, the one operative with a broad European portfolio, who advised the president not to get trapped in Vietnamese quicksand, was outranked by his boss, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, as well as hawkish Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  As a result, Ball, who had listened to French President Charles De Gaulle's warnings of the dangers of an extended Vietnam military involvement, saw his advice spurned as the Rusk-McNamara tandem prevailed.<br />Meanwhile speculation continues over what President Kennedy might have ultimately done had helived.  One thing was certain.  Had Kennedy, like Johnson, decided to escalate American involvement, he would have made the decision basically on his own.  Kennedy used Rusk more as an administrator since foreign policy was one of his major areas of interest, unlike the case with Johnson, who, from Berman's and other accounts, deferred heavily to Rusk and McNamara.	2001-12-27

Two others were his excellent series in Time about Berlin in the rise of Hitler along with &quot;Going Crazy,&quot; a brilliant study of psychoanalysis with analyses of some interesting case histories of individuals who were treated for psychiatric difficulties.  &quot;City of Nets&quot; explores the fabled city of lights and dreams during one of its most memorable decades.  In addition to receiving all kinds of interesting tidbits about Rita Hayworth's tempestuous marriage to Orson Welles and Robert Mitchum's time spent in a California honor farm on a marijuana possession charge that would ultimately be expunged, Friedrich also provides the broader picture of a town thrown into turmoil and confusion during the period following the war.<br />Friedrich gives a brilliant account of the tragic blacklist period.  As one who has studied this period closely as a historian, I was impressed by the breadth of the author's scope as a researcher.  German playwright Bertolt Brecht is colorfully displayed.  His offbeat intelligence and unconventional demeanor completely astounded House Un-American Activities Committee members as they sought to interrogate him.  Long after the author of &quot;Mother Courage&quot;, &quot;Galileo&quot; and many other plays had returned to his native East Germany, committee members and others were still trying to figure him out.  Friedrich relates the incident when Charles Laughton threw a wild tantrum at the Coronet Theater as he was rehearsing for the Los Angeles premiere of Brecht's &quot;Galileo.&quot;  Another interesting character sketch provided by Friedrich is that of Austrian emigre Billy Wilder, who fled Hitler's Germany and became a major figure in films, first as a writer, then as a director-writer.<br />The anecdotes and richness of the character portraits transpose the reader back to Hollywood in the forties.  As revealed, it was a truly fascinating, wildly unpredictable place during a pivotal period of American history.	2001-12-27

The novel contains the biting edge of the best hard-boiled detective fiction of the forties' period when the book was written.  Red Bailey from the book becomes Jeff Bailey in the film, with Robert Mitchum perfectly cast as the tough, laconic, shrewd loner whose common sense deserts him when confronted by the combustible noir brunette charms of femme fatale Jane Greer.  The book hits on the same cylinders, unremarkable in that Homes adapted it to the screen.  Bailey does everything he can to forge a new life away from Greer, including finding a sweet, homespun girlfriend who is the diammetrical opposite of the ruthless femme fatale, but to no avail.  He can never reject Kathie's enticements, despite his awareness of her treachery.  The book is strong on hard-bitten narrative and those who like the work of Chandler and Hammett should appreciate &quot;Build My Gallows High.&quot;<br />The British newspaper The Guardian strikes the correct note concerning the book, &quot;Intermingling obsessive love, crime and betrayal ... the film's razor-sharp dialogue is mostly already there in the novel and an even more tortuous plot.&quot;  Curl up on a dark, spooky evening, begin reading, and enjoy.	2001-12-26

The momentum generated from their courageous Washington Post articles brought Woodward and Bernstein fame and fortune, Pulitzers, and helped save our democracy at a time when President Nixon was trashing the U.S. Constitution and taking America down the dangerous slippery road to dictatorial tyranny.<br />It all started with an event at the Watergate Complex later referred to by Nixon as &quot;a third rate burglary.&quot;  The more research Woodward and Bernstein did into a story Woodward thought initially was a routine burglary, the greater their astonishment as the list of contacts and involved characters reached ever higher into the top levels of the government, into ultimately the White House itself.  Before long plea bargain deals were being made, more operatives were talking, and a Senate Watergate Committee was formed headed by Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina, who became an immediate household name as the televised hearings generated the most interest to Americans since the McCarthy Committee hearings two decades earlier.<br />If you want to read a cloak and dagger story truer and every bit as fascinating as those penned by the finest writers, this is a book you will want to read.  Thirty years later &quot;All The President's Men&quot; retains its timeliness as we read about incredible stories of corruption and double dealings in the political world.  After digesting this book it is much easier to evaluate corruption once it is observed by vigilant citizens.<br />William Hare	2001-12-26

Cory's dieting tips come from the latest information from the Food and Drug Administration along with the top think tanks in the health field worldwide.  As for her exercise tips, I found the weight training information highly valuable since I am into that form of activity.  She stresses a practical approach to both dieting and exercise, and the tips are beneficial to anyone concerned about staying fit at whatever age or level of activity, from the professional athlete to people exercising to maintain good health.  I liked the fact that Cory's book was devoid of the kind of radical, pie in the sky, results promised instantly approach to diet taken by some authors in recent years.  The accent remains on the practical at all stages.  Cory tells her readers frankly that results will come only when motivated people are willing to exert effort to help themselves by following sensible approaches.<br />Cory Everson is one of the great female athletes of her generation.

In the typical Nixon fashion, design was preeminent over ultimate reality as he heralded the agreement ending U.S. participation in the nation's most controversial war with the glorious phrase, &quot;Peace With Honor.&quot;  <br />&quot;No Peace, No Honor&quot; is the logical sequel to Larry Berman's earlier penetrating work, &quot;Planning a Tragedy,&quot; which was a fascinating look inside the Johnson Administration and the mindset which brought about America's entry into the Vietnam conflict.  Robert McNamara, despite his earlier assurances, proved to be a naive administrator, making mistake upon mistake in forcing America into an ever deepening hawkish posture.  The wise counsel of State Department operative George Ball, who provided the beneficial hindsight input of French president Charles DeGaulle, whose country fought a war in Indo China between 1946 and 1954, was unfortunately spurned.<br />With Johnson gone and the Nixon Administration taking over in January of 1969, the scene is set for Berman's latest work.  Taking advantage of recently declassified government documents, Berman presents a chaotic scene in which Nixon and Kissinger seek to find a way out of the Vietnam morass without conveying the impression that the U.S. was running out on an ally and leaving it vulnerably exposed to a successful Communist insurgency.  Despite ferocious bombing, Nixon was ultimately confronted with a situation wherein public support for the war in America had reached its lowest level while his anticipated strategy of helping build Vietnam's fighting forces into a team formidable enough to hold off the insurgency from the North had notably failed.  As a result, Nixonsought to convince Americans that the agreement he was able to achieve embodied &quot;Peace With Honor&quot; when Communist troops remained in place in the South, prepared to finish the job and achieve a unified Vietnam.  Debate had persisted over the years over whether Nixon and Kissinger were aware of what ultimately would transpire, and that the agreement signed and put into place was nothing other than a facade meant to disguise an ultimate result of which they were well aware.  The documents unearthed by Berman demonstrate an awareness of Nixon and Kissinger of the tragic nature of circumstances and the inevitability of a Communist triumph.<br />William Hare	2001-12-24

Some contended that the early departure stemmed from the Belgian government's eagerness to confront Kissinger for alleged &quot;crimes&quot; in the overthrow of the Chilean government of President Allende culminating with the legally elected leader's assassination.  European interest has dramatically intensified in recent months regarding an expressed need for Kissinger to be compelled to explain his actions regarding Chile and other controversial matters.  The controversial former U.S. secretary of state seeks to quell such inquiries through a nervous silence, hoping such concerns will dissipate through the passage of time.   <br />Into the scene comes Christopher Hitchens, who makes a case in this book for Kissinger standing trial for past foreign policy conduct.  He makes the case for Kissinger's involvement in the overthrow and assassination of Allende in Chile, but does not stop there.  Hitchens also presents his reasons why Kissinger should be held accountable for a coup and an assassination in Bangladesh, and for the deaths of East Timoreans seeking freedom and incurring widespread loss of life at the hands of Indonesian President Suharto's forces.  Hitchens also implicates Kissinger in the 1974 Cyprus tragedy and also hones in on actions in which he was involved as Nixon's special national security operative and secretary of state during the Vietnam War.  He cites Telford Taylor, an American prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, as stating that U.S. policy was subject to prosecution by invoking the prevailing Nuremberg criteria, relating to ferocious bombing assaults which Taylor and Hitchens believe violated the Geneva Codes.<br />Hitchens presents his case with compelling vigor, asserting that, in a world where the United States is seeking vigorous prosecution in the World Court against Slobodan Milosevic and his cohorts for criminal conduct in the former Yugoslavia, a Henry Kissinger should also be held accountable for his activities.<br />William Hare	2001-12-24

Joe McGinniss managed to sneak aboard the Nixon for President campaign without having his main purpose discovered, that of writing up what he observed.  Had Ailes or any of his underlings known, McGinniss would assuredly have been instantly dismissed.  Had candidate Nixon ever learned the response would, almost assuredly, have been apoplectic, given Nixon's all-consuming hatred for reporters of anything but a fawning bent.<br />The book is humorous in many respects, while the overall result of the effort reported, selling a candidate who would ultimately become the only U.S. president to resign in disgrace, is anything but funny.  &quot;The Selling of the President&quot; gives us an indication of how far we have plummeted in presidential campaigns where spin control dominates over critical substance.  For instance, just twenty years after Nixon's 1968 victory over Hubert Humphrey, George Bush was elected by exploiting the American flag and a Massachusetts rapist named Willie Horton.  The 1984 campaign of President Ronald Reagan stressed the theme of &quot;Morning in America&quot; despite prolific evidence that the temporary prosperity proudly exploited resulted from a credit card spending effect linked to an irresponsible tax cut which  ultimately left America in serious debt.<br />The ultimate value of McGinniss' book is learning just how cynically Ailes and the spin control brigade seeks to manipulate American voters.  To readers of George Orwell the pattern will contain a distinctly familiar ring.<br />William Hare	2001-12-23

Nixon)	Books	5	38	38	N	N	Narrative History at its Most Vivid	One of my inspirations to become a historian stemmed from reading Theodore H. White's milestone Pulitzer Prize-winning narrative history of the exciting 1960 presidential race between Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice-President Richard M. Nixon, &quot;The Making of the President -- 1960.&quot;  The big reason why I enjoyed and was so profoundly influenced by this milestone work was that it helped popularize the narrative historical approach, which merges the character-building drama of a great novel with the march of history.  I found it infinitely preferable to the dry, fact-oriented textbooks I was so frequently compelled to wade through as a student.  Almost assuredly, White used this style because it had become comfortable to him in the profession in which his writing career was launched -- journalism.  He was a man who knew how to get a story and flesh out the fascinating aspects of the people he interviewed en route.<br />White certainly had a compelling drama in his midst in 1960, with John Kennedy seeking to become the first Roman Catholic ever to attain the presidency and Richard Nixon seeking to extend an eight year, Republican two term rule.  As in the best of dramas, contrasts abound between the contestants.  Kennedy came from a wealthy Boston family while Nixon was a middle class Southern Californian.  The man of wealth was championed by liberals and unionists while the middle class Nixon was favored by conservatives of those of privilege, who feared that Kennedy and his Democratic Party followers were too radical for their tastes.  Whereas Kennedy was a social mixer and, to a certain extent, an extrovert, Nixon was a solitary man uncomfortable around people.<br />Having experienced a cliffhanger presidential election in 2000, interested political readers and students of history can draw many correlations between Bush vs. Gore and the nail-biting race of 1960.  In fact, the 1960 cliffhanger saw winner Kennedy prevail with a popular vote margin almost five times less the better than half million vote difference between Gore and electoral college winner Bush.<br />White, having decided that Kennedy was likely to prevail, was able to position himself at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannisport on election night.  As a result he was able to furnish all kinds of dramatic, firsthand information about the reactions of Kennedy, his family members, and close political operatives.<br />William Hare	2001-12-18

It was to his ultimate career benefit that World War Two came along, giving Lancaster a steady job as well as a launching pad to the career which would make him a fortune and an international celebrity.  He becomes a USO performer and, upon his discharge, lands a part in a New York play.  The play closed early, but Lancaster attracted a Hollywood talent scout's interest and was signed to a contract by Hal Wallis of Paramount.<br />Lancaster became one of the fortunate few actors to become a full-fledged star in his first film.  While his first film officially was the quickly forgotten &quot;Desert Sun&quot; at Paramount with Lizabeth Scott and John Hodiak, he was fortunate that his first ever released film was the much better received &quot;The Killers,&quot; an adaptation of a famous Ernest Hemingway short story.  Director Robert Siodmak knew that he had immediately struck gold with the explosive dynamism of leading man Lancaster and his high voltage leading lady, the sizzling Ava Gardner.  Siodmak would work with Lancaster later in the noir thriller &quot;Crisscross&quot; opposite brunette bombshell Yvonne DeCarlo and in the sea adventure &quot;The Crimson Pirate.&quot;<br />Author Buford has heavily researched Lancaster's busy life, chronicling the fact that the actor's expensive lifestyle fored him into an exhausting cinema workload that would have killed a less powerful man.  Interesting insights are provided into the creative process leading up to Lancaster's Oscar-winning performance in the 1960 adaptation of Sinclair Lewis' powerful novel about a basically sincere while profoundly debauched clergyman, &quot;Elmer Gantry.&quot;  Lancaster and the film's director, Richard Brooks, were equally combustible types.  They spent a lot of time shouting at each other, but eventually hammered out a winning screenplay, for which Brooks received an Oscar.<br />Another fascinating segment of the book deals with Lancaster's efforts in the producing field.  As a partner in Hecht-Hill-Lancaster he shared in the triumph of a Hollywood first, a &quot;Best Picture&quot; Oscar for an independent production, removed from Tinseltown's then solidly dominant studio system.  The film was &quot;Marty&quot; and it made its Oscar-winning star, Ernest Borgnine, into a major international leading man after an earlier seasoning period as a villain.   Another ultimate triumph for the independent team was &quot;Sweet Smell of Success.&quot;  It is now renowned as one of the most biting and brilliantly original film noir efforts ever made, but, like so many classics, such as Hitchcock's &quot;Vertigo,&quot; it took awhile for the film public to warm up to its greatness.<br />Buford also explores Lancaster's life as a generous contributor to liberal causes.  Unlike other more fair weather celebrity types, Lancaster always responded if he believed in the cause without once asking who else would be appearing with him.<br />A man of staggering talent, imagination, and intelligence, the gifted Lancaster is fully explored, as well as his more troubled side, complexities befitting a sensitive artistic genius.  Lancaster maintained a burning presence both on and off the screen. <br />William Hare	2001-12-15

In the process of examining and critiquing the case he also examines its likely impact in the future context of American jurisprudence along with supplying ideas for reforming a system he believes has been sadly sullied by an unwarranted intrusion of partisan politics.<br />Dershowitz explains the standard he uses to determine the fairness of a judge's decision.  He calls it the shoe-on-the-other-foot test.  The rationale is whether, had the facts of the case been identical and only the competing parties differed, a judge would have made the same decision.  After much intelligent legal analysis of each judge who voted for Bush, justices Rehnquist, Thomas, Scalia, O'Connor and Kennedy, Dershowitz concluded that, had Gore been ahead in the Florida vote and been seeking the Supreme Court's assistance in terminating the then ongoing recount, each of the aforementioned would have cast differing votes.  Through analyzing previous decisions of the justices in question, Dershowitz points out the heavy relaince on stare decisis, or legal precedent, of each judge, along with the accompanying reluctance to impose the very supporting arguments relied upon in Bush vs. Gore, the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause and Article Two's concern for consistency on the part of states in conjuction with federal law.  A quintet of judges who established their reputations for heavily deferring to state law, known as the New Federalism, operated in the opposite manner in Bush vs. Gore.<br />Dershowitz's final chapter is exceedingly thoughtful as he urges reform in the selection of federal judges, which he believes will make the process more wieldy,and result in a more evenhanded dispensation of justice.  He urges nonpartisan judicial panels, from which a broad spectrum of talented federal judicial candidates can be drawn, and from which the president can exercise choices.<br />William Hare	2001-12-15

Books	5	14	18	N	N	America's Missed Opportunity	French author-journalist Jean Lacouture first met Vietnamese political leader Ho Chi Minh not long after World War Two, when the Frenchman, who would later write a distinguished two volume biography of French president Charles de Gaulle, had an opportunity to visit what was then French Indo-China.  His resulting perceptive biography of the man his followers referred to affectionately as &quot;Uncle Ho&quot; provided potential food for thought for American policymakers as we tumbled bit by bit into the same kind of tragedy in Vietnam which had originally occurred with the French.  Sadly there is no record of any Americans prominently involved in the decision making regarding our Vietnamese policy ever reading Lacouture's book, which was written after many interviews with the Vietnamese political leader and numerous excursions to the Southeast Asian country.<br />American presidents and their policymakers regarded Vietnam as an important test of America's world leadership.  They believed in the domino theory, the idea that Vietnam would be the first of potentially many Asian dominos to fall unless Communism was repulsed.  Ho Chi Minh was an independent-styled Communist with his own agenda, certainly no tool of Moscow or Peking, in some ways reminiscent of Yugoslavian leader Marshall Tito, who was known for his independence from the Soviet Union.  Ho Chi Minh was a Vietnamese nationalist who insisted he had no designs beyond that nation.  There is no evidence to refute this claim.  We later discovered that there was no domino effect and now we have established diplomatic relations with Communist Vietnam as American business representatives compete for a share of the Vietnamese economic pie.  A shrewd and careful reading of Lacouture's biography of Ho Chi Minh could have illuminated America's frustrated policymakers as the nation was led down a tragic slope to war, division, and fruitless conflict against an elusive foe.<br />William Hare	2001-12-14

Dean Acheson was far more than &quot;Present at the Creation&quot;; he was an architect in creating some of the most vitally needed foreign policy initiatives in the nation's history.<br />In the world of statecraft time and circumstances generate opportunities for greatness.  So it was with Acheson.  Serving as an Under Secretary of State under General George C. Marshall and later as Secretary of State, both in the adiministration of President Harry Truman, Acheson was tapped to deliver the speech that familiarized Americans with what would become the Marshall Plan, an economic package which revitalized Europe during a bleak period following World War Two, helping a great continent get back on its feet and thwarting Soviet expansion plans in the process.<br />Acheson was also a principal architect of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which provided the kind of central military focus and comradeship needed at a time when Russian expansionism threatened to engulf the free world.  Acheson was also intimately involved with the Truman Doctrine, which supplied Greece and Turkey with needed funds in the wake of a direct military threat from the Soviet Union.  As Secretary of State it was Acheson who worked in harmony with President Truman to launch a United Nations coaliation action headed by the United States to defeat Communist aggression when South Korea was attacked by North Korea.<br />Acheson puts the reader in the context of the period when the Cold War bristled at its hottest level of intensity, describing the policies designed to thwart Soviet world objectives as well as delineating the individuals who created and implemented them.<br />William Hare	2001-12-13

He was at his intellectual peak when, as one of America's eminent authorities of his country's political ideologies, he tackled the developing phenomenon of the early sixties' right wing extremism under the guise of conservatism.  He differentiates between the traditional American conservatism espoused by the likes of President Herbert Hoover and Senator Robert Taft alongside the venom of Robert Welch's John Birch Society, in which, as the group's idea man, Welch referred to Dwight D. Eisenhower as a &quot;dedicated and conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.&quot;<br />Hoftstadter delineates how fringe rightist elements took over the Republican Party and rallied behind the banner of Arizona's Senator Barry M. Goldwater, resulting in one of the party's most calamitous losses in the 1964 presidential election against incumbent Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson.<br />The work has a timely ring as an historical analytical measuring rod in comprehending the activities of current right wing movements, such as the Christian Right behind the banners of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson and its link to the militant anti-abortion movement, alongside earlier rightist political philosophies and their vigorous adherents such as Welch and television commentator Dan Smoot.	2001-12-06

Simon's tome on that fascinating campaign is reminiscent of Theodore White's groundbreaking work on the equally dramatic 1960 presidential race between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, &quot;The Making of the President,&quot; which netted White a Pulitzer Prize and launched a series.<br />What makes book such as White's and Simon's so intriguing is that the art of politics is revealed through a series of portraits in books which read like rapidly paced mystery novels as events and the characters who shaped them are analyzed with fascinating precision.  The centerpiece of Simon's work is the nail-biting election night, which culminated in Bush being declared a winner by the major networks, followed by a concession by Gore, then a retraction in the face of additional information based on updated returns.  The dramatic second Bush-Gore conversation was tense, edgy, and caustic.<br />Political professional Simon does a superb job of analyzing major players Bush and Gore, along with revealing how their organizations were comprised and operated.  The operations and their styles demonstrate the contrasting natures of the two presidential candidates.<br />William Hare	2001-12-06

The trial that made him famous as a young lawyer was the Manson Case, where he achieved first degree murder convictions against the cult's leader, Charles Manson, and his co-defendants in the most famous post-World War Two Los Angeles courtroom epic until the more recent O.J. Simpson Case.<br />Bugliosi is not known for mincing words, and he is at his acerbic wittiest in &quot;Betrayal of America,&quot; writing in angry prose about the tragic injustice rendered by the five members of the U.S. Supreme Court majority in Bush vs. Gore, which handed the election ultimately to petitioner Bush.  He accuses the Court majority of circumventing the Constitution and engaging in blind partisanship.  He explores the inherent hypocrisy of the majority of using as its legal linchpin the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, which these same justices disdained using in instances where minority groups and aggrieved private citizens sought relief in more appropriate circumstances.<br />Bugliosi makes a solid case, his prose ringing with righteous indignation as he calls the Court majority to task for a decision he logically believes was based on blind partisan political considerations, resulting in judicial usurpation of the election process.	2001-12-06

Books	5	39	45	N	N	If You Believe in Preserving American Democracy, Read this!	The British philosopher Lord Acton said, &quot;Evil triumphs when good men do nothing.&quot;  Numerous patriotic Americans have given their lives throughout history initially in revolution and later in wars to provide us with a democracy and to help preserve it.<br />Author-journalist John Nichols reveals the theft of democracy by the Bush campaign team and, ultimately, the United States Supreme Court in the 2000 presidential election.  Not one for small talk, Nichols, as the current saying goes, &quot;cuts quickly to the chase.&quot;  He writes about the prevasive influence of George W. Bush's first cousin, John Ellis of Fox News, in making the initial call of Bush as the &quot;winner&quot; of the hotly contested race, along with the masterly spin operation which prompted all other television networks to quickly follow.  From that point Bush was the presumptive president-elect and efforts by the Gore team to secure a definitive recount of Florida voters would be dubbed as the efforts of a &quot;sore loser.&quot;  Much attention is also devoted by Nichols to the successful efforts on the part of Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the candidate's younger brother, and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, a George Bush &quot;co-campaign chair&quot; to disqualify African American voters in Florida, resulting in the estimated disqualification of 31% of the state's elegible African Americans on the state's voting roles.  The effort did not stop there as roadblocks were erected in heavily African American precincts while, among those who attempted to vote, many ballots were discarded.  Also covered in detail by Nichols is the &quot;Butterfly Ballot&quot; controversy in Palm Beach County.  He reveals there was indeed judicial precedent for the revote which the petitioners sought.<br />Another excellent element of Nichols' brilliantly researched effort is his closing reference sources, in which he invites interested citizens to investigate deeper, supplying a treasure troveof sources to facilitate such efforts.	2001-12-05

Lawrence and his efforts to secure freedom for the Arab warriors with whom he fought side by side.  Fromkin takes us from the battlelines into the government offices of the great powers, where the agreements were drawn up and strategies plotted for the post World War One period.<br />Of great current significance is the valuable information about how the Balfour Declaration issued by the British Government declaring support for an eventual Jewish homeland came into being, along with the various interpretations resulting from its publication.  The Paris Peace Conference is also covered in absorbing detail, with Fromkin focusing on the important issues involving the Middle East power structure in the post-war world.

The vibrant blonde star also set a record that has never come close to being equaled in reigning as Hollywood's female box office champ for an incredible ten years.  What made movie fans throughout the world love Betty Grable?<br />Scottish author Tom McGee supplies the answer to that question in his entertaining biography of the popular film great.  A personal friend of Grable's who had the opportunity to interview her at length on many occasions, McGee etches an enduring portrait of a wholesome, caring woman who always put warmth as a human being and loyalties to family and friends above star persona.  Ego was never a problem with the popular superstar in an industry often overcome by it.  When one sees such a warm and totally unaffected woman emerge in the pages of &quot;The Girl With The Million Dollar Legs&quot; it becomes obvious that people the world over loved Betty Grable because of the vibrance, warmth, and sweetness they saw in her.<br />McGee's book is also rich in photographs capturing Grable and the luminous era in which she starred.  There is also a warmly affecting Foreword by fellow Twentieth Century Fox blonde glamour girl, Alice Faye.  Grable and Faye became great friends with no animosity or jealousy ever emerging.<br />This book is a must for Grable fans and all those who love the exciting cinema era of the forties and fifties.

His on the scene portraits of political players provide penetrating insight into them and the process of which they were a part.<br />The most fascinating aspect of this book, which contains character portraits etched from activity recorded by Tapper, is the manner in which Republican operatives, particularly James Baker, engaged in Orwellian doublespeak.  Baker and others were clearly interested in winning an election and did not care how it was accomplished.  Whereas certain Democrats appear concerned about the overall impact of a tragically messy result and how it would unfavorably redound on the nation, Baker, Dole, Sweeney, Hatch, Engler etc. had no such qualms.  Democrats can and should be faulted for not calling their sometimes obvious bluffs more often.<br />Tapper's work involves an American tragedy.  He writes about the election in that context, clearly no happier with the way the game was played or the results than are millions of other unhappy Americans.<br />William Hare	2001-09-03

My own experience in reading the book prompts me to echo Hunter's words of high praise.<br />So many times &quot;how to&quot; books in different areas can be downright dull, like a series of &quot;do's&quot; and &quot;dont's&quot; written in the manner of an old Sears Catalogue.  Such is not the case here.  This book uses numerous examples from scripts of major films to put the prospective writer on track in determining which techniques work as well as those that do not.  The major element separating screenwriting from all other types of fictional writing endeavors is the all-important presence of the camera.  Accordingly, the authors demonstrate the importance of stressing visuality and exercising word economy in crafting a professional level screenplay.<br />One area stressed which greatly assisted me, someone coming from a non-fiction and journalistic background, was the importance of using index cards to set up the story.  The authors explain that the reason why this technique is so important in structuring a story is that, with the profound influence of the camera and the role it plays, it is important for a writer to see the scenes unfolding pictorially before beginning the process of writing words to accompany the images.<br />William Hare	2001-07-18

His globetrotting film adventures gives &quot;So You Wanna Be a Director?&quot; the kind of page-turning narrative thrust of a mystery novel while, at the same time, providing astute analysis of the world cinema past and present.  Annakin learned his craft well, a protege of Sir Carol Reed who launched his career with the hugely successful Hugget series, family entertainment resulting in major box office on both sides of the Atlantic.  Annakin later became a premier filmmaker for Walt Disney and Daryl Zanuck.  His Disney family classic, &quot;The Swiss family Robinson,&quot; filmed entirely on the island of Tobago, remains one of the top grossers in world film history.  His 1957 classic, &quot;Across the Bridge,&quot; was one of the most intriguing film noir spellbinders ever made and helped propel into high gear the career of its star, Rod Steiger.
