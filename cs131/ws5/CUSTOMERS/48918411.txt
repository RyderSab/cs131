This book is an excellent example of wisdom of the advice \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\", and that phrase in itself is a precis of a plot which defies description.<br />The book contains many interesting details about tibetan life. For instance, it answered my daughter's query about how the tibetan diet provides enough vitamin C.	2002-12-18

I was looking for more detail on hexagonal systems.<BR> Instead there is less detail and less formal mathematics. I found it to be rather similar to other publications by Ian Stewart, such as the book Fearful Symetry which contains many of the same ideas.<br />Despite my personal desires I am glad to see that Ian has finally been granted lots and lots of expensive four colour illustrations with which to explain how interesting mathmatics really is.<br />I immediately found a use for it in the workshops I run for children. It is the best illustrated book Mr Stewart has yet produced.	2002-07-19

It is really nice when you can trace the roots of puzzles roots back and name the particular area of mathematics that the puzzle related to.<br />Very often students are given puzzles to do but no view of the area of higher mathematics to which they are connected. I remember how excited I was when I realized that the famous &quot;Handshake puzzle&quot; was so nicely related to number theory. In this case Sarah's father, being a mathematics teacher and researcher himself, was able to give her the puzzles AND the view of the area of mathematics to which the concepts could later be applied. <br />This was a particularly interesting account of how a young person conducted a research project which involved learning a subject in depth, following her own interests and using her creativity rather than just preparing for an exam. So often it seems to be assumed that creativity must wait until the student knows &quot;enough&quot;. This book shows how, with the right mentoring, students can tap into their creativity early and how this is a fantastic way to create interest and enthusiasm for a subject which regrettably remains for most people, dull boring and even something to fear.	2002-07-10

It is illustrated, though sparsely, with her own charming sketches. <br />The book explains the complex tribal system of social relationship where strict rules on intermarriage inevitably spark off tribal blood feuds. It is another view of this worlds  love affair with the gun. You will be intrigued by the tradition of the &quot;Albanian virgin&quot;.<br />I came to understand better, through reading this book,the civilizing power of government. The author also deals with the development of the concept of individuation and personal responsibility. This is often accompanied by the original folk stories that Ms Durham recorded. <br />Edith Durham became for a time unofficial &quot;Queen&quot; in recognition of her contributions to social welfare. The daughter of an English surgeon, she never married, but fell in love on a holiday trip and gave her life to a people. I would like to read more by, or about this woman.	2001-05-27

This is an interesting book. The cover is dreadful, one expects to find typical Sunday school material within. However by chance I opened it at the section dealing with discoveries of ancient artifacts near the great lakes. This is something I had never heard about and so I was taken to read on.   The author of the book is obviously a confirmed creationist,and it seems she feels that the existence of the ark is evidence for the creationist viewpoint. I am out on this since I believe that the existence of the ark would prove only the existence of the ark, not that the theory of evolution is totally wrong.<br />The book is not hysterical in tone nor does it make wild, irrational claims. The author makes no attempts to promote her religion, whatever variety it is. It simply puts forward evidence of repeated sightings of an object on the slopes of Ararat, and points out that the descriptions made in all the reports are very similar. Most of the material quoted was unknown to me. I could not make a judgement of the possible validity of the evidence without undertaking more reseach.   I am glad I read the book and it gave me a lot of interesting leads for furthur investigation. That for me, is a good read.	2000-12-20

The title of this book is really &quot;How is your business digital?&quot; However, because it is commmonly thought that the more digital strategies that are implemented the better your business will get, the authors have cleverly diguised the title by moving the words around. This is a cunning  plot to sell more books. <br />The Authors are quick to point this out. It is not, they profess, the amount of digitalization of a business that matters, it is whether the manner of digitalization is appropriate for that business.<br /> &quot;How is your business digital?&quot; looks at how digital tools can be used as part of a sound business plan, to be progressively implemented over approximately four years. The first step is to know &quot;How is your business&quot;, which involves examining it in the cold light of reality. The digital strategies implemented should help to keep you better informed of how your business is from day to day, or hour to hour, or even minute to minute. The book includes instructions for an internet site tour which gives practical examples of good websites and functional choiceboards.<br />  The authors do a good job of pointing out that digital strategies make it possible to know your customers in ways not possible before, and offers a stern warning that if you do not go out of your way to meet your customers, then they will take their needs elsewhere.	2000-12-16

A series of amazing short anecdotes served by the bumbling but blessed yogi. You will really enjoy the account of the valley of flowers where all sense of time vanishes, drowned in the hypnotic scent of rhododenrons. This book does not skirt self consciously around the unbelievable. It lays it all on the table.<br />This is one of the few books I have read which is willing to discuss the concept of ending life consciously by yogic means. It gives descriptions of the different ways this can be done. Of course it does not give instuctions on how to do it, which would be dangerous, but it does give the idea that control over the process of death is possible, if you are willing to put in the effort and study required.    You can read the sections out of order and it still makes sense. This sort of format is good if you are like me and find it hard to put a book down once you start it.	2000-11-09

He suggests  that in the not too distant past humanity had access to a powerful plant or  plants which they were able to use to heal or to rejeuvenate. One reviewer,  Willard Johnson, refers to this as a daring thesis, and well it may seem to  some.<br />      Prior to reading this book I had encountered enough  references of like nature to enable me to have formed similar conclusions.  This is one of the reasons I purchased the book. unfortunately some of the  references I came across, and which particularly interested me, are not  quoted in the book. Anyone who is curious as a result of reading this book  can be assured that there is certainly more information to be found.               Mr Spess seems to be of the opinion that the psychoactive qualities  of the plant are instrumental in increasing the power of the mind,  therefore enabling spontaneous healing and rejeuvenation to occur. Mr Spess  does, I feel, get overly euphoric about his conclusions in this regard and  rambles on, sometimes for pages at a time, during which he has the  unfortunate tendency to proffer his personal conclusions as fact. That he  should be excited by this topic is understandable, but the lack of  objectivity is sometimes annoying. I feel he would do better to provide  more examples of the original materials from which he is quoting.<br />       From the reading I have done I have formed the conclusion that the soma  rejeuvenation procedure was a somewhat more radical experience than the  three day Soma Holiday described by Mr Spess. The accounts that I found  describe and period of preparatory fasting and special diet, Collection of  the plant at a particular time of year, the construction of a special  sterile,light proof isolation chamber, dramatic physical consequences, andthe need for months of intensive care for the process to be complete. Under  these conditions death would not seem an unlikely outcome.<br />           In  seems to me that advanced powers of mind control would be required to  overcome the fear of the procedure. If the drug produced frightening  hallucinations then it may have been important to have become accustomed to  this before undertaking the full procedure.<br />            I've had a good  rave but believe me there is more to say. Please read the book, and the  sequel. I will definitely be giving this book to my daughter to read as an  accompaniment to her studies of &quot;Brave New World&quot;.	2000-09-05

The great man was still very  much alive when I heard him speak several years ago at the University of  New South Wales conference organized by Hawker Brownlow. If you ever get a  chance to hear this man speak don't pass it up. The chance may not come  again.          What you get out of hearing him will depend on what you  know of his work and reading this book beforehand would be a good strategy.  Feurerstein is not a rev 'em up motivational speaker with a few clever  tricks up his sleeve (of which there are a few on the conference circuit).  He makes a sincere attempt to present his work in a serious way and the  more you know of his work the more you will appreciate how difficult it is  to do a short presentation on it. It is well worth spending a couple of  thousand dollars to go to the International Conference of the Institute for  the Enhancement of Learning Potential. This runs every year at Shoresh near  Jerusalem. I went over and it was one of the best things I have ever done.         Back to the book itself. The techniques described in it are not just  applicable to &quot;poor&quot; students. They are applicable to all  students up to the highest level of intellectual functioning. Doing a  course in these techniques does not just give the instructor the tools to  help struggling students,it changes the instructor themselves. The  materials are a self developement course in themselves. There is no  escape!  This book does dwell upon the use of the techniques in low  functioning students but other works on this topic give a broader  perspective.        One of the reasons Feurerstein has chosen to work with  Down Syndrome children in particular, is because of frustration with  attitudes which suggest you can't teach intelligence. When children  improved markedly under his guidance then people would say &quot;Well they  could not have beenso bad to begin with the original assessment must have  been wrong&quot;. With Down Syndrome children no-one can deny that they  have trisomia.        I have seen some of these children and the way they  function and the attitudes of the staff of the Institute. It is wonderful!  I have seen the materials in this book being used at the school for gifted  childrn in Tel Aviv, and have used them myself on a range of students of  all abilities.      It is time consuming, and it is difficult to persuade  some parents that doing activities which are not reading and not  calculation are really helpful and worth the time spent. There are  worksheets dealing with teaching spatial orientation and Visual transport  for instance which are pre-reading skills.      The use of the word  &quot;retarded&quot; in this book bothers some people extremely, but don't  let it get to you. Feurerstein has a particular definition of this word in  mind when he uses it and its not supposed to sound insulting. If you are  not an academic just read in &quot;behind&quot; and go on to find the  treasures that this material contains.       Well that is my push to get  this book back in print and boost the sales ratings. It is a shame to think  that this great man may not get the recognition that he deserves in this  lifetime. His is a labour of love. Somebody please nominate him for a Nobel  Prize.	2000-08-22

Feurerstein clearly explains how a learning  disability is self referencing. The disability usually induces an  environment which offers less opportunities to learn and so the individual  learns less,and as a result his environment becomes even less generous.  Feurerstein offers strategies for parents and educators to counteract this  tendency of the disability to imbed itself. It gives clear names for the   cognitive functions which are the tools of thinking, and shows how parents  and educators can train themselves to become aware of these behaviours or  the lack of them.         The diagnostic procedures look not for an average  of abilities but for areas of strength and weakness and most importantly  for potential to learn in any area. Building upon strength rather than  supporting weakness is the basic idea. Feurerstein exposes the dangers of  overeliance on concrete aids for students who have difficulty reasoning  abstractly. Instead he suggests that they should be taught to reason  abstractly, and then shows us how.         Some of the language in this  book is offputting for the non-academic person and some of the things  described may be confronting.	2000-08-22

My advice is to read this book back  to front because if you don't you may give up on it before you are able to  synthesize all the valuable information in it into the wonderful revelation  that the book provides on pre-history. Combined with other sources such as  the bible thoughtfully read, and info on Sumerian and Indian Mythology its  a book which can change the way you see the world and your place in it.	2000-08-17

Until I worked out what was going on. The writer  is using, in these sections,the literary equivalent of the mathematical  zero. That is to say, the stuff you put in the spaces which would otherwise  have to remain blank. So be sure to read all or nothing.	2000-08-17

One of the most incredible things about it is it was not originally a book, but a series of close to 100 large wall  paintings (full colour! )designed to decorate the walls of the medical  school in Lhasa. The painting were copied several times and the copies  became disseminated among neighbouring countries and so have survived the  burning and looting that has taken place in Tibet. The book is a record of  an art gallery of medical illustrations which detail every aspect of the  traditional medicine of that time. They do this with a beauty which must be  seen to be believed and with a sensitivity which captures the soul of  medicine. The work was done as a votive offering by monks working in the  sixteenth century. What a beautiful gift they left us!	2000-08-17
