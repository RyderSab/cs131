This book is about Christie having problems with her science teacher, Miss Finney, at her new school in London.  Christie's always made fabulous grades, especially in science, and suddenly she's gettting D's and C's.  The problem is, Christie KNOWS she's doing all her assignments right, Miss Finney is purposely NOT being fair.  Christie doesn't know what to do, until she hears about the school's annual science fair and decides that by winning it, she can prove herself to Miss Finney.<br />This book was sort of boring to me, but I still liked it.  Sideplots are: Christie trying to figure out what to do about Chase and Connie- she likes them both, but is it realistic to not date Connie here in England because she likes Chase still, even though she might never see Chase again? AND Jana is writing to Christie asking for advice on whether she should break up with boyfriend, Randy, who she's been dating for a year or so.	2001-04-02

Will the Fab Five remain close even when thousands of miles apart?<br />I liked this book a lot- I think it was my favorite book about Christie in the series.

Jana Morgan is honored and excited when she's one of the two kids picked out of her entire 7th grade class to be a buddy to a homeless kid coming to Wacko.  But her hopes of making a new friend are dashed when she gets a load of Liz Flagg, the homeless girl she has to be a buddy to.  Grouchy Liz seems to have built a wall around herself that even friendly, sweet Jana can't get through.  But Jana Morgan is not one to give up so easily- when Liz says Jana couldn't take living in a homeless shelter, Jana takes her up on it and finally starts to understand why Liz is such a tough nut to crack.  I don't won't spoil anything, I just want to say that I really, really loved this book and I think it's one of the best in the whole series!! I don't know how people can't like Jana- she's such a sweet, terrific person and she really tries to understand people. (Okay, maybe not Laura McCall and Taffy Sinclair! ;-)  Jana and her boyfriend, Randy, have some sweet moments in this book, too, that I thought were cute! If you possibly can, read this one!!

If only Katie had never mentioned how she wished there was no TV... she had been mad when she said that, mad that her boyfriend would rather watch a ball game on TV then be with HER.  She hadn't expected her mom to jump up and write a newspaper article about what a menace TV was and get Wacko Jr High involved in a TV Turnoff! Now Katie can't get a moment's peace at school, and she and Tony had a huge fight... will things ever get back to normal? This book was an excellent addition to The Fabulous Five series, and I highly suggest it.  I think it's my favorite &quot;Katie&quot; book in the whole series! A lot happens in it, and there is a lot of interaction between all the kids at school, not just with the Fab Five.	2001-02-05

Mrs. Haynes has a terrific sense of humor and there were numerous places in this book where I just burst out laughing! She really captures a 5th grade girl well.  Yup, not right to gang up on someone just because you don't like them, but Jana did know what she did was wrong and EVEN IN THE BOOK she thought about what a horrible person she was and resolved to change for the better.  (she and Taffy still get into tiffs in the future though) I don't think Jana comes off mean at all in this book- I feel sorry for her.  She's just a little kid without a dad (a very normal problem today)- the parts about her dad and how she feels about him are so-- touching. :*)  I think it's stupid Jana and her friends worried about how undeveloped they were compared to Taffy, though- come on! They were only 10 years old.  This book makes you hate Taffy's mom- she's  a witch! Poor Taffy! No wonder she's the way she is.  Kind of weird how NONE of the boys (save Clarence) in her class are mentioned in this book, when they play such a big part in the rest of the Taffy series.  Anyway, this book had a lot of embarrassing moments in it for Jana, but it's was VERY well written, VERY realistic, VERY funny, and had a VERY good message.  You're crazy if you don't want to read it!!!	2000-10-14

I just read this book not to long ago, (after practically reading the rest of the series), and don't know how I managed! If you love the Fab Five series, you should definitely read this first.  It really introduces the Fab Five, Wacko, teachers, and hangouts.  The story was really good too- a lot of things happening at once.  (Jana worried her new friend, Funny is really spying on her; worried she'll lose her Fab Five friends for being friends with Funny, a member of the rival clique; worried that Randy won't be her boyfriend; worried about Beth and what's going on to make her so distant and cold) You definitely should try to read it if you haven't! Don't listen to the other reviews- this series isn't as stereotypical as some people say it is.  They do have a lot on popularity and looks and stuff, but the messages are still good.  And yeah, some of the boys are jerks, but most of them aren't! (like Scott, Shane, Randy, Jon, Tony...) And they AREN'T immediately paired up with guys.  Three are because they have the same b/fs they had in gradeschool.	2000-10-02

Then Mel manages to get all the Fab Five to come and they set out Christmas Day to spend a whole week of fun in the sun! All the girls have boyfriends back home and they certainly don't plan on meeting guys, but things change when they get a load of Marco Montavo, the charming, handsome singer at the villa they are staying out.

His flirting charms work and soon all the girls have a crush on him (even Katie!) But they figure things out in the end and get revenge! I really did like this book, it's just that they spent all their time running around secretly meeting Marco.  I'm glad they wised up and realized what great guys they have back home.  =)	2000-09-23

But Jana Morgan soon finds out the downside of the whole thing when a lot of the kids in her class start acting like big deals and planning on showing their &quot;maturity&quot; by taking liquor in thermoses on their class trip to Ellis Island.  When Jana, the rest of the Fab Five and some of their other friends decide not to drink, they are ridiculed as 'babies'.  (how true!) Meanwhile, Jana is also becoming a bit worried when she sees her worst enemy (Laura McCall) hanging around her boyfriend, Randy Kirwan,  a lot. Is something really going on between them, or is she being paranoid again? Plus, Jana is also upset that she hasn't heard from her father lately- is her new stepmom hiding Jana's letters from her dad? And what's up with Beth?

Only all her plans backfire and instead of great, the Fab Five is starting to become laughingstocks, especially Beth.

I mean, she has to pull even the Fab Five's arms to get them interested in starting like, say an all girls club.  Then Katie gets some unexpected help from a  person of the past- can Katie really make a difference or is she doing all this in vain? This is the best book from Katie's POV.  I think it's dumb that she gets so uptight about the guys getting together without the girls, but I also think it's dumb how the lives of the other girls revolve around their crushes and b/fs.	2000-09-23

Okay, Jana decides that she and Randy should break up for a while and date other people to see if they are REALLY right for each other, since neither of them have ever dated other people.  Randy doesn't want to, but he agrees, and the experiment begins.  After a bad date with Parker Donovan, Jana begins to wish she'd never broke up with Randy, especially when she hears Sara Sawyer has a mad crush on him and is going to ask him out.  Can things get worse? Definitely.  Beth is also having problems with Keith and then he asks Jana to tell Beth he wants to break up with her! That's bad enough, but then he tells Jana his reason- he has a crush on Jana and wants to date her!  How can Jana tell her best friend something like that? Things get even farther out of hand and Jana knows she's going to have to do something FAST, before she loses her reputation and ALL her friends.  You HAVE to read this book! It's one of the best in series! And will Jana and Randy get back together, I'm not going to tell! =)	2000-09-23

But once she gets to class, her teacher announces her stolen wallet and Jana realizes that SHE'S holding the stolen wallet!  Now she doesn't know whether to turn it in (will she look guilty?) or put it back where she found it and hope the custodian will return it.  She and her friends vote for the latter and she's just putting it back after school when who walks in, but Taffy Sinclair! But Taffy wants payment in return for her silence (she thinks Jana really did steal the wallet) and decides to make Jana pretend to be her friend and do her homework.  Jana is furious at being blackmailed, but what can she do? She and her friends figure that TAFFY is really the guilty culprit and decide to frame her.

Anna is all  into her Drama Club and the skit she's doing with her new friends, Larissa  and Toby.  But in the midst of getting a new life, she forgets about her  old one and misses a lot of Zone meetings and doesn't hang with Sal and Liz  too much. I like Larissa and the other Drama kids a lot, so I think I'll  like the book Wild Child.  Don't be afraid of not liking the new  characters- they're cool. I thought it was dumb how Anna dyed her hair red  (I don't even want to try to imagine that) but I think Sal needed to get a  life.  He's so selfish- first he wants Liz, and pushes Anna away, now he  wants Anna back. (as a friend) I wish Sal would move or something.  He's  one of my least favorites.  Meanwhile, Kristin is beginning to work on a  school carnival (that continues through the next two books) and has some  run-ins with her jealous mother.	2000-09-02

It's mostly about how her mom comes back for a visit and isn't exactly like what Lacey thought she'd  be.  Lacey gets all excited when her mom invites Lacey to come live with  her, then is broken hearted when her mom changes her mind at the last  minute.  Personally, I'm glad.  As much as I don't really care for Lacey,  I'm glad she's seeing what a horrible person her mom is and that she's  headed down the same road. Meanwhile, Kristin and Bethel have a bunch of  fights while trying to get the carnival set up.  Both are leaders and it's  still hard for Bethel to follow Kristin's commands... even though Kristin  doesn't TRY to be bossy... Also, Liz is starting to hang with Blue and the  volleyball groupie now, but when she tries to get the 'mellow' group  organized, disaster strikes! I don't blame Liz for trying to get things  together- if I were her, though, I'd seriously quit the team all together.  I mean, she said she wanted to join the team to get to know new people, but  all we've really heard about is Leaf and Blue.  And I think Blue is pretty  annoying- he was one character who shouldn't have been added, I think.  Anyway, this was an okay book, but it's not necessary to read or anything.

(btw, I know in  #18 they are b/f and g/f) Damon and Jessica also have some little  misunderstandings- Damon thinks something is wrong with Jessica because  she's so out of it all the time (she's just very tired- read the book to  find out why) and Jessica thinks that Damon doesn't like her anymore  because he hasn't asked her to the blowout.

I enjoyed this book,  just like all the Taffy ones, and I love to see how Jana matures in each  one. Sure she makes mistakes, but don't we all? Mona is a good example of a  good friend, and Taffy is lucky to have her.  Too bad Taffy is such a brat  she doesn't realize it.  So if you want to read an EXCITING book with an  actual plot, toss the boring BSC books down and pick up one by Betsy  Haynes.  The FABULOUS FIVE ROCKS!	2000-05-28

Jana is really upset when most of her class gets all caught up in being the upperclassman the next year and start doing things (like planning to take booze on a field trip) that Jana and her friends don't think are right.  I thought the storyline was really interesting and that it was a  lot more realistic then some of the other books in the Fab Five series.  Also, it was so exciting that she got a letter from her dad! All through  the series, I've been hoping things would get resolved between her and her  dad, and this is a start.  I really really wish Betsy Haynes would write  another series about the girls in 8th grade or highschool- there is so much  more that can happen!  Why are these good books out of print?  Also, I  thought it was good that Laura got some come-uppance in this book. She  always does nasty things and gets away with it, but here she learned a  lesson.  Though you do feel a little bad for her. I hope you can find this  book and read it some day.  GO BACK IN PRINT!	2000-04-02

Yeah, I can see the mean part in ganging up on someone you're jealous of, but it's not abnormal.  There are always enemies in schools, and I don't like how people try to compare the Fab Five with BSC.  The BSC girls are NOT perfect on they are immature in their own ways too. Anyway, the book is  basically about TEN YEAR OLD Jana starting a club against totally snotty  and beautiful Taffy Sinclair.  Jana and her friends write down all the  snotty things Taffy do, and then it gets into the wrong hands and Jana gets  in trouble.  No, Taffy and Jana do not solve their differences and still  wage war in the 6th grade.  But they do make up in the 7th grade!  (read  Yearbook Memories) I don't think jana is a mean person, though.  Maybe  you'll think Taffy is misunderstood after reading this book and feel all  sorry for her- well, she's no angel.	2000-04-02

I thought it was really cool how they had first-person accounts from each of the fab fivers.  I loved how Jana and Taffy made up- everyone is always  dissing Jana because she acts immature sometimes, but at least she realizes  it and tries to mend her faults.  Beth's memory was really good, too, on  how she learned it's okay to be your own person.  The other memories were  fun to read as well, and the yearbook section was SO COOL!  I wish these  books were still in print so you could read it too.	2000-03-23

At a party celebrating the news that the coming school year the soon-to-be-8th graders will be the upperclassman, some of the boys talk the  girl throwing the party into serving everyone a champagne toast to  celebrate.  Jana doesn't think it's a good idea, but everyone else is for  it- after all, what can one little sip do? But things get out of hand at  the next weeks class trip when some of the 7th graders smuggle in booze in  their thermoses.  Jana and her friends keep out of it and try to stop the  others, but it doesn't work.  Dont' worry, no one gets super drunk or  anything like that, but it is a more realistic story-line, even though I'm  not sure 7th graders have trouble with drinking.  I thought it was very  realistic on how Jana felt on the subject.  This was really good.	2000-03-23
