I personally would summarize it as follows.  The early historical narratives that we read were written without a concern for the most prominent questions modern intellectuals desire to be answered (e.g., political causation, economic realities, psychological motivations, etc.); therefore, the best way to approach these text before pursuing our questions is to ask what the aims and questions of the authors of these works were trying to accomplish and answer.  Rather than these modern questions, the narratives of the Abbasid caliphate, he argues, were more interested in events from a moralizing and religious perspective.  Thus, El-Hibri makes the convincing case that these are not factual recollections of political realities or events but are rather embellished narratives either serving ideology or in the service of demonstrating some religious moral. <br />Taking invdividual accounts relating to caliphal reigns from Harun al-Rashid to al-Mutawakkil, he makes a convincing case for the 'literary character' of narratives while providing useful methodological tools for identifying these moralizing currents.	2004-09-06

Noth's work maintains its value because it is able to take one past the basic textual appreciation that the histories of Islam tend to come in the form of khabars consisting of matns and isnaads to get under the hood of how histories and narratives were effectively created in the stylized forms that we now have.  None of this is as dull as it may seems insofar as it goes a long way to provide the historian with tools for separating the wheat from the chaff in these ancient narrative.  Of course, Noth does not solve all of the problems presented to us by the sources, but he does give us some useful tools that rigorous and much less mystifying that the notorious `sixth-sense'  that Islamicists tend to evoke when commenting on the historicity of any series of details on a historical event.  <br />	2004-08-30

Using the court-records of Bursa as a principal, albeit limited when discussing an empire-wide issue, source, Gerber mainly takes an apologetic tone throughout the work in defense of the Ottoman legal system against its Weberian critics.    <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />Well the work itself is fine and generally well argued, the style of the book itself I found to be disagreeable.  Although the discussions and  conversations of Weberian sociology and anthropological studies are useful, these occur in a dearth of descriptive material.  I was disappointed to find  that Gerber never takes sufficient amount of time to describe in detail the sources  employed, what they tell us about the Ottoman empire beyond the specific region of Bursa, and the picture of the courts they provide.   No direct, uninterrupted picture of how an Ottoman court actually worked was ever provided.  Piecing this picture together from disjointed anecdotes proved frustrating and onerous.  The overall structure of the work, which I repeated was well-argued, is one where Gerber let his axe-grinding get in the way of composing a truly solid piece of history.  <br />	2004-08-30

Not too rarely is he compared with the Christian intellectual giant, St. Augustine.  This is not an inaccurate portrait.  As such, many curious readers may desire to read something by al-Ghazali in order to sample his thought.  This volume might be tempting to some since it is one of his most famous works.  I regret to say that I must  recommend against it, for although the work itself is a classic, a masterpiece of Islamic scholarship, it is  also deeply abstruse.  Moreover, there is little that is asserted in the positive sense of al-Ghazali's personal beliefs.  Being that the main aim of the work is to show the feebleness and vanity of philosophy to surpass revelation, most of the work can be characterized as principally deconstructive. In this regard, it is as vicious as it is systematic, rigorous and disarming even if the consequences al-Ghazali pointed to, such as atomism and the denial of all forms of causality, appear highly tendentious to all modern currents of thought.   All but the most intrepid readers, I fear, may despair at its contents.  I wholeheartedly recommend the potential to start elsewhere, such as Deliverance from Error, an autobiographical work. <br />  <br />With this caveat in mind, a few words about this edition for the non-initiate.  The translation and the editing of the Arabic text are absolutely top-notch, and the parallel placement of the English-Arabic columns are easily followed by those familiar with both languages.  Accompanying the text throughout are expository and explanatory notes that are immanently useful for both understanding cross-referencing the text with the works of the likes of Ibn Sina and al-Farabi.  The aim of this series to create a parallel of the `Loeb Classics' for Islamic Studies appears to be directly on course. <br />	2004-08-24

Aleppo	Marcus' work is an astonishing achievement in historical description and archival  research.  While being careful not to transgress of limitations of his sources, he nonetheless is able to construct a fascinating, intriguing picture of life in Aleppo, Syria in the 18th century.  His organization scheme focuses predominately on beginning with a wide lens view of Aleppo as situated in the Ottoman Empire and the vicissitudes of political life, economic fortune and misfortune, and at times social chaos and upheaval down to the more narrow view of the every day life of individual and  his relation to his body/health, religion, family and neighbors.  The book is extremely readable while maintaining scholarly rigor at the same time.  I would have no hesitations recommended it to anyone generally interested in the Middle East or traveling through the region with an interest in its history. <br /> <br />My impression of the overarching thesis of the book was that Aleppo as a society was anything but stagnant and frozen in time but was a dynamic society of adaptation and profound efforts to maintain tradition and religious belief.  This being said, Marcus, unlike a scholar such as Peter Gran, see no tendencies or intimations of a development of an Aleppine modernity prior to contact with an ever-expanding Europe.  In other words, there was no autochthonous tendency towards what is now considered to be the ostensibly universal process of `modernization'. <br />	2004-08-24

The thesis of the work is relatively simple: nationalist identity has predominated the discourse of the Arab intelligentsia particularly in writing of history.  What, however, makes this work so useful is the lucid fashion in which it traces modern Arabic historical writing from 19th century pioneers such as al-Jabarti and al-Tahtawi to more modern, established scholars such as Shafiq Ghurbal, Kamal Salibi, and Abdallah Laroui.  Intersped with this mapping out of the intellectual are profound critiques of each individual thinker and the development of Arab nationalism as a whole.  Rarely are Arabic historians given such a systematic analysis, and even less often are they posited in such an enlightening, contextualizing historical narrative making this a work that  should be  read by every historian of the modern Middle East.	2004-08-24

This is a genuinely unique work that should be read by every serious student of the Mid East.<br />The essential thesis of this rests on the assertion that in Coptic experience, traditional and church hierarchy proved to be dynamic resources for modernizing the community.  Such an assertion is highly counter-intuitive, but Hasan demonstrates with seemingly effortless skill just how well this paradigm fits the Coptic experience.  For her, Coptic modernity appears as both a competitor with the modernization project of the Egyptian state and an Egyptian manifestation of the turn-of-the-century politicization of ethnic identities.<br />This book almost entirely focuses on the founding generation of the Sunday School Movement, which took the reigns of public church leadership vis-&agrave;-vis the state from the rich, westernized elites whose influence the Free Officer coup destroyed, and how the subsequent generation had to and continues to learn how to negotiate its legacies, rivalries and politics.  Here, the perspicacity concerning Church and lay politics becomes demonstrably profound-exhibiting a level of familiarity only made possible by years of experience.  Her insights in this regard are perhaps the most valuable.<br />Moreover, controversial topics are addressed with unflinching transparency.  Thus, neither does she neglect to address pressing issues of religious discrimination, disenfranchisement and marginalization facing the Copts in an increasingly Islamicized Egypt, nor intra-ecclesiastical problems such as the sometimes intractable authoritarianism of the church clerisy, nor the often immiserated position of women, etc.	2004-06-23

Working within a relatively small timeframe (1977-1979), Kurzman methodically examines five explanatory paradigms which have hitherto been mobilized to explain the success of the Iranian Islamic Revolution.  Emplotting each paradigm on a brisk narrative of the revolution itself, he begins with the political explanations (attributing the revolution to increased liberalization), organizational explanations (focusing on mosque and university networks), cultural explanations (pointing to the utilization of 40 day martyrdom mourning cycle as a means of sustaining protest), economic explanations (citing the gridlock caused by the  nation-wide strikes in key industries), and military explanations (pointing to the feeble attempts of the Shah's forces  to restore state control).  Each of these he finds inadequate and only some completely false.  At best, an explanation remains partial but not compelling for the whole.  Moreover, they demonstrate a consistent occurrence of the `inversion of cause and effect', e.g., student mobilization created the utility of the mosque networks, mobilization led to the state's economic crisis, not vice versa.<br />Kurzman attempts to cut the Gordian knot by offering his own  `anti-explanation'-namely, the revolution succeeded when it become viable in the minds of its core constituents.  This `anti-explanation', he asserts, is non-predictive because it depends on the anomalous nature of the agency of social actors.  What is left for the sociologist is to strive for an understanding of a peculiar, unique event.<br />This deconstructive enterprise is essentially a treatise against retroactive prediction that argues rather for sociological reconstructions of historical events rather an attempt to derive patterns for the sake of being able to predict when future, nascent revolutions are about to occur.  Kurzman unconsciously it seems has  merely constructed an argument for the values of social-history over sociology as such.  Where his novel, so-called `anti-explanation' differs from what we call `history' eludes me.<br />Overall, the writing in the book is fluid, lucid and accompanied by a nice balance of anecdote and analysis.  His usage of jargon is sparse and rare-limited mostly to a few quotes from famous sociologists such as Bourdieu and Parsons.  He demonstrates a familiarity with Persian culture and language that manifests itself in many subtle ways through the work.  General readers, historians and sociologists will find this book an immensely rewarding study.	2004-06-09

The slave-revolt resulted in a state that eventually minted its own money and enslaved their former Arab master, but the extended revolt was also one that was the result of large number of extremely bloody massacres--mostly able to do so because the caliphate was too busy with the Saffarids to the East at the time.  It's not a nice moment either in the history of central caliphate or in world history generally.<br />The preface to the English translation states that comments deemed too scholarly were deleted, glosses for the non-specialist added, transliteration simplified, and references ammended.  However, the end result is an indecipherable, insipid  transliteration system which the translator was often too lazy to at least anglicize (French differs greatly often from English transliteration of Arabic), useless bibliography and notes, and a stilted wooden  translation.<br />Honestly though, this is a mere frustrating technicality.  The sole virtue of the book must be that it is the only one dedicated exclusively to the revolt of the Zanj in  Southern Iraq.  However, its analysis-free, anallistic, stream of consciousness narrative makes an extremely interesting topic vapid and bland.  Insofar as it adds little to nothing to the Arabic sources, such as al-Tabari and al-Mas'udi, there is little reason to read this account rather than going strait to the sources.  Both Tabari's Annales (in print) and Mas'udi's Prairies of Gold (not in print) are in English.  I would  only recommend this book if someone was possessed of an ambition to understand  the revolt of the Zanj, not for example a general reader interested in the history of slavery generally or only with reservation for a person interested in the history of  Islam and the slave-trade/revolts.	2004-06-01

Locating the construction of the slave-soldier Turkish regiments under the reign of al-Ma'mun, he adeptly attributes the origin of this practice to the need of the 'Abbasid state to reconstruct its military power following the devastating civil war of al-Ma'mun vs. his brother, al-Amin.  Thereafter, his account traces the founding of Sammara--a nearly unparalleled, massive medieval city bordering on a million inhabitants at its peak--which served as both the the new seat of the caliph and the base of the Turkish armies.  Gordon gives a cogent, lucid picture of the political and social dynamics that the formation of the Turkish slave-soldier regiments.  While tracing the rise and influence of the new Turkish elite, he convincingly points to the internal contradictions that led the undoing of Turkish influence over the caliphate and the eventual erosion and waning of central Abbasid power (which was always fragile).   Half of the pages dedicated to the work consists of the bibliography and footnotes.  Gordon demonstrates a fluency in the source material that does not deprive him of an analytical edge that many of the historians of his field too often lack.	2004-06-01

In so doing, the work conjectures as to what effect this incipent individuallist, piety-minded conception of the warrior had on the structure of society, especially in accounting for the weakening of the emerging Islamic aristocracy of the period.  Bonner achieves this by examining legal literature on legitimate warrior ethics (esp. by focusing on the unpopular notion of 'substitution' for the universally required participation in jihad), the historical literature's chronicle of the institutionalization of the frontier raids, and finally with a fascinating examination of scholar/ascetic warrior-saints of the frontier.  The final section is perhaps the most enlightening, although the entire book is an excellent resource on early classical Islamic conceptions of jihad.	2004-04-27

Against traditional arguments attributing the fall to inner conflicts such as provncial and factional unrest, Blankinship attributes the fall to the contradictions inherent in jihad, itself the impetus for the expansion of the political realm of Islam.  Jihad proved, eventually, the be not only unsustainable but also deeply self-destructive in the end as it exhausted all of the states resources and tested the loyalty of the state's armies as it continually faced ever more wild and formidable enemies with diminishing returns and profits from bounty.  Blankinship, in the end, gives a convincing argument that Hisham b. abd al-Malik's reign was not the height but was rather they beginning of the fatal decline of the Umayyad dynasty.	2004-04-19

Though highly controversial, it is nonetheless a classic in the field.<br />The thesis set forth by Crone and Hinds can be succinctly stated thus: the Imamî/Shicî view of the caliphate is an archaism rather than an innovation as suggested by previous scholarship, which characterized the early Umayyad Caliphs as largely politically minded and irreligious. <br />Crone and Hinds spread out an examination of the early usages of the title khalîfat Allâh, i.e., `deputy of God', as the foundation of their case. After a sweeping overview of the known Umayyad attestations and attributions of the title and elsewhere, they forcefully argue for the official status of the title khalîfat Allâh for the Umayyad head of state. This contradicts the claim of majority tendency of the `ulamâ' to claim that caliphal title was merely khalîfat rusûl Allâh, or, `successor/deputy of God's messenger'. The following are the three points which are seen to provide sufficient reason to reject of account of the `ulamâ': 1) those who reject the title khalîfat Allâh are Abu Bakr, `Umar, `Umar II, and other `ulamâ'-i.e., the religious scholars and their favorite \\"mouthpieces\\"; 2) the title khalîfat rusûl Allâh appears in an explicitly polemical context vis à vis the title khalîfat Allâh; 3) if the original meaning of `Caliph' was merely `successor to God's prophet', then why did the title khalîfat rusûl Allâh disappear only to reappear in the `Abbâssid era?<br />In the 3rd chapter, entitled \\"The Umayyad conception of the caliphate,\\" Crone and Hinds put forward their most controversial argument based to a large extent on an interpretation of al-Walîd's conception-namely, that the Ummayad Caliphs saw their caliphal stature as an office of religious charisma parallel to that of prophethood. More precisely, the caliphal era marked a new dispensation of divine charisma that succeeds prophethood: \\"Messengers belonged to the past; the present had been made over to caliphs\\" (p. 28). Utilizing heterodox stories wherein caliphal stature is embellished to rival that of both prophets and angels, the duo attempt to document their assertion averring, \\"As told, these stories sound like frivolous, indeed blasphemous, flatteries; but what they illustrate is precisely the point that khalîfa and rasûl were once seen as independent agents of God: that is why they are comparable\\" (p. 29). Muhammad, they argue, began to be spoken of as Prophet with a capital \\"P\\" as a means to diminish the centralized religious authority of the Caliph. The overwhelming, religious significance of the Caliph survives even in classical orthodox Sunnî literature. Caliphs are central to the faith both as they are 1) the defining figures representing the coherence of the religious community and 2) as the community's leaders, they act, even in error, as its principle guide. As such, \\"salvation was perceived as coming through the caliph\\" (p. 38), and \\"Like the pope, the caliph presided over a religious community outside which no ritual act had any effect... There was only one true imam and on true umma, so that whoever made the wrong choice would find himself outside the religious community where no amount of religious observance would save him from a Jâhilî death\\" (pp. 40-41).<br />According to Crone and Hinds, the Umayyads also reserved for themselves the prerogative of legislation. \\"Caliphal Law\\" as such represents the most archaic form of Islamic jurisprudence. However, this is not a mere assertion of an independent, secular law or extra-judicial arbitration in their view; rather, the early stage was \\"a stage at which God-given law was given by God-given caliphs\\" (p. 50). Moreover, \\"it is clear that the caliphs were free to make and unmake sunna as they wished... [T]he Umayyads concerned themselves with all aspects of the Sharîca, not just with matters of war, fiscality and other public matters\\" (pp. 52, 53).<br />Hind and Crone build on this to assert that the transformation from the concept of sunna as `generally accepted practice' to the more stringent and dogmatically weighty sunna of the Prophet is an artifact of the struggle for religious legitimacy that occurred between the emerging, piety-minded culamâ' and the Umayyads. Prophet sunna, therefore, was introduced in order to undermine the broad authority of the Caliph, and it did so in three ways: 1) by making scholastic aptitude a desideratum for delineating the contents of the sunna rather than the power of an office; 2) prophetic sunna is ossified whereas caliphal sunna is more malleable; and 3) the prophetic sunna is resistant to reinterpretation by the caliph being ensconced in juridical method and discourse, i.e., the caliph is deprived of his ability to define Islamic norms.<br />The Epilogue recapitulates the essential point of the work: the Imamî conception of the caliphate is more archaic than the Sunnî in the three respects of 1) being khalîfat Allâh, 2) having a salvific office, and 3) possessing the ability to proffer God-given law. Appendix A gives the date of the origin of the caliphate (aside from the propaedeutic Quranic back-projections of the title onto Adam and David) to most likely be with `Uthmân-the first Umayyad. <br />Whether or not you agree with the conclusions of the work, it still takes a profound step towards bringing to the surface the tensions present within our sources for early islamic history.	2004-04-17

Dividing his analysis of tradition into five chronological themes (attestation, preparation, revelation, persecution, and salvation), he examines each to show how in writing the biography of Muhammad the Muslim community was in large part also working through its own identity vis a vis Christians, Jews and the Arabian, Islamic milieu. In his last chapter, he offers some truly unique insights on the sira material by examining the numerological component in later Muslim attempts to date both the life and events in the life of Muhammad.<br />Rubin demonstrates the broad consequences of his study in the conclusion by exmaning the relation of what he postulates to be the predominantly early, indepedent evolution of the sira and the later integration of the Qur'an into the sira as 'asbab al-nuzul' (occassions of revelation) literature and ends finally with a few comments against the Scachtian thesis about isnaads. <br />The initimate familiarity of Rubin with the source materials appears often in his keen insights into the evolution of the texts and their influences making a reading of this work worthwhile even if one in the end may choose not to swallow every argument put forward.	2004-03-29

Syria, this work demonstrates, remained a problematic province for both the central Abbasid gov't and the governors whom it delegated to rule not only due its past status as the center of Umayyad power but also due to the precarious nature of provincial power itself, teetering precariously between appeasing both local elites and the central Abbasid gov't.  Syrain contention, uprisings and revolts are generally analyzed against the background of this precarious political structure.<br />Considering the amount of detail covered in this work, the author does a decent job keeping things organized and cogent in terms highlighting the overarching social dynamics and the various social actors--giving insight to multiple levels of society such as local elites, military elites, government servants and even unnotables.

After Asad's death, the succession of his son, Bashar, saw the ubiquity of his father's visage decline noticeably but still it did by no means disappear.  <br />Wedeen's work does forcefully and with keen insight what I once thought was impossible.  Though known to be patently absurd by all Syrians, inside and outside the elite, Wedeen argues cogently that this cult in its own way reinforces power for the state by demarcating the boundaries of political practice 'as if'...i.e., politics in Syria are to be practiced AS IF the cult expresses reality.  Her analysis also broadens to include investigations of the vast amount of state resources squandered on the cult and the circumscribed efforts to resist and protest the gov't.  Highly recommended reading for anyone studying the modern Middle East.	2004-03-23

As a specialist in Islam, I for one was sometimes left deeply dissatisfied by some of the sections focusing on Islam.  This, in turn, made me question the nature of the analyses on areas concerning which I have no indepth knowledge such as in Spanish and Portugese empires.<br />This being said, however, the general outline presented in the book as a tendency of colonial cultures with regard to legal institutions (from multi-centric and informal to strictly state-centered and enforced with centralized compulsion) is widely corroborated and extremely helpful in grasping the evolution and centrality of legal institutions in the formation of these colonialial and, subsequently, post-colonial cutlures.  The argument, therefore, makes great strides in supplementing merely economic historical accounts, such as dependency theory a la Wallerstein, with studies of colonial institutions as such and not as a mere apparatus of economic ideologies.	2004-03-23

What appears to me to make this work even more balanced and useful is the dialogue that Madigan often enters into with other classical Islamic sources while constructing his own independent position.  The discussion of al-Shafi'i's reatment of the Quranic trope &quot;al-kitab wa-l-hikma&quot; is particularly notable.  <br />The text itself is beautifully printed and includes both Arabic texts and translations of the sources quoted.  One could hope that the high quality exhibited here will quickly become the standard rather than the exception in the field.	2004-03-23

His documentation of the cultural logic and practice of Islamic law is fascinating and worth reading although it should be criticized that he too presumptuously seems willing to apply his insights into Moroccan society to Islamic Law as such.  In this sense, there is much to be learned from Rosen about the Moroccan cultural and social institutions of Islamic Law, but much less to learn with regard to Islamic law as an intellectual discourse as such.	2004-03-22

It is, however, not a book that seems to me likely to be read for eternity.<br />What I enjoyed most about was its fireside wisdom quality.

It is by no means a definitively new alternative course for critical theory.  It is nevertheless an enjoyable book full of numerous worthwhile insights.	2004-03-22

As such, it defies and even transcends the traditional hierarchy and divisions between the ethnographer and the subject of ethnographic observation/interrogation.  He does this by focusing on the life of and his encounters with the elderly Qadi of Bzu, with whom he develops a increasingly friendly and intimate relationship.<br />Beyond its intrepid methodology, Eickelman's picture of the order and system of the traditional reproduction of Islamic knowledge and its transformation in the modern period, stereotypical said to be a movement from chaos to order, has proved to be largely influential in other famous social histories-especially, for example, in the work of Mitchell and Messick.	2003-12-30

Those who are familiar with that work will most likely not be surprised by the arguments put forward here.  Much of the same methodology and argumentation are employed once again.  As for those who are not familiar with the previous work, I believe they will find that this book stands well enough on its own merits.<br />Berger's sociological approach to religion, although incomplete, is insightful.  He attempts and, I believe, somewhat succeeds to find a middle ground between ideational and materialistic approaches to the sociology of religion.  His focus remains consistently throughout the human agency in the construction of their social reality and how this reality becomes objectified and subsequently becomes reified as an immovable, impenetrable `thing' which is perceived as superhuman-and more specifically, the role of religion in facilitating and sustaining this very process.  From here, he moves on to the nature of this dynamic in modern societies, secularism and pluralism being shorthand for this, and the problems of social legitimation this entails.<br />Overall, this work is too cursory and pithy to be too satisfying for those who desire a robust sociology of religion.  As Berger states, it was not his intention to provide this.  Rather, one finds an exploration of how his prior work could be applied to the sociological study of religion.	2003-12-29

Most of this revolves around the treatment of the term &quot;mushrikoun&quot; throughout the Qur'an insofar as Hawting undertakes a great deal of equivocation of the term.  Insofar as the bulk of his books locates the impetus behind the chronicling of pre-Islamic Arabian cults with an unlikely narrow interpretation of 'mushrikoun' which he credits Muslim scholarship with imposing on the Quran--wrongly in I believe being that 'mushrikoun' was a term widely applied to anyone other than a Muslim both in the Koran and early Muslim works contrary to Hawtings claim--his scenario remains tendentious, unconvincing and speculative.<BR>Despite this deep flaw, the treatment of the material is fascinating and engaging as a whole--redeeming much of the books' flaws.	2003-11-20

That American scholarship has hitherto tended to neglect his work can evidenced in the absence of any mention of his work in such a recent and excellent work as Dutton's examination of Malik.  <br />Motzki successfully overturns the position of Schacht which has substantially dominated hadith and athar studies for over a half a century.  Though objections of Schacht's theses have existed they were either amateurish or piecemeal offering no alternative methodology.  Motzki here builds a new methodology employing an early text unavailable to Schacht, 'Abd al-Razzaq's Musannaf, and is thus able to change the tide of scholarship with a much more amiable and optimistic view of how much we can know about Islamic history from the 2nd half of the 1st century A.H. onwards.	2003-11-09

On one hand, Badiou appears as a sort of atheist apologist for Paul, whom he seeks to clear of common insults against his person popular since Nietzsche and others (such as being a mysoginist, a despiser of earthly life, etc.)  Badiou wants us to view Paul not in the popularized polemic distortion that pervades atheists in academia but rather as the prototypical 'poet-thinker of the event'.  <br />On the other hand, in so far as one can say this of Paul, Badiou wants to extract from his portrayal a revolutionary philosophy of 'the event' and its founding of universiality.  Here, the argument becomes complexly interwined with the words of Paul and Christian discourse; however, it brings with it a certain uncanny lucidity as the revolutionary universiality of the Resurrection in Paul's discourse sets the scene to disolve and overcome the particularities of the Judaic and Greek status quo.	2003-10-29

Rodinson is himself an atheist and a Marxist, and he, therefore, often frames the events of Muhammad's life within naturalistic explanations.  For this reason, it is not generally regarded highly by Muslims and banned from libraries in the conservative countries.  Reading the book, however, one finds little so scandalous as to merit such a melodramatic reaction,<BR>The two rival books aimed at this market are those by K. Armstrong and M. Watt.

This first volume focuses on Hodgson's justifications for his own idiosyncratic preferences which he obviously aspired to be broadly accepted in the field as well as writing the early history of Islam through the absolutist tradition of the Abbasid dynasty.  His awkward terminology has in general not been adopted although his insistence on rigor and uniformity in the transliteration of Islamic languages has become standard, and the general outlines of the history that he presents have stood the test of time.  Most may leave this book behind, being bogged down in the first hundred or so pages of caveats and academic hair-splitting; however, those who persevere onwards will find the going gets better when the actual history begins wherein the analysis and information conveyed are generally profound.<br />Throughout Hodgson's rather phlegmatic march through the history of the central Islamic lands (being Muslim Spain, North Africa, and the lands from the Nile to the Oxus River), there is undoubtedly a dusty quality to his work that shows his methodology to be at least a generation behind the times.  It is evident that he was influenced strong by the rise and fall of civilizations world history of the likes of Toynbee, and there is some indication that were it not for his untimely death that he would have wished to write just such a history.  Though this is a weakness in part of his work-weak because its broad strokes necessitates a glossing over many technical and philosophical issues (the devil and often the more interesting question are in the details)-it did at it time overcome many of the faults of Orientalist scholarship of and prior to his time by integrating Islamic history in the broader streams of human civilization with antecedents and inherited legacies rather than the usual misrepresentation of Islamic civilization as sui generis.<br />I still recommend Lapidus over Hodgson because Lapidus is more up to date, a single volume and bibliographically also more recent, although Hodgson's work has more style and continuity and coheres better than Lapidus's disjointed text.	2003-10-01

He has created a veritable inventory of scholarship, not coarsely comprehensive but pleasantly judicious, and accompanied it with a running commentary that places each work on the larger grid of modern scholarship on the subject as well and extrapolation of the various challenges realting thereto.  In this way, it facilitates a critical yet broad engagement with the important scholarship hitherto written in the field helping us to refine, reconsider, and reshape the direction of future scholarship.  Also, this work serves as an accessible point of entry for historians who specialize in areas other than Islamic history whom I trust will also find in plenty helpful.	2003-10-01

The basic thesis that this book puts forward is that Uzbek identity was not merely one which arose as a result of Soviet nationality policies starting in the 1920's but, rather, had its roots in pre-Soviet Central Asian intellectuals such as the Jadidists. This Jadidist movement, moreover, did not arise from Western sources but mobilized ideas recieved from cultural exchanges with other Islamic lands which were the filter through which Western ideas about modern and progress where encountered and are thus to be seen as yet another branch of the Islamic modernist movements of the period.<br />Particularly strong in this work, and what accounts for it broader significance beyound Central Asian history, is the account, applying the theories of Bourdieu, of the passage of Islamic learning from the pre-modern to the modern period and the concomitant transformations that it implies and the new dynamics which subsequently ensue thereafter.  These analyses within the first chapters of the book are surpass even the examination of the 'ulema'in Timothy Mitchell's COLONISING EGYPT.	2003-10-01

He aims at challenging two views prevalent (though quickly dying) of Arab nationalism: 1) that what occurred was an awakening of a perennial identity in remission rather than a construction of a national identity and 2) that intellectual histories of elites suffices to show the development of nationalism in the Middle East.  Using an uncanny array of sources, novel approaches to investigation,  and a particularly lucid picture of Syrian events of the time, he successfully demolishes both views.<br />What emerges in its place is not only more cogent and probable but also bespeaks the multi-layered experience of nationalism and mass politics as it developed in Syria as he narrates the dialectic between the top-down efforts of the Faisali administration to secure a broad and stable influence over society and various, polyvalent efforts of local popular committees to appropriate national discourse into their own emerging interpretations. <br />Gelvin's work should be read by any student of the modern Arab World.	2003-10-01

Rather being a bland, dispassionate catalogue of various views on ideology, Eagleton's book is a lively and even at time virulent debate with the long line of intellectuals who have sought to conceptualize ideology from the likes of Marx, Schopenhauer, Lukács, Althusser, etc.<br />At its core, the enterprise contained with the books stands as a defense of the Marxist critical tradition against post-modernism and relativism-meaning that he desires to preserve the notion of ideology as a critical device for emancipation from false beliefs and mental processes that reinforce social oppression.  Thus, after its initial chapters covering the usage of the term 'ideology' in speech and the social manifestations of ideological strategies, the Marxist debates take the forefront of the discussion almost entirely. In the final pages, Eagleton attempts to rebuff post-modern and neo-Marxist erosions of the viability of the concept of ideology.  If you never considered Marxism to be the school of thought with the most invested interest in preserving the notion of 'ideology', a reading of this book will suggest strongly to the contrary.<br />Eagleton has not only an incredible talent for not only conveying his argument in a lucid, witty and convincing manner, but also in presenting the position of diverse authors with whom he interacts.  He thus proves himself not only to be an excellent mind and author but also a superb reader.	2003-08-16

As the title connotes, this is done with a particular emphasis on how the CUP/Young Turks viewed the Arab provinces; therefore, issues surrounding the turkification (better: centralization) of the late Ottoman empire and its relation vis a vis nascent Arabism and fading Ottomanism.<br />Kayali forms his work as a counterargument against the view that would describe the reforms of the Young Turks as motivated by the desire for the aggrandizement of Turkish ethnicity and language--prefering, rather, to see the actions of the CUP as an attempt to centralize and consolidate Ottoman authority, albeit by employing the Turkish language and emphasizing Ottoman interests over local ones to do so.<br />A note on the inclusion of &quot;Islamism&quot; in the title: the author throughout uses the term Islamism in what would appear to be a anachronistic fashion, being that it is rather tenuous to speak of Islamism at all until after the Second World War.  Kayali plays fast and loose the term &quot;Islamism&quot; as meaning any gov't project that takes recourse to Islamic rhetoric.  It's inclusion and usage in the book appears, then, to be a gimmick.  Anyone looking for insights into Islamism, being mass populist political movements based on religious soiidarity, would do better to look elsewhere.	2003-07-27

In many ways it is yet another clone of the sympathetic approach towards both nascent and moribund Islamist movements.  Those who are well read in the field may find yet another standard attempt to answer the old question, \\"Is Islam/ism compatible with democracy?\\" tedious.<br />As a legal scholar at New York University, Noah Feldman is not by any means a mediocre scholar; however, his position does little to distinguish itself from the likes of Graham Fuller and John Esposito with the exception of a few personal features giving his position some idiosyncratic flair.  One, Feldman is an orthodox Jew who is pushing forward arguments always associated with a position (wrongly) stigmatized as anti-Israel and pro-Arab.  Secondly, he's incredibly politically active-having worked for Al Gore during the Florida vote recount and having been recently chosen [undoubtedly for his well-known expertise both in Islamic and American Constitutional Law] by G W Bush to help draft a new Iraqi constitution.  <br />If you are familiar with the often-repeated argument that the US is stuck between choosing whether or not to support the definitely-evil autocracies or the not-as-evil-as-is-often-portrayed Islamists, wherein the bloody fanaticism is depicted only as a passing tendency and not essential to the movements, then you can predict the outcome of Feldman's argument.  In other words, US foreign policy should be sympathetic to Islamists movements as social reformers.   Feldman is quite bold in claiming that we should encourage the emergence of `Islamic' democracies, which will not be secular, while simultaneously endorsing active US interventionism in the region into seeing it happen.<br />One cannot help but wonder if he is try to fashion this old position in scholarship, sympathetic to many [though not all] of the Islamists' aims, as an alternative to the political ideology of theneo-conservatives.

Donner's work provides an alternative, redactionary and critical approach to the rise of narrative and historical texts in early Muslim narratives to the `skeptical' approach-associated primarily with the like of P. Crone, M. Cook, and J. Wansborough among others.  In the end, he endorses a critical approach to traditional accounts of Islamic origins but one that does not reject its broad outlines.  Though this feature distinguishes and orients the argument of the book, it by no means exhausts the book's contents.<br />The main aim of the work is to address this straightforward question: \\"Why did Muslims begin to narrate and eventually compose history?\\"  His argument answers this question by examining the evolution of salient narrative themes that predominately arise as result of efforts to procure legitimacy.  Hence, the evolution of historical writing is pushed for by the function it serves for establishing the legitimacy of one or another groups' claim to legitimacy.  The resulting picture goes far in helping explain some of the odd idiosyncrasies of early Islamic history-e.g., the absence of chronology.<br />I found the general outlines of the book to be quite convincing; however, the devil is in the details, as it is said.  Critical examination of hadith may lead us to confer that it is plausible that the first four caliphs were Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali in that order, that the Battle of the Camel and Siffin occurred, but the details-copiously provided in Islamic tradition-remain highly dubious.  In this sense, the ramifications of the book's arguments, even if valid, are not fully drawn and remain open to investigation.	2003-07-01

Though short, this pithy little work remains important just by virtue of how widely read it is, comparable to the role of THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO to Marx's uvre.<br />The introduction describes this work as a bit of a manifesto, and indeed, its contents are written with such bravado and conviction, combined with a laconic lucidity and concluding summaries, which one would expect to see in a manifesto.  Being written by a scholar who has already written a decent sized book on Badiou, the introduction is actually key to the entire publication insofar as it situates the work itself and its author within the intellectual currents which produced both.<br />One becomes increasingly clear, however, is that \\"ethics\\" is throughout a word equivocated with the current global politico-economic system, which Badiou is really trying to subvert here.  Hence, he hopes to supplant this order, embodied in human-rights discourse, with his own neo-Marxist, radical politics.  His ethics is, therefore, an attempt to put the revolution back into \\"revolutionary Marxism\\".  Though ostensibly about ethics, this is, indeed, Alain Badiou's chief of concerns<br />Some of his ideas are ingenious, but others are a bit loony.  Predominant throughout is the theme of Truth as event which defines `the Good'.  This revolutionary intervention initiates and creates subsequently a truth-process which creates and ethical good as such.  Evil is not autonomous here but merely a perversion, abuse, or betrayal of the truth event.  This posits as the alternative to Kantian, natural law tradition which reifies \\"evil\\" and thereafter nihilistically, in Badiou's eyes, constructs a negative ethics that is essentially conservative.  Themes present in the works of Kant, Lacan, and L&eacute;vinas [whom he criticizes quite often rejecting his ethics of `the other'] often intersect, and they remain his main phantom interlocutors throughout the extended essay.<br />The interview at the end moves from issues particular to contemporary France like *les sans-papiers* and the status of immigrant communities to philosophical questions giving opportunity for caveats and discussions of other works besides *Ethics*.<br />Overall, Badiou offers some interesting ideas in this book, but writers such as Alisdair MacIntyre who are really concerned with ethics and not so much with reviving some nostalgic revolutionary politics offer much more enlightening critiques and examinations of modern ethics such as human rights, etc.often rejecting his ethics of `the other'] often intersect, and they remain his main phantom interlocutors throughout the extended essay.<br />The interview at the end moves from issues particular to contemporary France like *les sans-papiers* and the status of immigrant communities to philosophical questions giving opportunity for caveats and discussions of other works besides *Ethics*.  <br />Overall, Badiou offers some interesting ideas in this book, but writers such as Alisdair MacIntyre who are really concerned with ethics and not so much with reviving some nostalgic revolutionary politics offer much more enlightening critiques and examinations of modern ethics such as human rights, etc.	2003-06-25

His focus and approach is that of an anthropologist, hence the ethnographic character of the book; however, at the same time he maintains a keen understanding of both history and fiqh throughout.  <br />The locus of this work is nearly entirely dominated by the highlands of Yemen and Ibb, the location of Messick's own ethnogrpahic study.  Through the filter of Yemeni culture and the vast changes occuring there, Messick weaves a tale of what happenned theoretically, structurally, socially, politically, etc. to the practice of the Shari'ah within Yemeni society--oscillating between pre-modern, pre-bureacratic practices of the imamate, the effects of Ottoman reforms and the nationalist efforts at modernization.  <br />As is fitting in the context, a keen regard is kept throughout the work for the dialectial aspects of textuality and orality and how as the scales increasing tip in favor of textualized, bureacratic order Yemeni society is utterly transformed.

Piscatori I would roughly describe as a political scientist known for his work on Islam and the modern creation of the nation-state.  Eickelman is a long established anthropologist who rose to fame working in the Maghreb.  The resulting integration of both the politcal and the anthropological is about as ideal as one can get.  Since Islamism has the fascinating quality of not being merely political but also being a religious movement employing and revolutionizing the use of tradition and cultural icons of Islamicity, the perspective of anthropology as a part of any attempt to grasp its dynamics I have found to be crucial.<br />Here, you won't find the top 10 terrorist hit-list or a chart graph of all the members of Hamas, but you find a much more profound and broader picture of how tradition, religion and modern politics intersect with multifarious results in numerous global regions and some of the mechanisms at work.  In general, it is an excellent work for gaining the tools with which to critically approach such phenomena in various Muslim societies across the globe.<BR>all intersect	2003-06-09

Madelung's impressive work on the succession to Muhammad.  In short, Madelung's work far surpasses this one.<br />Granted, however, this work does not aim to do what Madelung sought to do.  Dabashi, here, focuses on Weberian theory of *charisma* and its subsequent routinization.  As such, the aim of author is to 1) expand upon Weberian theory of authority and 2) revise it insofar as the specificities of the period can inform and mature this theory.  In this, he more or less succeeds, and this has brought his work broader appeal outside the field of Islamics than, for example, Madelung's source-heavy study.  To summarize the book, three trends of authority appeared after Muhammad's death as a way of continuing his authority that would profoundly impact and guide the currents of Islamic history thereafter.  These three are the Sunni (institutional), Shi'a (individual), and Khawarij (negational). <br />Though the theory is more or less solid, the approach is methodologically sloppy-movements appear to at times to be given more cohesion and definition than they really had.  Anachronisms abound.  Mostly, these appear throughout as a tendency that comes all too close to a picture wherein these three currents of authority formed instantaneously after Muhammad's death.  Much  of this also arises from the fact that Dabashi's work is also quit weak when in comes to sources and citing evidence to support many of the sweeping generalizations that are made concerning the period in question.<br />This work will most likely be more enjoyed by the sociologist of religion than the historian.	2003-06-03

Books	4	32	36	N	N	Theology for Marxists, Atheists and Agnostics	A self-described \\"fighting atheist,\\" though not a very conventional one, and an avowed Marxist, though not a very typical or orthodox one, iek writes rooted deeply within Lacanian psychoanalysis in order to produce some of the most intriguing, bewildering, and relevant philosophy concerned with post-modern conundrums such as relativism, agency, and subjecthood.  <br />iek in this work embraces the shared Marxist and Christian messianic visions of history as an alternative to both the post-modern, New Age-Gnostic moral sludge dominating PC culture and the excesses of capital.  The true heart of the work-and its most convincing parts as well-occur mid-way through in iek `s treatment of Pauline agape vs. the Law/Sin  dialectic as it relates to modern human rights.  More or less, this is a desperate attempt to revive Marxism as an alternative to Liberalism.   Good Luck.<br />iek writes in a frenetic, gregarious style that is endearing but not necessarily rigorous.  His penchant for citing movies, novels and popular culture besides the likes of Schelling, Lacan, Hegel and Heidegger lightens the atmosphere, but the problem is that many things that he says, many conclusions he arrives at from overly generalized instances of cultural practice are just blatantly false.  Also, it can be annoying when he rambles on for five pages about a movie you've never seen, thus, making any attempt to understand his point tedious. [Recommendation: definitely make sure you've watched Hitchcock's VERTIGO before reading this book].<br />For me, iek is one of the authors with whom I part ways with on the big questions but with whom  I often side with on the smaller questions.  His acuity in the realm of cultural interpretation and his applications of Lacanian psychoanalysis to politics are both haunting and memorable long after you've finished the books.  Re-reading this book, I came across this passage in footnote #12 that sent shivers down my spine with it's accuracy.	2003-06-01

Though ostensibly a work on historiography, this meta-topic is explore through the various alleyways of other disciplines such as politics, theology, history of religions, ethnology and psychoanalysis.  <br />Its diverse topics reflect the diverse interests of its author.  Undoubtedly, the fascination with ethnology is a reflection of de Certeau's earlier aspirations to be a Jesuit missionary to China.  Part of this work bears the mark his interests while pursuing his doctoral degree at the Sorbonne where he studied the origins of the Jesuit order in the 17th century.  <br />This is a disparate book, made of disjointed sections, which only interact with each other loosely under the umbrella of `historiography'.  The first part of the book is more focused on historiography proper-the nature of making history and the making of history that necessarily occurs from the `place' of the historian and is shaped by his `archive'.   In the following section, details of 17th century European religion serve as the locus of a larger discussion on what it means to write a religious history and a history of religion-elucidating the relation between ideology and religious belief.  Then the transition is made to concerns of ethnology, alterity and semiotics in the economy representation and its narrative.  The book concludes with a discussion of Freud and religion, taking on the two subjects of his approach to possession and his work Moses and Monotheism.<br />The general conclusion of the work is that a self-/place-conscious history is best (one that is not blatantly ideological and one that is not naïvely positivistic either) through throughout the course of the book many other theme, sub-themes, etc. are unpacked.  Though average length, it's a dense work bound to effect how anyone who reads it writes, approaches, and understands narratives of the real.	2003-05-31

I met him in Yemen and he struck me as an acute, level-headed scholar.  His position is contrary to &quot;post-Islamism&quot; or &quot;failed Islamism&quot; model which basically states that the Islamic trend has reached its heights already, failed miserably and has nothing more to offer.  The bombastic, vulgar displays of force we see now, from this perspective, are outgrowths of the frustration resulting from this failure.  Finally, his work, previously only available in French, Islamise en Face, has been made available and updated in English.<br />Burgat's thesis, to the contrary, is that Islamism is essentially nationalism bathed in religious.  Therefore, Islamism functions as a type of ersatz nationalism, replacing failed nationalist projects [mostly socialist] and claiming to restore cultural authenticity. I don't buy it [can't account for Pan-Islamism and unjustifiably reifies political aspects over religious ones], but he makes probably the most convincing argument out of those scholars that push forward this view.  <br />Much of the work that is particular valuable draws upon his extensive field work and experience in the MENA region.  The excerpts on Rashid Ghannouchi, Adel Hussein, and Tariq al-Bishri are good as well.	2003-05-27

John Voll's preface to this reprinted edition is excellent and gives the work its due place in the history of the development of scholarship on Islamism.  <br />Mitchell's work preceded the sensationalism so characteristic of the field today and, therefore, lacks many of the vices present therein today.  In particular, one notices his consciousness that he is studying a *religious* group; therefore, his work doesn't suffer from the rampant reductionism that seeks to explain Islamism merely in terms of market fluctuations and changing birthrates.  As Richard Mitchell wrote just before his death, \\"So deeply ingrained is secularism as to make even the most sympathetic observers floundering for meaning in simplistic explanations such as `Mahdism,' `Messianism,' `religious obscurantism,' `fanaticism,' `nativism,' `cover for power grab,' etc.  All of these things exist in the Islamic movement.  But it would not be a serious movement worthy of our attention were it not, above all, an idea and a personal commitment honestly felt.\\"  <br />Mitchell's works shows how Islamism began as a relatively conservative movement without any explicit aims for revolution at the governmental level.  Rather, they desired a religious revolution that was later protracted into a larger arenas of social reform.  Political opposition and activism-of the potentially seditious kind-actually came relatively late and in the atmosphere of despotic monarchy.<br />The books ends with the imprisonment of the Brotherhood by Nasser-ironically after the Brotherhood provided the major popular support for the Free Officers to enter into power-and thereafter the history of the Brotherhood was chronicled mostly by francophone authors such as Olivier Carré and Gilles Kepel.	2003-05-26

Mostly, however, this work is a poorly written book with a novel thesis that has been adapted and put in a much more rigorous scholarly study by Gilles Kepel.  <br />Admittedly, there is something `catchy' about his writing.  Roy assures us that the inner contradictions of this movement will collapse in on itself and inadvertently cause the secularism that all of the bourgeoisies have come to enjoy. <br />The weaknesses of this work as a piece of scholarship are many, but I'll the two principle ones.  For one, it is methodologically contradictory.  As is customary today in Mid East scholarship, he disavows Orientalist sins by claiming there is no such thing as a monolithic Islam only a plurality of Islams, then he goes on to state that political Islam is one of these \\"Islams\\".  Oddly enough, though spanning multiple continents and a multitude of countries, he seems that he believes political Islam IS a monolith.  By the end, the picture that results is that of monolithic, triumphant modernity mocking an impotent, fanatic, and frustrated nativist politics.  <br />Secondly, any glance at the bibliography would reveal that Roy's work is more or less a hodge-podge of secondary source material-not even a wide spectrum of sources are used and many are journalistic in nature.  A lack of knowledge of requisite languages is apparent as he makes the classic mistakes of doubling Arabic plurals, butchering Arabic phrases, and outright mis-translating words.<br />Though oddly famous, this work is mostly a waste of time.  For francophone scholarship, there are much more worthwhile scholars such as François Burgat and Gilles Kepel.	2003-05-26

However, given that the new information handled by B. Lia offers merely a refinement of our understanding of the Brotherhood rather than a radical revision, one is recommended to rather begin with Mitchell-whose book is available in paperback, is more established, and is a fraction of the cost.  Contrary to D. Pipes' and others' reviews, Mitchell's work does not portray the Muslim Brotherhood as reactionary.  This rhetorical device of point, counter-point does considerable injustice to Mitchell's work.<br />Standing on its own, this work is well written and easy to follow.  Lia is able to delve into the mechanics of the organization on a social and political level in order to reveal just how it reached the amount heights of success that it did.  The result is a picture that explains well why it was a model so extensively copied and exported throughout the Muslim world.  If there is any comparison to be made to Mitchell's work, this would certainly be the proper feature to focus on.  Overall, Lia gives a much more lucid, detailed account of the Muslim Brother as a social organization and makes a convincing case for the organization being the first grass-roots political movement in Egypt with its origins and leadership from the poorer classes [unlike the Wafd].  What is lost, however, is comprehensive picture of the whole-and this due partly to the limited time frame of the study-wherein the Brotherhood's other distinguishing features [e.g., its religiosity, transformation during political persecution, etc.] are obfuscated.	2003-05-26

Kepel was more or less the first scholar to frame \\"Muslim Extremism\\" as 1) an extremist phenomenon and 2) a real political threat to the region in such an explicit fashion.  As such, this work has been much debated and criticized; however, it still remains a classic in the field.<br />Ideally, Kepel's work should be read in tandem with Mitchell's work on the Muslim Brothers as Kepel himself seemed to see this work as the follow-up to Mitchell's groundbreaking work.  Mitchell's work stopped at the incarceration of the Brotherhood after the Free Officers now longer found their support politically desirable or expedient, and basically, Kepel's picks up at that point-the inhumanity of the prisons, the gallows, and the torture rooms.  <br />Unlike Mitchell's work, however, Kepel's study is not confined to a study of the Muslim Brotherhood but is a study of the  radicalization of the Islamic trend in Egypt which splinter into many factional, competing parts-at times as a result of state initiatives as under Sadat.  The differing policies of the Nasser and Sadat regime are compared, the influence of Sayyid Qutb emphasized, the moderation and political compromise of the Muslim Brotherhood emphasized, and the desperation and impoverishment of the violent groups such as al-Jama'at al-Islamiyyah and Takfir wa-l-Hijrah are cited as their sources.  These all became classic themes in the field.  Kepel's work demonstrates that the sources of political Islam are as varied as its social manifestations.	2003-05-26

In  it, he fuses the Hume's theories of religion with ibn Khaldun's cyclical view of history with its tense dialect between the nomadic and sedentary forms of  human existence whereby he constructs an ingenious account of pre-modern Muslim Society.  Also interesting is his discussion of how this oscillating pendulum has in a sense become `unhinged' since the advent of modernity.  Classic reading.	2003-05-26

Unfortunately, the flurry of sectarian debate has overshadowed a work of great scholarly importance [exhibit a: the reviews written prior to this one] by an author who himself-as far as anyone can know for certain at least-had no intentions of propagating one tradition over the other.<br />The virulent Sunni opposition of the Sunni Muslims to this book relates mostly to the portrayal of Abu Bakr as a schemer, Umar as a bullying hothead, and Uthman as a rich fat-cat with a taste for nepotism while Ali is the rightful heir to the prophetic office.  That is what the offended would get from the book.  Actually, Madelung has a much more nuanced opinion of all the Caliphs which is the product of a mixture of deep admiration and criticism.  Most frustrating to the Sunni Muslim, I would imagine, is how Madelung version of the events makes such ideas as ta'diil al-SaHabah wa-l-taba'iin, al-fitrah, etc. seem absurd and untenable [which many more progressive would admit are].<br />Most problematic within the work is the use of sources throughout.  I don't mean this in the sense conveyed in the ramblings of one reviewer [\\"Dr. Siddiqui\\"] who seems to lack any coherent understanding of textual dynamics involved within Madelung's various texts.  For example, just citing a text does not equal an endorsement thereof; rather, what is important is how the text is integrated into the larger structure of the argument and how controversial texts are placed within a hierarchy of certitude and historical criticism.  Madelung here is about as meticulous as one could be.  Moreover, he has to be for he write *against* the pro-Sunni grain of almost all of what has been written in the entire corpus of Western scholarship hitherto.<br />Madelung, in reality, is a rather conservative scholar.  His approach is optimistic-meaning that he doesn't side with the skeptical branch of scholarship that rejects all the details and accepts reluctantly, often with extensive revision, the general outlines of the Muslim historical record.   After all, ALL of the sources we have today on these events were written/compiled hundreds of years after the events they claim to record while simultaneously be the result of considerable political tumult.<br />Whatever side of these debates you fall, one has to admit that Madelung has written the most authoritative and interesting interpretation of the sources hitherto committed to writing.  The case he makes from the Qur'an for Muhammad having intended Ali to follow him as the leader of the community is very crafty.  His portraits of the intricacies of tribal conflicts and personal ambitions are masterful and stunningly lucid.  Under his pen, these complex events regain a certain new-life.  By the end of the book, Madelung makes one realize how astonishing it was that Muslim history actually took the direction it did, albeit while slaughtering many `sacred cows' in the process...	2003-05-25

The entire work is loosely an examination of the secular as an epistemè and secularism as a political doctrine respectively as well as the interrelation between the two.  Asking what an anthropology of secularism might look like, he avoids being bold and shuns an attempt to actually construct one.  It's a concept that he's flirted with before in GENEALOGIES OF RELIGION, but any attempt to construct a magisterial theory are absent.  As a work overall, the end result is a disjointed collection of previously published articles inter-mixed with new ones; however, it is worthy mentioning that even the previously published articles that reappear in this work we significantly revised from the original-at least the ones I was familiar with.  Nevertheless, this doesn't detract from the collective value of the book.  All the ideas he puts forward are cogent, probing, and provocative.  <br />His leading contribution is in the area of how secular discourse is perceived from the periphery of the modernization process-a periphery that `doesn't fit' into the metanarrative of Amero-European modernity since the Enlightenment.  Thus, the conluding essay on the transformation of law and social ethic in colonial Egypt is alone worth the price of admission.  His treatments of human rights, agency and pain, cruelty and torture, and Muslims in Europe best demonstrate the feasibility of employing anthropology as a disciplinary lens through which to scrutinize modernity and its `essential' components [esp. secularism].<br />Asad crosses the barrier of viewing the secular simply as the mere `separation between church and state' and enters into territory where questions can be posited such as `what created the historical moment which made possible the thought of secularism?'  As such, he rolls back the shiny veneer of modernity to unravel thethreads of  it inner fabric.  Thus, he facilitates the process whereby we can shed facile questions like: \\"when will Muslim societies secularize?\\"-moving on to questions that inquire into the historical processes that formed the secular/human subject of normative modernity in Europe.  Localizing European/Western experience in such a way, a more lucid account of the advent modern society, state, religion, etc. in its non-European manifestations becomes increasingly attainable.<br />Though rhetorically convincing, there are parts of the book that remain tendentious at best.  In particular, this goes for his arguments for secularism origins lying in the modern cleavage between private morality and public law.  Systematic delineation of the two spheres is actually quite old whether one refers to the Christian or Islamic tradition-just to mention a few examples, one could take the ETYMOLOGIES of Isidore of Seville or the various Muslim jurists extrapolations of the principle of \\"al-amr bi'l-ma'ruf wa-l-nahy `an al-munkar\\" (i.e., commanding the good and forbidding the wrong).  Hopefully, fuller elucidation will more fully distinguish these pre-modern conceptualizations from their distinctly modern (and secular?) configurations.	2003-05-24

What is also unfortunate is the inaccessibility of Schacht's text  due to the large volume of material that he handles.  Moreover, his citations are merely referenced rather than being extensively quoted.  Many of his citations are difficult to obtain readily as well since they are comprised of extremely old sources and different versions of those very same sources.  Overall, for over 50 years, the theories of Schacht, building on those of Ignaz Goldziher 50 years before him, remain basically irrefutable insofar as key sections of his theories are materially, historically and textually substantiated.<br />al-Azami's book is an incredible resource for two reasons: 1) he quotes in both Arabic and English what Schacht mostly on cites and 2)it is perhaps the most substantial response by a scholar of the Arab Worlds 'ulema' to a piece Western scholarship.  Note, this 15 yr. old book has not as of yet been published in Arabic, neither has Schacht's work. Before I left Egypt this year, one of my professors had the manuscript for the Arabic translation [of al-Azami, not Schacht] of this book--meaning that the only Arabic-speaking speaking scholars will only be able to read the polemic, which is unfortunate.<br />al-Azami goes through Schacht's work in detail, but he just doesn't seem to 'get it'.  By 'it', I mean the methodology embodied in Schachts work of critical scholarship.  There seems to be a lack of understanding of what compromises evidence and proof.  For example, al-Azami consistently uses texts written hundreds of years after the texts and people being discussed.  The problematic of the hadith is never grasped fully.  [to give everyone an idea, the hadith where not committed to writing until 200 yrs. after the fact ... like if we had just started to produce historical records of the Americanrevolution today].  Nevertheless, al-Azami remains a scholar worth reading, although if one is interested in a radically revised and much better approach to hadith, one would be best helped examining the works of H. Motzki.<br />Schacht's work is controversial to Muslims because as al-Azami states, there is a fear that he is trying to destroy the basis of their culture and civilization.  The contrary is actually the truth.  Schacht was a scholar that actually highly valued the system and genius of the Islamic tradition of law; however, he viewed this tradition as a HUMAN tradition.  Schacht's criticisms of the origins of Islamic Law proving that it is neither prophetic nor divine but simply human does not destroy a civilization or tradition but opens it up to revision and modernized based on reason rather than religious fanaticism.  And, indeed, this is the modus operandi of the original modernist reform movements in the 19th century Mid East.	2003-04-25

Books	3	46	50	N	N	Slightly dull sequel to AFTER VIRTUE	This so-called sequel to After Virtue is heavier in both its abstruse argumentation, erudition and physical mass.  In many ways, it lacks the excitement and provocative character of After Virtue, and its contents are much more specialized. One can feel this particularly in the heavy treatment of Homer, Aristotle and Plato, which is neck-deep in linguistic hairsplitting over the precise meanings of Greek words.  For those readers with scant interest in the classics, the first part of the book, despite its many gems, tries one's patience.  <br />The overarching thesis of the book is sound nonetheless.  To give a very basic outline, MacIntyre traces several traditions, broadly being the predominant Hellenist and Christian ones, before moving on to establish liberalism as its own  tradition.  Not every philosopher is give exhaustive or detailed treatment.  Aristotle, Plato, Augustine, Aquinas, and Hume are the real stars here.  The Scottish Enlightenment is dwelt upon in much detail to explain Hume, so other important philosophical movements such as British Empiricism, German Idealism, etc. are marginalized.  Despite these omissions [the book is long enough as it is], the central thesis coheres nicely and arrives at its conclusion in a most decisive manner.<br />Though MacIntyre's thesis that liberalism itself constitutes a tradition may seem tame, taken into proper perspective, it is actually quite revolutionary.  Considering that modernity [à la Descartes] rejected all appeal to tradition and sought to construct a purely rational account of the human and his society and to, thereby, construct a utopian future applicable to all times and places, to claim that it is itself a traditional is a smack on the face that effectively historicizes the Enlightenment tradition.  Therefore, justice and rationality-in other words what is proper action and what are the proper reasons for acting-must be understood through the historicized lens of the context of a specific tradition that any ethical discourse plugs into for its legitimacy.   <br />The book concludes with a cogent discussion of the nature of traditions, their birth, evolution, death, and how we can understand the nature of our own beliefs as being a part of tradition.  The key, determinant events in these narratives are `epistemological crises'.  MacIntyre tries to makes the case that Thomism has hitherto best weathered the tests of time.	2003-04-18

Islam) in the Middle.  While the unsecular <BR>character of Mid. East Societies, in this case Egypt, and their<BR>affinity by so-called violent religiosity has been attributed to a<BR>primitive mentality of the people, cynical demagoguery by politi-<BR>cians, angst-ridden youth, disillussionment of the middle-aged, <BR>poverty, anti-Western hysteria, and rage arising from political im-<BR>potence and failure, Starret gives an alternative account that is <BR>actually convincing. He does this by drawing the roadmap between<BR>the sensationalist events such as revolutions and assassinations<BR>by examining how the religious citizen is constructed through <BR>national discourse, with a specific focus on the development of<BR>Egypt's educational system from Muhammad Ali's transformation<BR>of the kuttab to later permuations under the British, Nasser, <BR>Sadat, and onward.  The result is a highly believeable account of <BR>the salience of religion and religious conflicts [of all sorts, <BR>not just the less-interesting, violent ones] in the country inte-<BR>grated with the national changes in thinking with regard to such<BR>subject as mass media, religious authority and the market. Thus,<BR>the works offers numerous keen insights into the reproduction of <BR>Islamic religiosity and its transformations in Egypt today through<BR>the various interplays between power and public culture.  His <BR>anthropological-historical approach is a fresh and welcome one.<br />An editorial criticism of the book as whole: the Arabic throughout<BR>is atrociously transliterated.  I ended up making notes in the <BR>margins of my copy to make phrases written in Latin script intelli-<BR>gible.  Particularly, iDaafa constructions are not written, hard-<BR>letters are not distinguished from soft letters, long and short <BR>vowels are not differentiated, and sometimes letters are just out-<BR>right confused (e.g., dhaal and Zaa').  With relatively standard-<br />ized options of Arabic transliteration out there,this book is just <BR>sloppy and amateurish in its final edit.  Perhaps this won't <BR>bother those who are ignorant of Arabic; however, for those who <BR>are familar with the language, it's a continually frustrating <BR>blemish.	2003-04-17

The author protracts his study of the slum to encompass anthropological contributions to understanding Gramscian hegemony, nationalism, colonial histories, formation of new, post-traditional elites, and subaltern resistance.  Most useful in this book is the account of the construction of Muslim national identity and the account of the elections in the late 80s wherein the Muslim and Islamist participants made an unexpectedly poor showing giving most of the victories to Christian candidates.  Parts of the book are uneven; however, the account is consistent to his methodology from the outside and he allows the information to lead him--always be circumspect that ideology or presuppositions don't lead his interpretations by the nose at least in matters of peasant politics.  In other words, the peasant remains an autonomous political actor that doesn't merely parrot and conform to the requests of the socially more advantaged.  <br />The most glaring flaw in the book was what I personally found to be an over-identification with Muslim Filippinos over and against Christian Filippinos.  Armed separatist movements are portrayed sympathetically, whereas 'Christian' efforts, whether in terms of national integration, militant attemtps to stop succession, and even charity are treated as all being pernicious acts directed against Muslims.  One example was the characterization of Mother Theresa's charity for children in the city as being 'perverse' without any such acerbic criticisms for the vicious effects of separatism movement and the deaths it caused given.  The same goes for foreign actors.  In the work, American actions in the Philippines are sinister and undermine Philippine Muslim identity; whereas, Libyan, Saudi Arabian, and Egyptian interference are merely catalysts for social change.	2003-04-14

This is a hefty statement that I personally believe can be significantly substantiated as credible being that the traditional secularization thesis has been entirely debunked; however, I am unsure how less sympathetic readers will react to this premise.<br />If we are to talk about the 'revival' of religion, albeit while recognizing it really never went away, are we to speak of the re-appearance of pre-modern forms of religion?  Running along the theme adopted in the introduction of the evolution of ROMEO &amp; JULIET pre-modern to modern to post-modern (Luhrman's) productions, Ward argues convincingly in my opinion that this is not the revival of pre-modern phantasms of religion but rather the emergence of a trangsgressive, excessive and hyper religion.  This he notices can be seen in the the kitsch Holy Land Theme Parks, inane fundamentalisms, the commodification of religion through the media, etc. <br />'True religion', he argues, must not be understood as something fixed but as something created---as it was when true religion first became a matter of unique attention after the Reformation---through social process and cultural permutations.  'True religion' is disseminated across social and historical process in the discursive exchange of signs throughout cultural networks.  Such is the general pace of the book which could frustrate some in how it skirts a direct, lucid confrontation with the issue of there being a 'true religion' as the question would be understood by the vast majority of the non-academic public.	2003-04-07

Ward unfortunately quickly moves from asking questions relevant to a great deal of Christian peoples like \\"What does it mean to be a Christian living in contempary urban settings\\" to entertaining flights of fancy revolving around questions of semiotics filled with post-modern jingoisms and pseudo-jargon without really making an compelling case for the connection between the two.  The result is rather frustrating and makes much of writes unenlightening for practical theological concerns for Christian living.  Ward obviously is more exhilirated about the idea of writing a theology of signification than of writing a theology of cities, for he spends much of his time addressing the former rather than the latter resulting in a seemingly endless discussion of irrelevant topics related merely to his own person theoretical interests such his much overplayed treatment of sexuality.<br />This, however, is not to berate the analyses that are present within work.  It is clear that the relevancy of a theology of signs for the city arise for Ward from viewing the urban landscape as a type of text [an annoying tendency of bookish post-moderns who have read so many books that they start to think that the whole of existence is a text]. What is written about his theology of signs-or the ability to give a Christian reading of the [cultural] signs of the times-has a stimulating applicability to the notion of urbanity and Christian community and even newer concepts of modernized space such as those posed by our living much of our lives through the medium of cyberspace.  His scholarship has wide-breadth and proves much more conversant in secular critical philosopher than many of more parochially minded theologian companions.  Ward really does have a message to set forth upon the table for debate with many lucid observations worthy of consideration.  In the end, his is a strong indictment of the cold, secularized universe that the decaying enlightenment tradition and its nihilistic detractors are shoving down our throats.<br />This work is eclectic drawing upon various sources ranging from obscure theology and philosophy to mass media [I was annoyed that he repeatedly misspelled the Wachowskis' name when discussing the Matrix-revealing he's not really so ultra-hip as he would like us to believe] and at times is very abstruse.  It is hard to imagine it being of any value to anyone outside the academic or well-educated population.  Nonetheless, it does provide a hearty alternative to the acquiescent and stale Christians portrayals of the city as one can find in the now defunct writings of Cox on secularity.	2003-02-23

Here, Zizek focuses on the relation between fantasy and desire, and the latter he sees as rooted fully in the former.  Fantasy, he argues, is the foundation for political and social action.  As a Marxist, he makes an interesting some interesting arguments along a line that is seemingly contradictory to his ideological convictions employing Lacan heavily but also drawing upon and offering some interesting interpretations of Hegel.  He ends the book with insights on how the digitization of our universe--overly fantasized--as alienated us from our corporeality.  This he views negatively as a plague--finally suggesting that the task of critical theory is the inverse of the traditional one starting with concrete social reality and then moving to abstract notions.  Rather, the pseudo-concrete and virtual which now structure our lives must be debunked.  His writing is erratic but intrepid and certainly worth the effort.	2003-02-18

The period is interesting in itself because it marked the end of the classical period of Islamic history and was both the site of both political decline and a cultural bloom.  Mottahedeh's approach is straightforward, dividing the book into basically two parts.  The first addresses acquired loyalties of a formal nature and the the second addresses categorical loyalties of a more informal character.  His insights are too numerous to elucidate here because of the various levels of society he examines, but his examination of the ulema I found to be worth the price of admission alone.  The overall picture, however, is a fascinating one of how during a period of immense upheaval a new Muslim society emerged with self-renewing and self-preserving values and institutions starkly different form the Abbassids period preceding it which also continued centuries after its disappearance.	2003-02-18

This work circumscribes science and seeks to be a contribution towards shedding some megalomaniacal ambitions of scientism, which in the tradition of Comte, raises science to the highest order of knowledge.  He accomplishes this on many levels--explaining what the grand Theory of Everything that physicists dream exactly would constitute [not much really, just a mapping out of atomic particles, not the meaning of existence], discussing the relation of magic and science, examining the meta-science [basically, epistemology] that undergirds and makes possible empirical science qua science as usually understood, and the relation of science to life's mysteries, such as the mind, art, and morality.  <br />Ridley shows a good knowledge of both his own scientific discipline [Physics] and contemporary philosophy and integerates the two well, a rare quality.	2003-02-15

Most interesting are the final chapters on the conditions needed for a democratic polity and the responsibilities of the individual in a system of democratic citizenship.

Write perhaps the only work on one of the most salient Islamic practices throughout history in a contemporary, quickly changing Muslim Society.  Gaffney builds a basic typology of three types of preachers: the traditional scholar and ethical teacher, the sufi priest-magician, and the militant holy warrior. He analyzes sermons from all three and the religious aura and authority they carry with them in society.  Gaffney demonstrates the authority that the preacher embodies in the larger society are closely connected with mundane institutions and organization of the society. He argues this both in the context of Cairo and Minya [which much more rural than Cairo]. Many of the sermons discussed were given during the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, and through them Gaffney traces the development of this militant movement and compares it with official Islam. Overall, this analysis cover ~2 decades of field experience, in the 70s and 80s. Finally, Gaffney presents and analyzes three actual sermons in their entirety, transcribed from recordings made in the mosques. Some of his insights are profound but I found myself annoyed by common debunking of the preachers' sermons.  The author is a catholic minister [though also a professor at Notre Dame], and there are moments where there was a bit of unnecessary digression into Christian apology.  This was frustrating insofar as I was more interested in an analysis of the symbolic appeal containned in the preachers' sermon rather than a correction of the factual errors contained therein.  Nonetheless, it was an interesting approach and the first of its kind.  I believe it would be fortuitous to do more studies of its kind.	2003-02-07

The argument is convincing, but it is still incomplete.  There is virutally no treatment whatsoever of the changing economic realities the region experienced in the 19th century.  As a social history, the work distances itself from the Marxist model, but unfortunately, this distancing resulted in neglect in terms of economic structures of Mt.

I could tell by the details in the book that this guy was indeed legit.  He's not a liar, and he is indeed who he says he is.  The book, unfortunately, is a poor guide for thinking about Islam and terrorism.  The writers Azhari education reveals little about his knowledge of Islam and much about the sub-par level of education in the Islamic in general even at the levels of high education.  I am a Christian who reads Arabic and have dealt extensively with the texts involved.  I know that he doesn't fabricate information at any point, but the key is in the presentation.  This can be shown in any Jew-bashing portrayal of the genocide-endorsing, mysoginist Old Testament that neglects the jurisprudential and theological matrix within which these verses fit.  Muslims will be repulsed by this book and outsiders with malicious intent towards Islam will find plenty of fuel for the fire of their hate.	2003-01-31

This is, thus, no comparative history but a Buddhist slant on Eckchart's thought and spirituality.  It is a slant that might make some Christians uncomfortable but it is interesting nonetheless.

I found myself that I enjoyed those chapters more in which I was more familar with the texts and ideas being studied.  Other parts of the book left me wanting to do more background reading.  It is obvious that Milbank has an incredibly erudite knowledge of both theology and social theory, and it seems to me that this a text that can be quite easily misunderstood.  For the patient, however, I believe that its contents are a powerful message for Christian theology that just now seems to be able to see itself as philosphically on par with the Enlightenment tradition and its successors beyond apologetics.  Milbank's critique the servility of theology behind the profane narratives of humanity and history and ends his work with the articulation of a Neo-Platonist, Christian alternative.  Of course, it pisses some people off, since it refuses to bow to popular assertions such as &quot;Christianity is a tool for supporting and promoting patriarchal domination,&quot; and other such tripe.	2002-12-10

For a book as short as this, it is inevitable that the work will only scratch the surface.  Cook does a good job of putting in secular language how one can approach the Koran as a book and as the centerpiece to the Islamic faith.  He writes in inverse chronological order, starting with the modern and ending with the opaque early history of the Koran.  This is neither a guide to reading to the Koran nor an interpretation of its contents, but rahter, an anecdotal presentation of many topics relating to its contents.  For an introduction to the Koran, it is rather disappointing in the end in terms of offerring a strong list for further study focusing on various topics.  Much of this is not Cook's fault so much insofar as few interesting works address the Koran at a layman's level and usually tend to be quite technical and assume at least a cursory knowledge of Arabic.  Also missing unfortunately is a good summary of some of the modern trends in literary and historio-critical approaches to the Qur'an though some mention is made of Wansborough (about a paragraph).  Overall, it's an accessible read that is likely to inspire further study...

This makes him perhaps one of the most difficult but most enjoyable reads out there in the cultural criticism market.

Though somehwat controversial, Kepel has produced quality scholarship with an eye for detail for a long time and is well-known and widely recognized scholar in the field.   Islamism has become over time a politically moribund ideology driven more by desperation and disillusionment than by anything resembling political success or ascendency.  He covers all the major topics and personalities--not nearly enough for indepth study but that's not the purpose of his book--and has a talent for connecting the dots of the international scene, thereby demonstrating the geopolitical nature of the movement despite its diversty and diffuse organization.  While some may be taken aback by his assertion of the 'failture' of Islamism in light of the extreme actions committed, he nonetheless makes a good case for argument not equivocating politcal failure with political impotence.

Though a certain way of thinking and approaching the texts is explored that is itself dynamic and inspiring, it fails to be more than merely rhetorically convincing.  Strangly, Girard claims throughout his text that his observations and interpretations are neither apologetic or biased towards Christian interpretation but, rather, scientific.  While it is plausible that the scientific side of his argument has been established in greater detail by those that endorse his theories about mimetic desire culminating violence in human societies and as the foundation of human society, it's not contained in these pages.  Nonetheless, this still serves as an interesting introduction to Girard's ideas being both short and straightforward.	2002-12-07

This book has its weaknesses throughout due to the very nature of the enterprise.  It's all too easy to point out what such attempts to give comprehensive histories lack.  Nonetheless, out of all the books out there, I recommend Schulze's book more than any other because it avoids sensationalism and the essentialization of Islamic history.  Moreoever, it presents Islamic history in th idiom of political modenrity rather than in mediaeval throwbacks that are not sufficient for explaining polyvalent nature of modern Islamic history.

Whichever way we approach fascism we find that  it is simultaneously on thing and the contrary, it is A and not A.&quot;  <BR>Passmore's book takes the tone of this passage and writes his book re-affirming the above.  He seems to masterfully handle all the problems and hazards of his study able to articulate a concept of fascism that makes room for both its modernity and anti-modernity.  Not just an historical survey, it is also a presentation of common elements of a widespread ideology.  This book is as fascinating as it is eye-opening.  Very well-written.	2002-11-23

Anas	Dutton's work is fascinating for numerous reasons, but the most prominent among them is the amount of detail spent in examining the jurisprudence of the Medinans, specifically as represented by Malik.  I found much of what Dutton wrote to be healthy balance to some of the more extreme interpretations of Goldziher and Schacht insofar as Dutton is able to supercede the naivity of the current traditional approach to hadith among Muslim scholars of Islamic law while simultaneously integrating the conclusions of critical scholarship.  Essential to the work and one of its main contributions as well is the treatment of the Qur'an as a source for jurisprudence and legal reasoning in Islam alongside the sunnah, 'amal, ra'y, etc.	2002-11-20

It is perhaps the most lucid presentation of post-liberal theology and one could also say the radical orthodoxy school of cambridge.  2. It's short.  Many of the ideas here are difficult, but they are argued well while giving a sympathetic hearing to skeptical outsiders.  This is a work that deserves to be read multiple time until one gets a handle on the exact line of argument.  As such, it is a groundbreaking, methodological work.  It's indispensible for anyone interested in doing any kind of theological dialogue, whether inter-faith or intra-faith.  I write this as a Christian student of Islamic studies who found the cultural-linguistic model of religion and religious discourse endorsed here by Lindbeck illuminating for my own studies of Islam and investigation of inter-faith questions.	2002-11-12

It's not a bad resource to use while writing a paper, but you won't find any revolutionary ideas here.  I found reading it to be a dreary bore and frustrated by what seemed like a forced effort to name the Muslim Brotherhood as the vanguard of civil society in Egypt.  Being that civil society is a popular catch word in Middle East Studies these days, it is only natural that scholars come along and try to equate civil society with the non-violent Islamist violence.  The problem is that the Brotherhood has never been a paragon of tolerance, democracy and pluralism--just look at how the organization is run.  Moreover, I found it shocking that the work failed to discuss the Center Party despite the amount of time discussing the Muslim Brotherhood.	2002-11-12

Essentially it works because it has a gimick--being that it focuses on Islam in two cultures that are vastly different from one another.  Indonesia and Morroco are at oppossite pole of the 'Islamic World' and the practice of Islam in each respective country are even farther apart, in the traditional sense.  Geertz shows that while these two cultural manifestations of Islam may seem infinitely divergent from one another, they are nonetheless connected and complimentary.  While this book now shows its age and has its weaknesses, it's short and contains many insights that make it an enjoyable read.  It makes for a good partner to engage within scholarly dialogue while at the same is and equally good partner for casual reading for those with just a general interest in Islam as a cultural phenomenon.	2002-05-18

One can spend hours working through the footnotes alone.  On that note, one should mentioned that K. A. El Fadel genuinely tries to present each perspective on a topic.  He doesn't decieve his Western audiences by concealing the ugliness of much that exists in Islamic tradition and he doesn't shy away from criticizing many of the sacred cows of his fellow Muslims.  In many ways, I found reading this book to be much like peering into the modern condition of religious authority in Islam.  El Fadl doesn't paint a pretty picture, but he does demonstrate that there is hope, and the juristic tradition, as moribund as it may at time seems, shall likely continue into the future though in a radically transformed way than its previous incarnation.  <BR>Some criticisms of the book are his awkward attempts to merge insights from Western philosophy with Muslim tradition.  Thinkers such as Muhammad Iqbal proved long ago that this can be done with grace and skill, but El Fadl does so awkwardly at times.  It seems  that these elements remain unmixed like oil and water despite various attempts.  Also, I wish he would have desisted from always using the Wahhabi CRLO as his main polemical opponent.  There are so many other fatwa bodies, international ones at that, that I found this decision to be rather odd.  Moreover, I would have liked to have seen a deeper examination of the historical contingencies surrounding these fatwas to be explored.  Nonetheless, it's without a doubt a must read for anyone interested in American Muslim scholars.	2002-05-02

Egypt as the home of al-Azhar as Islam's most prestigious instution of traditional Islamic learning and the [now disupted] leader of the Arab-World is a an excellent location for the study to take place.  The author effectively places the rise of the Dar al-Ifta in the context of Egyptian Islam, International Islamic bodies, and the modern crisis of religious authority facing Islam today.  In addition to this, his examination of the careers and fatwas of Egypts most famous Muftis, Gad al-Haqq and Sayyid al-Tantawi, is excellent and quite useful.  Recommended for those interested in Islam in Egypt in particular, but this work would also be useful for a general study of Islamic authority in practice [as co-opted by a modern nation-state in this particular case].	2002-04-30

He demonstrates that he is a rare and gifted scholar with an awesome ability to intregrate vast seas of thought into one coherent whole.  This work covers \\"Commanding Right and Forbidding Wrong\\" from its origins in the Koran up until modern times, though he focuses upon the classical period throughout the vast majority of his book.  All sects with a significant body of material are represented.  Why this topic?-- Basically, this doctrine has historically proved to be the major foundation of any Islamic social ethic; therefore, how it is concieved usually predetermines how one thinks justice ought to be established in this word or by whom it should be established.  Cook possesses a talent for giving seemingly distant and irrelevant doctrines a timely relation to today insofar as his studies illuminates how two different cultures approach moral actions in their respective societies.  Parts of this book are vast and copiously detailed; however, it was exhaustively documented and extremely efficiently organized throughout.  Thus, it is enormously accessible and immensely useful for reference as well.  The high price is unfortunate, but it is without a doubt worth the money for anyone interested in Islamics.	2002-03-25

She assumes that her readers may or may not know a good deal about the subject, which makes her writings both engaging and appealing to general audiences. My main objections to her work arise in two categories. One, there is a general failure to recognize the multiplicit dimension of these movements. They are neither totally united nor of totally similar dispositions. While skillfully showing the unique and similar nature of revivalism in the three monotheistic religions, her folly is found in over generalizing the other faiths. This is especially true of Christianity-the religion who she treats with the most harshness. Two, she attempts to polarize modern religion between two camps of backward, militantly insane revivalists one hand and on the other the progressive liberals who are the bastions of human decency. This is a distortion and a great weakness of her book, truly bringing to service her agenda. Nice read though, but it should encourage further reading if prior reading has not been done upon the subject before reading this work.	2002-03-19

One would recommend before reading this text having at least some familiarity with the Islamic tradition and modern Islamic history, however.  Brown himself demonstrates an excellent familarity with the sources he examines and languages and contexts which produced them.   He focuses mainly on the two intellectual powerhouses of modern Islamic thought, Pakistan-India and Egypt.  His conclusions demonstrate that paradigms that placed tradition and modernity diametrically opposed to each other (cf. W.C. Smith) are erroneous as tradition can also be a conduit for profound social change as is the case with Islamic tradition.  Moreoever, he argues forcefully that modern approaches to tradition and religious authority are born out of a confidence that Islam is growing stronger, not from a fear that it is threatened by a tide of modernity and progress.	2002-03-10

How unfortunate it really is that this blemish taints an otherwise excellent collection of essays.  This books is a mere 145pp.  The previous reviewer inaccurately stated that the author's intention was to prove that there is no such thing as Islam but only Islams, which is a bad reading in my opinion.  The presupposition is there, nonetheless, and al-Azmeh obviously considers speaking of Islam outside a specific spatio-temporal context a fruitless enterprise outside the context of theology, which is a reasonable observation.  The danger, he asserts, is that in the context of history and social sciences speaking of \\"Islam\\" as a category is frustrated by its generic and protean nature that, in turn, subjects it unfairly to the use and abuse of the bias of those who wield it.  I have personally seen al-Azmeh lecture at the American University in Cairo and I must admit that I was thoroughly impressed by his eloquence and scholarship.  While it must be admitted that the language of this book is opaque at times, his style is nonetheless (I find) not too difficult to become comfortable and given a little patience even appreciated.  Overall, I found this book to contribute incredible insights into how one should approach Islam in light of modernity and the current state of the world.  Indeed, I found this work much more immediately relevant to the field of Islamic studies of the modern Muslim World than Fazlur Rahman's ISLAM & MODERNITY.	2002-03-01

Nothing will be too surprising to you if you are familar with the thought.  However, if you are not familar with these trends, this brief book serves as a good introduction since this is about as lucid and comprehensible as works of such a predisposition tend to get.  The author shows an excellent exposure to recent post-structuralist thought and english literature on the Middle East and Islamism; however, his engagement with Islamism leaves much to be desire as he apparently knows neither modern Arabic nor Persian as his bibliography and use of texts demonstrates.

The strongpoint of this work is that it firmly accomplishes its intention of demonstrating that not only are Khomeini's fundamentalism and other Islamic fundamentalisms compatible with modernism and not archaic, but that these movements are only made possible by modernity.  This is especially true in his examination of Khomeini's revolutionary ideology in Iran and Iran's subsequent existence as an 'Islamic' nation-state.  Zubaida, I feel, took his conclusion too far at times and exaggerated the secular side of these religious movements throughout nonetheless.  Perhaps the most notable occurence is when Zubaida precariously identifies these relgious movements with nationalism and thereby tries to tell us that these movements only happen to be inspired by Islam.  This is a major flaw which neglects a key aspects that fuel their proliferation and continuance.	2002-03-01

This books conclusion says, quite eloquently, that mission and militant and political expansion work on completely different levels in history though at times mission becomes blurred by the latter, either through demogoguery or by its culpability in its endorsement and support of colonialism and/or imperialism.  This is an interesting book which succeeds foremost in demonstrating that christian mission is pluriform, not exclusively European and not always attached to political ambitions of conquest and expansion.	2001-12-22

Throughout, the book bases its arguments solely on evidence of which there is a paucity for this time period.  MacMullens strength however is beyond the examination of the evidence.  He appears to set aside any attempt to spiritualize this time period or romanticize the practice of Xianity therein.  Some his statements are surprising (e.g., that ater Paul, there is virtually no evidence of itinerant evangelism explicitly aimed at UNbelievers/ NONchristians), and most of these are arguments from silence though very probable in light of other evidence.  Overall, this work is thorough, concise, and respectable.  It achieves an examination of the early Christian faith as history while repudiating any attempts to use the primitive faith as a modern pulpit from which to preach. The book is quite concise, but its contents are so pithy as to prove to be an inspiration and guide for much further investigation.	2001-12-22

For such an aim, this volume is particularly helpful.  It perhaps does about as good of a job as I would imagine possible of measuring the process and degree of secularization that transpired in Britain, France, and Germany up until the beginning of the 20th century.  What this book says is important: 1)secularization looks different and means different things in different time and places despite the unified character of the phenomenon, 2) it is also the choice of a society conditioned by its historical experience, and therefore 3) it cannot be said to be a consequence of modernity and thus a presupposition thereof.	2001-12-04

The previous review suffices, but I just wanted to add a note about the work's content. During my first reading, I thought that the work was overly bogged down with a discussion of education and its development throughout Pakistan, Turkey, etc. However, upon a second reading, I found this to be the most profound and impactful section of the work, as this is the locus of the true reform of Islam and its true modernization will occur. Thus, this work is partly a late scholar's dream for the future of his religion. Though at the same time, it is deeply grounded in history and its realities.	2001-11-25

He deals excellently with the conundrums involved with comparing andencountering competing claims of religious truth and the ability of humans to find warrant to choose to believe one or the other.  Admirably, he treat the religious traditions featured in his work fairly and even-handedly.  He has taken great care not to misrepresent any tradition, and before publication, he employed the criticism of many experts in revising his work where it contained any fallacies concerning non-Christian faiths.  While some criticism of them is present in his work, he never takes the tone of a polemicist.<br />His book begins with an examination of the general epistemological difficulties accompanying claims of revelation and then moves on towards specific examinations of Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and a special chapter on Christian revelation and our belief in God's Incarnation.  His last section works out the conclusions of his examination and one is left with a strong argument for a non-provincial theology but, if one is a Christian, a strong grasp of how the doctrine of Incarnation makes Christianity as radical and distinct as it is.<br />Though I didn't agree with him on many small details, I found his general framework to be solid.  I highly recommend this book for any Christian seriously wanting to explore revelation in the context of pluralistic market of religions in our post-modern societies.	2001-07-07

Still, I think I have some important statements for readers out there who have not yet encountered this book.<br />The title, Mere Christiantiy, is really key.  While many conservative evangelicals, who often lack a real encounter with the deeper Christian theological tradition present in works by such men as Niebuhr, Tillich &amp; Barth, may present this book to you as THE definitive argument for Christianity, he/she would be in error.  Indeed, this is not the author's intent whatsoever.  Rather, this book is to serve as a mere cursory introduction to what he sees as Christian orthodoxy, or gestalt if you will ---being the elements present and preserved throughout the faith's history.  In some way, he fails @ this task showing that he himself was not immmune to the prejudices of his time (e.g., passages that present the man as 'head of the household').<br />Also, Lewis was neither too liberal nor too conservative, though he was certainly traditional.  He certainly was NOT fundamentalist or evangelical (e.g., he did not adhere to the plenary, verbal inspiration of Scripture).  Thus, to read him as being an adherent to this flavor of Christianity is to MISread him.<br />Of course, this book has its apologetic elements, and of course, it is not exhaustive.  Lewis is not trying to subjugate all of our doubts to the mastery of his arguments.  He rarely was so arrogant.  One must read this with his attention in mind--- to explain mere Christianity will simultaneously showing it to be reasonable.  And, he attempts to soften some of what to outsiders may seem as rough edges and succeeds quite often with amazing fecundity.  <br />Despite the impression some may get from the strong recommendations given for this book (and it is indeed a classic), it is best not to assume that this willbe the end all to searching.  Mere Christianity serves best to introduce an ignorant person of the beliefs of Christianity when knowledge is lacking and to aid the believer in understanding his own faith.  For those who would want to encounter more developed, firm arguments and/or have travelled further down the path of intellectual development, this book can't harm, but there is much more to be sought out.  For a strong apologetic work, which is more contemporary yet still becoming dated itself, I recommend Hans Küng's ON BEING A CHRISTIAN.  This work is rather large, so for a smaller volume, try Keith Ward's GOD, FAITH &amp; THE NEW MILLENIUM.	2001-05-20

To be specific, Khalidi situates the crucial years during the late and post-Ottoman period in Palestine.  The author is not a primordialist, but rather, he is a constructivist.  Taking nationalism as peculiar phenomenon to modernity, it locates him in a precarious position in which to create room for his argument, for he insists that Palestinian identity can be seen as a process which could have potentially evolved w/o Zionism as its interlocutor (though, of course, it did not).  His arguments and presentation are masterful. <br />Recommended for anyone who studys the area and/or conflict, essential read.	2001-03-24

Not only does it cover a wide range of topics, its contributors come from a variety of backgrounds.  It is niether centered on Western Christianity nor is it overly dogmatic.  Particularly I was impressed with the tact with which hotly debated issues were presented (e.g., abortion, homosexuality, etc.).  Moreover, it is extraordinarily accessible while remaining engaging.  The articles are written excellently with further readings provided at the end.  It's an impressive accomplishment that I would whole-heartedly recommend to any Christian from any background.	2001-03-19

Though the Rev. Tom Marshfield is utterly despisable, he is also completely endearing.  The prose is masterfully written.  I only found it difficult during the first 3 pages.  Updikes knowledge of theology impressed me, as well as his indepth treatment of the subject.  Updikes juxtapositioning of sex (seen usually as profane) and theology gives this novel its unique edge.  Highly recommended reading for anyone who has dared to ask the hard questions of religion and to search them out, and has suffered morally and spiritually as a result.	2001-03-17

This book's effort to examine the rise of Iranian natoinalism in terms of land and cartography are unique.  The author takes the &quot;Map&quot; of Anderson's &quot;Census, Map, and Museum&quot; and runs with it.  The *frictions* on its borders arising from international intrigue, from the Qajars to the Pahlavis, set the stage for  *fictions* of nationality and unity.   Of course, as any specific book like this would be, it can be quite dry.  At no time is it @ all exhilirating.  I would recommend it only for those highly interested in studying modern Iran and how modern historiography is to be applied to examining its birth.	2001-03-17

Bringing together a wide range of authors, this makes a wealth of information accessible in one volume (from history to cultural heritage/contributions to demography to recent emigration, etc).

Her research is admirable as well as her clarity.  However, too often she failed to make connections intended to formed between her ideology and research.  There are a few key, general criticisms I have.  The book has poor understanding of the term &quot;subaltern&quot;, misidentifying it with social groups which are not. Ironically, she neglects to discuss one social group under the mandate totally, the Shi'a, thus, reconfirming their subaltern status. Morever, though she claims to have done so, she fails to say anything meaningful or significant about Islam whatsoever.  Also, events and individuals are not often historicized enough in that background events are neglected  and omitted which are key to understanding the time period.	2001-02-22

At times when fundamentalist Christianity has flooded popular understanding of Christian eschatology, Moltmann succeeds at presenting a real attempt to come grips with Christian beliefs about the consumation of all things.  One could only wish that the theses and propositions in this book could gain a popular following outside academic circle as well.<br />Moltmann is an eclectic thinker who enters into dialogue with various thinkers from Bloch to Washington to Hegel to Fukuyama, etc.  His style is highly readable while remaining profound.  This work succeeds best in integrating various traditions throughout history into a new, better-informed presentation.  A number of perspectives are included into dialogue with the Christian one: rabbinic, philosophical, and political.<br />Moltmann also roots himself strongly within biblical parameters while simultaneously dealing with the quizical difficulties involved in drawing conclusions from such a varied document.  Overall, this work will perhaps prove to be the most valuable theological treatise on eschatology one-hundred years from now.<br />Recommended for interested lay people, pastors, students, and seminarians.	2000-12-22
US	52507985	R2DUCONLT7HGZE	0415194873	749775437	Comparing Religions Through Law: Judaism and Islam	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Disappointing	This book does less 'comparing' than I expected.  3/4 of the book describes explains the religious law of Judaism &amp; Islam independent of any attempt at comparisons; thus, it reads nearly like two parallel books.  To be fair, each chapter does end with an overview of material covered, pointing out similarities, but this is usually only 1 or 2 paragraphs long.  Nonetheless, the other 1/4 of the book achieves some interesting conclusions and, I feel, makes the book worthwhile.  <br />Sonn and Neusner set the parameters of their study within 'classical' Judaism and Islam beforehand. Though this itself raises many questions, they provide a sound justification for this approach in the opening pages that, even if you disagree with their starting point, makes the entire enterprise of this book intelligible.  Neusner and Sonn both wrote the book well; however, I feel that Neusner quoted large, extended passages from the Misnhah and Talmud too often, which interrupted the flow of his presentation, and Sonn depended too much on secondary sources, which causes modern views more palatable to Westerners to dilute her presentation of classical Islamic law. <br />I enjoyed a good part of this book, but like I said above, the failure of the majority of the book to 'compare' disappointed me.  Nonetheless, this work is a wonderful contribution, and reading it should be quite fruitful to understanding both systems of religious law.	2000-12-04

At times, the book can be daunting; however, for the material it covers, it is often suprisingly readable.  It is great a launchpad for a multifarious number of other studies because it integrates and discusses so many other concerns.  The charts, graphs, and tables which are employed generously are helpful as well.  Overall, the book succeeds well at being balanced, practical and straightforward about the problems facing the Middle East, including their source and future.<br />Recommended for students and professionals seeking specialized knowledge of the M. E. which presents a solid framework for seeing the interelatedness of many aspects of Mid. East society.  Casual readers will be overwhelmed by it analytical style and attention to detail.  A general knowledge of economics as well as politics is of course recommended before reading this as well.	2000-11-25

It surprised me, however.  Once again, it made me rethink the trends of Egyptian society and Islam.  Mrs. Abdo is amazingly persistent in gathering the information for this book. As an expatriate living in Egypt with a first-hand observation of how difficult the society can be for Western women, I was in awe at her achievements.  <br />Her portrait covers the slums to Imbaba to the elite of the American University in Cairo and Egyptian hollywood, and she provides interesting vignettes of each sector of society.  I do wish she would have been a bit more comprhensive.  The influential and visible Coptic population of Egypt remained on the margins.  One cannot expect too much, so perhaps she fealt this was not a part of her analysis.  Nonetheless, if you are fascinated by the Mid East and modern Egypt, you will enjoy this book heartily.  It is readable and very accessible to the average reader.	2000-11-25

Well-organized and concise, this work presents lucidly the unity and differences between the dominant Shi'a tradition (i.e., Jafari) and the four Sunni schools (i.e., Hanbali, Hanafi, Shafi'i, and Maliki).  <br />This works focuses merely on the presentation of opinions and civil matters and religious ritual (e.g., marriage, inheritance, salaat, zakat, etc.), so anyone seeking to gain any knowledge about usul al-fiqh (legal theory/methodology) and the continuing relevance of Islamic law to modern ecomnies and states should look elsewhere.  Muslims will find it practical in their daily acts of faith.  Non-muslims will find it fascinating and a good reference for answering question regarding religious duties of Muslims (e.g., who is qualified to recieve the alms-tax?).	2000-10-24

Particularly interesting in this book is Hallaq's treatment the birth of usual al-fiqh and its modern interpretations.  Reading about the pre-modern zenith of Islamic jurisprudence, which Hallaq completely identifies with the work of al-Shatiby, one becomes totally skeptical to the applicability of Islamic law beyond the realm of religious ritual.  However, Hallaq captures well continuity and ingenuity represented in recent reforms achieved by two groups which he will label in the last chapter of his work as the utilitarians and the liberals.  <br />The weakness of Hallaq's work is that its contents are unbalanced.  I wish more time was spent on the formation of fiqh and the justification of its existence.  Nonetheless, his treatment of these topics is solid.  This work can be a little tedious @ times, but usul al-fiqh is itself tedious.  In the whole spectrum of the book, one realizes that this itself is part and parcel to the reform occuring today.  Excellent work but by no means a decisive study to answer all questions-too short.	2000-10-24

For this reason, texts written before Sander's work or texts that neglect his study seem to be outdated and obsolete.  While some revolts in American scholarship have occurred since this book was written (e.g., Crossan, Borg, and the Jesus Seminar), the foundation of this book have remained firm and unshaken.  The primary reason for this is Sander's moderation and erudition.  He distinguishes very well between what we can and cannot know about Jesus and is not given to speculation.  <br />The most powerful result of his book is how he brings to light why in fact Jesus faced opposition and eventually suffered martyrdom.  This he does through an articulate examination of Palestinian Judaism in the 1st century and a scathing critique of past scholarship which generally failed at doing this task.<br />Recommended for those who are seriously searching for the history of Jesus and his society.  Casual readers who do not have much background in this field will be perplexed or overwhelmed.	2000-10-20

Though the multifarious writers in this collection are not often liberal in the occidental sense of the word, they are surely progressive.  Many are heterodox, many are key in intellectual and social revolutions, and overall, this is a wonderfully diverse and important sampling of a variety of Muslim thinkers.  This book shows well the diversity and upheavel occuring in the rethinking of Islam in these times.  <br />If you believe Islam to be a backward, anti-progressive religion, this book will shatter your mistaken stereotype.	2000-09-24

This a must read for anyone who seeks to familiarize his or herself with the OT and contemporary dialogue upon its contents. Brueggemann's book begins with at look past efforts to create a theology of the OT and present approaches to the text from leaders in the field. Even the first couple hundred pages make the book a worthy buy. It's introduction and presentation is excellent. The main content of the book takes a strikingly different tone, which casts off historical-critical details (but not the conclusions therefrom) and succeeds in presenting the testimonies of Israel in the OT. Cautiously attempting not to be too reductionist, he achieves an impressive accomplishment of showing the cohesive unity of the OT in its message.    The dynamic I mostly enjoyed in this is work its ability to force you into facing some of the most haunting, exhilarating, and troubling aspects of Israel's testimony.  <br />Also recommended: Other Brueggemann books of interest and much short: Prophetic Imagination and Hopeful Imagination.	2000-09-24

I even enjoyed R. Niebuhr better than Tillich and Barth.  His erudition and conclusions are powerful and engaging.   I recommend reading this for those familiar with political thought and philosophy of the modern era.

Also, it is highly readable for a history book.  Of course, it can get dull at times just as all really detailed history books must, but this work remains highly lucid throughout.  The strongest breakthrough of this book concerns its treatment of the Arabization of Middle East and the developement of what we know as the modern Arab identity.  However, to typify in a few sentence as book of this scope is impossible.  Once you read it, you will find yourself going it back to it again and again for reference and for understanding modern events.	2000-09-24

Books	3	33	44	N	N	Good Introduction to Pauline studies	I am a avid fan of N.T. Wright's writings on the New Testament.  He has proved himself to be an excellent source for a balanced and critical scholar who is not afraid to go against the grain.  As we await the 3rd volume of Christian Origins, promised to be written about Paul, this is a decent foretaste.  I enjoyed the book but gave it three stars for the following reasons. The title is really misleading.  It was not so much about the answering the question present in the subtitle.   He writes only his last chapter addressing this question in response to A.N. Wilson's popular, though flawed, biography of Paul. Secondly, I was disappointed in the amount of detail and comprehensiveness in the book.    If you're a beginner in Pauline studies, I recommend this book highly.  It discusses the main issues of Pauline studies concisely and clearly and points one to further studies.  If you're anxious to read Wright's 3rd volume, you should wait a little longer.  This book will disappoint you -- unless you're looking for a light weekend read.	2000-09-24

The book's strength  is that it is comprehensive, covering the wide range of manifestation of  Islam in the modern world from the 18th century onwards-even with a short  introductory chapter to get you up to pace from Islam's advent.  However,  though it is a must read for scholars in the field, this Georgetown prof's  writing style can make what I find to be one the most exciting historical  movements in human history very dry and dull; therefore, I gave it 4 stars  instead of 5.   He has no flare or excitement, especially when compared  with such excellent writers as Karen Armstrong.  Nonetheless, if you study  or are seriously interested in understanding modern Islam, this is a must  buy.  If not, buy the Battle for God by Karen Armstrong and get 3 religions  for the price of 1.	2000-09-19

For one who  wants to begin with taking a look at real scholarship and not metaphysical  fairy tales about Jesus, it's hard to find a good place to start.  Before  this book was published, the best introduction was The Jesus Quest by Ben  Witherington III, which looked @ the many modern scholars of Jesus  scholarship.  Its weakness was that it summarized views in Witherington's  words which were often harshly critical because of his evangelical bias.   Borg is the 'liberal' and is a powerful representative for the camp.   Wright is the most exciting scholar right now who powerfully supports and  challenges orthodoxy simultaneously.  Wright is the superior scholar here  in my opinion, but the great thing about the book is that you can decide  for yourselves looking at the authors' own writings.	2000-09-19

Foremost among its flaws is that it fails to incorporate German Orientalism.  This negelect, admitted by Said, brings into question the whole project and argument in the estimation of some.  Nevertheless, Said's arguments on the relationship between knowledge and power, colonialism and the construction and formation of the counter-factual, foreign other remain intact despite the distortions and exaggerations within this book.  In other words, if one so desired, one could entirely rewrite Said's book from the ground up without its flaws and with a more comprehensive scope and arrive at basically many of the same conclusions.  <BR>One can decide to judge the value of the book by its influence and the subsequent emergence of post-colonial studies following its publication, or one can decided to view it as a work on the merits of its contents.  From the former perspective, this is a work of indisputable importance.  From the latter perspective, this is a work that though engrossing leaves much to be desired becuase it fails on various fronts.  Despite those failures, much of Said's argument remains intact.  Anyone who does read this book and study his arguments cannot help but to be effected by the arguments presented.  After Said, the study of other cutlures can never be viewed in the same light.	1999-10-06

Skeptics may not like his obviously critical approach towards much of the scholarship that he presents; however, this is without a doubt the most conservative-friendly introduction there is out there.  The greatest strength about Witherington's book is that it can appeal to conservative Christians and open many up to critical scholarship--I've seen this happen ot many friends to whom I've loaned the book.  Thus, it is a great door through which to walk into the larger world of NT biblical criticism, which I believe has a great deal of potential in tempering some of the extreme, ridiculous tendencies present in conservative Christianity.	1999-10-06

I came across this book during a time in my life when I was about to give up my Christian faith.  It brought me into a fresh, living perspective and out  of narrow fundamentalism once and for all.  Though in his examination of  Jesus' time, he tends to be too stereotypical in typecasting groups in the  Jesus' time, it is an amazing paradigm to view Jesus from.  I would  criticize the overly eschatalogical vision he has of Jesus that he seems to  get from Schweitzer.  Lastly, his understanding of being a Christian as  being radically human is beautiful and moving.	1999-10-06

The main one being that African Religion is among  the world religions.  African religion cannot be a world religion because  one: it has no canon or standard text, is culturally bound, and three is  barely cohesive.  He continues to examine tribes randomly to support his  view, but the question is in your mind, &quot;Is he making the evidence  fit?&quot;  The actual conclusion chapter is only a few pages long.
