Juliette Monroe has been living in fear for eight years married to an abusive and mentally crazy husband.  Now, over a year running from him, she and her son Billy meet Nick, good cop promising her and her son that he will do anything to keep them safe from her crazy ex David.  After being released from jail on bail for holding the tiny tot daycare center hostage, Nick and Juliette begin a long journey of disovery, of courage and of hope of the future and the love that develops between these two in the most stressful of situations.<br /><br />I loved the characters in this book.  They were all very well written.  The book had a really great sub-plot about Nicks brother and Diane the the love and heartache the three of them shared and lost.  This is a lost and found book.  Losing things but finding things all over again.  A book that I just could not put down.  You will cheer, smile, get angry and cry.  I read this one in a day!  You will too.	2005-02-08

My only bad thought about this book was the first five or so pages were a little cheesy and almost made me put the book down....but get through them and a great book awaits you.  The sex was a little less poetic and more aggressive than I noramlly read, but it was an overall great read.  I look forward to reading more my this author!	2003-11-03

I didnt' have a problem with her being a virgin and inexperienced but Hope's character was not weak!  Some of the love making was borderline nasty and not romantic and the ending (the gang) made me laugh out loud....a little stupid to me but very entertaining!!<br />I enjoyed this book I guess mostly for Hope's character and her strong sense of self....	2003-09-28

It's a little too over the top in some ways, the dirty cowboy bum riding the trains around who happens to be a millioniare!  But when I read I want to escape to places and with people who are a little over the top.  That's the great part about losing yourself in a good book!!  Maggie character was so clear, Anderson describes her and her background that you feel you know her and what she has been through.  One of the strongest charcater I have read.

Ellie's character is strong and bold.  And I really liked Dan, the ex-New York cop.  I loved the description and detail Adler gives to everything to make it come to life on each page.  The only thing I didn't like about this book was it seems to go back and forth a lot, which is not bad at all but just something I am not used to reading. It was a very fast read.

It uses a much different approach to language learning that I had never seen, but it's very easy to catch on.  It's big on not pushing the knowledge but rather letting it flow very easy.  And I think that is the best way to learn!	2003-06-12
US	42333102	R3NVVN8JLHE9AW	0373482337	389250905	Skin Deep	Books	4	2	2	N	N	entertaining read	When Chatel, a big Hollywood movie star begins to receive obsessive phone calls and letters, she hires Quinn, the five hundred a day bodyguard.  He is watching out for her while the staker gets closer and closer,  the heat between them turns red hot. This book was a fast and entertaining read.  Not the best by Nora but not the worse by far.  This is the third book in the O'Hurley series.  I would recommend this book because it is a very fast read.	2003-06-10

One is about Olie, Zowie, Billy and Olie's dog Spot!! This set also comes with some very colorful sticker too!!!  My son loves this collection. The books are very colorful!  Each book has a cute little rhyming story about each of the characters.  If you have an Olie fan out there this collection is a must have!	2003-06-04
US	42333102	R2Q80TOBUZWRED	0373218540	185425774	Dangerous	Books	4	4	4	N	N	2 out of 3	I enjoyed the first story \\"Risky Business\\" in this collection. It was a good story and I really got into the characters. What a character Liz was!! She is such a strong character that risked everything to care for her child. It's so amazing to read. \\"The Welcoming\\" was also a good story.  It's about Charity who owns and runs an inn on an island off Washington State.  Roman is a agent set to check her out.  It's about love, honor, family all rolled into one.  I really liked this one a lot, especially the ending!  WOW!  I just wish it was a little longer in length because I didn't want it to end.	2003-05-30

This was my first Macgregor series book and I really enjoyed this one!<br />This is the story of two very different people who live across the hall from each other in a downtown New York city apartment building....She is a cartoonist and he is a play write and part time musician.....Their connection is vivid and well written....I loved when she follow him to the blues/jazz bar!!  Funny and sad at parts and a very good ending....<br />I would highly recommend this one even if you haven't read any other Macgregor series book before....this one stands on its own!!!	2003-05-27

I just couldn't get into the characters. I liked Del...but couldn't get a solid picture in my mind which doesn't happen very often when reading Nora's books....Cam was ok but typical....it was a fast read and I really liked the ending...the characters fought throughout the book...but it was a very romantic ending! It is worth the time but not her best work....	2003-04-29

US	42333102	R1COOLRGQ2QG0W	0399149392	363923998	Chesapeake Blue (Quinn Brothers)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Wow!	This is the fourth book in the Bay series and I loved it....It was my favorite series by Roberts and I was happy to see that she decided to write about Seth.  I do agree a little with someone who had written a review that they just couldn't picture Seth being older.  I did have somewhat of a hard time with the fact that Seth was all grown up but then again it was great to know about his life and to see what he had done with it so far....It was also great to see how all the other Quinn brother and their wives ended up....It was an overall great book that I really enjoyed and would urge others to read the series first then Chesapeake Bay....I think you would really enjoy reading this one after you have the full background first!	2003-02-26

Although I enjoyed this book and the conclusion to the story...I still thought that Rising Tides was better....Phillip was just not a character I could get into but I really like Sybil...and all the other characters were back....Don't get me wrong....I loved all the books....and you must read this....I really loved the ending!!	2002-09-02

A mother's love to keep her son safe from a horribly abusive husband....it's not a happy read because it's about a subject that's intense and not something to cheer about.  But it's a glimpse into the reality of what some mothers and women face when confronted with abuse.<br />I really love Fran's character...So strong...but doesn't know it!  The story is about how she leaves her abusive cop husband and begins to make a new life and a new identity with her little boy...and she also begins to learn how to trust and love again....but wow...what a shocking ending!  The book was so gripping and intense...but to leave it like that??  Don't know!	2001-10-17
