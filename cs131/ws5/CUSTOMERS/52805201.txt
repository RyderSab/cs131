Dear Amazon.com Reader,<br />Information systems often fail because the IT analysts, architects and builders don't know how to talk to the non-IT business people. On top of that, a major stumbling block in the development and delivery of effective solutions can be found in problems associated with all aspects of integration. Fortunately, a solid and well-grounded Business Rules approach can offer significant advantages in overcoming these hurdles.<br />Not many people may realize this, but Unisys was the proud inheritor of almost forty years of knowledge and experience in such key business critical areas as Business IT, OLTP, Mission Critical Systems, Decision Support (e.g. Data Warehousing, MAPPER etc.), Business Modelling (e.g. MAPPER/ESD - expert systems development and delivery - highly integrated Business Rules repository and rules engines) and most importantly major systems analysis, development, delivery, integration and management. Many of these assets were inherited from the hugely inventive Sperry Univac, other great ideas came from Burroughs.<br />But most of all, the real assets of a smart company are its people - and it shows. Tony Morgan has written a book that meets a real need - i.e. it addresses the question \\"so what's the big deal with Business Rules\\" -  and in passing, will inform, inspire and educate the reader in a way that only someone who knows what they are writing about can.<br />The central theme of the book is the application of Business Rules to the task of aligning IT with business goals, a task that is talked about by many, yet achieved by few. Tony Morgan maintains the readers attention by not only giving a clear and uncluttered description, with focused examples, of what Business Rules are all about, but also uses references to other aspects of IT and business - which I found immensely enjoyable.<br />All in all, I found this book about as enjoyable as having an interestingly pleasant discussion about Business Rules, Business and IT in general over a couple of beers in the local bar. So, I personally would recommend this book to anyone who wants a very good introduction to Business Rules and their role in \\"Aligning IT with Business Goals\\".<br />Best regards,<br />Martyn R Jonesin general over a couple of beers in the local bar.

Dear Reader,<br />Business Rules, like Data Warehousing, both have the potential to dramatically reverse the downward spiral in the credibility and coherence of many IT organizations. Both initiatives focus on giving the business what it wants; Data Warehousing from mainly a strategic decision-making perspective and Business Rules from mainly an operational-support and tactical-orientation perspective.<br />To understand the importance of the role of Business Rules in business is to recognize a done deal, to actively go about leveraging Business Rules as the key component in process development, application development and application evolution is really the thing that will separate the smart people from the sceptics.<br />One of the problems of Business Rules, like Data Warehousing as well, is that they are both seemingly intuitive - the sort of thing that one could do just by imagining oneself what needs to be done. Now, don't let me put you off, and I would say that there is an element of truth in the idea that, at a certain level of abstraction, both the Data Warehousing and Business Rules concepts are very straightforward. However, and this is the crux of the matter, there are a number of seemingly small and insignificant project decisions to be made where the right decisions (based on experience) are not always the most obvious or intuitive choices, especially when we base our decisions on knowledge of other IT project methods, and,  which in turn could lead to decisions that result in the collapse of your BR or DW project and the failure of yet another IT project.<br />So, if you think that Business Rules might be just the thing for your business then read this book. In it you will find a wealth of knowledge and experience. It leads the reader from a good description of real reasons for using the Business Rules approach, Business Rules concepts, through to the process of identifying, defining and capturing Business Rules, and describes, in great detail, an iterative project approach to the active and evolutionary management of Business Rules in business. The book is well structured, is easy to read - for such a detailed book - and, focuses on important issues, options and decisions involved in Business Rules.<br />As a long term advocate of the Business Rules approach I could not rate this book more highly.<br />Best regards,<br />Martyn R Jones<br />Iniciativa Org, SLiterative project approach to the active and evolutionary management of Business Rules in business.

This book is an amazing account of the history of risk and it's role in society from the distant past, through the ages and right up to the present day. It gives a charming and fascinating insight into the world of risk taking and risk management, told with all the ease of a great communicator whose subject fits them like a kid glove. I read this book alongside a heavier tome on Risk Management - Mr Philippe Jorion's excellent \\"Value at Risk: The New Benchmark for Managing Financial Risk\\" that is - and I am thankful that I did, because not only did it act as a much welcomed counter-balance to some hefty risk theory but it also introduced me, in a light and accessible manner, to some of the concepts that I had been struggling with  - an experience much like as if one could access a trusted source of profound knowledge on a subject, in my case Risk Management, without feeling that your brain has been given the once over with a common kitchen liquidizer.<br />An excellent, informative and interesting read. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a thorough, intelligent and readable introduction to risk.<br />However, one word of caution, this book has not been written to spoon-feed the less than enquiring mind, and to get the best out of it one really has to be a little more proactive and participatory. In some places it's like as if there are little puzzles left for the reader to think-out for themselves - which I find really quite engaging, a rare treat, the nearest thing to interaction one could get with the author via their written word.<br />Best regards,<br />martyn_jones@iniciativa.org	2002-07-24

The advice here is clear, comprehensive and concise.<br />Moreover, I would especially recommend this excellent tome to seasoned consultants who might believe that they know it all - it no longer amazes me to find some senior consultants who either never had the first idea about some of the basic essentials or who who have become complacent and lazy over the years.<br />Finally, I would recommend this book to anyone in business who uses management consultants in a serious way - other than to massage ones ego - this book should give you an indication of at least the levels of rigor and professionalism to expect for your money.<br />So a great insightful, knowledgeable and clear overview for the novice, an excellent set of key reminders for the seasoned professional and a useful, concise and simple benchmark for the clients of management consultants.<br />Ethan M Rasiel has come up with the goods and never keeps his eye off the great McKinsey tenets of MECE, MECE and MECE again!<br />regards,<br />martyn_jones@iniciativas.com	2001-02-12

Have you ever pondered the question, What is a decent society? Does the thought keep you awake at night, wondering, is the society in which I live decent?, and if not, do we sincerely ask oursleves, for example, am I decent anyway? and if not, and so on, do I need to do anything to change that situation?<br />In this book, Avishai Margalit explains how he constructed his moral philosophy based on the following: a decent society or civilized society is one in which the institutions of that society do not humiliate people who are subject to their authority, and in which no citizen humilates another citizen or themselves. Avishai Margalit goes on to argue that what is more important is not a &quot;just society&quot; but a &quot;decent society&quot;, based on the equilibrium between liberty and equality, a society where cruelty and humiliation has been completely erradicated.<br />This books influence should reach far beyond the confined bounds of formal philosphical debate and should be championed - or at least taken very seriously - by all decent and prospective politicians everywhere. Not since Rousseau himself has anyone approached the subject with such intelligence and passion as has Avishai Margalit. Reading this book, was for me, like living a really extraordinary experience, as I sure it will be for you.<br />regards,<br />martyn_jones@iniciativas.com	2001-02-12

When God called last orders on Dylan Thomas he wasn't joking, and probably did us out of some more of the great insight into the mystical, marvellous and mundane world of life and living and death.<br />Dylan is welsher than welsh and more universal than universal studios.

However, and thanks to a strong following in the USA, Dylan Thomas hasn't been consigned to the literary dustbin for fringe colonial artists but elevated to greatness through a force far greater than some Fleet street snobbery.<br />Dylan Thomas has been the greatest poet in the english language in the 20th century, and here is the evidence, the proof, the collateral.<br />God love em too!<br />regards,<br />martyn_jones@iniciativas.com	2001-02-11

Dayan's clarity of vision, his professionalism, his magnetism and quality of leadership have been brought to bear in creating a vivid account of a crucial period of Middle East history.<br />The book recounts the history and anecdotes of the re-creation of the state of Israel from its new roots in 1915 through to the war of idependence 1948-1952, in which Dayan played a key role. Other sections cover his role as Chief of Staff(1953-1957), his particpation as government minister and then his return to private life (1958-1967), The Six Day War (1967), the reconstruction and bridge building efforts (1967-1973), The Yom Kippur War (1973) and finally the aftermath (1973-1975).<br />Moshe Dayan was a great general who served his country with honor, dignity and courage in the hours of their most dire need. As a soldier he was brilliant and as a caring human being he was exceptional.

In this way, this book is both a gentle introduction and a great mental workout, if nothing else, and it can be much more.<br />Starting with this book by Chomsky if you haven't read any of his stuff before is like deciding on a diet and workout plan that is neither drastic or radical, but eases the reader into the Chomsky ways of seeing things, of gathering facts, of interpreting language and of developing ideas and analysis. Chomsky is nearly always delivering arguments that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, which leads for well focussed and sometimes overly-knowledge rich text, but it's well worth the effort - in my book Chomsky is one of the greatest thinkers of the last 100 years - even if you, like me, will disagree with at least 50 percent of Chomsky's conclusions.<br />Regards,<br />Martyn_jones@iniciativas.com	2001-02-05

This book names the names, shows the accusations and clearly and intelligently tears the baseless arguments and innuendo to shreds.<br />Judging by the continued attacks on Hillary and Bill it seems like many folks have gotten a taste for the despicable, this is also brough out in the book, i.e. we will get you before, during or after. This idea together with the reported and rather scary attitude of perfectully unrespectable politicians and con artists makes for enlightening, exhilerating and sometime enraging reading.<br />If you want an insight into the last fifteen years of politics in the USA then this is for you.

Obviously something that confuses business benefit with techhnological features. It then goes on to state interesting and somewhat obvios things such as &quot;To make CRM-focused data warehousing work, IT professionals need new techniques, and new methodologies&quot;.<br />In this book, Dr. Chris Todman -- apparently one of HPs leading data warehouse consultants -- delivers the first start-to-finish methodology for defining, designing, and implementing CRM-focused data warehouses.<br />Accordiing to the experts the support of Customer Relationship Management starts with identifying critical design challenges that are unique to CRM-focused data warehousing. In the context of CRM, Todman reviews data warehouse conceptual models, logical models, and physical implementation, and focuses on the crucial implications of time in data warehouse modeling and querying. You'll discover how to estimate the ROI of CRM-focused data warehousing in advance; manage data warehouse projects more effectively; and select the right software for loading, extraction, transformation, querying, data mining, campaign management, personalization, and metadata. Finally, Todman previews the future of data warehousing, covering temporal databases, OLAP SQL extensions, active decision support, the integration of external and unstructured data, next-generation search agents, and more.<br />This is an almost complete methodology for building CRM-focused data warehouses, including elements of planning, ROI, conceptual and logical models, physical implementation, project management, and so-on.<br />It is quite recommended for database developers, architects, consultants, project managers, and decision-makers.<br />Although I have seen a lot of the ideas elsewhere - primarily in Hewlett-Packards proprietary OpenWarehouse methodology - this book weighs in with a substantially lower price tag.<br />Regards,<br />martyn_jones@iniciativas.comr />Although I have seen a lot of the ideas elsewhere - primarily in Hewlett-Packards proprietary OpenWarehouse methodology - this book weighs in with a substantially lower price tag. <br />Regards,<br />martyn_jones@iniciativas.com	2001-02-04

This highly readable account of the history of the Mossad, also draws attention to the slightly less simplistic relationship between cause and effect that has worked so well and occasionally so badly for the Mossad, it highlights mischevious and damaging political influencing, it makes public revealing conversations with movers and shakers in the world of intelligence, and it does just what the title says - tell us quite a few things about The Secret History of the Mossad. Gordon Thomas is another writer who writes because he has something to say, and it shows.<br />Regards,<br />martyn_jones@iniciativas.com	2001-02-02

Johm Le Carre writes, as always, because he has something to say and his way of communicating is through the novel.<br />In the Constant Gardener we are exposed to a world of powerful human instincts, believably good, complicated and banal characters. Le Carre captures the essence of corporate and personal egoism, ambition and greed, he shows personal foibles in the most human of ways.<br />The Constant Gardener is a constant delight, it has obviously been well researched, even in the areas where most novelists seem to fall flat e.g. Business, Diplomacy and Technology, to say nothing of his brilliant yet understated characterization of those involved in the murky underworld of national security, spies and spooks.<br />In a nutshell, another riveting English language classic from the master storyteller of our times.<br />Regards,<br />martyn_jones@iniciativas.com	2001-01-31

The photographs, all black and white, convey not only the optimism inspired by the Clinton administration but also the splendid spirit of the times, even in the face of adversity, confrontation and seemingly unsurmountable challenges. As President of the USA he inspired a level of self-belief, confidence and humanity in the USA and elsewhere that has never been experienced before - and thanks to the art, insight and diligence of Robert McNeely, all this is accurately depicted in this splendid record of those wonderful years.	2001-01-30

This is a very well written and beautifully illustrated book (photographs that is), it isn't an in depth analysis of the history and events that have occurred in and around the White House, but it does give an insight into the real functions of the White House at the end of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st Century.<br />I bought the book on impulse, and was not dissapointed when I received it. Life can't all be doom, gloom and deadly dull Supreme court decisions - and this book is much more than one ray of light, to brighten even the most overly dull day.<br />Regards,<br />martyn_jones@iniciativas.com	2000-12-15

In this  area - dimensional modeling and sophisticated use of SQL - the author is  probably the best around at this moment in time.<br />So yes, buy this book if  you need a rapid learning aide for dimensional modelling and if you want to  know more about the general area of Data Warehousing and some of is best  principles and practices then also go for a couple of books by Bill Inmon -  the father of data warehousing.<br />Best regards,<br />Martyn R Jones iniciativa	1999-11-26
