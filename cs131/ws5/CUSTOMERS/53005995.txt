I puzzled over the dustjacket cover before I read it, and now I think it is grand.  <br /> <br />The book was menacing and funny at the same time. It was a deer fly buzzing round my head that I kept swatting at and missing and still it would not let me be, teasing me with menace, whispering cunning little aside jokes that make me laugh in spite of myself.  <br /> <br />The last chapter brought it all together for me, but this is not one I would recommend to my wife. She wants to know exactly what happened, and she would not think the plot moved quickly enough nor that the ending was clear enough.  <br /> <br />And for you? Heck, I can't tell. As I say, the writing is excellent and the bookstore setting may appeal to you. Humor and metaphor glow softly in this foggy darkness like fireflies.  The author worked for a while at Borders and he takes some stabs at Book Business Bureaucracy, but that isn't exactly what the book is about. And it is so ambiguous that, if you choose to read it, you will simply have to decide for yourself. <br /> <br />I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br />I'm now sending for his THE DARKEST PART OF THE WOODS which is extensively blurbed on the back of the dustjacket of THE OVERNIGHT.	2005-10-09
US	53005995	R34YZ0GJKES350	0910055998	525326501	Walking It Off: A Veteran's Chronicle of War And Wilderness	Books	5	33	37	N	Y	An Epitaph for Edward Abbey	Doug Peacock was friends with Ed Abbey, and Abbey made him a character, as George Washington Hayduke, in his books, THE MONKEY WRENCH GANG and HAYDUKE LIVES! <br /> <br />Doug Peacock was with Edward Abbey when he died. <br /> <br />This worthy book is about the author coming to terms with his friendship with Ed Abbey, the death of Ed Abbey, and there is a chronicle of their adventures and philosophy. Peacock distances himself from the one-dimensional Hayduke, and says that while the celebrity of it opened some doors for him, it was also an embarrassment. Peacock says that Abbey was the real Hayduke. <br /> <br />Be that as it may, Doug Peacock is the real Doug Peacock, and in some 200 pages of easy-to-read words of prose he tells a human story worth telling.  At turns, this memoir is profound, remorseful, insightful, wistful, and poetic. <br /> <br />For example, toward the end of this book, there is this, from Ed Abbey's journal: <br /> <br />\\"...my life seems to me a dismal failure. Good Christ! 58 years old and I've never learned to do anything practical, useful, sociable. I am becoming a cranky bitter embittered dyspeptic old fart,,,I feel so goddamn inadequate, weak, helpless, inepts, slobbish.\\" <br /> <br />\\"GLOOM...and DOOM. Consumed in self-loathing. Bitterness. Disgust with the world of literature, politics, art. Makes a fella want to walk away over the horizon, find a comfortable canyon, lie down, curl up, fade out...\\" <br /> <br />My thought is, the way this resonates with me is, that Ed Tom Bell, Cormac McCarthy's protagonist in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, is also 58 and just seems older somehow, the way Ed Abbey here seems older. It means nothing, of course, except for the way it resonates personally to me. <br /> <br />Peacock continues down Growler Valley, dreams of a jaguar, sees signs of fox and a coyote den dug into a thick of wolfberry: <br /> <br />\\"By afternoon, a number of ancient paths converge toward Charlie Bell. . .I see white animals againstthe black of the Growlers. I take out Clarke Abbey's binoculars and squat behind a leafed-out ocotillo plant. The long-legged animals look like some exotic species of domestic goat except that they are pronghorn antelope.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Ten antelopes, six of which are males, browse fresh green ocotillo leaves...The pronghorn haven't seen me yet. I'm hoping I can drop down a gully to Charlie Bell without disturbing them. I have to get water before dark.\\" <br /> <br />\\"At my first move, the antelope look up at me. Sh-t. They begin to mill and move east, finally breaking and running among the rugged hillside boulders as gracefully and smoothly as the red-tailed hawk soaring above. . .\\" <br /> <br />\\"Out of ancient habit, I approach the well cautiously. I listen to the birds and crickets. No one else around. Charlie Bell Well pumps water into a tank and then into a cement trough.\\" <br /> <br />\\"A wave of deja vu sweeps over me. I am haunted by landscapes, the recoccuring images of places that drift through my dreams and startle my daydreaming. One of those is right here, the sacred desert. Sometimes magical wild animals live in the dream and spill over into the physical landscape like jaguars and cougars. I look around: I know the lion is watching me.\\" <br /> <br />Peacock says that Abby wanted to be reincarnated as a desert bird, a buzzard. And on the last page, he comes to Ed Abbey's grave: <br /> <br />\\"I stare at the boulder. The boulder stares back. Chiseled into the rock: Edward Paul Abbey 1927-1989 'No Comment.' <br /> <br />I submit that Edward Abbey would approve of the comments made about him by Doug Peacock in this book, a fitting epitaph for the man if there ever was one.	2005-10-06

This excellent author, who has deservedly won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, has nothing to prove. He is a writer's writer and this book reads like it is from the heart. He deconstructs his unpublished novel, written after his return from Viet Nam, as he desconstructs his life during that time. It is a tale, a tale of a tale, and a warning that all war books exist in a shaky reality. <br /> <br />It is not a heroic tale, except that the author's intelligence and honesty is heroic in the face of temptations to make all military service heroic. <br /> <br />I doubt that it will be among the author's most popular books, but it will probably remain my favorite. It is not overtly pro-war nor anti-war, but strives toward a realism (which never ceases to shake) and a dark sense of humor, pointing out that the domino theory was a stupid concept to die for, and that the war was fought stupidly by a self-serving bureaucracy, by men who were simply men following the logic of their time. <br /> <br />Kidder puts some of the literary personalities he knew at the time in here, Robert Fitzgerald (who translated THE ODYSSEY) and Sam Toperoff (whose own memoirs are also little known gems). In Viet Nam, Kidder was reading Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS and LORD JIM, and other books he quotes from or at least mentions include THE GREAT GATSBY and A FAREWELL TO ARMS. It is understated, but you can tell that he admired Hemingway in the typical macho way back then, but when he looks back at himself now, he sees how foolish he was. Kidder may have written this as a kind of catharsis. <br /> <br />It is honest and wise, and we need all the honesty and wisdom we can get.	2005-10-02

Not so. <br /> <br />I agree with Cormac McCarthy's vision that total harmony (as in war between nations) does not exist and likely will never exist for long, unless science somehow turns the aggressive markers to the off position in every human DNA around. And I don't think that would be a good idea. <br /> <br />That war will always be with us does not mean that as individuals we should not be against a particular war. That the potential for war exists in us does not mean that any particular war might not be postponed, belayed, or settled through diplomacy. That mankind in general is endlessly stupid and violent does not mean that individuals cannot achieve our own awareness and peace on a smaller scale. <br /> <br />Frederic Wakeman's SHORE LEAVE was first published in 1944 before the war was over, and it contains many insights on war that ring true to such books as Anthony Lloyd's MY WAR GONE BY, I MISS IT SO, Chris Hedges' WAR IS A FORCE THAT GIVES US MEANING, and Norman Solomon's WAR MADE EASY. <br /> <br />SHORE LEAVE is part novel and part memoir, and although it was a best seller due to the sexy cover it wore in some editions, due to its witty one-liners, and due to the freewheeling sex and adultery in the plot. It contains an occasional reference to racial and gender stereotypes, and hence is not entirely politically correct reading today.  But as a study of wartime, it is very insightful.  And still very funny. <br /> <br />The darker and more darkly humorous guts of the novel were torn out and it was made into a successful Broadway play retitled \\"Kiss Them For Me\\" which starred Richard Widmark, Audrey Meadows, and Judy Holliday. Later it was made into a lame movie by that name starring Cary Grant and Jayne Mansfield. <br /> <br />One of the things the novel in its original form points out is that war is welcomed most by simple minds. It simplifies things. It relieves men of the responsibility of critical thinking. The military life in war gives men the illusion of freedom while enslaving them. <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended as a study of wartime. Wakeman wrote a number of other books later, but his first was his best. His son, Frederic Wakeman, jr., became an expert on China and most of the books in print under the name (including the scholarly POLICING SHANGHAI 1927-1937) were written by the younger man. <br /> <br />I'd like to see SHORE LEAVE reissued in a new edition, please.  What I'd really like to see is a deluxe annotated hardcover edition, with end notes explaining the nuances of real history behind the text. <br /> <br />Publishers, are you listening?	2005-07-16

A couple of typical items from the hundreds that appear here:    Morris, Edmund, \\"The Art of Biography,\\" in Biography and Books, edited by John Y. Cole. Washington,D.C., Library of Congress, 1986.     Citing Boswell and other biographers, Morris argues eloquently that \\"reality cannot be truthfully represented without honest distortion,\\" even as the Greeks created a Parthenon \\"slightly out of synch\\" because it would look \\"straighter that way.\\"     Morris also suggests that biography can learn to unify its presentation of lives through the study of motifs in music and themes in the novel. Yet he urges biographers to eschew Freud: \\"The ideal biographer should be godlike in the Flaubertian sense--apparent everywhere, visible nowhere.\\" Or like the photographer who steps back out of the picture after arranging it.     ____     Holmes, Richard, Coleridge: Early Visions. New York, Viking Press, 1990.     In his \\"traditional narrative,\\" Holmes has tried to experiment: to set Coleridge \\"talking,\\" rendering as many episodes as possible through his subject's \\"flights of phrase and metaphor.\\" He also has provided footnotes, not to document or expand on the text but to \\"initiate another level of speculation, a third perspective--besides those of Coleridge and his narrator.\\" This \\"down stage voice\\" represents a sort of \\"gloss\\" on the narrative, which in itself reflects the dominion of the subject over his biographer.\\"     ----    This is an outstanding and entertaining work of scholarship.

This is an entertaining and informative book about the difficulties authors face when attempting a biography.  The battles are chronicled between biographer and subject, and sometimes between biographer and book, and then between biographer and reviewer.    Conflicts?  What is irrelevant and what is fair game?  When sources conflict, which is to be believed?  Does it matter whether the subject agrees or approves of what you print?  What ethics apply?    Detailing his own experiences with subjects like Lillian Hellmann, Norman Mailer, Martha Gellhorn, and the late Susan Sontag, the author shows how the decisions are made, and the reasoning behind those decisions.    This is a handsome hardcover with easy-to-read print.  There is a complete index, and his sources are given.  Some of the books he discusses I now must find and buy, and the amplifying end notes are helpful in this regard.  A five-star-book, and a pleasure to read and own.	2005-06-15

I read this in tandem with Nicholas Sparks's TRUE BELIEVER, as both are about investigative reporters, professional debunkers, who encounter what seems to be the real thing at last.  Those who have read and enjoyed Sparks's bestseller need to pick up this one for an alternate view.  <br /> <br />Connie Willis has penned a spoof of mountebanks in her own style, a funny, endearing take on the men and women who pretend to reach out to the \\"other side,\\" whose shams and talk show promotions and \\"reality TV segments\\" adorn our culture yet today.  Her protagonist debunks fake after fake, but is taken aback but a psychic who actually seems to be channeling the legendary debunker H. L. Mencken himself, against her will.    <br /> <br />This book is short, a special edition of her novella, but those who value Willis and those who value Mencken will all want to own it, and I predict that it will be one of the more highly sought after collectors items.  FIRST EDITIONS MAGAZINE recently did a story on the values of Connie Willis's backlist, and if you have not yet seen it, you're missing something. <br /> <br />The dustjacket on INSIDE JOB is dropdead gorgeous.

This is a contemporary literary western, as its title implies, but it is also a love story, a meditation on animal rights, and a study of the values of a small community.  The author has a gift of dialog and writes beautiful descriptive passages. <br /> <br />It's interesting to compare the history and sense of identity of Pattiann, one of the author's main characters in here, with that of Judy Blunt, author of the memoir, BREAKING CLEAN.  Blunt's memoir is an excellent tandem read, and in the front of the book she provides us with a map which comes in handy reading either book. <br /> <br />Blunt is also the first person the author thanks on the acknowledgments page, but I can also see the influences here of William Kittredge's HOLE IN THE SKY and OWNING IT ALL, and perhaps some of Pam Houston's COWBOYS ARE MY WEAKNESS.  Also, there are some interesting contrasts in here to Alan LeMay's novel by the same title, WINTER RANGE, published back in 1932. <br /> <br />Claire Davis's WINTER RANGE, however, is still distinctly the author's creation and wondrously beautiful and compelling it is.  Overlooked for major awards during its year, it was still good enough to be selected for discussion by the FRESH INK READING GROUP at Readerville and made for an interesting month.

First, let me say how much I enjoyed this book.  It is a work of tremendous research informed by a mature mind which deeply understands the roles of history and story in creating self-identity.    I was alerted to its existence by Ilene Shepard Smiddy, author of DAUGHTER OF SHILOH, also a splendid narrative/adventure retelling a part of the Shoeboots story, but centering on Clarinda Allington and her children.    Dr. Miles provides us with a helpful family tree in the front of the book, and inside there are maps that help orient the story.  The historical asides and reflections using Toni Morrison's BELOVED are treasures.  Inside too are several illustrations and pictures, including one of a Shoeboots descendant.  The text is divided into logical chapters.  The notes are easy to follow and delicious to read, and they are followed by a full bibliography and a comprehensive index.    I would like to see the notes expanded to include the family of Napoleon Bonaparte, perhaps a grandson of Shoeboots, or of one of the Shoeboots, and who entered the mainstream population in Kentucky as a free black.    As Dr. Miles points out, there was more than one individual who was referred to as the Boot or Shoeboots (and other nicknames, in both English and Cherokee), and I suspect that this was a concept name involving the crow or the rooster--the hero of a Cherokee parable.  It is fascinating to read about here, and her arguments are engaging.  Highly recommended reading!	2005-03-29

I finished this book while listening to her multiple CD collections.  The book gets five stars for its scholarship, its extensive notes, its all inclusive index.    But still it seems too cold for the subject at hand, or perhaps I'm just disappointed that Dinah Washington was more shallow than I imagined her to be.  Probably the latter.    Also Cohodas's appraisal of the albums I enjoyed most is just the opposite of what I feel myself.  What I hear as honest and tragic, the biography calls tired and too husky.  And the other way around.    I had no idea that Dinah Washington did \\"It's Too Soon To Know\\" before Etta James (who owns the song in my estimation).  Etta James came later, and she idolized Dinah Washington and made her sound her own, strings and all.    When Etta James spotted Dinah Washington in the audience at the nightclub where she was singing, she abandoned her original program and sang \\"Unforgettable\\" as a tribute to her idol.  The song was broken up by Dinah Washington screaming at her, pointing a finger at her saying, \\"Girl, don't you ever try to do the Queen's songs.\\"    According to Cohodas, Dinah Washington's lovers, to whom she dedicated songs, were usually gone by the time the records were released.  She was married seven times and had many lovers in-between.  Such as the \\"Rafael\\" she mentions on her cover of Irving Berlin's \\"I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm.\\"    Dinah was dead at thirty-nine, but her music lives on and always will for this listener.  This biography reminds me again that Art is part the author and part the reader, part the singer and part the listener.  What I hear in her music has not changed.	2004-11-18

Beautiful cover picture on this, nice sized text, elaborate notes, full bibliography and index.  All in all, a great read, thoroughly researched.<br />One place that the author should have researched is in the court records in the Archives in Frankfort.  Sehlinger mentions Preston's participation in protecting minorities during the Bloody Monday riots, but he makes no mention of Preston's being cornered by a mob, of him pulling a gun and looking around as if wondering which thug to shoot first and saying, &quot;Have I no friends here?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes, you have,&quot; said a voice from behind him, and Joshua Speed, Abraham Lincoln's great friend, came forward with a pistol.  Together they faced down the mob, but Preston was afterwards arrested and tried for having an illegal firearm at the polls.  The account of this trial, too, is interesting.<br />Also there were other court cases and duels, fights, etc., which Preston participated in which are not mentioned in the biography.  His testimony, and his everyday record as a lawyer, can be had by going through these Circuit and Criminal court cases, and would have made an interesting facet of the man's biography.<br />But the author uncovered much that I have not seen in print elsewhere, and he has organized and written it up here in a professional way.

Here's Malone's marvelous opening lines: <br /> <br />\\"Two things don't happen very often in Hillston, North Carolina. We don't get much snow, and we hardly ever murder one another.  <br /> <br />Suicide is more our style; we're a polite college town, and our lives are sheltered by old trees. Maybe once a year a blizzard slips around a corner of the Smokey Mountains and blusters its way east, or a gale swells up from Cape Hatteras and runs across the Piedmont to break up our agreeable liason with nature; but usually storms lose interest along the way.  <br /> <br />Whenever one does barge through town, merchants stockpile sleds as recklessly as Carolina blockade-runners once stowed tobacco and cotton. Schools close. Cars spin off the roads. People have accidents.  <br /> <br />The commit murders too, but much more often in thought than in deed. There is some impertinence in being a homicide detective in a town that wants to go on believing it is too small and too temperate to require such expertise.\\"  <br /> <br />Of course, it is snowing, and there has been a murder.	2004-02-27

Chandler's opening style is widely imitated. Here's a conscious tribute which goes Chandler one better by putting this voice into Hitler's Germany.  Here he parodies the opening of THE BIG SLEEP, and does it deliciously.  Only Barry Fantoni does Chandler as well.      \\"Circling the courtyard was an ambulatory, with a roof supported by thick beams and wooden columns, and this was patrolled by man with a pair of evil-looking Dobermanns. There wasn't much light apart from the coachlamp by the fron door, but as far as I could see the house was white with pebbledash walls and a deep mansard roof--as big as a decent-sized hotel of the sort I couldn't afford. Somewhere in the trees behind the house a peacock was screaming for help.\\"     This paragraph is also brilliantly constructed, but what especially appeals to me is the self-effacing joke about the size of the house and the last sentence, the sort of telling detail that mirrors the sardonic attitude of the narrator toward the Nazi rich.     Next paragraph:     \\"Closer to the door I got my first good look at the doctor. Since he was at least fifty, I suppose you could say he was distinguished looking. Taller than he had seemed sitting in the back of the car, and dressed fastidiously, but with a total disregard for fashion. He wore a stiff color you could have sliced bread with, a pin-striped suit of a light-grey shade, a cream-colored waist-coat and spats; his hands were gloved in grey kid, and on his neatly cropped square grey head he wore a large grey hat with a brim that surrounded the high pleated crown like a castle moat. He looked like an old suit of armor.\\"     A typical Chandleresque paragraph with the short summation sentence at the end like a punchline.     Next paragraph:     \\"He ushered me towards the big mahogany door which swung open to reveal an ashen-faced butler who stood aside as we crossed the threshold and stepped into the wide entrance hall. It was the kind of hall that made you feel lucky just to have got through the door. Twin flights of stairs with gleaming white banisters led up to the upper floors, and on the ceiling hung a chandeleir that was bigger than a church-bell and gaudier than a stripper's ear-rings. I made a mental note to raise my fees.\\"     Another Chandleresque paragraph with the trade mark existenialism in the last sentence. He's not political, let alone communist, but the contrast between rich and poor is never far from the narrator's mind.

Ted Franklin Belue is that rare mix, both scholar and wordsmith, with an artist's eye for the beauty of America and the legacy of the past.<br />In the preface, he acknowledges Win Blevins's narrative, GIVE YOUR HEART TO THE HAWKS, as a model for his own narrative of the eastern woodsmen.  It belongs beside that one but, in this researchers opinion, this book surpasses it.<br />The text is equally involving, compelling, inspiring.  But Belue has packed his own book with much more, including the marvelous illustrations of frontiersmen and Shawnees, well drawn maps and charts, mini-biographies of interesting characters.<br />Also, Belue supplies notes and appendages which will prove invaluable to the legion of historians and genealogists doing their own research into the frontier era, looking for more.<br />This book has already been praised to the heavens by such renown authors as Dr. Thomas Clark and Allan Eckert, but you don't have to be well read in frontier lore to appreciate it.  In fact, this book will likely inspire others to great works, just as Blevins's GIVE YOUR HEART TO THE HAWKS inspired Belue to eventually write the landmark work you see before you.	2003-11-12

Here's a choice excerpt satirizing the corporate thinking that dominates the publishing industry today (edited to remove one rather lame but possibly objectionable four-letter word):<br /><br />&quot;There is an implicit code that customers rely on. If a book cover has raised lettering, metallic lettering, or raised metallic lettering, then it is telling the reader: Hello, I am an easy-to-read work on espionage, romance, a celebrity, and/or murder. To readers who do not care for such things, this lettering tells them: Hello. I am garbage. Such books can use only glossy paper for the jacket; Serious Books can use glossy finish as well, but it is only Serious Books that are allowed to use matte finish.' <br /><br />&quot;Diminutively sized paperbacks, like serial romances or westerns or dieting and astrology guides, are aimed at the uneducated. But diminutively sized hardcover books are aimed at the educated -- excepting those that are very diminutive, which are relgious books aimed at the uneducated -- and unless they are in a highly rectangular format, in which they are point-of-purchse books aimed at the somewhat-but-not-entirely educated. However, vertically rectangular diminutive softcover books, which tend to be pocket travel guides, are aimed at the educated. But horizontally rectangular diminutive softcover books -- a genre pioneered by Garfield Gains Weight -- are not.' <br /><br />&quot;Then there are the colors. Bright colors, and shiny colors, are necessary for the aforementioned books with raised lettering. Black will work too, but only if used to set off the bright and shiny colors. Because, remember, with the customary base in mind, the book will need to be a bright and shiny object. Conversely, a work of Serious Literature will have muted, tea-stained colors. Black is okay here too, but only if used to accentuate cool blues and grays and greens.' <br /><br />&quot;Woe and alas to any who transgress these laws. A number of reviewers railed against The Bridges of Madison Country, becuase it used the diminutive hardcover size and muted color scheme of, say, an Annie Dillard book -- thus cruelly tricking readers of Serious Literature into buying junk. Not to be outdone, the Harvard University Press issued Walter Benjamin's opus The Arcades Project with gigantic raised metallic lettering. One can only imagine the disgust of blowhard fifthysomethings in bomber jackets as they slowly realized that the Project they were reading about was a cultural analysis of the 19th century Parisian life -- and not, say a tale involving renegade Russian scientists and a mad general aboard a nuclear submarine.' <br /><br />&quot;Finally, on Serious Books and junk alike there will be a head-shot photo of The Author sitting still while looking pensive or smiling faintly into the indeterminate distance -- the one pose that has no existence in the author's actual daily life. The size of this photo will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the book. If this photo is rendered in color, it is not a Serious Book. If there is no author photo at all, then it is a Serious Book indeed -- perhaps even a textbook. If a color photo of the author occupies the entire front cover, the book is unequivocable junk.&quot;	2003-09-08

A favorite quote from the book:<br />\\"Reading begins with the body, with settling in. Up, in the crook of a tree, or down, on the green grass below. On the floor beneath the ceiling fan, on the shore beside the receding sea, over a plate of clam linguini, in the bathtub, late at night. Reading begins with settling in, with the posture of surrender.<br />Even the youngest children understand the high art of surrender. They cede to a bedtime story just as they finally cede to sleep, floating on the raft of words they hear their parents read.<br />When we surrender to books we are made new. We are reinvented, we are fortified, we are blessed. New perspective seep into our politics and talk. Fresh sympathies arise. Raw memories are roused awake. Urgencies begin to clamor. Even our bodies change when we submit to books, when we allow ourselves to live them. Our hearts beat that much quicker or that much slower, our muscles lengthen our or tense, our stomachs turn, and just as suddenly, our stomachs grow pacified. Reading clams the anxious, heals the heartsick, distracts the oppressed, sustains the lonely. Reading is like singing. We can hardly live without it.<br />In this confused, tormented, dangerous, exotic and terrifyingly beautiful world, books exist for many reasons: to defend, to protect, to complain, to berate, to rule, to prove, to instruct, to insist. Books can be manifestos and they can be screeds. They can oppose and impose, they can boast and promote, they can offend. But so many books, so much of the time, are created most simply and also most thrillingly because writers dare to dream and because readers dare to let thme. Because history can be entered into and because fantasy can enthrall and because the personal can be made to speak for every one of us.\\"	2003-08-07

I can't predict if anyone else will feel the same way I did about this novel.  I certainly liked it, and will read a dozen or so other books before tackling another one by the same author, just to let things sink in some more.<br />I was drawn to the book by this quote of the author, from a LOCUST interview.  Stewart here speaks of magic, but to me it is the magic of fiction to enchant, the magic of insight to enlighten, the ah ha! experience.  If you like this quote, you may enjoy this book as much as I did:<br />&quot;There are several different kinds of truth in the world: truths of one, truths of two, and truths of three or more.'<br />&quot;Truths of three or more are what science is concerned about. They're external, and they're about the manipulation of the world that is shared by everyone.'<br />&quot;Truths of two would be things like the love you have for someone else - very difficult to measure or quantify, but clear to that individual.'<br />&quot;Truths of one are those things that seem intensely true and meaningful to you but are impossible to communicate, to measure and give to someone else in quite the same way you can give someone else a wave length or a hundred kilos of mass, or whatever.' <br />&quot;And when you get magic like you have in a role-playing game, that is profoundly concerned with using theoretically magical things to manipulate the external world - like, 'With this spell, you can generate a fireball that will do this much damage to a physical structure' - that's like a truth of three or more. It seems to me, magic in its most important sense is about those truths of two and one. It has to have some transformative, powerful relationship to the people doing it. Science does not. The whole point about science or technology is that once it's engineered out, it doesn't matter if you turn on the light switch or I turn on the light switch. Magic shouldn't be like that. It isn't reproducible, isn't the same for everyone. It's intensely personal, and speaks to those more personal and subjective truths.&quot;	2003-08-02

And McCarthy is definitely a blue collar writer.  Legends abound about him disdaining commercialism and refusing money when he had none (just to make a speaking appearance, according to an ex-wife).<br />McCarthy's distain for the trough, coupled with the non-commercial appeal and enduring quality of his writing, serve to endear him all the more to all modest but honest farmers and horseman and other such self-reliant folk.

This choice quote is from the preface:	In one of my very favorite prefaces, the protagonist (author) says that he is writing the preface before he writes the text, rather than writing the preface last as is commonly done: <br />&quot;. . .we are all familar with the after-the-fact tone--weary, self-justificatory, agrieved, apologetic--shared by ship captains appearing before boards of inquiry to explain how they come to run their vessels aground, and by authors composing forewards.&quot; <br />It is &quot;a collection of memories, dreams, reflections, the whole simmering together, synergistically exchanging savors and essences like some ideal daube. This will, I hope, give the book a serendipitous, ambulatory, and yet progressive structure.&quot; <br />&quot;Finally, I have decided that, wherever possible, the primary vehicle for the transmission of my culinary reflections will be the menu. These menus shall be arranged seasonally. It seems to me that the menu lies close to the heart of the human impulse to order, to beauty, to pattern. It draws on the original chthonic upwelling that underlies all art.&quot; <br />&quot;A menu can embody the anthropology of a culture or the psychology of an individual; it can be a biography, a cultural history, a lexicon. . .&quot; <br />&quot;It can be a way of knowledge, a path, an inspiration, a Tao, an ordering, a memory, a fantasy, a seduction, a prayer, a summoning, an incantation murmured under the breath as the torchlights sink lower and the forest looms taller and the wolves howl louder and the fire prepares for its submission to the encroaching dark.&quot; <br />&quot;I'm not sure that this would be my choice for a honeymoon hotel.

This is one of those little known gems of history, told by a man with intricate knowledge of the primary sources, but what makes this extraordinary is his use of local court records and tidbits of manuscript journals and private collections, Heck Papers, Prickett Papers, Ice Papers, Morgan Papers, Shinn Papers, John Owens' journal, and many others.<br />Mysteries, such as appear in Indian trader James Kenny's Ft. Pitt journal, are ferreted out, clue by clue, put together with local records, possibilities argued, and the evidence laid out for all to see.  Rare info on Indian traders John Owens and Baltzer Shilling, things that helped me track these families down to Kentucky and beyond.<br />One of the things he discovered is that two Quakers named Townsend and Colson traded with Tecumseh's Shawnees.  The Shawnees did not mind the &quot;wide-hats&quot; passing through their country to trade with them, as long as they dressed in Quaker clothes and did not hunt on the Indian side of the river.<br />But during the intense peace negotiations that were going on between the Ohio country Indians and the Virginians at Ft. Nelson, Townsend was caught in hunting clothes on Shawnee land, and burned to make an example of--it was this horrific burning that the youthful Tecumseh witnessed, and for which legend says that he denounced all such torture as long as he lived.<br />Lough pieces the bits and pieces of history together and examines the likeliest case.<br />Later, while researching frontiersmen in Kentucky, I opened an old Virginia court case (that was transferred to Kentucky) and found promissory notes that had gone from Indian town to Indian town during the peace negotiations in the 1780s.  Among the few witnesses signing at the Indian towns were a Colson and a Townsend, which does not prove the legend, but perhaps offers additional clues that might shore up the legend simply by proving their presence there.  Someone may yet find some more.  That's the way history works.<br />Just one example of the wealth of information in this volume.  It is sadly out of print, but you can probably obtain a copy on interlibrary loan somewhere close to where you live.	2003-07-15

It is the time of the first Gulf War. \\"Saturday morning, early. The road up ahead is quiet and dark. The headlights slice through the darkness like a sharp filet knife cutting fish. But what spills out isn't the gleaming entrails of morning but only more darkness. In the rearview mirror it closes seamlessly together again and goes on forever.\\" <br /><br />The first few sentences are a metaphor of the theme of the novel, cutting open the past and exhuming the buried crime. In the first paragraph we discover the narrator is a woman and we get the feel of the strength of her character; we learn that she is not skittish, not prone to the fear of dangers real or imagined. She is not unaware of dangers around her, such as the bears she could hear, and smell them too, \\"a smell as hard as axle grease.\\" <br /><br />The rest of the first chapter is packed with good things: beautiful language, moody asides, foreshadowing and subtle revelations of character. The narrator is a 61 year old woman who runs a roadside cafe that caters to truckers, loggers, hunters, and tourists. We like her immediately. <br /><br />There is a nice bit about the radio, loneliness, the cover of darkness. \\"I slam headlong into that darkness, hoping that if I go fast enough I'll shatter it like a piece of smoked glass. And on the other side? Maybe morning.\\" <br /><br />The glass symbol is reprised later in the chapter, when the red-faced man looks in her car window at her, startling her out of a sleep, \\"as if I'd fallen asleep during those war years and just woke up.\\" <br /><br />Sleep is a metaphor, as it is the lack of sleep, she says, \\"that finally begins to hit me--makes me feel my age like a heavy woolen coat that smells of rain.\\" <br /><br />And the red-faced man has parallel symbols in \\"the solemn red face of the alarm clock, waiting for first light.\\" Then later the oil light in her car comes on, \\"a red demon eye staring back at me.\\" Luckily, she finds a Shell service station open, and there is an interesting exchange with the young cat-eyed man who works there. Comments on war, the control of government, the lies, the play of masculinity and femininity. And this is all in the first chapter. <br /><br />The chapter ends with a reflection on Time: \\"Time seems to have lost its texture, is able to expand or contract, to take on new shapes like a cloud on a windy day.\\" <br /><br />The panther, cat, wolf, bear and other hunter allusions intrigue me. But all men aren't predators. Leon, for instance, has rabbit eyes. <br /><br />Back to that wonderfully multi-leveled and understated scene where Libby is driving in the snow and nearly runs out of oil. Her old car has a degenerative ailment, like cancer. She finds the yellow Shell station (not a Gulf station) in the fog and the young blond man comes out to help her in orange overalls. He has nocturnal eyes too, but he works \\"with the slow fussy movements of a raccoon.\\" <br /><br />He checks the oil and brings the dipstick back to show her, \\"pointing it at her the way a matador aims a sword at a bull.\\" But he doesn't want to hurt her, just to warn her and not just about the cancer in her car. He wears the orange overalls of the oil company, but detests the ongoing Gulf War where men are asked to die for oil. <br /><br />He tells her the story of his father who fought for them in the Viet Nam war and was sprayed with Agent Orange, and got cancer from it. He is angry about this, not so much about the dying as about the lies, \\"We're just looking for the bastards to tell us the truth.\\" <br /><br />This thread, the individual vs. the lies of the military-industrial complex, is mocked when Libby mentions that the souvenirs she sells tourists actually come from the Smokey Mountains. \\"What do they know?\\" And the question is reprised again when Libby discusses the newsreel propaganda pictures of goose-stepping blond giants wearing swastikas and jackboots. But it turns out that these German kids look like kids anywhere. \\"Whatdo we know?\\" <br /><br />A moody windswept cover adorns the Harper edition of the book (starkly beautiful too), and I like the easy-to-read print size.	2003-07-15

US	53005995	R3NHQQEIGLKZZL	0688158358	931901164	The Legend of Blue Jacket	Books	5	6	8	N	Y	Excellent book which may be close to the real story.	I just received this from Amazon.com, read it, and find that it is exactly what it claims to be, a marvelous story based upon the traditions handed down by whites and Shawnee descendants alike.  Shawnee Chief Charles Bluejacket believed it himself.    Many of those claiming to descend from Chief Blue Jacket do not descend from him at all, of course, because there was more than one Blue Jacket--many of them, in fact.  The DNA tests that one militant group of Shawnees descendants uses for their political claims were interesting but not definitive, because although you can document Oklahoma and Kansas Bluejacket DNA, you cannot document Chief Blue Jacket's DNA unless you somehow ascertain where the old chief was buried and dig him up.    I worked with Mrs. Norma Luallen on the Bluejacket family genealogy and we were both aware of the holes in the Shawnee genealogies, the lack of solid documentation now leaped over by some of the most vocal and militant of the Shawnees trying to shout down any other opposing viewpoint to their own.    The fact is, there were many, many whites among the Shawnees and the THE LEGEND OF BLUE JACKET serves as a common and composite story of some of their documented experiences.  No white Shawnee chiefs?  There seem to have been a great number of them including, among others, adopted Joshua Rennick (Chief Wryneck), adopted Chief Joseph Parks, adopted Chief Lewis Rogers, and according to Randolph Noe, the late Shawnee historian and bibliographer, adopted Chief Stephen Ruddle.    I'm a genealogist who has specialized in Native American genealogies for over thirty years...I've seen all of the evidence mentioned by other reviewers, and then some.  There was more than one Blue Jacket, for it was a Shawnee concept name, part of a parable involving an animal--probably a blue jay, the bird with the blue jacket--and was carried by many individuals at different times.    This is a great story for children, a well told legend, magnificently illustrated,in easy-to-read type and inspiring language.  And although it may not be literally true--no historical fiction is--there still may be more value in it than some reviewers have allowed.    Richard L. Pangburn	2003-07-13
US	53005995	R2H38MYZZUE7CH	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	1	3	N	Y	The Deeper Meanings of Shipwreck &amp; Life's Choices	I was at first put off by the hype, which made it sound like THE CELESTINE PROPHECY, and I was pleasantly surprised when I started reading it and liking it, and after reading it a second time, it soars in my estimation.<br /><br />The protagonist is handicapped by his name, as well as by a physical inferiority and a speech impediment, all of which typecast him into a pecking order he longs to escape. <br /><br />He studies pecking orders, and I enjoyed what he says about them, and then he takes charge of his own destiny, finding a way out of the pecking order, or at least, finding a way to stay off the lower rung of it. <br /><br />Then Pi looks within the circle of being to achieve a higher state of awareness than those around him. There is no God but God, as the Muslims say, and he agrees, accepts all religions, even if the leaders of such reject him, for, he reasons, if there is no God but God, then he belongs to them all and they are--or rather should be if purely practiced--all the same. <br /><br />He becomes religious in the best sense of the word, which is to say, not really a member of any one religion, but a member of them all, a believer in universal goodness, a non-secular Walt Whitman. <br /><br />I enjoyed the first part of the novel much more than the second part, although the bit with the tiger was very good too. It says something about power and pecking orders and faith (or, hope, optimism, be-of-good-cheerfulness) and the reciprocal nature of goodness. <br /><br />The reader is given a choice of endings, and I think that's the point. The stories are equally true, and the stories are equally fiction. The answer to the koan is, when given the choice between glass half-empty and glass half-full, we should choose the latter. <br /><br />Back when Pi was caught in the pecking order, he saw himself as reflected in the eyes of others. He was trapped in the identity box where others defined him. He steps out of the box by achieving a higher sense of awareness. Then when he practices religion, he refuses to let others define his religion for him. He lives by his own definition. <br /><br />Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be, as Lincoln said. Some things are beyond our control--we get cancer or involved in carwrecks or are stranded by shipwrecks--things which are the responsibility of Chance and Time--but we can achieve a better control on reality by taking control of the life of the mind and by directing ourselves in a positive way, living with a sense of goodness and personal responsibility. <br /><br />I am reminded of the movie, GROUNDHOG DAY.<br /><br />Yann Martel says that his choice of Richard Parker as the tiger's name was no coincidence. In fact, it's the result of a triple historical coincidence, two historical Richard Parker's having been involved in shipwrecks and cannibalism, and Edgar Allan Poe's novel, entitled THE ADVENTURES OF ARTHUR GORDON PYM, also features a Richard Parker and coincidentally in an ironic role.	2003-07-11

The chapters on books include: <br />William Faulkner's Ike McCaslin in GO DOWN, MOSES. <br />L. D. Clark's A BRIGHT TRAGIC THING: A TALE OF CIVIL WAR IN TEXAS, about the Great Hanging in Gainesville, Texas in 1862. <br />Gore Vidal's BILLY THE KID. <br />Jan Candia Coleman's I, PEARL HART, based upon a true story and perhaps the most interesting essay here. \\"About female self-assertion in a cruel, male dominated world.\\" <br />Montserrat Fontes's DREAMS OF THE CENTAUR. <br />David Morrell's LAST REVEILLE, another fine essay that made me think I might want to read the book after all. <br />Mariana Azuela's LOS DE ABADJO, \\"a classic about the Mexican Revolution which features a band of mavericks who drift into and along with the Revolution without any clear sense of purpose.\\" <br />Other essays are entitled: \\"The Feminizing of Freedom and Fulfillment: Como Agua Para Chocolate,\\" \\"Mirrors, Dreams, and Memory: Gringo Viejo,\\" and \\"Crossing Into Fascism in Bisbee 17.\\" <br />Doublas Canfield earned a bachelor's degree magna cum laude from the University of Notre Dame in 1963, master's degrees from Yale and the Johns Hopkins Universities in 1964 and 1966, respectively, and a Ph.D. from the University of Florida in 1969, where he was a United States Steel Foundation Fellow and where he earned election to Phi Beta Kappa. He taught at UCLA before coming to the University of Arizona in 1974, where he became Regents Professor in 1994.<br />Besides the book above, Canfield was the author of several scholarly books and articles in thetwo fields of Restoration and early eighteenth-century British literature (particularly the drama) and comparative literature and culture of the Southwest borderlands. In the spring of 2001, he was invited to Italy, to the University of Florence to lecture in this latter field and to the University of Tuscia to lecture in the former, where a series of translations of Restoration comedies into Italian has begun in his honor.<br />An expert on the Restoration, he was a Renaissance Man in every sense of the word.  He won several fellowships for his scholarship, the most recent from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2000-2001. He was also the winner of several teaching awards, including 1993 Arizona Professor of the Year. He was especially proud of his service to the University of Arizona as chairman of President Manuel Pacheco's Task Force on Undergraduate Education in 1991-1992.<br />According to Rick Wallach, president of the Cormac McCarthy Society, Canfield was also a third degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and a national referee with AYSO. He coached his sons in several sports from the early 1970s until the mid-1990s, and co-coached and refereed a soccer team with his son Colin as recently as the fall 2002. His other hobbies were hunting and writing poetry, of which he has two books published. He has also authored a poetic drama on John Charles Fremont.<br />Rick Wallach, in a tribute to him at the McCarthy Society from which much of this review is garnered, said, \\"All of us who knew Doug were aware of his passionate commitment to social justice, and his favorite course to teach was \\"The Ideology of Human Rights,\\" His last wish was for world peace with justice. . .\\"<br />\\"Doug's wonderful long essay on Cormac McCarthy's Suttree, which he read at the Society's annual conference in Tucson last year, will be published sometime in the (we hope) near future...\\"	2003-07-09

It is hard to believe that this was published way back in 1961.  This book sits now on my most beloved shelf.  There is wit and sex and social commentary here, but the book rises above that.  It is ultimately a book with a message, about stoic courage and grace, although not everyone is ready for the wisdom here.  The book's ultimate message is that we should appreciate the moment and cherish those whom we love while we can.  That, as Marcus Aurelius said, life is just loaned to us and, we ought to be ready, at any time, to gratefully say, \\"Here, I return that which has been loaned to me.\\"	2003-01-27

But the suspense is in the unraveling of character.  There is certainly sex here but this is also a mind piece centering on the dichotomy between the pleasures of passion in the Now and the timeless contempation of those pleasures in Art.<br />The lurid book cover mirrors the smart and sexy content.  The title is accurate and drawn in a sensuous font, the s curve being particularly suggestive.  Only certain parts of the flesh ever get that color.  A fittingly sultry picture of the author is on the back flap.  Someone knew what they were doing.<br />Easy to read type, easy to open, and artsy and sexy all at once.  This was my first book by this author, and I'm glad to see that she has written others.  I hope they're all as fine as this one.	2002-09-07

Not just a book of letters, but a lusciously annotated treasure chest of biographical information, and not just on the Clarks, but on the frame of frontier history which surrounded them.<br />  The insights on William Clark and York are indeed interesting, but biographical sketches in the notes reveal arcane facts on Daniel Boone, General James Wilkinson, Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and many others less known but equally interesting.  Mr. Holmberg sometimes indulges in speculation and tentative assertions, but the demarcation between fact and inference is always clear.<br />The work is handsomely constructed, the font easy to read, the notes easy to follow.  A complete bibliography is provided along with a complete index.  All and all, a pleasure to peruse, a delight to own.	2002-09-07
US	53005995	R2LTRLKRI3UJI6	0963892703	206835432	Notes on Blood Meridian	Books	5	52	53	N	Y	An amazing, eye-popping study of McCarthy's masterpiece.	Out of print for many years, copies of the first edition of this book sold on Ebay for hundreds of dollars.  There was an outcry for a new edition, but John Sepich seemed to be as reclusive as Cormac McCarthy during the 1990s, and so we waited.    Finally, at long last, here it is.  Scholars everywhere will delight in this new edition.     McCarthy's masterpiece, BLOOD MERIDIAN, is based upon historical sources, not just Chamberlain's MY CONFESSSION, but a whole library of western memoirs and documents.  John Sepich documents and annotates the work here.  The real histories of many of McCarthy's characters are examined.  This edition features an easy-to-map of the locations named in the novel.    In addition, the literary, mythic, and cosmological allusions are itemized, discussed, explained, and indexed.  John Sepich, in association with other scholars, now maintains his own website and presents a concordance of the work which, last time I checked, was available for free.    I only wish the original cover artwork had been retained for the dustjacket, as the romantic picture here, so recently used on Per Petterson's Pulitzer-nominated OUT STEALING HORSES just has the wrong feel. It may grow on me in time.  But the text of the book is magnificently presented.    Those who already treasure BLOOD MERIDIAN will want to purchase the expanded hardcover edition of this work, which features two new essays by Sepich, \\"Knitting The Winds,\\" and \\"Why Believe The Judge?\\"  They are a definite treat.    All in all, the amazing work of scholarship worthy of the masterpiece it illuminates.	2002-04-22

This is not really for the casual reader, but for those who truly want to immerse themselves in the subject.  If you are looking for a concise history, look elsewhere.

This is the study an older man (56) who knows who he is and is content with books, introspection, and the quiet life.

Like all of Perez-Reverte's works, this book is  many things--history, mystery, and a mindgame.  I didn't think his mystery  lady here was a stereotype, but rather a sexy femme-fatale befitting the  nature of the yarn.  And he kept me guessing until the smashing end.   Bravo!	1999-06-30
