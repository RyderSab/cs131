It's an easy, entertaining and worthwhile read.<br /><br />We become more enlightened both directly (by the author's statements of his conclusions) and indirectly (by experiencing the analystical process and its clarity) by reading something like this.<br /><br />This book is a bargain.	2005-04-24

Sketching the evolution of civilization's thoughts about Logic, from Aristotle to Chomsky, this book touches on just about every question that is likely to occur to you about this fundamental topic. <br /> <br />Logic is key to our technology - yesteday, today and tomorrow - and key to a more profound understanding of ourselves. <br /> <br />This is a worthwhile book. It's a bargain. And the level of sophistication is appropriate for a wide audience. <br /> <br />	2004-11-07

It does just that.<br /><br />The format could almost be described as a \\"science comic book.\\"<br /><br />It's a readable and understandable survey of the experiments which led the big names of the time (Bohr, Einstein, Dirac, Pauli, Heisenberg and some others) to develop the theory.<br /><br />The book follows the story up to the challenge of non-locality. (What a cliff-hanger that is!)<br /><br />If you're technically oriented and want to begin to understand the subject - to get past the conceptual difficulties - you'll find this book really useful.	2004-10-30

This is the first I've read on this topic. <br /> <br />I think the authors offer a good survey of prominent thoughts about consciousness. <br /> <br />The format of the book is exceedingly easy to read. It's easy Not to get bogged down over some of the novel concepts that are discussed. <br /> <br />The veil has lifted, just a little. <br /> <br />I'm glad I read it. <br /> <br />	2004-10-30

This book will NOT make them an expert on the subject. <br /> <br />I've read other, more technical books on fractal geometry and chaos, so nothing here was brand new to me. <br /> <br />As for an introduction for the layman...well, that's a tall order if you hope to go beyond the \\"gee whiz!\\" phase with pretty pictures. For that, this book is probably as good as you can reasonably expect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-17

The author attempts to apply the notions of chaotic systems, fractals, non-linear systems to organizations, management and leadership.<br /><br />The author offers very interesting analogies and intuition to support her ideas. This is clearly a thoughtful book. And maybe someday some of the very interesting ideas expressed here will be known to have been insightful.<br /><br />However, analogies and intuition are seldom compelling enough to \\"make the case,\\" and such is the case here.<br /><br />If you're into organizational theory and things like that, then you will probably want this book on your \\"to read\\" list. If you're into non-linear systems and have wondered if/how they might be part of our organizations (workplace, etc.), then you would probably find the analogies interesting.<br /><br />This book is a worthwhile read for the analogies. I thought they were really interesting.	2004-10-10

A protective telling of the author's story. The love between the mother and the child...the anguish felt over their circumstances...never maudlin, always sweet...intimate sadness, a tender grief...an un-self-pitying resolve. I sensed all of these feelings and ideas on almost every page.<br />And, finally, the child becomes a young woman, intelligent, strong and loving.<br />I think of this as more than just another Horatio Alger story.	2003-08-01

In fact, had we known him, we might not have liked him (some did not). But we would have had to have understood that he was exceptional.<br />I didn't know before that he was so unwilling to be affectionate with those expected to be closest to him.<br />I didn't fully appreciate the genius of his scientific work.<br />I had always understood that he was a &quot;great compromiser&quot; and that this had been instrumental to the success of our nation's early history. I did not understand how this was a culmination of his personality and philosophy - and how it was forshadowed from his earliest years. <br />And why he has come to be seen as the prototypical American.<br />I can recommend this book without reservation.	2003-07-29

This book answered many long-standing questions for me.<br />It is a nice, friendly introduction to the basics of DNA...and also cell biology. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about such things. (I would recommend any of the  three TCL books I've read as excellent introductions to their respective topics.)<br />However, the authors of this particular book also inject a lot of their own particular philosophy of knowledge. This philosophy attempts to view everything as a Language.<br />This is an appealing notion, actually, but I found the attempts to draw convincing analogies between various disciplines to be less than compelling. Interesting, yes, but not entirely convincing. And because the analogies were less than entirely convincing, I found them to be a distraction from my original purpose in buying this book: to learn a little about DNA.<br />(And, in case any TCL'er is listening, I would suggest an exploration of Godel's Theorem as a worthy topic. I bet you could make this important idea accessible, too.)	2003-06-24

I found this book worthwhile and would recommend it to any scientist or technically oriented non-scientist.<br />The author demonstrates that cellular automata are capable of computing anything that can be computed by today's computing machines. He also shows that exceedingly simple rules can lead to exceedingly complex results. An implication of this is claimed to be that cellular automata can model most anything in the known universe and can serve as a model for exploring significant questions about our universe.<br />The author explores significant fields of science using the notions of cellular automata. For example, the chapter on biological evolution has many very interesting insights. The author also uses cellular automata to make what I would call a &quot;first order&quot; model of spacetime that includes the properties of time and causality. I found this to be quite interesting.<br />Reading this book also affords a glimpse for us non-braniacs into the course, from conception to fruition, of an actual scientific inquiry. This is a rare opportunity.<br />The author's intent, as I see it, is to offer ideas; to provide what I would call &quot;plausibility arguments&quot; for his claim that he has discovered a fundamental property of nature (the &quot;Principle of Computational Equivalence&quot;). I think he succeeds in making his claim plausible.<br />The author is not claiming that this book contains any actual, formal, scientific, final and conclusive proof of indisputable law by any completely rigourous method. <br />But our intuition can be notoriously misleading - that's why science is what it is.<br />While I am kind of impressed by this book, reviews by significant people in the scientific community seem to be mixed. <br />Therefore, paraphrasing what the author himself has said, the final review will be written only after a long time.	2002-08-03

For instance, the Internet caught even Bill Gates napping, according to the popular wisdom! It was staring him in the eye and he didn't see it until it bit him in the rear end.<br />This is a nice survey of where we are and what our imaginations are saying to us right now, but it is exceedingly hard to really see beyond the next decade or so, so most of this book is probably good only for entertainment and/or inspiration. And that's not bad.<br />But it only gets two stars. It wasn't really all that entertaining.	2001-08-19

It attempts to show how the quantum nature of things can result in a DNA molecule. I think it does a nice job and achieves its purpose.<br />The earlier reviewers make the book sound like it's almost beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals. I'm an ordinary mortal and I felt like I got the big ideas with no trouble. If you're a philosopher or physicist, maybe you would appreciate whatever subtleties are here, but an ordinary, interested, technically-oriented layperson should not think that this book is inaccessible. This book is very accessible.<br />Four stars instead of five because I think Mr. Schrodinger waxes a bit too &quot;intuitive&quot; once he departs from the scientific approach to things.	2001-04-12

After turning the last page, you will look up to a universe more  grand than before.<br />As my math studies went from the earlier to the  slightly more sophisticated, I often felt that something was missing, and I  had to work really hard to compensate for those gaps. This book maintains  its continuity throughout. It is articulate and coherent. It maintains what  I like to call a &quot;logical continuum.&quot;<br />I recommend it.

This book discusses the definition of the Radon transform, it's properties, it's relation to other transforms (Fourier, et al.), it's inverse, and so on. It is well documented. (It even contains a translation  of Radon's original 1917 paper!)<br />This book is the most useful source of  such information I've found, so far.
