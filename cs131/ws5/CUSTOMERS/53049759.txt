Not only does he love the horror genre, but he is a great storyteller with a great southern voice. I've never been disappointed by any of his books. (Only by the fact that he doesn't write fast enough.) THE POSSESSION is a kind of Civil War ghost story. A young couple move into an old mansion, formerly owned by a southern belle who was murdered by Union soldiers and whose husband returned to find her gone. The trauma and madness of that event seems to resonate to this day and the house is haunted literally and figuratively by the tragedy. A young couple moves in and finds that some dark force has chosen them to replay the tragedy... Kelly has a real talent for writing captivating stories with likeable characters and he delivers the goods when it comes to horror. My only complaint is that his last novel, FEAR, was written several years ago and he has vanished from from the scene. Where are you, Mr. Kelly? Your fans are waiting for something new from you and the genre needs you!	2003-11-14
US	53049759	R41S9SZ30G5FL	0843952180	453244711	Darkfall	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Wild ride.	Stephen Laws has a good reputation in the UK for his work and I was glad to see Dorchester exporting his work to the US. DARKFALL is a wild ride and I understand why UK fans are excited by his work. In this novel, an office highrise is struck by a kind of supernatural lightning storm that seems to bend reality. People vanish, some are sucked into the walls and spit out miles away and turned into superhuman crazies, and bizarre creatures are born of inanimate objects. A detective is on the case and finds a secret government organization on the scene investigating the events. These agents seem to be familiar with the phenomena but are unwilling to share what they know with the others. It is also becomes apparent that the evil behind it all cannot be tamed or controlled. The survivors find themsleves trapped in a house of horrors where anything is possible and the stuff of nightmares has collided with reality... Laws is an exciting export and my only fault with the book is that it is very British, seems kind of relentless (in an unbelievable way,) and the phenomena seems too incredible much of the time. All in all, I look forward to more of his work and think he is an author to watch. His imagination is a real stand out among many authors working in the genre today.	2003-11-13
US	53049759	R2FEHNWNAMZUOL	0821727044	660772351	Demon's Eye	Books	3	0	0	N	N	For horror fans only.	Let me be right up front: this book is not going to win any awards. The dialogue is silly, the characters are unbelievable caricatures, it's melodramatic, and the plot lacks coherence. (Gresham presents a plot then throws a lot of unexplained stuff into it.) But for horror fans, it is an entertaining yarn with some genuinely creepy scenes that you'll get a kick out of. I would liken this to a drive-in B-horror movie. The locale is creepy and there are some imaginative scenes (especially the \\"spider creatures\\".) The plot: Three families visit an old secluded inn to consider buying it as resort. Although the old mansion in the woods appears abandoned, it is occupied by  something evil (of course.) It is an entity that can appear as a young man but is actually a kind of demon and it does not want intruders in its home. Within a few days, the group finds themselves trapped and the creature begins to pick them off in some mysterious and nasty ways. Only a young boy with strange powers understands the danger and he alone can fight the demon... Pick this up if you appreciate horror in a b-movie vein. And if you like it, Gresham is a prolific author with more than a dozen horror books to his name, so you have a lot to look forward to. I'm giving this book 3 1/2 stars because Gresham obviously loves the genre and his passion comes across in his writing. I, myself, love horror fiction so much that I read the good and the bad, and I appreciate them both for what they are. For my tastes, there isn't enough horror fiction out there to please me.	2003-11-13

I've read nearly all of his novels and I have enjoyed each and every one of them. He has a few weaknesses that I hope he outgrows-- he relies too heavily on cliches and his plots lack sufficient depth sometimes-- but he is an exceptional storyteller and a relatively new writer who is still developing. He also understands the elements that make a good horror novel and BREED is no exception. It has a creepy monster (almost Lovecraftian with it's netherworld roots), likeable characters, and the kind of suspense that makes you turn the pages as fast as you can. All in all, Goingback is a writer that all horror fans can appreciate and BREED is a fun, quick read. To my mind, he has established himself as an author you can trust for a solid horror yarn.	2003-11-12
US	53049759	RD8PRM4DO57NU	0843952407	810038697	The Doorkeepers	Books	5	2	4	N	N	One of the masters.	When I think of the &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;, Graham Masterton has earned his place alongside King, McCammon, Dan Simmons, and Koontz. Masterton has written some of the most frightening and brilliant novels I've ever read. (NIGHT WARRIORS, WALKERS, PREY, MIRROR, and PARIAH, stand out in my mind.) He can make the incredible credible and he does not flinch when it comes to in-your-face terror. Read the first chapter of MASTER OF LIES, PREY, or the kitchen scene in NIGHT WARRIORS and they will leave the most jaded horror readers mouth agape. (And I'm not talking about gore for gore's sake. Masterton backs those elements up with brilliant storytelling and an amazing imagination.) THE DOORKEEPERS was a very satisfying read, but a little different than most of his horror novels. It is a little more fantastic (as in Fantasy) and there is nothing overtly supernatural to it. But it is a terrifying read nonethless and it had me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend it for all horror fans. Thank you for the ride, Mr. Masterton. You can't write fast enough for my tastes!	2003-11-12
US	53049759	RVHOUIEZQLT2A	0451201744	232812399	The Walking	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A captivating horror novel.	Bentley Little is one of the best authors in horror today. Even with his &quot;slips&quot;, you're guaranteed a good read with in-your-face-horror and edge of your seat suspense. THE WALKING has an overt supernatural theme at it's core. (More so than THE ASSOCIATION and THE POLICY, to name a few.) And as a lifetime horror fiction fan, it's these kinds of novels that thrill me the most. THE WALKING has a brilliant premise: people are dying on their feet but they don't lie down. They are walking. Some force is pulling them like a magnet towards a lake in Arizona and it is terrifyingly powerful. It penetrates dreams, animates the dead, and seems almost omniscent. Only a few survivors, whose loved ones have turned into zombies, believe what is happening and follow the dead towards the evil behind the madness... THE WALKING is a brilliant idea, with a backstory that is almost more interesting than the present day tale. Little burns up the pages with a wildfire of an idea and although some of the characters were lacking in depth and credibility, I found myself thinking about the book in between readings; the mystery of it occupying my mind like some nightmare puzzle. (What the heck is going on? What is behind it all? How does all this fit together?) The first half of the book was 5 stars all the way. But after Little completed the backstory, it seemed to lose steam and even the author didn't seem to know how to sew the threads together and make it satisfying. In the last quarter of the book, it was almost painful. Little seemed to be trying to write himself out of a box; characters were wandering around and rehashing all the pieces of the puzzle, looking for a resolution. I hate to say it but the ending was pretty disappointing. For all it's power, The Evil was kind of a pushover. In spite of these faults, Little's imagination and love and understanding for the genre outshines the best. I'm giving this 4 and a half stars and to newcomers, I would recommend UNIVERSITY, THE SUMMONING, and THE MAILMAN. You'll appreciate his work more and be more forgiving after you read his more successful efforts. All in all, I love the guy and will continue to snatch up everything he has to offer. Keep 'em coming, Mr. Little.SUMMONING, and THE MAILMAN. You'll appreciate his work more and be more forgiving after you read his more successful efforts.

Since his first novel, SUFFER THE CHILDREN, John Saul has been a consistent presence on the bestseller list and he has kept the horror genre alive in the mainstream for long time. Having read 3-4 of his novels--most of them highly recommended by other Amazon reviewers-- I have to admit: I just don't understand his success. It's true that he writes very engaging novels. His writing style is very compelling and his characters--for the most part-- are very likeable and indentifibable. But his plots are very cliched and they read like made-for-t.v. movies;  watered down, full of hokey ideas that have been done and done again, and ultimately they are pretty disappointing for horror fans. Why do I continue to read him? Because I love the horror genre with a wild passion, I guess, and there just isn't enough new stuff out tere to satisfy me. I also consider his success a bit of a mystery. Afterall, everything he does is a million copy bestseller and surely not all those people could be wrong, could they? But again and again I have been disappointed by his work and I find myself groaning out loud at how cheezy his books are. Unfortunately, MIDNIGHT VOICES is no exception. A widow meets a storybook prince charming and moves her two children into his apartment in NYC; it is a tenament building that has an odd reputation and even stranger tenants that seem very close to one another in a creepy way. Very quickly, the overly nice and elderly tenants become menacing (in a way that the children notice first, of course) and they seem to pay special attention to the youngsters, showering them with gifts and treats. Soon it becomes apparent that they need the children for some nefarious purpose and the widow must face the cabal os strange tenanats and fight for survival... I really want to like Saul. As a horror fanatic I would love nothing more. He has written enough books to keep me occupied for quite some time. But other than his talent for writing engaging novels, (thus the 3 star rating,) Saul just does not deliver the goods in my opinion. Everytime I turn the last page of one of his books, I swear 'no more!: And it suprises me because I love the genre so much I get an equal kick out of the good and the bad! Although he is good for the genre-- his success proves to publishers that the genre is marketable and profitibale-- I just cannot recommend this book to discerning horror lovers.

I was jonesing for something to read recently and decided to pick SOULSTORM back up and see if it was as good as I remembered. (It's probably been ten years since I first read it.) I picked it up a few days ago and from the first page, I found myself completely involved in it. I find myself looking forward to my lunch hour at work so I can jump back into the story. It's such a pleasure to read a horror novel from such a capable and talented author. The premise is somewhat familiar-- a group of people accept a challenge to stay in a house that is rumored to be haunted-- but Williamson's passion and imagination and storytelling ability is hypnotizing and this novel is uniquely his own. It is genuinely frightening (even for a jaded horror fanatic like me) and the characters seem to live and breathe on the page. It's such an exceptional book I've written two Amazon reviews for it! If you care about horror fiction, do yourself a favor and track this book down. As I mentioned, the premise is somewhat familiar-- Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE and Richard Matheson's HELL HOUSE come to mind-- but don't let that put you off. This book is outstanding in its own right, and is an under-appreciated classic. Thank you, Mr Williamson for a bloody good ride!	2003-11-11
US	53049759	R1NSOQA7D8CH83	0553579754	600228327	Fear Nothing	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Great fun.	I've been a fan of Koontz for many years but I've been a little annoyed with his more recent works. I get the impression that his success has intimidated his editor and Koontz \\"unplugged\\" is a bit over the top, melodramatic, and a little self indulgent. It almost-but not quite-- derails some of the enjoyment of his recent books for me. But Koontz has an amazing talent for storytelling and he is always compulsively readable and entertaining. FEAR NOTHING is a great ride; part thriller, part sci fi, and part horror. There were a few things that I found a little distracting about it, but overall it's a classic Koontz thrill ride. (The scene with the police chief was a real nail-biter. I could not turn the pages fast enough to see what happened.) The day I finished this book I immediately picked up the next in the series. I'm looking forward to more adventures with Snow, Sasha, Orson, and Bobby. Don't leave us hanging on the third book, Dean!	2002-12-07

Thomas Tessier is a talented author and I was pretty excited when I found a copy of this book. It was his first novel,  published in the late 80's, and the cover was distincly horror. I was hoping for something gritty and scary and I was curious to see what his \\"premier\\" was like. I'm sorry to say, that it was pretty disappointing. It had an interesting premise: Strange sentient lights begin appearing around a small town in various forms. Children see a luminescent blue mist that appears to them in the woods like a holy visitation. Others see it on the horizon like blue flames, dancing over the town. Before long, it turns dark and vicious and innocent people in the town are torn limb from limb when it manifests into a whirlwind-like poltergiest... Sounds pretty cool for a horror novel, huh? Unfortunately, Tessier didn't seem to know what to do with the idea. The characters are very well drawn and handled with above average skill but it's not enough to carry a story that runs out of steam about mid way through. Even with the action-packed final chapters, the story has no where to go and Tessier doesn't seem to care in the end. His explanation for the supernatural entity was very weak, almost as though he had painted himself into a corner and didn't know how to resolve it. I can't recommend this particular book, but I can recommend his later work. Tessier grew to become an excellent writer. His book PHANTOM is a much better introduction, for anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of reading his work.	2002-11-20

Paul Wilson brings together 5 of his previous novels with this apocalyptic horror fantasy that serves as a climax to his \\"Adversary Cycle\\". Characters and storylines come together during a series of fantastic and terrifying events occuring around the world. The sun itself defies physics by rising and setting earlier and the days begin to shrink. Giants holes open up in NYC's Central Park and around the globe and unleash hordes of monstrous insects that begin feeding like pirhanas on people. For humanity, it appears to be the beginning of The End and society begins to crumble. One man knows who and what is responsible, however. He brings together a band of frightened survivors and assembles a scattered weapon that might or might not put a stop to the evil behind the everlasting Night... This is a fantastic horror fantasy, complete with monsters, demons, and Lovecraftian creatures. It is a thrilling ride from beginning to end and I loved every second of it. A few have said that it can be read as a stand-alone novel, but I would recommend that readers check out the other books in The Adversary Cycle. (THE KEEP, THE TOMB, THE TOUCH, REBORN, and REPRISAL.) Some of the background and characterizations might seem a little thin, otherwise. NIGHTWORLD is a must for horror fans!	2002-11-18

Publishers started putting out really bad  books, throwing them at an audience they underestimated, underappreciated, and didn't consider intelligent (apparently.) So, they saturated the market with pure schlock and the public got so fed up that people stopped buying horror (except for the die-hard fans like me.) GHOULS is one of the many sub-par books that left a bad taste in readers mouths and pushed them to other genres. (Pinnacle and Zebra were the absolute worst offenders.)Lee is like a 7th grade kid on the playground when he writes; full of tired yuk-yuk macho sexual innuendos, throwing gore for cheap thrills-- because he doesn't understand how to scare readers-- and generally insulting the genre and it's fans by polluting the market with garbage.	2002-08-18

He and his partner stop for a quiet lunch and find themselves in a life or death gun battle with a crazed gunman. But it's only the beginning and things are about to get much worse. By sheer coincidence, Harry runs afoul of someone far more dangerous and far more powerful than a lunatic with a gun. It is a phantom he will come to call Ticktock and his abilities are superhuman. He is like a vengeful god and he makes a sport of punishing people and terrorizing them before he kills them. He gives Harry 24 hours to live and during that time, everything he loves is in danger unless he can put a stop to it... This is classic Koontz and a highly entertaining read. I've read nearly all of his work, but somehow never got around to this jewel until recently. He was in the top of his form during this time and I highly recommend picking this up for fast moving, suspenseful fun.	2002-07-28

New York City, 1974: Allison Parker has had a difficult life, but things are really looking up for her. After presiding over her father's funeral, she returns to her life in the big apple to start anew. She has a handsome boyfriend who is a succesful lawyer, a growing career as a model, and she has just moved in to the perfect apartment in an old brownstone. But Allison soon finds that her life is being controlled by unseen forces. The brownstone seems to reside between two worlds; one of light and one of darkness. And an old blind priest who lives in the apartment above her holds a secret that will shatter her world and could unleash the forces of hell on to all of humanity... This is a classic horror novel. It was made into an exceptional movie years ago and it's been on my reading list for ages. I wasn't sure if it would stand the test of time, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is genuinely creepy and has real fear in it. Highly recommended for horror fans.	2002-07-09

All of them will have to confront two battling demons where the winner takes all. Before it's all over there will be help from above and below. But will they be too late?... Michael Reaves gives us a wild modern-horror-fantasy that is epic in scope, but delivered in a meager 280 pages. Things move in a kind of staccato fashion and with some tongue-in-cheek humor that sometimes hurts the story's credibility. (Even though I laughed out loud a few times.) But the imagination of the author and a rich background that we're only given a glimpse of, makes it worthwhile and hints at more to come. Overall, an engaging and inventive book that I recommend for horror-fantasy fans.	2002-07-01

Back in 1987, before vampire fiction became it's own genre of a sort, Ray Garton gave us one of the most terrifying, erotic horror vampire novels ever published... A frustrated and depressed journalist finds himself drawn to a run down peep show in NYC's Time Square. It's out of character for him, but he is lonely and confused, having lost his fiance to another man. What he finds in the darkness of the club called \\"Live Girls\\" however, is like a terrifying wetdream. The woman who dances for him is hypnotically beautiful and alluring but what she demands of him will change his life forever. The woman is part of a cabal of vampires, working in the sex trade, and the secrets they hide inside \\"Live Girls\\", and in the basement of the club, are the stuff of nightmares... Garton was at the top of his game with this novel and horror fans still talk about it today, more than a decade later. It's one of my all time favorites and I still pick it up about once a year and reread it. The \\"things\\" in the basement of the club still gives me chills. If you're a horror or vampire fan, your book collection has a huge gaping hole in it if you don't own a copy of this book. Highest recommendation.	2002-06-29

And the old woman who will stay in the upstairs room won't be a burden, will she? Naaahhhh. So the knuckleheaded family settles into this creepy mansion and find themselves prey to some dark force that permeates the house. And hell hath no fury like the crazy old broad in the upstairs room...This is a classic from the old school of horror. Stephen King cited it as an influence on his masterwork THE SHINING and I could see several similarities. And like that classic, this is a kind of slo-motion slide into madness that really creeps into your psyche while you read it. Highly recommended for horror fans who want to appreciate the old school stuff.	2002-06-26

It was all black with a severed doll's head on it staring out with luminescent evil eyes. I was already a horror fan at that age, but I still hadn't put all my childhood fears away, and I remember putting the book face down several times because the eyes on the cover gave me the heebie jeebies. When I finally got around to reading it, it wasn't quite as scary as the cover, but it was a fun read from Britain's master James Herbert and genuinely creepy... A man finds himself the sole survivor of an airplane crash that kills hundreds. He is left with a confusion of memories and a survivor's guilt that pushes him to investigate the crash. What he finds is something reaching out from the grave and a shocking revelation... I've been a Herbert fan every since I read his amazing (and incredibly violent) THE DARK. This isn't up to the same calibur as that book but it's a quick, fun read and has a very creepy feel to it. Recommended for horror fans.

And they consider humans easy prey... This is a classic take on the werewolf legend. I was 12 or 13 when the book came out and I remember it scaring the hell out of me. The novel is well researched and has a gritty modern day reality to it; from the details of police work to theories on animal intelligence and wolf behavior. Strieber's approach is very credible and very scary. I'll admit, I prefer my werewolves as traditional man/wolf hybrids, but this was a fun read and a must for horror fans.	2002-06-17

In Whispering Pines, NC, the old Red Church has stood as a dark testament to a family's twisted beliefs and a vigilante killing many years ago in the small mountain community. Nobody can forget the day a congregation rose up and hung their preacher, Wendell McFall, for his twisted beliefs. Now his offspring has come to town and opened the old church back up. He is taking up where his ancestor left off and according to him, \\"Sacrifice is the currency of God.\\"... This is a pretty wild ride. Nicholson employs monsters, cannibalism, the undead, ghosts, and a disturbing zealotry that creates quite a witch's brew of a horror novel. And his passion really burns up the pages. Highly recommended for horror fans.	2002-06-09

I'm an obsessed horror fan and I read everything I can get my hands on, but oddly enough I don't care for vampire fiction all that much. It's a subject that's been done to death in my opinion and as a rule it kind of bores me. (With some exceptions, of course.) For years, I passed over Martin's FEVRE DREAM, thinking it was just \\"another vampire novel\\". But if you are lucky to come across a copy of this novel, don't make the same mistake I did. FEVRE DREAM is far more than just a vampire novel. It is a brilliant novel, period. I was so spellbound by this book, my house could have fallen down around me while I was reading it, and I probably would not have noticed. By the time I turned the last page, it had ranked itself as one of the best novels I have ever read. George R.R. Martin skills as a storyteller are unparalleled. I'm actually jealous of the fantasy and sci fi fans who've had his attention over the years. FEVRE DREAM has all the elements of the great classics of literature: larger than life characters, a perilous journey, and a story that sweeps you away like the river it is set upon... In a nutshell, it is a tale of vampires clashing on a steamboat in the 1850's. Two \\"bloodmasters\\", Joshua York and Damon Julian, are on a collision course of ideals and philosophy, and God help all those who are witness to it. The river will run with blood before it is all over... I'll never forget the cast of characters: the cruel and sick Sour Billy, the beloved curmudgeon Cap'n Abner Marsh, Hairy Mike Dunn, Joshua York, or Tobey the cook. I have never used the word \\"masterpiece\\" in a book review, but this book merits the term. Highest recommendation. You'll never forget this book once you turn the last page, I guarantee it.	2002-06-02

Not when the cover has menacing yellow eyes staring through an old door and a blurb that says \\"What you can't see can kill you!\\" I mean hey, that's the recipe for pure fun to a horror geek like me. And as cheesy as all that sounds, I'm happy to say it was actually pretty entertaining in a late-night creature-feature kind of way... People are being mutilated and abducted in a small Colorado town. Some creature seems to be stalking the snowy mountains and swooping out of the night sky to snatch it's victims. Federal agents are on the case, along with a few locals, and things go from bad to worse as they find that there is more than one creature and humans aren't at the top of the food chain anymore. (The locals also find that the feds are almost as unpleasant as the bloodthirsty critters.)... Douglas Hawk has cranked out a fun creature feature with THE DEVOURING. If you enjoy fast moving horror-action with a strong B-movie flavor to it, check this one out.	2002-05-22

I've been a fan of Christopher Golden for a long time, every since I read his OF SAINTS AND SHADOWS, but with this Young Adult horror series, I have been hanging on his every word. (Which is funny for a 35 year old.) Each book has been better than the last and with this entry Golden outdoes himself... Jack (\\"The Giant Killer\\") Dwyer and his gang-- Courtney, Molly, Artie, Eden, and Bill-- find themselves drawn into a complex web of deceit and terror as Jasmine, the alpha of a huge pack of Prowlers in NY City, looks for revenge against the humans who murdered her lover, Owen Tanzer. By killing Jack-- who has become a kind of living legend, to his surprise-- Jasmine hopes to bring together all the Prowlers across the continent and overthrow humanity once and for all. In the process, however, her grand scheme lauches a war not only between humans and prowlers but pits prowlers against prowlers in a final battle for supremacy. When it's over, nobody will be the same... It's my understanding that this is the last of the series for the forseeable future and it comes as a huge disappointment. Rarely have I become so involved in a series of books and I'll miss all of the characters like old friends. Thanks for the ride, Mr. Golden, it's been a great one. I hope you'll let us revisit Jack and his friends again in the future. In the meantime, I'll continue to buy anything with your name on it!	2002-04-27

I was already a fan of Boyll's after his first novel MONGSTER, but CHILLER took my breath away. It was wild and gruesome and even disturbing to a jaded horror fan like me... A desperate man races across country to find the doctor who used his daughter as a guinea pig in a twisted experiment. An experiment in which she died, but is still horribly and impossibly alive; a living dead girl who is slowly rotting away. Packed in ice to slow the decaying process, the man does everything in his power to save his daughter and confront the doctor, including robbing banks and stealing cars. With the FBI on his tail, a daughter who is literally rotting away, he races to a final confrontation that will leave you chilled to the bone... Out of print and hard to find, but well worth the search. Boyll's CHILLER lives up to it's name.	2002-04-07
US	53049759	R3CLGN19R77WLZ	0671626299	480740974	Crucifax	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Gruesome horror chiller.	Ray Garton raised eyebrows in the horror community when he came onto the scene with SEDUCTIONS and DARKLINGS (a favorite of mine) but it was his third novel LIVE GIRLS that earned him cult status among fans and it is still reverred as one of the most frightening vampire novels ever written. CRUCIFAX was his paperback follow up to that novel and it proved him to be a leader among a new generation of horror authors. His work set a new standard in the genre, mainly involving in-your-face horror  and gore (which later became known as the Splatterpunk movement, I believe.) CRUCIFAX is a kind of play on The Pied Piper story in a modern setting, but infinitely darker and more terrifying. The Piper in this case is a dark and dangerous man who insinuates himself in with all the bored and jaded and runaway teenagers in a CA town. A young man (who has a very complicated relationship with his little sister,) begins to worry about her when she joins what has become a cult of personality around the dark man. But the young man has no idea what is in store for him when he decides to rescue her. The man who holds her is evil incarnate. And not only does he have the power of psychic domination over the cult members, he commands a pack of wolverine-rat-like creatures that he uses on those who try to fight him... Garton's strengths are his characters and his passion. It burns in a clear, crisp writing style that makes for compelling reading. Keep in mind, however, CRUCIFAX is unapolgetic horror and things get very bloody. (In fact, there is an infamous chapter missing from this mass market paperback that apparently didn't make it past the editor and was later included in a small press \\"writer's cut\\" edition called CRUCIFAX AUTUMN.) When Garton does horror, (and he doesn't write enough of them for my tastes) there are few out there that can match him. Highly recommended.	2002-04-07

Everybody who appreciates horror fiction should have a Joseph Payne Brennan collection on their nightstand. His short fiction is expertly designed for late night reading when the dark is peering in through the cracks in the blinds and something is scratching at the window that might or might not be a tree branch. Widely published in the late fifties up until the 70's, Brennan perfected the pulp horror tale with unmatched skill. In the introduction to this particular anthology, Stephen King describes Brennan as one of the masters of pulp horror fiction and he is right on the money. (And when I use the word &quot;pulp&quot;, I use it with all the respect and reverence the classification deserves. Forget about the literary snobs who use the word as an insult.) THE SHAPES OF MIDNIGHT contains two of his classics &quot;Slime&quot; and &quot;Canavan's Backyard&quot; which King praises as the literary equal to Faulkner's &quot;A Rose For Emily&quot;. Brennan's work is full of ancient Egyptian curses, things that crawl from the swamp, eyes under the bed, and the collision of reality and nightmare in the mundaness of every day life. Brennan is an author to seek out if you care about horror fiction and enjoy reading under the covers with a flashlight. His work is also great for reading out loud to your significant other late at night, shivering under the covers.	2002-04-03

At more than 1000 pages it seems like a helluva mountain to climb and I can understand the hesitation a lot of people have when they first pick it up. (It's a hefty muther, so remember to lift with your legs!) But as intimidating as it may seem, the reward in the end is extraordinary and it is a journey you will never forget... A group of children, struggling to survive the cruelties of being outsiders and \\"geeks\\", find themselves battling for the survivial of the entire town when the epitome of the boogeyman crawls forth from beneath the town. The creature takes the shape of a demented clown named \\"Pennywise\\", but like the devil, it is legion and can take many guises; capitalizing on their individual and most personal fears. Through sheer bravery and desperate love for one another, they manage to slay the beast and send it back to where it came from. Decades later, however, as adults who have all gone their separate ways, they are called back home by one of their members who stayed behind as a kind of Watcher. The evil has returned, he tells them, and it is up to them to finish the job they started as children. But the unspeakable IT (aka Pennywise) is expecting them and it will make them pay for what they did to it those many years ago... As big as this book is, and as intimidating as it seemed when you first opened the cover, turning the last page will break your heart. It is a novel to be cherished again and again.	2002-04-03

I don't know what I can say about this book that 200+ reviewers haven't already said, but as a life long horror fan, I have to say this is probably the most frightening horror novel I've ever read. It set a new standard for the genre and no one has surpassed it since, including King himself, in my opinion. It is an unforgettable journey into madness and supernatural horror. When I turned the last page, I felt as though I had just washed up on the shore of the river Styx. If you are one of those people who have put off reading it because \\"you've seen the movie\\" then I implore you to pick it up. It's an experience you'll never forget and a modern classic.	2002-03-31

This is my third or fourth Saul novel and again I find myself a little disappointed. I like his writing style. He writes in a clear, compelling way and his work is really suspenseful and engaging. (You have to give the guy that. He can write a page-turner.) It's just that I never feel very satisfied when I finish one of his books. For me, the horror elements seem too watered down and ambiguous. And often times, they seem to conclude in a Scooby Doo kind of way. (A quick, pat explanation with the suggestion perhaps nothing supernatural ever occured.)COMES THE BLIND FURY has a pretty creepy premise and I had high hopes for it: a young blind girl in the 1800's is accidentally killed when a group of cruel children tease her and she falls to her death from a cliff. More than a century later, a family moves into The House and their adopted daughter, Michelle, begins to have visions of the blind girl, Amanda. Over time, Michelle grows closer to what her parents think is an imaginary friend, but what Michelle considers a real person that appears to her out of darkness and fog. Soon, the lives of Michelle and Amanda start to mirror each other when Michelle is injured and becomes a cripple. Children begin to tease her and she finds herself turning to Amanda as her only friend. But Amanda wants revenge for the laughter she heard as she fell to her death that day. And using Michelle \\"for her eyes\\", she starts to kill. (Or does she? Perhaps Michelle is simply disturbed. It's suggested as a possibility.) As children die in mysterious accidents, the family begins to unravel, and the town turns against them... I actually enjoyed this book more than Saul's other novels I've tried, but to me his work is kind of like a made-for-tv movie; sort of cheezy, melodramatic, and without any real graphic horror. I'm giving it 3.5 stars because it was definitely a page turner and had a creepy premise, but I don't know if I'll try any more of his work. Maybe my expectations as a horror fan are just too high (or jaded), but Saul doesn't deliver for me.ust too high (or jaded), but Saul doesn't deliver for me.	2002-03-25

Because I had never heard of this author before and the cheezey cover along with the goofy play on words for a title, I didn't have high expectations for this book. But I have an insatiable appetite for horror novels-- the good and the bad-- and I gladly slapped down the cash for it, glad that there was something new on the horror shelf (back in 1990 when the horror boom of the 80's was dying quickly.) But I got a very pleasant surprise when I began to wade into the book. It was pretty... good! The plot wasn't entirely original, but it's a fun theme that has cool potential. In this case, a strange man opens an even stranger movie theater in a small town and plants seeds of madness in the minds of movie goers. Years later, a man is forced to exorcise those demons conjured in the theater and we follow him into a bizarre world where horror movies and the real world begin to collide... This was a really fun, surprisingly creepy book. It's probably hard to find, but worth looking for if you enjoy horror with a strong b-movie flavor and some genuine chills. My only complaint is that the author disappeared from the scene after an exceptional \\"premier\\".	2002-03-20

I think this was my first Costello book and after I read it I started keeping my eye on the C's at my local bookstore, doing a hard target search for more of his work. I've now read all of his horror novels and he's become a favorite author of mine. MIDSUMMER is a great introduction to his work and a great, creepy read...A young boy arrives at his grandmother's farm for a summer of fun and sun. Unfortunately for him and the nearby town, something else has come to visit. Something that escaped from a remote research post in the Antarctics and is spreading a kind of parasitic organism that takes human hosts and is driven to spread it's evil mutation. The climax comes during the town's summer carnival where all hell breaks loose... An exceptional read for horror fans and an author to seek out. Costello delivers in a fast paced, crisp manner and has a real talent for building nail-biting suspense. Great stuff for horror fans.	2002-03-19

Perhaps the silly covers that Zebra slapped on most of her novels have discouraged people from taking her seriously. But she really does know how to craft a good chiller and despite a few stumbles in her large volume of work, she's a horror author you can trust for a good story and genuine chills. Knowing all this, and having enjoyed several of her books, CELIA really took me by surprise. This is by far, one of the creepiest novels she's ever written... CELIA has lived with fear and violence for most of her life, every since she married Durk, a psychotic and strange man who seems to have some weird affinity with the swamp behind their Florida home. In a desperate act, to save her life and three children, she kills him and pushes him into the swamp. But his reign of terror will not end there and she knows it. \\"I'll come get you, Celia,\\" he always promised her. \\"You kill me and I'll come back as your worst nightmare.\\" With the help of an Underground Railroad of lawyers and shelters and good samaritans who assist abused women and families, Celia escapes with her children. A new identity and new life awaits her on the otherside of the US. But none of her rescuers know what happened that dark night in the swamp and none of them know that Durk is on their trail. Not even death has stopped him and he has become a slithering, crawling demonic thing that seems to embody the darkness of the swamp. No matter how far Celia travels or the protection of a strong, kind man named Mel, the creature that was once Durk will get his revenge on Celia and her children... Fast-paced, full of creepy-crawling darkness, and truley harrowing. This is an exceptional read for horror fans and one of Jensen's best. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Highly recommended.	2002-03-10

I've spent a lifetime obsessed with and reading horror fiction and SUMMER OF NIGHT is without a doubt one of the finest contributions to the genre I've ever read. Terrifying, heart-wrenching, riveting, magical, and moving. It is on par with Stephen King at his absolute finest and even beyond it. It is as much a journey as it is a book, with characters that you will cheer for, laugh with, fear for, and weep for. And as a horror novel should be, it is genuinely terrifying and harrowing.

The residents of a small town find themselves snowbound in one of the harshest winters on record. If nature's wrath isn't enough to contend with, there is something on the loose in the town. Something cursed and less than human and raging with blood lust. A young man and aspiring journalist finds evidence of an ancient curse and suspects the unspeakable when people begin to die in what appears to be animal attacks: a lycanthrope!...

A chosen few, including a washed up parapsychologist, recognize it as a demonic and physical entity and fight against it as the living fog-like darkness grows exponentially... As a lifetime horror fan, I have read this novel several times and it never ceases to amaze and terrify me. It is unapologetically gruesome, absolutely harrowing, and will have you gasping out loud as you turn the pages. If you appreciate horror, this book is a must. It's slightly dated and Herbert employs a few horror cliches in the telling, but it doesn't hurt the story in any way. A horror classic of the first order.

The more of his work I read, the more I become convinced of that. And even when the subject matter is unapologetically outrageous-- as it is in the case of THE WELLS OF HELL-- Masterton manages to pull it off with genuine terror and a nudge and a wink of black humor in the process... A small town in Conneticut finds an ancient evil beneath the ground. A living entity with power over water and an infectious mutation that turns people into crustaceous monsters... Masterton has fun with the idea and supports it with a credible backstory and history of ancient curses and Lovecraftian gods. Great fun, good horror, and another jewel from one of the most incredible imaginations and brilliant storytellers in horror fiction. Masterton NEVER disappoints.	2002-03-05

Gary Brandner is &quot;The Godfather&quot; of the modern horror novel in my opinion. Along with Stephen King, he helped launch the horror boom of the late 70's/early 80's with his classic THE HOWLING. It was also the first adult horror novel I ever read and it ignited my passion for the genre that continues to this day. (It's more like an obsession, really.) CAMERON'S CLOSET is one of my favorites. A series of bizarre and grotesque murders occur around a young boy. A detective and child psychologist feel there is some connection to the boy's &quot;invisible friend&quot; in his closet and some experiments the boy's father performed on him to nurture some latent psychic ability. But before they can exorcise the boy's personal demons, a beast is unleashed beyond the control of the boy and it's hunger is insatiable... Brandner's writing is clear, concise, and very compelling. He has keen sense of how to tell a good story and he knows what readers want from a horror novel. One of his best and highly recommended.	2002-02-26

Gary Brander's HOWLING was the first adult horor novel I ever read (back in 1978, when I was 11 or 12) and I credit it with launching my lifetime love (and obsession) for horror fiction. It's a bit tame by today's standards, but it is so engaging and neat, that I still find myself picking it up every few years to relive the excitement and delightful terror that it inspired in me the first time I read it... A young woman is brutally raped and under the advice of her therapist, she and her husband vacation in a small rural town called Drago. Despite the picturesque town and it's beautiful forests, the citizens of Drago are hiding a dark secret. A secret betrayed by an inhuman howling that echoes through the night beneath the full moon. The young woman soon finds that nothing is as it seems and soon she will be running for her life from mythical horrors... Brander's clear, concise writing and his tight plotting serve the story very well and it has genuine creepiness in it. (Something that's missing from a lot of modern horror fiction.)

This is one of those rare novels that made such an impression on me that I have actually dreamed about it on several occassions. It is the story of a parcel of densely wooded land near the Smoky Mountains called Wildwood. It is a place where twisted creatures, part animal and part man, roam; both beautiful and terrifying. And where a rich mogul, Mad Edgar Langford's chateau seems to blink in and out of existence after disappearing during a masquerade ball in the 1900's. Farris' writing style has depth and emotion that goes beyond most modern authors. His ideas are richly realized and wildly original and his characters are as close to real as the printed word allows. This is a horror/fantasy blend that seduces with dark and wondrous magic. Highest recommendation.	2002-02-25

She has penned at least 3-4 novels with that theme that I know of. And the subject matter may sound a little goofy on the surface, but the crazy thing is they're all pretty darn entertaining and creepy. I've always thought Jensen was underappreciated by the horror community. Yes, she's written a few clunkers (THE LAKE comes to mind) but the truth is this prolific author has churned out some exceptional stuff and she ALWAYS delivers the goods and tells an entertaining creepy story. (LOST AND FOUND is probably my favorite.) Jensen understands horror and orchestrates real fear and suspense in her books. THE LIVING EVIL is her \\"devil doll epic\\". At 477 pages, the story follows the curse of an evil doll named Zenoa through several generations of a family; beginning in 1870 and ending in 1993. If you enjoy horror novels with a B-movie flavor to them and appreciate good creepy fun, then I highly recommend this novel.

US	53049759	R10VUYT3Q0L8WU	0812522052	918986671	Charnel House	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Early Masterton	I'm a huge fan of Masterton's work and although CHARNEL HOUSE is one of his earlier novels I just recently got around to reading it. Masterton has a talent for taking real myths and bringing them into a modern day context. He does his homework on the subject and it makes his work credible and very eerie. CHARNEL HOUSE is about an American Indian demon that has orchestrated it's rebirth into our world through an old house in San Francisco. It becomes apparent to a small group of people that all of humanity is on the brink of extinction should the demon succeed. Things go from bad to worse as they rally themselves to try and stop it and there's some genuinely creepy elements to the story. I think so highly of Masterton it's hard for me to be critical, but it's fairly transparent that this is his early work. He was just starting to hit his stride with this novel (in my opinion) and it's a little rough in places and not as convincing (especially towards the end,) as most of his later work. It's still good stuff, however, and recommended to Masterton fans and horror fans.	2001-12-19
US	53049759	R4KHSTJ9CYDIY	0812521854	377628402	Night Warriors (Death)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Wild horror-fantasy chiller.	I've been on a Masterton kick for the past couple of months and recently reread this gem after many years...A group of strangers come together at the scene of a gruesome death. A nude woman is found on the beach, her stomach writhing with freakish, bloodthirsty eels. The strangers soon learn that their meeting is more like fate and what they have witnessed is the birth of the \\"nightspawn\\", the brood of an ancient demon that lives in the nightmares of humanity. The demon is on the verge of invading the waking world and the group is enlisted by a strange, angel-like creature that tells them they are the living inheritors to the legacy of the \\"night warriors\\", a group who can leave their bodies and move through the world of men's dreams to fight the demon... Masterton has one of the most amazing imaginations in all of horror fiction and this first in a trilogy (where nearly all of the books stand-alone,) is a gruesome thrill-ride. It has some of the most grotesque and memorable scenes in all of horror fiction. There's a scene where a housewife gives birth to more of the nightspawn and it is one of the bloodiest and most outrageous scenes I've ever read. I was gasping out loud as I read it. For Masterton fans and horror fans, this book is a must. The more of his work I read, the more I'm beginning to think that he is one of the best horror writers working today.	2001-12-19

I've been reading a lot of Graham Masterton lately and with each book, I've turned the last page with more appreciation and wonder at his talent and imagination. I finally got around to reading WALKERS recently and it blew me away. Masterton really outdid himself with this one. It is one of the fastest moving novels he's ever done and in some ways, his most outrageous. I felt like I had jumped into a moving car when I sat down to read it... Jack Reed comes across his life's ambition in the woods of Wisconsin: an old derelict building that was once a sanitarium known as The Oakes. Abandoned for almost 60 years, Reed sees potential in it as a future resort or country club. He learns very quickly, however, that it harbors dark and dangerous secrets and it has chosen him to open it's Pandora's Box of horrors. 135 patients vanished inside the place in the 1920's and they have been living inside it's very walls. Not behind the walls, mind you, but IN the walls. They will stop at nothing to free themselves, including kidnapping Reed's own son. And once they are free of the confines of The Oakes property, they go on a bloodthirsty spree across the city and state... Masterton pulls no punches with WALKERS. It is unapologetically bloody and fast moving, (almost, but not quite, to a fault.) Highly recommended for horror fans who think they've read it all...	2001-12-18

I've been singing the praises of Graham Masterton's work for years and I think he is a hugely underappreciated author. As a lifetime lover of horror fiction, I consider him one of the great masters in the genre. I owned a copy of THE PARIAH for years but somehow never read it and then lost my copy. I recently purchased it through Amazon's UK site and couldn't wait to open the cover. For two days I was absolutely enthralled by it. THE PARIAH is outstanding. It's one of Masterton's absolute best... In Granitehead, Massachusetts the dead will not stay buried. For hundreds of years, grieving relatives have found themselves haunted by the dead. Apparitions that reach out to them and lure them into the land of the dead. John Hyatt has lost his wife and is terrorized by her ghost only days later. He soon finds that he is not alone and something very dark is happening in Granitehead. Something evil is submerged beneath the harbor in the ruins of an old ship, the David Darke. Something that has imprisoned those who have died in the area and is feeding off the hearts of the living. Even worse, it appears to be escaping it's watery grave... If you've never had the pleasure of reading any of Masterton's work, this is a fantastic place to start. A 5 star book all the way.	2001-11-20
US	53049759	R1KTK56XFXTYF2	0445202777	446163632	Throwback	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Schlock Theater	First, let me just say: Wow. This book is like a 70's drive-in creature feature where you can see the zipper on the monster's back. It's entertaining in a throw-your-popcorn-at-the-screen kind of way, but it's also hilariously and unbelievably bad. (And a cheap rip off of Graham Masterton's THE MANITOU.) A woman grows a monster on the back of her neck and after several attempts by doctors to remove it (it grows back at one point) the monster is born and the woman runs around with a bloodthirsty critter attached to her back. I was laughing hysterically through the last 50 or so pages when the monster grows legs and starts carrying the woman around on it's back and runs loose in a mall with a SWAT team chasing it. If you enjoyed old horror movies like IT'S ALIVE and BASKETCASE, then you'll have fun with this book. I'm giving it three stars because I appreciate the kind of horror schlock that inspired it, but again let me just say: Wow.	2001-10-11

This was one of the first adult horror novels I ever read and as a lifelong horror fan, it holds a special place in my heart. A woman finds herself stalked by a dark sexual demonic entity that possesses various people around her, trying to take her as it's mate. The sexual content of this book was pretty scandalous at the time and the horror and suspense is outstanding. If you are a horror fan, do yourself a favor and seek this gem out. Brandner is the Godfather of Modern Horror Fiction as far as I'm concerned.	2001-10-10

He is a great storyteller and has a clear, cinematic style to his work. This sequel to his first PROWLERS novel, follows young Jack Sawyer on his journey to destroy the menacing Prowlers; a race of shape-shifting werewolves that live among humans. Jack is guided by a deceased friend and others in the &quot;Ghostlands&quot;. He has the ability to see the other side and tries to avenge their deaths by the prowlers. This time, Jack and Molly, follow a bloody trail to a small rural town where the Prowlers seem unusually active. A great read and an action packed horror thriller. I can't wait for the next in the series. Thank you Mr. Golden!	2001-10-10
US	53049759	R3LPOPKYQ8MPHH	0843926147	818043808	Strands	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Outstanding, gruesome horror thriller	STRANDS is an outstanding and gruesome horror novel. I read it many years ago and recently picked it up to see if it was as good as I remembered and it was. It tells the story of a man who is hung by a group of vigilantes. The murderers are not 100% sure of the man's guilt but seem to need to punish someone for the rape and murder of a young girl in the town. Once the deed is done, the men cut up the hanging rope and distribute pieces (or strands) of it as a reminder of the deed, so everyone will remember their part in the act. Decades later, as the son of the hanged man comes to town to try and understand what happened, the members of the hanging party are killed by the vengeful spirit of the dead man AND even the spirit of the murdered girl. This is a fantastic novel of revenge beyond the grave and has real fear in it. Not for the faint hearted but highly recommended for fans of horror. From what I've read, it is Kisner's finest acheivement.	2001-10-10

There just aren't enough of them out there these days to satisfy me. And I even enjoy the bad ones if they're fun. This one, however, was awful. I hated every one of the characters by the third or fourth chapter. The female protagonist is overly sensitive, paranoid, sees ominous signs in just about everything, (then obsesses about it for several pages,) and she faints 3 or 4 times before the book is half way through. The husband is a dolt, hot tempered, and also easily offended. The son is just a hateful brat. I guess the author wanted to create \\"family tensions\\" as a backdrop to the \\"spooky happenings\\" but it was so poorly done and unrealistic you'll hate these melodramatic people half way through the book. And even the supernatural elements are ham-handed and absurd. Over all, an amazingly bad book and really disappointing. ...	2001-08-06

A family moves into an old house and finds violence and evil in it's past. An evil that seems to resonate still, threatening their lives... Fahy is really an underappreciated writer.

It made me a fan of his and I've been looking for his novels every since. A young boy, who leads a kind of tortured existence at the hands of schoolyard bullies and a cruel father, discovers an amazing talent: He can leave his body. As the boy's life begins to fall apart, he is lured towards the dark side of his new power and the hunger for revenge... This was a great read and Fahy did a fantastic job with it.

A doctor begins to suspect a relationship between strange acts of violence and an ecological curiosity at a near by lake. The fate of the town and her own son's life are at stake, unless she can find an explanation and a cure... This is a great read and very fast paced. There's enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing until the very end of the book. It's also pretty violent, almost bordering on horror at times. Highly recommended.	2001-07-14

The subject of this book is a shocking true crime story. (Soon to be a major motion picture, blah, blah, blah.) But Schutze treatment of it is sloppy, contradictory, and very weak.

A detective who creates games on the side and drives a Porche, Davenport is pulled in on the case of a serial killer nicknamed &quot;Maddog&quot;.

It's been several years since I read this gem, (and it's about time to pick it up again,) but it's one of my all time favorite horror novels. A mysterious dark man reopens an old abandoned theater in a small town in Georgia. What he projects on the screen, and how he begins to manipulate members of the town, make for some of the creepiest nightmares I've ever read. Strickland's talent is on par with Stephen King, here. The depth of his characterization and storytelling ability is brilliant. My only criticism is that he hasn't done more in the genre. Highest recommendation for horror fans.	2001-06-27

I was so enthralled I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.

Brilliantly plotted and incredibly suspenseful. You won't be able to put this book down until it's harrowing climax.	2001-06-23

It's one of the creepiest and most suspenseful books Koontz (or anyone!) has ever done. It had me absolutely spellbound. A young doctor finds herself in custody of her teen sister after their parents die suddenly. They arrive in a small mountain community to start their new lives together. What they find, however, is not the small town that the doctor has come to love. They find a ghost town. All the residents are either missing or found dead, their faces frozen in terror. And what ever is responsible seems to be watching their every move... This is the closest thing to horror that Koontz has ever done and it is one wild ride. An amazing and gruesome horror thriller from Koontz in the top of his form. Highest recommendation!	2001-06-23

A chance encounter with a strange old woman in a mall parkinglot, marks a mother and her little boy for death. The woman is the head of a religious cult and she sees the boy as the antichrist. Mother and child find themselves on the run from a bloodthirsty cult that seems to be everywhere. Not even the police can help them as they run for their lives... This is classic Koontz. It is one of the most suspenseful and harrowing novels he's ever done. Highest recommendation!	2001-06-23

There is something so engaging and suspenseful and passionate about those earlier novels that I really think he was in the top of his form back then. SHADOWFIRES stands out as one of his best. Beautiful and intensely-likeable Rachel Leben has finally escaped the neglect and cruelty of her husband, brilliant genetecist Eric Leben. Or at least she thinks she has. But Eric's hate for her (mainly for leaving him which in turn humiliates him) becomes a force of nature. Nothing will stop him from destroying her. Not even death... I've read this book at least twice now and will probably read it again. It's a classic \\"chase novel\\" with a creepy blend of science and horror and suspense. Highly recommended.	2001-06-23

But because it's so damn entertaining and creepy. A demonic entity is posessing the minds of people, turning them into homicidal maniacs. One man has seen the creature &quot;in between&quot; hosts and recognizes it as some kind of parasitic demon. He stalks the creature across the US and finds it on a remote island up north where the residents find themselves cut off for several weeks every winter. Can he stop it before it kills everyone on the island? The author, Warner Lee, has a lot of fun with this story line and delivers some honest to God chills and thrills. If you enjoy horror and appreciate crisp writing and good, action packed story-telling, do yourself a favor and find this rare book. It's like a well executed b-movie at the drive-in. Highly recommended for horror fans.	2001-06-16

His physical and mental scars, however, are the least of his worries. Bizarre supernatural manifestations begin to occur and it seems as though Death itself and the forces of Hell want another chance at his soul... This is another, highly entertaining horror novel from Warner Lee. He really pulls out all the stops with this one. The manifestations that plague the protagonist are nightmarish and wild and the story has a fun, b-movie flavor to it. Hard to find, but recommended for horror fans.	2001-06-16

A kind of wraith that whispers to her and incites her to kill... Jensen is a great storyteller and hugely under-appreciated. Her books are always entertaining and deliver real chills.

It's been a long time since I read this classic horror novel, but it still haunts me to this day. A young family moves into a new home and become the target of an evil crone that preys on children and their nightmares. Hands down, this is one of the most horrific novels I've ever read. Gates pulls no punches here, so beware. It is unbelievably graphic. Not for the weak hearted but a must for horror fans!	2001-06-14

Something more ominous than any blizzard. An old circus train rolls in on railroad tracks that haven't been used in nearly a century. And inside the train are vengeful phantoms that want the town to pay in blood for a forgotten sin. Ryan's novel has all the elements of a classic horror novel. In a simple, but compelling writing style, he delivers one of the creepiest and most entertaining horror novels I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Highly recommended...especially for a cold winter's night!	2001-06-14

At least four of his books occupy my top ten list of best books of all time and he deserves every bit of the success he's garnered. DREAMCATCHER is one of the fastest moving books he's ever done. It is a gruesome tale of aliens among us and the military's take-no-prisoners response to them. But it is also the story of a friendship between a group of men and a boy with Down's Syndrome and their unique psychic bond. King pulls out all the stops with this book and along with his usual depth of character it is one of the most action packed books he's ever done. An exciting, and harrowing blend of sci fi and horror. Highly recommended.	2001-06-13

I'm not a huge fan of court-room dramas and after reading Grisham's enjoyable THE FIRM years ago, I always assumed that the rest of his novels were more of the same. (In part because of the legal sounding titles.) TESTAMENT is more than that, however, and opened my eyes a bit. The story of a dying mogul and his greedy offspring was very entertaining and very suspenseful. I couldn't wait to see the reprehensible heirs get bamboozled with the will. The protagonist is a washed up alcoholic lawyer who must find the true-- and secret-- heir who is a missionary in South America. He finds a beautiful and self-less woman that forces him to confront his own self absorbed, tortured existance. Entertaining, humorous, and thought provoking.

But Jensen is a good storyteller and she delivers the goods when it comes to horror. LOST AND FOUND is one of her best. It is the story of a kind of wraith from a woman's past, and it is one of the creepiest books I've read in a long while. Highly recommended if you enjoy great creepy fun.

And God help anyone who criticizes him or disagrees with him. He's infamous for his infantile rants and insults on the web. (As in the below review, posted anonymously, but obviously him.) &quot;Some people don't get this book...&quot; he claims. As though the story and it's theme were &quot;above&quot; some readers. Perhaps he did a crappy job of telling the story and conveying that theme? The book speaks for itself, regardless of it's inclusion in so- called &quot;Best of&quot; lists and claims by the author. Wright has a good imagination and conveys a great sense of atmosphere in his work, he just doesn't know how to deliver the goods.

Having read DREAMTHORP, SOULSTORM, and ASH WEDNESDAY, I consider myself a fan of his. So when I started his SEARCHERS trilogy and found CITY OF IRON to be a bit uneven, I decided to forge ahead. And I'm glad I did. (See my reviews for book two and three.) In this first entry, we are introduced to the three lead characters, all operatives for a covert assignment, investigating paranormal activity. It becomes apparent to the agents that there are other reasons behind their assignment and when they catch wind of a mysterious man referred to as The Prisoner and The One Who Does Not Die, the pace really picks up, for both the characters and the reader.

And three different groups, including a religious madman with lots of money and power, are racing towards his holding cell in the Arizona desert. Some want to free him of his chains, others want to kill him. But the Prisoner is more powerful than any of them are prepared for... After a wobbly start, EMPIRE OF DUST, redeems the series. I'm turning the pages of book three as fast as I can to find out hwo the world will be saved from The One Who Does Not Die. (Look for my review of the conclusion.)	2001-05-11

I read it in two days and was a nervous wreck the whole time. Women begin disappearing in Chapel Hill, NC, to the horror of the locals and authorities. When Alex Cross' own neice becomes one of the missing, he hot-tails it to NC to try and find her and solve the mystery. It becomes apparent that it is the work of a serial killer who may be keeping the girls prisoners. And if that wasn't horrifying enough, there appears to be a relationship between the man who calls himself &quot;Casanova&quot; and another serial killer operating on the west coast. A fantastic thriller from an amazing author. Alex Cross has become one of my favorite fictional heroes. Highest recommendation.	2001-05-10

But as a long time fan of his work, DARKLINGS has always been my favorite novel. It's the story of a parasite that slithers from a serial killer's body and wreaks havoc in a hospital and small town. The parasite unleashes monstrous behavior in it's victims, making for some of the most ghoulish scenes in horror history. The tension builds and builds as the protagonists track down the creatures horrific origin and the climax is one of the creepiest I've ever read... In a less talented author's hands, this storyline could have failed and seemed hokey, but Garton handles it with expert skill and wild enthusiasm. (Also, keep in mind, this was written before-- and quite possibly was the inspiration for-- movies such as THE HIDDEN, that came along later.) DARKLINGS was also written during the golden years of horror, back when authors worked hard to scare readers and had fun with their work. There was none of today's pretentious crap, where content and story take a backseat to &quot;style&quot; and the same old themes are beaten like a dead horse. Back then horror novels were designed first and foremost to entertain and scare the hell out of readers. DARKLINGS is a perfect example of that. Do yourself a favor and find this book. If you're a horror fan, your collection has a big gaping hole in it until you own a copy of this book! (And by the way, please disregard the previous reviewer. Garton's DARKLINGS has never been made into a movie nor does it go on &quot;too long&quot;. The reviewer has obviously confused Garton's book with something else...)	2001-04-28

Although this book is #4 in the Alex Cross series, it was my first introduction to James Patterson. And I must say, I was truley blown away by it. Patterson's crisp, economic writing style moves with a speed unlike any other author I have read. Opening the first page of this book was like jumping into a moving car. His storytelling absolutely burns up the page. If you want an edge-of-your-seat thriller with twists and turns that keep you turning the pages, Patterson is your man. And as an aside, it's a real delight to have an African American as a protagonist for a change. Too often they are assigned &quot;buddy&quot; roles or supporting cast type stuff.	2001-04-26

Little does he know, the house is more than just an architectural oddity. It has power. And it feeds on nightmares. God help the neighboring town when it does. This is a great read for horror fans. Borton pulls out the stops on this one and unleashes a horde of wild terrors. Highly recommended.	2001-04-26

From his first book, a horror novel called THE BLACK MARIAH, to his subsequent thrillers, I've watched a good writer approaching greatness. THE SLEEP POLICE is not his best work, I'm sorry to say, but it is a good read and I would recommended reading it. A detective investigates a series of brutal murders, known as &quot;thumbsuckers&quot; because the way the victims are positioned after death, but he comes up against a brick wall as he delves into the case. Strange messages appear and periods of black outs and fugues lead him to believe he himself may be the killer. Then things really heat up. Bonansinga kind of overplays his hand a bit here, which is surprising for such a small book. Towards the end it got so relentless and incredible, it sort of stretched believability for me. But it is a neat idea, and a fast moving thriller. Keep your eye on this author. He's one to watch.	2001-04-26

He approaches like a storm and begins to slaughter the residents of the community one by one. Is it revenge? A curse? Is he human? The survivors race for their lives and try to solve the mystery behind the man known only as Kane... Douglas Borton is one of the best writers out there (he's currently doing crime thrillers under a psuedonym). If you see his name on a book, you're guaranteed a great story.

There's something monstrous and evil feeding on humans and stealing their very shadows in the process. It is ancient and it takes great pleasure from the fear of its prey. One young boy loses his parents and nearly his own life to it, before the creature senses something dangerous about the boy and flees with a promise to return. No one believes the boy, of course, except for one man. He is a fugitive from the law and a hunter of the ancient beast. He is so obsessed with killing the monster he is willing to sacrifice the child to do it... Creepy, fast-moving, and skillfully done. Highly recommended for horror fans.	2001-04-25

I've been a fan of Costello's for a long time and have watched him improve with each novel. I love it when an author I like comes out with a big fat horror novel, and I got my wish with this book. An underwater expedition exploring life around volcanic vents in the ocean floor, find a freakish colony of large worms. When one is brought up to the surface with a remote controlled vehicle, all hell breaks loose. The worms seize the minds and souls of all who come in contact with them and spread exponentially. There's a weird subplot about a cult of people who welcome the invasion of the wurms and become a kind of conduit for some dark gods or something. And truthfully, it clouded the plot a bit. But aside from that, this is a great ride and a helluva book for horror fans. I give it 4 1/2 stars and eagerly await more from this great author.	2001-04-25

I've been reading Golden's work for a while now, (SAINTS AND SHADOWS, STRANGEWOOD, to name a few) and I've found him to be an author you can trust for great storytelling, crisp writing, and good, creepy entertainment. PROWLERS is the first of a planned series about monsters among us and a great opener. The Prowlers of the title are an ancient breed of werewolf-like creatures that do not change with the moon, but cloak themselves in human skin and change at will. They have walked among us for centuries and hunted humans. A powerful new leader is bringing the scattered packs together and making them more dangerous and organized. A young man, Jack Dwyer, stumbles across their shadowy existence when his best friend is slaughtered by several members of the pack. Jack, who has been forced to mature beyond his years due to personal tragedies, becomes the greatest enemy the pack has ever known. Strongly recommended.	2001-04-25

I just don't have the attention span for it and there's always some chore I'm neglecting when I kick back to read. But occassionally I pick up a book and absolutely cannot tear myself away from it. Harper's MORTAL PURSUIT is one of those books. I was familiar with this author's work already and had enjoyed everyone I'd read. This book, however, blew me away. It follows a female cop through a harrowing night of terror as she stumbles across a hostage situation at a remote mansion and things go horribly wrong. One of the most relentless and entertaining thrillers I've read in a great while. If you're looking for crisp, fast paced writing, do yourself a favor and pick this book up. Harper knows what he's doing and he does it better than the majority of writers out there.	2001-04-21

Over the course of the past couple of years I've hunted down all of his books, most of which are out of print now. SHUDDER was the last on my list and I was delighted to find it in a used bookstore recently. Like his other books, I found myself immediately captivated and carried it with me everywhere I went for three days, reading every chance I got; at lunch, in traffic, on breaks at work. SHUDDER is a disturbing tale of a killer's ghoulish hate for the &quot;ordinary&quot; and psychotic quest for &quot;art&quot;. The target of this diseased mind is what society holds most sacred: children. Detective Robert Card goes on the hunt for the killer and finds himself-- and his own son-- entangled in the murderer's web. You'll be gasping out loud at this book, holding on to it like the safety bar on a rollercoaster. Full of twists and turns and brilliant suspense. Highly recommended.	2001-04-21

They both share an apocalyptic landscape and an Evil entity's attempt to take the throne of humanity in the aftermath. But McCammon's fiery imagination and heart sets this one apart from King in many, many ways. A bit more fantastic (as in &quot;fantasy&quot;) than King's work, this is McCammon's own, unique and brilliant epic. A story that horrifies and moves you at the same time. It is one of the great classic horror novels of all time.	2001-04-02

What can I possibly say about this book that 500+ reviewers haven't already said? Only that I have had more dreams about it than any other book I've ever read. It is an amazing experience, so expertly drawn, you'll feel as though you have walked through those empty, graveyard cities and down those endless, lonely highways, desperately looking for the last of humanity. Brilliant, moving, and awesome. Don't let the size of this book keep you from reading it. You'll never forget it once you do, I guarantee it.	2001-04-02

GREELY'S COVE stands out as one of the most gruesome and harrowing horror novels I've read. A young boy is miraculously &quot;cured&quot; of his autism by a strange psychiatrist in the small town of Greely's Cove. Things are not as they seem, however, and bizarre things begin to happen in the town. People vanish, the dead come back to visit the living, and something unbelievably grotesque and evil tries to break through from the Otherside with the help of an evil warlock. Gideon really pushes the envelope in this book. There are scenes that will have you gasping out loud while you read, they are so vile.

I was already a fan of this author's work (see my reviews of NIGHTSCAPE and DARK REUNION) when I picked this book up. But after I read BLOODY VALENTINE, I went on a wild search to find all of his books. A group of college students participate in an experiment to profile an imaginary serial killer. No detail is spared and when it's over, they have what is almost a living and breathing person on paper. Unfortunately, this &quot;imaginary&quot; killer doesn't want to stay in the confines of the role playing experiment. When people begin to die in circumstances that match the modus operandi of the invented killer, the experiment is called off. Years later, however, it looks as though the killer wants to come back and play, seeming to materialize from the very darkness of the participants' imagination. It will take all of them to stop him, to try and understand exactly what he is, but the killer has plans of his own and time is running out. As usual, Mr. George executes this idea with great skill and enthusiasm. It's one of his best, and a must have for people who love suspense and horror.	2001-03-03

I had tried to read another Ed Lee book, CREEKERS, and couldn't get past the first couple of chapters before I threw it down. Maybe it was the cover. It shows a screaming creature and a figure carrying a body through a cemetery. If nothing else I hoped it might be fun in a drive-in, b-movie kind of way. After all, I love horror novels--even the cheesy ones if they are fun. Well, GHOULS isn't even good in a bad way. It was just awful. Hopelessly juvenille, mysogonistic, pointlessly gory, and full of characters that talk like they are on some grade school playground. And to make matters worse, it's 444 freakin' pages. Don't waste your time. You'll end up like me: pissed off and feeling cheated.	2001-03-02

After an accidental shooting, a cop tries to piece his life back together by moving his family out of the city and back to his hometown. Things are not as they seem, however, and the towns people have a bizarre secret about their heritage and some dark force in the woods. Mr. George's love for the genre and his storytelling ability really shines in this one. I've picked it up several times since the first time I read it and the prologue is so captivating and neat, I find myself pulled into it all over again. Great fun and a great read.	2001-03-02

I'm always singing the praises of Stephen George to anybody who will listen and NIGHTSCAPE is one of my favorite books from this hugely under-appreciated author. A young boy, reunited with his mother after many years, is pursued by a bizarre cult. The boy and his mother, along with a tortured man who is out for revenge for the cult's murder of his brother, find themselves at odds with the mysterious group that seem to be everywhere. The closer they get, the less human the cult appears to be, and the young boy starts to go through a bizarre transformation as he is seduced by it's members. This is a startlingly original, wildly suspenseful book, and a great introduction to Mr. George's work. If you appreciate horror with a fantastic edge, do yourself a favor and seek this book out. You'll be glad you did. And just like me, you'll find yourself hunting down the rest of his work after you do.	2001-03-02

It had a ridiculously cheezy cover of a skeleton standing at a chalkboard. I cracked the cover expecting the worst and was very pleasantly surprised to find it was great creepy fun. I've since read it a second time and enjoyed it just as much. LIFEBLOOD was my next Duigon novel and I really enjoyed it. It's a very clever vampire novel with one of the creepiest, most original endings I think I've ever read. To anyone who likes horror, I highly recommend you seek him out. My only criticism is that Duigon went &quot;missing in action&quot;. I really thought he had a great career ahead of him but he vanished from the scene. Where are you Mr. Duigon?

The latter is the best of the two, (in my opinion,) and a really entertaining horror novel. In the tradition of King's 'SALEM'S LOT, a young man returns to his hometown to try and piece together the forgotten horrors of his childhood. During the process a lair of vampire-like demons are unleashed from a remote cave and the town is infected one by one.

I'm glad I did. It just reinforces my admiration for the man. King does not construct hokey haunted houses with his fiction. People looking for ghosts (on fishing wire) to come swinging through the dark or skeletons to jump out of closets on page 5 might be dissapointed. King writes realistic horror. I would swear that if the events of this book were possible, they would happen in just this way and the people involved would react exactly as they do here. King's greatest talent is making the horrific and the impossible seem so believable. And it's in that context that his work is so damn scary. To anyone who hasn't read this, I implore you to do so. As King mentions in the introduction, it's a bit dated. The book was written in the early 70's, but it still resonates powerfully today. As far as I'm concerned, this is the last &quot;real&quot; vampire book. Forget about Anne Rice's tortured woe-is-me &quot;sissy vampires&quot;. This is the vampire as it should be: grotesque, inhuman, and inherently evil.	2001-02-28

I hadn't heard of the author before and although I love horror fiction, the subject of witchcraft has never interested me all that much. If nothing else, I was just hoping for a fun b-movie kind of horror novel. Well, I got much more than I bargained for, let me tell you. WITCHCRAFT is a great ride and demented as hell. A man joins forces with a good witch to battle a dark coven that want to take over the world and unleash the powers of darkness. And they will stop at nothing to get what they want. And that includes some of the most gruesome and perverted stuff I've ever read. Seek this book out if you like your horror action packed, twisted, and full of wild supernatural forces.

I hate to think any horror fans out there missed it. YELLOW MOON is one of the weirdest and creepiest books to come along in a great while. (And I read every horror novel I can get my hands on.) Tunnels begin to appear out of nowhere in a small town like portals to another dimension. Several people, including a group of children wander into the tunnels and find themselves in what can only be described as the devil's playground, while the local citizens try to understand what's going on.

It really is an exceptional horror novel on many levels. The plot borrows from Matheson's Hell House and Jackson's Haunting of Hill House, but Williamson brings lots of interesting ideas to the table and does an outstanding job with it. A group of characters are offered large sums of money to spend a month in a mansion in PA that is rumored to be haunted. It is indeed and the entity that lives there is as evil as they get. The characters are interesting and believable, the scares are fresh and inventive, and the story moves quickly. By now, this book is kind of hard to find, but if you enjoy good writing and good horror, then track it down. It's well worth it.	2001-02-21

Not only because he's a fellow Tennessean but because his work is just so damn fun. Kelly is a natural storyteller, with a nice southern flair, and he always delivers entertaining horror. FEAR is no exception and he really pulls out all the stops with this one. It's just after WWII in the small town of Pikesville, TN and young Jeb Sweeny finds himself on the edge of personal tragedy and a greater evil that is devouring livestock and abducting children in the night. It's up to him, his handicapped war veteran father, and an old blues player Roscoe Ledbetter to save the town and find some kind of salvation. And if the bloodthirsty creature roaming Pikesville wasn't enough, they face even greater horrors when they venture into Fear County to seek help from a local legend known as The Granny Woman. Not only is this book full of dark adventure, but it's got a lot of heart. You'll find yourself cheering Jeb Sweeny on until the very end. A fun read and a great book. The only question I had when I turned the last page was: when's your next novel, Mr. Kelly?	2001-01-28

There's nothing wrong with Piccirilli's imagination. He brings all sorts of interesting and neat ideas to the table when he writes, but his prose and narration are a REAL obstacle for me. I don't know if it's an attempt to be &quot;literary&quot; or what, but I find it to be very convoluted and difficult to follow. It just kills the story for me, I'm sorry. Kinda like watching a good movie with a whole lotta static. It's too difficult for me to see beyond it. I wish him all the best, though. A lot of people really seem to like him...	2001-01-15
US	53049759	R22ZRWJYFT5SVK	0451400801	301496492	In Darkness Waiting	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Real fear	I have a voracious appetite for horror novels (as my wall of books will attest to,) and I can honestly say, out of the hundreds that I've read, this is one of the creepiest books ever. Few horror novels really get to me (most of them are just fun thrill rides through the dark,) but this one gave me the honest to God heebie-jeebies. The doctor's &quot;Lord of Dark Corners&quot; in the attic freaked me out. Do yourself a favor and track this book down.	2001-01-13
US	53049759	R1TY3Y1RZMA62J	0843947462	410907005	The House That Jack Built	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Singing the praises of Masterton	I've been a fan of Masterton's for many years (every since I read his incredible horror novel &quot;Mirror&quot;) and consider him one of the absolute masters of the genre. &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; is another outstanding contribution and a great read. A young couple decide to refurbish a huge mansion and in the tradition of King's The Shining, the protagonist's husband is drawn into it's dark history where a great evil seems to have transcended the very fabric of time. Fast moving, full of dark details, believable and smart characters, I highly recommend horror fans seek this book out. I also recommend the aforementioned &quot;Mirror&quot;, along with &quot;Walkers&quot;, and &quot;Manitou&quot;.	2001-01-06
US	53049759	RM57BVSKCTR1N	0440214564	190709201	Harrowgate	Books	4	1	1	N	N	find this book	Harrowgate is a dark, mesmerizing ride into an almost Lovecraftian labyrinth. A painter gets involved with a woman who is apparently very dead and is pulled into a bizarre, Hellraiser-like group of dark gods. I highly recommend this book to all horror fans. It has all the elements of a good story and is one of the real standouts from the short lived Abyss line. Unfortunately, just when Gower seemed to walk out onto the stage with two very strong books, he vanished. Where are you Mr. Gower? The genre needs you!	2000-12-26

There is nothing more satisfying than wading into a big thick book that is expertly crafted and perfectly designed for entertainment and escapism. Lincoln and Child are a helluva team and this book, along with RELIC, does not disappoint. These guys know what they are doing and they do it very well. With just enough research to make the incredible credible, they have crafted a dark thrill ride that straddles the fence between suspense and horror. This book reads like a blockbuster and it's a wonder it hasn't made it to the big screen yet. This is a definite 5 star novel.	2000-12-09
US	53049759	R3ESJ05Y4CHM57	1558171371	365359185	Schoolhouse	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Pure horror fun!	This novel is a real jewel among all the cheezy horror novels of the late 80's and early 90's. (Back when nearly all of them had covers with skeleton faced children and holograms that turned into monsters and skulls.) It doesn't try to be anything more than a fun, creepy horror novel and the author does an outstanding job with it. The plot involves a kind of entity that bores into the very wood of a middle school. The entity feeds on the energy of those who walk its corridors and this supernatural feeding process seems to distort the fabric of our reality. It unleashes ghosts of the past, alien phantasms that slither from faucets and holes in the walls, and vine-like tentacles that snare it's victims... If you can get your hands on this paperback, do yourself a favor and snatch it up. It's a late-night/creature feature kind of book but it's very satisfying and entertaining, especially for horror fans. Kudos to Duigon for a great ride. And who doesn't think old schools are creepy anyway?	2000-10-27
US	53049759	R2L7MKBIQ04GQT	0786012595	970499077	Nightlife	Books	5	10	12	N	N	One helluva book.	Vampire fiction has become so popular that it's really it's own sub genre of horror fiction. Just take a look at any horror shelf at your local bookstore and calculate the ratio of vampire fiction to other tales. But few manage to breath new life into this theme and write a fun and scary book in the process. Jack Ellis (aka Stephen R. George, author of 13 previous novels,) manages to do just that. And man, what a book. Nightlife is a brilliant variation on the vampire theme. You've never come across a vampire quite like this, I assure you. And most importantly, it's an absolute nail-biter of a horror novel.  Ellis/George has a keen understanding of the genre and what readers want from a horror novel, without ever being formulaic or cliched.  He has fun when he writes (you can just tell!) and all of his novels are like carefully constructed and expertly paced rollercoaster rides.  Do yourself a favor and pick this book up. Hell, buy two of them. You'll end up passing around a copy to your friends and you just might not get one back! (Well, that's what happened to me at least.)	2000-10-08
US	53049759	RIAXMOCPKDII4	0446352047	945678977	Winter Wake	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A really fun, creepy read	I've slammed Hautala in the past for some of his other work but Winter Wake was a really satisfying read. I've read it twice now and I enjoyed it both times. An average American family moves home to a small town in Maine  to take care of an elderly relative. They soon find they are being stalked  by a kind of wraith that seems to be related to a dark secret from  someone's past. Hautala has fun with the idea and it really comes across.  There's a lot of genuinely creepy elements to the story (even in the  background,) and it makes for a great read. Find it. Read it. Enjoy it. I  may even read it again.	2000-07-31

I rarely read novels in a single day but this book was so engaging and entertaining I read it in a single sitting. It has  everything a good horror novel should have. Chills, thrills, a neat plot,  and likeable, smart characters. Highly recommended. When are you going to  write a new book, Mr. Citro? Don't leave us hanging any longer!	2000-07-31
US	53049759	RGWOQB0X1NFW2	155773660X	73626497	Darkborn	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Great contribution to the horror genre	I recently reread this gem and I appreciated it even more the second time around. A group of young school boys steal an old book on the occult and decide to perform one of it's demonic rituals just for kicks. It appears to be a failure and nothing more than a silly game until years later when the participants begin to die in gruesome ways and it becomes apparent that a demonic force was unleashed. One man must stop the horror and send the Adversary back to hell, risking his own existence in the process. The plot unravels a little slowly at first, but it's very suspenseful, and it really picks up half way through. The last hundred pages or so move like a wild amusement park ride. Costello wraps the story up in a very clever way that I found really satisfying and neat. (Something that's difficult for the most experienced and popular writers to pull off.) This book is well worth looking for as are all of his books. When's the next horror novel, Mr. Costello? We want more!	2000-07-29
US	53049759	R2ADVAZEV2LTDT	0451198786	266969050	Darker Than Night	Books	4	13	18	N	N	Another great effort from Goingback	I was delighted when I came across this latest effort from Owl Goingback for two reasons: One, there was something new on the horror shelf besides King and Koontz reprints. And two, I was intrigued to see how Mr. Goingback  had matured after his first novel, Crota. (Which I found very entertaining  and would recommend, although I wouldn't call it startlingly original.)  I'm very happy to report that Darker Than Night is even more entertaining  and engaging, (I read the first three chapters before I even drove out of  the bookstore parkinglot!) and it further illustrates the talent of this  promising author.  It's kind of heavy on the cliches, (including the  obligatory crazy old man in town that actually isn't crazy but knows the  shocking truth behind the horrors) But it has some genuine chills and  thrills to it and the ending is a slam-bang nailbiter.  One thing I found  distracting with this book, however-- so much so that I actually put it  down for awhile-- was a dialogue on anti-gun control measures. Normally I  would overlook this kind of thing (and politely agree to disagree,) but  this was like a PSA from the president of the NRA, Charlton Heston,  interrupting a good movie. It even included a Limbaugh-esque  finger-pointing at them damn liberals and feminists who were making it so  dad-blamed hard for all those hard working Americans to buy a gun. What  would our poor forefathers think about this sad state of affairs after  writing the right to bear arms into our Constitution? (They'd be holding  onto their wigs and running for cover in the freakin'cross-fire, is what  they'd be doing.)	1999-12-13
