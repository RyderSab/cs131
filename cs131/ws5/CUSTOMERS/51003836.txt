This is a book about Georgia and her adventures. The only problem I had with this book was snotty attitude of Georgia. She was/is one of those people that I choose to avoid for my selection of friends. I think the most hilarious part was the part where she declared she would never eat another potato chip again.	2002-05-24

Witchcraft is about balance. Not all dark and not all light. This book isnt about balance it is about what Christians think of witches. It is also about Satan and Lucifer,etc. The spells in here and nasty,come one eating a spider for strength. You want physical strength exercise. Know yes the old witches did curse,but they cursed when someone was a threat to them or their own,not just because someone looked at them wrong. So grow up.	2001-02-12

That chapter is about witchcraft being of the 'devil',though we know thats not true.	2001-02-09

I have the other 2 books already. This one deals with love hence the name. Well some of these spells in here do against the rede,which is fine for me since I am not Wiccan.

Perhaps what I liked about it was the fact that she admitted not all witches were wiccan and not all wiccans were witches. Then came in the mistakes like the destiny number being your name number,no your destiny number is when you add your year,month and day you were born together. When she talked about the 3 levels of angels,that depends on which angels you work with. She was refering to the catholic ones,but they have Nine Choirs. Were she gave some of the signs two planets,when some were only supposed to have one. This book was filled with fluff.	2001-01-30

Instead lets learn to accept each other's differences.  What really got me mad about this book,is that she said that woman shouldnt have sex anymore. [...].

Another part that irked me was the fact that he put the pentagram only with christian mythology and there are alot of religions that use the pentagram,christians wont even touch it now.
