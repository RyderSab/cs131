The first book was a masterpiece of its kind, and those who have not read it should do so before reading &quot;Harlequin&quot;.  <br />After getting the story off to a cracking start in &quot;Draco&quot;, Ian Watson continues at a steady pace.  The events of the book, especially his encounter with the Hydra plot, have shaken Inquisitor Draco's worldview to the core.  Now, adrift in a universe of chaos and uncertainty, he sets out with his companions in search of answers and explanations.  What he finds are more questions, complications, and enigmas than he ever thought possible.  <br />It seems that the Inquisition, sworn to keep watch over all of humanity, has declared war on itself.  Although utterly loyal to the Imperium in theory, Inquisitors are developing their own mysterious agendas-- agendas which may place the entire universe at risk.  The ancient Eldar, a race on the brink of extinction, exert their enigmatic alien intellects in an effort to bend the factions of humanity towards their own mysterious ends.  In the depths of warpspace, mighty spiritual entities gather their strength.<br />In this time of crisis and change, Draco must strive to find his own role in the course of events.  For it is clear that he has a part to play, whether he wants to or not.  What he discovers, and what he must do, carry both his party and his readers into the most mysterious reaches of the Warhammer 40,000 setting.  The human race, and the entire universe, are headed into an epoch of unprecedented cataclysm, from which they will emerge into a new era of greatness-- if they are not destroyed forever.        <br />Draco and his companions continue to interact with their surroundings and with eachother in fascinating ways.  As more and more of their most basic assumptions disappear into uncertainty, the characters find themselves moving closer and closer to the breaking point.  Can they achieve their objectives, or at least find meaningful answers, before they are all driven insane?  <br />Ian Watson's powerful, energetic writing style continues unabated in this book.  Strange settings and stranger events zoom by at a rapid pace, but they never seem gratuitous.  Everything that happens contributes to a satisfying, if unsettling, whole.<br />IN RESPONSE TO THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER (The one from &quot;Overthere&quot;): At first glance, it's true that some of the events of this book seem implausible based on what we know of the Warhammer 40,000 universe.  However, there is one MAJOR fact that you must remember: Draco is acting under some form of divine guidance.  The exact nature of his supernatural benefactor may be open to question, but it clearly allows him to do things that would not otherwise be possible (this was clear even in the first book).	2003-01-02
US	49940939	R1V1DIJRVOG2IW	0743443187	682997292	Draco (Warhammer Novels)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Return of a classic	I first read this book (then called \\"Inquisitor\\") about nine years ago, when I was 11. I was (and am) fascinated with the Games Workshop's numerous gaming products, so I thought I'd give it a try. I loved it at the time, and after many years, many re-readings, and hundreds of other novels, it remains one of my favorite speculative fiction novels ever.<br />Many bizarre events occur in this novel, and it would be impossible to describe them all. It is set in the universe of Warhammer 40,000, probably the most successful science fiction wargame ever. It will particularly appeal to GW fans, but even those not familiar with the game should have no trouble reading it, as Ian Watson describes the setting in considerable detail.<br />The protagonist, Jaq Draco, is an agent of the galaxy-spanning Human Imperium. It is his job to root out all who would oppose the Emperor, an unspeakably ancient and powerful being who is both head of the Imperial government and god of the Imperial religion. Draco is trained to be absolutely ruthless in the destruction of his enemies, even if he must kill millions or billions of innocent people to achieve his goals. His job, already enormously stressful, becomes even more difficult when he stumbles across the Hydra plot. This massive conspiracy has enormous plans for the human race-- but whose side are they really on? In order to answer this question, Draco and his several companions travel all over the galaxy, from a hideously mutated world at the heart of Chaos to the legendary, grossly-overpopulated homeworld of Ancient Terra.<br />Along the way, Ian Watson manages to ask a surprising number of philosophical questions. In a time when humanity is surrounded by enemies and absolute evil is an everyday reality, is absolute tyranny justified? Can the zealous agent of such a tyranny rise above his station in life to become a true hero? In a society built upon intolerance and hate, is love even a possibility?<br />Such questions are there for those who wish to consider them, but they are by no means the only aspect of the novel. The story is one of adventure on a massive scale, covering just about every aspect of speculative fiction. For science fiction fans, there are spaceships, alien beings, and truly fascinating worlds. For fantasy lovers, there are magical powers and arcane secrets galore. For horror buffs, there are bizarre cults, hideous demonic entities, and brutal witch hunts. <br />This book works on every level. There are fascinating characters, terrific (and often terrifying) atmosphere, ethical conundra, and darn good adventure. Whether you're looking for post-modern morale ambiguity or just an enormously entertaining read, you can't go wrong with this one.<br />NOTE:This is the first book in a trilogy, books 2 and 3 of which are \\"Harlequin\\" and \\"Chaos Child.\\" By early next year, all will be back in print.	2002-09-03

Turtledove, long recognized as the Grand Master of Alternate History, has now firmly established himself as a fine crafter of off-beat fantasy extravaganzas, as well.  His sweeping, multi-volume &quot;Darkness&quot; epic retells World War II with a very bizarre twist: the world is not Earth, and magic takes the place of science.  Strange though this may sound, it has made for a very fascinating and entertaining series.  Military historians will enjoy looking for familiar places and events, while fantasy buffs will find plenty of interesting magical gadgets.  And, as long-time Turtledove fans have come to expect, there is a large and varied cast of characters, representing every nation and all walks of life.  From these myriad viewpoints, readers are treated to a full view of the war, in all its bloody detail.    <br />In this third volume, the struggle enters its critical phase.  Events are taking place that will have a major effect on the outcome of the conflict.  Algarve (Germany) gears up for a massive assault on Sulingen (Stalingrad).  If they can take this strategically-vital city, the material wealth of southern Unkerlant (Russia) will be theirs for the taking.  Meanwhile, down in the Land of the Ice People (North Africa), Lagoan (British) and Kuusaman (American) forces struggle to expell the Algarvians, with massive supplies of cinnabar at stake.  This valuable mineral allows dragons to shoot their fiery breaths much further, greatly increasing the air power of whoever posesses it.  And in Kuusamo itself, government-backed mages continue to plumb the deepest, darkest depths of magic theory.  The further their research progresses, the more astonishing- and terrifying- their findings become.  Although some are afraid to continue, no one wants to run the risk falling behind Algarve. <br />All of this is told with Turtledove's usual blend of action, humor, romance, and suspense.  And the horror of WWII is never far away: Algarve continues to sacrifice innocent Kaunians in a savage Holocaust, using their life energy to power deadly magical attacks.  Against this increasingly terrifying backdrop, the myriad viewpoint characters must fight just to stay alive.  In the conquered kingdom of Forthweg (Poland), Ealstan the bookkeeper struggles to keep his Kaunian lover hidden from the prying eyes of the Algarvians.  Far to the east, in Valmiera, Skarnu's guerrilla war with the occupying army places his life in increasing danger.  Trasone comes face to face with the sheer determination of King Swemmel's (Stalin's) soldiers as he fights for his life in the blasted streets of Sulingen.<br />If you've read the previous books, don't hesitate to buy this one.  A gripping and detailed flight of (dark) fantasy, it is a most enjoyable way to spend your leisure time.	2001-03-09

Ever since his first WorldWar book, Turtledove has kept SF fans around the world spellbound with his alternate historical epic of reactionary imperialist alien invaders and the cunning humans whose job it is to defeat them- or learn to live with them.  <br />It is now the 1960s, some twenty years since the first round of fighting came to an end.  The USA, the USSR, the Third Reich, and other developed nations remain independent, but Africa, Asia, South America, and Australia lie under the &quot;Lizard&quot; yoke.  As time passes, the new generation comes to take the aliens more and more for granted.  Both races work hard to adapt to the new world order.<br />But the aliens came to conquer the Earthlings, not to sign treaties with them.  The Earthlings, meanwhile, are struggling to fill in the technological gap, turning out increasingly effective instruments of war.  The United States reaches out into space, eager to take some of the &quot;high ground&quot; for themselves.  And what they do once they get there may well exceed the worst nightmares of either species.  <br />And yet, there may be some hope for peace.  Every year, the two races are forced to interact more and more.  Slowly but surely, inter-species friendships bloom.  Psychologists and sociologists from both sides struggle to understand eachother.  In many parts of the occupied world, humans come to coexest peacefully with their alien overlords.<br />Then, suddenly, everything changes.  With Sam Yeager's deadly secret revealed at last, the world is brought once again to the brink of war.  Even as Germans and Frenchmen struggle to hold their nations together, the rest of the world threatens to erupt.  Today, a war could bring only two possible outcomes: it will leave the whole world under the dominion of the Lizards, or render it useless to both races...<br />This final installment of the Colonization series is another five-star performance from the Master of Alternate History.  As events unfold at an increasingly rapid pace, Turtledove keeps the suspense rate admirably high.  As vast webs of violence, intrigue, and deceit spread to every corner of the civilized world, the reader is often left in doubt as to whether a character will live to see the next page.  <br />As in all of his best works, Turtledove manages to tie science, history, technology, romance, intrigue, action, and humor into a single, successful whole.  The year is still young, but this is likely to be my choice for best SF novel of 2001.	2001-02-03

A straight-to-paperback series little known outside the genre, its dedicated readers have come to recognize it as one of the most reliable sources of enjoyment to be found anywhere.  It seems woven from the very fabric of the American spirit: a shipload of Civil War-era Yankees is accidentally teleported to a far-off world, a world where human beings are nothing more than cattle.  The Yankees, unwilling to be led quietly to the slaughter, use their knowledge of gunpowder and steam propulsion to launch a local resistance movement against the flesh-eating alien overlords.  Once the local humans have tasted freedom, there is no turning back.  What started out as a local revolt quickly turns into a full-scale war of liberation, as the republican ideal sweeps the world.  The tale apparently ended in &quot;Men of War&quot; (Book 8) with the final defeat of the brutal but cunning Bantag horde.<br />But now they're back!  Forstchen, apparently unwilling to part with his masterwork, has come back for another round.  And it's worth it.  Far from a contrived sequel, this one is just as satisfying as the original series.  It has now been twenty years since the Great War ended.  The remainders of the Bantag horde are confined to a reservation, the few survivors of the Merki and Tugar scattered.  The Republic, its ranks bolstered by the additions of Nippon, Chin, and other new states, has prospered like never before.  Under the able presidency of unsurpassed war hero Andrew Keane, its merchants and soldiers roam the lands and seas in their increasingly sophisticated airpcraft and steamships.  It seems only a matter of time before all the humans of the world are united in the common dream of liberty and equality.         <br />But trouble is brewing.  Across the vast Southern Sea, a new menace is stirring: the Kazan.  Untouched by the Yankee-led revolution in the distant north, this mighty horde continues to lord it over the local humans, selectively bred and trained to make the perfect slaves.  Hazin, a clever and ruthless high priest, skillfully intervenes in a bloody civil war, bringing about the complete unification of the Kazan Empire.  He recognizes the threat posed by the Republic, and, armed with warships and airplanes larger and more powerful than anything in the Yankee arsenal, plans to squelch it once and for all.<br />With little time to prepare, President Keane, Senator O'Donald, and the other survivors of the Lost Regiment are faced with their greatest challenge yet.  But it is their children, now of fighting age, who will bear the brunt of the terror.  Even as events are coming to a head in the Kazan Empire, Andrew Keane's son, Abraham, accompanies legendary general Vincent Hawthorne to the reservation, where the Bantag grow increasingly restless.  Their food nearly gone, their ancient way of life totally annihilated, these bitter survivors dream of taking back their former glory.  And now, with events moving towards an inevitable global war, their chance seems to have arrived.  <br />As the Republic braces itself for trouble, its scientists and engineers struggle to develop the technologies necessary to meet the Kazan on their own terms.  It looks grim, but the Republic is not a nation of quitters.  Far from surrender, their ready to prove that the free spirit truly is invincible.  <br />Every bit as powerful, moving, and compelling as the earlier books.  There is no higher compliment.	2000-12-15
US	49940939	R31HXQTUXA46W9	0441123899	428676731	Cry Republic	Books	4	32	32	N	N	Liberty or death!	This fine adventure story wraps up Kirk Mitchell's &quot;Procurator&quot; trilogy.  The first book (&quot;Procurator&quot;) introduced Germanicus Agricola, military governor of Anatolia, serving in the name of a Roman Empire that never fell.  In the next book, Germanicus travelled to the New World, to make war with the bellicose Aztec Empire, and their enigmatic Chinese allies.  Throughout his career, however, Germanicus had only one goal: the dismantling of the Empire, and the ultimate restoration of the legendary Republic.<br />Alas, the tradition-minded Empire has little room for idealists.  Germanicus, his plot detected before it can reach fruition, is forced to flee East in fear for his life.  Meanwhile, a cruel usurper seizes the Roman throne, determined to profit from the chaos.  A bloodthirsty and paranoid tyrant, he ruthlessly goes about the task of eliminating his rivals.  His main target, inevitably, is Germanicus...<br />Germanicus himself makes his way to Anatolia, in the desperate hope of finding allies, or, more probably, a peaceful death.  He finds more than he could have expected, however.  For in the East, away from the pagan heartland of the Empire, monotheism has survived through the milennia.  And now, both the Jews of Palestine and the Muslim-like Anatolians see something special in this _pasa_ from the West, something which may forever change the course of events, both temporal and spiritual.<br />This book, like the previous ones, provides a satisfying mixture of alternate history and theological fantasy.  The timeline is not particularly plausible (the Imperial structure has apparently survived almost completely unchanged for two thousand years), but the static and conservative empire, straining on the brink of a major technological revolution, makes a fascinating setting.  <br />An excellent concluding book.	2000-12-12

Perfect for curious book browsers	This book may not include everything you ever wanted to know about science fiction, but it definitely comes closer than any other work in existence.  Long-time fans will enjoy the extensive analytical and bibliographical material.  Beginners looking for a useful introduction to the genre are sure to find it here.<br />It's impossible to completely describe the contents within the space of a short review.  However, a summary should be enough to give a general impression.  There are (alphabetically-sorted) articles on all different aspects of the genre, from the cinema to the written word.<br />To start off, there are biographies on every major science fiction writer from the 19th century-1993, and almost all of the minor ones.  These biographies, although of varying quality, are almost all of considerable interest.  As well as listing all of the writer's major contributions to the genre, they often include analyses of the author's writing styles, including discussions of specific works.  Although readers may find themselves disagreeing with some of the contributors, it is nonetheless fascinating to read the opinions of other devotees.<br />Perhaps just as important, there are many articles on the various science fiction magazines and their editors.  Such articles are vital to any comprehensive discussion of the genre; after all science fiction started out in the magazines, and many fine stories are still published there.  These articles include detailed and interesting descriptions of the magazines' histories, including editors, major contributors, and high and low points of success.<br />In addition to written fiction, considerable attention is paid to science fiction movies.  There is little information on actors, directors, or screenwriters, but plenty about the movies themselves.  Most major science fiction films have their own individual entries, including information on plot, acting, production quality.  The authors always make clear whether or not they like each movie; their recommendations have led me to many good rentals!<br />Finally, there are many articles on the genre itself.  Much attention is given to the history of the genre, from it's embryonic period in the 19th century, to it's consolidation in the 1920s, to it's maturation in the '40s, right on up to the '90s.  There is also a great deal of information on specific subjects and items of terminology, from &quot;Aliens&quot; to &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; to &quot;Spindizzies&quot;.  <br />I can pick this Encyclopedia up any time, and be sure of finding something interesting.  It's a surefire winner for anyone interested in random fact-finding.  All SF fans, even if they're not &quot;browsing&quot; types, should still keep this tome on hand.  Any question concerning the genre is likely to have an answer somewhere between the front and back covers.	2000-12-09

The series is set in an alternate present where the Rome never fell, and where advanced technologies (automobiles, firearms, radio) coexist uneasily with an archaic imperial government.<br />In this intriguing second installment, the focus shifts to the Roman colonies in America.  Germanicus Agricola, the hero of book one, must help ward off a violent invasion from the power-hungry Aztec empire.  Thanks to Rome's technological edge, it should be a breeze.  <br />But things are never so simple.  The Aztecs, far from incompetent savages, have developed their own deadly style of warfare.  And thanks to covert but widespread support from the ancient and advanced Serican (Chinese) empire, they are ready to meet the Romans gun for gun and ship for ship.  Their gods relish human blood and human hearts above all else.  And their gods are hungry...<br />What Germanicus has on his hands is a bloody, demoralizing trench war.  No land is changing hands, and breakthrough seems impossible.  To this mess is added the usual problems associated with power.  Someone is after Germanicus' life, and it could be anyone.  Even among his friends, it is impossible to say who can be trusted.<br />This book adds a great deal to Mitchell's rich setting.  Roman politics remain tough and nasty.  The Aztecs, with their bloodthirsty rituals, are terrifying enemies.  Far from faceless villains, however, they are very much a part of the world, with a unique culture, a complex religion, and some sympathetic characters.  Along with the enigmatic, seldom-glimpsed Sericans, they add a very effective foreign flavor to the setting.           <br />A great addition to a great series.	2000-11-09

Bloodchillingly nasty and utterly efficient, they are seen by all as either the most terrifying or the most ludicrously implausible of villains.  But one thing is clear: the Draka are big business with an IngolfTech label.  <br />Stirling has asked many of his fellow writers to make their contributions to the Draka canon.  This anthology, which includes stories by such big-name authors as Harry Turtledove and David Drake, is the result.  And a worthwhile result it is, for every story is good in it's own right.  The first two tell, in bloody detail, how George Custer and Chinese Gordon help the Draka conquer Africa.  David Drake tells the tale of gritty, un-glorious military politics during the Eurasian War.  <br />Some of the most interesting stories, however, come later in the anthology.  Perhaps the best are those that deal with trans-dimensional travel.  This sub-genre may seem hopelessly tired, but these stories give it new life.  John Barnes, for instance, pits the hero of his Timeline Wars novels against the Draka.  In Anne Marie Talbott's &quot;A Walk in the Park&quot;, a woman from our timeline swears that those tall, inexplicably charismatic strangers she sees in the park are just like something out of an SF series she once read.<br />This is a good choice for any science fiction fan.  Fans of the Draka series will understand the background better, but everyone will appreciate the high quality of the writing.	2000-10-31

Some 40 years later, Pilate pardoned Joshua Bar Joseph (Jesus Christ).  Without a martyr figure, Christianity never leaves the ground.  Without the external menace of Germanic invaders and the internal menace of religious controversy, the Roman Empire continues to grow and prosper.<br />Now, in the present day, Roma presides over an enormous realm, stretching from the rugged land of Anatolia to the Novo Provinces across the Atlantic ocean.  Germanicus Agricola rules as Procurator in the Province of Anatolia (Turkey).  The job, although glorious, is far from easy.  Although Roman subjects in name, the fanatically religious natives remain fiercely independent in spirit.  And they are determined to drive the infidels from their country by any means necessary.  When physical violence fails, they turn to a deadly magical weapon: massing.  Using this deadly psychic power, they are capable of assassinating enemies from a great distance.<br />Even in the face of this deadly menace, Germanicus is determined to stand firm.  Backed by the firearms, automobiles, and wireless communications of the Roman military, and by his own diplomatic ability, he moves to prevent a savage holy war.  But the stakes are far higher than he could ever imagine.  For behind the savage belligerence of the Anatolians lies a far more sinister conspiracy, aimed straight at the heart of the Roman Empire.  Before Germanicus knows it, he is over his head in a complex web of unspeakable violence, powerful sorcery, and ancient theological secrets.<br />Mitchell's prose is somewhat inelegant, but his plot is highly compelling.  He makes liberal -and successful- use of both the fantastic and the alternate historical, creating a delightfully unique piece of speculative fiction.	2000-10-07

In the ongoing &quot;Darkness&quot; series,  he re-enacts World War II in a swords-and-sorcery fantasy setting, with  magic taking the place of technology.  In this enjoyable new novel  (apparently the beginning of another series), he gives the American Civil  War a similar treatment.<br />When Avram (Abe Lincoln) inherits the throne of  Detina, the aristocrats of the Northern Provinces fear that he will  emancipate the blond-haired serfs who work their plantations.  Unwilling to  take this risk, they declare themselves an independent nation under the  leadership of King Geoffrey (Jefferson Davis).  Full scale war ensues, as  Avram attempts to bring the rebel provinces back into his fold.  Both sides  organize large armies of crossbowmen, unicorn cavalry, mages, and  magically-enhanced artillery.<br />This background is briefly described in the  prologue.  The story proper begins several years into the war, as General  Guildenstern (Rosecrans) leads his troops against Thraxton the Braggart  (Paxton Bragg) and his force of Northern rebels in the province of Franklin  (Tennessee).  It is based on a campaign from the real Civil War, but even  non-history buffs should get the gist of it.<br />As in most of Turtledove's  novels, there is a large cast of characters, ranging from common soldiers  to generals.  Many are thinly-disguised analogues of real people, such as  Longstreet (here called &quot;Broadpath&quot;), and Nathan Bedford Forrest  (&quot;Ned of the Forest&quot;, in this case).  Figuring out who is who is  one of the funnest parts of the book.<br />It has other strong points, though.   The various military leaders are portrayed in detail, helping the readers  understand what makes both sides &quot;tick&quot;.  The logistal details  and combat scenes, although modified to fit the fantasy setting, give a  strong sense of the 1860s style of warfare.  For example, long columns of  magic carpets serve as railroads, quickly moving troopsand supplies from  one place to another.           <br />A detailed and action-packed read.  It's  particularly fun for military buffs, but also a good read for everyone  else.	2000-08-30

I have been a fan of the Games Workshop's Warhammer game setting for as  long as I can remember.  It combines many classic elements: swords and  sorcery, action-adventure, lovecraftian horror, steampunk, etc.  Despite  this, it transcends all cliches to become one of the most detailed,  atmospheric, and engrossing fantasy settings ever.  Two of its most famous  inhabitants are Gotrek, a mighty dwarven warrior who has vowed to die in  combat, and Felix, a human poet/swordsman who has vowed to accompany  him.<br />Ever since I began reading, these heroes have always been nearby:  Gotrek, axe hold high, striding effortlessly across the pages of army list  books, anthologies, and magazines, an invincible force, splitting the  skulls of goblins and giants like so many eggs.  And Felix, capable but  pensive, a dealer of death but a lover of life, reflecting poetically on  his precarious situation.  This destructive duo, the very essence of heroic  fantasy, graced the pages of many Warhammer short-story anthologies and  expansion-packs in their days.  No longer.  The expansion packs are  replaced by new expansion packs, the anthologies long out of print.<br />But  now...  THEY'RE BACK!!!  After long years of silence, William King  (flavor-text writer extraordinaire) has brought his legendary creations  back from the dead.  Most of the stories are reprints from past Warhammer  anthologies, but they still read very well.  King has found the perfect  balance in his writing.  The axes-and-sorcery action is second-to-none,  with terrifying monsters, spattered gore, and hairbreadth escapes galore.   But there's also plenty of depth, as Gotrek contemplates the lost heritage  of his once-great dwarven race and the enigma of his own past, and Felix  reflects on the horrors of death and the greater horrors of life.           For old (18 year-old) salts like me, there are also two brand-new stories.   Perhaps they're not quite as good as King's old works, but they still come  highlyrecommended.<br />Whether you're a long-time fan of Warhammer or just  looking for good fantasy, the buck stops here!	2000-08-15

The Great War series has been excellent, and this is undoubtedly the best  so far!  The pace of the action picks _way_ up, and doesn't slow down till  the end.  <br />I haven't reviewed the previous two books, so I'll start with  a few words about the series in general, for the benefit of those who  haven't read them.  It is set in the same world as Turtledove's earlier  (and highly recommended) &quot;How Few Remain&quot;.  In this world, the  Confederates won the battle of Antietam, and went on to secede from the  Union with help from Britain and France.  The first book (&quot;The Great  War: American Front&quot;) opens up in 1914 with the beginning of World War  I.  The war in Europe goes much as it did in real life, with Britain,  France, and Russia squaring off against Germany and Austro-Hungary.  At  this point, however, things get more complicated.  The CSA is quick to join  the war on the side of its old friends, Britain and France. The US is  equally quick to join the war on the side of its one European ally,  Germany.  The result is a bloody, grinding trench war along the  US-Confederate and US-Canadian borders, accompanied by battles between the  US and British Pacific fleets.  Like the real WWI, the result is slow,  gory, and not terribly decisive.  It is tense and well told, but not much  land changes hands.<br />In &quot;The Great War: Breakthroughs&quot;, this  changes very quickly.  What has long been a war of positions makes the slow  but inexorable transformation into a war of mobility.   <br />Throughout the  series, many new tactics and technologies have been introduced.  In this  volume, they really begin to pay off.  The result is some of the fastest,  most exciting military-SF action to be found this year.  Airplanes drop  increasingly deadly and accurate payloads of bombs, wreaking destruction on  both civilian and military targets.  The US and it's Latin American allies  launch an assault against vital supply lines in the Pacific, hoping tostarve Britain into submission.  Confederate submarines struggle to break  the US Navy through hit-and-run tactics.  Artillerymen concoct increasingly  nasty chemical weapons.  General George Armstrong Custer, long thought  useless, finally does some good with his innovative use of barrels (tanks).       <br />The result of all this: soldiers are no longer safe in their own  trenches, and war will never be the same again.  The viewpoint characters  must learn to live with this rapidly changing world.  As artillery shells  fall on Washington, DC, Nellie Semphroch quickly learns that obnoxious men  are no longer her biggest concern.  Gordon McSweeney, solidly religious but  thoroughly bloodthirsty, delivers the Fires of Heaven to the Confederate  heathens through the barrel of a flamethrower.  George Enos hunts  Confederate subs from the deck of the USS Ericsson.  Jake Featherston, a  stalwart Southern nationalist, turns his battery of howitzers on any who  would dare hinder the Confederate war effort.       The end result: one  whopper of a read!  The action never stops, and there's also a decent  supply of nasty politics.  Since book one, I've been anxiously awaiting the  conclusion.  The wait is almost up!  I won't give away the ending, but  suffice to say that the war is over by the end of the book (I won't say who  wins).  I guess book IV will deal with an alternate Treaty of Versailles,  which will surely make an interesting conclusion.  <br />I don't give books  five stars very often, but this one deserves it for sheer entertainment  power.	2000-08-08

FUN!	&lt;The following review applies to the whole WorldWar series&gt;  SF blockbuster meets alternate history!  It's 1942, and WWII is going strong.  Germany is fighting Russia and Britain, the USA is fighting Japan, and the  action has never been faster and more furious.  But it's about to  be.<br />Strange lights appear in the sky.  Radars in Britain detect a  mysterious new presence over Europe.  Impossibly fast aircraft begin  tearing the fighters and bombers of the world to shreds.  THE ALIENS HAVE  LANDED!<br />Suddenly, the beleaguered nations of Earth are faced by a more  powerful menace than ever before.  The newcomers attack all over the world,  armed with jet planes, helicopters, automatic rifles, and A-bombs.  The  Earthlings are taken aback, but they fight back with everything they have:  Panzer tanks, railroad guns, propellor planes, and anything that might  explode.  They're outclassed in almost every respect by their  technologically superior foes, but they soon discover one thing they have  which the aliens lack: creativity.  Earth's defenders employ every  guerrilla tactic in the book, while scientists struggle to perfect jet  engines and nuclear bombs.  They may be outclassed, but they have no  intention of giving up.<br />Meanwhile, the small, reptilian  &quot;lizards&quot; are also quite taken aback.  Their space probe, which  sent its report a mere eight centuries ago, led them to expect  spear-wielding savages.  Where did these tanks come from? Where did these  &quot;big uglies&quot; (as the aliens call humans throughout the series)  learn about powered flight?  How could so much happen in 800 years?  And  more to the point, how did the locals learn such dirty tactics?<br />This  series succeeds brilliantly as both military adventure and science fiction.   The aliens' military technology is about at the 1990s level: Abrams-like  tanks, F-15-like fighters, and so on.  The clash between superior lizard  technology and superior big ugly tactics leadsto some terrific combat  action.  <br />The lizards are a strangely endearing creation, several of whom  are viewpoint characters.  They are the ultimate high-tech innocents.   Although reactionary and expansionistic, they are not really evil; they  merely see themselves as spreading the word of Civilization to less  fortunate races.  Their society epitomizes order, law, and staticicity.   Faced by such psychotic, technologically advanced barbarians as these big  uglies, their world view is shattered.  How can they reconcile these  high-tech barbarians with their logical, rational mindset?<br />One of the  most exciting SF epics of recent years.	2000-07-27
US	49940939	R3VBVR31L0FXWI	0345380118	796710884	Departures	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Alternate History...  and everything else under the sun	Harry Turtledove's name has become almost synonymous with Alternate History.  Guns of the South is perhaps the most talked about AH novel of today.  Even historical SF novels by other authors sometimes have  Turtledove's blurbs on the cover.<br />In this highly readable anthology, the  Grand Master proves that he is perfectly capable of handling other types of  fiction.  Sure, it contains plenty of AH stories.  One particularly  interesting example (&quot;Counting Potsherds&quot;) involves a world in  which Persia conquered the Greek city-states, squelching out democracy.   Another (&quot;Islands in the Sea&quot;) tells of a lively and informative  debate between Chritian and Muslim theologians.  The title story,  &quot;Departures&quot;, is set in the Agent of Byzantium world, telling  about the life of St. Mohammed.<br />The non-AH stories, however, are perhaps  more interesting.  They reveal many sides of Turtledove that were not  apparent before.  There is everything from baseball stories (including the  tale of a batboy who turns into a bat) to Jewish-themed fiction (including  one amusing story which asks whether a genetically engineered cud-chewing  pig would be kosher) to fantasy (can a well-meaning werewolf escape a  midieval lynch mob?) to hard SF (humans and aliens mingle in a futuristic  bar).  The tone of the stories is also highly variable, ranging from the  dead serious (should humans become involved with the affairs of low-tech  aliens?) to the utterly silly (what happens when a confused time traveller  from the far future accidentally ends up in a 20th century office  building?).  These stories have practically nothing in common.  Some make  you think, some make you laugh, some just make you say &quot;huh?&quot;,  but all are very enjoyable.<br />A great choice for Turtledove fans  everywhere, and even those who don't enjoy his AH may want to give it a  try.	2000-07-25

Although most of the stories are fairly recent, there are also a few classics thrown into the mix.<br />The almost-inevitable Turtledove story is &quot;Must and  Shall&quot;.    Like many of his other works, this tells about the results  of an alternate American Civil War.  Abraham Lincoln is assassinated while  touring the front in 1864.  The North still wins, but Lincoln's successor  institutes a harsh, vengeful Reconstruction. In the 1940s, the Southern  States are still under military occupation, and full of resentment.   Surprisingly, this one of the least interesting stories in the book.  The  premise is good and the story is readable, but the plot is below  Turtledove's usual standards.<br />There is also a Robert Silverberg tale  (&quot;An Outpost of the Empire&quot;) in which the Roman Empire never  fell.  The protagonist, a Venetian woman of Byzantine descent, must come to  terms with her new Roman governor.  It is a decent love story with a good  sense of &quot;otherness&quot;, but nothing special as far as AH  goes.<br />Most of the stories, however, explore less conventional themes.    A. A. Attanasio's atmospheric &quot;Ink from the New Moon&quot; tells the  tale of an alternate 15th century in which North America has been  extensively colonized by Chinese religious outcasts.  The protagonist, in a  letter to his dead wife, tells of his encounter with three ships bearing  strange, bearded men.<br />In &quot;We Could do Worse&quot;, Gregory Benford  tells the chilling tale of a dystopian alternate USA ruled by Joseph  McCarthy and Richard Nixon.  <br />One of the strangest of the stories, and  one of the best, is &quot;The West is Red&quot;, by Greg Costikyan.  Due to  a slight difference in human nature, Communism turns out to be much more  effective than Capitalism.  As the Cold War draws to a close, Russia and  China have become the most prosperous countries in the world, while the  poverty-stricken US finally prepares to go Communist.  The fundamental  difference in the nature of the world also leads to some interesting and  unexpected changes in fields like computer science.  Very imaginative.  I'm  capitalist to the core, but I loved it all the same!     <br />&quot;How I  Lost the Second World War&quot;, by Gene Wolfe, makes a great closing  story.  The plot is too weird to describe, but suffice to say that it takes  place in an alternate version of the '30s, and involves Winston Churchill,  Adolf Hitler, Dwight Eisenhower, an automobile race, a strategic wargame,  and an early invention of the transistor.<br />The above is just a sample of  what this anthology has to author. There are many other fine stories by  many other fine authors.  All of them are well worth reading.  Go buy it  today!	2000-07-25

Unlike most works of AH it  tells the COMPLETE story of its parallel timeline, not just a few events.  Rather than a novel  covering the lives of a few specific characters, it is written in the form  of a history textbook (complete with charts, tables, footnotes, and a map)  telling the history of two whole nations, from founding to the present day  (the 1970s).  Though some might find the textbook format bland and boring,  the author's fascinating extrapolations were more than enough to keep me  hooked. <br />When I was younger, I always thought that fictional history was  much more interesting than real-life history.  I would spend hours reading  Role-Playing textbooks just to learn the history of fantasy worlds.  Even  now that I'm a big fan of real history, I've found that fictional history  still holds a special place in my heart.  I read this book in about five  days, whereas a &quot;real&quot; history text would probably take much  longer.<br />The story: Britain won the Battle of Saratoga, and the American  rebellion was crushed.  In order to prevent further resentment, the  Thirteen Colonies were combined with Canada to form the Confederation of  North America (CNA).  Although still part of the British Empire, this new  nation was granted an extensive degree self-government, and soon became a  major economic power.<br />Many of the former revolutionaries, however, were  not happy with this arrangement.  These men fled to Texas, where they  formed the independent nation of Jefferson.  After intervening in a local  squabble in Mexico, they arranged for Jefferson and Mexico to be united as  one nation, called the United States of Mexico (USM).  Although not as  stable as the CNA, this continent-spanning republic also became a major  player on the world stage.<br />For Want of a Nail tells the story of the CNA  and the USM in great detail.  Political and economic trends are discussed  in depth, including state-by-state descriptions of elections (both nations  develop variations of our familiar republican system).  There is also  abundant information on important personalities and technological  developments.  Although military history is not Sobel's strong point, there  were enough wars to keep me reading. Events in the rest of the world are  not covered in great detail, but there is enough information to give a  general idea of what is going on.<br />It might bore some, but serious lovers  of alternate history are in for a real treat.	2000-07-24

Heinrich Himmler, supported by the vast power of the SS, fills in the power  vaccuum and becomes the new Fuhrer.<br />Realizing that he needs a powerful  leader in charge of the Wehrmacht if Germany is to have any hope of  success, Himmler puts Rommell, seriously injured but sound of mind, back in  charge of the Western Front.  He also realizes the need to combat Allied  air superiority, and therefore authorizes the Me-262 to be used in an  anti-bomber capacity (Hitler had intended to use it for ground support).    <br />What next?  Time to drive the Allies out of Normandy, of course! During  the ensuing campaign, both Patton and Rommell make full use of their  trademark strategic genius.  Panzers roll, machine guns crackle, the roar  of jet engines fills the air.  Wargamers and weekend historians are sure to  have a good time, and even non-historians will probably enjoy the action  and intrigue.	2000-07-24

Guns of the South, however, really deserves it.  It is Turtledove's most famous book, and one of his best.<br />Being that Turtledove is best known for his  AH, it is somewhat strange that his most famous novel starts out with a  science fiction theme.  To make a short story a little shorter, a band of  South African white supremacists travel back in time and arm Robert E.  Lee's forces with AK-47s and an abundant supply of ammo. <br />Despite this  bizarre premise, however, The Guns of the South is also a very interesting  work of alternate history.  Using their new weapon, the Confederates force  a peace settlement, thus securing their independence.  But that's only the  first part of the book.  The rest is a fascinating tale of alternate  politics.  Now that the Southerners have secured their nationhood, what  will happen next?  Who will succeed Jefferson Davis to the presidency?   What about slavery?  All of these questions are asked and answered in a  satisfactory fashion.<br />Another selling point is the portrayal of Robert E.  Lee.  As one of the viewpoint characters, he is constantly in the literary  spotlight.  His portrayal is well-balanced and highly detailed, obviously  the product of a great deal of research.<br />And there's plenty more of  Turtledove's trademark military action later in the book.  I won't  elaborate too much, but suffice to say that Lee's South African saviors are  not quite what they seem.<br />This may not be Turtledove's very best novel,  but it's up there.  A great read!	2000-07-15

It was the basic text for my 11th Grade history course, where it provided a good balance of mildly amusing wit and genuinely useful information.<br />The main advantage of  &quot;The American Pageant&quot; is that the author is not trying to push a  major political agenda.  It lacks the patriotic drivel for which  &quot;traditional&quot; history texts are often denounced.  However, it  also lacks the negative, depressing Socialist philosophy which makes Zinn's  &quot;People's History of the United States&quot; so difficult to  read.<br />The end result is a history text which does a history text's job:  telling what happened.  The book covers politics, economics, and major  events in a style which is sometimes amusing and usually informative.   Although not overly political, it also pays due attention to such important  issues as race and gender.<br />Not a particularly &quot;specialized&quot;  book, but an excellent survey text.	2000-07-15

It tends to sacrifice  historical accuracy for political proselytizing.  Howard Zinn's  &quot;Peoples' History of the United States&quot; is a case in point:  almost everything Zinn says seems dedicated to supporting the author's  left-wing agenda.<br />Hofstadter's book neatly transcends this problem. It is  most definitely revisionist.  Each chapter examines a different American  political leader, with a great deal of in-depth detail and criticism.   However, Hofstadter escapes the political trap of mentioning only the  negative or only the positive points about his subjects.  Both sides are  always examined in detail.<br />This evenhandedness results in a very  interesting and useful text.  Rather than heroes and villains, our past  politicians come across as human beings, and very interesting ones at  that.<br />A choice history text, both detailed and objective.	2000-07-15

And this book deserves it.  As well as an evocative portrayal of a very depressing parallel world, it is an exciting, well-done mystery  thriller.<br />It must be admitted that the point of divergence is not  terribly original or realistic: Germany, utilising superior strategy and  technology, defeated Russia and forced a peace agreement on Britain in  1944.  As a result, Berlin came to dominate all of Western Europe via a  monolithic EEU-like organization.  The USA remains defiant, however, and a  trans-Atlantic Cold War ensues.<br />Not the most creative historical  background, perhaps, but the alternate world is still handled very well.   Most of the story takes place in this world's Berlin, where Albert Speers'  grand architectural vision has become reality.  Vast domes and palaces  tower over the city, embodying the triumph of the Nazi way.  Adolf Hitler  himself continues to rule his nation with an iron fist.  But amidst all  this imperial grandeur, the population lives a life of bitter oppression.   Gestapo informers are everywhere.  Anyone who speaks out against the system  disappears without a trace.  Harris captures this environment very  effectively.  The paranoia, violence, and claustrophobia of a true  totalitarian society really come to life.<br />The plot takes place in the  '60s, as the USA and the Greater German Reich work towards towards  friendlier relations.  The President and Der Fuhrer are planning a summit  meeting.  Is it time for a new era of peace?<br />Then German police detective  Xavier March is called in to investigate a death by drowning.  What starts  out as routine police work suddenly turns very complex when the deceased is  found to be a high Nazi official.  Then it transpires that, shortly before  his death, he was in contact with two other Nazi officials.  Soon, one of  them turns up dead, too.  What seemed a freak accident soon becomes part of  a highly suspicious, and highly disturbing, pattern.  Xavier March's  investigation leads him into the heart of a terrifying conspiracy... a  conspiracy of which he himself may well be the next victim.<br />The plot  moves at an energetic pace against the film-noirish background of Berlin,  carrying the reader through a fascinating, page-turning alternate history  extravaganza.<br />Fatherland lacks the military and political aspects present  in many AHs, which may disappoint some readers.  But in terms of adventure  and atmosphere, it is top notch.	2000-07-13
US	49940939	R3300PP4BBW2PG	0671577948	912869365	The Domination	Books	4	66	67	N	N	One of the Standard Texts of modern AH	If you've ever looked at an alternate history wep site or discussion group, you've no doubt noticed numerous references to the Draka books.  Some say they're great works of alternate history, some say they're  unrealistic garbage.  Either way, these books seem to inspire a great deal  of emotion.  So what's the buzz about?  Find out in this volume, which  contains all of the original Draka trilogy (Marching through Georgia, Under  the Yoke, and the Stone Dogs).<br />This series has a somewhat unusual point  of divergence.  It came in the 1770s, when Britain conquered South Africa.   After the American Revolution, many of the defeated British loyalists moved  to this fledgling colony, where they went about building a new nation,  which eventually came to be called the Draka Domination. This energetic,  militaristic slave-holding society rapidly spread across the continent of  Africa, becoming a power in its own right.  At this point, the timeline  gets somewhat improbable.  Despite the presence of this large, powerful,  economically influential political entity, the rest of the world develops  much as it did in real life (although the USA successfully conquers Canada,  Mexico, and central America during the course of the 19th century).  It  seems that the Draka should have a much bigger impact on history.<br />Dispite  the problem of plausibility, however, this volume makes for a very  compelling read.  The Draka are in the unique position of being both  fascinating protagonists and terrifying villains. Throughout the course of  the (one-volume) trilogy, most of the viewpoint characters are Draka.  We  are given an in-depth look at their society, which places great emphasis on  both military prowess and artistic talent.  However, we also see the dark  side of this society.  The Draka oversee huge masses of slaves, who are  brutally exploited and violently (often fatally) punished for the smallest  offense.  They have no respect for the laws of war, for all capturedenemies join the ranks of these slaves.  The Draka, who take this  nightmarish system for granted, are a truly chilling creation.<br />The  stories themselves are exciting and well-written.  Each book in the trilogy  is very different from the others in tone and setting, but all are very  effective.<br />Marching through Georgia is a straight war novel, set in the  early 1940s.  The Draka Domination has gone to war against Hitler's Third  Reich, and the two nations are heading towards a showdown in the Caucasus.   The protagonist leads a small but highly trained and well equipped force of  Draka paratroopers against the Waffen SS in a series of violent, graphic,  blood-drenced battles.  There is a stronger emphasis on bullets than on  brains, but it's a very enjoyable military adventure.<br />Under the Yoke is  set several years later, during this world's Cold War.  The Draka have  overrun all of continental Europe and most of Asia.  They are opposed by a  US-led coalition of free nations (the Alliance for Democracy) containing  all of the Americas plus Britain, Japan, India, and Indochina, and  Australia.  Part of the plot follows a US secret agent who is slipped into  Northern Europe, while the other part deals with recently-enslaved  Europeans, who must learn to live in a world without freedom, hope, or  diginity.  The two plotlines converge as the Alliance for Democracy  struggles, with the help of European resistance fighters, to maintain its  lead in nuclear technology.  A satisying, if unusually gory, espionage  thriller.<br />The Stone Dogs continues this alternate Cold War as both the  Alliance and the Domination continue to build their strength.  The Draka  perfect genetic engineering, while the free nations make great leaps in the  physical and computer sciences, and both blocs establish their presence  throughout the solar system.  This book is bigger in scope and therefore a  little less focused than the other two, ranging from espionage in France to  military action in India to various intrigues throughout the Solar System.   Still, it provides an enthralling picture of a far more intense Cold War  against an utterly implacable foe.    <br />Good reads throughout, but not for  people with weak stomaches.  There is a huge amount of unusually graphic  violence, unusually nasty executions, and unusually sadistic torture.   There is also a great deal of sex, much of it lesbian (the Draka seem to be  universally bisexual).  For those who can handle this sort of thing,  however, this is a very worthwhile AH/SF tale.	2000-07-05
US	49940939	RSYJCC3G4VREV	0312869150	536013485	Darkness Descending (World at War, Book 2)	Books	4	21	21	N	N	Smaug meets the Luftwaffe	Turtledove's usual formula is to write a story set in our world, but with different events.  This time, he's reversed the formula: different world, same events.  This series (which began with &quot;Into The Darkness&quot;)  tells the tale of World War II reenacted by a plethora of fantasy kingdoms.   Strange as this idea may be, it's working very well.  The first volume was  good, enjoyable military fiction, and this one is no different.<br />Events  proceed more or less according to historical schedule.  Algarve launches a  massive blitz against Unkerlant, which, although initially successful, runs  into some problems with the local weather.  Lagoas attacks the Yaninan  colonies in the Land of the Ice People, and Kuusamo joins the  Anti-Algarvian alliance.  I won't say any more, for fear of giving away the  plot.  But if you know WWII history, you can probably guess what  happens.<br />My review of &quot;Into The Darkness&quot; included my analysis  of the story's politics.  I shall now make some modifications.<br />I formerly  stated that Unkerlant represented Russia.  I now see that it stands in for  China, as well.  Gyongyos (Japan) invades Unkerlant, which must symbolise  the Sino-Japanese war, since Japan and Russia didn't fight until the last  weeks of WWII. <br />I also stated that Yanina represents either Italy or the  Balkans.  I now see that it represents both.  It's status as a buffer  between Algarve and Unkerlant suggests the Balkans, whereas it's colonial  presence in the Land of the Ice People (Africa) suggests Italy.<br />I also  assumed that Siaulia was Australia.  This now seems unlikely.  It is  mentioned that the Derlavian powers are fighting a naval war there, which  would suggest the East Indies.<br />Now, for some more analysis.  (I hope you  guys at Amazon don't mind these long reviews).<br />Interestingly, it is  mentioned that Unkerlanter behemoths are larger than Algarvian ones.  This  probably recalls the Russian T-34, which was perhapsthe best tank of its  era.<br />It is also interesting to note Kuusamo's (i.e., the U.S.'s) reason  for joining the war.  In real life, the U.S. only joined the war after its  territory had been directly attacked.  In this story, however, it joins in  response to the cruel Algarvian institution of the victory camp (i.e.,  Dachau, Treblinka, et al).  In short, the U.S. is given a more altruistic  motive than it actually had (this is not a criticism of the USA- I think  Pearl Harbor was reason enough!).  This may well be an example of  Turtledove's politics shining through.<br />There you have it!  I could say a  lot more, but it probably wouldn't interest you much!  But be assured, when  the next book in the series comes around, I'll be there to review it!	2000-06-27

I'm very glad I have.  All Warhammer novels are great, but this is the best of the lot.  <br />Over the 12+ years that it has existed,  the Warhammer 40,000 universe has become one of the most detailed science  fiction/fantasy/horror settings ever created, via the massive amounts of  flavor text contained in all of the publications. The monstrously  over-populated hive worlds, the steaming alien jungles, the towering  titans, the clunky war machines, the war-loving Orks, the hideous Tyranids,  the cthulan Chaos Gods, and the terrifying fascist theocracy of the human  Imperium have become a permanent part of my mentality. <br />Ian Watson, in a  dense, poetic stylie, brings this universe to life better than anyone else.   His protagonist is Jaq Draco who, after a long career of mercilessly  slaughtering the Emperor's &quot;enemies&quot;, has stumbled upon a  horrifying conspiracy to overthrow the Imperium.  He must stop it, but is  not quite sure where to start...  Along the way, Draco begins to develop a  conscience.  For a man who lives to kill and destroy, this is the worst  thing that could possibly happen...  Draco's slow, painful transformation  from an unfeeling killing machine to a feeling (and internally tormented)  killing machine is one of the best parts of the story (which continues in  Harlequin and Chaos Child, both highly recommended).  <br />One of the coolest  (and scariest) parts of the Warhammer 40,000 game setting is that there are  no good guys.  The Tyranids and the Chaos Gods may be terrible, but it is  hard to say that the human Imperium is any better.  The horribly mutated  Judeo-Christian religion which has sprung up around the Emperor is  completely and utterly intolerant, calling for the brutal extermination of  even the slightest heresy.  In order to defend &quot;national  security&quot;, the Imperial defense forces are perfectly willing to  destroyentire inhabited planets.  This situation, also, is brilliantly  handled by Watson.  At the beginning, it is clear that no one has any  freedom of thought whatsoever. Only slowly and painfully does Draco begin  to develop this freedom, and it does not make him a happy man...  And  although this Imperium spans a million stars, it is obvious throughout that  there is nothing even slightly progressive about it.  From the absolute  thought control, to the suffocatingly over-crowded cities, to the  povery-stricken masses, the overall feeling is that of a reactionary empire  in a state of unending decay.  Late in the book, Draco visits the Imperial  capital on Ancient Earth.  Here, in the glorious human homeland, he finds a  horribly polluted, horribly crowded world-spanning city, where gang members  struggle in vain for meagre civil-service positions, where endless rows of  scribes spend their entire lives copying records with simple pens, where  people  happily kill their neighbors as heretics, and  cybernetically-modified cripples live in permanent darkness, knee-deep in  sludge, struggling to maintain the city's rusting infrastructure.  Next to  this life, being enslaved by the Draka seems like Shangri-La.    <br />Since  reading this book, I have read many of Ian Watson's other novels, and have  loved them all.  None, however, have compared to the style, dark poetry,  and utter nastiness of Inquisitor.  More than any other novel, this one  truly proves that game-related fiction can stand its ground against the  best the mainstream has to offer.  And the sequels are just as good.  If  remorseless pessimism doesn't bother you, it is hard to imagine a better  read.	2000-05-13
US	49940939	R3QDYMU77JZIP6	0060926430	350275263	People's History of the United States, A	Books	2	27	43	N	N	Ideology, not history	This has got to be one of the most controversial books featured on Amazon.  Reviews seem divided between Liberals (who think Zinn is God) and Conservatives (who think he's Satan).  Here's what I say: Zinn may make  some good points (I haven't checked his sources, so I can't be sure), but  doesn't seem strongly concerned with historical realism.  In fact, almost  everything he says seems geared towards furthering a Marxist political  agenda.  This results in America being grossly misrepresented.  Zinn makes  it sound as if anything in support of the Upper and Middle classes is Evil,  whereas anything is favor of the Lower class is Good.  The supposed reason:  the Lower class somehow represents &quot;the people&quot; (and therefore  the country's best interests) more than the Middle and Upper classes.  If  Zinn were to check any actual statistics, he would discover that MOST of  America is Middle class.  If anything, this would make the Middle class  MORE representative than the Lower class.  I am not saying that the  government shouldn't take action for the Lower class: they should (what  kind of action?  I have no idea).  All I am saying is that it is unfair to  make anyone who is NOT poor into a villain (Zinn admits that the Middle  class might be redeemed, but sees no hope for the Upper class).  I  understand that Zinn doesn't have the space or time to include EVERYONE'S  viewpoints.  That's okay.  No one does.  The problem is that Zinn presents  his own (very narrow) viewpoints as the only road to Utopia (which they  clearly are not).  In fact, he goes to such extreme legths to prove his  point that a great deal is left out.  For example, he lingers for pages  over the negative aspects of Capitalism, The Civil War, and World War II,  but says practically nothing about the GENERAL course of these subjects and  events.  At some point, is stops looking like history and starts looking  like pure Dialectical (i.e., Marxist) drawl.  One particular blunder on  Zinn's part: he glorifies the Communist Party for having taken a pacifistic  stance in the US and the UK in 1939.  He seems to ignore the fact that the  Communists joined the war two years later- on the same side as America and  Britain!  A little partisanism on the part of our historians is hard to  avoid, but Zinn takes it way too far.  If you are interested in Left Wing  politics, you should probably buy this book.  If you are looking for a good  history text, look elsewhere.	2000-03-26

It's hard to imagine history and fantasy working together, but Harry Turtledove pulls it off.  Fantasy provides the setting, history provides the action.  At first, this book did not excite me as much as Turtledove's  other works.  It sounded a little to weird.  But once I started reading, I  knew I had nothing to fear.  I have come to recognise Turtledove as one of  the most reliably entertaining novelists out there, and this one is no  exception.  As you might have picked up from the earlier reviews, this  novel is a very faithful retelling of World War II with a &quot;spells and  dragons&quot; fantasy world for a setting.  Although the plot, by  definition, isn't very original, the world is quite fascinating.  It's  interesting to see all the creative ways in which the presence of magic  makes up for the absence of technology.  Many previous reviewers have  speculated on who represents who.  Here are my guesses, along with the  reasoning behind them:<br />Algarve is Germany.  This is fairly obvious.  It  is the large, powerful country which everyone is afraid of.  The Behemoth  Blitzkrieg is another big tip-off.<br />Unkerlant is the USSR.  Again, fairly  obvious.  It is another large, frightening empire.  Even Algarve tries to  avoid them (at first), just as Hitler avoided Stalin until he had the rest  of continental Europe pacified.  There is also a cruel Stalin analogue in  charge.<br />Forthweg is Poland.  It is the first country to fall, and ends up  being divided between Algarve and Unkerlant.<br />The Duchy of Bari is  Austria.  The Algarvians march in to a hero's welcome.<br />Yanina might be  Italy, but is more likely one of the Balkan countries.  It is a much  smaller but still potentially significant ally to Algarve.  They also serve  as a buffer against Unkerlant (which suggests the Balkans).<br />I can't be  sure, but I think Sibiu is the Netherlands.  Just as the Dutch were caught  off-guard by paratroopers, the Sibians are caught off-guard by a  carefully-organized sea attack.<br />Jelgava and Valmiera are France and  Belgium.  They fight bravely against Algarve, but are defeated fairly  easily.  I am not sure which is which, but am inclined to say that Valmiera  is France, due to Krasta's aristocratic snobbery.<br />Zuwayza is Finland.  It  puts up effective resistance against Unkerlant, but is overwhelmed by sheer  weight of numbers.  They also negotiate a revenge alliance with Algarve,  just as finland did with Hitler.<br />Lagoas is Britain.  As an island nation,  it is the only anti-Algarvian country able to escape invasion.<br />Kuusamo is  the United States.  They have remained out of the war with Algarve so far,  and seem to be on the brink of discovering a magical A-bomb  (M-bomb?).<br />Gyongyos is Japan.  They are fighting an island war against  Kuusamo, and are constantly referred to as &quot;Gongs&quot;.<br />The Land of  the Ice People is Africa.  The rest of the world considers it very  unpleasant, but builds colonies there for economic reasons (sure to offend  the heck out of Afrocentrists). <br />Siaulia hasn't really been introduced to  the story yet, but I'll bet it's Australia.  The map makes it out to be a  large but sparsely populated (no major cities) land mass.   <br />Ortah has  likewise not been introduced, but would appear to be Switzeland.  It's  small, mountainous, neutral, and in the middle of the continent.	2000-03-15
US	49940939	R21AZM3356AZFA	0451457706	435165083	Men of War (The Lost Regiment #8)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	The Best Historical SF In The WORLD!	&lt;The following review applies to the entire Lost Regiment series&gt;  I have already written online reviews of Turtledove's &quot;Colonization&quot; series and Flint's &quot;1632&quot;.  I loved  them.  I also loved Stirling's &quot;Nantucket&quot; books.  However, I  would not give any of them five stars.  Why not?  I was saving that honor  for this series.  Forstchen's &quot;Lost Regiment&quot; books (this one  plus seven previous volumes) are, quite simply, the best Historical SF on  the market.  Turtledove, Stirling, and Flint all write excellent novels,  but none of them can quite match the plotting, action, characters, and pure  emotional power of this series.  The story (in my mind) is the stuff of  legend.  A transport ship full of civil-war Yankees (one regiment of  infantry and one artillery battery) is mysteriously teleported to a strange  new world, a world in which a master race of aliens has reduced humanity  (over the millenia, many other groups of people, including Republican  Romans and medieval Russians, have also found themselves transported to  this world) to the level of cattle, to be devoured at whim.  Now it's time  for those bastards to start worrying.  The Yanks' rifles and cannon are  more powerful than any other weapons in the world (although it is implied  that the aliens were once a star-faring civilization, they have long ago  been reduced to the technology and tactics of Mongol horse-archers),  capable of mowing down massive numbers of local warriors.  Still, the  aliens have them vastly outnumbered.   But the Yankees have a much more  powerful weapon on hand: the American way.  Heartened by the newfangled  notions of freedom and democracy, the local humans are ready to take a  stand.  The Americans, who use their technological know-how to create a  modern industrial society, give them a fighting chance.  But it will not be  such and easy fight, for the aliens learn quickly...  The conflict lasts  eight books, and never gets boring.This series has it all: terrific battle  scenes, excellent characters (I don't think I've ever become so attached to  any group of protagonists), dirty politics, brilliant technological  innovations, blood-drenched horror (the aliens commit some of the most  imaginative attrocities I've ever read about...), heart-rending tragedy,  touching romance, and the invincible power of freedom.  One thing is always  clear: terror and oppression are no match for justice and liberty.	2000-03-11

If you're anything like me, you probably just buy all his books without reading the reviews.  All the same, here goes:      This is not a typical Turtledove series.   Gone is the non-stop, ultra-violent military action of the &quot;Great  War&quot;, &quot;World War&quot;, and &quot;Darkness&quot; books (all of  which are great reads).  The world is at peace, but it is not a very  comfortable peace.  Himmler (who now dominates Western Europe) is plotting  against the Race, Molotov is wondering what to do about Himmler, the UK is  becoming more and more &quot;Nazified&quot;, and even the USA has secrets  to hide.  Meanwhile, the Lizards are facing savage guerrilla resistance  from the Chinese (led by Mao and his Communists) and the Arabs (led by  Ayatollah Khomeini).      However, despite the change of pace, Turtledove  has lost none of his narrative abilities.  The characters (both human and  suarian) are as amusing and interesting as ever, and the (numerous)  plotlines are very enjoyable.  There may not be as much action as in some  of Turttledove's other books, but the reader is always left wondering what  will happen next.      This alternate history creates numerous  possibilites, and I hope that Turtledove will explore some of them.  For  example, how about a Cyberpunk story set in an alternate 21st century? What  self-respecting Turtledove fan wouldn't kill to see a Lizard in  mirrorshades and a leather jacket?	2000-03-05
