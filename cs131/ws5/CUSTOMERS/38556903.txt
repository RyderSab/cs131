The tragic episcopate of John Chrysostom opened the struggle of supremacy in the East...\\" W.H.C. Frend<br /><br />St. John Chrysostom:<br />Recognized to be among the most powerful orators of Christianity, John Chrysostom was the most prolific of the Fathers, leaving us with many sermons, letters, treatises and apologetic works. An incredible orator, his sermons often moved his audience to tears or applause.<br />\\"Although not a formal polemicist, John Chrysostom influenced Christian thought notably. He wrote brilliant homilies, interpreting the Bible literally and historically rather than allegorically. His accomplishments as a preacher and theologian are marred by a virulent anti-Semitism.\\" The Columbia Encyclopedia<br /><br />J.C., Golden Mouth:<br />The eminent author, described his book as, 'the Story of J.C.,' defining his selected offices as, 'Ascetic, Preacher, Bishop.' In the words of Fr. Sydney Griffith, one of the foremost Patristic scholars, \\"One does not mean to complain immoderately, nor to appear ungrateful for what is on its own terms a good study of an important topic; nor does one want to review a book the author never intended to write.\\" But here is the place to plead for a broadening of perspective on the part of students of the early fathers.<br />Kelly recomposed the life of John Chrysostom in chronological order from his youth andascetic stage to his further development as a prolific preacher, that supported his pick as Archbishop of Constantinople and his career therein the capital. He remained a great orator and moralist preacher of literal exegesis, with social and political orientation. For which Kelly exposed the court politics and John's struggle to be faithful to his cause, criticizing Empress Eudoxia, and inviting problems with Patriarch Theophilus, of Alexandria who has consecrated him. John's conflicts led to his condemnation at the Synod of the Oak, and was eventually sent into his final exile, where he died on the way.<br /><br />Non-vindicated John:<br />J. Kelly, described by The NY Times as, 'not only a distinguished church historian but also an elegant stylist,' remains for me and many, a reference on early Christian Creeds and Doctrines, in the first place, and expected to bring to the tragic career of the great preaching orator new lights to his thought, and vindicate his patristic literature as; \\"There is little original in his thought. He preserves throughout the moralizing tendencies of his Antiochene teachers,\\" alleged to him by two great patrologists J. Danielou, and RPC Hanson. Earlier in the same chapter, J.C. is described as the friend of Theodore of Mopsuestia, and pupil of Libanius and of Diodore of Tarsus, and cast heavy shadow on his ethics as more Stoic than Christian! (J. Danielou, Historical Theology, Pelican, 1970, p.107)<br /><br />A Story, not a Biography:<br />In his preface, the oxford scholar gives a version of his elaboration on the 79/80 lectures in Oxford devoted to J.C., but were not published because of Kelly's non satisfaction of his own treatment, and few years later, he modified them to chapters 2,3, and 16 of Golden Mouth. The author who explored Chrysostom's teaching on baptism, original sin, grace and free will, redemption, etc., in his classic 'Early Christian Doctrines', would not even quote himself, in reference. At least, John's treatise on the priesthood, which has been popular, though not accepted by mainstream Protestants, could have been given a brief parallel with St. Gregory Nazianzen who inspired John, but spoke in a different theological language. He concluded, \\"I should like to have included some tentative presuppositions underlying John's thinking, and certain of his theological ideas which still need clarification. Ultimately he decided to leave this task to 'younger scholars.'<br /><br />Biographer J. Kelly:<br />The late Master of ecclesiastics J.N.D. Kelly is the Principal of St. Edmund Hall,Oxford, was Canon of Chichester Cathedral, a Fellow of the British Academy, and since 1966 a member of the Academic Council of the Ecumenical Theological Institute, Jerusalem.

He stresses contemplation pre-eminence, and how God's rememberance was in the thought of Basil, concluding with John of Kronstadt that, 'Prayer is therefore the life of the Spirit.'<br /><br />Fr.

To a folklorist, it is utter folly to attempt to reconcile such diversity.\\" Patricia McBroom<br /><br />Folklore in Oral Transmission:<br />My dad never described the Old Testament narratives as mythical, but he convincingly argued that since it was written after centuries of oral tradition was tinted with variants of ideas and theologies.<br />Most biblical scholars acknowledge that the Old Testament was orally transmitted for decades before appearing in written form. Dundes offers a new and exciting way to understand its variant texts, using the analytical framework of folklore to unearth and contrast the multiple versions of nearly every major biblical event, including the creation of woman, the flood, the ten commandments, among many others.<br /><br />Interpreting the Bible as folklore:<br />Using his expert knowledge of folklore, Dundes unearths and contrasts multiple versions of most major biblical event, to helps us resolve some of the mysteries and contradictions that evolved during the Bible's prewritten legacy and that persist in the Great Book today. With great reverence for the Bible, Dundes offers a new and exciting way to resolve some of the mysteries and contradictions that evolved during the Bible's prewritten legacy and that still persist today. \\"People say this is an oral tradition, but then they proceed to search for one true variant,\\" said Dundes, \\"In oral literature, there is no such thing. This is not meant to be disrespectful, but people should stop worrying about the discrepancies among the stories. They don't matter. This doesn't mean the Bible isn't true, or that it isn't a sacred text,\\" He hastened to explain.<br /><br />Multiple Versions of same stories?<br />Professor Dundes reports examples of what he describes as 'multiple versions of various stories' that appear in the Bible. He believes that these stories were circulated for decades and even centuries as an oral tradition. During that time, each version of the stories subtlety changed as it was circulated before it was recorded in written form. From the discrepancies among the various version of the same story, he concluded not only that the Bible contains folklore, but that the Bible is folklore. Dundes writes: \\"It simply means that the Bible is oral literature that has been written down, and the nature of oral literature is that there must be two or more versions of any story...the Bible clearly manifests the basic distinctive criteria of folklore: namely multiple existence and variation.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Alan Dundes:<br />Known as a world class authority on folklore, Alan Dundes, is a professor of folklore and anthropology, University of California, Berkeley.

Dr. John Watson, reports in a tightly woven quartet of essays on listening, analyzing, and concluding with four outstanding thinkers: Thomas Merton: A Christian Sufi-phile, Episcopalian Bishop Kenneth Cragg, an Islamic scholar and Arabist. Alternatively, he exposes their thought 'in contrast with' two eminent Moslem Thinkers. Late Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian theorist of the Moslem Brotherhood, who claimed, \\"Islam is the solution that should be imposed by force, 'is compared with Ziauddin Sardar, a contemporary post modern Islamist, a sociopolitical think-tank, who relates world problems to the scope and execution of Fundamental Evangelicals, led by U. Chicago's Strauss, and their agenda as described by S. Huntington in \\"The clash of Civilizations.\\"<br /><br />The Four Islamic Scholars:<br /><br />Dr. Watson, a master biographer, introduces the thinkers in a thorough but lively and personal way. To listen attentively, you should know the strong credentials of the speaker. Starting with Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, mystic and poet, of whom the author proposes in a cautionary remark that, \\"There is no evidence that Merton grasped any of the essential conflicts within Islam,\\" he proceeds with more authoritative thinkers on the issues of Islamic thought.<br /><br />He contrasts the Mystic with the late Sayyid Qutb, a contemporary Radical Islamic theorist, and the modern legislator of Islamic Fundamentalism who has composed the Moslem brotherhood non compromising radical Ideological and Political agenda of Jihad; before his execution by Nasser in 1965. Qutb's main manifesto is exposed in, \\"In the Shade of the Quran.\\"<br /><br />Hopful Vs Prophetic Views:<br /><br />From the grim views of violence to the hopeful concepts of Bp. Kenneth Cragg; an Arabic scholar, who translated the Quran, and an acclaimed author in the field of Muslim-Christian relations. He made his debut in his outstanding book, 'Call of the Minaret' half a century ago.  Cragg continued writing profusely on interfaith issues including; 'Jesus and the Muslim,' and 'Muhammad and the Christian,' within his abiding faith in Christ love, he has a heart for Moslems.<br /><br />Ziauddin Sardar; is the last but not the least, a highly renowned advanced Islamic thinker and sociopolitical critical analyst. He became one of U. K. leading intellectuals and writes on a wide variety of subjects in the English Media, worldwide. Sardar Addresses the frame of mind that Islamic terrorists ultimately fail, defeated by America's Crusade that fastidiously succeeds, in 'democratizing' two Moslem nations, Afghanistan & Iraq. He authored the \\"quartet for revolution,\\" last of which is his international bestseller \\"Why Do People Hate America?\\"<br /><br />Abrogation Concept:<br /><br />Abrogation undermines peaceful relations with 'People of the Book,' or believers in Judaism and Christianity. In Islamic theology and Ethics, the concept of abrogation employed by some schools of Muslim thought refers to the notion that later Quranic revelations in Medina annul and abolish earlier pacific and fraternal Meccan revelations. According to the leading ulama the position of zimmies (non-Muslim) in the Islamic States would be that they will not have the same rights as Muslims, and pay a head tax.<br /><br />This controversial core issue was underlined by the author, who calls for the extremely difficult task of subjecting Muslim holy scripture to textual and theological criticism, a call that recently endangered the life of the exiled Egyptian professor Nasr Abu Zaid, and endangered the careers of his precursors.<br /><br />Understanding upon reflection:<br /><br />The author draws parallels between Qutb's terrorist manifesto, and thesis of the 'Christian abortive crusades', postulating that violence, if only a temporary sedation, is not a lasting cure for this mental illness of terrorism, which is both contagious and dangerous. While every essay gives the reader a different angle of the vast scene, I confirmed my conviction that Qutb is the ideologue who represents today's minority violent attitude to the revival of the Islamic Ummah, within a helpless majority of peaceful Moslems.<br /><br />Bishop Cragg's views, in spite of his deep understanding is either a hopeful or overdue expression of a Christian utopia; a mirage of dialogue with the few Moslem elite who has no influence on the Islamic Street. The evident example is there in \\"The Islamic Republic of Iran,\\" the only nation which can claim Islam as a social and political driving power behind its governing theocracy.ferent angle of the vast scene, I confirmed my conviction that Qutb is the ideologue who represents today's minority violent attitude to the revival of the Islamic Ummah, within a helpless majority of peaceful Moslems. <br />Bishop Cragg's views, in spite of his deep understanding is either a hopeful or overdue expression of a Christian utopia; a mirage of dialogue with the few Moslem elite who has no influence on the Islamic Street.

Even so it was a radicalism that came fully into the open only relatively late.\\" Colin Brown<br /><br />\\"Honest to God, published in 1963, was one of the most public religious bestsellers of the twentieth century. Because it was written by an Anglican bishop it was especially controversial. Yet there are questions that remain and this article highlights seven such questions which draw attention to weaknesses in the book. An alternative proposal is offered here. Robinson had his finger on a real problem in postwar British church life and, in a measure, theology.<br /><br />I believe the problem was mostly or largely caused not by the New Testament and historic Christianity itself, but by the way in which the post-Enlightenment world had assimilated and re-expressed the Christian faith. What Robinson referred to when speaking of supra or supernaturalism belonged within an essentially Deist or Epicurean framework, and he was struggling with the unwelcome consequences of people being unable to relate to their absentee landlord, and simultaneously puzzling over the fact that some people did not find this a problem.<br /><br />The huge popularity of his book shows that he struck a chord with a great many people. The tragedy of Honest to God, as I perceive it, is that Robinson did not see that what he was rejecting was a form of supernaturalism pressed upon Christianity by the Enlightenment; that he did not therefore go looking for help in finding other ways of holding together what the classic Christian tradition has claimed about God.\\"--N.T. Wright, Doubts about Doubt: Honest to God Forty Years On<br /><br />Honest to God, still alive!<br />Whatever the late Bishop of Woolwich intended, it was in true honesty to the Church he served, and the congregating audience he came to address, even if it was not clear then, how faithful was he to traditional ways of expression when thinking about the Lord he was honest to. If there is anything to be said, in retrospective, about this book rests with the fact that it is still controversial, in these postmodern days of applying deconstruction tools to redefine faith.<br /><br />Recently Gretta Vosper of the Canadian Center for Progressive Christianity said, \\"Over forty years of scholarship and argument later, we cannot shrink from Robinson's vision. We too, must look at it directly and rise to his challenge, recasting our understanding of Christianity, examining the structures that have supported it, clearing away those things that would keep us from seeing it clearly; for it's time to step more and more boldly into the realities of this world as we experience them, to open ourselves to an honest critique of our Christian heritage, and to expose ourselves to the light of new understandings that so many have placed before us. It's time.\\"<br /><br />Inspiration into Honesty:<br />The bishop, wrote his radical thesis while confined to his house due to a back injury that stranded for some weeks. His book was inspired by the same thinkers who were favorite to both and most mid century generation of theologians: Barth, Tillich, and Bonhoeffer. Although what Robinson wrote came fully into the open causing a turmoil, it was preceded by the then recently published 'Beyond Religion,' written by D. Jenkins. Robinson further enriched the clash with supporting quotations from Catholic liberation leaders of 'La Nouvelle Theologie,' De Lubac, and Congar, in addition to his favorite existential Jewish philosopher Martin Buber.<br /><br />Robinson's Radical theology:<br />Within the postmodern worldview, there is no secure place for institutional religion, the ground on which the concept of God prevailed has gradually eroded. With the explosion of scientific discoveries, and their dominant secular interpretation, the Bishop's inquiry on the \\"place does God have in my life or in society today?\\" urging for a radical new methodology in Christian thinking, caused a lot of uncertainty. \\"Admittedly, the Bishop did not say much that was new. Much of it was straightforward nineteenth century radicalism, brought up to date by the language of Bultmann, Tillich and Bonhoeffer who are treated as the three wise men of twentieth century theology. the novelty lay partly in the fact that here someone bringing the three together for the first time, and trying to make a synthesis out of them,\\"(Philosophy & the Christian Faith)<br /><br />A Controversial Theology Book:<br />No-one ever imagined a thin paperback written by an unassuming English bishop while recovering from illness would become one of the most talked about theological books of the turbulent 1960s. ...

Among those included are Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus of Lyons, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Athanasius, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine of Hippo, Martin Luther, and many others. The reader of this book will experience: an ecumenical journey in time and space to discover ancient Christian traditions, through delving into the patristic door.

His first patristic example was Ignatius of Antioch, allegedly the kid who offered the five loaves to Lord Jesus. His masterful statement is, p17: \\"Thus martyrdom comes as a natural culmination of a far more prosaic process of kenosis (self emptying) from \\"The shadow of the Flesh\\":<br /><br />A tour of the Mystics:<br /><br />Starting with Philo the mystical Jew, Irenaeus, and the Apophatic Alexandrines: Clement, Origen, in a fascinating virtual tour. Origen and Athanasius struggled with the meaning of sharing the divine life. Gregory of Nyssa wrote about imitating the pattern of God's life as revealed in Jesus. Throughout the book, Bp.

The desert (Antony, Macarius, and the desert fathers). He refers here to D. Chitty's book: The desert, a city. The Monastery is the third development in his account, John Cassian now carries to the West this monastic ideal of Pachomian system of 'Organized Spirituality,' where Benedict relaxes the rule, then Bernard of Clairvaux (12th century), returns back to the serious desert tradition of self mortification, kenosis, or mortifying our negative passions, which leaves the disciple in complete darkness: Ps. 73:22<br /><br />Ecstasy & understanding:<br /><br />Here R. Williams contrasts the Apophaic tradition of the great Syrian mystic of pseudonym; Dennis the Areopagite with the Cataphatic Aristotelian theology of Thomas Aquinas, a back shift from Neo-Platonism of the East. Johannes Elkhart, another Dominican was dubbed heretical by those who could not perceive his mystical expressions.<br /><br />End Of Christendom:<br /><br />The Sign of the Son of Man: Luther and Ockham, reformation and its dogmas: Faith, and Sola Scriptura. In the secret stair: Williams recounts in the \\"Way of Denial,\\" from a similar spiritual experience of john of the Cross and Luther, both being in hell, but broke off differently through an apophatic versus Luther's cataphatic solution.

This book is intended as a companion reader to the author's apologia; looking into Orthodox traditions, of Liturgy and theology. The concise essays provide enough information to get the reader briefed on various topics, authored by eminent Eastern Orthodox, where the Evangelical editor comment on the theological message of the essay itself.<br /><br />No lesser an Orthodox than the Editor, I would recommend this collection of essays as a broad spectrum introductory readership to Eastern Orthodox Doctrine: teaching (Doctrine: from Doctor i.e. Teacher of the church), in spite of being a monotonic essays rather than Chatechetical dialogue (in the Alexandrine sense it should be Q & A dialogue)<br /><br />Orthodox Essays Roaster:<br /><br />Daniel Clendenin, an Evangelical student of Eastern Orthodoxy, who critically examined and proved aware of Orthodox practices to the amazement of most Easterners and Orientals, is on InterVarsity staff at Stanford University. The knowledgeable book editor, who once wrote; Why I'm not Orthodox, 'Christianity today, Jan. 6, 1997', made his case based on some petrified Orthodox practices.<br /><br />Clendenin has included a balanced selection of topics from some outstanding Eastern (Byzantine) theologians, who happened to be mostly Russian: Florovsky, Lossky, Meyendroff, and Schmemann. His selection from Greek theologians was short of Zizioulis, Staniloae, and others. He may have never heard of eminent Orintals like Metropolitan G. Khedr, or Fr. Matthew the poor, Abbot of St. Makarius.<br /><br />The issues are very well selected and the chapters cover a full integral roaster of topics. Since the editor is Evangelical he skillfully included most of the issues of particular concern to Protestants, covering everything from the importance of the liturgy to the role of sacraments and Orthodox stances on the nature of God and such issues on salvation as Theosis (deification), the Eucharist, intercession of saints, praying with icons, and hesitant ecumenical relations with the Romans, and at least upper Church Protestantism.<br /><br />Orthodox Theology:<br /><br />As a lay theologian interested in learning what the neo-Orthodox are to say, I came to know, specially Fr. Lev Gilet of St. Serge, in Paris who was very influential in the revival of Orthodox Youth movement in the Middle east. Although I am reservedly fascinated with 'Byzantine' ontological theology yet this is remote from authentic Orthodoxy, the spirit of the desert fathers and their mysticism. Prof. Thomas Torrance expresses it well: the knowledge of God comes through the remarriage of Ontology with Epistemology. Surprisingly, they have never been divorced in the ultimate Alexandro-Antiochian Orthodoxy. Some of these articles may look somewhat controversial; that is because Oriental and Eastern Orthodoxy has a minimum of dogmatics, leaving more space for personal views, united by the long patristic tradition, since there is no strict doctrinal control in the traditional archaic sense.<br /><br />Orthodox theology rooted in Alexandria cataphatic based allegory, biblical mysticism garnished with Skete's practical Christianity of partaking in divine nature (Theosis), through ego mortification to self forgiveness, and being in continuing presence of the Lord, in praying unceasingly the arrow prayer of Macarius (adopted as the Jesus prayer): this is the only authentic Orthodox Mystical theology of sharing our being in Christ Victor.<br /><br />Controversial Orthodoxy?<br /><br />An Amazon.com reviewer guessed \\"whether this book is fair representation of Orthodox thinking. I happen to know that some of the authors and opinions are controversial in Orthodox circles.\\" While, \\"studentofislamichistory\\" adds that, \\"Perhaps it is hard to avoid controversy in modern theology.\\" Whether this book represents a full spectrum of contemporary Orthodox theological thought? Although few of the authors are out of the main stream conservatives, their opinions are not controversial but complementary. Saying so, I could be no less critical of some of the marginally expressed views.odox theological thought?

In the East it started as a monastic office, in St. Pachom'ius' cenobitic Agpiya or Horologion, whose Basilica version was preserved in Bishop Serapion Horologion, now in the British Museum.<br /><br />The Cyrillic rule of prayer, \\"Pray to The Father, with the name of The Son, in The Holy Spirit\\" by St. Cyril, the pillar of faith, a Doctor of the Catholic Church, is here expressed in the Trinitarian devotion. It starts rightly with thanksgiving reflecting the ancient Roman Alexandrian fellowship from Athanasius to Cyril. The Christian life is a vocation of continuos unceasing prayer, which this small book intends to inspire you to share in every occasion.<br /><br />Prayer and prayers:<br /><br />The Jesus prayer is a strong sign of the ecumenical trend of the Roman Church towards the Catholic or Universal Church, as a friend of mine insists our Lord asked to gather His mystical body, this is his message to be One. The Jesus prayer was the Lords own on the Publicans thought:\\" Lord have mercy on me a sinner, Kyria Elaison. St. Macarius called it \\"the arrow prayer\\", his disciple Evagrius Ponticus carried it with him, same way John Cassian, carried with him the Pachomian tradition into south France, where the Benedectine continued the way.<br /><br />Introducing, 'The Western Rite':<br /><br />\\"Sacraments and the Divine Office preserve a similar, direct, clear-cut outline. In the West as in the East, the sanctification of man's activities has been the subject of a considerable ritual development, with blessings available for all manner of things and occasions. The Western Divine Office (Horologion), like the Eucharist, is adaptable to varying degrees of solemnity from choral performance with chant to private recitation. Tidy groups of psalms together with hymns, brief Scripture lessons, versicles and prayers are assigned to each of the day hours.\\"  (the Rt.

Emphasizing that which is in humanity common to both minister and believer, this woundedness can serve as a source of strength and healing when counseling others.\\" from Edit. Rev.<br /><br />The wounded review:<br /><br />Writing this review was as hard as delivering baby Henri Nouwen, it coincided with global devastation due the atrocities taking place in the world, and in His holy mystical body. I am writing a recap on six reviews, each of which captured a side of the book and the psyche of its wounded author, beloved late Fr. Nouwen. Trained in Holland as a psychologist and a theologian, Nouwen spent his later years as a conference speaker. He taught at Yale, Harvard, and Notre Dame, writing more than one book a year, and travelling widely.<br /><br />Wounded Healers:<br /><br />St. Paul, the arch-wounded healer, told us about \\"a thorn was given me in the Flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me\\"<br /><br />Fr. Nouwen's wound was in his psyche and masterfully does Philip Yancey describe it in his article, in Christianity today, 1966: \\"The Holy Inefficiency Of Henri Nouwen\\" in this story, \\"Richard Foster and Eugene Peterson mentioned an intense young man who had been seeking spiritual direction from both of them. They responded as best they could, answering questions by mail and recommending books on spirituality. Foster had just learned that the same inquirer had also contacted Henri Nouwen. \\"You won't believe what Nouwen did,\\" he said. \\"He invited this stranger to live with him for a month so he could mentor him in person.\\"<br /><br />Doctor, Heal Thyself:<br /><br />It seems this echoed in Henri's mind when at Cambridge, MA, he started writing the book. As Cry-the-Name (rev 6) rightly mentioned, Prof. Nouwen was in the Ivy ivory tower of Harvard, but he possibly referred to a real experience in: Ministry to a hopeless Man, while he served as a minister in or around Utrecht in his late twenties. Again the title may have been born in his own conscience in Topeka or South Bend, a psychology teacher could not have missed similarity of Franz Jung life to his own.<br /><br />\\"He (Henri Nouwen) had a resume to die for which was the problem, exactly. The pressing schedule and relentless competition were suffocating his own spiritual life.\\" Philip Yancey<br /><br />Healers Wounds:<br /><br />How all six reviewers observed the healer and his wounds from different prespectives, is evident in Michael Ford's Biography of Henri Nouwen, \\"Nouwen was a prophet to millions of people who heard him speak and read his books, but he also was wounded in so many ways. His life was one of paradox and pain. Nouwen, for example knew some 1,500 people he counted as personal friends, yet he constantly struggled with intense feelings of loneliness.\\" He announced as a wounded healer: \\"The master is coming-not tomorrow, but today, not next year, but this year, not after all our misery is passed, but in the middle of it, not in another place but right here where we are standing\\"( Ministry by a lonely minister)<br /><br />Nuclear Man's ways to liberation:<br /><br />Both Nouwen and Merton have similar backgrounds; since both lived in post second World war Europe, got benchmark European education, amended with exposure to great American Academia; they are both Nuclear men, global believers, imitating Christ in different ways. According to J. Donders; they were invoked to their vocation in different ways, and encountered their spiritual adventure in kids like awe, both torn apart, but stayed whole. Their mind and milieu are alike although their wounds were categorically different.<br /><br />Quotations For the Wounded:<br /><br />\\"Christianity is not just challenged to ask itself to a modern age, but is also challenged to ask itself whether its unarticulated suppositions can still form the basis for its redemptive pretensions\\"( Nuclear Man)<br /><br />\\"I am afraid that in a few decades, the Church will be accused of having failed in its most basic task: to offer men creative ways to communicate with the source of human life.\\" (Ministry for a rootless generation)<br /><br />\\"In this analysis it has became clear that Christian leadership is accomplished only through service\\" (ministry to a hopeless man)id that in a few decades, the Church will be accused of having failed in its most basic task: to offer men creative ways to communicate with the source of human life.\\" (Ministry for a rootless generation) <br />\\"In this analysis it has became clear that Christian leadership is accomplished only through service\\" (ministry to a hopeless man) <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

How is M. Fox expressing his vision, quoting biblical themes from infancy narratives, of all four Gospels, viewing Jesus life as revealing Cosmic unity in his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension is relatively unique in contemporary western theology. He keeps assuring the novel reader that he follow the steps of creation mystics and oriental Church fathers. He mentions the recent writing of Jaroslav Pelikan of Yale, the most prominent doctrine development theologian, who devotes a chapter to the Cosmic Christ who gives meaning to the Cosmos, redeeming its divine order and revelation.<br /><br />Now Matthew Fox, a Dominican Creation Mystic in the Book's following chapters concludes that the Cosmic Christ is the title for the crucified and resurrected, whose paschal mystery is the prefigured salvation in the Old Testament, even more relevant for third millennium Christianity, redeems redemption of mother earth, and of cosmic pain, reveals the divine in all creation!<br /><br />So far, so good. His conclusive vision in Part V, mostly in extrapolation of Vatican II; in redeeming of Worship, and deepening of Ecumenism but stays ahead of me, and many, in renaissance of sexual mysticism and artistic creativity.<br /><br />Mystic Matthew Fox:<br /><br />Fr. Matthew Fox, a Dominican thinker, became closely linked to Eastern Church mystical theology through his search on western medieval mystics, Meister Eckhart, Hildegard of Bingen, whose spirituality and its apophatic terminology was rooted in mystical expression. His 'Passion for Creation' and 'Sheer Joy', asserts revelation of compassion as the central theme of Christianity  in 'A Spirituality Named Compassion', and his culmination in Original Blessing, of an antithesis of 'Original Sin' doctrine added to his alliance with liberation and feminist tone theologies, made him suspect of Vatican's guardians of faith.<br /><br />Mysticism Expert's View:<br /><br />Jon Zuck comments that, Matthew Fox's Christian mysticism is to change our souls and our world. \\"This book is almost certainly the most comprehensive on what a modern mystical Christian worldview can be, and one of the most comprehensive books I've seen on anything, period. There are plenty of books on the trends of evil in this world system, plenty of calls for peacemaking, plenty of appeals for spiritual renewal, but Cosmic Christ addresses all these issues and more, with information, insight, and inspiration.\\" He concludes, \\"Yet The Coming of theCosmic Christ is the one almost certainly to be remembered as his masterpiece.\\"c Christ is the one almost certainly to be remembered as his masterpiece.\\" <br />	2005-07-10

Since I was brought up in Alexandria where salvation is by Grace through knowledge, thinking was never stood in the way of faith. Some of the greatest Church thinkers; Origen, Athanasius, and Cyril utilized their faculty in defending Orthodoxy, after developing Saccha's Christianity compatable Neo-Platonism.<br /><br />Renewing the Mind:<br /><br />Jim Sire describes Intellectual Life As a Christian Calling, while John Cobb, Jr. challenging all Christians to think, in obedience of Christ. And while Cobb asks Christians to reclaim their gift of thinking, and redeem thinking about God from theologians, Williams defines the life of the mind as a Christian perspective.<br /><br />In a A Review of The Life of the Mind, Learning to Think Like a Christian is the reviewer T. Moore's qualifying subtitle, he underlines with John Stott that, 'Your Mind Matters', reminds us that, 'disciplined development of the mind must be an important part of every Christian's spiritual life.'<br /><br />Thinking, life of the Mind:<br /><br />Dr. Clifford Williams, a veteran professor of philosophy, at Trinity College offers an examination of the life of the mind, as a Christian perspective, in seven chapters that constitute his brief, but informing book. Christians who develop their mind's life observe, think, and engage in dialogue. They are interested in the exploration of mundane knowledge (science and philosophy) and spiritual knowledge that enhances their faith.<br /><br />Williams believes that people of faith has to be thinkers, and sets in a concise and systematic way the case for his theme.  While it is normal to think, developing and utilizing our mental faculties, consistently and coherency, is a matter of discipline, very much like the desert fathers toil with the Noia (thought).  While Williams argues that thinking is sought for its own merits, he argues that our minds will try their ways around issues until they can achieve solutions, and acquiring good thinking habits will motivate thinking processes and make them enjoyable. He cites the Scriptures to support his argument, of not wasting what the Lord intended in His intelligent design. He claims that knowledge on its own merits is a way of loving God (John 17:3).

His integral consideration of the major theological basis of orthodox Christianity, the Trinity, Christology, sacramental theology, and eschatology but it is through the Eucharist, that the Metropolitan renews with a fresh understanding, Alexandrine Soteriology and Cyril's Eucharist centered ecclessiology of the one Person of Christ visited by Luther and Barth. He considers the local church as integrally catholic, in this sense. For Zizioulas, the Church Universal is the communion of all Churches, Catholic, Evangelical, and Orthodox.<br /><br />Trinitarian Communion:<br /><br />The author represents an ontology of the St. Cyril Orthodox expression of Trinitarian doctrine. He shows in a systematic theology how the unity of the Trinity is within the Trinitarian personshood of the Godhead. Western theology, considers the essence first in its approach to the Mystery. This book cuts through dogmas of ecclesiastical divisions and reaches for the patristic understanding, by asking questions that matter, from the very life of the Heavenly triune God, who in his self revelation, invites his believing sons and daughters to be in communion, sustained through His Holy spirit.<br /><br />How is the Trinitarian communion defined, and ecclessiastical fellowship experienced within the life of the Church, and the teaching of the Gospels?

But rather than its emphasizes on the infallibility of Scripture, salvation, the cross, and, conversion, Nicene Christianity, is represented as the task for the Christian faithful and Ecumenical Church to witnesses and actively engage with the 'Good News', the Father's revelation in the Gospel of Jesus.

Everything he writes, from his invaluable The Other Bible, a compendium of holy texts no writer should be without, through his brilliant translations and beautiful poems, is a breathtaking achievement.\\"  Carolyn Kizer<br /><br />Other Bible?<br />While there are many other books that could be described as inspired in east and west, 'The Other Bible' limits its scope to Jewish, intertestamental, Christian, and Gnostic writings presented as religious thought free of doctrinal stricture, and recently availed their amazing beauty, that is so brisk and thrilling. Most of texts in this collection are from third century BC to fourth AD. In addition to a sampler of Hermes Trismegistus, Kabbalah' Zohar, with a most inspiring works; the mystical theology of the Syriac Pseudo-Dionysius and the Enneads of the brilliant pagan Neoplatonist Alexandrine Copt. Salvation and ascension into the Lords presence, has been a typical obsession of those text authors, of whom the Therapeutae and Essene may have been contenders for the larger 'Alexandrine Canon' of the Septuagint Codices. Meanwhile, the mileu of Alexandrine science, philosophy and allegory may have produced a most fascinating spectrum of logical, imaginative, and mystical thought.<br /><br />Appetizing Sampler:<br />\\"The dew of the Lord rinsed me with silence<br />and a cloud of peace rose over my head, ...<br />I spread my hands out as my soul pointed to the firmament<br />and I slipped upward to him who redeemed me.\\"(The Odes of Solomon)<br /><br />\\"But this is not that wooden cross which you shall see when you go down from here; nor am I the man who is on the cross, I whom now you do not see but only hear my voice. I was taken to be what I am not, I who am not what for many others I was;... much more shall I, the Lord of this place, be neither seen or told.\\"  (Revelation of the Mystery of the Cross)<br /><br />\\"He answered: 'This is what I have heard.

Pink, asked this obviously logical question, in his answer he says; \\"While the four Evangelists have much in common, each has much that is peculiar to himself, and it is in noting their variations that we are brought to see their true meaning and scope and to appreciate their perfections. In carefully reading through the four Gospels it soon becomes apparent to any reflecting mind that in none of them, nor in the four together, do we have anything approaching a complete biography of our Savior's earthly ministry. There are great gaps in His life which none of the Evangelists profess to fill in. Even when we come to the accounts of His public ministry it is clear that the records are but fragmentary; the Evangelists select only portions of His teachings and describe in detail but a few of His miracles. John gives us some idea when he says, \\"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written\\" (John 21:25).\\"<br /><br />Why four Gospels?<br />The four Gospels are so many books, each complete in itself, written with a distinctive design, and that which is included in its pages, and all that is left out, is strictly subordinated to that design, according to a principle of selection. In other words, nothing whatever is brought into any one of the Gospels save that which was strictly relevant and pertinent to its peculiar theme and subject, and all that was irrelevant and failed to illustrate and exemplify its theme was excluded. The same plan of selection is noticeable in every section of the Holy Scriptures. (...)<br /><br />Hays' Bimillennium Diatessaron:<br />An important principle has been established re 'Diatessaronic-type' gospel harmonies by a number of scholars, such as Petersen, Quispel, and Boismard, viz., these harmonies often preserve ancient readings. The best-known harmony is Tatian's Diatessaron. It is believed to have been created ca 175, although many questions remain to what extent it was a new work, and what exactly Tatian's own contribution was. It is clear that Tatian was relying on a previous harmony, may be that of his Master, Jerome, so perhaps his own contribution was quite minor. After two thousand years of the mission of the son of man, in the Y2K hyperspace era, Edward hays specifies how, and why the Gabriel inspired version of his book, 'A Life of Jesus the Christ', \\"As with the writings of the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the good news according to Gabriel has 'selected certain things' out of the four Gospels; 'synthesized' other accounts and teachings, 'with an eye ' or two open toward today's spiritual landscape.\\"<br /><br />Hays Sanctifying Fiction:<br />A watershed work on Jesus that is poignant and practical, concludes Frederic & Mary Ann Brussat in their review of Hays celebrated fiction of Gospel narrative. \\"This is a poetic, passionate, and deeply spiritual portrait of the man from Nazareth and his guardian angel messenger. In a wilderness encounter with his ancestors, Jesus learns that \\"by being full of God, you will be full of an inner beauty that will seduce many to fall madly in love with God.\\" The prophet-poet on these pages is led by \\"the Spirit Wind\\" to proclaim God's time in action, thought, word, and deed. He squares off with his shadow; builds bridges between people; includes women in his \\"little family\\"; learns from pain; helps others to see themselves as God sees them; celebrates the mystery of life; travels lightly; affirms dancing, sex, and creativity; enables his disciples to create great memories; feasts on love; and is transformed after death into the Risen Jesus - the New Adam.\\"<br /><br />The FifthEvangelist:<br />John Pilch, Professor at Georgetown University, a biblical scholar, and author of 'The cultural World of Jesus,' declares, \\"The Gospel of Gabriel qualifies Ed Hays, America's best theological storywriter, to become the fifth evangelist.\\"<br />This poetic prose composed by Fr.

Even the title reflects this, as if there were an 8th ecumenical council ! \\" ( John Q. Public , West Lafayette, Indiana)<br /><br />The Church councils:<br />The Church held councils to resolve issues when non Conclave dialogue failed to come to a consensus. Most councils were local, although in some cases their decrees gained wide acceptance. The first council of the Church, referred to in Acts 6:1-7, was held by the Apostles in Jerusalem during the church first decades. It was Constantine who sought a Church synod with a similar Roman senate procedure and authority.<br /><br />Seven General Councils:<br />The first General Councils of the entire Christian Church, acknowledged by the eastern church are known as the seven Ecumenical Councils. They were convened, by imperial edicts between 325-757 AD to solve conflicts or verify Orthodox belief, putting into force their doctrines and administrative directions. At these Ecumenical Councils many Canons, or laws governing the administration of the Church, that form the main existing canons of the orthodox Church were composed. Fundamental Christian doctrines, accepted by both the Eastern and Western Churches, were mostly reached in the first four, which Protestants positively consider. The decisions of these Ecumenical Councils were made under the direction of the imperial power, sometimes with heavy pressure from imperial representatives for the benefit of the political unity of Byzantium.<br /><br />The Ecumenical Councils:<br />Even if councils were declared ecumenical (universal), this is not the case when the three founding Patriarchate were not represented, (in order: Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, Constantinople and Jerusalem added later on). Furthermore contradiction of major dogmatic themes nullify them, and non acceptance by the main Churches put them in doubt. That is why the two ancient Oriental churches Alexandria and Antioch, only count the first three as ecumenical, anathematizing Chalcedon as the Council of schism. Meanwhile, the acceptance of the canons is not matching between churches. Roman Catholics regard councils as canonical (binding) only when a pope has subsequently ratified them, besides, canons of several councils have never been accepted by Rome as canon 28 of Chalcedon. Protestants recognize the authority of only the first four councils, although as first expressed by Martin Luther, do not regard neither councils nor their canons as binding, unless council decisions are in accordance with scripture, do Protestants consider them canonical.<br /><br />First Seven Church Councils:<br />Fr. Leo Davis book is an overview of the Councils' history and theological milieu. The seven ecumenical councils dealt with, in which ecclesiastic decisions took place are the councils of Nicea I, Constantinople I, Ephesus, Chalcedon, Constantinople II, Constantinople III and Nicea II. If you are verifying for fine details, you have to examine it in comparison with the 'Early Church Fathers', volume on the Councils. In his condensed book Dr. Davis, SJ tries to synthesize an objective view, based on Roman Catholic dogma, of the history of the Church and the theological details encountered in all seven ecumenical councils meetings.<br />After a socio-political introduction, where he introduced the Roman world, he appropriated a chapter to each council; the circumstances that led to the council, convening of the council, a summary of deliberations, the outcome and resonance of the council. The life of the Church during these councils was much related with the social and political history of the empire, in Fr. Meyendroff's words: \\"Imperial unity and Christian Divisions,\\" were often interacting. The ecclesiastical rivalries were at the bottom of some of the enduring problems that formed most emperors into able theologians.<br /><br />Author Leo D. Davis:<br />The Jesuit Fr. integrated his theological learning in the Gregorian University, Rome, with a Ph. D. from one of the best schools in 'secular' history, but amended that by reference to authorities on eastern Christian history. He has been influenced by some of the corrupted theological and Christological views  which have been recently corrected by eminent Catholic theologians, but this does not mean the book is less than outstanding.ologians.

Viviano (Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Moses Beholder of God Vs Jesus Word of God	\\"We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth?\\" (Jn: 1.45)<br /><br />Beholders of God:<br />The Johannine Christ has been claimed to be both the most human (Son of man, Prophet) and the divine (One with the father) representations given by all four evangelists. The comparison with the prophetic office of Moses is very clear in the Church of Alexandria, established early by the Jewish Therapeutae who believed St. Mark's preaching of Jesus the expected Messiah. Mark's own special title, preserved in the Coptic rite, is \\"St. Mark, the Beholder of God,\\" which makes of the evangelist a parallel to Moses, with regard to the direct divine revelation of the truth of the gospel, which replaced the Law.<br /><br />Moses' Law and Christ's Gospel:<br />The New Testament places the law of Moses and the gospel of Jesus Christ in a typological continuum. So far from contrasting Jesus and Moses in any absolute fashion, New Testament writers clearly portray Jesus as the new and greater Moses. In Jesus, the person and work of Moses are perfected and escalated. Jesus is the prophet like Moses that God promised to send his people. His cross accomplishes a greater exodus (Lk. 9:31), rescuing the covenant people from sin and death (the greater Pharaoh). Jesus in the church, fulfills the typology of the tabernacle and sacrifice that Moses devised. Matthew's entire gospel revolves around the theme of Jesus, the fulfillment of Moses' ministry. Other gospels combine with Matthew in echoing Mosaic themes as well: Both Moses and Jesus are delivered from Egypt (Ex. 1-2 and Mt. 1-2), both escape the bloody plot of a tyrant in their infancy (Pharaoh and Herod), both survive the wilderness (Moses for forty years, Jesus for forty days), growing in wisdom (Acts 7:22 with Lk. 2:52) Jesus issued blessings and Moses curses from a mountain (Dt. 28 and Mt. 5:1), both demonstrated signs and wonders and were transfigured on a mountain. Both presented Israel with a choice between two ways (Dt. 30:1& Mt. 7:24-27), performed sea crossings and wilderness feedings (Ex. 14 & Jn. 6:15) While Moses provided manna from heaven and water from the rock Jesus gave bread to the multitudes and wine in Cana , his first miracle (mentioned only by John)<br /><br />Moses and Jesus:<br />a. Moses is one of the chief witnesses to Jesus, there is no polemic against Moses, but rather no comparison. Catholic NT Scholars ascribes the importance of the Moses-theme as opposed to the Davidic-Messiah-theme to the Samaritan tradition in Jn, since the Samaritans rejected the Davidic Messiah and concentrated on Moses the Prophet.<br />b. Jesus is the Prophet whom Moses prophesied about, announced in Dt 18.18: 'we have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law' (1.45). The two crucified with Jesus are in Jn not called thieves, but are simply one on either side, as the supporters of Moses as he prayed to save his people in battle This is popular opinion, is the same theme of speaking not of himself but as God sent him (Jn 8.28; 12.49-50), to speak God's Word; he brings life, as Moses did (Dt 30.19-20; Jn 5.24); he works signs, especially three numbered signs, to occasion belief (Ex 4.1-9; Jn 2.1-11.)<br />c. Jesus' gift is superior to that of Moses. The Law through Moses, grace and truth through Jesus Christ (1.18). Moses gave bread in the desert, but Jesus is the true Bread from Heaven (6); he gave water from the Rock, but Jesus is the living water. In chapter 7 the emphasis is on teaching: Jesus completes the Law, which Moses taught only partially. The Jews must finally make a choice between being followers of Moses or of Jesus (9.28.) Moses, therefore, is one of the chief means by which John shows who Jesus is, or what he means.<br /><br />Moses Vs Jesus Studies:<br />There has been a big number of studies on the fourth Gospel of which few have chosen Boismard's venue. He is a leading Johannine scholar who emphasized \\"the prophet-like-Moses who is Divine Wisdom, his Christology is provocative though biblical. Even for christology readers, this book represents a challenging reading. The late Fr. Raymond Brown, SS, a Johannine Expert himself, wrote; \\"Boismard is one of the premier Johannine scholars of this century.\\"<br /><br />* Thomas, Cherian.

This time, however, there is a polemical agenda: Barton rejects fundamentalist doctrines of biblical authority, as well as all proposals that the shaping of the canon has normative hermeneutical status.\\" Richard B. Hays<br /><br />Authority of the Book:<br /><br />It was in the most unlikely place, that this book has captured my attention; in the cellar of Marshall Fields department store on State St., Chicago, IL, 15 years ago. There is an Arabic saying; \\"A book is read through its head Title,\\" which implies that a message of a valid argument is evident in its heading. Barton's essay is a good example in this case. Striken by the contrast of an informed generality with the specificifity of Biblical authority in Christianity, I picked the slim blue paperback from the bookstand, and read through its eight articles, that with a forward and biography describe the book contents:<br /><br />1. The Bible in the Christian Faith<br /><br />2. Prophecy and Fulfillment<br /><br />3. The Question of the Canon<br /><br />4. The Bible as Evidence<br /><br />5. The Bible as Theology<br /><br />6.

The Word of God and Word of Man<br /><br />Contemporary Issues:<br /><br />Following on my previous review of \\"Issues of Life & Death,\\" it was logical to find out why some supporters of life could go all the way to shoot abortion doctors. John Barton initiates his discussion with a statement, \\"Many who find biblicistic forms of Christianity appealing are also people of strikingly attractive character, with a worm and living faith. That being so, it seems unlikely that the arguments to which they appeal are simply empty. Over the years a suspicion has grown in me that much of the fundamentalists' case is not simply a bad thing, but a good thing gone wrong: they point us towards important truth, but veer away from them themselves at the last moment because a doctrinaire conservatism blinds their eyes.\\"<br /><br />This is how the able author of \\"Reading the Old Testament: Method in Biblical Study\\" following on the 'stimulus provided by the writings of James Barr's works on the bible, its canon and authority and his infamous, 'Beyond Fundamentalism' introduces his own argument. He formulates his debate in two questions:<br /><br />- What is the relation between our knowledge of God and the Bible which thus mysteriously seems to nourish this knowledge in us?<br /><br />- How should Christians think of the Bible?<br /><br />Barton's Thematic Approach:<br /><br />\\"Pride of place must go to the conservative belief that the earliest Christians, and indeed Jesus himself, must be the arbiters of any Christian doctrine of Scripture,\\" preludes the author of his concern in the first chapter's essay. He then discusses the idea of prophecy and fulfillment, its most specific example. Then, he concentrates on the authority of the Old Testament for contemporary believers. The canon which shaped the books of the Bible and the tradition alongside are then discussed in relation with 'the basic teachings of Christianity' The remaining chapters deal with consequential issues: The Bible as a book of faith, hermeneutical meaning of Scripture, and the bible in worship.<br /><br />Dr. Barton sums up his arguments about the Bible as the source of authority for Christian faith in two propositions: It is not primarily the Bible that is the Word of God, but Jesus Christ.

He utilizes the next three chapters 8-10 to prepare for his book's core, starting with the relation of king and prophet in Egypt and Mesopotamia, to Hebrew kingship, integration of religion and the common good, and evolution of the prophetic concept of sin and judgment, the eternal dynasty of David, the futuristic concepts of kingdom, its inauguration, the Gospel, eschatology, and salvation.<br /><br />In the next chapters 12 to 16 he masterfully exposes Hebrew Wisdom, Mystery of inequity, life and death, Jewish prayer: The Psalms, and surveyed the opinions on the holy, and God of the Hebrews, and divine love.<br /><br />Old Testament & Christianity:<br /><br />In his final chapter ; 'The Old and New' he reviews the unsettled relation between the OT and Christianity, the unity and continuity of the two Testaments, an accepted Church doctrine, but rather the meaning of this unity.<br /><br />He concludes commenting; \\"We have heard, in sadness and bewilderment, many who say that they fear the Old Testament because it raises doubts in their minds.

Meanwhile, the first great systematic theologian, is reckoned by most as Origen of Alexandria, who invented the word theologia, even if he constructs on the foundations of Clement, in late second century Alexandria, who wrote a substantial trilogy of which Paedagogus an ethical guide, and Stromateis which he wrote to provide biblical themes in the language of Greek philosophers, paved the way of his grand scheme. (p. 166)<br /><br />Introducing Theology:<br />Charles Lowry novel account of New Testament theological trilogy, needed his enlightening exposition, an acclimatizing introduction in the first three chapters. He starts by outlining the historical, cultural, and faith issues that forced the church of 'a dying and rising God who had actually lived among men,' out of the synagogue whose TaNaKh was 'often more a problem than an asset,' to the Graeco-Gentiles that then dominated the new Testament faithful.<br /><br />Early Theological Resources:<br />Here, as eight years later, in his synonym book (Eerdmans, 94) was Princeton President Gillespie influenced by Harnack's 'Didache,' Lowry expresses his fear of being influenced by the same great dogmatic.

Not being a static body of doctrines, but an evolving, integral life in Christ, Church existence in space and time, has to be enriched by history of revelation, faith and Apostolic tradition, of service and preaching. This means that; its past is not just a matter of fact. Dean Erickson implies that, \\"Christians are obliged to take seriously the problem of historical change. They must reflect on what gives the Church its identity in time and space, even in the midst of change.\\"<br /><br />Ericson's Panarion:<br />In this diversified collection of essays, delivered on various occassions by John Erickson, that investigates the ways in which concepts and issues relating to the Church's life have developed in the past and continue to challenge us in the present. Underlying all the essays is the conviction that the Church cannot be adequately understood without reference to tradition. But as Erickson shows, discerning this tradition, and its significance for the Church today, is not an easy task. Tradition, he asserts, is not just another word for Church history. It is not a neat collection of precedents from the past which can provide the answer to every contemporary problem. Rather, tradition \\"reveals the Spirit at work in both past, and thereby to respond to the challenge of the present.\\"<br /><br />Canonical Orthodoxy:<br />In reaction to those presented issues, some faithful take as their point of departure certain dogmas; \\"The triumph of Orthodoxy,\\" as the restoration of icons in private and liturgical praying, rather than reaching for others in charity. Expressions like \\"Everything in the Church is Tradition, including the Gospel,\\" by Nicepor, or unorthodox inaudible praying, a non canonical late practice, and the role of priesthood, rather than, a meaningful committed apostolate service.<br />Others examine, in historical perspective, the issues dividing 'Orthodox' Christians of East and Orient; they discuss not only the ways by which universal Orthodox Church's unity and continuity have been perceived and expressed over the last few decades, but also the problems of disunity and discontinuity, still expressed in part in the 'rabid use' of outdated Byzantine expressions like 'heretic and schismatic' for their own kin's, and the real defenders of Orthodoxy, Armenians, Copts, and Syrians, whose meaning and resonance have significantly shifted over the centuries since the schism. Erickson has yet quoted (p.137) an uninformed 'Nicetas Stethatus', who by joining the Miaphysite own fathers and teachers: Dioscorus, Severus, and Sergius, with Apollinaris and Eutycheus, is more grave than the 'leavened bread debate.'<br /><br />Why I'm not Orthodox?<br />Daniel Clendenin, an Evangelical expert on Eastern Orthodoxy, who knows enough to amaze most of the Orthodox Eastern and Orientals, is on InterVarsity staff at Stanford University. Clendenin who proved authentic and knowledgeable of petrified Orthodox practices when he wrote; Why I'm not Orthodox, Christianity today, Jan. 6, 1997. Clendenin's view of basic Eastern & Byzantine Orthodoxy needs to be addressed by Dean Erickson, in Book's revised edition. The outsider  view on petrified rituals think that a more informed laity capable of exploring changes in expression of words and images used to present mysteries like absolving sins, rather than Lord's direct forgiveness, or use of novel practices of the Byzantine Church, even if marginal, Liturgical innovations like the 'Royal Doors', that Jesus Christ has removed, even any veils, between God and his people.<br /><br />Renewal of Orthodoxy:<br/>I came to know, and admire, Fr. Lev Gilet who was very influential in the revival of both Eastern and Oriental Orthodox movement in the Middle east, and Dean Erickson should find how young American Orthodox, could be equally inspired, in spite of Canons. The Neo-Orthodox of St. Serge, Fr. Schmemann, and Fr. Meyendorff, who both by analyzing those same ailments, have led the revival in North America. I heartily recommend this collection of essays as a broad introductory reading into the vision of Eastern Orthodox Dogmatic, liturgical, and Canonical teachings. While Saying so, I could be no less critical of some of the expressed views, and quotations of some alleged Orthodox Fathers of the Church.<br /><br />Controversial Orthodoxy?<br />Whether this book, in its diversified spectrum, is a start of other genuine modern Orthodox views, even if shy, in spite of, the traditional 'Greek' suspicion of 'any born again Orthodox' and the controversial resistance to ecclesiastical reformation covering everything from the spiritual role of liturgy, even when the practice of 'presanctified Gifts Liturgy' is presented as Gregory's rather than Severus' of Antioch, after being proven by Prof. N. Uspensky in; 'Evening Worship', and the records of the Catholic and Coptic Church.<br />The issues that are left out are; mystical meaning of sacraments and Orthodox stances on the nature of God and such issues as Kenosis, Synergy, and Theosis (deification), in salvation, the meaning of intercession of saints, praying with icons. this will liberate Orthodox from the hesitant attitude in ecumenical relations with the Romans, and at least upper Church Protestantism.<br /><br />So What is Orthodoxy?<br />Although I am reservedly fascinated with 'Byzantine' ontological theology yet this is remote from authentic Orthodoxy, the spirit of the desert fathers and their mysticism. Prof. Thomas Torrance expresses it well: the knowledge of God comes through the remarriage of Ontology with Epistemology. Surprisingly, they have never been divorced in real Orthodoxy of practical Christianity; partaking in divine nature, and being in the continuous presence of the Lord, unceasingly through prayer. This is the only authentic Orthodoxy of sharing our being in Christ Victor. Alas Orthodoxy is very much buried in Canons and rituals, although meticulously conserved like Saints relics, and petrified in iconography, incense, candles, etc. Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy are supposed to keep less dogmatic baggage, leaving more space for personal piety, united by the long patristic tradition, since there is no strict doctrinal control in the traditional archaic sense.<br /><br />Dean Erickson:<br />John H. Erickson is Dean and Professor of Canon Law and Church History at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary.

Contemporary views widely patronized by Egyptologists, tracing the name back to the Egyptian mesh (child), is dominating but nothing could be established as decisive.<br /><br />*Monotheism:(Gk. monon: single, Theos: Deity.) the belief in a single, an all-encompassing universal, deity.<br /><br />*Monolatry: The worship of only one god, while admitting the existence of other gods.<br /><br />What is Your Name?<br /><br />There are many Jews & Christians alike, who are upset by Martin Buber's interpretation of Moses inquiring from YAHWEH, as showing the influence of the Egyptian 'name magic.' This may have been the reason beyond the strange inquiry of the learned Moses, who may have asked the encountered God of the 'Unconsumed Bush' for His identifying name, and the Lord's mysterious answer, explained in 'The Egyptian Book of the Dead in which (?)-Moses could have been initiated into by the priests of the solar cult of Heliopolis, whose predominant cosmological world view, Moses has presented in the book of Genesis, describes multiple names for Atum, Master of its divine Pantheon, and creator deity, \\"whose name has been variously interpreted as meaning 'the Completed One,' 'He Who is Entirity,'...or 'The Undifferentiated One.' the last rendering seems the most probable.., i.e., an undifferentiated unity,\\" (The Book of Going Forth by Day, translation by Dr. Raymond Faulklner, with introduction & commentaries by Dr. Ogden Goelet)<br /><br />Freud's Moses:<br /><br />In his last written book, completed just before the holocaust, Freud was not the first to argue that Moses was an Egyptian Prince, and that the Hebrew religion that developed into monotheistic Judaism was but an adapted Egyptian thought carried back into Palestine.

It was, humanly speaking, an indispensable providence that represented him in the Transfiguration, side by side with Elias, and quite inferior to the incomparable Antitype whose coming he had predicted.\\" New Advent<br /><br />Assmann's Moses:<br /><br />Assmann starts with a parapsychological definition of Egyptian thought construction as Mnemo-history, advancing into Suppressed history of Repressed memory of Akhenaten in Moses conscience, proceeding to Spencer's findings as 'before the Law.' The crux of his advancement to his ultimate thesis lies in a historical review of eighteenth century discourse on Moses.

(Prayer of Manasseh 11-13)<br /><br />Apocrypha & Deuterocanonicals:<br />Apocrypha means 'hidden things' (in Greek). The Apocryphal books of the Bible fall into two categories: texts which were included at some point in some canonical version of the Bible, and other texts of a Biblical nature which have never been canonical. Those are compositions which profess to have been written either by Biblical personages or men in intimate relations with them.<br />Deutero means behind, or further from, these books called 'Deuterocanonical,' mean 'books added to the canon.' Deutrocanonical books of the Bible are those of or constituting a second or subsequent canon, books which are included in some version of the canonical Bible, but which have been excluded at one time or another, for textual or doctrinal issues.<br />Most of Old Testament Apocrypha are part of the wider Alexandrian canon of the OT, known as the Septuaguint (Seventy translators). OT books discovered within the Dead Sea Scrolls has confirmed the authenticity and contents of fourth century Alexandrian unicials, ex. Codex Sinaiticus.<br />Psalm 151, in spite of its inclusion in Orthodox liturgy for centuries, has only been included in 'The Harper Collins NRSV,' 1989 edition, after its discovery and confirmation in the Hebrew Psalter, within Qumran's cave 11 discovery.<br /><br />The Mutilated Bible:<br />It is true that \\"the Apocrypha is an endless source of fascination for the scholar and lay reader of scriptural texts.\\" It is also valid to state that they are canonical for two thirds of Christians, (Orthodox and Catholics), debated by the founding Churches of antiquity, and sealed by Athanasius of Alexandria, and accepted in faith, by all Christendom.<br />Even for the reformists, just around the turn of the nineteenth century, \\"When the British and Foreign Bible Society undertook to provide the copy of the bible for presentation to King Edward VII at his coronation in 1902, F. Temple, the Archbishop of Canterbury ruled that a 'mutilated bible'(lacking the Apocrypha) was unacceptable for the purpose, and as the Society was prevented by its constitution from providing an 'unmutilated' edition, a suitable copy has to be procured at short notice from another source.\\"  F.F.

Lawson, Folklore Bulletin<br /><br />Prologue, Assmann's Models:<br />In 1984 Jan Assmann undertook the ambitious task of investigating the nature of Ancient Egyptian theology that has so fundamentally influenced studies on Egyptian religion. His impact was so great that many of his models have since been adopted in recent scholarship. Building on M. Halbwach's concept of memory as a social phenomenon as well as an individual one, the Freudian psychodrama of repressing and ultimately resurrecting the past, he writes a unique study, Moses the Egyptian.<br /><br />Amarna Monotheism:<br />The 'Amarna heresy', or Atenism is thought to be the earliest monotheistic religious revelation ever, with a wealth of devotion and worship hymns of Aten. Atenism was associated mainly with the eighteenth dynasty Prophetic Pharaoh Amenhotep IV, better known as Akhenaten, the name he adopted. Recent Egyptologists indicate there are proofs that Aten was becoming more known during the eighteenth dynasty - notably Amenhotep III calling of his royal barge as the 'Spirit of the Aten.' Ultimately, it was Amenhotep IV who introduced Aten as the sole deity in his revolution, in a series of decreed steps culminating in the official endorsement of Aten as the sole universal god for the Egyptian Empire, and beyond. It was established as Egypt's state religion for around two decades, in the 14th century BC, before a violent return to the traditional Amen and Egyptian pantheon gods, while the name of the 'heretic Pharaoh' associated with Aten was completely erased from the Egyptian records.<br /><br />The Mind of Egypt:<br />Our western civilization is influenced in many ways by perspectives that originated in the Heliopolitan theology, such as the concept of monotheism. How and why monotheism became what it did has its source in Egypt as well. Without an understanding of how the Egyptians viewed the idea of the unity principle, 'one god, Lord of the Pantheon,' it will be difficult to see how this concept became corrupted through misapplication over time.<br />The enormous influence of the mind of Egypt on our continuing present is one of the stronger messages here, and this influence has made itself felt in a number of areas, not least the very modern study of religion itself. Assmann points out that even our concepts of monotheism and polytheism were hammered out in the burgeoning discourse of seventeenth century Egyptology. Todd Lawson, Toronto University.<br /><br />Heidelberg's Egyptologist in America:<br />Would you have visited Heidelberg, it's castle and university, you will have appreciated the rigor in color of German scholarship in a field that was a quasi monopoly for few European students of the great Civilization, formulated as the science of Egyptology. The idea of biblical revelation that stunned the young American Orientalist J. H. Breasted, when he studied ancient Egypt's moral codes, persuaded him to pursue his great adventure into the 'Dawn of Conscience', in ancient Egypt, a comparative study of Hebrew wisdom poetry with its analogous Egyptian parallels; impacted the twenty century religious imagination from Freud to Assmann. When Professor Assmann was invited by J. P.

He starts with a para-psychological definition of Egyptian thought construction as Mnemo-history, advancing into Suppressed history of Repressed memory of Akhenaten in Moses conscience, proceeding to Spencer's findings as 'before the Law.' The crux of his advancement to his ultimate thesis lies in a historical review of eighteenth century discourse on Moses. Freud shows up in a psychological spear head idea; 'the Return of the repressed,' the roots of Egyptian monotheistic theology of the elite was conceived in the 'One,' the master of Egyptian Pantheons, Aten, or Amon-Rae.

Schley<br /><br />Law & Wisdom:<br />Law is the core of Israel's culture that established the Judeo-Christian universal moral value behind it. Law in the Old Testament practically means 'the Law promulgated by Moses', with sundry later modifications or additions, rules as to which have been inserted in the record of the Mosaic law. As an example, some have suggested the prohibition on trimming your beard [Lev. 19:27] relates to pagan practices that cut facial hair for magical purposes. So the universal behind this cultural would be, don't do the occult.<br />Wisdom is really an approach to life, a way of looking at the world and, for Israelites, a way of living out in very deliberate, rational ways their commitment to God.<br />-The quality of being wise; knowledgeable, and having the capacity to make due use of it; discernment and judgment; \\" Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.\\" Job 28:28.<br />-Acquired knowledge; erudition. \\"Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.\\" Acts 7:22, and<br />-The results of wise judgments; scientific or practical truth.<br /><br />OT Wisdom Literature:<br />In the Hebrew Bible, 'wisdom literature' is generally understood to refer to Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes; among the Apocrypha, it includes Ecclesiasticus (The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach) and The Wisdom of Solomon. The extent to which other parts of the Bible can be described as `wisdom' is disputed, but certain Psalms seem to betray wisdom influence (e.g., Ps. 37). While Wisdom's roots go back to the early days of Israelite history, it began to flower in the latter part of the Old Testament period, and flourished in the Intertestamental period. The relationship between wisdom and apocalyptic and the extent to which the latter was influenced by the former also remains a debatable issue.<br /><br />Characteristic traits:<br />In dealing with the Hebrew Wisdom literature it is demanded that the whole body of it, so far as it has come down to us, should be taken into consideration, and not merely those books that have been admitted into the Canon, since the canonical standing of Wisdom books is quite arbitrary.<br />The objective of the Hebrew sage is to preserve and transmit the acquired lessons of experience, so that one may learn to cope with life. Proverbs upholds the optimistic view shared by such books as Deuteronomy but disputed by Job and Ecclesiastes. IT is characterized by an absence of reference to the typical salvation beliefs, such as the patriarchal promises, the Exodus, or the Sinaitic covenant. While certain literary forms are cultivated: the discrete, separate saying, which is usually an admonition, expressed in two parallel lines; whether positive or negative.<br /><br />Book Themes & Review:<br />This revised edition, considerably expanded to take in the legal and didactic material, gives additive attention to the different literary types used by Israel's sages and to the social settings in which the saying came into existence and circulated thereafter. The main purpose of Professor Blenkinsopp, however, remains the same from the first edition, to trace the course of two related key streams of tradition, law and wisdom, throughout the history of Israel in the biblical period, and to demonstrate their essential line of continuity with classical Jewish thought and early Christian theology.<br />The title specificity for the book as; 'The Ordering of Life in Israel and Early Judaism,' leads the reader to believe that the versatile, in depth, author is just going to deal with OT wisdom literature impact on shaping of life in Israel. Although his integrated approach was much more instructing than a mere reconstructive analysis of wisdom literature within the canon, or critical comparative evaluation with Egyptian and other wisdom literature but he could not have done better treating Law as wisdom in his flowing discussion that maintained the Life in Israel as an ultimate goal, as his title implies.<br /><br />Crenshaw Vs. Blenkinsopp:<br />As insightful Reviewer Lorna L. Wilson alleged for Crenshaw on the same subject, the same goes for Blenkinsopp. \\"The title of the book can be pleasantly deceiving. It goes well beyond the wisdom tradition found in the biblical books of Ecclesiates, Psalms, Proverbs, and Job. He takes a broader perspective and includes apocrypha writings as well as Egyptian and Mesopotamian literature.\\"<br />Overall, this book covers more than its declared purpose claims, which makes this concise book an in-depth visualization rather than a conventional text. Despite the variety and novelty of its treatment, the method pursued in this book, serves an excellent job of exposing the various component of form, content, and themes found within wisdom literature, as canonized by the Great Church of Alexandria, and other pseudo epigraphic writings.nd other wisdom literature but he could not have done better treating Law as wisdom in his flowing discussion that maintained the Life in Israel as an ultimate goal, as his title implies.

Unless evangelicals prod young people to disciplined thinking, they waste--even undermine one of Christianity's most precious resources. The mind that doesn't think God's thoughts after Him will be tempted to think the thoughts of others and leave God out of the process.\\" Carl Henry, a great Christian thinker<br />This became apparent in 'The Honest to God Debate,' which stood as a record of intense reactive thinking in response to his cry for honesty. The Bishop of Woolwich wrote later, \\"There has been ample evidence in my mail that the people are capable of being trusted and thinking for themselves far more than many of the clergy are prepared to allow.\\"<br />Hans Kung is a living example of thinking like Christ wanted us, and paid for it like his master.<br /><br />On Becoming a Christian Thinker:<br />Based on Gospel verses, Cobb asks Christians to reclaim their gift of thinking, and redeem thinking about God from theologians, confirming that all true disciples are theologians (religious thinkers). He elaborates on dual responses to tragedy in, prayer, and feminism.<br />\\"You examine the scriptures because you THINK that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that testify on my behalf.\\" John 5:39<br /><br />In 'Ethics and theology,' Cobb proposes a list of everyday Christian living problems, to tease your mind and engage your consciousness on: abortion, money, morality, homosexuality, in real and avowed beliefs. He then instructs the readers on how to reshape up their beliefs, through a process of evaluation, identification, and questioning tradition based on a central issue: Bible authority. He visualizes this central issue within a secular, historical, quadrilateral (Wesleyan) method endorsed and balanced with personal experience, reason and a living faith tradition. He then reverts to Scripture, as the core and basis of a Universal (Catholic) Christian tradition. He warns of the dangers of self deception in the post reformist experience, concluding that Only Christ is the everlasting center for genuine Christians.<br /><br />A Way of Thinking:<br />You can use science to expand your understanding of Jesus' hidden, inner message, by killing some of the mental holy cows, bred by ritual Christianity and scientific materialism. You can develop a deeper relationship with Jesus; moving from fear into love is the key to bringing Christian living into the new millennium reshaping a contemporary religion able to fulfill human spiritual needs in this age. If you feel that your faith in Jesus is being challenged by the times, this awakening book will help you overcome the reluctance to think, reclaim your spiritual life, and put on the Thinking Mind of Christ.<br /><br />Thinking in a Postmodern Era:<br />Cobb invites a group of theological thinkers; Mcnutt, Schmidt, Wilkins, Atwater, and Reynolds, in a virtual debate to promote thinking about: Christian Jewish issues, missions, ecumenism, utilizing historical analysis to reflect on the New testament in retrospect, concluding in a systematic theological synthesis.<br />Professionals and the academia are considered for help, with a cautionary word of advice. What about help to reengage the world in spite of counterattack? Within their retreat, theological students encounter world views; cosmology as well as historiology, and today politics and economics boldly outstay, while philosophy uses its tools of De- and Reconstruction of almost everything. In an anthropocentric culture, that produced Existentialism, and confronts faith with scientific discovery and challenges thinking by technology outbreaks prove rational Christian reasoning is crucial.<br /><br />Can a Christian Think independently?<br />Our teacher, Jesus Christ,kept asking his audience in repeated times to think, ask, and seek. Not only did he exhorted us to think, but also to examine (the scriptures), to find out and judge for ourselves!

History needs to be more than a dead archive. It needs the vivid enactment of a tradition which keeps it alive in the heart and mind of people.\\"<br /><br />Patristic in Modernity:<br /><br />The main challenge for such authentic effort to make original sources available is expressed by Fr. H. Alfeyev; \\"The distance-in time, culture, and spirituality- between the fathers and us is too great, it seems too difficult to surmount the obstacles that confound our attempts to penetrate the mind of the fathers. ... The works of the fathers are not a mere museum exhibit, just as the 'patristic faith' should not be understood as only a heritage of past centuries.\\"<br /><br />In Conclusion:<br /><br />Rowan Greer, of Yale divinity, and Patristic scholar & author would give you an expert view; \\"Much more, however, needs to be said. Dr. Vivian's introductions to the lives supply both scholars and general readers with an excellent account of the settings in which these saints lived and prayed.

Its parts, however, is not always arranged in the same way, but are separated and are again conjoined.\\" Stobaeus<br /><br />Nature of reality:<br />The nature of reality has been the subject for debate since Plato. The philosopher and scientist has been tantalized, while artists were mused.<br />Physics has pioneered alternate interpretations of the 'reality' of different experiential domains, but they cannot be applied to inner experiences or meaningful behavior. \\"Here, constructions of reality are needed that make the data from these realms lawful, not constructions borrowed from other realms,\\" state Margenau, a physicist and LeShan, a Psychologist, who together hold that one set of rules is insufficient as a reality measure, it is a must to have sufficient valid applicable data. A number of alternate realities must be allowed for, in order to make significant strides in science. They specify five principles: sensory realm; microcosm, too small to be sensed ; the macrocosm, too large to be even theoretically sensed ; human inner experience, and meaningful units of behavior of living things. Our organization of reality is what we observe of it and different organizations of it work best for different purposes. However, it must be organized lawfully, not whimsically; \\"reality is somehow there, but we alloy it into being with our consciousness\\".<br /><br />Einstein & Van Gogh:<br />Einstein and Van Gogh represent the western genius in science and arts' cultural and philosophical milieu, that developed into precise systems that explain reality in a literal sense. Those systems evolved to satisfy a human necessity to exert an ever increasing control of the environment. The metaphysical experience was not taken into consideration, and those explanation fell short of presenting a holistic reality.<br />In an often quoted passage, novelist and essayist Arthur Koestler wrote, \\"Einstein's space is no closer to reality than Van Gogh's sky. The glory of science is not a truth more absolute than the truth of Bach or Tolstoy... The scientist's discoveries impose his own order on chaos, as the composer or painter imposes his; an order that always refers to limited aspects of reality. Einstein's space is certainly closer to the world 'out there' than is Van Gogh's sky. But Van Gogh's sky is closer to our inner world. We must find ways to make these two worlds, these two visions of reality, mutually reinforcing.

The innovative authors of great books in their interfacing domains, brought together to create this study, boost your thought potentials and inspire a variety of human perception. The meaning of reality should first be addressed as structure and domains, before the search for 'scientific principles' starts. Re-etirating with reductionism, show how casualty, and epistemology are related, while delving into the worlds of Einstein and Heisenberg, before purpose could be achieved.<br />Part III discuses in a sublime articulation the reconstructed domains of social sciences, with a novel parallel between Newton and Goethe. The domain of Para psychology is very brisk and mind teasing on 'ostensibly paranormal phenomena'. The ethical domain which opens with a citation from the Lord's prayer, uses three figures to clarify authors reflection on physical realm. They utilize Eddington's two aspects of conciousness, and thermodynamics to reflect on Max Born's statement, \\"The physics of one period is the metaphysics of the next.\\"  They ultimately conclude with their thesis \\"that quantum mechanics leaves our body, our brain, at any moment in a state with numerous possible futures, each with a predetermined probability.

The ancient Hebrew ben (son of) was affixed to the father's given name to form a family name, although in some religious practices a child was referred to by a formula that substituted the mother's given name for the father's. Christians have traditionally baptized children with an appropriately Christian name, especially the name of a saint, henceforth the patron; an additional name is taken at confirmation. The Puritans discouraged the use of any but biblical first names.\\" (The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia)<br /><br />Uttering the Divine Name:<br />A waxing experience of the inwardness of the Divine Name was the proper counter-pole to [Hebraic] loss of participation. .  - By the time Jesus was born the Divine Name had ceased to be spoken by man in the Temple or elsewhere. The Pharisees had made it the name of a Being exclusively objective, remote, inaccessible, infinitely superior to, yet imagined as existentially parallel with man. Thus, the Jews had barely glimpsed, before they again lost sight of, that which is the opposite to man's otherness from the I AM, namely his supreme identity with it. Christianity has not entirely lost the meaning of the \\"teaching of the Creative Word.\\" Indeed, Barfield recognizes, \\"this last testimony to a creation which was not a mere creation of idols, and to an evolution which was not a mere evolution of idols, is one which Christian thought, thanks to the opening verses of St. John's Gospel, has never been able entirely to ignore, though it has now come near to doing so.

This volume attempts to clarify the progress of christological thought, in the East where theology was by far a monoply  between Alexandria and Antioch. Filling the needs of a wide readership, it describes the development of theological thought on the person of Christ, in the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries. It exposes the tensions which arose in inevitable post Chalcedon debates between the Diophysites and Miaphysites, reflecting on Pseudo-Dionysius, Maximus the Confessor, and John of Damascus, between many others. It discusses the theology beyond these debates on the identity of Christ, formally solved by the decrees of the council of Chalcedon, which left Christendom divided. It defines the theological problems raised by the arbitrariness of Eastern Roman emperors, in trying to solve the controversy.<br /><br />Methodology:<br />The late Fr. Meyendorff wrote this fine book, 35 years ago in French, his second and theological language, this SVP, 1975  second edition is an amended update, at the time.

Professor Richard Norris elaborated an informative introduction narrating the development of Christian thought about the person of Christ in the era of the church fathers. Starting with early christology, he explained its initial problems, and introduced the patristic authors, and their thought on Christology and the related subjects. He gave due attention, and space to the impact of Origen's view of the Logos and how his neo Platonic language was interpreted by his disciples, both orthodox and heterodox.<br /><br />The earliest text translated comes from Justin Martyr.  When the ideas and problems which were to dominate christological thought were first crystallized, Melito of Sardis, whose writing introduced here, were discovered lately. An excellent translation of the work of Irenaeus, the most important of the second century fathers, is an effective refutation of Gnosticism, whose sects and doctrines dominated the pagan intellect. The first confrontation between Athanasius and the Alexandrine Orthodoxy with Antiochene teaching in Lybian Presbyter Arius, who resided in Alexandria.<br /><br />The latest text is the known 'Definition of Faith' of the Schismatic Council of Chalcedon ( 451).

It is said that the questions that deserve be asked are those which could not be answered.<br />Those metaphysical inquiries were about theological/natural sciences, the cosmological question on origins of the universe, life, and Homo sapiens, and their approach to these quizzes, and thought on the concept of God.<br /><br />The Responses:<br />In his introduction which summarizes the spectrum of responses, Roy Varghese quotes Einstein, Plank, Heisenberg, and Hawking.<br />\\"Stranger than the strangest concepts and theories of science is the appearance of God on the intellectual horizon of twentieth century science,' deducts Varghese with reference to their statements. In 'A brief history of Time' Hawking declared, \\"We ought to know the mind of God', while Paul Davies is quoted to argue that, \\"the very fact that the universe is creative, and that the laws have permitted complex structures to emerge and develop to the point of consciousness- in other words, that the universe has organized its own self-awareness, is for me powerful evidence that there is 'something going on' behind it all.\\"<br /><br />Universe, Life and Deity:<br />In Paul Davis terminology, this is an inquiry in the mind of some very prominent scientists.

Some men have achieved greatness through one of these impulses alone, but the greatest men who have been philosophers have felt the need both of science and of mysticism.\\" B. Russell<br /><br />Knowledge through Mysticism:<br /><br />\\"Science needs no mysticism, neither does mysticism need science; but surely man needs both....Mystics explore our universe through meditation. Nuclear physicists explore it through experimentation and hypothesis. Their paths to the truth could not be more different-but the amazing thing is that in their own ways, the mystics and the scientists are discovering the same truths about our world.\\" (F. Capra)<br /><br />While knowledge is in the field of epistemology classified within two independent fields: intuitive/conceptual knowledge (a priori knowledge), and empirical knowledge (a posteriori knowledge). Mysticism is mainly concerned with knowledge a priori. Complete and valuable knowledge a posteriori cannot be made without the help of this first basic knowledge a priori, a knowledge revealed from a supernatural source.<br /><br />Logic of Mysticism!<br /><br />The celebrated author of 'Why I Am Not a Christian' proves again what J. Danielou stated in 'god and the ways of Knowing'; \\"Emmanuel Berl said recently that he had never met an atheist, only men who believe in God, without knowing exactly what they believe.\\" This applies perfectly to B. Russell, who boasted to being an atheist, a mystical one!<br /><br />In a poetical sonnet, Russell confesses the mysticism of Logic, \\"The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than a man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, it is to be found in mathematics as surely in poetry.\\" The meta physicist then compares 'Formal Logic' of pure mathematics, an edifying mysticism as; \\"the world of pure reason knows no compromise, no practical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity embodying in splendid edifices the passionate aspiration after the perfect from which all great work springs. Remote from human passions, remote even from the pitiful facts of nature, the generations have gradually created an ordered cosmos, where pure thought can dwell as in its natural home.\\" (pp. 63)<br /><br />A free man's worship:<br /><br />\\"The endless praises of the choirs of angels has begun to grow wearisome; for, after all, did He not deserve their praise?\\" (Dr. Faustus, Mephistopheles)<br /><br />The opening chapter of this gem, mocking liturgical 'Lex Orandi', is paradoxical, as much as 'Honest to God' came to be half a century later, a revolt against the follies committed in the expressions of nineteenth century Christianity. \\"Russell's razor-sharp mind has no difficulty in slicing through the old-fashioned arguments of natural theology,\\" declares Colin Brown. He uses sarcasm to make his point.<br /><br />Russell's Trinity college Milieu:<br /><br />\\"There are records of a Moral Sciences Club having been founded in 1874. Present at the meeting were Caldecott, seven other undergraduates of St John's and two of Trinity.

The first meeting of the Club at which a paper was given, took place in the rooms of T. E. Scrutton, Trinity, at PM on Saturday 26 October. The paper, by Caldecott, was \\"Development Theories of Conscience\\". About thirty students attended. The attendance is pretty much the same today as is the tone of the Club's minutes.\\" ([...])<br /><br />Earl Russell:<br /><br /> \\"...resolved to be hard-headed because he knows he cannot be.\\" ( Will Durant)<br /><br />\\"He was a mathematical genius, (a Nobel prize winner in literature) who wrote prose that could cut like a razor blade concerning the most abstruse subjects in a manner understandable to most laymen, and was a profound skeptic in re matters religious.

It is a communal way, in which the worship of churches is similar in core, even if varies with time, space, and culture.<br />Dr. Inge, the late Dean of St. Paul's, was asked by his neighbor, a distinguished liturgist, while dining at a high table in Oxford whether he was interested in liturgy; 'No,' replied the gloomy Dean, 'neither do I collect postage stamps'. It is, thus, a fairly rare occurrence for the theme of the rule of worship and faith to be treated by an eminent Protestant theologian, who sets in this work's scope; \\"One of my purposes in writing has been to rescue this interplay of worship and doctrine-with both its problems and its opportunities-as an area of interest for Protestant theology.\\"<br /><br />Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi:<br />An appropriate alternative title for 'organizing principle' in professor Wainwright's perception and elaboration of the vital relation between Christian theology and the praise of God.

These themes, most influential of Geoffrey Wainwright's contributions to systematic theology and ecumenism started to attract the attention of thoughtful Protestants, and many other Catholic and Orthodox believers, anew. The impressive author seeks to identify and describe the core of Christian life, to trace its modes and traditions, genuinely developing a systematic theology of worship.<br /><br />Fellowship of Praise:<br />It is amazing how he very well proves his point to my delight; \\"in collecting the texts of Eastern rites for publication in the Western world; the doctrinal question raised by the existence of these generally orthodox rites in the officially heterodox churches of the Monophysites and Nestorians did not escape the attention of the discerning.

Both theologians and philosophers had their respective doubts and frustrations. He pursues his goal by surveying the intellectual movements and their western thinkers during the second millennia.<br />He categorizes his work thus; \\"Histories of philosophy are not normally designed to be read through in bed, and the present one is not necessarily intended to be read through consecutively.\\"<br /><br />Views & Conclusions:<br />Colin Brown exposes an insightful brief survey of alternative philosophical bases of Christian doctrine, that influenced the faith of Christian Churches in the course of history. This is a systematic work of an uncommonly talented, and deeply commited theologian to present an analytical history of philosophy, with an emphasis on the different interpretations of the sustained encounters of the fads and fashions of philosophy with Christian faith. Colin Brown concludes in the postscript with lessons from the past criticizing the incompleteness of philosophical systems. Although he warns against dependence on a particular philosophy, he recognizes the necessity of the philosophy's invigorating inquiry that drives Christian theologians to reconsider their positions.<br /><br />Unique treatment:<br />In contrast to his intentional fast tour of medieval philosophy, he already started to interpret Anselm by Barth and Hartshorne. The author gave the Twentieth Century a relative elaborate and critical evaluation of new trends in logical positivism, and religious language before he reviews existentialism in the example of Bultmann and Tillich. He then introduces New Radicalism in Bonhoeffer, before his thorough exposition of J.A.T. Robinson's, Honest to God. He would not refrain from analyzing the 'Death of God' movement, but gives his debut on Cornilius Van Till and Francis Schaeffer.<br /><br />Biographical note:<br />Colin Brown (D.D., U. of Nottingham; Ph.D., Bristol University) is professor of systematic theology at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena.

Bokenkotter summarizes scholastic thought of Ansalm and Aquinas, inviting some of the most influential contemporary thinkers to debate them including; Kung, Rahner, and Schillebeeckx.

While this was exactly what 'Rabbi Jesus' rendered to his Jewish audience, a renewal of Mosaic law interpreted in Love, leaves one difference which is the person of the Messiah. Jews and Christians seeking Biblical authority and roots from the same OT books, but their perception of these books is significantly different.

Philokalia (Greek: 'Love of the Good, the Beautiful'), is an anthology of Christian monastic texts in Greek, that became part of a movement for spiritual renewal in mount Athos monastic life.  Compiled by the monk Nikodimos and bishop Makarios, of Corinth, the Philokalia was published in 1782.<br />b. Jesus prayer: in Eastern Orthodoxy, and recently readopted by Catholics, is a mental invocation of the name of Jesus Christ, alleged to be the most effective mystical method, when repeated continuously. The traditional form of the prayer is 'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner', reflects the biblical teaching by the Lord Himself in the Pharisee and the publican parable. The firm Judeo Christian belief that the name of God is so sacred, that its invocation implies a direct meeting with the divine, is at the core of this practice.<br />c. The Hesychast movement, which has the Prayer of the Heart as its basic 'technique,' was started there by St. Gregory Palamas in the 14th century. The Jesus Prayer (of the Heart) was considered 'unorthodox' when it first showed up on Mt. Athos, but later the Greek Curia were to adopt this Hesycast practice.<br /><br />PhiloKalia on Prayer:<br />The Byzantine Canon of spirituality, according to Fr. A. Schmemann, integrated into one vision the writings of the fathers, with the monastic experience of prayer, that sprung from an ascetic way of life, whose summa is the Philokalia.<br />The selection of texts in the philokalia, in bishop K. Ware's words, 'was no doubt made in part for programmatic reasons. Nevertheless the book as a whole, without being systematic, presents a specific and coherent view of the Christian life.'  Relying on both 'Abbas', it is evident that the following issues started in spirit but yielded eventually to blessed rituals;<br />a. Although the sayings of the desert fathers, following Macarius the great on the arrow prayer in thrice invocations of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Byzantine disciples changed it to the mechanical repetition of Jesus name, based on a dyophysite dogma, for use in defense against the Miaphysite Trisagion.<br />b. Accordingly, it became more effective to edit the writings of the philokalia, whose text was no doubt, adapted from the sayings of the desert fathers initially intended for their monastic disciples, to a book for all Eastern Orthodox, laity and monks alike, although the necessity of a spiritual counselor is repeatedly emphasized.<br />c. The evident drawback which became characteristic of Byzantine liturgy in general, was the intentional inclusion of dogma and closely linking it to spirituality. Setting the life of prayer firmly in context of Trinitarian theology and Christology, misperceived the intentions of its great defender, Cyril of Alexandria,from doctrine into daily practice.<br />d. The philokalia, for obvious dogmatic reasons, shied from the Macarian writings by paraphrasing them, but directly quoting two of his disciples on prayer; Evagrius Ponticus, and St. Basil, and some later students in the desert fathers' school of prayer, Denis Areopagite, G.Palamas, Symeon the New theologian, and Maximus the Confessor.<br />e. Now, ascetic rules were imposed, as an outward observation, contradicting a main central theme of inner spiritual way. The key concepts became attentiveness, vigilance, to stillness if it ever matures this way, but the continuos remembrance of the Lord stayed there.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />In spite of any drawbacks, due to dogmatic intrusions, the Philokalia stays a collection of beautiful sayings, apart from if its overall theme is clear, and how can you apply them.<br />To achieve its goal, you need to have the guidance of an experienced elder, from the Macrian tradition of the unceasing prayer.

Since Vatican II, where Kung was appointed 'Peritus' by Pope John, the Vatican's 'Sacred' Congregation for Doctrine & Faith activated an inquiry into his dossier and forbade his book, 'the Church' to be translated or even discussed. Meanwhile his: 'Infallible? An inquiry' generated a worldwide acclaim, that caused his censure. On December 18, 1979, the Vatican curia issued a declaration against Kung's doctrinal views, and withdrew his canonical mission to teach Catholic theology!<br /><br /> Why Kung stayed faithful?<br /><br /> This concise essay, crystal clear, and prophetically insightful is no doubt Kung's most fundamental statement on the essentials of Christian faith. Simply, a personal testimony by a great Christian, written with the layperson in mind, yet would oblige all serious theologians. Kung presents his basic theological conviction, which is the core of his thought, as represented in his basic works; 'Christianity, Essence, History, and Future,' and 'On Being a Christian,' etc. It iterates great works by other reformers like John Robinson's; &quot;The difference in being a Christian&quot;, and Paul Tillich's 'The courage to be.'<br /><br /> Even for those who disagree with Kung's theological positions as stated in his numerous books: 'My struggle for freedom', 'Reforming the Church Today', 'Infallible?: An inquiry', etc., Hans Kung, remains faithful, like all earnest apostolates who called for the renewal of the Church, through the Holy spirit, the source of its life and power, according to the promise of her Victor Christ.<br /><br /> The Courage to be &quot;Christian&quot;<br /><br /> I was deeply moved by Kung's Christian faith and commitment, as it was pleasantly presented in this compact book. All authentic Christians, should read this faithful testament, to realize how we all share the true foundations of our common faith, with our Catholic, Protestant and Eastern brothers. This &quot;personal testimony&quot; reveals his tender heart and passionate devotion, not merely his theological erudition and scholarly achievements. Reading this book is an excellent attempt to meet with Kung, with the faithful who abides with the teaching authority of only the Christ. Accordingly, Kung asserts his conviction that real Christianity, against nominal institutional, and petrified traditional Christianity, has the core values, and essence of an abundant and meaningful life, ever renewed by love that upgrade us to sonship in viewpoints, actions, motives, and attitudes.<br /><br /> &quot;How Do We Persevere?&quot;<br /><br /> Only one who has had the courage to try, even oppressed by the Curia but never defeated, could have shared his experience with the Church of Karl Barth, St. John of San Francisco, Karl Rahner, Abba Kyrillos, and all the people of God. He stated that with clarity on the reason and means to persevere. In conclusion Kung challenges us all -- divided Christians-- to hear the Spirit's calling to unity in the mystical body of Christ.e the true foundations of our common faith, with our Catholic, Protestant and Eastern brothers.

Zwingli,'the peoples preacher,' controversially walked around in Zurich eating wurst, during the Catholic fasts.<br /><br />American theologues' Humor:<br />The adjective 'American' is added, since the humorous attitude of the European faithful was, at least, occasionaly felt. But for the most part, theologues today, whether in church, seminary, or divinity school don't make humor like they used to. In Great Britain, even at the time of the 'Gloomy Dean,' the verses on the graduate student at Trinity who abandoned Math and took divinity was very popular. British theologians, and preacher habitually included brisk humor in their discussions, essays, and sermons. F. F.

The author, John Currid got his Ph.D. degree from the Oriental Institute, at the University of Chicago, one of the finest, a Pioneer to the Past, established by the eminent Egyptologist James H. Breasted. Prof. Edwin Yamauchi, a towering expert, and author of 'Persia and the Bible', described the book as; &quot;An excellent study of the Egyptian background of certain parts of the Old Testament. The author has read widely and commented judiciously on a number of very interesting topics.&quot; While K.

In five parts, Currid writes a plan, elaborates on his defense of the Old debated case for the Egyptian Origins of OT, as follows<br />1. Egypt and the Bible / ancient Near east Cosmologies.<br />2. Pentateuch Egyptian Element.<br />3. Egypt / Israel in the Historical Books<br />4. Parallels of Egyptian Wisdom<br />5. Prophecy in Egypt and Israel.<br />This book represents the depth of American scholarship in comparison to the broad and versatile style treatment of such subjects as represented by: Moses, The Egyptian, which Jan Assmann, of Heidelberg University wrote in California, same year. Assmann puts it forward; &quot;The aim of a mnemohistorical study is not to ascertain the possible truth of traditions such as the traditions about Moses but to study these traditions as phenomena of collective memory. Memories may be false, distorted, invented, or implanted.&quot; Moses the Egyptian, Jan Assmann<br />Conscience and Revelation:<br />Currid does not intend to support the historicity of the Hebrew Bible but just to explain why it is logical. The most important issue here is what shocked his own pioneer James Breasted; &quot;When that experience began, it was a dark day for my inherited respect for the theological dogma of 'revelation.' I had more disquieting experience before me, when as a young Orientalist I found that the Egyptians had possessed a standard of morals far superior to that of the Decalogue over a thousand years before the Decalogue was written.&quot; Revelation should be directly proportional to the tuned perception of the receiving side to interpret the All Knowing Lord's thought line.<br />Egyptian Wisdom Parallels:<br />Job, written some fifteen hundred years before a similar book among the Hebrew wisdom, reminds OT scholars of the Hieratic papyrus in the Berlin Museum: 'A dispute over Suicide', that dates from the middle kingdom (Ca 1900 BC).<br />The use of dialogue to treat a philosophical and religious problem is followed by the author of the book of Job in his presentation of the problem of suffering more than fifteen hundred years later.&quot; (Documents from Old Testament Times, W. Thomas, Editor)<br />Here I find Currid's treatment of the Egyptian parallels in Psalms and Proverbs is much short of Breasted's original and thorough treatment, apart from 'Proverbs 22 and Amenemope.' My NRSV Harper Collins study Bible, W. Meeks Editor, indicate in the foot comments: &quot;Proverbs 22.17-24.22 this section departs from the proverb collections of 10.1-22.16, as it makes a free adaptation from the popular Egyptian wisdom text; The instruction of Amenemope.&quot;<br />Interrelation Reconstructed:<br />The greatest early Bible commentators and exegesis were from the two great Churches in the East, Alexandria and Antioch, both of Jewish ancestry, who did not find anything illogical in the Biblical derivations.

Fifteen lectures just delivered before the break of W.W.II at Salzburg, Austria, made the chapters of this book.<br /><br />In Conclusion:<br />\\"From the start we have seen that theology in the catholic sense of the word, as a listening to the personal revelation of the supremely free and transcendent God to humanity, cannot be set up in function of humanity, that it always rests on the fact of such a Logos of God. all sciences, are in a true sense, anthropology, except for theo-logy. all of them, irrespective of their reference to things, are based in their reality and procedure upon the logos of humanity; they are the 'things in the spirit of humankind.\\" K.R.<br /><br />A Posteriori:<br />\\"However, those who do not share this a posteriori prejudice and who have not, from the start, given up the courage of the absolute within the finite, cannot find it difficult to establish the essentially qualitative difference of Christianity from all other religions, to recognize the Church as the sign raised among the nations.\\"<br />\\"When this courage is lacking, when one claims at the most only a certain preference above other forms of Christian religion, one gives up the historical uniqueness of God's word and together with the courage of believing in a real revelation of God.\\" Karl Rahner<br /><br />Publisher, Translator & Editor:<br />The prestigious Continuum should be commented for taking this task of rendering the translation of this First Edition by Fr. Donceel, of Fordham, who gave an informing preface, while Prof. Tallon of Marquette University edited the lectures into chapters as such, with a good introduction and Notes.

It was these that produced the Scriptures, the formulations of the Councils,...\\" An Introduction to Patristics, Monachos.Net<br /><br />Ancient study of scripture:<br /><br />The study of the scripture with the company of early church fathers, is a great project, invigorating patristic hopes, that Nottingham's patrologist Dr. George Bebawi has proposed to translate the series into Arabic for the benefit of Christian readers in the Middle East. Chris. Hall, the coeditor of \\"Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture\\" has written a pleasant and useful introduction to the Commentary series and to patristic studies of scripture, in general, targeted for the curious American reader. He discusses in a logical sequence expected queries of the postmodern western mind, \\"why pursue an abandoned Eastern Church tradition, when they no more read the scripture, let alone studying it?\\" Hall uses here the authority of Robert Wilken and Thomas Oden's own journey home to the Fathers through PaleoOrthodoxy, to prove his case to patrology seekers. The desert fathers, says Burton-Christie, needed only scripture to sustain their spiritual life.<br /><br />Fathers of the Church:<br /><br />The Church Fathers are; \\"Ecclesiastical leaders and teachers who are accepted as authorities in matters of doctrine. In the early Church, Orthodoxy was determined by the so-called consensus patrum that showed general agreement among a set of Christian leaders distinguished by purity of faith, holiness of life, approval of the church, and antiquity.\\"  Nelson's New Christian Dictionary<br /><br />None of first and second century fathers could make it to Hall's list of Church Fathers, neither Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, Clement of Alexandria, Justin, Irenaeus, nor Polycarp. The master of all exegetes, Origen (6000 works) was covered only as representative of the Alexandrine school, and Dionysius the Great, pioneer of textual & redaction criticism was totally ignored.<br /><br />Reading with the 'Doctors':<br /><br />When evangelical biblical scholars discovered that their exegetical memory was far from adequate, they searched to confirm what the experts of Vatican II have learned about ancient Church leading figures; and their masterful command of Scriptural sense. In his 'Theology Reader,' Alister McGrath edited writings within a proposed study panel on interpretation of scripture (panel 5) that included: Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, Origen, Augustine, and Bernard of Clairvaux, latest of the Fathers. Hall is also reading the scripture with the eight church teachers, including a sampler of their contributions to the early Church biblical thought, and Hermeneutical views. He also presents a birds eye view of the patristic thought on: allegory in the scripture, Christology, development of scripture, prayer, etc. He treated fairly well the basic church exegetical traditions in Alexandrian allegory and the Antiochene sticking to historical facts and moral interpreting methodology.<br /><br />Father's Comparative deductions:<br /><br />\\"When we trace the development of patristic literature we discover something of how the intellectuals thought,\\" says RPC Hanson, who in his 'Introduction: Historical Theology,' reminded us of the fact that, \\"The Fathers placed the Bible in the context of the Christian life\\"<br /><br />Dr. Hall seems to have intentionally avoided a systematic and extensive discussion of biblical exegesis, in favor of introducing the novice reader to a group of patristic figures defined by the Roman Church canons, as Doctors of the Church.<br /><br />Even if recognized as exemplary in their approach to interpret the Bible devotionally, ecclesiastically, and morally (Chrysostom), works of great Biblical interpreters, including Cyril of Alexandria, who wrote the best on the Gospel of Luke, and Doctor of theCatholic Church, and Cyril of Jerusalem was left out.<br /><br />While Dr. C. Hall gave enhancing applications, he could have elaborated on comparing Golden mouth with the brilliant reading of Gregory on priesthood, as masterfully exposed by Dr. Yanney, the founder of the first patristic review in North America; \\"Priesthood between St. Gregory and St. Chrysostom, Coptic Church Review, vol. 20, No. 4.<br /><br />Dr. Chris Hall decided honestly that the meager exegetical crop of early Christian 'mothers' does not sustain the anti chauvinist title of \\"church mothers\\"<br /><br />What do Patrologists say?<br /><br />Dr. Chris Hall was reluctant to mention any of the contemporary masters of patristic studies: Bettenson, Sebastian Brock, H. Chadwick, Crouzel, Daniellou, De Lubac, or Hanson, let alone Sidney Griffith. Borrowing Fr. Griffith words, \\"One does not mean to complain immoderately, nor to appear ungrateful for what is on its own term a good study of a timely and an important topic; nor does one want to review a book the author never intended to write,\\" adding there is room to expand this good introductory study. The best defense in favor for patristic studies is its overwhelming influence in restoring the Roman Church to Catholic originals by the above 'Nouvelle theologie' through the writings of the Church Fathers. I hope when he edits his reader friendly essay, that he may not overlook the recent monumental work by Charles Kannengiesser; \\"Handbook of Patristic Exegesis: The Bible in Ancient Christianity\\", April 2004<br /><br />A Qualified Book Review:<br /><br />\\"Few observers would contest that the exegesis of the Bible has now fully entered a postcritical moment.

Sir James Jeans argued that, \\"If the universe is a universe of thought, then its creation must be an act of thought.\\" Dr. Forster suggests that the void is God's 'mental space,' supported by Einstein's matter-tensor, giving mathematics a mass-energy substance of 'shaping of the void.'<br /><br />Torrance Theological Science:<br />In nine lucent addresses on the interrelation between Christian theology and natural science, that linked the genius thought of J.

This book is, no doubt, one of the best concise Mathematics friendly essays a smart but busy reader could be advised to examine. Dr. Foster is here presenting the &quot;Cambridge Scientists view,&quot; stating that 'the stuff of the world is a mind-stuff,' with up to date statistical proofs of every day encounters. Foster ably addresses and reconciles twentieth century science with theistic mathematical certitude, linking and taking as a new base of statistical thermodynamics and quantum physics of Max Plank, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg and Pauli,  utilizing common scientific thesis that a non specialist can comfortably conceive.

This is, no doubt, the best book on rediscovering the roots of Gnosticism in Chenoboskion. Doresse's enthusiasm makes this book an enjoyable reading, even with all the complicated Gnostic thought and philosophical terms. He studied with Togo Mina, a Coptic scholar, then director of the Coptic Museum, under Prof. Pueuch, and was one of the first few with whom Mina consulted. Doresse got the finesse to lead the reader to appreciate the beauty of these writings, explaining their underlying thought clearly, and without bias.<br />Despite the forty five years since its publication, its masterful introduction to Gnosticism and elaborate account of the discovery, and re-acquiring of the smuggled codices keeps it still very vivid. A detailed description of the codices is given, before he starts a discussion of the texts themselves, and what they reveal to him of Gnostic belief and practice, with a special emphasis on the Gospel of Thomas.<br />Previously known to scholars?<br />Before unearthing Chenoboskion library, almost all existing original references on Gnosticism were written in Coptic; including the Askew codex, the Bruce fragments, codex Berolensis that no one knows where did it disappear after the fall of Berlin. These gnostic writings were previously known to scholars, but no one would have expected that such a Gnostic collection, could show up in this great variety. Doresse's personal experience, and excitement over his early participation in these discoveries renders the book brisk and engaging, even if the subject could have been academic and monotonous. Given that most of what we knew about the various sects of Gnostics came from the surviving writings by early Christians Church fathers like Iraeneus, Tertulian, Clement and Origen, the core reality of gnosticism was not distorted but only partly understood, in the light of these apologies. Doresse thoroughly reviews what was known of Gnosticism before these writings were recently unearthed.<br />Doresse analysis of Chenoboskion Marvels:<br />Outlining and discussing those texts previously known in ancient writings, only by title or through brief quotations from writings that has been long thought to be lost, is part of his amazement. He is overwelmed due to the broad spectrum of sources the Gnostics relied on. The library includes, Hermetic Egyptian and Persian manuals as well as a great part of vaguely known but long time lost apocryphal Christian writings and Apocalyptic books. This leads Doresse to confirm his mentor Professor Pueuch theory of Judaic roots of Gnosticism, and would also explain how some scholars comment on the 'more Gnostic sounding passages' of the New Testament.<br />It was also an amusing surprise to find adaptations of earlier known works selectively edited for Gnostic use, renamed, and ascribed to more authorititive writers. This practice does make it difficult to take at face value the Library's outstanding pseudo-Christian works attributed to the Evangelists, Apostles, and even Jesus Christ Himself. At the same time, it also makes some scholars wonder if any of the same sayings infelterated into Christian doctrines or even included within the canonical books of the New Testament in its final form. (authorized by St Athanasius in his paschal letter of 367).<br />Secret Words of Jesus:<br />The words of Jesus, secretly revealed to his disciples, his teachings given an enhanced meaning are fascinating in that these ideals are so poetic. No doubt, that the Gnostics adapted some Eastern Church teachings, including descent into Hades, Christ teaches that spiritual knowledge is gained speculatively through meditation on Gnostic scripture, a merit of the few, through a knowing faith, and contemplative prayer. For Gnostics, faith is just the beginning, following the lead of Easterners, whereas for some western Christians, faith in Jesus is their only forensic justification goal.<br />Epilogue: Savior Descent into Hades:<br />'Here, the Chenoboskion manuscript presents a lacuna which the Berlin Codex enables us to fill: the Savior recalls the descent into the lower world by which he is coming to deliver the human creature enslaved to the Archons. \\"I have struck off the chains...I have broken down the doors of the pitiless and humiliated them...I have revealed to you the name of the Perfect and the whole desire of the mother of the angels. I came to reveal to you that which exists since the beginning. I came because of the pride of the archigenitor and his angels, who say, ' We are gods!' to condemn them by revealing to everyone the God who is above the universe. Trample under foot their sepulchers! let their yoke be broken, that mine may be exalted?\\" (page 200)tive prayer.

Rahner and von Balthasar.<br />It is true that the renovation of the Church came through the rediscovery of the Holy Scripture as the living source of a true redemptive theology. It was the 'Nouvelle Theologie' move that rediscovered the riches of the early Church fathers especially Origen and the Alexandrine interpretation and liturgical tradition, that motivated the peritos of Vatican II.<br />Theology and Anthropology:<br />The first part of this fresh systematic approach to theology starts the logical way in 'Revelation and Mystery,' exposing the mystery of God and personal character in salvation history. Followed by the place of Christianity in the modern world, and the sense of freedom and human rights.<br />Christology and Anthropology:<br />The Alexandrine Christology reserved for Christ a soteriological title: the Philanthrope which Cardinal Kasper summarizes in a Vatican II statement, &quot;in Jesus Christ God 'revealed man to himself,' a modern restatement of Athanasius theosis slogan, &quot;God became man, that man can become god.&quot; I would have this book just for chapters IV &amp; V, where doctor Kasper wrote the best concise defense of true Christology, just in 36 pages. He traces the controversy of Christ's person in his compelling treatment of Chaledonian aftermath of the miaphysite out cry, 'One of the Trinity died in the flesh.' He candidly quotes few of the outstanding theological observations (Luther, Ebeling, Stockmeier)<br />A Sacrament of Salvation:<br />Part two of this study is concerned with the role of the Church in and as a universal sacrament of salvation. He declares, &quot; So if the sacraments are embodied Word, and signs of faith, this provides the justification for seeing sacramental acts as an integral part of the actualization of God's saving mystery in Jesus Christ. This holistic viewpoint has been more or less maintained in the orthodox Church down to the present day,&quot;<br />Aspects of the Eucharist:<br />The unity and variety of the Eucharistic expression is a basic reassessment of the Eucharist as Christ with us in the summing up of Christian mystery of salvation, quoting cardinal Kasper; &quot;We cannot therefore understand the Eucharist if we start from only one of its manifold aspects. It is not solely, or primarily, a meal; nopr is it thanksgiving and sacrifice. It is at once God's gift and grateful, sacrificial self-giving, because it makes Jesus Christ present in his person and his work. But we cannot stop short even at this glorious all-embracing vision, inspired by Origen.&quot;s Christ.

Developing the New Testament implication of the image of God in Christ, Leonid Ouspensky, Orthodox theologian and icon expert wrote, \\"Christianity raises the image of Christ before the world. Christianity shows the prototype according to which man was created, now hidden because of his sin. This image lives in Tradition, the mystical memory of the Church, its inner life.\\"<br /><br />Christ, true image of God:<br />Eastern Orthodox and Greek Byzantines refer to icons as being 'written' rather than painted, since icons are treated as theological texts, a graphical depiction of scripture. Only Christ is the true image of God. Christ is the prototypical icon: Whoever experience Christ does enter mystically into the Father's presence, in fullness. The icon's place in the church liturgical life is derived from the living personal existence, in whom the unity of the nature of God with sanctified human beings is vividly clear. Through Christ and in Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit, human beings are called to something more. Humans are called and allowed to be images of Christ.<br /><br />Creative Iconographic theology:<br />Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn discerns the depth of the truth of Cyril's teaching on the unity of Christ, masterfully exposing Origen's Iconclastic Christology, and compares two of his students St. Athanasius and Arius place of image in their systematic theology of the Person of the Word. Eusebius' view, midway between the Orthodox and neoplatonist, expressed a third way of interpreting their common master Origen. The enlightened Cardinal presents the most fascinating expression in the real great Eastern Orthodox, Maximus the confessor, Love as the Icon of God.

(Karl Rahner)<br />The author &amp; the Book:<br />J. Patout Burns, is a fine patrologist, a founder and past president of the American Patristic Society, 92/93. He authored many articles and books, on the message of the Fathers of the Church, the Economy of Salvation, and the Pelagian Controversy. Theological Anthropology is the third in the: sources of Early Christian Thought, a series of English translations and studies to render the fathers understanding better.<br />The theme of the book is to examine the human person, presenting an overview of coherent patristic thought in Irenaeus of Lyon, Gregory of Nyssa, Pelagius, an Augustine. He offers a selected appetizer from the Holy Fathers on faith issues.<br />Patristic Anthropology:<br />In a concise review, JP Burns explains in plain English early Christian thought and its encounter with Gnostic ideas, and the ascetic movements. He shows how neoplatonism became the carrier of Alexandrine theology, and calls it Christian Platonism.<br />The Apostolic Fathers of the Church developed many interesting apologetic insights into the study of man, an anthropology deeply embedded in scriptures. Based on Genesis, it was developed in a continuity and contrast with Jewish thought.  Other aspect which considers man as conceived within the context of early mystery religions, and Alexandrine Neo-Platonism enabled the Fathers to develop their ideas, thus helping them to present a far elaborate biblical and philosophical anthropology. They remained faithful to the revelation on man as given by the OT and Paul's Epistles. Alexandrine anthropology, has already taken far strides of a wider scope based mainly on the fundamental Pauline text (Acts 17:22-31).<br />St. Augustine of Hippo , theory of man, and free will debate with Pelagius, opened up the study of man towards a deeper understanding of man's relationship to God, in the Synergy of salvation. Patristic Anthropology accordingly got tightly linked to patristic soteriology, as best illustrated in Cyril of Alexandria.<br />Irenaeus &amp; man's evolution:<br />The theological anthropology of  St. Irenaeus of Lyons (2nd century) however, is not speculative, but got some very original ideas of mans conscious development to meet gods plan for his salvation (through spiritual evolution). It actually reduces itself to a practical explanation of traditional theology, yet, the majority of third century Fathers and Christian writers follow his work Against Heresies, where he writes:<br />&quot;Humanity slowly progresses, approaches perfection, and draws near to the uncreated God. The perfect is the uncreated, God. It was therefore appropriate for humanity first to be made, being made to grow, having grown to be strengthened, being stronger to multiply, having multiplied to recover from illness, having recovered to be glorified, and once glorified to see its Lord. God is the one who is going to be seen; the vision of God produces incorruptibility; incorruptibility makes a person approach God.&quot;Synergy of salvation.

He is compared only to Einstein and Maxwell by many scientists of renown. John the Grammarian was appreciated by the great physicist Huygens, father of modern light theories.  Masters of Elm Alkalam, Islamic dialectic medieval philosophy has known him 'Yahya AlNahawi, utilizing his authority in their debates. No serious book on the history of Eastern Christianity or account of doctrinal theology, dare neglect him.  He became recently a focal point in the interface of science with theology. In 1990, after 13 centuries, the Greek Orthodox Church lifted the unjust anathema of the sixth council in 681, on initiative of the outstanding theologian professor T. Torrance of Edinburgh.<br />The arbiters' Setting in life:<br />Many books were written about John's outstanding and original achievements in philosophy of natural science and cosmology. He was called 'the most learned man of his time.' Mckenna's thesis is unique because in spite of many particular details, and many quotations in Greek, German, and French is a condensed though thorough study, self booting, inspiring treatment of the sixth century Alexandrian scientist, exposing his Christology. (an alternative is to read the books listed at this review's end)<br />How to read the Book:<br />For a first timer encountering our marvelous Archdidaskalos, a great defender of Alexandrine Orthodox Miaphysite (united nature) and his philosophical defense of its Christology, I would follow this sequence:<br />a. Ch. 3, The Scientific Culture of Alexandria:<br />Dr. McKenna takes you in a speedy refresher of john's place of life and work, its history, civilization and wonders. How in 220 BC Alexandria replaced Athens as the center of development of civilized culture. He traces its scientific institutes, and the creation of its great school of theology. He explains how the tradition in the megalopolis formed many Church fathers from Athanasius to Severus of Antioch, John's senior confraterner and theological mentor. He touches on John's Creation ex Nihilo first proposed by his grand teacher Origen.<br />b. Ch. 2, The empire of Justinian:<br />The skillful author zooms the scene to the wider imperial theological environment that started in &quot;the age of Theodosius,&quot; extending into Justinian's (527-65). He tactfully wraps up the social, and theopolitical currents of post Caledonian Constantinopole, linking it with the Arbiter call to end or establish a common ground between the two schismatic factions. The elaboration on the roots of the diophysite problem since Nestorius does not hinder you to see his target in the seventh chapter of &quot;The Arbiter' by our prominent Alexandrian.<br />this chapter not only exposes the historical, but compares the ultimate evaluation of Severus christology by Lebon, von Harnack and Grillmeier.<br />c. Ch. 4, The life setting of the Arbiter:<br />In a dramatic closure in a letter to Justinian, the peak of the dilemma is clear, Cyril-Severus christological language expressed in the unparalleled logic of a genius, that capture your mind and emotion had to wait for thirteen centuries to be deciphered and appreciated. The schismatic Council of chalcedon representing Pulcheria's hate, Leo's egomania, a shameful yield of the gathered bishops, and the political inflexibility of Dioscorus came to an end in 1990.<br />d. Ch. 1, The anathema:<br />The scandal of using a dictated theology to achieve Imperial unity (as described by John Meyendorff) is summarized and concluded in Mckenna's words; &quot;there never was a time when the human nature of Christ existed independently of the divine nature of Christ, the word of God. Philoponus believes his explanation is not only in line with Cyril and Severus, but is also rightly informed by the science that prevails in the Academy at Alexandria.&quot;;	2004-01-09

The New Man shows Thomas Merton at the ripe of his spiritual powers and has as its theme the question of spiritual identity. Merton's meditative interpretation of the Bible can be met throughout his essay on the history of fall and theology of redemption. Reading such experience of the mystical transformation in which we will be perfectly conformed to the likeness of Christ, involves the kenosis / theosis way of the desert fathers.  We will become 'the New Man' who is the Christ, the new Adam. Salvation, rightly understood and genuinely experienced, is to realize that we are shaped in God's image and created for fellowship with the Living and Loving Creator.  This process promises not only self-discovery but also self-realization. To reach one's 'real self' one must, in fact, be delivered by grace from the illusionary and falsely created self, corrupted by our selfish habits and self deceit.<br /><br />Life, death, and identity:<br />What must we do to recover possession of our true selves?<br />Merton discusses how we became strangers to our inner selves by our dependence on outward recognition and material success. Life and death are at war within us. As soon as we are born, we begin at the same time to live and die. Even though we may not be even slightly aware of it, this battle of life and death goes on in us inexorably and without mercy......, instructed by the Spirit Who alone can tell us the secret of our individual destiny, man begins to know God as he knows his own self. The night of faith has brought us into contact with the Object of all faith, not as an object but as a person Who is the center and life of our own being, at once. His own transcendent Self and the immanent source of our own identity and life. ( Opening and closing paragraphs)<br /><br />New Man's Theosis:<br />\\"Is it the promise of the serpent, that we can \\"become like God, knowing good and evil?\\" Theft of Promethean fire is an endemic human inclination, the expression of a Gnostic theosis. Thomas Merton, the genuine Catholic Patristic student, in 'The New Man', takes the reader back to Origen who laid the foundations of the theology of redemption, which has been developed into the history of salvation. Origen initiated the concepts, interpreting the kingdom of God either as the apprehension of divine truth and spiritual reality, and in his explanation of Luke 17:21, the ultimate indwelling of the Logos (or the seeds of truth implanted in our souls) through the grace of Jesus Christ. \\"Origen conceives of Jesus' human nature as having been progressively deified through its union with the Logos; after the resurrection materiality disappears and His human soul becomes fused ineffably with the Logos.\\" Quoted from Early Christian Doctrine, JND Kelley<br /><br />Christ, the New Man:<br />The New Man's theme is the question of spiritual identity (theosis). Merton's interpretation of Genesis can be met throughout his essay on the history of fall and theology of redemption, such experience is the mystical transformation in which we will be perfectly conformed to the likeness of Christ. Salvation, rightly understood and genuinely experienced, is to realize that we are shaped in God's image and created for fellowship with the Living and Loving Creator. This process promises not only self-discovery but also self-realization. It involves a kenotic way, of the desert fathers, into union with God, theosis. We will become like 'the New Man' who is the Christ, the new Adam.<br /><br />Promethean Theology:<br />The longing of the restless spirit of man, seeking to transcend itself by its own powers, is symbolized by the need to scale the impossible mountain and find there what is after all our own. The great error of Promethean salvation is that it takesno account of anyone but self.<br />The image of God is brought to life in us when it brakes free from the shroud and the tomb in which our self consciousness had kept it prisoner, and loses itself in total consciousness of Him Who is holy. This is one of the main ways in which \\"he that would save his life will loose it.\\" (Luke 9:24)<br /><br />Thomas Merton Writings:<br />Merton, who had a unique gift of a probing intellect, absorbed various human cultures since his early childhood in Prades. He digested a wide spectrum of knowledge during his study in Cambridge and Columbia and later when he adopted Trappist monastic vocation, delved into a very different environment.

Brueggemann. Many suggestions and insinuations were given to his original identity or its literary form; a Greek mythology, an Egyptian wisdom, or a Jewish poetry. Its reputation, perhaps earned because of its obscure Hebrew, or its poetic rendering, making its translations harder to understand, perhaps because it's topic is too painful and the answers 'Theodicy oriented'. When feeling persecuted by men, or abandoned by God, many think, \\"It has been rightly said that behind the treatment of Job's fate in this discussion lie \\"very bitter experience of a supra individual kind.\\" When the sufferer complains, \\"He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone\\" (Job 19:10), this seems no more a complaint of a single person.\\" Martin Buber<br /><br />Main issues in Job:<br />Most scholars argue that Job is a poetic apology in vindication of the justice and goodness of Adonai, Lord of Hosts. Although these divine features are evident in the narrative, its main purpose may stay obscure. Job is blameless and upright from the beginning and, although embittered, nothing is able to move his faith. He declared, \\"If He would slay me, I should argue my cause to His face.\\" Job 13:15, NEB. Satan was allowed to test Job and was unsuccessful. Job didn't he was proving God's confidence in him. The integrity of Job is thus an indicator of the greater eternal truth of the integrity of Adonai Himself. Trials came to God's children through the ages, Satan's claims proven by the faithful to be always in vain, by the power to overcome through the grace of the Victorious Lord.<br /><br />God's theological Dialogue:<br />Nottingham patristic, Dr. G. Bebawi who directed the Jewish project of U. of Cambridge, wrote Under this title, \\"Do God and Satan talk? This attitude finds in the poetical character of the book the best argument that like all poetry, some parts must be taken as a parable. We will miss the message of the book if we jump into the deep end of the literal studies. It is important to realize that the Book of Job is a narrative. That is, it is arranged as a chronological account of a series of events. It is a mixture of prose and poetry, as is the Pentateuch. It tells of the experiences of an exceptionally blameless and pious individual who was also a very wealthy and prosperous person, and how he was struck down as the result of an argument in heaven between God and a subordinate being, Satan, losing his wealth, his family, his health and his self-respect and social status.\\"<br /><br />Job in Talmud & Midrash:<br />In Sefer Ha Aggadah, we read the following account: A certain sage who was sitting before Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said: Job never was and never existed - he is no more than a paradigm. Rabbi Samuel replied: To confound such as you, Scripture says, \\"There was a man in the land of Uz, Job was his name.\\" (Job 1:1). The sage retorted: If it is as you say, what of the verse \\"The poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and reared,\\" etc.(2 Sam. 12:3)? Did such a thing really happen? Was not the tale a paradigm? So, too, Job was a paradigm. Rabbi Samuel said: But if so, why are his name and the name of his land mentioned?' Jewish traditions, confirm that Job was not a Hebrew as we read. Resh Lakish said: Job [described in Scripture] never was and never existed. What did Resh Lakish mean by saying Job never was and never existed? He meant only that the unbelievable sufferings Job underwent according to Scripture [took place]. Why then were they set down about him? Because if they had come upon him, he would have not been able to withstand them. Rabbi Hanina said: Job was a Gentile. For, Rabbi Hiyya taught, the Holy One said: One righteous Gentile rose up for Me among the nations. So I gave him [extraordinary] reward [in this world] and let him go. Who was He? Job. (Babylonian Talmud)<br /><br />Christians on Job:<br />\\"The early Fathers of the church considered Job a historical person. The Book of Job was written in poetry and in prose, which opened the book for much criticism as if poetry is not good enough for God and humanity to be a way of communication. The scene in heaven, where we see almost a kind of conference where God, the Angels and Satan are assembled (1:6; 2:1) has been debated as plainly an allegory.\\" Dr. G. Bebawi While J. Danielou, E. Renan, and H. Rowley elaborate on mystery, soul's cry, and intellectually spiritual solutions. Ehrenberg concentrates on the non compassionate theology of Job's companion Elihu! Ragaz gives an ultimate clue; God Himself is the answer. The message of the suffering servant prophetically revealed by Isaiah, was fulfilled in Jesus Christ the redeemer.(Isaiah 53:1:12)<br />\\"Thus at every step in what is called, a little misleadingly, the evolution of a story, a man, all he is and all his attitudes, are involved. And no good work is done anywhere without aid from the Father of Lights. When a series of such retellings turns a creation story which at first had almost no religious or metaphysical significance into a story which achieves the idea of true Creation and of a transcendent Creator, then nothing will make me believe that some of the re-tellers, or some one of them, has not been guided by God.\\" C.

Accordingly, the abbot of St. Macarius narrates in his tightly packed confession of Orthodox Christianity the tradition of 16 centuries on Alexandrine tradition of salvation and it's history, through the narrow way, always tried for those who received the monastic habit: sometimes missed or achieved, and few times mastered by the ascetic desert dwellers.<br /><br />20 Thematic essays:<br />The book starts from its logical beginning: \\"How to read the Bible\\", and takes you in twenty steps: chapters of 10 pages each to the Eschatological Unity of John 17 in its last two chapters. This book whose 20 concise but instructive chapters focus on the Living Christ of history and faith, reveals goal and essence of Christian living. Fr. Matthew uses simple, yet profound imagery of the typical ascetic tradition of Coenobitic communities of Sketes and Kellia in the Egyptian desert. The subjects of the essays contain some typical Orthodox issues: Humility, Asceticism, Repentance, fasting, and Suffering.

Yuhanna was a learned presbyter as was the tradition for sons of Oriental Christian families in some parts of the Islamic Empire. Later on he became a hermit joining one of the monasteries in the region. During the great schism of the iconoclastic controversy that tormented the neighboring Byzantine empire,in the 8th century, John wrote his three apologies against those who sought to destroy icons, to prevent all traces of iconic worship.<br /><br />The Theological debate:<br /><br />St. John's defense is a basic reading for Christians interested in iconography,its orthodoxy, and theological defense.Yuhanna starts by differentiating between the veneration given to Saints and their icons and the worship offered only to the Heavenly Lord. His defense of icons is supported by Church tradition of the veneration of the relics of Saints in a 3rd & 4th century. The cult of martyrs and protector saints grew accumulating many inherited rituals from balming with fragrants, to safekeeping, revering their relics, and painting icons for the saints.<br /><br />He claims that \\"Since Christ is fully God and was fully man, He sanctified matter during his earthly ministry, including it in the scheme of salvation, baptism in water, communion of His body in bnread and wine. The body must not be seen as evil, a remnant Gnostic view in the early Church. St. John refers to Alexandrine salvation theology of redemption through Theosis, as elaborated by St. Athanasius.He avoids St Cyril's Sotereology, Eucharist is the presence of Christ among us. He used St. Gregory allegation:\\"Whatever is not assumed, cannot be redeemed\\".  Christ took upon him our human flesh, so that we can be redeemed in His incarnational nature. Our Lord IC XC redeemed the whole universe, including humanity. Icons, are pictorial representation of a transcendental reality that could be defended in the same context. The theology behind the icons; St. John debates is how the reality of the Incarnation must be safeguarded. Defending the Chaledonian position, he argued that Jesus the Christ was the \\"Icon\\" of God, the incorporeal and uncircumscribed. He defends;\\" I do not worship matter, but I worship the Creator of matter, who for my sake became material and deigned to dwell in matter, who through matter effected my salvation. I will not cease from worshipping the matter through which my salvation has been effected.\\" !?<br /><br />Aversion to images in Doxology:<br /><br />The miaphysite theology dominated the Empire even after Islam. The most formidable theologian were Copts and Syrians on both sides but largely miaphysites. Severus of Antioch, Theodosius of Alexandria, john of Damascus and later Maximus the Confessor represented the main stream and never refuted Icons. That is why both Eastern and Oriental Orthodox venerate icons, the Orientals put less emphasis on the rituals.<br /><br />The use of images in Christian worship was controversial during St. John's time (8th Century) as is still today for many Christians. Aversion to images in Church worship is obviously a complicated topic and still unacceptable by many Christians, most Protestants, some Catholics, and few Oriental Orthodox, who first introduced the Icons for teaching purposes. Some argue that even if icons are acceptable for all saints, even thinking of our Lord and Redeemer Jesus Christ in a three dimensional or spatial way is primitive if not heretic. Since He is One with the Father in the unconceived Trinity in Unity, He is God appearing in flesh.<br /><br />Praying in Spirit and Truth?<br /><br />The dominant Miaphysites theology, would not totally support this logic. Since it was more concerned with the unity of the person of Christ, something an Iconcannot demonstrate how Divine nature could be revealed. The close association of Melkite worship with icon veneration was tied to Byzantine understanding of the concept \\"image\\"  of God, that Christ renew by His incarnation. The debates on Christology in the 6th century at the time of the great Christologists Severus of Antioch and john Philoponus,  never died out but always regenerated into new shapes, appeared first time in the Theopachite declaration, and thereafter in Apophatic theology written by the Syrian Miaphysite mystic under the pseudonym Dionysius the Areoopagite.<br /><br />An Orthodox via Media:<br /><br />Alexandrian Orthodoxy is best reflected in their mystics; Abba Kyrillos Thematurge, the holy wonder worker addressing the Saints through their icons being the victorious Church.The mystical view of the miaphysites theology of love and fellowship may be portrayed best by the Coptic Icon of Our Lord protecting St. Menas, a martyr!

He creatively transmitted the essence of Coptic spirituality that deeply influenced Oriental and Western Christian thinkers from John Cassian to Simeon the new theologian, and his influence is still felt today between R. Catholics, through Jerome and Rufinus, but above all within the Benedictines and Cisterians. Thus spake Fr. Leclercq in his preface.<br /><br />Evagrius, and Prayer<br />Evagrius' training, life, and related spiritual writings, in the context of the 'discipline of psalmody' as practiced by his contemporary monastic, and his underlining of the use of contemplation in the healing of passions, are typical Sketes ascetical traditions. Biblical scholia when closely studied, may facilitate what Evagrius has called 'undistracted psalmody', that is, contemplation by means of the words used in psalms of the person of Christ and of Christ's salvific work within his acts in creation, and redemption, a pioneering tradition, first taught by his grand master Origen.<br /><br />153 chapters on Prayer<br />Following master Origen, Evagrius identifies contemplation with monastic life, prayer and spirituality, to martyrdom being a sign of perfection.  Written, possibly to Rufinus, the 153 here correspond to the large fish in John 21:11. His expressions are typically of the desert: the gift of tears, striving for a deaf mind,and flower of meekness, and fruit of joy and thanksgiving.

The preface is key to Atiya's philosophy of Church history, &#34;Though conscious of the controversial character of some of my arguments, I have decided to relinquish even the most provocative among them so long as they have any foundation in available source material.&#34; Seven maps introduce you to the geography of the early Christian world, and the regional facts of the time.<br /><br />Eastern Christianity at a glance:<br />Part I: Alexandrine Christianity:<br />  The ancient patriarchate of Alexandria was one of the chief sees of the early church. The Copts, descendants of the ancient Egyptians, never assumed their Church ethnic identity untill after the Arab invasion of the  Byzantine empire.  Through a long period of persecution since Byzantine domination of the East, the Orthodox Church in Egypt tenaciously held fast to the &#34;faith of the fathers&#34;, preserving the Coptic language in their liturgy. One of its main strengths was in continuing the ascetic and monastic traditions originated by the Egyptian deserts fathers. The church has initiated considerable missionary work early in its ministry in europe and British Isles, recently in other parts of the African continent, and has a significant diaspora in North America, Europe, Australia and the Middle East.<br />  The Ethiopian church has a history going back to apostolic times. For long under the tutelage of the Church of Alexandria. In 1959, the Coptic patriarch consecrated the Ethiopian Abuna as Catholicos of the Church of Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa. The church uses both the ancient language of Geez and modern Amharic in its liturgy, and has produced considerable religious literature with its own icon tradition.<br />  The Eritrean Orthodox Church is an autocephalous church, depending directly on the See of St. Mark , got its Catholicos and Synod in recent years, after separation of Eritria from Ethiopia.<br /><br />Part II; Antioch and the Jacobites<br />  The Syrian Orthodox Church traces its history to the early traditions of St Peter's work, Christians were first called by their name in Antioch. The church suffered severe persecution during the struggle against Byzantine domination after the council of Chalcedon, and later through  invasions and Islamic rule. The patriarchate had to be moved several times until it was established in Damascus during this century. Syrian liturgical and theological life flourished until the 13th century, and became an inspiration to the Coptic Church which was in desolation, but steadily declined afterwards. The monastic movement produced many universally acknowledged saints and contributed enormously to the creation of a rich liturgical tradition.<br /><br />In the seventeenth century, the Antiochian church came into contact with the ancient church of St Thomas Christians in India, and W. Syrian liturgy was thus introduced to the Christians in South India. Though the Syrian church is vastly reduced in number, it has a considerable diaspora in the US, Australia and Europe.<br /><br />Part IV; The Armenian Church<br />  The Armenian Apostolic Church: Armenia is the first nation to accept Christianity as the official religion traditionally Orthodox Christianity is linked with the preaching of St Thaddeus and St Bartholomew. Armenian Christians heroically preserved their apostolic faith, and were victims of terrible persecution through the centuries.  There are three ecclesiastical centres within the church apart from Armenia: the catholicate of Cilicia (Antelias, Lebanon), the patriarchate of Jerusalem and the patriarchate of Constantinople. The Armenian church has a very significant diaspora spread out in all the continents. The Armenian national aspirations and the Armenian Orthodox faith are integrally interconnected.<br /><br />  The Malankara (Indian) Orthodox Church has always cherished the tradition of St Thomas as the founding father of Christianity in India. The Indian church,  has suffered from Western colonial missions. The church came into contact with the west Syrian patriarchate of Antioch in 1665 and thus inherited the Syrian liturgical and spiritual tradition. The Orthodox church in India declared itself autocephalous in 1912, though conflicts with the Syrian patriarchate continue. With a well- equipped theological college, a mission training centre and many educational and charitable institutions, the church is fully involved in the life of the country. With the catholicos residing in Kerala. It has a diaspora in North America, Malaysia, Singapore and the Gulf countries.<br /><br />The Late A. S.

This book stands my Criterion: If I only have one book on the subject, I would buy this book. This book is methodical, written basically for Seminarians, still tickles your curious bone, but don't get tricked by the smoothness of his elaboration, being a top exegesist and a reference on biblical criticism.<br />Preface & Chapter one:<br />Read the condensed preface attentively, it highlights Prof. Bruce intended strategy to leave the more controversial issues on the OT canon to R. Beckwith and J. Barton. The short chapter defines terms that became the vocabulary of the subject, their meaning and roots. 'People of the Book' conveys his cultural standing, but he avoids elaborating on the concept of the two testaments but will not but mention Jeremiah 31:31, and later how Origen was the first to use and propagate this Alexandrine terminology (p. 192 : on First Principles 4.1.1)<br /><br />TaNaKh & Wider Canon:<br />Bruce, who said will shy from OT canon, masterfully instructs us in his own way, starting from the authority of OT for a Christian: Jesus appeal to TaNaKh, going from the threefold division to the closing of the Hebrew canon in Jabneh. Now, with a firm foot, he delves into the Alexandrine wider Canon starting with Septuagint origin, order of books, and adoption as Ancient Churches OT, and NT evidence, but does not state citations or allusions to the Apocrypha (K. & B. Aland: The text of the NT, Eerdmans, 1979) that he mentions (p. 51)<br /><br />OT Christian Canon: Prevalence of Alexandria<br />The Rylands chair for two decades enlighten us on how one Church transmitted the light for all others. He starts by stating the authority of the early Uncials, Alexandrinus, Sinaiticus, and Vaticanus that are all products of the Alexandrine Scriptorium, and are the most reliable (contrary of Ehrman's thesis). Along side other easterners, he elaborates on Origen, and Athanasius, the first to use the term Canon, in relation to scripture.<br />Very interesting is his review of 17th and 18th centuries accomodation of canon, and Biblical societies. The canon in the West: Tertullian, Jerome, Augustine, to the reformation: Luther, Erasmus, and Tyndale through Trentine Council to KJAV.<br /><br />New Testament Canon:<br />If I would propose any clarification to this enjoyable treatise, it would be to copy the names and order of the bible in Orthodox, Catholic, and protestant traditions from a good study Bible, say the Harper Collins NRSV, with Apocrypha. Although differences exist in OT books, NT books are the exact 27 books. Only that the order of books in a genuine Orthodox Bible follows the Order of St. Athanasius in his Pascal letter of 367, the Catholic Epistles precede the Pauline letters.<br /><br />Hebrews and Apocalypse:<br />The authority of Dionysius the Great, on the Apocalypse of John, followed by all the Orientals (p. 213) in spite of their Canonical diversity was never challenged by Athanasius letter, intended to compromise Rome with the eastern Church. He persauded the Romans to accept the book of Hebrews, next only to John's Bible in the Alexandrine NT theological priority (canon within the canon) of the Didaskalia and Catechetical School, compromising for the Apocalypse, then considered a liturgical text in the East.<br /><br />Great Chapters to enjoy:<br />The Alexandrian Fathers<br />NT canon in the Age of printing<br />Criteria of Canonicity<br />A Canon within the Canon<br />Canon ,Criticism and interpretation<br /><br />Further Readings:<br />* Barr, J. \\"Holy Scripture: Canon, Authority, Criticism,<br />Westminster press, Philadelphia, 1983<br />* Beckwith,R. \\"The Old Testament Canon of NT Church,...\\"<br />Eerdmans, Gr.

The Arabic Bible stood out amongst its output, started by Rev. Eli Smith and completed by Dr. Cornilius van Dyck, the Reformed Dutch Church missionary. The break through came bye half a century later in Egypt when the Presbyterian mission started to establish its credibility as a necessity for personal piety. For the last six or seven decades it firmly established its position as the Protestant Bible translation for the ancient Coptic Orthodox Church.<br />The Van Dyck Translation:<br />At the time this translation was completed its goal was to make available the word of God in mid nineteenth century Arabic. It was a literal translation since this was the available practice of the day. Although modern Arabic translations take into consideration the same criteria of master Eugene Nida and associates (Toward a science of translating, Brill, 1964), this could not have been the case then. This translation has similar pros and cons of the English king James Version.<br />How does it rate;<br />This translation was cherished by Arabic speaking Christians of the Middle East. In the late eighties, the evangelical press published an Arabic lexicon to explain the outdated Arabic which older generations could understand, this is a small but voluminous one (about 200 pages) Carsons assessment of biblical Translation (the Bible in the twenty-first Century, Howard Kee, editor, ABS, 1993) were not met but the Bible is not a simple book.	2002-09-10

Eli Smith with the help of the Lebanese scholars B. Albustani and poet N. Al-Yazgi, no effort was made to modernise the hard to understand outdated arabic. The Anglican publishing house printed an Arabic Lexicon to explain the uncommon Arabic words.<br />How unique is this edition?<br />Very unique indeed. The Jesuits revised the Newtestament in 1969 after almost 100 years, and the old Testament from 1980 to 1988. The Bible Society wanted one translation accepted by the vast majority of orthodox, mainly Coptic and evangelically active minority.<br />  Here comes the Orthodox Church tradition: the Controlling authority of the Septuagint and the wider Alexandrine Canon. Athanasius rule to the Catholic Church, detailed in his Pascal letter 367, still applicable in the Coptic Church of Alexandria. The only  difference is the sequence. The Catholic epistles are followed by the Pauline letters.<br />An Arabic Study Bible?<br />Sure, and a genuinely good annotated Bible, that avoids dictating dogmatic influenced interpretations, with simply commonly agreed footnotes, of scholarly proven facts, explanations and comments. Four colored maps and two indicative sketches, are helpful tools for all students, together with general introduction and brief introductions for each book.<br />An ecumenical effort for Bible translation into modern Arabic coordinated by the ever active Bible society in the Middle East. Maronite Catholic scholarship (mainly society of Jesus), hand in hand with the continious efforts of the evangelical missions, and participation of some lay Orthodox concluded this monumental work.<br />Translation principles and rules:<br />  So beautiful is the statement of faith &quot;Throughout history, Bible scholars labored with great erudite and hard work to recover and preserve the original text unblemished&quot; The goal was ultimately rendering in Middle Eastern Arabic speakers a simple modern Arabic language understood by a wide spectrum readership.

Because the Son is God from God, in some mysterious way he passes this honor on to us.\\"  St Cyril of Alexandria, Pillar of Faith<br /><br />Alexandrian versus Antiochene Theology :<br />The Alexandrines based their Christology on john 1:14 amending it mystically with 1 Tim 3:16. They explained the Logos-sarx union with the soul-body analogy to illustrate the substantial union, an ontological oneness, between divinity and humanity in Christ. The rival theology of the Antiochenes employed the soul-body analogy to explain how the Divinity and humanity united in Christ without loosing their full integrity.<br /><br />Cyril of Alexandria:<br />Cyril of Alexandria, the Christological champion for Orthodoxy, developed and exalted the theology of the famous school of Alexandria (Catechetical Didaskalia) He was trained by his uncle Theophilus of Alexandria, followed faithfully the Tradition of Alexandria from Clement, and Origen to Athanasius and Didymus, the blind. He was a great biblical expositor, and his christology is Bible based.Thomas Weinandy, debates that Cyril is the first, if not the only patristic theologian to employ the soul-body analogy properly, for different Church fathers conceive the union in Christ depending on their carrier philosophy, Aristotelian or neo- platonic. Every party, after Chalcedon, claimed to express what Cyril expounded and defended, one nature of the incarnate Logos, fully divine and genuinely human, which expressed the dual aspects in a harmonius and coordinated way. He builds on Athanasius theological defence of the divinity of the Son, and accordingly perfected the orthodox doctrine of theopesis, salvation by participation in the divine nature.<br /><br />On The unity of Christ:<br />Fr. john McGukin, a patristic scholar, who teaches Early Church History, has revisited the controversial debate on one of the turning doctrines of the early Church.

Witt<br />*<br /><br />Cyril christological Imagery<br />The Alexandrian typology tradition of utilizing symbol and narrative, specifically to the person and work of Jesus Christ for our salvation, transforms the stories and symbols of the gospels to build our conceptions of God, Christ, and the world. As had been the case earlier with the doctrine of the Trinity, Cyril realized that it was necessary to posit the union of incarnation at the level of person, not that of nature.<br /><br />Like Athanasius and his Alexandrine predecessors, Cyril's core interest in Christology was finally soteriological. Cyril's concern for orthodoxy was guided by a clear understanding of the need for human redemption. Cyril consistently uses imagery, of iron glowing while maintained into fire, or bread dipped into wine, to illustrate the change brought by the incarnate Word to his body. As iron, when heated, becomes enhanced with heat energy of fire, so by uniting himself to his flesh, the life-giving Word endowed it with life-giving power.<br /><br />Since the assumed body of the Word is life-giving, having been united hypostatically to his divine nature, those who \\"partake of his holy body and blood are quickened in all respects, and wholly, the Word dwelling in us divinely through the Holy Spirit, humanly again through his holy flesh and precious blood.\\" Through partaking of the one body of Christ in the Eucharist, those who believe in Christ are united with his risen body and with each other. The Church is, therefore, Christ's body, and believers are individually his members.<br /><br />Reconstructing Cyril's Christology<br />This thesis on Cyril's work and thought is another volume in the elite Patristic theological supplements: Vigiliae Christianae. \\"Whether we understand the person and work of Christ to be constitutive of a salvation, says Witt, we can find nowhere else, or rather whether we find the person and work of Christ to be illustrative of a salvation which is really universally available marks a fundamental divide in theology.\\"<br /><br />McKinion studied Alexandrine theology, in defence of the person and meaning of Christ's works, reflecting on Cyril's Soteriology. His knowledge earned him love, as Philo's Love with the Eyes of understanding (Q on Genesis). He did that early in his patristic career, much earlier than Grillmeier, WHC Frend, Dragas, and where great dogmatic theologians like Von Harnack and JND Kelley missed the ball defending Leo Tome and Chalcedon.<br /><br />Steven McKinion declares his support for \\"one hypostasis from the two natures,\\"as we observe a further similar perspective of this hypostasic union of Cyril's: `the Son is as perfect in His humanity as in His Divinity, because he is simultaneously God and man...the hypostasis are not to be divided or separated from one another,'quotes Mckinion. Welcome to the mystical understanding of the one person in Hypostatic union.<br /><br />Quotation/ Conclusion<br />-\\"Even a cursory reading of the volumes left by Cyril of Alexandria reveals the perennial presence of Christological images, word pictures that are found throughout his many attempts to explain his understanding of an Orthodox picture of Christ\\"<br />- \\"The Alexandrines defended the deity of Christ through a theory of kenosis, whereby God the Word descended to the level of humanity by truly becoming man.\\" (p. 11)<br /><br />Mckinion composed a sonata on Cyril's pictoristic Chrtistology utilizing beautiful melodies from Grillmeier, Hallman, Hanson, and Louth. No conclusion could be better than the authors epilogue: \\"the controversial life of Cyril of Alexandria ended on June 27, 444 (July 10 in the Coptic Calendar) in Alexandria.

Prayer is in fact the core of Christian life, and the backbone of this marvelous work, where he explained conducting oneself with respect to examining and silencing the thoughts with humility. Love is the goal in which a faithful should abide through contemplation.<br />His smaller work \\"the Book of Privy Counseling,\\" is a more mature but moving treatise on attaining salvation by enlightenment through kenosis (self denial).

Ware, in Study of Spirituality p176), carried to Europe as \\"The Jesus Prayer,\\" through the Praktikos of Evagrius Ponticos.In chapter 38 of the Cloud, this holy English mystic speaks of a little prayer of one syllable Kyriya Elaison (Lord have mercy) that is powerful enough to pierce the heavens.<br />Origen was the initiator of the Apophatic concept (commentary on song of Songs), carrying over from Philo, based on roots that go all the way to Asaph, Ps 73:21-24. But, the crystallization of the whole theology took final shape in the writings of a Syrian monk of early six century of pseudonym Dionysius the Areopagite (who was probably a student or companion of Severus of Antioch), taking to himself the name of St. Paul's Athenian disciple.<br />The wave of Mystical Milieu:<br />During 14th and 15th century Europe, a pilgrimage to the unknown God started by Eckhart and his fellow Dominicans Susa and Tauler based on spiritual poverty. In England, Rolle, Hilton, and Julian of Norwich took the same road. These were all disciples in the school of negation. The influence came through John Scotus who in the ninth century translated the corpus Dionysium into Latin, initiating a chain of commentaries from Aquinas, Bonaventure, and Gallus.

When was the last time you witnessed a joyful silence, a rapturous silence? When have you heard some raconteur relay a congenial encounter with silence.\\" Jane H. Kay<br /><br />\\"I am drawn more and more to the mystical Christ. I always was. There was always something much deeper than words for me. Much emphasis is spent on studying the Word, and while I must admit that the Word speaks deeply to me it is the \\"non-word\\" that speaks even more.\\" Fr. Bob Struzynski, OFM<br /><br />Encounters with Silence:<br />Encountering Silence is one of Karl Rahner's most inspiring and mystifying books. A book of meditations about man's relation with God, Rahner's classics of modern spirituality, is cast in the form of a dialogue with God that moves from earnest inquiry to peaceful contemplation. This book of prayerful reflections on love, with obedience, in knowledge, and faith transforms daily routines, spanning life with our Family and friends, that covers our work and vocation. The power of this moving work is a tribute to its mere truth and simple practicality. A  great theologian, Rahner, who could easily communicate in profound and touching language to wandering lay men and women, who look for inspiration for their inner life, one that never forsakes the world of reality.<br /><br />The heart of all things:<br />\\"It must become progressively manifest to the world that the heart of all things is already transformed, because you have taken them all to your heart. ...The false appearance of our world, ... that it has not been liberated... must be more and more thoroughly rooted out. . . . And your coming is neither past nor future, but the present, which has only to reach its fulfillment. Now it is still the one single hour of your advent.\\"  Encounters with Silence<br /><br />A Contemporary desert father:<br />\\" The Christian of the future will be a mystic or he will not exist at all,\\" prophicies Karl Rahner.<br />In this moving work by the great mystic who expresses in modern language the daily utterance of the early saintly abbas and ammas of the Church, it is hardly not in order, that a Roman Catholic theologian utters these prayers of the noia (heart of thinking) in his ever continuous self transformation, sanctification by grace, a divinization through the Holy Spirit.<br />In his book: The Spirit in the Church (Seabury,1979); he appropriates 'The testimony of the mystics,' \\"they experience grace, the direct presence of God, and union with Him in the Spirit, in the sacred night, or in a blessed illumination, in a void silence filled with God.\\"<br /><br />God of my life:<br />When I abandon myself in love, then You are my very life, ... The farther Your infinity is removed from my nothingness, the greater is the challenge to my love.<br /><br />God of my Lord Jesus Christ:<br />Grant, O infinite God, that I may ever cling fast to Jesus Christ, my Lord. ....... But I have still one more request. Make my heart like that of Your Son.!<br /><br />God of my prayer:<br />How can a man hope to speak with You? .......How can I pray with love, when the prayer of love is the absolute surrender of the heart from its deepest roots,...?<br /><br />God of knowledge:<br />Truly my God, mere knowledge is nothing. .....how can we approach the heart of all things, the true heart of reality? Not by knowledge alone, but by the full flower of knowledge, love.<br /><br />God of Law:<br />But, Lord, what of the commandments imposed upon us by men, issued in your name?.......The burden about which I was complaining in the stillness of my heart is mainly our burden, the burden of Your priests,.......set upon our own shoulders.<br /><br />Enjoy the above quotations:<br />Read this book, before you pray, even if you do not pray, since you will discover you are in a continuos prayer, with the whole universe even if not aware of it. (Ps.19:1-4)<br /><br />The Mystic, a Theologian:<br />Impelled by his Ignatian mysticism of joy in the world--of finding God in all things and all things in God, Rahner's theology moves in two directions. He compresses all Christianity into three mysteries--Trinity, incarnation, and grace. He also unfolds these mysteries into every dimension of human life, even into a \\"theology of everyday things\\"--a theology of work, of seeing, of laughing, of eating and sleeping, and of walking and sitting. And if his theology of compression often involves anfractuous dialectics dealing with questions about the triune God, the Word made flesh, and our divinization through the Holy Spirit, his theology of unfolding can be as lovely as advising an unwed mother in her darkest hour to look into the face of her newborn for light.

I walked back home with a broken heart, why should those called &quot;Christians&quot; fight over a word, why of and in two natures make that serious difference. Behold, if this book was written thirty years earlier!It could have helped to heal the wound of knowledge of the smitten kid.<br />Who do people say 'I Am'?<br />Now Dr. Hart; using his talents as a professor and counselor; tells us in a friendly way what Baillie, Rahner, Schoonenberg, Tillich, and others. In a concise and clear English he leads us through the overwhelming and confusing flood of recent studies about Jesus Christ (as : our lord and Savior)<br />Chalcedon and the historical Jesus:<br />Now Thomas in the same spirit of his namesake formulates his critique of Chalcedon, and invites R. Brown, J. Fitzmyer, J.Knox, using the scripture as the vital source for philosophy. He questions Thomas Aquinas use of Aristotelian philosophy, and even dares to state&quot; The New Testament does not speak of two natures in one person,...&quot; Now he rightly qualifies Chalcedon : &quot;a monument in the history of theological reflections on Jesus&quot;<br />To follow Jesus, know him:<br />This is the beauty of this book, Thomas N. Hart (N. may stand for his description as Neo-thomist or more properly Neo-Scolastic), leads us in the way of knowledge (ch. 1-5): I. The experience of salvation, II. Christian discipleship, V. The inner experience of Jesus.

Liturgy is the work of the laity and ministry for their life in the spirit, a real participation in the mystical body of Christ.
