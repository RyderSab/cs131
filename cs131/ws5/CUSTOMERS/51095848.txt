The North Korean capital of Pyongyang was effectively flattened during the Korean War (1950-53) and its rebuilding reflected a series of political choices from what sorts of activities to locate in the capital to what kind of architectural design, materials, and construction techniques to employ. Springer mines this intersection of cityscape and political history beautifully, and it is hard to imagine anyone who would not learn something new from reading this book.	2004-09-07

It is particularly apropos during an election centered, to a strange degree, on events 30 to 40 years ago. <br /> <br />The book focuses on two iconic public figures, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, who each successfully constructed alternative interpretations of the 1950s and 1960s and rode them to the White House.  In some sense Reagan's was the simpler task, using his personal charisma to frame a nostalgia evoking American dominance and stability, \\"a chronology of 1950s normality, 1960s deviance and trauma, 1970s hangover and stagnation, and a 1980s return to health and glory,\\" aimed at a largely white and male core political constituency for whom such a narrative did not do tremendous violence to their personal interests.    <br /> <br />Clinton's task was harder-as Marcus observes, \\"American imaginations find it difficult to hold onto the image of an antimilitaristic, psychedelicized, left-wing white southerner.\\" But Clinton managed to turn the trick, reaching back to JFK and Elvis as his touchstones.  Indeed, Marcus argues that the death of George Bush's southern guitar-picking political advisor Lee Atwater deprived him of the one political hand who might have had the cultural instincts to fashion a successful counter to Elvis as Policy Wonk, and with an assist from Ross Perot, Clinton went on to win in 1992.  <br /> <br />Reading this well-written book one wonders what Marcus would have made of the media's hagiographic treatment of Reagan at the time of his death, or the weirdly backward looking focus of the current presidential election campaign.  But it is precisely that backward gaze which demonstrates the contemporary relevance of this book. <br />	2004-09-05

He has some fundamental insights and pursues them with an unstinting through the novel, and whether in the end one agrees or finds them persuasive or not, it must be granted that he is putting more on the table than the vast majority of contemporary novelists.  If I had any criticism or disappointment with the writing, it is that the sex in the novel is essentially pornographic  it is a fantasy ideal where nothing ever goes awry  but then perhaps in a novel directed at an alienated Western audience, that is the point.      <br />With respect to Islam, Houellebecq has some hard things to say, but this should be viewed is in the context of a more general critique of the desert religions (as one of his characters calls them) and their rigorous codes of sex and death.  If, as one reviewer noted, there is a plea for Catholicism, my impression is that this is more a plea for catholicism with a lower case c.  Houellebecq argues through his main protagonist that Catholicism is to be preferred to Judaism, Islam, or Protestantism in the specific sense its very lack of rigor makes it a more tolerant and accepting, and ultimately humane, faith.  I interpret this as less promoting Roman Catholicism as a religion than upholding the values of tolerance and acceptance. Houellebecq seems comfortable with Buddhism  there is a reason that much of the novel takes place in Thailand. Islam comes into his line of fire precisely because of the Abrahamic religions, it is the one of which today some of its adherents have had greatest difficulty with the transition to modernity, manifested in the intolerance depicted in the novel.<BR> <BR>Which brings me to the ending. Not to give away the plot, but it is frankly hard to read the novel without the Bali bombing echoing in ones head, reinforcing the emotional impact of this interesting, difficult novel.	2003-12-11

The emphasis is almost proportional in distance in time from today:  the monograph is strongest on pre-Spanish history, the narrative more or less peters out post-Independence, and Arcilla is careful not to make value judgments about contemporary Filipino leaders such as Ferdinand Marcos. Yet this is not without value to those interested in the Philippines today - reading the section on banditry and insurgency in Mindanao in the 1500s one cannot help but reading into Arcilla's narrative a remarkable continuity to the present.	2003-11-30

Two of the standout pieces from this mold are South African journalist Rian Malan (author of the incredible memoir \\"My Traitor's Heart\\") on the vicissitudes of the continuing legal wrangling over \\"Wimoweh\\" in which New York business sharks in essence defrauded its illiterate South African writer Solomon Lindo who died in poverty; and Nick Tosches funny piece on a group of now elderly wiseguys reminiscing on the underworld connections that made 1950s-1960s rock and roll.  Granta editor Bill Buford contributes a very revealing portrait of alt-country singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams.  Three unusual and enjoyable pieces are alt.country singer-songwriter Robbie Fulks' encounter with the IRS (think low-rent Willie Nelson), the fan letter of Jonathan Lethem (editor of the subsequent 2002 collection) to the Go-Betweens, and Jim DeRogatis' acrimonious interview with Third Eye Blind singer Stephan Jenkins in which he invites Jenkins to give as good as he gets.

And what a season it was - Lyle goes from Cy Young award winner to set-up man as he is beat out for the closer job by the younger, faster, stronger Goose Gossage.  At the same time Lyle is trying to deal with his professional decline, the Yankees make an astounding comeback, catch the Red Sox, beat the Royals in the ALCS and then win the World Series defeating the Dodgers.  But the real focus of the book (or at least Lyle's attention) is off-the-field - especially the interaction with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner and Lyle's demands to salvage his professional honor and career.  In a sort of sad post-script Lyle got his wish and was traded to the Rangers, yet never reattained the form that made him the Cy Young winner in 1977.	2003-11-30

This installment of the Da Capo \\"Best Music Writing\\" series features a wide range of pieces both stylistically and in terms of subject matter.  Nik Cohn's article \\"Soljas\\" on the New Orleans rap scene, originally published in Granta, is an astonishing piece of writing and would deserve to be in a collection of \\"Best Writing of 2002,\\" music-oriented or not.  Three other contributions are striking for their biographical writing, illuminating broader, non-musical themes:  RJ Smith on the LA enigma Korla Pandit, Michael Hall on Texas psychedelic rocker Roky Ericson, and Matthew C.

In effect the story is told in two parts - the author's life up to his father's hanging on trumped up charges in 1995, and his subsequent attempt to come to terms with his fathers ambiguous personal legacy, in part from seeking out the children of other political martyrs such as Nkosinathi Biko and Aung San Suu Kyi.

The problem is that the very vastness of the desert, which makes it romantic, arduous, and forbidding, also makes it difficult to translate into prose.  As a result there is a certain sameness to the ramshackle procession of now dilapidated desert towns though which the Marozzi and his companion travel - the dramatic highpoints, like the hovels, are few and far between, such as when one of the camels falls into a trench and nearly dies.  With little social interest material to work with, Marozzi contrasts his own experiences with the diaries and travelogues of mostly 19th century explorers and abolitionists. The result is interesting, but more understated and less obviously accessible than say the books of Redmond O'Hanlon. Nevertheless, it is quite a tale, and it is apparent that with the dying out of the camel culture embodied by one of their guides, the 76 year old Tubbu nomad, Mohammed Othman, the depiction of an experience that will soon be impossible to relive, if it is even now.	2003-05-11

Although it is fair to say that little if any of this perspective would be accepted by contemporary social scientists, the book is fascinating in retrospect as it documents McClelland and Co.'s attempts to quantify the \\"achievement motive\\" for example by scoring the content of folk tales, elementary school reading primers, and popular music, and then the linkage of these measures to other social outcomes, complete with ex post rationalizations of the results (or lack of results) obtained in these exercises.	2003-04-04

Author Brian Glasser argues that this book is a \\"portrait\\" rather than a biography, aiming for emotional truth over factual specificity.  Whatever the intent, the book views Zawinul very much through the prism of his music with the emphasis on the subject's musical career and very little on his life beyond music making. It is not an authorized biography in the sense of after giving Glasser several interviews, Zawinul apparently withdrew his cooperation, forcing Glasser to cobble together much of the book from previously published interviews and accounts. The result is a certain unevenness to the story - aspects of Zawinul's childhood are covered in a fair amount of detail, but in contrast it is only mentioned in passing that at a certain point Zawinul was married and had a family; later, we again learn in passing that his wife is named Maxine, that she is African-American, similarly the names of their children crop up sort of randomly etc.  <br />In some respects this is not a major drawback - the emphasis is rightly on Zawinul's music, and many (most?) readers will already be acquainted with the basic facts of his life.  Yet, it would appear to be an extraordinary life, and it is a pity that it is not the subject of a more polished biography.	2003-04-03

Some of the repetition is due to Feinstein's need to describe \\"the punch\\" to establish the need to delve into the lives of the protagonists, Kermit Washington (the punch thrower) and Rudy Tomjanovich (the punch recipient).  Feinstein then begins telling each of their stories through alternating chapters.  By the time he gets to their meeting on 9 December 1977 the confrontation is anticlimactic, in light of the detailed analysis that opens the book.  <br />From a normative perspective, the punch and its aftermath can be summed up in three quotes from former NBA players.  On Washington's culpability, as Calvin Murphy points out \\"Your first instinct is to protect yourself. You hear someone coming from behind, you turn and get your hands up.  Then, if you need to throw a punch, you throw it.  Kermit, turned, saw Rudy clearly, and threw the punch.  He was angry.  He wanted to hurt somebody.  Not in the way he did, I know that.  But this wasn't an act of self-defense.  If it had been, he would have just been covering up\\" (page 52).<br />On Tomjanovich's contribution, according to Wes Unseld \\"There is no one I respect more in the game than Rudy Tomjanovich, but he got himself into something that he was not prepared for.  He made a mistake running in the way he did.  That doesn't mean he deserved to the pay the price he paid - no one deserves anything like that.  He was certainly the victim of something horrible.  But regardless of his intentions - and I assume that they were good and peaceful - he is not blameless in what happened\\" (page 252).<br />And on Washington's problematic quest for redemption, John Lucas observes, \\"You know what I wish?  I wish [Washington] could just say, `I'm sorry. I screwed up.' All the years, all I've heard over and over again is, `I'm sorry but...' Sometimes in life, you make a mistake and there's no buts and no explanations....There's no peace in `I'm sorry, but.' You can't find peace untilyou truly understand that the only thing to say is, `I'm sorry,' period\\" (pages 343-4).<br />Fascinating material, impressive reporting, but 300+ pages are not required to tell this story.	2003-04-02

I found the information in this book quite accurate, though a bit dated:  as of March 2003, a number of new roads have been paved, and, as the book correctly anticipates, a number of hotels etc. were constructed after the book's publication for the Africa's Cup soccer tournament, and, as a consequence, are not included in the descriptions.  The material on Pays Dogon is good, but far from comprehensive - some of the most interesting villages I visited were not even mentioned in the book.  Like other Bradt guides it shows a good cultural sensitivity to travel in very low income countries, for example providing some useful suggestions on how to constructively handle the frequent requests one gets from village children for candy or pens. (The claim in another review that the book encourages giving such gifts is a flat misrepresentation of the author.) So, the book is quite good though a bit dated - nothing that could not be addressed easily in a new edition.	2003-03-31

It began, apparently some years ago, as the author's dissertation.  As a consequence, most of the analysis and references apply to events in the past.  It is much better on Korea than it is on the Philippines. The book argues that the outcomes in the Philippines and Korea are best understood as a competition between the political and economic elite for the rents generated by the economy.  Since the competition between the political and economic elite was more balanced in Korea, corruption there did not spiral out of control as it did in the Philippines.  A chapter attempting to analyze these countries rather differing experiences in the 1997 Asian financial crisis (the Philippines fared better than Korea) in terms of this framework seems appended to any already finished product.  The book does make the important point that simply invoking the slogan \\"developmental state\\" is an inadequate explanation of these two countries differing histories.	2002-07-30

Despite its publication in 2001, none of the papers deal centrally with the Asian financial crisis. In several instances (Ito's overview, McKinnon on international monetary arrangement, Urata on FDI), authors simply go through the motions, rehashing their well-known positions on issues without adding any new insight. Woo on corporate governance is long on jargon and short on substance. The only paper that really presents new results is Lawrence and Weinstein on Japanese industrial policy, though Pack's dissection of the growth accounting debate as it relates to Asia is very informative. Some of the other papers (Okazaki on Japanese industrial policy, Perkins on corruption in China and Vietnam, Jomo on SE Asian capitalism) while not presenting new research per se, at least offer some interesting ideas.	2002-05-08

It basically gets the story of the North Korean famine right, but it is misleading or wrong in many of the specifics, starting with the first sentence of the book \\"In September 1995 the North Korean government, in a rare admission of vulnerability announced to the outside world that severe flooding had devastated its agricultural regions and that subsequent failure had caused widespread food shortages.\\"  Narrowly true, perhaps - the government of North Korea may well have made such a statement in September 1995 - but thoroughly misleading.  The government of North Korea had publicly admitted it had food shortages and successfully reached agreements with Japan and South Korea to supply emergency food aid in May 1995 - before the floods hit in June.  So unless time moves backwards on the Korean peninsula, floods in June could not be the cause of agreements reached in May.  As evidenced by the September statement that Natsios uses to begin the book, the flooding proved politically useful to both the North Koreans (the famine was an act of God and not a combination of their own incompetence and malevolence) and to the donor community (easier to supply aid in response to victims of natural disasters than victims of a thoroughly odious regime).<br />Much of this book is built on such half-truths.  In part, this is due to its author's intended or inadvertent tendency to place himself at the center of all events.  This gives the book a certain strength:  the first-hand accounts -- I visited this orphanage on this date and this is what I observed -- are compelling.  But either Natsios is disturbingly self-promoting or simply doesn't know what he is talking about.  Time and time again, he makes false claims that he was the first (or the only) participant to see or understand some aspect of the famine.  For example, in chapter 4 hemakes much of his June 1998 trip to the Chinese border region and interviews with North Koreans refugees there.  Not for another 150 pages does he mention in passing that his own colleague at the US Institute for Peace, Scott Snyder, had done the same border trip, interviewed the same refugees, and published a report on this a year earlier.  To cite another example, the following chapter argues that no one except Natsios and Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen understood that famines are economic phenomenon, and as a consequence everyone misread what was occurring in North Korea.  Problem is, two economists, Marcus Noland, a Korea specialist associated with the Institution for International Economics, and Sherman Robinson, an agricultural economist affiliated with the International Food Policy Research Institute, had read their Sen, understood the economic basis of famines, and had produced an economic analysis of the North Korean famine, similar to the one that Natsios lays out in this book, in 1998.  Indeed, as in the case of Snyder, Noland and Robinson's work is listed in the reference list - so Natsios clearly new of its existence - though oddly it is never mentioned in the text.  I could go on.  Individuals are misidentified, private informal emails are quoted as \\"trip reports\\" etc.<br />It is unfortunate that this book is so error-filled, since it is unlikely that another comprehensive account of the North Korean famine will be produced in the near future.  Moreover, Natsios has been appointed director of the US Agency for International Development, so his view on these issues counts.  But while he got the broad outlines of the story right, he is wrong on many specifics, and one should not regard this book as the final authority on the North Korean famine.	2002-03-24

But it is a lot better than the 1 star reviews would suggest, some apparently motivated by Sharma's unflattering portrayal of India.<br />Prospective readers should think of this as sort of low rent Naipaul:  a bleak landscape populated by characters unable to exert much control over either the historical forces that shape their environments, or even their own urges.  From a storytelling standpoint, Sharma has trouble bring the narrative to a conclusion, and the novel falters in its final quarter, but the ending, at least, rings true.	2002-03-24

The end result is sort of the novelistic equivalent of a made for TV movie.

Some of the information is outdated (several new regional airports have been constructed and roads paved since this edition was published) but presumably the forthcoming edition will bring the descriptive material up to speed.  What really makes this guide, though, (and why I think it is superior to the Lonely Planet guide)is the background material on Ethiopian history and culture.  Since it is for historical and cultural reasons (as opposed to say viewing wildlife) that many travellers will visit Ethiopia, this part of the book is a real strength, as is the chapter on intercultural interaction.  Reading this guide you get the sense of real human beings writing it, not some generic &quot;three stars for this castle and here is a good restaurant.&quot; Definitely recommended.	2002-01-27

Some (Frank Flatters on Thailand, for example) are informative, some less so.  None of the papers considers the financial crisis as a regional or systemic crisis -- instead the focus is on country by country analyses.  Oddly enough, none of the papers on Taiwan deal with its decision in the fall of 1997 to devalue its currency, the New Taiwan dollar, which arguably intensified the crisis, at least with respect to Hong Kong and South Korea.  One can find some interesting material in these essays, but one will have to look elsewhere for an in depth analysis of the Asian financial crisis, even with respect to Taiwan.	2001-12-08

It does so through the remarkable life of Nick Zapetti, a small-time American hood who found his niche in post-war Japan.  Whiting sometimes has to stretch to connect Zapetti with the various themes and events that he describes (Zapetti's links to the Lockheed bribery scandal that brought down a Japanese government are pretty tenuous, for example), but he manages both to describe institutions such as sokaiya (corporate extortionists) who are important to the workings of the Japanese economy, and give the reader a sense of daily life in modern Japan.  <br />The amazon.com website is replete with scholarly studies of Japanese politics and economics.  This book is an interesting and important companion piece to \\"serious\\" analyses of Japan and would be an excellent addition to undergraduate syllabi on modern Japan.	2001-12-04

This beautifully written memoir brings home some very unpleasant truths:  war can be fun and addicting (along with horrific and repulsive); the casual abandonment of social constraint can be fun and liberating; and after too much fun it is difficult to downshift into \\"normal\\" society (so self-medicate).  It is an extraordinarily passionate and personal book, and evokes equally intense reactions in its readers as the reviews attest.<br />It is not too hard to jump from Anthony Loyd's discomfited Englishman looking for his place in the world to the thousands of muhajideen wandering through the Balkans and Central Asia looking for theirs.  Post 9/11 we may be dealing with thousands of these war addicts for years to come.<br />The chapter on Chechnya, in which Loyd temporarily leaves the Balkans for the even higher dosage action in Grosny (in which the Russians reportedly hit the city with 30,000 shells in a single day) is the worth the price of the book alone.  It puts the far more modest US bombing campaign in Afghanistan into a certain perspective.<br />In the end, this book is so intense that it is difficult to write about it at all.  Read it and see for yourself.	2001-11-27
US	51095848	R3UJ9TRKZ7JJZ4	0684873745	77248244	Unguarded: My Forty Years Surviving in the NBA	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A classic (and classy) point guard	Along with John Wooden, who practically invented basketball, Lenny Wilkens is the only man to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach.  In one or both of these capacities he has competed against giants of the game from Bill Russell to Michael Jordan to today's superstars such as Allen Iverson.  He has experienced the evolution of the NBA from the shoestring operation it was in the 1950s to the global phenomenon that it is today.  Wilkens was a publicly prominent African-American during one of this country's most racially turbulent periods.  He has risen from childhood poverty to almost incomprehensible wealth. <br />It is not hard to see why Lenny Wilkens has been so successful as a point guard or coach.  In these memoirs he comes across as perceptive and self-effacing - just the qualities that one wants in a point guard or a coach.  No chair-thrower, he. And with veteran basketball writer Terry Pluto handling the prose the book is an easy read.  Yet herein lies the problem:  I would have been happy to read twice as much.  The book is weirdly uneven in its treatment of Wilkens' life both on an off the court.  One feels like there are huge things going on both in the NBA and in the world that pass by unnoticed or with only cursory mention.<br />Perhaps this is unfair:  afterall the subtitle of the book is  \\"My forty years of surviving in the NBA,\\" not \\"what it was like to be a public figure in turbulent times.\\"  Even the basketball aspects of the book have some of this unevenness, however.  To give one example:  Wilkens goes into a fair amount of detail describing his first contract negotiation (he received less than $15,000 and had to take a summer job) and a subsequent salary dispute later in his career.  Yet late in the book he mentions almost in passing that one of his coaching contracts was for millions.  What is it like to have one's income rise like that?  What does it do to your family and others around you?  <br />In the endthese are quibbles, I suppose.  The book is unguarded and revealing in certain aspects, but one gets the sense that the extreme self-discipline necessary to accomplish what Wilkens has also lends itself to a certain degree of self-censorship.  I have no reason to believe that Wilkens is anything other than the thoroughly decent man that he appears to be from this book, and if he chooses to emphasize some aspects of his life over others in his memoirs, well, that's his prerogative.  <br />As another reviewer mentioned, Lenny Wilkens does come across as an admirable role model in this book without being a goody two-shoes or a candidate for sainthood.  This book would make an excellent gift for young people interested in basketball or simply the life of one remarkable American individual.  It might also be a good antidote for fans who believe the key to winning basketball games is throwing chairs.	2001-11-25

It is the story of Shoko Asahara, nee Chizuo Matsumoto:  a fat, possibly blind, hardscrabble con artist who somehow transforms his scam of the moment, the Aum Association of Mountain Wizards, to Aum Supreme Truth, a cult of tens of thousands of adherents worldwide who gave away their life's savings, and apparently all capacity of independent thought or moral judgment to this unlikeliest of messiahs.<br />Murder, kidnapping, Nazi-like medical experimentation, drug taking, and sexual abuse follow.  In a moment verging on parody Asahara declares that the world is threatened by a conspiracy that includes the Jews, Bill Clinton, the Queen of England and Madonna.  Mr. Asahara, please meet Mr. LaRouche and Mr. Bin Laden.<br />This alone would be awful enough, but Asahara had truly global ambitions:  first to stage a coup d'etat in his native Japan, and then initiate an Armageddon that would destroy the world.  For these purposes he penetrated nearly every Japanese public institution including the army and the police and set about obtaining by hook or crook weapons of mass destruction:  chemicals, biological agents, nuclear weapons, and - I kid you not -- death rays.  <br />Asahara's scheme would culminate in Aum's poison gas attack on the Tokyo subway system that killed 14 and injured thousands more.  Asahara was eventually apprehended and as of October 2001 his trial continues to drag on.  Aum continues to exist in Japan, though with a much smaller membership, much smaller coffers, and one hopes a much smaller capacity for inflicting mayhem. <br />This book is disturbing on its own terms; it is particularly disturbing in light of the events of September 11:  Asahara succeeded to a frightening extent and he had huge disadvantages relative to what Al Qaeda must possess today.  Rather that working from an established religion and the resentments of potentially millions of adherents, Asahara had to invent theology on the fly and recruit his following from scratch.  Moreover he had to constantly fund raise to keep his group in operation:  he had no family wealth or network of contributors to fall back on.  Finally, and most importantly, while the Japanese police certainly come off as incompetent in this telling, Asahara had no state support, indeed had to constantly deal with legal harassment and threats.  It is truly frightening to think about how far he got given the obstacles he faced and how far someone equally charismatic and diabolical could go if dealt a better hand of cards.<br />The only reason I don't give this book 5 stars is that I didn't feel that it ever got into the heads of the Aum adherents.  But given how strange this story is, perhaps that is asking too much of any author.	2001-10-21

Paul Blustein has a background in economics and first-hand experience in Asia where the crises originated.  The book is well documented:  Blustein conducted hundreds of interviews (unlike his Washington Post colleague Woodward, he actually names his sources) and is familiar with the academic literature on the subject.  Indeed, this entertaining book does a marvelous job of explaining the substantive economic issues while at the same time conveying the very human disorder of crisis management as practiced during these episodes. It is less doctrinaire than Friedman's cheerleading for globalization in &quot;The Lexus and the Olive Tree&quot; and is far better informed on economic policy making than Woodward's &quot;Maestro.&quot;  (Simply compare Blustein's highly informative descriptions of the Korean and Long Term Capital Management crises with the complete hash of the same episodes that Woodward produced in &quot;Maestro.&quot;)  Highly recommended.	2001-10-10

Ed Lincoln examines the postwar Japanese economic model (an emphasis on indirect finance (banking) and a diminished role for shareholders in corporate governance; networks of affiliated firms (keiretsu); and government-led industrial policy) and the strains that globalization has placed on it.  He argues that although the system has become sclerotic, that it satisfies the needs of enough political stakeholders to impede the formation of any stable coalition for fundamental reform.  As a consequence, deregulation in Japan is often taken in half-steps, delivering far less than advertised by its proponents. Lincoln believes it is by no means certain that efforts underway will be sufficient to pull Japan out of its economic malaise.<br />From a US standpoint, Lincoln argues that a weak Japanese economy is fundamentally against US interests. Japanese economic weakness is likely to contribute to policy tensions with the US, and Lincoln recommends that the US government pursue a &quot;low-key&quot; agenda of encouraging reform.  <br />The book is well documented with many tables and charts and fascinating examples.	2001-10-02

Their starting point was Japan's strong postwar economic growth (exagerrated by Japan's asset price bubble of the late 1980s).  They uncritically ascribed this to Japan's unique economic institutions or &quot;the Japan model&quot; and then extrapolated forward. <br />The subtitle of the book &quot;why Japan is still on track to overtake the U.S. by the year 2000&quot; hints that by the time this book was published in 1995 that something was going wrong.  Indeed, by 1995, it was apparent to close watchers of the Japanese economy that something was seriously amiss, putting cheerleaders like author Eamonn Fingleton on the defensive.  This one was past its &quot;sell by&quot; date the day it was published.<br />The intervening years have not treated Japan or this book gently. Rather than overtaking the U.S., Japan's economic performance between 1990-2000 was the worst decanal performance exhibited by any industrial country in the postwar period.<br />This book provides only inadvertant insight into why things went right in Japan for an extended period of time and then began going horribly wrong beginning around 1990.	2001-09-17

Without giving away the plot, the narrative arc of the story follows the transformation of the recording industry from its music-loving visionary founders to the corporate bean counters who dominate it today. <br />This is not The Great American Novel, but it is an enjoyable read, which as Lou Reed correctly notes on the cover, it is, at times, &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; funny. Despite the wildness of some of the antics recounted in the story they have an undeniable ring of plausibility, suggesting to me, at least, that this indeed more of a roman a clef than some would allow.

Music journalism doesn't have to be people who can't write interviewing people who can't speak for people who can't read. This volume proves it.<br />Editor Peter Guralnick has selected 35 pieces that are highly varied in style, subject matter, and length. One of the great things about this volume is that if you find yourself reading an article that doesn't really grab you, just move on - the next one will. With such a strong set of essays it seems almost churlish to single out individual ones of praise. David Moodie and Maureen Callahan's piece from Spin on Woodstock III &quot;Don't Drink the Brown Water&quot; reads like a postcard from one of the outer rings of hell. Arthur Kempton's piece from NYRB &quot;The Lost Tycoons: The Fall of Black Empires&quot; is a thought-provoking analysis on the rise (and fall) of Motown and the Nation of Islam. The MOTORBOOTY editor's send up of historical reenactors is hysterical and David Hadju's rumination on Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn is beautiful. And, as another reviewer noted, Eddie Dean's essay on a fanatical 78 collector is worth the price of admission alone. (And just think: us locals got to read it for free in the Washington City Paper.) On a lighter note, where else but this volume can one learn that Buck Owens sometimes includes &quot;Play That Funky Music White Boy&quot; and &quot;The Macarena&quot; in his sets (Jonny Whiteside, &quot;Merle Haggard's Twin Oracles&quot;), or that Steve Earle has opened for George Jones, Bob Dylan, and The Replacements (Dave Hoekstra, &quot;Steve Earle&quot;). I even learned a word for a sexual practice with which I was unfamiliar in a piece on a drug-addled Canadian fiddler (Rebecca Mead, &quot;Sex, Drugs, and Fiddling&quot;).<br />This book is a real gem, and would make a great gift for anyone interested in music and/or writing.

A less complete portrait of Smith's inner life and interests off the court than the autobiography, but a more complete, and in many ways a more compelling, account of his public life as coach/power broker of what amounts to a multimillion dollar franchise. In this sense it is more entertaining than Smith's book -- a more open treatment of the recruiting process (including the ones that got away), the management of the Nike contract, the rivalry with Duke etc.<br />Like the Smith book, it at times gets bogged down in season by season recapitulations of win-loss records.  It also includes some material (such as a few paragraphs on the murder of Michael Jordan's father) which presumably are worth mentioning, but don't really fit into the thematic or narrative flow, and seem to be inserted in a kind of obligatory fashion.  But these are quibbles.  <br />Unfortunately, the book ends with Smith's retirement and the installation of his hand-picked successor, Bill Guthridge, and, as a consequence, misses the surely interesting story of Guthridge's resignation two years later, and Smith and Guthridge's apparent inability to again stage manage the selection of the next long-run leader of the Carolina men's basketball program.  Nevertheless an interesting and worthwhile read.	2001-05-20

Corbett is a good writer and manages to convey a series of themes:  the tenuous existence of women's basketball in the US in 1995 when the team was formed, the heterogenous backgrounds of the players and coaches, the incipient rivalry between two nascent professional leagues for the allegiances of the players, to name a few.  And Corbett is to be commended for managing to integrate this disparate material into a single narrative.  But in basketball terms she is a &quot;homer&quot; -- and one wonders whether the exclusive access that she was given, implicitly or explicitly, informs this relentlessly positive depiction of the team. That said, it is probably a very good book for teenagers of either gender interested in basketball.	2001-05-20

Alan Greenspan is an interesting figure of historical significance.  This book sheds little light on either subject.<br />The book is hampered by its episodic nature, and, apparently, limited range of sources.  Woodward tries to sustain a narrative based largely on the twin themes of Greenspan's ability as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to manipulate the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) which sets an important benchmark interest rate, and whether that instrument, the federal funds rate, is moved up or down.<br />The first theme is of questionable interest: the institutional structure of the Fed gives the chairman enormous power.  It is not at all clear than another chairman, with a different substantive agenda and a different personality, could have just as effectively dominated the institution.  Despite Woodward's efforts, it is not at all clear that Greenspan is a &quot;maestro&quot; - on the contrary, he comes across as a mildly unpleasant character who treats his colleagues shabbily.<br />As for the second theme, well, it doesn't exactly make for a page turner.<br />These flaws alone would not earn the book such a low rating.  The real problems are sloppy writing and factual inaccuracy.  To give one example: Woodward tells us that Greenspan was born in 1926.  After graduating from high school, he attended Julliard School of Music for two years and then dropped out to join a touring big band.  He then quit the band, went back to school, and graduated from NYU with a degree in economics in 1948 .  Woodward writes that Greenspan received a masters degree in economics from NYU in 1950 and then entered the Columbia Phd program but quit before completing his dissertation. In the 1970s, NYU then &quot;finally awarded&quot; him what amounted to an honorary doctorate<br />This description begs more questions than it answers.  How did Greenspanspend two years in a conservatory, tour with a band, and graduate with a degree in economics at the age of 22?  What about military service?  Greenspan would have been of prime draft age for the Second World War.  Did he get some kind of exemption?  If so, for what reason? And why would NYU &quot;finally award&quot; the doctorate if the work had been done at Columbia?<br />One might overlook these flaws (even in biography) but they carry on into the more substantive sections of the book.  To give another example: Woodward's chapter 12 description of the Korean financial crisis of 1997.  He argues that the US government wanted US bankers to rollover their loans to Korea; that the bankers would have been able to resist pressure from Bob Rubin and Larry Summers of the Treasury, but not from the Greenspan Fed; and that Greenspan stood back while the Treasury jawboned the bankers.  This account is deeply flawed.<br />The critical rollover meeting was convened on 22 December 1997 by New York Federal Reserve President Bill McDonough in his office and attended by the heads of JP Morgan, Chase Manhattan, Citibank, Bank of NY, Bank of America, and Bankers Trust.  McDonough convinced the six money center banks to rollover their Korean loans, and having whipped the US banks into line, he then successfully brought the Europeans and Japanese on board.  The 22 December meeting was arguably the turning point in the crisis.<br />So why no mention of it in Woodward's account?  Its hard to believe that the author is unaware of it.  One is tempted to surmise that he deliberately omitted it from the narrative to set-up his interpretation in the succeeding chapter of the next crisis Greenspan encountered - the near collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Credit Management.  Again, there is a financial crisis, and again, the head of the New York Fed uses his office to jawbone US financial institutions to act against their own narrow interests.  However, in Woodward's telling, this is an unprecedented event, and Greenspan stands (well, actually sits) shoulder to shoulder with McDonough in the face of hostile Congressional critics.  Why this portrayal of the Fed's action in the LTCM case as being unique?  Is it because that action was seen as stopping a threat to the US economy, while the earlier intervention merely saved Korea (and did not save Russia and Brazil which subsequently encountered similar problems)?<br />At root, the problem with this book is as a rather hagiographic biography, it simply does not address the broader, and to my mind, more interesting questions such as whether it is desirable to have monetary policy conducted by an institution with little democratic accountability steered by the &quot;pains in the stomach&quot; of its chairman?   <br />Perhaps this is unfair.  In the end, we don't expect journalists to be deep-thinkers.  But we do expect them to get their facts straight.  Inaccuracies and heavy reliance on unnamed sources (from the man who, in a prior work, gave us Nixon talking to the White House paintings) makes me deeply skeptical of the value of this book either as biography, as an examination of the Fed, or as an analysis of monetary policy.	2001-01-11

It apparently was derived from the author's Ph.d dissertation in sociology.  It suffers from common defects of contemporary academic study:  while there is the de riguer emphasis on methodology/modeling, facts are only loosely fitted to the theory. Despite the veneer of rigor, it is actually rather informal -- no real falsifiable hypotheses are developed -- just story-telling dressed up in inpenetrable jargon.<br />The story?  Japan and South Korea have something called a &quot;mafioso state&quot; -- not to be confused with the Mafia as we know it -- the book's title is misleading in this sense.  What exactly is a mafioso state?  Well, it apparently is a state that is innovative and engaged in a kind of non-cooperative game with private business.  This (somehow) gives rise rent-seeking (or more accurately the socialization of risk) and the development of diversified conglomerates such as the chaebol in South Korea and keiretsu in Japan.  Of course, there are plenty of governments in the world which could be described in the same terms, but have not given rise to similar corporate forms, but the author justifies their exclusion by disparaging the usefulness of cross-cultural comparisons and arguing that comparison should be restricted to the &quot;East Asian Confucian culture zone.&quot;  A chapter on the financial crisis attempts to evaluate the crisis through this particular organizational lens.	2000-12-19

At some point John studied medicine (came in helpful the night he had to deliver his nephew), but gave it up to be a musician/recording engineer/and eventually professor of music and the University of Ghana (he also had a bit part in Fela's attempted movie, but that's another story).  He still lives at Bokor House outside Accra, and still plays in a band.<br />Anyway, between being a working musician, a recording engineer, and an archivist, he met/interviewed/worked with virtually everybody who was anybody in West African popular music from early highlife bandleaders like E.T. Mensah to the late Fela Kuti.<br />The book consists largely of short chapters about individual performers, grouped roughly according to chronology and geography.  From this organization, one gets a sense of thematic developments and forces in the musicians' lives, but much of the material is anecdotal, letting the performers speak for themselves.  And what anecdotes they are.  The chapter on Fela alone is worth the price of the book, though to hear John relate it, he didn't tell half of the story.	2000-11-08

The 16th century arrival of European powers on the West African coast opened up vast new trading opportunities. The Europeans tried to push inland to locate the source of the gold, while the Ashantis tried to subjugate the coastal dwelling Fantes who intermediated the trade between the seafaring Europeans and the Ashanti and other inland groups.<br />This book describes the 100 years on-again off-again war between the British (and their Fante allies) and the Ashanti (supported by the Dutch).  The author is an anthropologist and his intepretation of events emphasizes the cross-cultural incomprehension of two societies (Victorian Britain, and late Ashanti Empire) which in some ways were remarkably similar:  aristocratic, hierarchical, chauvinistic, imperialistic, militaristic.  Some of the stories are fascinating as in the depressing case of the British kidnapping and torture of an Ashanti peace emissary which predictably leads to Ashanti mobilization and the seige of the British castle at Cape Coast. Or the fact that it takes 70 years for the British to figure out that desertions by the Fante were less motivated by cowardice than the fact that the British were forcing their Fante porters to do culturally innappropriate &quot;women's work.&quot; Nevertheless, the author clearly likes both the British and the Ashanti, so he makes constant references to the &quot;cowardly&quot; &quot;perfidious&quot; etc. Fante.  What the Ashanti could not do, malaria and dysentary did (they don't call West Africa &quot;White Man's Grave&quot; for nothing) and in the end, the British need howitzers and Yoruba troops brought in from Nigeria to capture the Ashanti capital of Kumasi.  The final armed resistance to the British is led by an old woman named Yaa Asantewaa who after her capture died in exile in the Seychelles.<br />The Ashantis never really made their peace with the British and this history has relevance for contemporary Ghana as manifested by the underrepresentation of the Ashanti in the politically influential armed forces, relative to other ethnic groups.	2000-11-08

I have never been to Sierra Leone and cannot speak to the issue of whether Dooling's depiction of the Mende is accurate or not.

This memoir is consistent with what I have observed of Smith over the years:  intelligent, organized, interested in the world outside of basketball, publicly reserved, and loyal to a fault.  The last two characteristics make the book a little frustrating to read:  Smith will not name names or criticize his former players or coaches, though if you are fan of Carolina basketball you will know the names to fill into the anecdotes and incidents he describes (e.g. J.R. Reid's suspension from the 1989 ACC tournament semifinal for missing curfew.)

I had always meant to read this book.  I even knew of Malan's record reviewing under the name Nelson Mandela.  While vacationing in Southern Africa a few years ago with my (black) African wife, I ran out of reading material so I picked up &quot;My Traitor's Heart&quot; while browsing in a bookstore in Cape Town. A couple days later after a day of sightseeing, we returned to our hotel room and I lay down on the bed and began reading the book.  It was an eery feeling to realize that, unknowingly, earlier that day we had visited the very farm where the transgressive act had taken place that sets the whole Malan family saga into motion.  The book became a kind of companion for the rest of our stay in South Africa.<br />Much of the literature produced during the apartheid period now seems dated. This book does not.
