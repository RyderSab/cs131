Unfortunately, the end of _Locked Doors_ seems to suggest that there will be yet a third volume in the ongoing saga of poor Andrew Thomas, a well-known and popular writer whose life was destroyed when he was framed for a series of killings in _Desert Places_, Crouch's first novel and an admittedly harrowing one. I say \\"unfortunately\\" because _Locked Doors_ simply cannot live up to the promise of that first novel and grows ever more preposterous the longer it goes on. _Desert Places_ was suitably horrific and realistic and was a real page-turner. _Locked Doors_ is not, however. The characters are one-dimensional and cartoonish. After a certain point, it becomes obvious that not a single character you might care about is going to come out of this one all right. And when the Kite family--psychopaths who slay together stay together--wipe out everyone on a ferry voyage to try to get their hands on an escaping Thomas, the book finally goes over the top into full-blown nonsense. Crouch has a gift for suspense, but he really needs to try another story and let these poor people get on with whatever lives they have left. Very disappointing novel--beware of all the positive reviews here!	2005-08-22

The two-man PSIT team, responsible for psychological and sociological crimes, are called to the scene when a series of bodies start showing up in weird circumstances, each with a tiny piece of weirdly compelling art left nearby. It gradually becomes apparent that the dead were all at one time followers of Marsden Hexcamp, a Charles Manson-like sociopath and self-proclaimed artist who was killed by one of his female acolytes 30 years before. The art angle draws Carson into the realm of \\"the death collectors,\\" usually wealthy individuals who can afford the ever-spiralling prices commanded by items associated with serial killers and other famous criminals. There's a rumor that Hexcamp left behind an undiscovered treasure trove of paintings that, if they exist, would be worth a fortune, and the deaths seem to be somehow connected.<br /><br />Kerley does a great job drawing his locations. Mobile is an unusual setting for a mystery series, but a memorable one. Carson and Harry are memorable characters, too, and play off each other with the right degree of camaraderie and biting remarks. Carson's serial killer brother, Jeremy, who made a contribution to the investigation in _The Hundredth Man_, is on-hand again to provide valuable insights. And Carson has a new love interest in the person of a persistent television reporter who manages to worm her way into the investigation. This was a very fast, fun, enjoyable read and I'm very much looking forward to the next book in this series. Mr. Kerley is a real talent!	2005-08-22

The carpet makers are members of a rigid, strictly-controlled society wherein each man spends his life weaving an intricately structured carpet made solely from the hair of his wives and female children. Upon his death, the carpet goes to his son, who sells it and begins work on his own carpet. The whole thing is so carefully and intricately laid out, that the more detail we get about the larger society, the more heartbreaking the whole thing becomes. Don't read too many of the reviews/descriptions, because you don't want to know too much of the plot beforehand. As the stories gradually move farther and farther away from the simple planet/society of the carpet makers to the seat of power of the galactic empire, the book becomes more and more powerful and is a truly compelling look at abuse of power and the difficulty of overturning the social order, no matter how flawed or outdated it has become. Though translated from German, the book is never stilted or strange. The story flows beautifully and was one that I could not put down until I was finished. Hopefully, we'll see more of Mr. Eschbach's work translated for English-speaking audiences.	2005-08-17

As others have mentioned, though, there are lots of unresolved plot lines, such as what exactly was going on behind the scenes most of the time. _Ilium_ really set up some expectations that any writer would feel hard-pressed to follow through on and I think Simmons did his best, though it's all rather disappointing and a bit unclear at the end. It's great fun to watch the Iliad unravel and the storyline go off in unexpected directions, with characters like Agamemnon and Menelaus getting their just deserts, not to mention Achilles' role as hen-pecked husband. You really should read _Ilium_ first, or you'll be completely lost, and while it helps to know something about the Iliad, you're probably going to get most of what you need to know from a quick viewing of the recent Brad Pitt film, _Troy_, to be able to follow things and appreciate how the Trojan war goes awry. It's great to see Hector, probably the only true hero by today's standards, alive and well and coming into his own as the successor to his father, King Priam. His death and the desecration of his body are a truly horrific moment in the Iliad, since he is the only character acting out of a sense of personal honor and trying to protect his family. Everyone else is out for personal glory and as many spoils as they can haul away. Anyway, loose ends and all, I would still strongly recommend this book to any fan of literate science fiction.	2005-08-02
US	52969730	R292AWYNLUPC9J	0375405380	198582056	The Power of the Dog	Books	5	103	106	N	N	Excellent capsule history of the failed war on drugs	Don Winslow's latest book (after _California Fire and Life_), _The Power of the Dog_, is an epic look at the US war on drugs from its earliest beginnings to more recent times.  The book is violent and thrilling and heart-breaking, as it follows a large cast of characters from the early 1970s through 2004, showing how the competing interests and agendas of various government agencies (the CIA, the DEA, etc.) get in the way of successfully combatting the problem, and often only served to make things much worse.<br /><br />Art Keller, the book's protagonist, is a half-Hispanic DEA agent who grew up in the San Diego barrio and saw the effects of drugs on his friends and family firsthand.  As a rookie agent, he makes the mistake of befriending Don Miguel Angel Barrera, one of the top Mexican policemen, in an effort to topple the reigning drug kingpin.  Barrera proceeds to move into the subsequent power vacuum and sets up La Federaccion, a much more well-organized and deadly organization than previously existed, and run by his two nephews, the intelligent and sensitive Adan, and the flashy and violent Raul.<br /><br />This sets in motion a 30-year vendetta on Keller's part, as he attempts to take down the Barreras and atone for his mistake, a vendetta that will lead to the deaths of numerous innocent parties along the way, and to Keller's estrangement from his own wife and children.<br /><br />The book was a very fast-moving, though extremely violent novel.  In a little over 500 pages, Winslow does an amazing job of encapsulating a lot of recent history, including the Camarena murder, the Iran-Contra scandal, and other related events, into a very readable and entertaining novel, one of the best I've read recently.  If you're not too squeamish, I'd highly recommend the book.	2005-06-06
US	52969730	R3U8PR8PX8BKFF	0425197077	73763879	Dark Woods	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Very Smart and Well-Written	I came to the book expecting more of a horror novel, based on the cover art and the jacket blurbs/description.  What I got instead was a book that takes the bigfoot/sasquatch legend seriously, assuming that such creatures must exist, given all the evidence which has accumulated over time, as well as an ongoing argument about the effect of the Endangered Species Act, should it ever be proven that such a creature does in fact exist.  There are powerful forces out there whose interests would not be served by such proof.  Even though the focus isn't so much on the horror, this is still a fast-moving and scary book, which is very atmospheric, with great descriptions of the settings and locales.  Although the book does at times threaten to become more of a lecture (hunting is good, the government is bad), it is still a very entertaining and thought-provoking novel, and a real page-turner, too.	2005-05-24

Now, he does the occasional \\"favor\\" for his friends and otherwise takes it pretty easy.  At the start of _Tin City_, Mac gets a call from Mr. Mosley, an old friend of his father's, who is a beekeeper and wants Mac's help figuring out why an unusually large number of his bees have been dying off lately.  Mac calls in a favor from a friend in the entomology department at the University of Minnesota and it's not too long before the friend's graduate teaching assistant has tracked down the source of a pesticide being sprayed on a neighboring property, which is drifting over to Mosley's hives and killing his bees.  When the teaching assistant calls in and reports being shot at, Mac and Mosley hurriedly drive to the scene to offer their assistance.  At the scene, they're confonted by a man holding a shotgun and telling them they're trespassing.  They leave, only to involve one of Mac's other friends, a lawyer, by having him send a threatening letter to the property's owner.  From there, events suddenly turn violent--Mosley is killed and the lawyer's wife is assaulted, leaving Mac a very angry man who must get to the bottom of things and track down the man responsible.<br /><br />This was an excellent book, with its settings and locations around the Twin Cities brought to convincing life.  Much of the story takes place in a tiny municipality called Hilltop, the \\"tin city\\" of the title, which is an actual place, a city of mobile homes completely surrounded by the larger city of Columbia Heights.  Mac pretends to be a writer for _Trailer Life_ magazine and interviews several of the residents, allowing Housewright to include some fascinating historical details about this real place (I checked my Twin Cities street atlas just to make sure, and sure enough, there is a Hilltop, right where Housewright says it is).  Along the way, Mac falls in love with Penelope Glass, a song writer and the neglected wife of a rogue FBI agent.  The scenes describing their conversations and a dinner they have together have a real sweetness to them.  Mac finds himself in the middle of a complicated mess, involving a mobster on the run from a botched assassination attempt in New York and a couple of local gangster wanna-be's, and things are complicated further when the FBI agent places a locate and detain order for him, requiring Mac to go underground.<br /><br />Mac's an appealing character, with lots of friends in high and low places.  His loyalty to his friends and willingness to do what it takes to make things right, as well as his thoughts on his deceased father and the hand Mr. Mosley had in bringing him up to be a \\"good guy,\\" and the uncertainty he feels when he gets some measure of vengeance, make him a pretty complicated character.  _Tin City_ is an excellent follow-up to the very strong _A Hard Ticket Home_ and, hopefully, there will be many more \\"Mac\\" McKenzie novels to follow.

When the job brings him in contact with some of his old friends and acquaintances, the stage is set for a struggle between doing right thing and doing the honorable thing.  Should he try to avenge the shooting of his parole officer, Rachel Lopez, a woman he's come to see as a friend, especially since he knows more about the circumstances than the police?  Lorenzo's old friend and running partner, Nigel Johnson, is now the head of one drugs operation and dealing with problems of his own--a young man he was grooming for greater responsibility in the organization has just been killed in a senseless confrontation with members of a rival gang--but he still has time to worry about Lorenzo and seeing to it that he sticks to the straight and narrow.<br /><br />This is a shorter novel than some of Pelecanos' recent books, but no less satisfying for that.  The moral issues are still as sticky and there are moments of great despair, as well as triumph (there's a running thread of Narcotics Anonymous meetings in the novel that provide many of these moments).  Lorenzo is an easy character to like and his heartfelt concern for the mistreated dogs he continually deals with in his day-to-day life is admirable.  He makes some small steps toward trying to get involved in his daughter's life--she doesn't know him, since he's been away in prison all her life--and he also makes the first steps toward romancing a young single mother and her daughter.  We're also treated to glimpses of Rachel Lopez's life, marked by an honest level of concern for her parolees when she's on the job, and careless sex and alcohol use when she's off the clock.<br /><br />I think Pelecanos' work as a writer for _The Wire_ shows up here in the novel, which seems more economical in the way it deals with the drug problem and how it affects people of varying stripes and from different walks of life.  There are fewer musical allusions, too, though they're still present, but as less of a marker of characters' level of hipness.

From villainous Leland Howard, to deputy sheriff Bobby Gambier and his mute brother Alex, to Mally Shaw and her father, Dr. Ramses Valjean, these are some of the more memorable and three-dimensional characters I've encountered lately.  In the hands of the right person, this could make a great movie, with a very meaty role in Dr. Valjean and his forensics expertise.  The story is a mixture of mystery and the supernatural and is handled with great expertise.  It's nice to see Mr. Farris taking a break from the all-out horror pyrotechnics of his Fury sequels and turning his great talent to a quieter, though no less masterly tale.

It's hard to believe the author is so young, but on the other hand, the book, which does attempt to hit all the right notes for a detective novel, never once felt true or authentic.  Lincoln Perry and Joe Pritchard are a pair of ex-cops who've gone into business together as PIs in Cleveland, Ohio.  They are hired by John Weston, the father of another local detective, Wayne Weston, who was recently found dead, apparently a suicide.  Wayne's wife and daughter are missing and John wants them found, and he wants to know what happened to his son, who he doesn't think was capable of suicide.  The case escalates from there to involve the local Russian mafia, as well as a real estate bigwig (\\"Cleveland's answer to Donald Trump\\").<br /><br />It's hard to talk about the book without spoilers, but suffice it to say that the interactions between characters never ring true. ***SPOILER****When Lincoln does find the missing wife and daughter, he grows very attached to them and the wife throws herself at him.  The sequence reads more like Koryta is thinking \\"in a good detective novel, this is what should happen\\" than as a truly believable plot development.  There isn't any chemistry between Lincoln and the woman.  Plus, we've been lead to believe that his true romantic interest lies in newspaperwoman Amy Ambrose, so there's an added element of unbelievability in these sequences.  This is just one example, but I continually felt when reading that Koryta was just putting his characters through their paces without really bringing them fully to life.<br /><br />Certainly, a comparison of this book to Andrew Klavan's Bishop/ Weiss books, which also feature a two-man detective agency, albeit with much more believable, even if occasionally over-the-top characters, leaves Koryta looking a bit lightweight.  If _Tonight I Said Goodbye_ is the start of a series, I hope further books are harder-edged and more believable.dged and more believable.	2005-02-28

And McKinty sure likes his femmes fatale.  His protagonist, Alex Lawson, is a former policeman in the Ulster Royal Constabulary in Northern Ireland.  Lawson stumbled onto some things he'd have been better off not knowing while working undercover in the drugs squad and shortly thereafter, he was fired, having been caught stealing heroin from the evidence room.  Now, he's struggling to get by and raise the cash for his next fix, when a couple of things happen.  First, a policeman from Scotland Yard, part of an inquiry into corruption in the Irish force, pays him a visit and isn't satisfied with Alex's claims that he knows nothing.  Second, Alex receives the news that a former girlfriend of his has been killed in Denver, Colorado, where she was working for a non-profit environmental group.  When the girl's father hires him to look into his daughter's death, Alex is able to get out of town for awhile, one step ahead of both the British inquiry and the corrupt cops who'd like to silence him.<br /><br />McKinty does a great job of describing Denver and its environs (the book jacket indicates he lives there now, having relocated from Northern Ireland).  Alex goes undercover, working for the environmental group as a fundraiser, and is trucked to various neighborhoods around town to go door-to-door, and the descriptions of these neighborhoods never rings false.  Plus, Alex and a friend who came along to America with him find lodgings in a run-down building on notorious Colfax Avenue, a place where it isn't that difficult for Alex to find his next fix.<br /><br />The book does a good job of charting his downward spiral and his self-justifications that he's not really an addict.  It becomes clear to him that someone in the non-profit must have discovered that his old girlfriend had stumbled upon accounting irregularities and that that's why she was killed.  The group is the baby of a rich young man with political aspirations and either he or his brother or his beautiful wife knows more than they're letting on.<br /><br />This was a good follow-up to _Dead I Well May Be_, and though it covers similar bleak noir territory, it never gets quite so gritty or hopeless as that previous novel, though Alex's heroin addiction does threaten to drag him down.  He makes several poor choices that result in a number of additional deaths and we (and he) have to wonder if he wouldn't have been a bit sharper without the drugs.  But ultimately, the book holds out some hope for his redemption and ends on a hopeful note.  McKinty is a great talent and I'll be looking forward to wherever he decides to take me next.aby of a rich young man with political aspirations and either he or his brother or his beautiful wife knows more than they're letting on. <br /> <br />This was a good follow-up to _Dead I Well May Be_, and though it covers similar bleak noir territory, it never gets quite so gritty or hopeless as that previous novel, though Alex's heroin addiction does threaten to drag him down.

I really wanted to like this book, after reading all the great reviews here and then taking the time to track down a copy. But, sorry to say, this just isn't very good. Sure, there are moments and scenes of great originality, but on the whole, Martindale's book just doesn't live up to the hype. The characters aren't particularly original, especially the rotten old man who gets everyone in trouble to begin with, inviting them on a \\"fishing trip\\" that quickly gets re-routed and becomes a survival test. When a character is already halfway crazy to begin with, it's hard to feel anything when he goes over the edge completely. Also, I'm not a big fan of horror novels where the horror happens off-stage. Some of the most horrific happenings in this novel happen away from our perspective as readers of the novel and we're left to read the aftermath and try to fill in the blanks and imagine what happened. And then there were the multiple endings--come on, just pick one and stick with it, for crying out loud. The book could easily have ended 50-80 pages sooner. I'm disappointed that I spent as much as I did for a used copy of this book. You might want to look for it on eBay.	2005-01-24

In fact, there is ultimately very little by way of horror in the book. It's more of a technothriller regarding the end of the world. If you're looking for a madcap, apocalyptic adventure, that's more what you'll be getting. There's an awful lot of submarine lore, ala Tom Clancy, in this book, which makes me wonder just a bit about the author, Walter Greatshell. He either has a background in naval warfare or he did an awful lot of research into  the topic and couldn't bear to leave anything out. There is just so much weird stuff, from the Pakistani Beatles cover band struggling to survive on the wreck of a luxury cruiseliner stuck in the ice, to the power struggles between the super-rich and the remnants of the U.S. Air Force at one of the last bastions of civilization, a military base in Greenland, it's hard to imagine a publisher giving this book the go-ahead. It was, surprisingly, quite well-written and almost tongue-in-cheek at times, but this certainly isn't the all-out horror novel its packaging would lead you to believe.	2005-01-21

But Klavan writes with such power and assuredness, that the whole thing comes to vivid life and it moves.<br /><br />Jim Bishop is charged with bringing back the daughter of a rich man who is planning a senate run.  In an act of rebellion, she's joined a biker gang made up of misfits and castoffs too crazy to be accepted in the traditional gangs (there's even a \\"Mad Dog\\"; at one point, a character says \\"What does a biker have to do to earn the nickname Mad Dog?\\").  They're the Outriders and they're not above killing a few innocent bystanders who might get in the way of their smash-and- grab thefts.<br /><br />Back at the office, Weiss has been hired by a feminist professor to track down the person responsible for a string of sexually-harassing emails.  The only problem is she's been receiving them for over nine months--it turns out she's fallen in love with the sender and wants help tracking him down.  The process of finding out who the sender is allows Weiss some time to reflect on his own unrequited love for his fantasy woman from the previous<br />novel.  He knows that there's an unstoppable killer out there, just waiting to follow him should he try to find this woman, but he's not sure if that should stop him from trying.<br /><br />There's a great scene where the unnamed \\"I\\" narrator (if we believe the book's foreword, this is Klavan himself, though it's hard to believe these books are really based on real events as the narrator assures us) meets a woman who seems to be his perfect match and they have a wonderful conversation which ends with her giving him her phone number and eliciting a promise for him to call.  Very soon after, he drifts into an all-consuming sexual relationship with Weiss' female operative Sissy, and forgets all about Emma McNair, his perfect woman.  Very sad, really.<br /><br />We learn more about the backstory of the relationship between Bishop and Weiss and how they started working together.  It all builds to a raid on a warehouse during a dark and stormy night, with police and FBI agents, tipped off by Bishop, waiting to capture the gang.<br /><br />I really had a great time with this book and it was literally a page-turner that wouldn't let me go.  There were several times that I was about to put the book aside and do something else, but I read just one more sentence and that was enough to draw me into the next chapter and then the next.

US	52969730	R2HV99RB27CFNP	0743435087	835439981	Dying Inside	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Classic novel about telepathy	Not sure what else I can add that others haven't mentioned in their reviews, but I just wanted to be sure another 5-star review was out there. This is an amazing, sad book, just one of a whole series of thought-provoking novels Silverberg was turning out one after another in an amazing burst of creativity during the late 60s and early 70s. I was struck by the squalor and pettiness of Silverberg's narrator. I can't think of a much more lowly way to make a living than churning out term papers for college students. And this is a man who can read minds! He hasn't taken this gift and used it for any real purpose, whether for the good of mankind or to make a couple of bucks in Las Vegas. And now that the power is deserting him, he hasn't really learned anything from his past mistakes or come to grips with how he's alienated those around him. A great sci-fi parable of lost/squandered potential that anyone can identify with.	2004-11-05
US	52969730	R125ZGDUGDN5VT	052594821X	89678523	The Hundredth Man	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Very Strong, Memorable Debut Novel	My most recent read is _The Hundredth Man_ by Jack Kerley. This was a very strong first novel by a former ad man. It is a police procedural set in Mobile, Alabama, and follows young Carson Ryder and his more seasoned partner Harry Nautilus as they attempt to figure out who is killing and decapitating a series of men who could almost be mirror images of each other, body-wise. Based on his success some years previously in capturing another serial killer, Carson and Harry have been assigned to a new task force, PSIT, which investigates psychologically abnormal crimes.<br /><br />Carson has his own ace in the hole, a psychotic, serial killer brother whose advice proved invaluable in the earlier case and who he goes to again for help this time. That he has to submit to letting his brother burn his arm with a lighter seems a small price to pay. Plus, Carson is falling for a new doctor in the coroner's office, Ava Davenelle, who is exhibiting all the signs of being an alcoholic. Throw in some police department politics and wrangling for position and you've got a very memorable, very assured first novel. And the Mobile setting is well developed and unusual, too.<br /><br />Hopefully we'll be seeing more books by Mr. Kerley in the future. Recommended.	2004-10-22

I was moderately amused by _Fat White Vampire Blues_; enough so to give Andrew Fox's sequel a try. Am I glad I did. Jules really comes into his own as a character this time around, as he sets out to investigate who or what is mutilating some of the \\"youngsters\\" of the High Krewe of Vlad Tepes, as well as killing several black ministers. All the characters from the first book are back--Doodlebug, Jules' transgendered vampire progeny, Maureen, Jules' vampire/stripper girlfriend, and the black vampires who gave him so much trouble in the first book, but who show signs of developing mutual respect and admiration for Jules this time around. I was touched by the developing friendship between Jules and Preston, one of the black vampires who were out to get Jules and his friends the last time around. There is a surprising depth to the story, too, as it talks about redevelopment of aging neighborhoods and at what price such development can or should come. There's an easy, laid-back vibe to things, too, in keeping with the New Orleans setting. All in all, this is a much more cohesive book than _Fat White Vampire Blues_ which often read like a series of vignettes or unrelated scenes that weren't always tied together very coherently. This one has a strong plot and very vivid, well-realized characters and I really enjoyed reading it. I would certainly be willing to read the future adventures of Jules Duchon and co.	2004-10-14

This is his second John Ray Horn novel, following the adventures of a former movie cowboy who now works as a debt collector for his Indian sidekick from the movies, and occasionally finds himself investigating a variety of crimes. There are some dark corners in these novels, but, unfortunately, not enough of them. I really want to like Horn, but Wright is still something of a clunky writer--Horn is not a very consistent character. He's always jumping to the wrong conclusions and alienating fomer friends, who are all too willing to forgive him his mistakes. Wright tries to palm this off as the product of Horn's upbringing by a morally rigid preacher-father, but it reads more like inconsistent characterization. Horn is also just a bit too much of a goody-goody, in keeping with his fomer movie cowboy role, to deal with the sorts of dark crimes he keeps coming up against (here, it's a long-forgotten rape/murder at a wild party back in the silent movie days which turns out to have repercussions in the present day, post WWII Los Angeles). If these books were more like _Chinatown_ in their handling of the dark side of America's fascination with California, they might be more compelling. It wasn't a bad book by any means, but I'm still waiting for Wright to really hit one out of the park.	2004-10-04

I'm<br />not sure why I never read the first, but I will have<br />to go back and correct that mistake.  Wow! _Cold Blood_<br />was a great book.<br />A bridesmaid has disappeared while walking home from the<br />reception in Moose Lake, Minnesota.  A few days later,<br />during a search of the area, Justice Trip, a traveling<br />salesman who has volunteered to help, stumbles across<br />a finger, which proves to be that of the missing woman.<br />He briefly becomes a minor celebrity when it is discovered<br />he's had similar luck before, finding the necklace of a<br />missing girl in a rural area of Wisconsin, just before the<br />girl herself was discovered, alive and well.  This time,<br />things don't look as hopeful for the missing woman.<br />Paris Murphy, a homicide detective in St. Paul, sees the<br />news coverage and recognizes Trip as a high school classmate,<br />one who'd been picked on and mistreated in high school and<br />someone who'd once asked her to a homecoming dance.  She still<br />feels bad that her old boyfriend and some of his friends had<br />beaten Trip up as a result.  Since there's a St. Paul link to<br />the disappearance--the woman's estranged husband lives nearby--<br />Murphy becomes involved in the case and can't shake her suspicion<br />that Trip might know more about what happened than he's letting<br />on.<br />Monsour does a great job of capturing the Minnesota locations<br />and just a general feel for the people and the atmosphere of both<br />small town and big city Minnesota.  Murphy is a great character,<br />the daughter of a Lebanese mother and an Irish father, and one of<br />a large group of children.  She has her own personal problems--her<br />relationship with her separated husband doesn't seem to be improving,<br />no matter what she tries, and the man she's had an affair with recently<br />is pushing her too hard to make their relationship something more.<br />And she can't help but feel some sort of attraction to her boss in<br />homicide, a former undercover cop who is something of a legend in the<br />department.<br />Monsour also does a nice job with the villain in the book.  We almost,<br />not quite, but almost, feel sorry for him.  He's someone we can sympathize<br />with, though the reasons for his actions escape explanation, even at the<br />end.  There are some gruesome passages in the book, so if you aren't up<br />to some blood and gore in your mysteries, you might want to skip this<br />one, but all in all, I was very pleasantly surprised.  I'm going to check<br />out _Clean Cut_, the first novel in this series, right away.can't help but feel some sort of attraction to her boss in<BR>homicide, a former undercover cop who is something of a legend in the<BR>department.<br />Monsour also does a nice job with the villain in the book.

Set largely in a fictional Boston neighborhood,<br />it nevertheless reminded me a lot of Dennis Lehane's PI books.<br />Landay is a former DA from Boston, so I guess he has the background<br />to make things ring true.<br />The book follows police chief Ben Truman, of Versailles (pronounced<br />&quot;Ver-Sayles&quot;), Maine, as he becomes involved in the investigation of<br />the murder of a Boston DA in a local lakefront cabin.  Ben had been<br />a promising graduate student in history when he left school to come<br />back home and help care for his mother, whose Alzheimer's has been<br />getting worse.  Ben's dad, Claude, is the former police chief and<br />Ben takes a job with the department to give himself something to do.<br />Given his family, he is quickly made chief, one of the youngest in<br />the country, and has a fairly liberal attitude to the dispensation<br />of law and order.  He certainly isn't ready for a homicide investigation<br />and the other investigators are fairly condescending to him.  For some<br />reason, though, he feels a need to stay involved and, with the help of<br />a retired Boston police detective, John Kelly, he is tutored in the<br />workings of a real investigation.<br />Evidence seems to point to a drug dealer, Harold Braxton, who has been<br />on the radar screens of detectives in the Mission Flats area for many<br />years, but who has managed to avoid having any charges stick to him.<br />About 10 years earlier, Braxton was the main suspect in the shooting death<br />of a Boston policeman during a drug raid, but a complicated series of<br />incidents lead to the case being dismissed.  Now, once again, Braxton is<br />one of the main suspects in the killing of Bob Danziger, the DA, who might<br />have been digging into the earlier crime, intending to re-open the investigation.<br />This was a great, compelling story, with a lot of insider information on how<br />the police work, particularly in setting up controlled buys, and so forth.<br />We are schooled in the workings of a major investigation, as well as the<br />political issues that run a case, along with Ben, who is deceptively naive.<br />Ben has several secrets of his own that come out in the course of the<br />investigation and prove to be potential bombshells.  The ending, in particular,<br />is quite a surprise and requires us to completely revise our understanding of<br />Ben.  He's a complicated character and, ultimately, not particularly likeable.<br />I don't think this will be the first in a series of Ben Truman mysteries.<br />Still, Landay is a great writer and this is a memorable first novel.  If you<br />like Lehane's Kenzie/Gennaro series, you'll probably like this, too.

Usually, this is the sort of book that's right up my alley, but this was ultimately rather silly.<br /><br />Basically, \\"The Arcanum\\" of the title is a group of occult watchdogs who get together to battle mystical conspiracies.  The group consists of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, H. P. Lovecraft, Harry Houdini, and Marie Laveau, \\"the voodoo queen of New Orleans.\\"<br /><br />I think one of the big reasons this book just didn't work for me was because there was no real sense of these people as historic personages--they were just characters in a book.  Wheeler never brings them to convincing life.  They could have been anyone.<br /><br />Essentially, the book follows the course of events when The Book of Enoch, a third testament of the Bible which contains \\"God's mistakes,\\" is stolen from the British Museum.  In the course of the theft, the founder of the Arcanum, Konstantin DuVall, counselor to presidents and czars, is murdered.  Doyle gets involved in investigating DuVall's death and based on his dying words, \\"he's in my mind,\\" begins to suspect that the apparent accidental death was more than that.  He gets in touch with his old friend, Houdini, who has put the Arcanum behind him and is reluctant to get involved.  Laveau is conveniently visiting New York City and has her henchmen abduct Doyle.  And Lovecraft, who no one really trusts and is presented as little more than an adolescent nerd/pervert, is also called in.  Street people are being violently murdered and the deaths seem to tie in with the \\"lost tribe of Enoch,\\" who just may be exiled angels in human guise.<br /><br />There are a lot of action set-pieces, which would seem to suggest the story might have originated as a failed screenplay, and indeed, the author notes indicate Wheeler has worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood.  Ultimately, though, the whole thing just never really worked for me and it was a real chore to keep reading all the way to the end.  I usually like books like this, such as Mark Frost's _The List of 7_, or William Hjortsberg's _Nevermore_, or most of Tim Powers' output, but Wheeler just wasn't very adept at breathing life into his historical characters.  Count this as a major disappointment.y to the end.

I'm so glad I discovered these books and gave them a try.  If you haven't read these yet, you've got some pleasant reading waiting for you.<br />Choice is a great character, easy to identify with.  You want the best for him, even when it looks like things can't possibly work out.  He knows he should be paying more attention to his current girlfriend, Serena, but can't help himself when former girlfriend, Linda, featured in the previous two novels, comes looking for his help in finding her niece, kidnapped by her estranged father during a custody dispute.  Linda seems to have some sort of hold over him, yet the more he thinks about it, the more he realizes how much he loves Serena and that he wants to be with her.<br />Allen is an introspective, lonely guy who is quietly becoming something of a success in his chosen profession of private detective.  Yet he still finds it hard to fathom other people and he hasn't quite figured out why Serena keeps getting so mad at him during his investigation.  There's a philosophical undercurrent running through things, too, as Allen keeps coming back to the Kierkegaard he's been reading and trying to fit it into his everyday life.<br />There are some dangerous bad guys at work, and bad things happen to the people he cares about, but Allen is ultimately able to solve the mystery and make a real step forward in his relationship with Serena.  Here's hoping this series lasts a long and satisfying time.  Highly recommended!	2004-05-24

So I was excited when his second book came out.  Unfortunately, I wasn't quite as impressed by this second novel, _A Visible Darkness_.  In moving the action away from the Everglades, where his character, Max Freeman, an ex-policeman turned private detective lived in virtual isolation, a lot of the magic of the debut was lost.  Apparently, King learned from this because book three focuses again on the Everglades and is a real keeper.<br /><br />_Shadow Men_ involves the search for three men, a father and his two sons, who may have been killed 80 years before during the construction of the first road across the Everglades.  All that one of their descendants has to go by are a few letters, which hint at some rather nefarious goings-on at the work site.  Apparently, the company which had hired the men wasn't so willing to let them go, once they became disenchanted with the tropical heat and the clouds of mosquitoes.<br /><br />Someone in the present day isn't too excited either about Max and his lawyer friend, Billy Manchester, digging into this old mystery.  Apparently, if the chain of evolution (what company turned into what company, etc.) can be uncovered, a modern corporation can be held liable for something done decades ago.<br /><br />The action in the novel moves around a lot, but it remains firmly focused on the Everglades themselves, as Max and the old Gladesman Nate Brown, who made an appearance in the second book, search for what may or may not be the final resting place of the three men.  There are some great, atmospheric sequences that take place out in the swamps and a memorable scene has Max and Nate crawl into the darkness of a (hopefully) abandoned alligator hole to hide from a couple of men who are tracking them.<br /><br />Coupled with a subplot that involves Max's policewoman girlfriend and a friend of hers, also a policewoman, who is being stalked by her abusive policeman boyfriend, a subplot that connects directly to Max's past, the book literally flies along.  It is very fast-moving and, ultimately, very, very satisfying.

I think this book is even better than his Edgar-award winning _The Bottoms_.  The time and place are pretty much the same: Depression-era East Texas.  On the outskirts of the sawmill town of Camp Rapture, live Sunset Jones and her husband, Pete, the town constable.  As the novel opens, a big storm is brewing and Pete is in the middle of raping and beating his wife when she decides she's finally had enough, shooting him to death with his own gun.  The storm blows away their house and leaves Sunset to stumble into town and make her way to her mother-in-law's home.  Pete's mother, Marilyn, is angry at first, but quickly (almost too quickly?) comes to understand Sunset's actions and the reasons for them--she's had to endure the same treatment at the hands of Pete's father.  Since Marilyn is also a part owner of the sawmill, she arranges it so that Sunset becomes the new constable.<br /><br />Sunset vows to take the job seriously and, before too long, she's investigating the deaths of a woman and a baby, both found soaked in oil and buried upright in the land of a poor black farmer.  With the help of her deputies, pretty-boy Hillbilly, who's just passing through town and wants to earn the money to replace the guitar he used to fight off a couple of hobos, and Clyde, who's got a crush on Sunset, but just isn't the sort of guy to have much luck with women (he burns down his house, rather than trying to clean years of dirt inside), Sunset finds herself in the middle of a rather prickly situation.<br /><br />There are some pretty dark, sinister villains at work here, plus one of the more memorable, mish-mashed groups of heroes.  Sunset's father, Lee, has recently dropped back into her life, off of a passing freight, along with an old-before-his-time young man named Goose.  Then there's the legendary Bull Stackerlee, a huge black man that lives all by himself off in the woods and becomes something of a bodyguard for Sunset.  Through it all, Sunset discovers inner reserves of strength and nobility she didn't know she had and the whole situation builds to a violent, though very satisfying climax.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, full of unique characters that you come to care about, and a gripping story that will keep you reading.  This just might be the best book Lansdale's yet written, and if you've read him before, you'll know that's saying something.Through it all, Sunset discovers inner reserves of strength and nobility she didn't know she had and the whole situation builds to a violent, though very satisfying climax.

I'd hesitate to say \\"breakout book\\" because I think she broke out long ago, but as I read, I couldn't help but compare the experience to that of reading Dennis Lehane's _Mystic River_, which I still firmly believe is one of the best American books of the last ten years. And I do think that _Every Secret Thing_ is on par with that book.<br /><br />The story is narrated from multiple viewpoints, including those of a pair of now teenage girls, just released from juvenile detention after serving seven-year sentences for their parts in the kidnapping and death of a baby, the granddaughter of a locally-famous black judge. Ronnie Fuller and Alice Manning have had their lives irrevocably changed, and when another child of mixed race disappears soon after their return home, the girls become prime suspects, after their names are leaked to the press and to the police. At first, we feel sympathetic toward poor Alice, the \\"good\\" girl whose life was ruined by the inexplicable actions of the \\"bad\\" Ronnie, but as the story goes on, our sympathies are drawn more and more to Ronnie as the secrets of what happened seven years before, and what is happening now, are revealed.<br /><br />Set in Baltimore, the story is as much about developing character studies of the girls, their families, the police, the press, and so forth, as it is about solving the mystery. The book also presents a portrait of the racism and divisions inherent in society, not just black vs. white, but rich vs. poor, and so on. There are great passages about the struggles faced by homicide detective Nancy Porter, who found the dead baby many years ago and who is now assigned to the new investigation, that are worthy of _Homicide: Life on the Street_ or _The Wire_. Lippman draws deft portraits of both Sharon Kerpelman, the public defender who feels she failed Alice in the earlier case, and Mira Jenkins, the reporter who sees this story as her chance to \\"move downtown.\\" And Cynthia Barnes, the mother of the murdered baby, is a fully-shaded character who sees the possibility to get some sort of revenge on the girls, who she feels should have been tried as adults.<br /><br />This is a gripping story, full of tension and emotion. It has moments of sadness and moments of humor. It's a great book by a great writer and I'd be surprised if it isn't nominated for the major awards in the field this year.

Corso has relocated to Seattle and is writing a column for a third-rate paper, the _Sun_, following some sort of scandal at a paper in New York--there's mention of a libel suit, as well as Corso having made up a story, but the real trouble is never that clear.  Regardless,<br />Corso has fallen a few rungs on the ladder, lost his CNN reporter-girlfriend, and now is content to hide out on his boat, writing the occasional book and turning in his columns, whose syndication fees help keep the paper afloat.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, Leanne Samples, a somewhat simple though good-hearted girl, comes to the _Sun's_ offices to recant her testimony in the trial of Leroy Himes, the prime suspect in a series of \\"Trashman\\" rape/murders three years previously.  Leanne had thought at the time to accuse Himes of rape and save herself the embarrassment of dealing with an unwanted pregnancy and the hassle of confronting her overprotective parents.  She insists on talking only to Corso, because he was one of the few people to treat her kindly during the trial.<br /><br />Corso himself had had his doubts about Himes' guilt and written a column to that effect, but it seems as if everyone else in Seattle is content to move forward with Himes' execution, only a few days away at this point.  When he gets involved, Corso suddenly has an exclusive and people start buying the _Sun_ again.  As he digs further, in the company of his partner, freelance photographer Meg Dougherty, an unfortunate woman who was tattooed all over her body by a vengeful boyfriend, Corso discovers that the police are trying to cover-up a pair of new murders that fit the MO of the previous string and which, coupled with Leanne's recantation, pretty much guarantee Himes' innocence.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, though it was hard to warm up to Frank Corso.  He's got a rough, hard-edged exterior, although he's always got a kind word and a ready ear for life's losers, like Leanne or Himes.  He's just a bit too prickly and unfriendly to the other people in his life for him to be an attractive character.  He's especially mean to Meg, which makes the scene where the two of them fall into each others' arms that much harder to believe.<br /><br />This was the first Ford book I've read since his debut Leo Waterman mystery _Who in Hell is Wanda Fuca?_ and Waterman makes a brief appearance in this book, tying the two series together.  Ford draws a great picture of Seattle, though I'm still trying to decide if I want to spend any more time in Frank Corso's company.  I guess I'd have to give this one a rather mixed recommendation.ways got a kind word and a ready ear for life's losers, like Leanne or Himes.

The blurbs on the book led me to expect a rollicking, comedic story along the lines of Carl Hiaasen, but this was a pretty downbeat and ultimately depressing story.<br /><br />The book follows what happens when Mack MacWray, a decent, amiable guy who works as a sewer for a sportswear company is conned into leaving and starting his own clothing company by the smooth Lars Larson.  Larson will be the \\"people\\" man and Mack the \\"rag\\" man.  Everything seems to be going just great until the day that Larson, the beautiful secretary, and all the money disappear.  Mack is left holding the bag and sees his dreams, his life, go up in smoke.  His wife, a part-time travel agent, convinces him to take a short trip to Mexico, to give them a breather before coming back to deal with the mess--the broken loan, the unfilled orders, the layoff of his workers.<br /><br />While in Mexico, Mack just happens to stumble upon Lars.  It turns out Larson is a con man who has done this same thing before to a number of other poor schlubs.  The secretary, Rita, is actually his wife and they have a condo in Mexico where they live in between jobs.  Mack confronts Lars on a clifftop and an accident happens, leaving him with the choice whether to save Lars or ignore his pleas for help.<br /><br />When the MacWrays return to the States, Mack is strangely energized.  All of a sudden, he has what it takes to be completely and utterly ruthless in his business dealings and, before long, not only has he climbed out of the hole that Larson left him in, but he's making plans to expand, leasing a Mercedes, and looking to buy a big new house.  His wife's best friend is on the prowl for him and before too long, Rita shows up, looking for the contents of her and Lars' safe deposit box, which a man resembling MacWray cleaned out.<br /><br />This was a very noirish book, although for a while, the hapless loser MacWray is able to turn the tables and ride roughshod over everyone of his tormentors.  When he starts to lose some of his hard edge, the blackmailing Rita, the adulterous affair, the loans on top of loans, all start coming back to haunt him.  When his wife begins to miss the old Mack, the sensitive, communicative guy she married, and starts to suspect maybe he's having an affair with Rita, the stage is set for a rather downbeat conclusion.  I'm not sure I really liked the book, though it is certainly well-written.able to turn the tables and ride roughshod over everyone of his tormentors.

Paul is killed in what at first looks like a hit on one of their corporate clients, but as Allen digs into the mystery, he begins to realize that Paul was doing a bit of moonlighting and that one of his clients might be behind the killing.  Also, his investigation leads Allen to explore the events surrounding his own father's \\"accidental\\" death twenty years before.<br /><br />This was a great book, with Allen's introspective, lonely thoughts at the forefront.  There's a lot about what it means to be different or \\"other\\" in America, as well as Allen's personal alienation (he was brought up by an aunt who viewed him as a nuisance) and his own personal emptiness, which are at the heart of the book.  Other than his job, he doesn't have much going on in his life and when his investigation threatens his employment, things don't look good for Allen.<br /><br />Luckily, he has the help of an inexperienced lifestyles reporter for a local paper, Linda Maldonado, in unraveling the mystery.  Besides offering a compelling mystery, this book also features a sweet, unexpected, slowly-developing romance between the two (the clueless Allen doesn't realize why Linda is going out her way, risking her life and career to help him, until almost the very end).  An excellent mystery debut and I'm strongly looking forward to the second book in this series, _Underkill_.	2003-08-18

When a postal worker and a customer are found dead in a rural Montana post office, the case is given to Loomis, an inspector who travels around the state.  Dombrowski, a former pro football player, is flown in from Seattle and is the primary on the case, but he lets Gillian take charge of the investigation.  Gillian is a former Seattle policewoman who quit after accidentally killing a young boy while on duty, and, since then, she has refused to carry a weapon, which is a breach of duty for a postal inspector.<br />The deaths appear to have some connection to a cache of old letters, found when an old safe and other equipment was moved from the old post office to a new one.  The letters were written by a man named Sharpless Walker, who was lynched way back in 1918, and appear to have something to do with the sinking of the Lusitania.  As Max and Gillian investigate, they begin to uncover a conspiracy that at first appears to reach to the highest levels of both the American and British governments.<br />This was a great, old-fashioned page turner.  Rice does a great job of creating his conspiracy and then doling out the clues bit by bit, ratcheting up the tension and suspense.  Max and Gillian are interesting characters and we come to care about them as they are besieged on all sides, by assassins and by higher-ups in both the Postal Inspection Service and the FBI, who may or may not be trustworthy.  Rice also does a good job of drawing the scenery of rural Montana, as the two drive from place to place, pursuing the investigation.  This was a riveting book and I for one would like to see another book involving these characters.  Highly recommended.	2003-07-28

Christopher lives in Swindon, England, with his father and has a rather complex set of rules by which he lives his life (i.e., if he sees 4 red cars in a row, this means it will be a Good Day, while 4 yellow cars in a row makes it a Black Day).<br />When he discovers a neighbor's dog killed by a garden fork one night, Christopher is a suspect at first, but then he sets out to discover the true culprit, modeling his search after the techniques of Sherlock Holmes.  He does ultimately solve the mystery, which grows to encompass what happened to his mother, who his father has told him died of a heart attack in the hospital.<br /><br />What a great book this was, at turns funny and very sad, sometimes at the same time.  Christopher is an amazingly well-realized character, logical to a fault (the chapters are numbered with prime numbers), yet entirely unable to fathom the most basic emotions in others.  He takes and passes A-level maths and dreams of attending university and becoming a scientist, yet his failure at the most basic of human interactions makes one see how impossible this dream really is.  It's not that often that a book really hits me, but this one left me with a lump in my throat when I was finished.  An amazing first novel.	2003-07-28

When I first read a blurb about this a few months back, it sounded great--just the sort of book I would like. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work.<br /><br />Wright's protagonist is John Ray Horn, a former cowboy movie star who played the character of Sierra Lane in dozens of low-budget westerns during the 1930s and 1940s, before being sent to prison for two years for assault. Since his release, he's been working as a collection agent for his friend Joseph Mad Crow, who used to be his faithful Indian sidekick in the movies.  Horn finds that having to occasionally muscle late payments out of the dead-beat fathers of boys who remember Sierra Lane isn't much fun.<br /><br />When his friend, rich playboy Scotty Bullard, contacts him regarding a cache of photos he's discovered in the desk of his recently deceased father, a real estate mogul, Horn discovers that one of the underage girls posed in a provocative manner is Clea, who for a brief time was his stepdaughter, in a marriage that didn't last his prison stint. When Scotty is killed shortly thereafter, Horn gets involved in the search for his killer, as well as the group of men who were involved in the picture-taking and worse.<br /><br />As I said, there is a lot of potential here. Even reviewing my quick plot intro, the book still sounds like a grabber. With its hero who can't quite live up to his onscreen heroics (there are some flashbacks to his time in WWII, when he came face-to-face with paralyzing fear) and the neat reversal of roles with his Indian partner, as well as the time period, an era when Los Angeles was going through fast growth and development (not too far removed from the time portrayed in _Chinatown_), and careful attention to period detail and history, all the elements would seem to be in place for a riveting novel. Unfortunately, this just isn't it. The book is very slow-moving and covers some of the same ground over and over, as Horn searches for the missing Clea, finds her, then loses her, then has to find her again. Wright tends to over-write and he has a hard time keeping the pace moving. Ultimately, the book is just sort of dull and was a real disappointment. I might still give a second John Horn book a chance, but it would have to correct some of the flaws in this first outing.e ground over and over, as Horn searches for the missing Clea, finds her, then loses her, then has to find her again.

This is a very scary, very well-written novel, but it doesn't have a lot of gross-out shocks. Instead, it is a rather slow moving novel that builds and builds in suspense until a very satisfying climax and conclusion. I've read Clegg's work before and been disappointed by it, but in all fairness, I must say that this book finally lives up the hype I've read about him. An excellent book which was hard to put down--in fact, I read it in one sitting. Highly recommended!	2003-06-23

I'm not really sure whether it's the recent discussion of Child and Reacher on the Dorothyl listserv or the fact that the book was sent to me as an ARC and I felt like I had to read it, but I just never warmed up to the character.  Or maybe it's because I'm coming to it mid-series (I'm one of those readers who likes to start at the beginning and read in order).<br /><br />Whatever the case, I can see the point of those who complain that Reacher is something of a superhero.  No one could take the constant abuse he does.  He swims in the freezing ocean.  He beats up steroid-enhanced bad guys.  He kills dozens of faceless, cardboard bad guys.  The thing I was most bothered by is his cold-bloodedness.  Sure, the bad guys in the book are really bad guys, but Reacher could give Richard Stark's Parker a run for his money in the emotionless, steely-determination department.  He doesn't seem to care--he's a killing machine--and that got old.  I was especially bothered by the way he does away with the main bad guy, who had escaped his wrath ten years previously--with a slowly-inserted, razor-sharp chisel to the head!  Yuck!  Maybe the guy deserved it (he's drawn as a very, very bad guy in the book), but Reacher shouldn't be enjoying it.<br /><br />At one point in the book, Reacher quotes Nietzsche--\\"whatever doesn't destroy us, makes us stronger.\\"  I think he needs to review the quote (also Nietzsche?) about how, when you're chasing monsters, you'd better be careful not to become one yourself.  I guess it was the whole casualness with which the violence is handled that bothered me about the book, and I'm not someone who shies away from violence or from dark books.  I don't think I'll be reading more in this series.  A disappointment.<br /><br />**UPDATE**:7/21/2009--I've actually read several more of Child's Reacher novels and they've become \\"must-read\\" books for me. That said, this is still one of the weakest books in this series.	2003-06-11

The book is particularly useful, in that it isn't directed only to first-time planners/purchasers, but can also be used effectively by those librarians who are evaluating existing systems and thinking about a replacement, a circumstance this reviewer finds himself in at the moment.<br /><br /> Each chapter is clearly laid out, with checklists and other charts, which may be photocopied and used as appropriate.  At the end of each chapter, there is an annotated list of bibliographic references which may consulted for futher information.  The authors take readers through the planning process, to providing advice on how to deal with vendors and service providers, to reviewing the system once it is in place and how to plan for the future.  There are chapters on MARC records cataloging, retrospective conversion, and new standards for emerging formats, such as e-books, as well as an appendix on how to deal with outside consultants.<br /><br />All in all, this book is one of the more effectively written and organized texts that this reviewer has come across.

I think McKnight is a good writer, and I've enjoyed this series overall.  But I don't know if I'll rush to put these books on the top of my TBR pile when they come out in the future.  I think part of the reason for this is that Hamilton just doesn't seem inclined to give readers a traditional mystery.  I imagine that there are some for whom this is a blessing.  But I just don't know how much longer I can put up with McKnight's \\"reluctant investigator\\" persona.<br /><br />In this book, Alex decides to help out his friend Vinnie, first introduced in _Winter of the Wolf Moon_.  Vinnie is an Ojibwa Indian and he's worried because his brother Tom is overdue in returning from a moose hunt in Canada.  To make things worse, because he was just recently released from prison and is on parole, Tom isn't supposed to leave the country, so Vinnie loaned him his identification.<br />Alex and Vinnie drive north to the isolated hunting lodge where Tom and his party of hunters, a group from Detroit, were to head out into the wilderness.  They find the owners of the camp shutting things down, for probably the last time, since the number of hunting parties coming there has been dropping steadily.  According to the man who owns the lodge, Tom and his group came back on schedule and drove off in their SUV.  When the vehicle is later found abandoned on a local Indian reservation, things begin to look suspicious.<br /><br />There are some great things in this book.  Hamilton does a very good job with character, creating real, believable people who it is a pleasure to spend time with.  Also, the book does a great job of exploring male friendship and the lengths to which people are willing to go to help each other out.  Vinnie had sent Tom on the hunt in the first place because he was scared his brother might try to commit suicide and he thought the trip was just what he needed.  And people are constantly commenting on the lengths to which Alex goes to help out Vinnie.<br /><br />This brings up another of Hamilton's strengths, which is his descriptions of nature and setting.  When Alex and Vinnie convince an old Indian guide, Maskwa, to fly them out to the isolated lake where Tom and his hunting party were last seen, the two of them decide to stay there overnight.  They can't foresee the sequence of events that will leave them stranded, with no way to get a message back to civilization, at the mercy of at least one unknown person armed with a high-powered rifle.  This sequence, which lasts for a couple of chapters, contains some of the most vivid descriptions of the outdoors that I've encountered for awhile.<br /><br />The thing that really threw me though is the whole mystery aspect of the book.  Just what is going on and what happened to Tom and the hunting party is left unexplained until the very end.  There just isn't a lot of investigating going on in the book.  Instead, the book turns into a travelogue of Vinnie and Alex driving around, asking questions, trying to find some trace of the missing hunters.  All of their driving around is presented in quite a bit of detail, including several trips back and forth from northern Ontario to Paradise, Michigan, the series' home.  The solution to the mystery, ultimately, is sad and satisfying, but it is so delayed as to be rather annoying.  There isn't even a hint about what's going on until the last couple of chapters.<br /><br />I guess I'd recommend the book, but I'm still waiting for Hamilton to recapture some of the magic of earlier books in the series, particularly _Winter of the Wolf Moon_, my favorite so far.  I hope the next book, if there is one, will be a bit more traditional./>  <br />This brings up another of Hamilton's strengths, which is his descriptions of nature and setting.

From obvious, Las Vegas-lensed features such as _Casino_ and _Leaving Las Vegas_, to films shot in lesser-known locales, such as _The Shootist_, John Wayne's last picture, filmed in the area around Carson City, Gary DuVal's _The Nevada Filmography_ does a comprehensive job of profiling films shot in the state between 1897 and 2000.  The book covers both films that used Nevada as a primary location, as well as those which shot only briefly in the state for brief sequences.<br /><br />The book is arranged alphabetically by title, and each entry provides complete information on cast and crew, as well as technical information and production credits.  Also included in each entry is information on the locale.  There are five appendices that cover locations, chronological listings of the films in the book, awards the films received, an extensive listing of alternative titles, and films available on videocassette.  There are also a number of black-and-white photos of behind the scenes moments on some of the films.<br /><br />This is an interesting book, with a lot of good information and behind-the-scenes anecdotes about the films.  For example, the entry for the original _Ocean's Eleven_ (1960) includes mention of the fact that Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack made the film during a two-week engagement at the Sands casino, performing at night and filming during the day: \\"all the Las Vegas scenes were completed during the Rat Pack's two-week engagement at the Sands, which made for very long days for the stars.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, not all entries are as informative.  The careful attention to detail in the cast and crew information, material which could be easily researched using the Internet Movie Database, often overshadows a one-sentence mention of the locations where a film was made.  And the extended anecdotes and notes are rather few and far between, reserved only for the highest profile pictures.<br /><br />It is hard to gauge who the intended audience is for this book.  It would most likely be of interest to Nevada libraries, for general or film reference collections.  It would also be of use to any library with a comprehensive collection of film books or Western memorabilia.  But the cover price probably rules it out for most general collections.It is hard to gauge who the intended audience is for this book.

Stanley's book offers a variety of methods for introducing students and instructors alike to the idea that research is in fact a process, including step-by-step lesson plans and techniques which detail each step in that process, from finding and developing a topic to collecting the information, organizing it, and creating a final project.  The book shows exactly how to plan and prepare for teaching students about the research process, a process which is often overlooked in the rush to assign essays and other projects which require a modicum of research.<br /><br />If anything, the book attempts to do too much, with the first sections devoted to very specific instructions for the neophyte library/media specialist.  Stanley gets a bit bogged-down in such details as the scheduling of the media center, designing a master calendar, and so forth for the book to be entirely successful at accomplishing its stated goal.  In fact, out of the four main sections within the book, only one is devoted to the actual research process, with perhaps a bit too much emphasis placed on the value and importance of note-taking as a part of the process.<br /><br />Still, _Practical Steps to the Research Process for Middle School_, which is primarily aimed at an audience of library/media specialists, is a useful source, with many charts and other graphics that could be taken directly for use as handouts or overheads.  In fact, the book would be a useful source for any middle school instructor interested in teaching his/her students more about the research process.	2003-05-28

The authors indicate, in the book's introduction, that this is \\"not strictly speaking a how-to-do-it book so much as a how-it-has-been-done book\\" and this phrase succinctly sums up the book, as well as pointing to its strengths and weaknesses.  The book largely succeeds as an overview of the motives for evaluation and the processes by which it can be carried out.  Yet, librarians looking for a more practical guide to the actual steps by which an evaluation project might be carried out will need to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Organized into six chapters, each devoted to a specific area of evaluation, the book presents a series of case studies, meant to provide specific, individual examples of evaluation projects which have been carried out.  Some of these examples are very useful, reflecting a specific, recognized problem, with a step-by-step approach to developing a solution and evaluating that solution.  In these instances, the approach to evaluating and solving the problems really could be used, with little change, by other libraries.<br /><br />In other instances, the case studies are less useful, as a particular solution is put forth, without much in the way of specific supporting evidence that this solution really is the best solution.  The solution is assumed to be the best way of solving the problem and the evaluation appears tailored to supporting this assumption.<br /><br />The book is primarily useful as an introduction to the idea of evaluation, as a means of opening a dialogue on evaluation and the need for it.  Experienced librarians will probably find this less useful than new or beginning librarians.  It would likely be of particular interest to library and information science students in library management courses.	2003-05-28

When the checks first started arriving, he did some minimal checking around to see if he could find the company or discern the reason for the checks, but his efforts never panned out.  Now, many years later, he's approached by a stranger, who tells him \\"You are now active.\\"<br /><br />Josh is drawn into a dangerous world of spies and espionage with this simple command, and everything he does to try to pry himself loose seems to be of no avail, as he gets mired deeper and deeper in the scheme to assassinate the visiting head of an Eastern European dictatorship.<br /><br />This is a weird mix of humor and seriousness.  As Josh and a fellow agent, Mitch Robbie, go about trying to extricate themselves, there are a lot of humorous scenes.  But the whole book ultimately builds to a violent climax that requires Josh to stand up to his captors and turn the tables on them and is deadly serious.  I enjoyed the book, but it isn't on par with recent work by Westlake, such as _Bad News_ or _Put a Lid On It_.	2003-04-29

This is a plot twist that pretty much blows the book apart--if you're even a tiny bit familiar with the Bosch series, this is going to hurt your reading. This twist marks the beginning of a three-book downturn for Connelly, which he's only recently recovered from with _Lost Light_.	2003-04-25

It is his best book and it should have won him an Edgar award in the year it was published. His Kenzie-Gennaro series is also very strong, with a couple of titles real stand-outs (_A Drink Before the War_ and _Darkness, Take My Hand_). Unfortunately, his new book just isn't in the same league.<br />Now, this is probably going to earn me a lot of &quot;unhelpful&quot; votes, but _Shutter Island_ just isn't that great a book, especially when you compare it to the work Lehane has done previously. The book reads like a screenplay, which perhaps it might have been. It has twists and turns galore, including one giant concluding twist that may leave readers saying &quot;Huh?&quot; I enjoyed the book and its very sad conclusion, but I just can't go along with the others who've said that this is or might be Lehane's best book. Compared to his usual flawless command of the dark heart of humanity, _Shutter Island_ has to be seen as little more than a trifle. Sure, you'll enjoy it, but I don't think the book will stay with you the way the more mature _Mystic River_ does. By all means, you should read this novel, especially if you're a Dennis Lehane fan, but don't feel like you have to rush right out and get it now.	2003-04-23

His last three books have had some fairly major problems with them that really detracted from my enjoyment, with _Chasing the Dime_, in particular, a real standout for poor writing.<br /><br />So when I picked up his latest, _Lost Light_, a new Harry Bosch novel, I didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised by a book that is one of the best he's ever written.<br />The book picks up with Harry a year after his retirement from the LAPD. He's got a comfortable pension that more than provides for his needs and he's looking for something to fill the time. Lately, he's been visiting an old jazzman at a retirement home and taking saxophone lessons, but it's not enough. So when he's called by another retired policeman, Lawton Cross, who was shot in the line of duty and is now paralyzed, Harry goes to see him. Cross wants him to look into an unsolved case that involves both of them. Four years earlier, Harry was investigating the murder of a young production assistant. Her body had been found with the clothes torn, in a manner that suggested a random sexual assault/ murder. When, a few days later, a movie set was robbed of $2 million in actual money, the earlier murder was re-evaluated and Harry and his partners lost the case, to Cross and his partner from Robbery-Homicide.<br />Harry retraces some of the work that was done and from there, the case gets even more complicated as it grows to include the disappearance of a star female FBI agent, and even overlaps with homeland security.<br />This is a very fast-moving story, told, unusually, from the first-person point of view, so that we get more insight into Harry and his thoughts and motivations. The sequences involving the homeland security plot thread are suitably scary and raise issues of constitutional rights and what can happen when the rules are basically thrown out the window. There's a rogue FBI agent in the book who makes the police who beat up Rodney King look fairly tame.<br /><br />There aren't any of the rather [weak] plot twists that have hurt Connelly's recent books. It's all very believable and it ultimately builds to a very, very touching finale, though once again, as with the conclusion to _City of Bones_, it's kind of hard to see where Harry Bosch will go next. I know I for one will be looking forward to that next book.Rodney King look fairly tame.<br /> <br />There aren't any of the rather [weak] plot twists that have hurt Connelly's recent books.

I keep reading and hearing that he's the logical successor to Stephen King and Peter Straub, but from my experience, he still has a long way to go.  _The Infinite_ starts off well, with in-depth introductions to the three main characters.  They are individuals and not cookie-cutter stereotypes.  But when the three finally arrive at Harrow for a week of \\"ghost hunting,\\" things slow way down and very little happens.  Then, we're treated to a very rushed and illogical climax and conclusion.<br />I had basically the same experience with _Call_--a story that was so slowly developed and characters created with great attention and loving detail, ultimately fell apart when it came time for something to happen.  Clegg needs to develop his entire plot in the same level of detail.  For _The Infinite_, this would probably mean another two or three hundred pages of material, but it would be worth it if he could turn in a book that maintains the same high level all the way through.  This was a very disappointing book.	2002-11-14

More and more, Michael Connelly's books seem to involve rather unbelievable plots and to require his characters to do things that are stupid, unbelievable, or just plain out of character. Why Henry Pierce, the protagonist of this new book, doesn't just change his phone number when he starts getting calls for a missing prostitute, is never really clear. Oh sure, Connelly attempts to provide an explanation in the form of a backstory involving his missing, then found dead, sister, but it never really rings true. It just doesn't successfully explain the obsession he has with finding the other girl, in the face of a couple of one-dimensional, paper thin bad guys who beat him up and hang him off the balcony of his twelfth floor apartment, or the impending visit of a financier who might be the savior he's been looking for, for his molecular computing firm. It's hard to believe that the main cop in the investigation puts his sights on Pierce, because, dontcha know, the Good Samaritan often turns out to be the perpetrator (I'm sure this is true, but it can't explain the extended harassment this guy gives Pierce). Then Pierce suddenly puts all the pieces together and suspects his ex-girlfriend must be behind it all (shades of Terry McCaleb suspecting that Harry Bosch is a killer in _A Darkness More Than Night_). It all rings false--something like the \\"idiot plot\\" of Roger Ebert, in which characters act in idiotic ways because the plot requires it, not out of believable motivations arising from their characters.  Still, it was fast-moving and there is some interesting material about molecular computers and how they may change the world. But, ultimately, it's a real disappointment from a \\"master\\" like Connelly.	2002-10-21

It's not a bad book, but just a bit too madcap for me.<br />Basically, the book follows John Marlin (what an original name that is!) as he investigates a drug smuggling ring that uses the unique method of sewing up cocaine into the bodies of the prize game deer owned by a local businessman/political hustler who swindled his game ranch from one of Marlin's old friends.  There are plenty of weird characters and a lot of forced hilarity, but the whole thing just didn't work for me.  I think Rehder was trying way too hard with this book and I hope he'll ease up a bit if there's a second novel in this series.	2002-10-17

This is the latest Repairman Jack novel, a series which combines noir/mystery/crime novel with elements of horror and science fiction.  Jack is one of the combatants in the battle between the Otherness and the Ally, a battle that's been raging throughout Wilson's novels and serves to tie most of them together into one continuum.  In this book, Jack is faced with impending fatherhood and what that will mean to his shadowy, off-the-books existence.  He also has to deal with the apparent ghost of a young girl who is haunting the house of a con-man/ psychic and his born-again brother, as well as a mysterious man who hires him to shadow his \\"brother\\" and prevent him from committing any crimes during the next full moon.  All of this material comes together in a very satisfying way, leaving one wanting more.  Wilson is one of those writers who just doesn't write fast enough.<br />Jack is a great creation, sort of the Equalizer crossed with the X-Files, and if you haven't experienced this series yet, you owe it to yourself to seek it out (other titles are _The Tomb_, _Legacies_, _Conspiracies_, _All the Rage_, and _Hosts_).	2002-10-17

The book concerns a weird car-like thing that is discovered outside a gas station and then moved into one of the garages behind a Pennsylvania state trooper barracks.<br />It looks like a Buick, but it won't hold mud, the wheels don't keep gravel in the treads, and scratches and dents disappear overnight.  And then there's the occasional &quot;light storm&quot; followed by strange creatures which appear out of the &quot;car's&quot; trunk.  And the occasional person or creature that seems to disappear while in the &quot;car's&quot; presence.<br />The book chronicles the experiences that the troopers in this particular station have had with the car ever since it was first discovered some 30 years before.  The son of a trooper recently killed in the line of duty has been hanging out at the barracks, doing odd jobs and learning to be a dispatcher, when he convinces the troopers to tell him the story of the car, which was a topic of particular fascination to his dead father.<br />This is a very entertaining novel, told from multiple points of view and a variety of different narrative voices, and ultimately, it seems to be about the difficulty of finding meaning in life.  The troopers never do discover the secret behind the car (is it a lost/displaced piece of alien machinery?) and the story doesn't really seem to have a climax or denouement (although, ultimately, the novel does).<br /><br />This is a great book and will make a great movie, if the right person picks it up (I can see Frank Darabont being drawn to this material).	2002-10-17

It isn't exactly the most inspired of plots and the characters are pretty derivative (as others have noted)--John Eliot, the protagonist, is a pretty-thinly disguised version of Sherlock Holmes, for example.  But there is something undeniably gripping about this story.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly that Holland has brought to the table, only that I found myself unable to stop reading.  Maybe it's the epistolary structure (the novel is told through letters, diaries, and journal entries), each fragment given a suitably unique voice as it pushes the story forward.  Perhaps the strongest part of the book are the early scenes in India, as a group of &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; British soldiers are sent to a mysterious region on the frontier and find themselves face to face with Russian zombie/vampires.  Holland's attempt to bring real-life characters (Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker) into the story to mingle with his fictional creations has been done better elsewhere (notably, Tim Powers' _The Stress of Her Regard_), but the whole package, ultimately, shapes up as something pretty memorable.  Recommended!	2002-10-07

Clark is one of the strongest writers to enter the horror field in a long time, maybe since Clive Barker first broke on the scene with his Books of Blood.  That said, I have to say I was rather disappointed by _Darker_.  This is a rather silly novel, with characters that are pretty one-dimensional.  The whole &quot;invisible force&quot; that must be kept under control, lest it start to hammer people and objects flat, has to be one of the stranger plots for a horror novel.  I can't fault Clark for his originality here.  Unfortunately, he doesn't do much with this idea and the book just doesn't match up to the amazing heights of his other work.  Check out _Vampyrrhic_ or _Blood Crazy_ first.  Wait until you're a Clark fanatic and must read everything he's written before you try _Darker_.	2002-10-04

Box is an excellent writer and this is a very fast-moving and gripping story.  There are echoes of Nevada Barr here, as well as other writers who've written about the West and Western themes, but I found myself reminded more of William Kent Krueger, a Minnesota-based author.  Both Box and Krueger are masters at developing setting and both write about lead characters who are primarily family men, concerned with keeping their loved ones out of harm's way.  The main similarity, though, was in the extended chase that makes up most of the second half of the book--it reminded me very much of Krueger's _Boundary Waters_, which also has an extended chase through the wilderness.  One of the things I really like about Box's work so far is that the bad guys get what's coming to them--they meet their well-deserved just desserts.  Here, it's in a very memorable and fitting way.  Also, it should be noted that Box doesn't really take sides--his story concerns the clash between environmentalists and ranchers in the West and both sides come off looking pretty bad, though the ranchers might just be a shade worse (they have, after all, hired a crazy stock detective to eliminate key environmentalists).  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be impatiently looking for Mr. Box's next Joe Pickett novel.	2002-07-02

Patrick and Angela are called on to investigate the disappearance of four-year-old Amanda McCready, who lives with an awful, distracted, zero of a mother.  Her inattention to her daughter and her needs is painted so vividly that it is easy to hope that, wherever she is, Amanda's life is somehow better.  This disappearance leads the detectives into a morass of drug dealers and pedophiles and crooked police.<br />Ultimately, it all leads to a gripping, heart-breaking climax that is pretty much a no-win situation for all involved.  Sure, there are some contrivances in the plot that bring us to this point--as other reviewers have pointed out--but this is still one heck of a powerful book, with vivid characters and a real sense of setting and community.  We can see how the neighborhood gives birth to monsters like Cheese Olamon and Angie's and Patrick's \\"friend\\" Bubba, while others choose another route for their lives.  This is a step up from the previous book, Sacred, and shows Lehane getting ready for the powerhouse book to come, Mystic River.	2002-06-24

I'd never read this author before, but am I glad I discovered his work--I've already ordered copies of a couple of his other books.<br /><br />Danny Chaisson, former bagman for a corrupt Louisiana politician, is trying to make his fledgling law practice a success.  He's contacted by his former wife, now a corporate attorney with a high-powered real estate developer, to come in and look after her client's interests when an elderly black man is injured after trying to get a trio of white boys to leave the slave burying field near the man's house alone.  It seems the burying field is at the center of a proposed new commercial development and no one knew it was there because it wasn't on any of the local maps.  There's some suspicion the boys were somehow influenced to go out to the field and knock over headstones and the whole mess could easily erupt into a federal issue.  Then, when a body is discovered in the burying field that is not of the same vintage as the other remains, it appears that the body of a young black girl who disappeared twenty years earlier has finally been discovered.<br /><br />This is a great book, with believable characters and careful attention to settings.  Danny is a sympathetic character, trying to make up for what he did, and his new wife, Mickie Vega, a Hispanic ATF agent who is a bit perturbed by the changes her pregnancy has forced upon her, is also quite memorable.  Danny has a black friend named Jabril who is a former drug dealer and who comes along to help Danny get a feel for the lay of the land as he comes to realize that this very complex mess may tie in somehow to his client.  And there are some pretty scary, racist villains.<br /><br />Excellent characterizations, excellent dialogue--this book receives my strongest recommendation.	2002-06-17

It brings back the character of FBI agent Pendergast (no first name is ever given) who figured prominently in both _Relic_ and _Reliquary_, along with Nora Kelly, from _Thunderhead_, and the annoying reporter Bill Smithback, who appeared in all three of these earlier books.  It also brings their attention back to New<br />York City and its environs, including the New York Museum of Natural History.<br /><br />When construction workers digging a foundation for a new high-rise uncover an abandoned coal tunnel filled with the dismembered and strangely dissected bodies of 36 young men and women, agent Pendergast shows up at Nora Kelly's door, dragging her to investigate the scene, before it is demolished by an over-eager developer.  The two of them continue to dig into the case of what begins to appear to be one of America's earliest and most prolific serial killers.  The action moves between the sub-basements of the museum, memorably presented in the Relic books, and a number of sites throughout the city.  This is a fast-moving and very fun book, with a lot of neat historical background on the city, as well as the &quot;cabinets of curiosities&quot; of the title: the collections of wealthy young men, which pre-dated and in many cases were absorbed by the museums which came along later in the century.<br /><br />I've enjoyed all of the Preston/Child books I've read, and this is one of their best.  Very highly recommended.	2002-06-11

As with<br />_Tell No One_, he's constructed a plot here that contains twists and turns and new surprises all the way to the last page.  In fact, there are almost too many twists and turns--the book, at times, reads like he was thinking to himself \\"Ha, they'll never<br />see this one coming!\\"  It's to his credit that the book holds together.<br />Will Klein, whose brother Ken is suspected in the murder of Will's former girlfriend eleven years previously, and who has been on the run ever since, is suddenly faced with evidence that the brother he'd thought dead is actually still alive.  Will's new girlfriend, Sheila Rogers, disappears one night and her disappearance somehow seems to be linked to Ken.  As Will and his friend Squares, a Covenant House driver/counselor and yoga master, investigate, they discover that Sheila was not quite what she appeared to be and she may indeed have had a connection to Will's murdered girlfriend.<br />It takes awhile for all the threads to come together in this complicated book, but it was worth sticking with it.  _Gone For Good_ is a fast-moving story with a variety of unusual and unsavory characters.  Coben does a good job of misdirecting our expectations here and he creates a pretty memorable psycho-killer character in John \\"the Ghost\\" Asselta, who may not be all that psycho after all.

This book chronicles the welcome and overdue return of Estleman's character Peter Macklin, here a retired hitman for the Detroit mob.  A newlywed on his honeymoon, Macklin is spotted by an associate of Carlo Maggiore, &quot;Carl Major&quot;, an old acquaintance and onetime target, who presses him into doing one more job.  Macklin's young bride is monitored by Abilene, a pseudo-cowboy associate of Maggiore's and during the course of his duties, he lets slip who Macklin is and also shows off his own psycho tendencies, leading Laurie Macklin to attempt to slip his clutches.<br /><br />The book switches back and forth from San Antonio, the site of Macklin's hit, to Los Angeles, and is very effective in building suspense, and supplying the viewpoints of several characters, including a detective transplanted to Texas from the Midwest and concerned about becoming too much of a Texan.<br />Macklin is a hard, tough character who previously appeared in Estleman's _Kill Zone_, _Any Man's Death_, and _Roses Are Dead_.  He's reminiscent of Richard Stark's tough guy, Parker, though Parker is a thief who only kills when he has to, while Macklin is a killer, first and foremost.  Hopefully, we won't have to wait another 10 years or more for the next Macklin book.	2002-05-02

Recently, I was reading book reviews in either _Booklist_ or _Library Journal_ and came across a rave for the latest Mankell translation, _One Step Behind_.  When my next opportunity to order a few books came around, I put several Mankell titles on the list and _Faceless Killers_ is the first in his Kurt Wallander series.  Mankell is a Swedish author and his books are translations and have been hailed as the first series to truly live up to the standards set by authors Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo and their Martin Beck mysteries.  I can't comment on that, never having read a Martin Beck, but I sure enjoyed this book.<br /><br />As the story opens, an elderly farmer discovers that his neighbors, also elderly, have been attacked.  The husband has been gruesomely tortured and killed and his wife left for dead.  Before she dies in the hospital, her last word is \\"foreign.\\"  With anti-immigrant sentiment running high already, the last thing the police need is for this to slip out to the media, but someone in the department leaks the information and suddenly refugee camps in the area are being firebombed.  When a Somali refugee is killed, seemingly at random, Wallander and his men have two difficult cases to untangle.<br /><br />This was a very strong mystery, with a great central character and careful attention to settings.  Wallander is cut from the same cloth as John Rebus and Alan Banks.  He's struggling with loneliness after his wife has unexpectedly left him and his close ties with his daughter have been severed.  He has to deal with an aging, possibly senile, father and his attraction to the new female district attorney who is filling in on an interim basis, and who happens to be married.  Plus, he's drinking too much and putting on weight due to a steady diet of pizza and fast food.<br /><br />Wallander is a compelling character who spends much of his time brooding about the state of the world and the state of his society and, interestingly, he seems to have some sympathy for the anti-immigrant mentality.  He's concerned that just about anyone can come to the country and request asylum, even crooks and shady characters.  And, the way the system is painted in the book, with officials unsure of where to locate specific refugees, etc., we can see how the task of the police is made much more difficult than it need be.  But tracking down the murderer of the Somali refugee is his job and he does it, even when a former policeman seems to have some connection to the crime.<br /><br />A very interesting mystery and one that held my attention throughout.

Highly recommended.thy for the anti-immigrant mentality.  He's concerned that just about anyone can come to the country and request asylum, even crooks and shady characters.  And, the way the system is painted in the book, with officials unsure of where to locate specific refugees, etc., we can see how the task of the police is made much more difficult than it need be.  But tracking down the murderer of the Somali refugee is his job and he does it, even when a former policeman seems to have some connection to the crime.    A very interesting mystery and one that held my attention throughout.  Even though the murders which open the book seem to be impossible to solve, Wallander will not let them go.

US	52969730	R3V39FZY7TIUSZ	0345435281	796467564	Vitals	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Great Idea but Poor Execution	This was a very gripping and frightening book that ultimately fell apart.  I'd read Bear before--both _Darwin's Radio_ and _Blood Music_--so I had high hopes for this book and they were largely met, for about the first 3/4 or so of the book.  Ultimately, though, the book does NOT come to a satisfactory conclusion.  Nothing is resolved and the main character is just adrift.  And this doesn't read like the set-up for a sequel.  It's just a disappointing non-ending.  And that's sad, because Bear's idea here, that the same bacteria/genes which might hold the secret to immortality are also the key to mind control, is pretty well-developed, with some pretty dark, horrifying hints as to what the Soviets, who stumbled upon the secret 70 years ago, were doing with it.  I liked the characters and felt that there was plenty of intrigue to the book, but I sure would have appreciated a conclusion that wrapped things up a bit more.	2002-03-12

There's almost too much going on, if that's possible.  Farris paints a scary portrait of what happens when the country's First Lady gets it into her head to try to take over the White House.  Luckily for her, she's got the forces of MORG, a government agency devoted to developing psychic espionage, on her side.  Other than a strange side trip to a community of shapeshifters and an ending that comes a bit too quickly (and easily, given the buildup), this is a very satisfying read and proves that Farris has lost none of his prodigious skill as a writer of truly thrilling thrillers.	2002-02-27

Unfortunately, he doesn't avoid the slump altogether, he just delays it a bit.  _Sacred_ is something of a disappointment after the one, two punch of his first two Kenzie/Gennaro books.  It isn't as dark and there's quite a bit more humor on display--maybe that's the problem?  I wasn't looking for Carl Hiaasen--I mean, when I pick up a Lehane, I'm expecting the dark, grim approach to life that the first two books set as the standard.  This isn't a bad book--it is incredibly fast-moving (I still can't believe I read the whole thing in one day)--but it is probably the weakest book by Lehane that I've read (besides the first two Kenzie/Gennaro's, I've also read the amazing _Mystic River_--not nominated for the Edgar?

Finished _Blackwater Sound_ last night and it's another winner.  I always feel like I'm doing him a bit of a disservice because I get so into the books I don't want to set them down, and I tend to read faster and faster.  I know I'm not giving all the lyrical descriptions of the setting, etc. (on a par with those of James Lee Burke), the attention they deserve.  And now I have to wait another two(?) years for the next one.<br /><br />In this book, Hall brings together Thorn, his series character, with Alexandra Collins, the crime scene photographer he introduced in _Body Language_.  Thorn is out on his boat one night when he witnesses the crash of a jetliner, which narrowly misses him as it makes a water landing.  First on the scene, he swoops in to rescue survivors and spots another boat nearby, with a trio of suspicious-looking folks just standing by, not doing much to help.  Later, onshore, he's threatened with a monster knife by a big, baby-faced kid, Johnny Braswell, one of the three.<br />This draws him into a complex mystery involving a HERF gun, capable of knocking out the electronic systems of jets, cars, banks, etc., and the Braswell family, who are some of the scariest villains Hall's created yet (and if you've read his work, you know that's something).<br /><br />Since Alexandra's father, Lawton, who suffers from Alzheimer's, is pulled into the mix, when he's kidnapped by the Braswells, she gets involved and it isn't long before she runs into Thorn and his friend Sugarman.  There's the usual mix of darkly humorous dialogue, over the top violence, truly evil bad guys, and the virtuous, moral influence of Thorn.  Though he isn't really a detective, he does fulfill the same role, relying on his own personal code of ethics to see things through.  And Hall is great at describing settings, too.  Whenever I read one of these books, the first thing I want to do is book a fishing<br />vacation to South Florida.  Very highly recommended.	2002-02-07

Over the weekend, I read Donaldson's new book, titled _The Man Who Fought Alone_.  This is either the fourth or fifth Mick &quot;Brew&quot; Axbrewder mystery, but the first published under Donaldson's own name (the others were published under the pseudonym &quot;Reed Stephens&quot;--guess we know what the &quot;R.&quot; stands for).<br /><br />This was an excellent book, though at first I wasn't sure I was going to like it.  As the book opens, Brew and his partner, Ginny Fistoulari (there are some really memorable names in this book) have just relocated to the city of Carner, after a run-in with the criminal elements of their former hometown, Puerta del Sol, has left Brew with a bullet wound in the stomach.  As he's recovering, and feeling sorry for himself, Ginny seeks out an old acquaintance and lands a job with his detective firm.  Brew starts to look for a job and winds up at the same firm, which recommends him as extra security for a martial arts tournament that is coming up.<br /><br />This was where the book really hooked me.  I didn't care for all the wishy-washy angst at the beginning, which reminded me a lot of Donaldson's Thomas Covenant fantasy series and why I finally had to stop reading it.  Brew, a recovering alcoholic, has begun to feel like a burden to Ginny, and circumstances have forced them apart and he's wondering how he'll continue on without her, etc., etc.  But once he's hired to watch over the tournament, this becomes a really interesting book.<br /><br />As Brew wanders around the convention center where the matches are being held, he talks to a number of people, trying to get some sort of a handle on the various martial arts and  &quot;artists.&quot;  This allows Donaldson to provide explanations of the different styles, which can be loosely characterized as &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft,&quot; as well as the various conflicts between different nations and their preferred styles.  The reader learns an awful lot about the martial arts and it's never presented in a didactic fashion.  Brew, at first, is very condescending in his attitude, but he gradually develops more and more respect and at the end of the book has become a student of Shotokan, under a Japanese master.<br /><br />The tournament is being put on under the auspices of an American karate master whose International Association of the Martial Arts is an attempt to bridge some of the gaps between the different styles, etc.  At the tournament, a set of &quot;chops&quot; or ivory tablets with the stances of Wing Chun, a traditionally Chinese martial art, are being displayed.  They are presently in the hands of the Japanese Shotokan master, which has lead to more bad blood between the various schools.  When a murder occurs, Brew suspects that it has something to do with the chops, but he isn't sure just how or why.<br /><br />As I said, the martial arts stuff really drew me into the book.  There's a lot of information in the book, but it's never presented in a way that makes it difficult to understand or follow.  Once the action gets underway, there isn't as much focus on the wishy-washiness of Donaldson's protagonist.<br /><br />The fictional locales threw me for a bit, but then I started to think of Carner as a stand-in for Tucson, or perhaps Phoenix, and the book started to feel a bit more realistic.  It also might be a bit far-fetched to have a hero recovering from a gut-wound rebound after only three weeks and be as involved in as much physical activity as Brew is in the book--he gets a number of heavy-duty beatings in the course of events.<br /><br />Still, it was a very entertaining book, which has me interested enough in the characters that I'll go back and seek out the other books in this series.

Ever since Matt befriended Mick Ballou, the Irish gangster and bar owner, Mick's served as a bit of a homicidal sidekick, like Hawk or Bubba or Joe Pike, getting Matt out of otherwise impossible situations.  Happily, Mick is only a minor player in this new book, which showcases Matt and how he  comes to grips with aging, following the unexpected death of his ex-wife.  Matt is one PI who has slowed down and aged in a realistic fashion.  He and his new wife, Elaine, a former  prostitute, have a comfortable life of dining out and attending concerts and plays.  She has her antique shop to keep her busy and Matt has the occasional \\"favor\\" to keep him occupied, having surrendered his PI license.<br /><br />When Matt realizes that the husband and wife victims in a particularly horrifying burglary/murder spree were present at the same concert/dinner that he and Elaine had attended the night before, he's drawn to the case, even when, apparently, the criminals responsible are discovered dead, in an apparent murder- suicide.  The police are only too happy to file this one away, but Matt can't let go of it, perhaps motivated in part by some troubles that his younger son is facing in his rootless life, drifting from job to job.  TJ, the street kid/computer hacker that Matt befriended some books back, has a big role in the book, and Matt interacts with a number of policemen, one of whom becomes something of a friend by book's end, dropping in for coffee and offering to put in a good word if he should want to reapply for a PI's license.<br /><br />Hiding in the background and pulling the strings is a truly scary monster, an apparently self-professed psychiatrist whose motives for engineering the burglary and a subsequent series of murders is really sick.  Block alternates third-person chapters with Matt and his investigation with an occasional first-person chapter, written in italics, that presents the killer's point of view, and this is an effective technique for throwing us off the<br />scent of who the killer might be.  In fact, Matt jumps to a conclusion about that identity two-thirds of the way through that almost proves deadly and has the policeman whose trust he's slowly earned refusing to answer his phone calls.<br /><br />I was a great book and an intriguing mystery and wonderful to spend time again with old friends.  I hope the series keeps going, although there are signs here that maybe Matt's career as a detective is coming to an end.pter, written in italics, that presents the killer's point of view, and this is an effective technique for throwing us off the  scent of who the killer might be.

Hegwood is, as others have noted, trodding ground made familiar by James Lee Burke.  But this first Jack Delmas mystery has none of the magic of Burke.  The book reads a lot like it was written by someone who was just trying to hit all the notes, but not really playing a tune.  All the elements are there, but there isn't any magic, any fluency.  I stuck with it once I hit the 50-page mark, but felt I had to finish it--I wasn't really compelled to by the writing.  Unfortunately, I'd already purchased the second Delmas mystery, _Green-Eyed Hurricane_, before I started in on this one.  Maybe that one will be better.	2001-09-11

Did those people read the same book I did?  This wasn't as fast-moving and chockful of mayhem as some of the other books by Ketchum that I've read, but ultimately, it is just as horrifying, if not more so, because we've come to understand and sympathize with his characters, many of whom meet with violent ends.<br />You can't pick up a Jack Ketchum novel and expect light reading.  Ketchum specializes in realistic horror and he will not flinch or turn away or cop-out.  This doesn't always make his books very easy to read.  But if you know what you're getting into and are prepared to hold on for the ride, you'll be subjected to a level of horror that just does not exist elsewhere in the publishing world right now.  I'd liken the experience of a Ketchum novel to riding a rollercoaster--once you're strapped in and climbing that first hill, it's too late to do much but go along for the ride.<br />This is a good book--it is slow-moving to begin with, but there's a reason for that, as Ketchum develops and creates a cast of believable, realistic, human characters.  We see their motivations and their thoughts/feelings, which makes what happens later on that much more affecting.  Regardless of this slow start, I was held riveted to the book and could not stop reading until it was finished.  It isn't quite up there in the same league as _The Girl Next Door_ or _Stranglehold_, Ketchum's most appalling books, but it is certainly one of his best novels and deserves to be read.  Just be careful and know what it is you're getting yourself into.	2001-08-10

It must be nice to burst on the mystery scene and pick up awards right and left for your books, as Rick Riordan has done.  But he's very deserving, if his latest novel is any indication.  _The Devil Went Down to Austin_ is the first Riordan book I've read and it was a real stunner.  This was an excellent mystery, with an assured authorial voice behind it.  I want more.<br />Riordan's PI, Tres Navarre, somewhat reluctantly gets involved when his older brother, Garrett, becomes suspect number one in the murder of his old friend and business partner in a computer start-up, Jimmy Doebler.  Neither Jimmy or Garrett, both skilled programmers, has much in the way of business acumen, and it appears that perhaps there's a sinister scheme underway to undermine their product, a potentially lucrative security system, and get them to sell for peanuts.  Tres, sho normally works out of a home base in San Antonio, has been hired to teach a summer school course in British literature at the university, so it is his proximity, in part, which draws him into the investigation.  There are also unexplored feelings of guilt regarding his brother and an accident in the past which took Garrett's legs.<br />There are some excellent things here: very clear, vivid descriptions of scuba diving; a very frightening, psychopathic killer, whose true identity is continually misdirected; and family infighting among the Doebler clan.  Tres is a vivid creation, as are his brother, his old girlfriend, Maia Lee, and the local policeman, Victor Lopez.  I had a great time with this book and am eagerly looking forward to reading the others in this series.  Receives my strongest recommendation!	2001-08-06

I read a couple of books over the weekend and had a good time with both, but the real find, for me, was Jon Talton's _Concrete Desert_, the debut of his character David Mapstone.<br />Mapstone holds a PhD in history and is in-between academic jobs, working part-time as a deputy for the sheriff's  department in Phoenix.  His job is to pull old, unsolved cases from the files and see if he can't put together some new leads.  At the same time, he's approached by an old girlfriend, to pull some strings and see if he can find a lead on her missing sister.  When his search for the sister begins to entangle itself with a 40-year-old unsolved murder, which might have been the work of a serial killer called &quot;the Creeper,&quot; Mapstone begins to receive threats on his life.<br />Talton does a great job with setting here, bringing Phoenix and the 100+ degree summer heat to convincing life.  Also, the historical research that his detective must do adds a fascinating touch to the novel and allows for quite a bit of comparison between the old city and the new one, which is growing at the rate of an acre of desert being taken over by development every hour.  This historical digging into old cases is a neat idea for a fictional detective/mystery series and should lead to many more interesting future novels.<br />Talton also does a good job of creating some background characters, such as Mapstone's boss/mentor, Chief Deputy Mike Peralta, and a love interest, Lindsay Adams, who works in the records department.  Both are characters we want to know more about and will, I hope, feature in future David Mapstone mysteries.  A very promising debut!	2001-07-02

I read a review of this in _Booklist_ or _Library Journal_ or somewhere which suggested that the characters of Billy Bob Holland and David Robicheaux were becoming almost indistinguishable.  So I was very worried about how this book would read, since this is something I've noted before, particularly in the last Billy Bob book, _Heartwood_, which really did read like a retread of a Dave Robicheaux book (_Cadillac Jukebox_), with little but the names of characters changed.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.  Even though he's dealing with the same concerns that he deals with in other books, _Bitterroot_ is entirely new and different territory for James Lee Burke.<br />Perhaps it's because the setting has moved from Texas to Montana, also the setting for the Edgar-winning _Black Cherry Blues_ from his Robicheaux series.  But this doesn't read like a retread of the Robicheaux books.  It's got the same mix of dangerous, lowlife characters whom our protagonist can't seem to stop stirring up.  But the fresh locations help to revive and invigorate the proceedings.<br /> Billy Bob isn't just a mirror image of Dave Robicheaux--he's much more extreme than Dave.  His attraction to violence seems much more ingrained and difficult to overcome, and he spends quite a bit of his time in the book musing about this fact.  Sometimes, you just want to whack Billy Bob (or Dave, for that matter) on the head and tell him to stop messing around with the lowlifes, but he just can't seem to help it.  And, ultimately, this is what we read Burke for: the battle of good vs. evil.<br />Coming on the heels of _Purple Cane Road_, _Bitterroot_ suggests that Burke has found a second wind to his writing and I, for one, could not be more excited to see what's next.	2001-06-18

It's just that the two have very similar stories, revolving around the growing problem of &quot;K and R&quot; or kidnap and ransom in Latin American countries.  It also has the same sort of alternating storyline, with scenes set among the kidnappers and their victims as they move from one primitive camp to another, and scenes involving the people who are trying to negotiate the ransom.<br />The book has very strong, believable characters and a convincing legal plotline, with quite a bit of courtroom intrigue and so forth.  The story follows the efforts of young Nick Rey, a rising star at the law firm of Coolidge, Harding and Cash (&quot;Cool Cash&quot;) in Miami, to win the release of his father, Matthew, kidnapped while in Colombia to purchase a trio of fishing boats for his struggling company.  The FBI won't get involved because they suspect the elder Rey is a drug smuggler, the insurance company refuses to pay off on the K and R policy because it suspects an inside job, and Nick's own firm accuses his family of trying to defraud the insurance company with a false claim.  Nick must deal with all this, while at the same time making several trips to Colombia to arrange the ransom, and to Nicaraugua to confer with his father's partner, a seemingly shady character responsible for the suspicions of drug smuggling.  Nick has on his side Alex, a former member of the Colombian rebel force FARC, which is one of the largest kidnap for ransom operations in the world, and his ex-fiance Jenna, the only lawyer in town who'll still answer his calls, though she insists she's doing it for his father.<br />It all adds up to a wonderful page-turner of a book, an intelligent thriller that's all too rare in my recent experience.  I'll definitely be looking for more of Mr. Grippando's books.	2001-06-12

This just isn't a very good book.  Where's the mystery?!  As in the first book in this series, Hamilton has his detective hero back off, just when he should be throwing himself headlong into coming up with some sort of a resolution to his detecting.  Evil people get away with it.  Now, I know that this happens all the time in reality, but when I read a mystery, I read for the resolution, for the tying up of the frayed threads, for some sort of return to a balance between good and evil.<br />I enjoyed the first Alex McKnight book.  The Upper Peninsula setting is an original one, and Hamilton is great with descriptions and giving you a strong sense of place.  But it was the second book that really got me.  Here was a writer to challenge William Kent Krueger (an author who sets his mysteries in the northwoods of Minnesota).  I especially liked how Alex's seemingly-bumbling partner came through and proved himself to be the real detective of the two.  So I was waiting for book three with high hopes.<br />Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book.  As I said at the start of my review, there just isn't much of a mystery here, and once McKnight figures out there really isn't a good guy anywhere in the whole mess, he just throws in the towel and goes home!  The story is meandering and, ultimately, rather pointless.  Plus, the locale is moved largely to Detroit, so we miss out on the UP descriptions.  And Alex's partner, Leon, is laid up in bed with two broken ankles after falling off the roof while chipping ice, so he's hardly onstage at all--just a voice on the other end of the phone for a number of conversations.<br />This is a real disappointment and I can only hope that Mr. Hamilton will rebound from this with his next book.  Here's a hint: solve the darn mystery!	2001-06-05

It is extremely slow-moving, almost dull at times.  I guess it isn't all that easy to encapsulate events taking place over a period of 9 years into a page-turner.  This isn't the sort of serial killer book that a Thomas Harris or John Sandford might write.  It does have its strengths--the characterization of the protagonist, Boudreau, is very carefully developed.  The serial killer-snitch, Garrett Lockman is also well-developed and very scary.  But with all the elements for a scary, thrilling book, Thorp instead goes for a very slow-moving style.  And it is a rather choppy style, as well--I'd agree with the reviewer who says that half (a third) of the plot seems to be missing, with the reader left to fill in the blanks from rather sketchy summaries of what's going on.  This gets progressively worse as the book drags on, as the chapters go from weeks to months to years apart.  I'd have to give this a very mixed review--ultimately, I only finished it because I'd given so much time to reading it to the halfway mark.	2001-05-29

But I just couldn't get into Boston Teran's latest.  His characters are tragic and haunted by life.  They make grand speeches about how pointless everything is.  Dee Storey, the hellish monster/mother at the center of the story, should be much more frightening/horrifying than she is.  For whatever reason, the characters just lie there, flat on the page, never truly coming to life.  This could have been a great, great book, but just doesn't quite make it.	2001-05-22

I only just realized that I've read almost all of them.  He's writing the same sort of page-turner/thriller as someone like a James Patterson, but he's so much better at it.  He really does seem to be, in the truest sense of an overused phrase, getting better with each book, rather than worse.  And he really does have a talent for tightening the screws and upping the suspense with each twist and turn of the plot, a talent which is on ample display in his newest book.<br /> In this one, we've got a twisted computer hacker, code-named &quot;Phate&quot; (according to the book, real hackers use &quot;ph&quot; rather than &quot;f&quot;), who's using his skills to get close to people by cracking their computers and getting to know every detail of their lives.  Then, he uses this information to lure them to their deaths: the more difficult it is to reach someone, the better.  The police work out a prison release for another brilliant hacker, Wyatt Gillette, to help them catch Phate.  Gillette is a good guy who was apparently in the wrong place at the wrong time: the government decided to make an example of him for cracking an encryption code.  All he wants is to reconcile with his ex-wife, who he lost during the trial, and because he paid more attention to his hacking.  Computer terms and technical details play a big part in the story and Deaver does a pretty good job of explaining things and keeping the story moving, including a brief glossary of terms at the beginning.<br /> Sure, maybe there are some details which aren't a hundred percent accurate, but unless you're a die-hard computer-phile, it probably won't make that much of a difference.  This is a very swift-moving, suspenseful ride.  According to the blurbs, the book has already been optioned as a movie and it could be a good one in the right hands.  And it doesn't read just like a screenplay--I think it was a book first and foremost.  These are characters I'd like to see again.  Are there more Wyatt Gillette novels in store?

US	52969730	R2GR0P7KDGYJ4K	0963339745	713197310	The Girl Next Door	Books	5	66	70	N	N	Real-life horror, not for the faint-hearted.	I'm not sure I can really add much to the other comments here, some of which are really quite eloquent in their discussions of the book. I bought the old paperback copy of the book, way back, a horrendous thing with a skeleton in a cheerleader's costume on the cover--the art had absolutely nothing to do with the story inside, as I was to discover. This was not the first Ketchum I'd read--that honor went to _Off Season_, which, if you've not read it yet, you owe it to yourself to find immediately. No, I came to _The Girl Next Door_ after I'd read a few more Ketchum titles, and I was still totally unprepared.<br /><br />This is easily the most gripping, horrifying, impossible-to-stop-reading book I've ever had in my hands. At the end, I felt so dirty, so complicit in the experience of reading that I threw away the book. Now, that's not a comment on the book or the quality of Mr. Ketchum's writing. On second thought, maybe it is--I've never been in the hands of someone so brutally honest, so able to force me to endure such a horrifying experience as the story he chronicles. This is not a feel-good experience. This is not one of those books where good triumphs over evil. You should not read this book if you're looking for a reassuring, light, easy read.<br /><br />But if you're ready to look into the dark heart of human evil, this may be the book for you. It is truly a great book--an excellent novel with memorable characters and spot-on writing. But the story is not one you'll shake off easily. It really is something akin to driving slowly by the scene of an accident--you want to see what happened, while at the same time, you dread seeing what happened. If you feel up to the experience, give this one a try.	2001-04-18

Despite what one or two of the other reviewers has said, this is indeed a great novel.  It is not an easy novel to read, however, given the highly disturbing nature of the subject matter--child abuse--and the realistic way Ketchum portrays it.  It is also a novel in which good does not triumph over evil (that's not really much of a spoiler, by the way--this almost never happens in a Ketchum book), which might also limit your enjoyment.  It's not the book to choose if you want to curl up in front of the fireplace and enjoy a comforting, light, easy read.  But, if you're willing to confront some of the more disturbing aspects of the human condition and the flawed nature of some of our society's institutions which sometimes enable, rather than prevent, nasty things to happen, give this book a try.  It's second only to Ketchum's _The Girl Next Door_ in the level of nasty, disturbing, realistic horror that he's able to bring to his storytelling.	2001-04-18
US	52969730	R1XSE6MLSEY8CN	0316695262	851439685	Right As Rain: A Novel	Books	5	16	20	N	N	One of Pelecanos' Best Novels, and That's Saying a Lot!	Over the weekend, I read  George P. Pelecanos' latest, _Right as Rain_ and what a beautiful novel it was.  Actually, I've cruised through his entire output in the past 10 or so months, and this book ranks right up there with _The Sweet Forever_, still my favorite.<br /><br />I love the way he describes Washington, D.C. in these books.  I don't think I'd want to live there, but his characters obviously love the place and there are times when that affection almost overshadows the violent, seedy, downtrodden neighborhoods and lives described elsewhere.  I also love the way the same characters weave in and out of the books, and how you can chart the downfall of the city, from _The Big Blowdown_ onward.<br /><br />That said, this book doesn't feature any of the characters from previous books, although the main relationship, between Terry Quinn, a former policeman and currently a clerk in a used book/ record store, and Derek Strange, also a former policeman (though much longer ago) and current private detective, might remind readers of the friendship between Dmitri Karras and Marcus Clay, in _King Suckerman_ and _The Sweet Forever_.<br /><br />This is because Terry is white and Derek is black.  And this, along with a riveting mystery, is Pelecanos' main theme in the book: how are the races getting along?  Is it possible to cross the divide and be friends?  There are a lot of probing insights into this throughout the course of the book.<br /><br />Essentially, Strange is hired to look into the shooting of an off-duty policeman, Chris Wilson, by Quinn, some years before.  Although Quinn has been cleared of wrongdoing, there's still some question whether he was too quick to pull the trigger, simply because Wilson was black.  From there, the two men gradually develop a real friendship, as they delve into the case Wilson was working on, a case that eventually proves to involve drugs and gangs.<br />This is, simply put, great writing.  Elmore Leonard has nothing on Mr. Pelecanos when it comes to writing memorable dialogue.  And the racial issues at the emotional core of the novel really elevate it above the norm.  Since I've moved from an English professor to the librarian at a small junior college in southern Colorado, I've been adding his books to the collection and it's been gratifying to see them go out and to hear the positive comments.

The characters were just a bit too wild to really register.<br />Then, about the time the protagonist, Bill, realizes that he's starting to have unusual feelings (love, friendship) for Conrad the Wonder Dog, and Frost, the leader of a small freakshow he's hooked up with following a botched robbery, I realized that I was starting to feel all warm inside, too.<br />It takes a great writer to create a character like Bill--someone you'd normally cross the street to avoid--and make you care about what happens to him.  I know that other reviewers didn't feel the same way, but I was right there, rooting for the poor guy the whole way.<br />If anything, the downbeat, noirish finale, which I should have seen coming, came as a bit of a surprise, even though we've all seen this a thousand times before (think _Double Indemnity_ or _Body Heat_).<br />Heck, I would have been happy just following Bill's adventures with the freakshow for a few more hundred pages.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly, though it's obviously not for all tastes.	2001-01-29

It isn't a crazy mix of weird characters and off-beat situations.  And it's stronger because of it.  Here, Lansdale calms things down and winds up with a serious, penetrating look at the casual racism of the early 20th century, combined with the everyday, ordinary lives of his characters, all set against a backdrop of a series of horrific murders.<br />Harry Crane, the book's protagonist, is 12 years old and straining to be accepted as a man.  He and his younger sister Tom stumble across the body of a murdered black woman one night, while trying to outrun the &quot;Goat Man,&quot; a figure of local legend.  Harry's father is the town constable, as well as part-time barber and farmer, and is reluctantly drawn into an investigation of the murder, in a time before forensic science and behavioral profiling.  The fact that the victim is a black woman has most of the locals wishing he'd just let things be, but the elder Crane continues to investigate.<br />Over the course of a story told in what I have to believe is a realistic regional dialect, Harry fills us in on what life was like during the time: it was the Depression in East Texas, and many were going West, to outrun the Dust Bowl conditions.  Life is hard for the Crane family, but Harry and his sister are never in need, never really aware of the things they're missing.  They're concerned with living their lives, which are for the most part happy.  Only, every now and then, another body is found.<br />Part of the magic of the book is the way Lansdale effortlessly slips inside the persona of Harry, telling the story from a viewpoint on the cusp of adolescence.  Also, the subtle, and not-so-sutle ways in which racial issues are brought up and dealt with make this a very memorable tale.  Comparisons to _To Kill a Mockingbird_ are fair, but ultimately, this book is a bit too racy, a bit too concerned with the gruesome details of the killings, to really be suitable reading for any but a more mature audience.  Also, the &quot;mystery&quot; really isn't all that mysterious, as, after a certain point, there are really only a couple of possible suspects left (though, it was ultimately a surprise to me who the culprit was).  Not quite a 5-star book; I'd give it 4 1/2., to really be suitable reading for any but a more mature audience.

The book mixes real history and  characters with fictional characters to great effect, something along the  lines of what Max Allan Collins does in his Nate Heller mysteries.  Set in  the post-WWII years in the corrupt town of Hot Springs, Arkansas, Hunter  succeeds in creating a real page-turner, as we follow the adventures of  Earl Swagger, a depressed war hero with something of a death wish, as he  puts together a group of young lawmen to weed out the corruption.<br />The  group is something like the Untouchables--young, single men gathered from  police forces around the country so that they will not be compromised by  local connections.  The scenes of the group's training are among the best  in the book, along with the action sequences wherein they bring down a  number of casinos.<br />This isn't a perfect book by any means: Hunter  really strains sometimes to tell his story and there are a lot of very  awkward sentence constructions.  He isn't entirely successful in bringing  the historical characters--Bugsy Siegel, Virginia Hill, etc.--to real,  believable life.  And, as in the Bob Lee Swagger books, there's a bit too  much attention to the guns and the gunplay for any but the  firearms-obsessed, which Hunter appears to be.<br />Still, this was a very  fast-moving and enjoyable book and I'd recommend it.	2000-08-22

Robinson's story is that there's another, secret, competing race of humans that live among us and are healthier, more peaceful, stronger, etc.  When his characters accidentally stumble onto this fact, it  sets in motion a chain of events that start off exciting, but gradually  become very repetitive, with the book ultimately falling apart, due to one  coincidence too many (I don't want to give too much away here and risk  ruining the book for you).

It's an excellent tale of a blocked writer (see Donald Westlake's _The Hook_) who goes back to his boyhood hometown to look into the mystery surrounding the death of a girl, whose body he discovered  floating in the Hudson River.  He intends to write the story of what he  discovers and he ultimately discovers the secret.  Along the way, we're  treated to a slowly unfolding, very gripping story, including the tragic  figure of a wild fan who first intrigues, then scares our protagonist.  Carroll has a gift for writing some of the most poignant characters and  scenes--things that really get under your skin and drag you in feet-first.  I'm thinking about one memorable scene in which three of our main  characters are sitting on the porch, sharing jokes and stories, and the  writer-protagonist says something along the lines of &quot;I'm very glad I  have both of you in my life.&quot;  I'm very glad there's an author like  Jonathan Carroll in mine (too cheesy?).	2000-04-24

Westlake uses what must, by now, be a voluminous knowledge of the book publishing industry to put together an ingenious set up: best-selling author Bryce Proctorr, in the midst of a  nasty divorce, has hit a blank wall creatively and the pressure is on,  since his new book is months overdue.<br />Proctorr runs into an old friend,  writer Wayne Prentice, at the library one day and hears Wayne's tale of  woe: in the new publishing environment, the computer and sales figures rule  everything--a midlist author can't hope to make it anymore if his sales  continue to decline.  Eventually, a new book by that author, no matter how  talented, will meet with indifference by a publisher.  To combat this,  Prentice has been  writing books under a pseudonym, &quot;Tim Fleet,&quot;  but now Fleet's sales figures have become caught in that same downward  spiral.<br /><br />Proctorr, whose deadline is looming, hatches a plan: he will  take Prentice's new book, which will never find a willing publisher, make  minor changes to names and incidents, and hand it in as his own, splitting  the $500,000 advance.  There's only one condition: Wayne must kill  Proctorr's ex-wife, Lucie.<br /><br />Events proceed from there and nothing works  out quite the way we might expect.  Along the way, there's a lot of  rumination about the state of  publishing and writing today--if you're an  aspiring writer, this might not be the best book to read (it doesn't  exactly paint a rosy picture of your chances of being published).  And it  all moves relentlessly to an extremely chilling and understated conclusion.<br />Westlake is an excellent writer and he continues to turn out amazing  work.  This book is highly recommended!	2000-04-20

Other reviewers have pointed out the similarities between this book's storyline and such classics as _It_ and _Swan Song_ (maybe Dan Simmons'  _Summer of Night_?).  But it's because of these similarities that I think  the book didn't work for me.<br />For one thing, Clegg's characters are not  people I could connect with or relate to.  I never really cared what  happened to these people, and that was a big failure.  In the scenes set in  the town's past, he ought to have  done more to create convincing,  compassionate portraits of these people if he wanted us to care about them  in the later scenes.<br />For another thing, the whole &quot;epic&quot; story  really felt a bit rushed as I read it, with whole scenes and situations  alluded to or referred to in passing, but never fleshed out.  I thought I  was going to go crazy with the delay of the &quot;Terrible Thing&quot; that  the survivors had done.  It's continually referred to throughout the book,  but only in the last 30 or so pages do we find out what it is (and, another  question, how could Than have taken part in this?).<br />This really wasn't  such an epic horror story, after all.  Certainly not on the scale of _It_  or _Swan Song_.  This is not a book that I can see myself wanting to come  back to and read again, the way I've reread these others.  All in all, I'd  have to say it was a near miss.	2000-04-03

The day my order arrived in the mail, I sat down to start reading and I did not get up until the book was done.  Peter Watts does a great job here of setting up a believable group of misfits,  biologically enhanced so they can survive underwater and at great depths.  Through some trial-and-error, it is discovered that only those who have  some sort of mental imbalance can survive in such a hostile atmosphere.  Coupled with the marvelous descriptions of the weird and grotesque life  forms which thrive in the deep, this novel really creates a grim,  believable portrait of the world.  About the only drawback I noted was the  conclusion, which, ironically, one of the other reviewers holds up as the  book's high point.  I'm looking forward to more thoughtful science fiction  from Mr. Watts.	2000-03-28

The boy  apparently was an eyewitness to the murder of his grandparents many years  before by a man Hannah's father was prosecuting for embezzlement.<br />The FBI  is aware of her circumstances and an especially devious agent-in-charge  sets up an elaborate sting, aimed at the vicious mob killer, Hal Bonner, an  odd, inhuman, almost robotic man, with a grisly trademark to his slayings.  The agent in charge of the investigation into the death of Hannah's father  years before, Frank Sheffield, shows up again and starts to fall in love  with Hannah.<br />Just based on this brief summary, you'd be right in thinking  this is a pretty convoluted plot for a thriller, but Hall makes it work.  His characters are real, believable human beings and they're often put in  situations of extreme jeopardy.  Not all will survive.  It is also to  Hall's credit that he almost manages the feat of making us care about the  inhuman Hal, who becomes involved in a love affair of his own during the  course of the story.<br />This is an excellent, fast-moving thriller, and  highly recommended.	2000-03-23

The premise of Peter Watts' debut is that a multinational company is seeking personnel for its deepsea geothermal stations, located near thermal vents.  Through trial and error, they find that only psychotic, damaged, abused  people can withstand the pressures of working in such an environment, some  of them actually growing to like being there.<br />The lead character, Lenie  Clarke, is an adult survivor of abuse and one of the earliest success  stories.  She's grown to be comfortable with the bioengineering and  implants which are necessary for anyone to survive at 3000 feet down.  She's become the unacknowledged leader at Beebe station on the Juan de Fuca  rift.  Also stationed at Beebe are a variety of pedophiles, manic  depressives, and those who've volunteered to avoid a prison sentence.<br />The  undersea world is vividly imagined, complete with horrific, overgrown  fish-monsters who make periodic appearances and attacks.  Some of the crew  begin to &quot;native,&quot; preferring the cold, dark sea to the  oppressive interior of the station.  One, pedophile Gerald Fischer,  actually begins to devolve into something not entirely human anymore, in a  very emotional, tragic development.<br />About the only flaw the story had was  the rushed, hurried ending, with a threat to the existence of life as we  know it suddenly thrust into the midst of an otherwise very grim, yet  satisfying story.  The book might have used another hundred pages or so to  adequately contain all the ideas on display.  Despite this, I'd still  recommend the book very highly.	2000-02-07

This is an interesting deviation from the sorts of material--police procedurals,  serial killers, intricate plots, etc.--that Michael Connelly usually  presents in his books.  Ultimately, though, it just wasn't as good.<br />Maybe  part of the problem is that I've just come from a year wherein I read the  complete Richard Stark (Donald Westlake) Parker series, about an amoral  thief and his carefully organized heists.  It's hard to measure up to that  standard.<br />Cassie Black, the protagonist in _Void Moon_, is an  ex-convict who once specialized in burglarizing the casino/hotel rooms of  high rollers, with her lover, Max.  Some years ago, the two of them ran  into some misfortune and, due to the Byzantine laws in effect in Las Vegas,  Cassie was imprisoned for manslaughter in Max's death, even though she was  waiting for him in a casino lobby at the time.  Now out on parole and  working in a Porsche dealership (a pretty comfortable, high-profile gig for  an ex-con), she's inexplicably drawn back to attempt one more job, in the  same casino where things went so wrong.<br />In the course of the job, she  crosses paths with private detective and psychopathic casino dirtywork man,  Jack Karch, the son of a deceased magician of some renown.  Karch is an  effective creation, a scarily-convincing bad guy, who very quickly picks up  Cassie's trail in an effort to retrieve the money she's stolen.<br />On the  whole, though, this wasn't as ingenious a plot as I'm used to with Michael  Connelly.  I guess I've come to expect more twists and turns, a more  carefully, deviously plotted story.  This is a good book, don't  misunderstand me, but I just don't feel that it lives up to some of his  previous novels.	2000-02-01

Though he no longer holds a license (because of a sequence of events which are gradually filled in during the course of the book), Harding still does some occasional work for his friend Donnie, an old  friend from his Chicago neighborhood who now works in a corporate security  office.<br /><br />As the book opens, Harding is tracking Dr. Stephen  Rosenberg,  a plastic surgeon, who has some decidedly unsavory sexual<br />practices and preys on the nurses and students at the University of  Chicago hospital.  Rosenberg's wife, Elenya, is getting tired of the  physical abuse she must sustain at her husband's hands and is looking for a  way to divorce him.<br /><br />This decidedly simple premise sets in motion a  very complicated  chain of events and gruesome murders, which, ultimately,  I don't  think, was ever satisfactorily solved.  When I came to the end,  I  still had a lot of unanswered questions.<br /><br />Still, the book was very  good in its depiction of winter in Chicago;  of the post-graduate  hangers-on around campus, including Harding's  friend, Boone; and of the  unusual relationship Harding has with  his former girlfriend, Allison, a  woman into Goth and kick-boxing,  and who now appearsto be a lesbian.  Harding is a memorable  creation--a very well-educated, moral, romantic  detective who loves horror movies.  I wouldn't mind spending more time with  him, though I hope subsequent books aren't as complicated and have a  stronger resolution.<br /><br />Those who dislike a very dark, grim, at times  even grotesque read, will be turned off by this book.	2000-02-01

This was the first book of Mr. Little's I've read, though I've been buying most of his books as they come out (they're waiting in a stack).  I enjoyed the book, which had an interesting idea--namely that the House served as a gate to keep the two sides of reality separate from each other.  A very  similar idea to that which drives the classic _The House on the Borderland_  by William Hope Hodgson.<br />The book was a quick, easy read, but it could  have been more.  It wasn't particularly horrific and the plot that Mr.  Little has constructed here could use more development--this is the sort of  story that drives epic-length novels, not 300-some pages.

But  there is also much to despair about in the book, including the entire final  portion of the book, which is so ludicrous, so ridiculously over the top,  that it is hard to imagine what Harris was thinking as he wrote it.  I've  read reviews that call it &quot;black comedy,&quot; but if it is, I don't  see it.<br /> This took eleven years?!  I'd be embarrassed to have this work  go out with my name on it. I'd be embarrassed to be the publisher connected  with it.  This is a case where raw greed got in the way of such simple  things as basic proofreading and editing and should provide some proof that  there is no one who is such a great writer that his/her work could not use  some editing.<br /> How this could possibly be adapted into a film is beyond  me.	1999-06-24
US	52969730	RVDRNRH4AOAEH	0316691097	882170667	The Sweet Forever	Books	5	17	18	N	N	This is one heck of a beautiful book--A real stunner!	If you haven't read George P. Pelecanos, you're missing one hell of an experience!  This is easily his best book and that's saying alot, since he's yet to make a misstep with any of his crime/detective novels.<br /> _The  Sweet Forever_ is a beautifully- done book (one of the jacket blurbs likens  it to a crime-thriller version of _Bonfire of the Vanities_, a particularly  apt comparison, I think).  It is the second book to feature the team of  Dimitri Karras/Marcus Clay (first introduced in _King Suckerman_), two old  friends now running a chain of D.C.-based record stores.<br />  The book is  set in 1986, when cocaine was at its peak of popularity and just before the  advent of crack.  The streets of Washington D. C. are growing ever more  dangerous and the town continues to dwindle and wither away, ignored by a  corrupt, drug-using mayor and his regime.<br /> Dimitri and Marcus run afoul  of a gang of cocaine runners in the neighborhood of Marcus' new  store,located  in a particularly run-down part of the city.  He's trying to  put something back into the community, so he's willing to put up with slow  sales.  But when the gang members start pushing around young kids in the  area, Marcus gets involved, almost against his better judgement.<br /> One of  the neat things about the book is that Dimitri himself is hooked on cocaine  and his habit is dragging him down further and further, only he himself is  not aware of this yet.  The novel gets only that much more morally complex  when one of the two leads is involved, however slightly, in the very drug  trade that is ruining the city and which the characters must battle  with.<br /> There are so many great scenes here and great characters.  Marcus  has a huge heart and is willing to go out on the line for people that some  might ignore or turn their backs on.  Add in a corrupt cop whose conscience  keeps digging at him and  a drug runner who isn't sure about what he's  doing, and you've got one memorable mixture.<br /> I'm a sucker for emotional  movies, I'll admit.  Play my heartstrings and I get a lump in my throat  just like that.  But I very seldom, if ever, have the same response to the  written word.  When reading this book, however, I had more  &quot;throat-lump&quot; moments than I could keep track of.  This is very  highly recommended and a perfect example of how the lowly &quot;crime  thriller&quot; can operate far outside the boundaries of its genre.

US	52969730	R2XL5S64ATFWP7	0312192436	499280276	Body Language	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Top-notch new book signals a different direction for Hall.	Last night, I finished James W. Hall's latest novel, _Body Language_, which is something of a departure for him.  Hall has an ongoing series featuring the character Thorn, a generally easygoing type, who spends his  days tying sought-after flies for fishermen and is often dragged into all  manner of violent and complicated situations involving an assortment of his  old friends and lovers.  The Thorn books are great and highly  recommended.<br /> In _Body Language_, Hall introduces a new character,  Alexandra Collins, who is a photo technician with the Miami police  department, spending her nightly shifts photographing murder scenes and  apparently paying penance for a violent incident in her own past (which  opens the book, by the way, so it's not much of a  spoiler).  This same  incident appears to be coming back to haunt her, in the form of a series of  rape- murders being committed by the &quot;Bloody Rapist.&quot;<br /> Most  writers would be happy with this as the complete plot for a novel, but Hall  only uses this as a starting point, adding a whole variety of other  criminal activity into the mix.  The whole is at times gruesome, but then  the mood will quickly change to black comedy or to a very moving, emotional  moment.  Sure, there are some rough edges, particularly noticeable during  the book's conclusion, but the whole is so well-written and comes off as a  sort of mixture of Carl Hiaasen and Elmore Leonard's Florida-based crime  stories.<br /> Without my really realizing it, Hall has snuck in and become  one of the few authors whose work I will snap up without reservation.  The  last Thorn novel, _Red Sky at Night_, made my ten-best list for 1998, and I  would place _Body Language_ in my early forecast for best books of this  year.  For anyone who enjoys Carl Hiaasen or the work of Randy Wayne White,  James W. Hall is another name in the pantheon of Florida-based crime  writers to be added to your list.	1999-01-20

This is actually the second book in a projected trilogy, but one of the neat things Mr. Koontz does here is that he writes it in such a way that it stands alone.  Yet, if you've had the chance to read the first installment,  _Fear Nothing_, this only enhances the experience further.<br />Chris Snow,  the protagonist, is limited to a night-time existence by the presence of a  gene for XP, a condition that makes exposure to sunlight potentially  lethal.  This hasn't limited him or his amazingly positive outlook on life  any.  He has a collection of friends that anyone would be proud to  have.<br />In _Seize the Night_, we get a chance to explore more deeply into  the abandoned army base at Fort Wyvern, wherein all manner of sinister,  secret government projects were apparently underway, with some suggestion  that they haven't all been abandoned.  Wyvern is a great creation--an eerie  place haunted by the genetically altered results of an experiment gone  wrong.<br /> The entire town of Moonlight Bay is a memorable setting for  these stories--government men and their local toadies have clamped down on  all attempts to get the story out to the world at large.  Indeed, it  sometimes seems like armageddon may have been loosed upon the world from  the seemingly peaceful area.<br />The book is very highly recommended.  If you  have the chance, by all means read _Fear Nothing_ first, however.	1999-01-11

James Blaylock really is a great writer of fantasy, but it's a peculiarly realistic sort of fantasy.  Not for him the realms of wizards and elves of traditional &quot;fantasy.&quot;  Instead, he's writing a sort of  contemporary fantasy wherein elements of ghost stories and suchlike enter  into the everyday lives of his characters.<br />_Winter Tides_ is something of  a change for Blaylock, at least in my reading of him.  Most of his books  that I've read have been peopled by quirky, gently humorous characters,  generally allied against some sort of dark force which is ultimately  clueless.  In this novel, the villain is a very frightening person who  graduates from mild pranks to outright murder in a realistic fashion.  It's  difficult to point out exactly when he goes over the edge.  The effect is  to make the outcome of events much less predictable and thus much more  serious for the ragtag bunch of characters who represent the  &quot;good.&quot;<br />Very highly recommended.	1999-01-07

This is the second in the Lincoln Rhyme series.  Again, it is a very fast-paced book and absorbing, but not a contender for any sort of longevity.<br />  The relationship between Rhyme and his protege Amelia Sachs  continues to develop and Rhyme has to fight off not one, but two amorous  women in the course of the novel.  Wish-fulfillment on the part of his  creator?<br />  The search for the killer, a professional contract killer, is  just as breathless as the search for the serial kidnapper/murderer in the  previous book, though it is a bit more believable this time to have  everything compressed into a 48-hour time period, as the killer scrambles  to get rid of a trio of witnesses before they can testify before a grand  jury.<br /> Couple this with a neat twist at the end which, for once,  actually makes sense and causes one to reconsider what has gone before, and  this adds up to an enjoyable excursion through a &quot;forensic  procedural&quot; (though, compared to Patricia Cornwell and some of the  authors mining this subfield, Deaver might be more &quot;forensic  procedural- lite&quot;).<br /> It's also a better book than the first one and  shows that there's still plenty of room for the continued  development of  the character of Lincoln Rhyme.	1998-12-06

Not the sort of book I usually read, but I was acting on a friend's recommendation.  I'm glad I did!  This was a very enjoyable book, filled with careful attention to detail and a great, climactic turn of events.  Bob Lee Swagger is a memorable fictional creation and interesting enough  that I may just have to go on to read his other adventures (_Black Light_  and _Time to Hunt_).

This book is well worth the time and trouble that it might take to track it down.  John Farris is one of the few authors in the horror genre who continually tries new things and can be counted on to deliver from one book  to the next.<br />In _Wildwood_, he offers a truly involving mixture of  fantasy (at times, this reminded me strongly of Robert Holdstock's _Mythago  Wood_) and frightening, cosmic horror.  In a relatively short time, Mr.  Farris has become one of my favorite authors and I haven't been  disappointed yet in any of the books I've read by him, many of which have  involved some rather lengthy searching through the musty, dim stacks of  used bookstores.  Highly recommended!	1998-11-19

I'll admit that I'm only an infrequent reader of Mr. Morrell's works, but what I have read, I've almost always enjoyed.  Not so with this new novel.<br />What begins as another of his routine thrillers, with a seemingly  superhuman villain killing all that the hero holds dear, ends about  half-way through and turns into -- I don't know what.  The book jacket  describes it as a cross between _Vertigo_ and _Basic Instinct_, but it was  just garbage.  A supernatural explanation would have been better than what  we eventually got by way of resolution.  The book reads like an aborted  screenplay for a really bad movie.  Why Morrell felt the necessity to  dovetail these two unrelated plots together is beyond me.  It's almost as  if he had enough material for two novellas and said &quot;Maybe my readers  will buy this, they're stupid!&quot;  The book is so disappointing, I  think, because it hinted at and promised so much more.  Avoid this at all  costs!	1998-11-02

Only recently have I discovered the work of this talented author.  Very  few writers are able to achieve the same level of suspense and terror.  Farris has the ability to write a horror story that is both a page-turner  and will leave you thinking about his characters and themes.<br />_Sacrifice_  is only the fourth book of his that I've read, but it grabbed me in a way  similar to _All Heads Turn as the Hunt Goes By_, except that, here, he's  using ancient Mayan rites rather than the voodoo of the previous  novel.<br />Greg Walker appears to be the perfect husband and father.  That  is, until his abnormally quick recovery from a gunshot wound to the head.  A seemingly crazy woman arrives from Canada, claiming to be his wife in a  former life, but if her dates are correct, Greg would have to be more than  70 years old!  The story very gradually unfolds and a race against time is  the ultimate result.<br />A great combination of ancient history (Farris  obviously did his homework on this one), intriguing, realistic characters,  and a story that is both horrifying, yet ultimately sad and heart-breaking  make this one a real standout.  Strongly recommended.	1998-10-26

For about the first half, I was under the spell that Stephen King cast in  his new book, _Bag of Bones_.  It was wonderful, enthralling, etc., etc.,  what so few of his recent books have been.  I had great hopes for the book,  which I'd seen described as &quot;his best novel ever.&quot;<br />Do I agree  with that evaluation?  No.  See _The Shining_ for the book that we will  remember Mr. King for.  _Bag of Bones_ falls apart around the midpoint, as  do so many of his novels (for me, the magic started to disappear around the  time of _Pet Sematary_, but I continue to read, and hope, that it will  someday return).  Will my comments persuade or dissuade you from reading  the book?  Unlikely.  Still, I was hoping for more.  Keep working, Mr.  King.	1998-10-02

I saved the book  for a rainy day and came to it wanting to savor every word.  Unfortunately,  this is about as bad a book as I've read.  The situations are very  unrealistic, straight out of cliffhanger, pulp fiction.  The characters  never seem like real people, but more stock stereotypes.  I kept wondering  why I was reading it, but I determined to follow through to the very end.  It never got any better.  Definitely not recommended.	1998-09-14

I only discovered George Turner quite recently, after reading a review of  one of his books in Locus.  Sadly, he's now passed away, but the books he  left before his death are some of the most challenging and scintillating  science fiction I've read recently.<br />In _Vaneglory_, which is the second  book in a loose &quot;Ethical Culture&quot; trilogy (after _Beloved Son_),  Turner continues his expose of the new society which has arisen in the wake  of the collapse of our present society, a collapse which involved limited  nuclear war, famine, ecological failure, etc.  Turner is very pessimistic  about humankind and our possibilities for learning from past mistakes.  The  new culture is expressly based on attempting to keep us from falling into  the same traps, while the society's leaders continue to use any and all  dirty tricks they can to keep and consolidate their power.<br />45 years after  the end, Will Santley and Donald Baird are awakened from cryogenic  hibernation at the Gangoil facility, an advanced Australian biological  research station.  The two men are &quot;Gone Timers,&quot; representatives  of a violent past who are accorded little or no status in the new society.  When it comes out that there may be a race of immortal human mutations  living among us, the race is on to capture and sequester an actual  representative, a race that ranges from Melbourne Town to the ruins of  Glasgow, Scotland.<br />Turner never lets the book lag and continues to pile  on idea after idea.  This is a great combination of adventure and  philosophy, with a heart-rending conclusion.  Highly recommended (though  you should read _Beloved Son_ first!).	1998-09-13

Not much more I can say, since it's been awhile since I read it, but this is a truly memorable novel.  Blaylock is at his best when he tones down the quirkiness of his characters and presents his unique brand of fantasy in a more down-to-earth setting.  This novel reminded me of some of the best work of Tim Powers, a friend of Blaylock's, and someone who is mining this same vein in his writing.  Highly recommended!	1998-07-06

After his amazing first novel, _A Drink Before the War_, _Darkness, Take My Hand_ only serves to solidify his ascendancy to the upper ranks of active detective novelists.<br />This is a great book, a convincing exploration of how &quot;the sins of the fathers&quot; are visited upon the sons (and daughters).  Throw in a serial killer or two (or three), a dangerous neighborhood watch group, and some of the most atmospheric descriptions of setting I've read, and this novel is a must-read, even if you're a bit squeamish (and heaven knows, there's much to be squeamish about in this book).  Lehane does a marvelous job of showing the lingering effects of violence and how they affect (and infect) succeeding generations.  Right now, he's near the top of my &quot;must-read&quot; list, with such writers as Les Roberts and James Lee Burke.	1998-07-06

Rozan's book _China Trade_ introduces the private investigative team of Lydia Chin and Bill Smith, two of the more realistically-drawn and memorable characters in a contemporary private eye series.  Told from the viewpoint of Chin, Rozan does a great job of reflecting Lydia's cultural background, which plays an important role in the mystery surrounding a stolen lot of export porcelain.  Rozan's descriptions of Chinatown and the New York City neighborhoods where the investigation takes place are quite realistic and easily visualized.  Couple this with a very complicated plot, full of twists and turns, and the mix adds up to a very memorable first novel.  I'll be looking for further volumes in this series.	1998-07-06

At the time, it just didn't click for me (maybe it was my mood--who knows?).  When I finally came back to it last week (after exposure to a couple of other Blaylock novels), I was immediately caught-up in the magic.<br />Quirky, at times almost insane, characters band together to battle an evil man who is intent on hording the 30 pieces of silver paid to Judas to betray Christ.  When the coins are all together in one place, the person who owns them will wield untold power.  In the midst of trying to start a bed and breakfast inn, the hero, Andrew Vanbergen, realizes that he has come into ownership of the last coin of the title and engages in a battle of wits with the mysterious Pennyman, who owns the other 29.<br />James P. Blaylock, along with his friend Tim Powers, is a master of this sort of thing, drawing together a wide array of seemingly-unconnected incidents and historical allusions into a conspiracy that makes a lot of sense.  Coupled with quirky characters and humourous incidents, this is a marvelous, memorable novel.	1998-06-30

It's not a classic by any means, but this is a lean, mean novel, which reminded me again why I was attracted to Herbert's novels in the first place.  More than half of the book consists of extended chase scenes, with economical descriptions and well-defined characters. Plenty of twists and turns in a plot reminiscent of the film _The Omega Man_ (adapted from Richard Matheson's _I Am Legend_).  Definitely recommended for fans of James Herbert's earlier novels (like _The Rats_ and _The Fog_).	1998-06-30

I can remember the first time I picked up a volume in Clive Barker's _Books of Blood_ series of short story collections.  Wow! I thought, this guy can write!  When _The Damnation Game_ was released, I was in heaven.  Then, somewhere around page 100 of _Weaveworld_, I got a bit bogged-down and never finished the book.  Similar experiences awaited me with _The Great and Secret Show_, _Imagica_, and _Everville_.  Now, at last, I've come to the end of another Barker novel.<br />_Galilee_ is a real page-turner, a compulsively readable novel that grabbed me and didn't let go, in a way that some of Barker's other books haven't.  This is a strange mix of horror and romance, the &quot;romance&quot; of a Nathaniel Hawthorne, rather than a Danielle Steel.<br />The tale of the Geary and Barbarossa clans, two powerful, interlocked families, kept me hooked, with just the right number of allusions and hints to the real connections between them to keep me reading.  Occasionally, the device of having the narrator recount what is happening now, around him, in the Barbarossa home, L'Enfant, got a bit too much, in that it delayed my return to the suspense of what was happening with the Gearys.  Also, a number of unresolved plotlines are left hanging at the end, though it doesn't seem that there's enough story left to warrant a sequel.  Finally, I was amazed at the frequency of the typographical errors present in the text--now that Barker has ascended to the heights, doesn't anyone edit his manuscripts anymore?<br />Nevertheless, I'd give the book a fairly strong recommendation.  Perfect summer reading.	1998-06-17

Mary Doria Russell has created some of the most well-rounded, realistic characters that I've ever seen in this novel.  Her protagonist, Father Emilio Sandoz, especially stands out.  I have to admit to a certain fondness for this sort of religiously-themed novel--Graham Greene is perhaps my favorite author--and I loved the moral questions/problems/debates, etc., that Russell deals with in the book.  It is often quite brutal and gruesome, but then life is like that.  A film I saw once, called _Black Robe_, had a similar feel, with Jesuit missionaries working (and subject to brutality/misunderstandings) among Indian tribes in early America/Canada.  This is a book that truly deserves all the superlatives which have been written about it.  A perfect introduction to science fiction for those who might not normally read in the genre (and I'm not going to nit-pick the scientific details--they just didn't matter that much in the face of the truly human characters Russell presents us).

Michael Connelly's latest thriller is a much more believable work than his previous stand-alone, _The Poet_.  In this one, his protagonist is Terrell McCaleb, FBI retireee and recipient of a recent heart transplant.  When the sister of his organ's donor comes to ask him to get involved in the investigation, McCaleb feels a very personal connection to the case, which draws him in.<br />Connelly does a great job with the inter-departmental rivalries involved in the case and the reluctance of both police and sheriff's departments to have McCaleb get involved.  Also quite real are the insights into McCaleb's recuperation, when a temperature of even 1 or 2 degrees above normal suddenly becomes a matter of concern.<br />What McCaleb eventually discovers in his investigation is a real shock, one which Mr. Connelly keeps hidden pretty well until the climactic moment.  My only real problem with the book was the swift and relatively easy capture of his quarry towards the end.  A strong recommendation!	1998-05-27

She's battled with alcoholism in the past and has always had a tendency to come off as a bit cold and unfriendly.  In the new book, Anna shows signs of coming out of her shell and warming up a bit.<br />  When a friend of hers is injured in a caving accident in New Mexico's Lechuguilla Cavern, a little-explored network of caverns adjacent to Carlsbad, Anna, already on the scene as an information officer, is persuaded to don caving gear and make her way to the scene.  Once there, she is confronted with a semi-delirious friend who suggests that the accident may not have been so accidental, prompting Anna to begin her own informal investigation, which very quickly becomes more serious, following a cave-in and rock slide that injures the rescuers and kills Anna's friend.<br />  The real strength of this novel lies in Barr's vivid descriptions of claustrophobic spaces and underground wonders.  Anna is no caver, though she does grow to have a certain appreciation for the subterranean.  The writing does a great job of capturing her fear and uncertainty as she first enters the cavern, on her way to comfort her friend.  Barr also does a memorable job of describing her growing comfort with the cave during a return visit later in the novel.<br />  Beyond this, the novel effectively shows Anna Pigeon growing and maturing as a character.  Anna has always been very complex, some might even say unlikeable.  In this book, she comes more into her own, as she overcomes her own fears to enter the cave for the first time, and later, as she pursues her investigation at the risk of her own safety.<br />  It's a great pleasure to sit down with each book in this series, just to see what Barr will come up with next for her character, although the novelty of her national park settings may be wearing off somewhat.  Toward the end, Anna even seems to be reconsidering her dedication to her park ranger's job.<br />  The only frustration is having to wait for the next book to see what will happen!  Very strongly recommended--if you have the chance, this is definitely a series to be read in order.edication to her park ranger's job.<br />  The only frustration is having to wait for the next book to see what will happen!

Gary Phillips' _Violent Spring_ introduces readers to his detective, Ivan Monk, a great new hardboiled private eye for the 90s.<br />Monk is hired by two seemingly disparate groups, a Korean Merchants' group and SOMA, Save Our Material Assets, a group interested in rebuilding downtown LA, following the riots of 1992, to look into the murder of a Korean businessman, whose body is uncovered during a ground-breaking ceremony.  Monk gets involved in a politically-charged, racially diverse investigation that threatens to spark more violence, the closer he gets to the truth.<br />I'll be honest--this book did take a while to get going.  The first hundred or so pages didn't really grab me.  But as I stuck with it, Monk and his group of friends and relatives really began to grow on me, enough so that I immediately started into Phillips' second book in this series, _Perdition USA_.  Monk is very reminiscent of Walter Moseley's Easy Rawlins and part of a growing renaissance of African-American detectives in the 90s (see also Gar Anthony Haywood and Robert Greer, among others).<br />Based on what I've read, Phillips and Ivan have a great career ahead of them.	1998-04-02

Michael Marshall Smith is a great new writer with a very unique and invividual voice.  Coming on the heels of his debut, _Only Forward_, _Spares_ confirms that he is definitely someone to watch!<br />Some reviewers have faulted Smith for attempting to shoehorn too many diverse ideas into a single book, or for creating such an unlikeable person in his protagonist, Jack Randall.  Depending on your point of view, this may be a valid criticism.  For me, the mix worked and worked in a magical way I come across all too infrequently in my reading these days.<br />Jack is a drug-addicted former policeman in the surreal future world of New Richmond, Virginia, a grounded MegaMall which has been taken over as the basis for a city.  On the run with a group of spares he's liberated from a Farm, Jack comes up against the same forces which necessitated his escape five years previously.  Throw in the Gap, a strange, interdimensional reality, not quite analagous to cyberspace but similar, in which a war was fought 20 years ago, a war Jack and several of the other characters are veterans of, and the book is almost overflowing with ideas, originality, and an amazing level of energy.<br />If you're a fan of cross-genre mixes, hardboiled/sci-fi, this book is definitely worth your while.  Based on his first two novels and a number of his short stories, including &quot;More Tomorrow,&quot; an excellent Internet horror tale, Smith has quite a future ahead of him and, for now, a dedicated new fan in this critic.	1998-03-30
US	52969730	R27U2ERJUHT1UA	0679457704	880926499	Monstrum	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Riveting Police Procedural, and Much More!	Comparisons of _Monstrum_ to Martin Cruz Smith's _Gorky Park_ are apt.  A very similar sort of thriller, Donald James' novel follows the investigation of homicide inspector, Constantin Vadim, as he searches for a serial killer operating in the rubble of war-torn Moscow, circa 2015.  The future setting doesn't really give this book a science-fictional feel, but allows James to add a complicated political underpinning to his serial-killer plot.  The Anarchists and the Nationalists have just stopped fighting a civil war for the soul of Russia and the clean-up and aftermath of the war only hamper Vadim's investigation, as they also make it possible for the serial-killer &quot;monstrum&quot; of the title to operate.  The characters were very absorbing, the mystery first-rate, and James' exploration of the human condition very gripping.  The conclusion did feel a bit rushed, following a long, leisurely set-up, and the book is a bit too dependent on Vadim's inability to develop political beliefs of his own, but this was, on the whole, a riveting mystery and I'd highly recommend it.	1998-02-19

Though it can definitely be said that _Fear Nothing_ is a re-tread of similar ground that he's covered elsewhere, the trio of main characters in the book is so well-described that they bring the book to real life.  Chris Snow is the narrator, a young man with an unusual biological condition which renders him unable to stand sunlight, or any light for that matter.  Because of this, he's largely a night-owl, prowling around his hometown of Midnight Bay.  What he discovers following the death of his father is a wide-ranging conspiracy which seemingly touches everyone in the town.  Aided by a surfer friend and his radio DJ girlfriend, not to mention his unusually alert dog, Orson, Chris sets out to discover the truth.  This is, as I understand, the first book in a trilogy featuring these characters.  As such, the book demands some patience from the reader, since very little of much substance is revealed in this installment, just enough to make the reader want more.  There are several very effective, very eerie set-pieces in the book, some involving a troupe of enhanced lab monkeys.  When all is said and done, we're faced with many more questions than answers, but long-time Koontz fans will want to see parts two and three of this trilogy to discover the secret behind what is going on.  A strong recommendation.	1998-02-15
US	52969730	R3RG29KW3VEWU1	0393315606	569349859	Morality Play (Norton Paperback Fiction)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An engrossing and intriguing mystery.	_Morality Play_ really caught me by surprise.  Several people had recommended the book to me, but I have to admit I was put off by the &quot;literary&quot; connections that Mr. Unsworth brings to his work.  Well, don't let that stop you.  This is a great, first-rate mystery, which does a great job of putting the reader into the shoes of this medieval theater company, as it attempts to solve a puzzling local mystery by acting it out, in the form of a morality play.  The characters are interesting, individual creations, with Unsworth's narrator, the failed priest, someone I'd like to read more about.  On the basis of this work, I've gone on to try a couple of Unsworth's other books and have yet to be disappointed.	1998-01-25
US	52969730	R2SK4AOEZ9IS28	0440217822	524259522	Buzz Cut	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Not quite as good as earlier books in the Thorn series	James W. Hall has created a unique character in his protagonist Thorn, the \\"hero\\" of a number of books.  Not quite a detective, Thorn nevertheless has a talent for landing in the thick of trouble, often while attempting to help out his friends.  This was the basic conceit in Hall's previously Thorn title, _Gone Wild_, and he uses it again in his latest novel, _Buzz Cut_.  This time, Thorn is motivated to help out his best friend, Sugarman, whose been hired as the head of security for a cruise ship line and has stumbled onto the track of a sociopathic misfit bent on defrauding the company, in order to send money to a growing collection of starving children in Third World countries.  While the book is just as fast-paced and full of twists and turns as any in this continually-growing series (Hall's next book, _Red Sky at Night_, continues Thorn's adventures), _Buzz Cut_ isn't as strong a book as previous titles, wherein Hall was able to incorporate legitimate ecological and environmental concerns (_Mean High Tide_ and _Gone Wild_).  Here, his satirical eye alights on such easy targets as the Donald Trump-like owner of the cruiseline and his talk-show host wife.  An entertaining novel, but not Hall at his best.  And is it just me or is the plot of this book virtually identical to that of the movie _Speed 2_?	1997-05-02

Robinson does a great job of making her ancient Egyptian characters accessible to a modern audience.  Lord Meren, the &quot;Eyes and Ears&quot; of the Pharaoh, is a very complicated character and makes for a very intriguing, if unlikely, detective.  This book, which I picked up entirely out of curiosity, is quite different from my usual diet of dark, hardboiled detective fiction, but I'd still recommend it unreservedly.  I'll definitely be looking for others in the series	1997-05-02
