Bringing his vast knowledge and experience to this book, Baden has created a very believable character in Dr. Jack Rosen and pulls a story together that will entertain with each page. <br /> <br />While Baden walks us through the business of death and getting to the truth through the dead, he also takes us on an investigation with twist and turns that keep the reader guessing. <br /> <br />There is one part that I did not like about this book and that was the ending.  It seemed that while Baden and his wife were great story tellers and walking us through the crime and the investigation, there were only 5 pages spent on pulling the crime together and the explanation.  It would have made a 5 star book if this part was a bit better. <br /> <br />All and all an enjoyable book that will keep you guessing. <br />	2005-09-05

I read Improbable based upon a suggestion from an Amazon friend, and I was not disappointed.  Adam Fawer put together a fascinating story that combined Statistical analysis with medical mystery.  His writing flowed very well, and there was not really dull moment in the book. <br /> <br />The action in this book is very well written and almost non stop.  The characters are well developed and interesting, and most importantly believable.  From a rogue agent of the CIA to a Russian mobster running an underground poker game, all of these characters a vivid and full of life. <br /> <br />For his first novel, I think that Fawer has hit a homerun, and I highly recommend this book to everyone!!! <br />	2005-09-05

Blood of Angels delivers on all levels and introduces a cast of characters that is very interesting. <br /> <br />While you are reading from the perspective of a lawyer, this is not a court room legal thriller, this is a book about revenge pure and simple.  There are multiple sub-plots and action that keep the story moving along, and you will not want to put this one down. <br /> <br />Reed Arvin writes in the first person, which I thought would be a distraction, but I really enjoyed the smooth style.  I would recommend this book to all who are looking for an interesting plot, and a fast moving book that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat.	2005-06-27

I have loved each and every one of their previous books.  With Dance of Death I was very excited to read it as I am with all of their books.  While I enjoyed reading Dance of Death, I was a bit disappointed. <br /> <br />The story itself picks up where Brimstone left off, and right from the start you can see that we are welcoming back characters from many previous books, including Ice Hunt.  The story line is fast moving as Pendergast is searching for his brother who is planning the crime of a lifetime.  The book is fast paced, and exciting, making you want to keep reading.  One of the interesting things is that not only do the characters from previous novels return, but the settings do as well.  We are back in the underground train tunnels of New York, as well as the museum and others.  An interesting twist. <br /> <br />The main problem that I had with the book was that there were some open questions about things that happened, and how they happened.  Some things just seemed wrong, they fit the story line, but they seemed to be plugged in with little thought just to move the story along. <br /> <br />Well, I am looking forward to the last in this series, and maybe that will help tie up some of these loose ends.  I am also looking for a non Pendergast novel from these two.  There has not been one in along time, and I think it would be a refreshing change.	2005-06-20
US	49270461	R28VXPLVZO6K5Q	0743260929	436711866	The Twelfth Card: A  Lincoln Rhyme Novel (Lincoln Rhyme Novels)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Deaver delivers in this Lincoln Rhyme novel!	The Twelfth Card is another in a long line of great Lincoln Rhyme novels, where both the action and the suspense build into a book that you cannot put down. <br /> <br />The book follows the case of an attempted rape that leads to murder and a 100 year old crime.  While investigating the current threats against a smart (both book and street) high school student (Geneva), Rhyme and Sachs must also uncover what happened to her great uncle.  The story is filled with twists and turns that are a hallmark of a good Deaver novel.  <br /> <br />As always there is a little back story about Rhyme fighting against the medical world to test him or like in previous books, try some experimental treatment.  This time I think it fits in very well to the story and adds to the over all enjoyment of the story. <br /> <br />This series is not getting old or stale for me.  Each story is interesting and the growth of Rhyme in dealing with his limits and the future is always interesting. <br /> <br />So with all of these good comments, why not 5 stars?  Well, I thought that the ending was sort of obvious, and I was able to figure out the mastermind prior to the big reveal, so that is why I knocked it down to 4 stars.  All in all a good quick and interesting read that I would highly recommend to fans of Deaver and readers picking up a Rhyme novel for the first time!	2005-06-14

With Map of Bones, Sigma is back and better than ever, Painter Crowe is back but is now the commander sitting behind a desk.  The Sigma lead is Grayson Pierce, and he is one tough character.  He is also dealing with budding love, and a sick father at home.   <br /> <br />The book moves at lightning pace from the start when the Bones of the Magi are stolen and a secret that is held for centuries is about the be unleashed.  The Vatican dispatches two spies, who help Sigma along the path to keep this power out of the hand of the Dragon Court, lead by Raoul a ruthless villain who will stop at nothing to defeat Sigma, and gain the knowledge that has been hidden for 800 years. <br /> <br />There are scenes underwater, and scenes in ancient Churches that bring you into the center of the action.  Rollins has created a book that transports you to where the action is going on, also he has created characters that you care about.  When one is wounded you hope for the best because he has made these heroes seem normal.  Most thrillers make the hero seem like a superman who can do no wrong.  Rollins creates characters that second guess each other, and make mistakes, thus creating a much more believable cast. <br /> <br />All in all Map of Bones is a winner, and one of Rollins best works.  It will grab you and never let go.  I wish this book was 10,000 pages so I could have kept on reading.  I'm looking forward to the next in the Sigma series and I'm sure that will not disappoint!	2005-05-31
US	49270461	R2F2NAIWQNP49U	0976165902	213935822	The Loch	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Not Alten's best work, but still an interesting read.	I have enjoyed Steve Alten's work in the past and figured that The Loch was right in his comfort zone, a large aquatic animal attacking people, sounds like MEG.  Well, the story was good, the monster interesting and mean, and the action was great...BUT if you are looking for characters that make you believe them and make you root for them, or care about them in anyway, this is not the book for you. <br /> <br />The main character is so shallow and hard to understand his motives, it is confusing.  The ending of the book also seemed forced and not very well explained, there are many questions that needed to be answered, and not in a sequel, but in this story.  Some times, I think that Alten is trying more for a movie script than a book, and this is how this one feels, too much action and too little character development.  The horrible choice of writing the dialog of the Scottish characters with their accent was difficult to read, and borders on annoying.  Also the historical diary that is peppered throughout the book in a different type face is hard to read (due to the font) and not really needed. <br /> <br />If the story was not so good, and the action so engaging, this would be a one star book.  If you just want a good exciting read where you feel like you are at a movie, then this is for you, if you are looking for a well written book, look elsewhere.	2005-05-27

Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Tim Green, I really like his style and his plots are always interesting and full of twists and turns.  The First 48 had all of the great things that I have come to expect from Tim Green, but it also had one major flaw, it was too implausible.  The Plot was there, and the twist were there, but I could not get over the fact how out there some of the actions were. <br /> <br />The plot, a father searching for his missing daughter who happened to be about to blow the whistle on a corrupt Senator, has so much potential, but it is ruined by the outrageous and unbelievable actions of the characters.  At the very beginning of the father's search, things start to go downhill for me.   <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading The First 48, and if you can get by the fact that most of the actions of the main characters are unbelievable, then this is the book for you.  As usual this was a quick read that flowed well.  If possible I would have given this book 3.5 stars but I decided to round up seeing the book was entertaining.	2005-04-21
US	49270461	R14SFU3KT37GEH	0385510454	797048445	The Broker: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	New story line sends Grisham to new heights!	After a 2 or 3 year period, I have once again started to like reading Grisham's works, and with The Broker, I have to say that he is on top of the game once again.  Rather than the lawyer story line that we are used to reading from Grisham we get an interesting plot with stolen satellite surveillance software, a federal prisoner freed so the US can try to figure out who kills him, and some twists that make you want to keep reading.    Joel Blackman is released from prison on a Presidential pardon and he has no idea why he was released.  All he knows his he is moved to Italy where most of the story takes place.  The middle of the book takes you on a little tour of Italy while Joel gets lessons in Italian from two instructors.  It is well written and interesting as Grisham keeps the story moving even through these lessons.      There is of course the twists at the end that will keep everyone guessing.  Grisham makes Joel Blackman into a real person that allows you to understand his motives and his actions.  One of the top 3 Grisham books yet, and hopefully the international espionage theme might continue in future books.  I would highly recommend this book to all!!	2005-04-21

I have stated in previous James Patterson reviews that I won't read another Alex Cross novel, every. And then each time I pick up the next one.  At least this time I was smart and took it out of the Library.  <br /> <br />I don't think that it is the plots that bother me about these novels, they are still interesting.  I think that I am sick of Patterson's choppy writing style.  While easy and quick to read, I want more substance in a chapter not 5 lines of dialog and then boom onto something different.  This was something that I found interesting in his earlier novels, but not it is old.  Couple that with the fact that in a normal size font this would be a 150 page book, it is really not a satisfying experience to read these Cross novels. <br /> <br />The twists and turns are there, but they are also getting old (re-used from other Cross novels).  I actually hate how Patterson brings up little Alex for about 5 to 6 pages, and that's it.  Come on, wouldn't that be one of the biggest things on Cross' mind?  More character development would be really nice (well, just some would be nice). <br /> <br />All in all don't waste your time (it won't take much seeing it is really a 150 page book jam packed into 400 pages), try some Ken Follet or even the newest John Grisham which is a spy type novel, you will like them much better.	2005-04-21

Books	4	2	3	N	N	Interesting look at crime	I became interested in looking for these books aver reading Dr. Michael Baden's books.  With the high praise that Baden placed on Dr. Lee I was looking forward to reading this book.   <br /> <br />All in all I enjoyed the cases that Dr. Lee presented.  The Skakel case was particularly interesting as I lived in Mass for a while and heard a lot about this crime.  The facts were laid out prior to going into the investigation and finally trial if there was one.   <br /> <br />While most of the cases proved interesting, I was a bit bored with the long section on JonBenet Ramsey as there was no real conclusion (just like the real case).  Most of the book was dedicated to this case, and all it seemed to be was a bashing at the Police in Boulder.  There was no conclusion drawn, and it just seemed like a lot of writing for basically one statement. <br /> <br />All in all the 4 cases presented other than Ramsey were very interesting.  Obviously Dr. puts his best foot forward and looks very good in all of the cases presented while others look very bad. (Like the police who ruled a natural death a homicide.)  It would be interesting if Dr. Lee presented a case or two where he was stumped and someone or something else helped solve the case that he was working on.  That would eliminate the feeling that if Dr. Lee is on a case, it will be solved. <br /> <br />All in all I would give this book 3.5 stars but I rounded up for  this review.  A good read if you are interested in true crime, or forensics.	2005-04-04

The characters are well written and throughout the first 1/3 of the novel you are learning about each.  <br /> <br />As always Follett creates a wonderful environment, this time covered in snow, which adds to the story and plot.   <br /> <br />Not too technical but enough to convince you that this theft could happen if the right circumstances came together.  I read this book in one day because I could not put it down.   <br /> <br />Great read and highly recommended!!!	2005-03-28

Sandstorm like all of his previous works is a fast paced, action packed adventure that takes to fabulous locations and keeps the action moving.  This is the best Rollins book yet and it is sure to please.<br />Sandstorm begins in England, and after a mysterious murder, an artifact is found inside an ancient statute.  It leads to a race in the desert between two groups searching for the lost city of UBAR.<br />The story leads of a fact paced, and exciting finish that will have you on the edge of your seat turned each page faster and faster.  The writing takes you into the desert and you can feel the Sandstorm heading towards you.  If you are looking to be transported away for a fun filled journey, this is the book for you!<br />Along the way there are the normal twists and turns that keep you wanting more.  Some in the past have said there was not enough character development in Rollins' books, but this time, I think there is just enough.  You get to know what is driving the characters and can see why they are doing the things that they are.  <br />This is a great book for that summer weekend at the beach or just sitting out on your front porch!  Fans of Rollins will love this new book, and if you are a first time reader of Rollins, I am sure that you will be hooked.  I HIGHLY recommend Sandstorm by James Rollins!	2004-06-29

I thought the idea of a life or death contest in the New York Public Library was a great idea.  When I began reading it, I realized that I was not going to be disappointed.  Actually it exceeded my expectations!<br />The Contest takes place in the New York Public Library between 7 competitors, each from a different world, and each with a \\"guide\\".  The action is non-stop, and it is written in a way that transports you to the middle of the action.<br />One of the best things about this book was that it did not let you rest for one page.  I read the book in two days and I really could not put it down until the last page.  The idea is far fetched, if you are into reading something that might actually happen, you might want to shy away from this one, but if you are in a fun exciting read, this one is for you.<br />I read Ice Station by Matt Reilly before I read Contest, and while Ice Station was a bit better, Contest was right up there.  I highly recommend Contest to anyone looking for a fun read that you will find hard to put down.	2004-03-03

I am a huge fan of the Preston/Child books, and I enjoyed Utopia (Lincoln Child's first solo effort), so when I picked up The Codex, I was very excited!  The Codex does not disappoint!<br />Douglas Preston takes you deep into the jungle with 3 brothers in search of their past, and a valuable book, The Codex.  The Broadbent brothers take on a dangerous journey after their eccentric father takes his fortune with him to his tomb.  The brothers split up, and each search for the fortune on their own.<br />Douglas Preston has created a great story that transports you to the deep jungle.  He has created a great story that I highly recommend to any, not just fans of the Preston/Child books.	2004-02-27

I am biased, being a season ticket holder and fan, but if you are looking to find out about being a coach in the NFL, this is the book for you.  Pepper Johnson has been there as a player and as a coach, and he fills the pages of this book with stories from both his playing career and his time as a coach with the Patriots.  <br />Obviously this book focuses on the incredible run to the Super Bowl that that Patriots made in 2001, but more than that it talks about the inner workings of a team, motivation, and the importance of teamwork.  Teamwork was the key to the Super Bowl victory and by reading this book, you can see that it was much more important than some might have thought.  This Patriots team had to overcome many obstacles during the season to win it all, and this book describes how the team came together and won as a unit.<br />Pepper Johnson also describes the rigors of being a coach in the NFL, the long hours (5am to midnight or longer) and hours of watching game tape.  If you have ever wondered what NFL coaches do to game plan, you can find out right here.  Pepper also talks about the importance of the scout team, something that I think many people over look.<br />All in all this is a great football book, not only for Patriot fans, but for all football fans.	2003-12-08

Digital Fortress is a fast moving thriller that will take you around the world, and also inside the NSA.  There are some twists and turns that make the story move along very well.  There might be a bit too much globe trotting to seem realistic, but all in all it makes for a very fun read.<br />Dan Brown uses very short chapters in Digital Fortress that makes for a quick read.  You keep thinking, ok one more chapter, and before you know it you are done with the book.  The climax is a bit unbelievable, but still makes for an interesting section of the book.<br />There were a couple of things that I did not really like about the book, first being that it seems like this book was written to be a movie, and sometimes that takes away from the character development like it did in this case.  Second the ending was very predictable, but all in all I would recommend Digital Fortress as a fun read!	2003-12-04

With Ice Hunt, James Rollins creates a wonderfully fast paced and thrilling story that will once again leave you very satisfied at the end.  Matthew Pike, is a wonderful character that we meet at the start of the novel.  From the opening pages we are thrown into a world of ice and snow, where the thrills are fast and furious.  <br />Ice Hunt is full of the twists and turns that Rollins fans have come to expect.  Ice Station Grendel is described in great detail, and it feels like you are there with the characters.  Ice Hunt has the mix of fantasy as well as reality that makes Rollins books so much fun.  <br />Like all of Rollins' previous works, a scientific phenomenon has been discovered in some remote place.  This time however there are a couple of differences, first and foremost the setting is not the steamy hot rain forest, or jungle, rather the Polar Ice Cap.  Second, there is this element of political involvement in this book, seeing that Ice Station Grendel is a Russian Ice Station and it is discovered by Americans.  But like the other Rollins novels, Ice Hunt delivers a fun and entertaining story that will keep the pages turning.<br />From the opening chapter to the end of this book, Rollins grabs hold of the reader and takes you on a roller coaster of twists and turns that you don't expect.  A must read for fans of Rollins, and a great way for soon to be fans to start reading one of the best writers around today!  I highly recommend Ice Hunt, you will not be disappointed.	2003-12-03

I have been disappointed with the last few Alex Cross books, and I suggested that James Patterson should retire Alex Cross as he was becoming a superman.  Well, in this book there is still some superman to Alex Cross, but seeing Alex in training at the FBI and in a small office and being talked down to was a refreshing change of pace.<br />The character of Wolf was the best villain that Cross has faced off against yet.  There are many twists and turns in this one, and that will keep the pages turning.  I also enjoyed that Patterson threw in a &quot;family crisis&quot; that really did not revolve around some type of attack at his home.  All in all this book was very fun to read.<br />As always with Patterson, if you are looking for great literature, look elsewhere.  Patterson's writing style if fast and sort of choppy.  This is another of the famous 150 page books jammed into 400 pages.  Some people may not enjoy a 2 or 3 page chapter, but I think it makes you want to read that one more chapter before turning off the lights.<br />Overall, much better than the last few Alex Cross novels, and a fun, light, quick read!	2003-12-03

Still Life with Crows is one of those books you just find very hard to put down.  This time Special Agent Pendergast of the FBI spends his \\"vacation\\" in Kansas investigating a series of strange events.  He is assisted by the interesting character of Corrie Swanson.<br />Still Life with Crows delivers the twists and turns that you expect from Preston/Child, and if you are a fan you will enjoy the references to past characters from other Preston/Child works.<br />The setting of Kansas, in the middle of the corn fields, adds to the mystery of the story.  There are some creepy scenes in this book, and I bet you will not want to venture to far out of your house at night after reading this one.  You might not want to eat turkey on Thanksgiving either.<br />All in all Preston/Child have delivered and created a wonderful story that will keep you turning the pages.  A great summer read!	2003-06-13

If you have read any of the Preston/Child books in the past, this will not disappoint!  <br />Utopia takes place in a futuristic theme park in Nevada.  It is filled with futuristic rides that blast you into zero gravity and filled with holographic surprises around every corner.  The park, named Utopia, is completely shut off from the outside world, and thus makes for a fascinating setting to an action packed day.<br />The story basically takes you through Dr. Andrew Warne's first visit to a theme park that he in a way helped create.  He is there to help fix a computer program that he created to control all of the parks robots.  But this is no ordinary day as John Doe (who we know very little about) is in the park to pull of the crime of the century.  The story is fast paced as Warne others try to stop Doe from pulling of the crime and killing the innocent people in the park.  <br />From the opening chapter to the last page there are twists and turns that will keep you turning the pages.  We meet interesting side characters like Wingnut, a robot dog, and are taken along on the rides in the park that are described in a way that makes you feel like you are sitting next to the person in the book.  There are some technical aspects of the park in the book, but I think that this adds to the overall story!  <br />All in all a wonderful novel and a great solo work by Mr. Child.  I highly recommend this book, and all other Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child books!	2002-12-27

I have to say that I suggested that James Patterson retire Alex Cross after the last book, and was reluctant to give this one a try.  But I am glad that I did, as this was a good book that was a little different than all of the rest of the Cross books.<br />I liked the fact that Sampson was a big part of this story.  He is often too much of a background character, and as proven in this story he has a lot to offer.  I also liked the fact that Alex Cross was not super human.  He was stumped here for a while and was not always right.  (This was what I hated about the last book, Alex was right all of the time.)  I also liked the hinting that Cross might retire.  I think it is time from him to move on to maybe a secondary role in a Sampson novel or something like that.<br />I do have one complaint about this book, it was a 200 page novel packed into 400+ pages.  The font was large and the borders were huge.  I was expecting a bit more, but all in all a good read.	2002-12-13

Steve Alten's Goliath is a fascinating story of terrorism and technology that keeps you reading from the first page to the last.<br />A futuristic sub that has it's own mind is only on of the main characters that makes Goliath so enjoyable.  The character of Gunnar Wolfe is very interesting and adds to the story.  <br />But the main character is the sub Goliath.  A stealth submarine that has it's own brain that allows it to &quot;think&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; is down right frightening. <br />Goliath also has the sub plot of a two halves of a failed marriage attempt forced back together to help stop a killing machine that they helped create.  All in all this was a great read and I would highly recommend this book to all!	2002-10-30

I enjoyed the story line about the killer, the fisherman, and I thought that the idea of Jack being a Police Officer was a good one, I just wish that more time were spent in the territories.<br />All in all, if you like Stephen King, then this might work for you, just don't expect a story like the Talisman.	2002-09-18

But by then end you are saying, what an interesting waste of time.  <br />The Brethren starts out strong with the idea of three former judges blackmailing men from inside a federal prison and getting away with it, until they target the wrong man.  This is a great idea, full of promise and somehow Grisham looses all of that promise in the end.  <br />One of the things that I still do not understand about this book is when of the people being blackmailed actually finds his way to Fla., and finds the lawyer who is the outside man in this scheme.  We hear about him finding the lawyer, and then what, he just drops off the face of the Earth?  Also the ending is very weak, and so predictable that it almost not worth the effort to finish the book.  <br />I started out thinking that I was going to like this book and recommend it highly, but I am sorry to say that this was one of Grisham's biggest let downs, and I would have to say, do not waste your time.	2002-09-18

The descriptions of the Amazon, and the characters are brought to life in vivid detail.<br />When I first began reading Amazonia, I thought that maybe the idea was a bit to far fetched, A man who had one arm going into the Amazon comes out with two?  I mean that is really out there, and I was skeptical, but as the story moves along, the plot takes hold and you are brought into a wonderful world with surprises around every corner.<br />I especially liked the descriptions of the village in the end of this book, they were fascinating.  I read Amazonia in two nights, and once you pick it up, I think you will have a hard time putting it down!<br />I highly recommend James Rollins' Amazonia!	2002-09-18

I am a huge fan of these two, and for some odd reason, I never picked up The Relic.  No I am mad at myself for not picking it up earlier.<br />Having read Reliquary and all of their other books, I had the basic story line of The Relic down before I opened the cover, so I was not expecting much.  Well, I was wrong, this book is filled with incredible action, and details that keeps it moving at such a fast pace.  <br />One mistake leads to another, and things just keep moving.  I enjoyed meeting Agent Pengergrast for the first time, and I though the other characters were developed very well.<br />All in all, this is the first Preston Child book, and it is still the best, Cabinet of Curiosities comes in a close second!  This book is highly recommended!  <br />Also, if you have seen the movie, pick up the book, there are so many differences that it is almost a whole new story!	2002-09-18

The Fourth Perimeter was my first Tim Green novel and it will not be my last.  Mr. Green creates fascinating characters that we get to know as they deal with some traumatic events in their lives.  The plot of this book is somewhat unbelievable, but as the story unfolds the believability becomes greater and greater.<br />This is attention to detail with the characters and with their actions.  I really felt that the book flowed very well, and was a book that kept you turning page after page wanting to see what would happen next.  <br />The twist at the end was somewhat predictable, but still added to the story very well.  I look forward to reading another Tim Green Novel very soon!	2002-08-05

I picked up The Hunt for Red October after seeing the movie (many times) and I was very surprised at how different the two were.  I should tell you right at the top that the movie is one of my all time favorite films, so I started off with the idea that I would like this book.<br />The first thing that struck me was the differences in the character of Jack Ryan.  In the movie he knew so much about Ramius that it seemed like they were brothers, but in the book it seemed much more realistic that Ryan knew little to nothing about Ramius.  Also the amount of detail about the lives of the Russian crew was very interesting.  I enjoyed reading about what the Russian childhood was like for Ramius.<br />The thing that surprised me the most about this book was that it was fairly easy to read.  I had always heard that it was very technical and a very slow read, but I found it just the opposite.  While there were technical parts, most of the book was build up for the main turn over of The Red October.  I also liked how Skip Taylor played a much bigger role in the story.  <br />All in all a good read, that I would recommend highly.	2002-06-25

Preston and Lincoln Child have been consistently writing novels that keep me reading until the early hours of the morning.  The Cabinet of Curiosities was along the same lines as their other works, seeing that I finished it at 2am!  The writing style is easy to read and these two keep the action/surprises there mixed in with the brilliant details making their books almost impossible to put down!<br />The Cabinet of Curiosities was a wonderful novel that brought great action and scientific details together to form a compelling story.  The Characters of Nora Kelly, Bill Smithback and Agent Pendergast are back and they form a great trio that moves this book along at a great pace.<br />The Novel has all of the great twists and turns that you come to expect from these two authors, and they are at the top of their game in this one. I would highly recommend this book and I would also recommend all of the other Preston Child books as they will not disappoint!	2002-06-25

Each one adds details and surprises that makes each one more interesting.  The story line is simple, but the interactions between characters wonderful and there are many surprises for young and old alike.<br />The Harry Potter series has taken the world by storm and there are many reasons why.  These books will make your children happy to read, and keep you adults happy by presenting an interesting story.<br />Each of these novels has a brilliant cover that captures the Harry Potter magic and adds to the overall enjoyment of the series.<br />I would recommend this boxed set to young and old alike.  All will enjoy these fascinating stories!	2002-06-25

However, I think that the Place of Truth was a wonderful end to this great series.<br />Christian Jacq had created a great mystery in the past tree books.  I picked up each book and read it with eagerness trying to figure out who the traitor was inside the brotherhood.  Well this time he keeps you waiting until almost the last page, keeping the suspense there right up until the end.  <br />This book has all of the things that I look for in a Christian Jacq book, good character interaction, so action, and a great story. <br />All in all this was a fitting end to a great series of books.  I would highly recommend reading this entire series.	2002-06-06

When the Baby Meg that was in captivity escapes, the chase is on and it is more exciting than ever in this novel.<br />This book is a great follow up not only because of the excitement it brings, but also because of its great character development.  There is a new villain on the scene and it is not a Shark; rather a multi-millionaire named Singer.  This adds so much more to this story. <br />The same cast of characters is back and the action is still there.  This is a great summer read, just don't read it at the beach!	2002-06-06

So I decided to pick up Esau from the bargain bin and give it a try.<br />I was surprised, Mr. Kerr was able to create an adventure that made me keep turning the pages to see what would happen next.  There were a couple of different story lines here, and they were all very interesting.  Most of this book is far fetched, so be prepared to leave reality at the door.  <br />The characters were interesting, and they made you want to find out what would happen to them.  I thought that Kerr was good at creating a realistic scene in his writing and really seemed to have a great deal of knowledge about climbing. <br />I would recommend this book to all fans of Rollins, or Preston + Child.  Good read that kept me interested.	2002-06-04

I was drawn into this book by the plot and wonderful characters that Powlik creates.  <br />The idea of a biological weapon getting into the wrong hands, or slipping from a research facility takes on more interest in the wake of Sept 11.  This book is both thrilling and frightening, because it might be able to happen.  Well, maybe not, but it is a fun read that will keep you turning the pages wanting to see what will happen next.<br />All in all I enjoyed this book and cannot wait to read the next Powlik work, Meltdown!	2002-04-03

I'll admit, I was one of the thousands of adults that thought Harry Potter books were kids books and that I would not enjoy them.  But after hearing friend after friend pick up these books and enjoy them, I thought I would give them a try.<br />I am sure glad that I did.  From the opening of the Sorcerer's Stone, I was taken to a world of wizards and witches.  The writing was very easy to read, but there were some story lines that were very interesting.  This was a book that took me to a different place, Hogwarts.  It was great ways to take your mind off the stresses of life and read a happy story about a young boy making his dreams come true.<br />This was a good book for all ages, and I highly recommend it to everyone!	2002-04-03

When I saw that Warlock was released I was very excited.  After reading &quot;Warlock&quot; I was not disappointed!<br />From the first page Warlock brings you back into the world that Smith brilliantly created in &quot;River God&quot;.  Taita is back and he is a free man this time.  He is taking care of Prince Nefer who will grow to become a powerful warrior and ruler.  Wilbur Smith describes the battles of Egypt very well, and not a detail is missed.<br />There was only on issue with this book that disappointed me, and it was Taita.  Smith took a man that had a talent for reading the mazes, and made him into an all powerful warlock who could conjure storms from thin air, and stop anyone in his path with almost a look.  This seemed way to far fetched and took at bit away from this book. <br />All in all, I enjoyed &quot;Warlock&quot; as much as I enjoyed &quot;River God&quot; and hope there will be another in this series.	2002-03-27

So I was surprised to be turning the pages of this book with anticipation when I began reading.   This book seemed to grab hold from the beginning ad not really let go until the last couple of chapters.  <br />The story line is interesting and I was happy to see that this book did not play out in a courtroom, like many of Grisham's works.  I found only one flaw and I would guess it is a fairly major one, the ending was very predictable.  The story line kept you guessing for about the first half of the book, but mid way through, you could predict the end very easily.<br />I would say that this book fit the bill if you are looking for a fun, quick read that does not really require much thought to figure out.  All in all I would say a so-so work by Grisham.	2002-03-27

Well, that's what I got with \\"Deception Point\\"!<br />When I first started reading this book, I was a bit afraid that the plot was just to out there for my liking, well by the middle of the book a 180-degree plot twist made me more interested in this fun book.<br />This was an easy read that was a great book for those times where you do not want to have to think that much about the plot.  I think that this book would make an excellent movie and that the characters were well developed and the plot was fascinating.<br />All in all I would highly recommend this book!	2002-03-27

I am of the opinion that James Patterson should let the Alex Cross series end with one more book.  When I first started reading the cross novels, I could not put them down, one after the other I read and enjoyed.  Now I look forward to the Cross novels as a quick read that requires little thinking.<br />It might be that I am growing tired of the same old story lines with hardly anything new showing up in the personal life of Alex Cross.  Or maybe I just am starting to find it really hard to believe that this detective would not ever make a mistake.  I really enjoyed 1st to Die and I think that it was because it was Patterson's same style but new and refreshing characters.<br />All in all this was a fair book.   Easy to read and fast.  If you like the Alex Cross series you will like this book.  But I think that it is time for Dr. Cross to retire.	2002-01-08

I think that James Patterson needs to let go of Alex Cross and put his focus here.  This was a great book with a wonderful plot that kept me interested from page one.  I could not put this book down.   <br />This was written In Mr. Patterson's easy to read style and was a very fast read.  I think that this was one of his better books that have come out in the last couple of years.<br />Rather than relying on the old and worn out character of Alex Cross, Patterson creates a new set of characters that are just as interesting and a lot less predictable.<br />I would recommend this book to all, especially if you are looking for a book that will grab you from page one and keep you interested until the last page!	2002-01-08

I loved Excavation and I liked Subterranean, but I thought that they were almost the exact same plot. I was nervous that Deep Fathom would be another Excavation and Subterranean. Was I wrong! This book grabbed me from page one and would not let me go. I really liked how this book really did not focus on the supernatural, or non-human enemy, but rather had an enemy that was human, and with revenge as a driving force, it was very believable. <br />I also liked how this story had two different locations, under the ocean, and then in the risen ruins of an ancient city. I think this added to the overall enjoyment of the book. Rather than just be stuck in the came cave, we jumped from undersea to ruins, back to undersea, to a naval battle...and so on. It kept things moving at a great pace. <br />I would say that this book is James Rollins' best work to date, and I cannot wait to read his next novel!	2001-08-02
