This book, and similar titles from Linux Journal Press and Sams, have begun to address this issue, hopefully bringing greater interest in the platform.<br />The Zope Book was written by Zope developers and is targeted at Web developers and admins who have some experience with Web applications but possibly not content management technology. <br />Part 1, Introducing Zope, is designed to get the reader started with Zope, explaining how to download, install, and configure the software using the platform's graphical interface. The section describes what Zope can do, explains the basics of the Zope content object model, and introduces Zope's server-side templating environment, Document Template Markup Language (DTML). <BR> <BR>Part 2, Creating Web Applications with Zope, gets into the meat of actually making Zope applications. The section talks about scripting with Python and Perl, user security searching, connecting to a variety of relational databases, metadata, and advanced DTML.<br />Part 3, Developing Advanced Web Applications with Zope, covers the Zope Enterprise Objects model, scaling and extending Zope, and Zope classes.<br />Appendixes include DTML and Zope API references and a guide to Zope resources, including mailing lists and Web sites.<br />The Zope Book is not the ultimate Zope refernce, and isn't meant to be.	2002-01-25

Beginning in the early-1980s, the Observer virtually invented the &quot;shoot&quot; style of reporting on wrestling, in part paving the way for the sport's renaissance in the 1990s. The Observer is in many ways the opposite of the traditional wrestling magazines that pretend the competitions in the ring are real. The Observer really is a newsletter: the November 12th issue, for instance, was twelve pages long and jammed with well over 30,000 words. Though it has no photos or glossy cover, the Observer is the pro wrestling's journal of record.<br />Meltzer is well known for his obituaries. When someone prominent in the business dies, Meltzer produces an amazingly complete and insightful story of their life that appears in the Observer typically days after their death. Given the fragmented and uncertain nature of pro wrestling history, these obituaries may be the most important and compelling accounts of wrestling's past currently available. <br />This obit collection is different from the 1998 edition of Tributes published in partnership with Powerbomb.com. The 2001 edition has been re-edited, contains many more photographs, and some of the obits have been replaced by newer stories. <br />The current edition presents stories on the lives of Andre the Giant, Art Barr, Boris Malenko, Brian Pillman, Bruiser Brody, Buddy Rogers, Dino Bravo, Eddie Gilbert, Fritz Von Erich, Giant Baba, Gordon Solie, John Studd, Jumbo Tsuruta, Junkyard Dog, Kerry Von Erich, Louie Spicolli, Owen Hart, Ray Stevens, Rick Rude, and Yokozuna. All of the stories are detailed and fascinating, but some stand out, particularly Meltzer's Bruiser Brody obituary.	2001-11-18

It's still the best available, but now in its fourth edition, HTML &amp; XHTML is beginning to show its age. While I would still recommend it for Web professionals who need a reference, I'm not sure I would suggest it to folks just starting out.<br />The art and science of Web creation are going through fundamental changes. HTML is slowly being supplanted by XML, and structure and presentation are finally and irrevocably being separated. I would suggest that within the next three years this book will need to be replaced with a similar broad introduction to Web authoring, something that covers the basics of XML, CSS, XSL and JavaScript, with little mention at all of HTML. But we will see.<br />In the meantime, this is still the book to grab when you have an HTML problem to solve. The appendices, in particular, are invaluable.	2001-02-04

Rather, the book works  best as a reference for those with a solid, intermediate knowledge of HTML  who want to contextualize what they know and move on to the next step.  <br />This is a book about HTML, and it does not cover all aspects of making  Web pages. Such things as DOM, DHTML and JavaScript are really beyond the  scope of this book, and are covered in other, also excellent, O'Reilly  publications.<br />If one is serious about Web design then one needs to learn  HTML and code it by hand; The Definitive Guide is an excellent resource for  this.	2000-06-30

Segel's work is from 1926, translated and  supplemented with an excellent and lengthy introduction by University of  Illinois-Chicago professor Richard Levy. An appendix excerpts the Protocols  themselves, and this should be enough primary material for anyone who wants  to introduce themselves to the ludicrous text itself.	2000-06-30

But now, in the year 2000, it seems a bit quaint and  unnecessary, like a 1995 Internet how-to book. <br />Instead of purchasing  this book, I would suggest popping over to Broadcast.com. Browse the wide  variety of content there, and consult the Help pages for assistance with  installing media players. Sites like Yahoo Broadcast, RealGuide, and  WindowsMedia.com provide more than enough introductory material for the  novice, and countless media streams to choose from.	2000-06-15

Hackers are the modern-day equivalent of the gunslingers of the American frontier, exploited by the media and  misunderstood by a public fascinated by them. The picture of Mitnick  presented by Shimomura and Markoff is no better then an account of Billy  the Kid in a 19th century penny dreadful.<br />Don't purchase this book  without picking up Jonathan Littman's excellent Fugitive Game. There are  two stories to every side, and the Kevin Mitnick saga is no exception.  Littman presents a much more complex and problematic account of Mitnick's  exploits and the media circus that has surrounded him.	2000-05-19

These days, I suggest Creating Web Pages for Dummies. <br />What I liked best about this  book was that it more or less stuck to the basics. There is an awful lot to  know about creating the Web; so much so, in fact, that it is easy for a  knowledgeable author to overwhelm the reader. The other extreme, of course,  is skirting over fundamental areas. Creating Web Pages for Dummies pretty  much covers everything in enough depth for someone to put together a  personal Web site fairly quickly.<br />Creating Web Pages for Dummies starts  out by explaining the fundamentals of HTML and the Web, and then moves into  more complex topics, such as how to pick an ISP. One of the great strengths  of the book is its focus on a range of simple WYS editors. Web-makers who  are just starting do not have to go out and buy a $200 or $300 Web editor;  there are a number of very good and very usable tools out there that don't  cost a dime.<br />This book is only a beginning; if you want to get serious  about Web design, you'll have to move onto other, more advanced books. But  Creating Web Pages for Dummies is an excellent introduction to the subject.	2000-05-18

It is such a shame that this charming and useful book is out of print. Nothing has ever quite captured the challenges of rewards of community-style radio as this book by Peter Hunn.<br />When Hunn was struck by  the idea of creating his own radio, he assumed there would be books to tell  him how to go about it. As anyone in broadcasting will tell you, radio  technology sometimes seems like the closely guarded arcana of engineers and  corporations. So he wrote this book, a practical and entertaining narrative  about building a low-power station, WHRC-FM, for about $40 000.	2000-05-17

Deconstructing Web Graphics.2 is an exception, and should sit on every serious Web designer's shelf.  <br />Like all of Weinman's work, the book strikes an excellent balance  between inspiration and practical techniques. This is a good book for  designers who have some experience with Photoshop or Fireworks and want to  take the next step. Weinman focuses on case studies of various Web design  challenges, and looks at such areas as DHTML, Flash, and Photoshop layers.	2000-05-08

To paraphrase Bret Hart, professional wrestling is a lot more real than people realize. It is a highly competitive and physically demanding endeavor, both unrecognized art form and brutal, sleazy sideshow. The  Complete Idiot's Guide does little to capture this essence of pro  wrestling, instead treating in the same half-hearted manner that so many  books and articles have in the past.   To make matters worse, the Guide  contains several factual errors and gaps, most glaringly when dealing with  the legitimacy of wresting as an actual physical contest. The reality is  that no one really knows when wrestling became \\"fake,\\" in the sense of  matches having pre-determined outcomes and workers co-operating with each  other. The real, factual history of pro wrestling will probably never be  known. We do know, however, that the wrestling of today is a direct  ancestor of 19th century carnival wrestling, where match outcomes were, at  best, manipulated.<br />It is ironic that this book came out only a few months  before Mick Foley's Have a Nice Day. The two books could not be more  different. Foley is insightful, never talking down to the reader, and  avoids the huckster's wink that seems to accompany most wrestling books,  including the Idiot's Guide. The very last thing wrestling needs is another  \\"fun send-up.\\"<br />As alternatives, I would suggest in particular the Foley  book, the new Dynamite Kid autobiography, and Dave Meltzer's Tributes. If  you can find it and are interested in the early history of pro wrestling, I  strongly recommend Fall Guys: The Barnums of Bounce. Though written in  1937, it seems to be describing the wrestling of today.	2000-02-03

My disappointment began when I read the chapter on &quot;ape men&quot; and the possible survival of bigfoot-like hominids well into the  modern era. While I'm not completely closed to the idea, the section  smacked of pseudo-science: little better than the Bigfoot books of the  1970s and filled with dubious eye witness accounts and third-hand facts.  Given all the silliness and exploitation within crypto-zoology over the  years, we need a bit more than what the authors provide to take this  seriously.<br />And so it is for much of this book. Cremo and Thompson have  collected a great deal of material, some if contradictory, much of is  dubious, and crafted a thesis which is difficult to trust. That's a shame,  because there is more than enough fascinating, legitimate material on  anomalous discoveries to easily fill a book this size.	2000-02-01

A colourful tile  that might look fashionable in the late-19th century can look quaint or  garish in the 1990s. <br />Cabarga presents literally hundreds of historical  colour combinations based on actual period designs. What makes this useful  is that each design comes complete with CMYK codes which can be plugged  directly into Photoshop, or converted (roughly) into HTML colour  codes.<br />It is no exageration to say that this book has opened me up to a  world of colour combinations that I wouldn't have considered in the past.
