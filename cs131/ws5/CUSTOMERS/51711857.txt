Professor Ferling is an apparent master of the primary sources, and offers  many useful insights, but the reader is repeatedly jarred by the author's  infelicitous use of  language, and by the unaccountable failure of Oxford  University Press to exercise the most ordinary functions of  editing.<BR>  Was &quot;notoriety&quot; what the ambitious young Washington  sought? Did  Jefferson really seek to live in a &quot;grandiose&quot; manner? And since  Adams had no recorded connection with artillery, can we believe that he  studied &quot;cannon law&quot;?<BR> I stickied boners like these, all in  the first half of the book,  until the book looked like a pink porcupine.  Apparently another, more diligent editor, was assigned the second half.<BR>  This reader never expected, not in the deepest bouts of pessimism, to write  a review like about an Oxford book. Perhaps Western civilization really is  doomed.	2000-08-07

This reviewer deplores the mandatory requirement for rating &quot;stars&quot;.<br />The important contribution of the Franch Army in the Gulf War has been                      largely overlooked in the  English-speaking countries. Their &quot;left hook&quot;                       around Saddam's forces was a crucial element in the strategy of his                       defeat. Perhaps more important for the future, for the first  time since                      World War Two, French and American troops  stood side by side                      against a common enemy,  rediscovering their common bonds and                      heritage in the  process. Colonel Cooke, a French-fluent military                       intelligence and armor officer who teaches Middle Eastern history in                       civilian life, was uniquely qualified for liason with the  &quot;Division Daguet&quot;                      (French 6th Light Armored  Division), bringing to the task not only                      military  expertise but a sensitive and informed understanding of these                       highly capable but prickly warriors. His book is an admirably clear  and                      complete record of the Daguet operations, and has  enough context to                      serve as a good one-volume history  of the overall land conflict as well.

RANCOR:  &quot;...bitter, long-lasting resentment; deep-seated ill will...&quot; (American Heritage College Dictionary, Third Edition). <br /> In their survey of the use of communications media by the Right, the  professors round up the usual suspects (David Duke; Skinheads), but readers  may be startled to also find in the roster of villains such figures as Rush  Limbaugh, Bill Buckley, the Gun Owners of America, the Libertarians (!),  and the Promise Keepers. The defamation is often accomplished by weaselly  circumlocutions such as &quot;some critics have suggested&quot; and  &quot;some critics make a direct correlation&quot; between mainstream  conservatives and hatemongers. The authors' hand is further tipped by their  assertion of &quot;the right of other people - especially those of Africa,  Asia, Latin America, and other non-white areas - to avail themselves of  democratic opportunities in the United States&quot;. How many Americans   would recognize any such &quot;right&quot;? <br />  For further study,  internet addresses are provided for &quot;hate groups&quot; but, oddly, not  for the organizations which the authors quote with approval Right wing  short-wave radio stations are listed, but no frequency guides are given for  those who might wish to sample their activities firsthand.  <br /> A  Democratic fundraising letter from James Carville is reproduced IN LARGE  PRINT.

In his thirty-year career Revell was involved in most of the major FBI investigations, from the JFK assassination to the bombings at the Atlanta Olympics and the World Trade Center. He offers an insider's knowledge with  a balanced perspective on such various matters as Hoover's sex life and the  Waco debacle, and is frank enough to acknowledge poor judgement (including  the criminal destruction of a key document) in the Ruby Ridge incident. (He  does fail to mention, however, Randy Weaver's sizable civil award from the  U.S. Government.)<BR> The book is engagingly written and provides useful  insight into one of our most important institutions. The internal politics  of the agency may not be compelling reading for many, but there is plenty  of other interesting material for anyone interested in the FBI and federal  law enforcement.

For anyone interested in Patton, whether as military leader or fascinating character study, Blumenson's work is a gold mine.<BR>  As might be expected, some of the elements of the famous personality are visible from  the earliest days: the perfectionism and capacity for unstinting labor, the  startling arrogance and brutal political opinions, (more Caesarian than  American); the uncanny sense of destiny; the unrivalled expertise. The  calculated bluster and profanity, the cultivated &quot;war face&quot;, and  other actorish features of the public persona are less apparent, simply  because they were less likely to be committed to paper. (Patton often  seemed to be writing for posterity, even in family letters.)<BR> Patton's  own words and Blumenson's expert annotation and editing clearly reveal a  man dedicated to his profession, and determined to succeed; by hard-earned  skill and knowledge, but also by shameless politicking and worldclass  brownnosing.<BR> Patton's 1940-45 papers are available from Da Capo in a  companion work.<BR> (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately  ineradicable feature of the page.

Dickerson, who is something of an expert on the area, looks at the Delta's dark underside in this highly readable and admirably researched investigative report.<BR> He labors to weave together rednecks, the Mafia,  wealthy Memphis businessmen, politicians, and cops into a coherent web of  conspiracy against Civil Rights and war protest, but his results tend to be  suggestive rather than conclusive.<BR> He does seem to have read everything  ever written on the region, and in the face of such impressive effort it  seems almost ungrateful to point out that the Little Rock Central High  School crisis took place in 1957, not 1954, and the Vietnam War did not end  with the American withdrawal in 1973, but such lapses will serve as useful  reminders that sweeping exposes must be received with a degree of caution.	1998-12-03

My Rise, first published in English in 1928, details the dictator's early life and accession to power, in his own words.

The latter Duce, written as a virtual prisoner of Hitler,  attempts to justify his place in history and escape personal responsibility  for the disaster he brought upon the nation he undoubtedly loved.<BR>  Essential reading for anyone interested in the origins of the Second World  War.

Starting with basic  shelter, which were sometimes actually caves in the earliest days, she goes  on to describe in detail the critical element of food supply, with careful  explanations of culinary practices and useful drawings to illustrate the  often-obscure utensils. (This latter feature will fascinate antique buffs.)  Also covered are the home production of textiles, the dress of the  colonists, travel, religious and social practices, flower gardens, and  other matters, providing modern readers an insight into everyday colonial  life hard to find elsewhere.<BR> Earle's work is a feast of enjoyable  information for history readers, collectors, and anyone else who wants to  know how the early settlers lived.

The effects that can be achieved are  very impressive indeed.<BR> The illustrations are generous and nicely  reproduced, and the instruction first rate.

Justly called the &quot;Butcher of Prague&quot;, Obergruppenfuhrer  Reinhard Heydrich was perhaps the most dangerous man in the world in 1942.  <BR> Combining an undeniable intelligence and political skill with an utter  lack of scruples, Hitler's chief of security police, had he lived to  succeed the Fuhrer, might have proved an even more formidable opponent for  the Allies than his predecessor. For this reason and others more immediate,  he had to be removed.<BR> The story of the desperate suicide mission by  Czech and Slovak patriots is thoroughly researched and well told here, in  this most complete account of the assassination and the tragic consequences  that shocked the world.

Although intended as a college journalism textbook for aspiring editorial  and opinion writers, &quot;Writing Opinion for Impact&quot; has great  potential utility for anyone concerned with communication through the  written word.<BR> The author begins with a thoughtful discussion of the  power and responsibilities of the opinion writer, examines in detail the  nuts and bolts of persuasive writing (with pertinent comments and examples  from other writers as varied as Dave Barry and Mortimer Zuckerman), and  devotes attention to such specialized areas as humorous writing, arts  reviews, and sports. Ethical issues and common pitfalls are prominently  featured throughout. For those pursuing the subject methodically, each  chapter concludes with a handy summary, recommendations for further  reading, and practical exercises.<BR> Whether you are a budding mover of  public opinion, a letter-to-the-editor devotee seeking greater powers of  persuasion, or just a reader who wants to know how it all works, Professor  Fink's work is highly recommended, not only for its content, but also as a  model of lucid writing in itself.

Interestingly, the author views World Wars I and II, and the Cold War,  essentially as one extended conflict of the North Atlantic peoples, rooted  in geography and climate.<BR> Using the adventures of a World War II  infantryman of the U.S. 66th Division, a busy Liberty Ship, and a  peripatetic bottle of rum as unifying elements, Hatcher inventively  reinterprets the conflict through themes of sky, sand, snow, sea, and  shore, more specifically, the turning point battles of Britain (air), North  Africa (sand), Stalingrad (snow), North Atlantic (sea), and Normandy  (shore). Along the way he touches on some old traditions of the British  Navy, assesses in passing the personalities of leaders, notes the function  of music and the arts in the war effort, and traces the contribution of  Humphrey Bogart! <BR> This is such an entertaining and useful work that it  seems churlish to mention typos and errors (&quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle  Boy&quot; is indelibly identified with the Andrews Sisters, not Bing  Crosby, and who could mistake the immortal Spike Jones hit &quot;Der  Fuhrer's Face&quot; as the work of Vaughn Monroe?).

The common conception of black Southerners in the Civil War has described  a people unified by their opposition to the Confederacy and resisting the  Southern war effort, either passively and actively.<BR> This view can only  be maintained by ignoring a mass of research material that strongly  suggests that black opinion, like other opinion, was represented across the  spectrum, and was strongly influenced by sectional, local, and family  loyalties which have largely disappeared in the modern world, but which  were of paramount importance in the nineteenth century. Many blacks, free  and slave, in fact, considered themselves Southerners first and blacks  second, and served the Southern cause enthusiastically.<BR> This  unconventional view is supported here by a wealth of clippings, rosters,  memoirs, photos, archival records, and other data to convincingly  demonstrate that the matter is more complex than the simplifiers of history  would have it, and to show that the actual record of the black Southerner  leaves no firm ground for those who would cite his experiences for modern  political purposes.<BR> (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately  ineradicable feature of the page.

US	51711857	R1HJY476J2P5WO	0811703347	706872893	Portals to Hell	Books	5	16	19	N	N	Excellent history.	Americans are pleased to think of our Civil War ancestors as gallant,  chivalrous warriors,  magnanimous to those defeated in battle.<BR> The  sorry record of the treatment of prisoners, North and South, calls for a  more somber  perspective. Yes, traditional American unpreparedness and  incompetence were more operant  than malevolence. Yes, inadequate  distribution systems and supply shortages caused much misery.  And yes,  infectious diseases, poorly understood at the time, took a heavy toll on  every stratum of  society, even reaching into the White House. But those  circumstances don't account for the  56,000 men, mostly young, who died in  captivity.<BR> The sad fact is that many were starved, neglected, and  abused to death. How, where, and why  are explained in this well researched  and skillfully written work, tracing the actual operations of  POW camps on  both sides. Drawing on official documents, newspapers, letters, diaries,  and  manuscripts, Speer has constructed a highly readable, comprehensive  history of this little-known  subject, which will be of enduring value to  libraries, military history collections, and Civil War  students, and  should serve as a corrective to those inclined to take an overly romantic  view of the  War. <br /> (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately  ineradicable feature of the page.

The authors have researched and visited the grave sites of all 425  Confederate generals, even those  overseas.<BR> Each is listed complete  with a picture of the man, details of his life and military career (with  some  corrections of errors on gravestones),  name and location of the  cemetery, (with detailed directions  to the obscure ones), and a photo of  the grave marker.<BR> The basic layout is by State, but the Table of  Contents, Alphabetical Listing, and Index make it easy  to find any  information. The usefulness is further augmented by tables showing where  the generals  were born, died, and are buried, the region and branch where  they served, when and where mortal  injury took place, (where applicable),  and the numbers laid to rest in various types of cemeteries.  <BR> In sum,  an admirable production, highly recommended for libraries and military  history collections,  and a valuable addition to anyone's Civil War  bookshelf. <br /> (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately  ineradicable feature of the page.

Private Ettinger, in his brief military career, managed to experience the  battle of the Argonne Forest,  survive four close shell bursts, a personal  strafing by a German pilot, and some spectacular crashes  on his  dispatch-rider motorcycle, to provide us with one of the most engaging  memoirs of the  American Expiditionary Forces.<BR> His very readable and  entertaining reminiscences, augmented by some first-rate research by his  son,  are enhanced by rare photos, interesting appendices, and details of  organization of a unit with some  of the most colorful characters in  American military history, such as &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan, Father   Duffy, Joyce Kilmer, and Douglas Macarthur (who personally delivered the  author from  incarceration).<BR> Ettinger's story is highly recommended as  a vivid window into the world of the doughboy, and a fine  unit history as  well. <br /> (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately ineradicable  feature of the page.

Haunted for the rest of his life by the death and mutilation of his friends; \\"obsessed with telling what I remember of my fallen comrades\\" of Company F, Baker undertook, at the age of 86, to memorialize his buddies \\"before I, too, go West\\". Luckily for us, his memories are rearkably clear, with the names,hometowns, and fate of his friends faithfully recorded, and his combat narrative particularly vivid and compelling.<BR> A printer by trade, and a careful researcher, Baker would have been chagrined to see his occasional faulty recollection go uncorrected in the process of publication of his work, but the minor flaws don't detract much from this interesting memoir and valuable record. <br /> (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately ineradicable feature of the page.

Here is the everything you want to know about America's most charming songbirds.<BR> Their taxonomy and distribution, food and feeding habits, calls and songs (males and females both sing, unlike most species), behavior, breeding and development, and relations with humans (excellent, you will be happy to learn), are comprehensively but succinctly covered, in a highly readable narrative with a generous selection of excellent photos.<BR> Professor Ritchison's work is highly recommended for libraries and students, and a fine gift for that birdwatcher.  <br /> (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately ineradicable feature of the page.

It's all here, from explanations of the naming systems to the role of animals as harbingers, scavengers, and weathervanes in tropical storms. <BR> The information is comprehensive and laid out handily, with tracking maps, easy-to-follow meteorological explanations, and clear drawings and charts to provide all the data anyone is likely to need. There are also useful appendices with safety precautions, a chronology of major hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, and tropical storms, a bibliography, good index, photos, and more.<BR> This is an essential work for residents of vulnerable areas, a fine reference for students and libraries, and a fine gift for that storm buff.

World War Two memoirs are not exactly scarce, but the recollections of a Pulitzer Prize winning historian are bound to excite the interest of even the most jaded military history reader. <BR> Alas, the anticipation surpasses the event. The writing is certainly competent, and occasionally moving, but Ensign Harlan emerges as a conventional young man serving on an unremarkable vessel, with little to distinguish his experiences from thousands of others'. To add irony, several unworthy errors got by the checkers. (The 179th Infantry, for example, is misassigned to the 1st Division).<BR> Harlan's account is engaging, and is a useful view of life on an LCI, but, as the author advises in the Preface: \\"...the reader should remain on guard against my possible lapses\\".<BR>	1998-06-30

Ungar focuses on the human face of immigration in this highly readable but highly slanted survey.<BR> His accounts of the experiences of the new arrivals are illuminating, and occasionally heartrending, but his unfair loading of language becomes tiresome and undermines his position. Opponents of unlimited immigration are repeatedly described as &quot;angry&quot;; they &quot;sneer&quot;, exhibit &quot;tirades&quot; or even a &quot;frenzy&quot; of &quot;vulgar...patter&quot;, while those who support Ungar's views engage in &quot;philosophical musings&quot; or &quot;meekly protest&quot;.<BR> The prospect of large sections of America becoming extensions of the Third World doesn't seem to bother the author, who seems to feel that border crossings cannot and should not be controlled, and &quot;the number officially and legally admitted should more closely approximate the number who actually come each year&quot;. He recommends that American border activities concentrate on drug interdiction and public health measures, but it is unclear to this reviewer how those measures could be implemented in the chaos of an undefended border.<BR> (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an ineradicable feature of the page.
