With 292 customer reviews already listed for this book- I thought- should I bother? But I really have to put in my two cents. I began to like Stephen King again with Hearts in Atlantis and The Green Mile. Gone was the Gore of Cujo and The Tommyknockers. And along comes Dreamcatchers. The gore is back. But somehow after a reprieve from King's more graphic novels, this one works. It's truly gross (yet, thank goodness, humorous). I found myself making weird grunting and groaning sounds on the couch next to my spouse as we read at night- truly overwhelmed with the slimy, bloody, gruesome details King offers.  Ya just gotta wonder how someone's mind can make up stuff like this...Stephen may be normal in some respects but when it comes to his imagination, well...something's just plain nuts about someone who can envision this! Anyway, it's a great summer horror book. Lots of action and great character development. Just don't read it at night unless you're a really sound sleeper.  And warn anyone around you that you may subject them to sudden outbursts of loud yelps of disbelief and nausea.  Have fun and stay out of the woods!	2001-07-27

All I know is that &quot;Endurance&quot; is too soft a word to describe what this crew went through. &quot;Superhuman perseverance&quot;? &quot;Beyond All Odds&quot;? Maybe these sum up this true story more accurately. Readers will never guess how old this book is since it reads like it was written this year. While at times very detailed, especially at the beginning, you will find yourself craving the details as the journey of these adventurers goes on and on. The outcome seems so unlikely that it's apt to whet your appetite for more information about Shackelton and his crew. This particular edition has terrific photos and is worth paying a little more for than the regular paperback. This story turned me into an Antartica nut- buying just about everything I could get my hands on. I've recommended this book to lots of people and everyone thought it was utterly amazing. Don't miss this real life adventure story. It'll leave you shaking your head in disbelief!	2001-07-27

Yes, you can say it's wordy. Yes, the choices characters make may seem unlike the choices you might make. But it is nevertheless a hauntingly beautiful portrait of a family where everyone is dyfunctional but makes it in the end- with the exception of Dad. And frankly, we are ready for a happy ending by the time this book ends. Oates is masterful at character development and motivation. You will feel like you know each of the Mulvaneys personally by the time the book is over. Her words (reminds me of Annie Proulx) paint full-color pictures of people, places, and emotions- so poignant at times I was moved to tears. As difficult and dark are the situations in this book, they were understandable and profound.  If there was one thing I didn't like, it was the portrayal of Christian faith as a form of denying reality instead of as a genuine comfort. But then again, to many, this might just be the case. This is the kind of book you'll want to talk to someone about after you read it. I've never been able to get through another Oates book before this one but I'm going back to try. You'll feel strong emotions towards each of the characters in the book, good or bad, and if you're like me, you'll leave the pages wet when you finish.	2001-07-27

Another terrific book from Terry McMillan and I think that she progressively matures in her work. This book is a gut-busting, gaffaw-out-loud, 2001 look at the complications of family life at middle age. Each chapter of the book is &quot;written&quot; by a different member of Viola's family (including herself of course as the matriarch of the brood). This gives readers an excellent insider's view of each character while giving you the &quot;whole picture&quot; of their dysfunctional selves and relationships. (The good news is that there is a happy ending and hope for functionality). It's McMillan's typical gossipy, lively, trendy, characterizations. You'll recognize yourself (or at least someone you know) in every chapter. A FUN read!!	2001-04-23

Like &quot;berniebo2&quot; (last critic), I have enjoyed Proulx's past writing immensely. The Shipping News and Postcards were wonderful novels. The premise of this book has promise- tracing an accordian's journeys through time and owners, giving the reader a sense of the many cultures within American life. But the bottom line was that the book was too wordy, too long, and not very compelling. I couldn't identify well with the characters even in the abstract. If you want to be exposed to a story with this same fascinating theme- only much cleaner- see &quot;The Red Violin&quot; in VHS or DVD. It, too, traces the path of a musical instrument (a violin)though many owners and countries. However, the pace is much swifter and the characters are more engaging.	2001-01-23

It was predictable (come on guys- &quot;thrilling?&quot;) and shallow. There were typos in the book and the grammar needed a review of it's own. The characters were shallow, too perfectly beautiful or handsome, and it read like a cheap beach novel. This is my first Sandra Brown and will be my last. This book is a lightweight and belongs in &quot;no literary value&quot; section of the bookstore.	2001-01-23

The bride- kidnapped and taken away by bad guys to the big city never to see her child/husband/friend again. And then- bam! We're in San Francisco with a very American main character named Meena who we're supposed to relate to as the child bride. But of course by now, she's educated, wears jeans and jogs, and has a great job in computer software. A Quantum leap into the future. Ms. Kirshner had the right beginning but took the story in the wrong direction. I kept reading the book, mainly because I was very interested in the Indian/Bengali cultural aspects of the story. Also. the &quot;caught between two cultures&quot; idea seemed realistic. The rest of the story ended up being a schmaltzy love story with a predictable ending. Everyone &quot;adjusted&quot; way too easily to the conclusion. Disappointing at best.	2001-01-23

While is presents a slice of life in Russia in the 1800s, the theme of the older generation's impatience and lack of understandng of that of the younger generation is timeless. It is peculiarly Russian, with much of the heated exchanges between the main characters being about the need for social change in the Russian aristocracy of the time. And, as is typical of youthful views, (or of change and revolution perhaps), the two positions are at extreme odds with each other. If you enjoy social and political history, families, and intellectual debate, this is a fine piece of literature.	2001-01-22

Patty, the main character, wants a home, a husband and a baby. When given the opportunity to have all of these, she continually passes up the chance. The reader is never really clear WHY that is- the character's motivation is really weak.  And why she is stuck on Ethan, her now gay, once boyfriend other than the fact that he's beautiful- who knows? Why wouldn't she want to move on? Too much dialogue, not enough character development, very sappy (did she have to throw in the Mother with Alzheimers? What was up with that?). Pass on this Berg. Try Pull of the Moon or some of her other books. Seems like she tried write a book quickly and missed the quality she captured in her other novels.	2001-01-22

But this book was much more than the sum of its parts. Philbrick's research was indisputably thorough and the result is an incredible true account of man's determination and will to survive. Not only is there history here, but there are characters that we come to know and respect. Philbrick was adept at adding a psychological perspective to events and conditions which added depth and insight to the reader's own thoughts and conclusions. A tightly written, gripping account. As others have said, you'll be up all night reading this one. Highly recommend this book.	2001-01-22

For those who didn't like this book, I say you missed the point. Kingsolver once again uses her wonderful talent to &quot;speak&quot; through different characters (as in Poisonwood Bible). In this case, there are three main characters (and many strong supporting characters)- Deanna, Lusa, and Garnett- through whom she spins her tales. Ironically, all of the main characters are fiecely independent people, devoted to nature, who discover their need for human connection. Their stories, while separate and distinct, intersect at the conclusion of the story. The book was fascinating in that Kingsolver can spin multiple stories on multiple levels simultaneously in a stunningly deep and insightful way. (And not just stories about human characters). This book was so rich in thoughts and ideas, I think you will probably need to read it several times to take it all in. It was about procreation and creation, interdependencies and independence in all of nature. She beautifully shows that we humans are very little different from our animal, plant and insect brethren. Her writing was vivid, descriptive, and made nature one could smell, taste, and touch through her words. This book is a monumental achievement. How will she ever top this one?	2001-01-22

This book was interesting from the first paragraph. True to form, Oprah has picked yet another dark story of dysfunctional people. This book was different because there were two main characters- both on a collision course with each other. There were times I didn't care for the characters- that is their actions, thoughts, and motives. This is particularly true of Kathy and Lester.  But like them or not, they were fascinating and unpredictable people. There were times when I didn't like the view Dubus paints of how we treat foreigners- maybe it was too close to the truth to be comfortable. But it was a compelling portrait. This was a real page turner.  This book was shocking at times. I would have never guessed how things were would progress to the the utter chaos of the end of the story. I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished it. I'd recommend it.	2001-01-02

This book left me speechless. I was absolutely dazzled by the prose. It was stunningly beautiful and graphic. (I am especially amazed that the prose is still this good after translation from the original Russian). I don't think I've ever read more creative writing. But the bottom line for me was this- Humbert Humbert is a pedophile- and even though the book wasn't graphic in it's detail, the insinuation was plenty clear. I had a hard time getting beyond this fact- great writing or not. What kind of person was Nabokov to have written this with such perfection? It's not classic erotica- it's simply perversion when you come right down to it. Beautifully written aberrance.	2000-11-15

I bought this book hoping to have an early broad conversation about sexuality with my 9 year old boy and found this book to be too detailed for someone that young. The illustrations are over-simplified and may be good for younger kids, but it doesn't jibe with the text which is more complex and biologically, fact-based. A great book- but I found I have to leave it on the shelf for another year or so. I don't think most 9-year olds will get this stuff yet so I'd advise you to hold off buying this unless you have an exceptionally mature child of this age. I'm sure it will be an excellent reference at 10 or 11.	2000-11-15

This is the story of Nan, a woman turning 50, who suddenly &quot;runs away from home&quot; in order to take stock of her life, her love, what it means to grow older, and what it means to be herself- free of family obligations for the first time in many years. It is beautifully written, very poignant, and probably would not be a book anyone under 45 could appreciate. My immediate reaction was to want to take a &quot;road trip&quot; of my own because it's so easy to identify with Nan's life. That is, how much we women sometimes give up of ourselves- our own dreams- to create a warm and nurturing environment for our spouses and children. And- just how much we may lose of ourselves by playing a supporting role in helping our children and spouses to achieve their dreams. I thought this was an inspirational book and gave me a wonderful sense that 50 could be terrific.	2000-11-15

I had high hopes that this book would expose me to something new and noble about black history. Otis started out okay- I was fascinated with the knowledge of brilliant black doctors and businessmen (and women) who had succeeded beyond the odds. I support getting kids educated and I even understand why early 20th century African Americans felt they had to segregate their kids to succeed. It was important and vital to have built a network of role models for their children. I was cheering on their successes but that cheering stopped rather suddenly.    The book lost my interest when it began to weave a yarn about elitism and racism within a race. Was Otis saying that this was or is effective? Blacks discriminating against black because of skin color? Because of amount of money the family had? Prestige of school or sorority/frat? Did Otis really need to expose this? This is like looking at the rotten side of the dominate white culture in America. Wanting your kids to get ahead is normal and natural, but arrogance is arrogance, regardless of the culture it's in. The book started out interesting, middled into a social register of &quot;who's who in black America&quot; and ended with racism based on just how black you are. Otis struck me as a wannabe in his writing. Not quite up to the upper strata of his race but there were plenty of reminders that he was clearly &quot;connected&quot;. Yuck. Black, white, yellow, or red- who needs this kind of caste system junk.	2000-11-06

The Harafish is the epic novel of the al-Nagi family who rules a particular  alley in Egypt over multiple generations. (The &quot;harafish&quot; refers to the common people of that same alley). The book's chapters each encompass a generation of leadership by some descendant of the original Ashur as-Nagi, a gentle and pure physical giant, filled with pious and spirit-filled humility. His off-spring, and theirs as well, vary widely in their emulation of this great man and their stories are fascinating and quite unique. Each story's characters are vividly painted for the reader and all of the generations their good guys and bad guys. The entire book will captivate the reader and the simplicity of the read will remind you of books you read in childhood. However, the story themes are not to be thought of as childish- but rather as timeless and transcultural. Greed, piety, fidelity, cunning, love, lust, faith, and compassion all rolled together in an easily read documentary of one family's influence on many. An absolute joy to read. Mahfouz is one of my favorites!	2000-11-06

That is, you've made me laugh again until my sides hurt on a topic that one might consider solemn. This is another one of Annie's classic soul-bearing essays (pun intended)where she exposes &quot;everywoman&quot; in her writing. If the reader doesn't mind LaMott meandering through her life through her essays, eventually the reader will see the ties throughout. LaMott uses her everyday experiences and the people she loves to reveal her faith in God as something very attainable and very present in the small things. Her life, as she describes it, shows the very presence of God both through her faith in herself (and she HAS overcome some real addictions) and in other people (forgiving her mother and father, continuing to try relationships, and of course, wonderful Sam- her son). There is so much in this book for everyone- I'm certain that most women in the &quot;fortish&quot; age group (that LaMott is in) will see themselves a hundred times over. It's that fact that makes me love Annie LaMott. She is me. Only she has had the courage to bear her innermost thoughts and neuroticisms, laugh both at and with herself, and she makes me feel like it's terrific to be wierd and imperfect. This book inspires you to think that God can and will help you to pick up the pieces if you just give him a try. Wonderful book. Again.	2000-10-26

Lots of books about stars are trashy, tabloid material. Not so with this book. This book has a story to tell and it's filled with real-life members of a dysfunctional family and their joys and tragedies. I personally love Marvin Gaye's music, but if even if you aren't a fan, there's enough history of music, the music business, and African-American life history from that time period to make this a great book. Lots of detail, but not too much. A real focus on the individuals in Marvin's life who ultimately shaped his life and the events in it--Highly recommend this one.

The main character,Cedric Jennings, well, he should get 6 stars for tenacity alone (as should his mother, Barbara). This was an eye-opening book, especially for someone like myself who lives in a country setting far away from inner-city strife and hardship. Cedric endures the taunts and ostracism of his inner-city high school peers because he is bright, motivated, and interested in learning. (His mother's infleunce should not be underestimated here, nor should Cedric's faith and the support of his church.) He succeeds beyond all odds in getting accepted to Brown University, only to learn that it's very difficult to fit in and be understood there as well. Poor Cedric doesn't seem to fit in anywhere he goes and yet, he &quot;stays the course&quot; in spite of a mulitude of reasons why he should not. What a wonderful triumph and inspriration his story is. I'd highly recommend it- particularly to non-African American readers who most likely don't have clue what it takes to get out of the ghetto- really. This- &quot;just go out and get a job&quot; mentality we &quot;majority&quot; folks spout needs to be blown up. Read this story and you'll see what real inner-city people are up against. It may change the way you view things and may even inspire you to want to do something about the way things are.	2000-10-16

I've never read Allende before so I assumed that maybe the problem was in a translation or something. And then I read the other customer reviews which says that this is simply not her best book. On that, I can't comment. But this was not my favorite either. I was tempted to abandon the book at several points. It got mildly intriguing when the &quot;California gold rush&quot; got underway, and I found this book to take so many bizarre turns, I stuck with it. I think Allende was trying to make too many statements about disjointed social issues and ultimately, her point got lost entirely.

This is one of my favorite books ever and I can't specifically tell you why. It's written from a man's point of view and I am partial to women writing about women. (Once again- like &quot;She's Come Undone&quot;- Lamb is able to write with a very feminine and emotionally appealing quality). It was unusually long yet never got cumbersome or too wordy.  Au contraire, it got more fascinating as the story went on- particularly the &quot;book within a book&quot; story of his grandmother. And it was rather detailed in it's psychoanalytical study of the characters- which can sometimes be too esoteric for the ordinary reader. But somehow, in spite of all these normally &quot;red flags&quot; for me, this book had it &quot;going on&quot; in a big way. I literally couldn't put it down (after many late nights and bloodshot eyes) because the story continues to twist and turn, surprise and shock, and keep you riveted to the very end. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. But I will tell Amazon's prospective readers nothing except- BUY THIS BOOK AND SHARE IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS.	2000-10-13

Young, pregnant girl- abandoned- and living in secret in a Walmart store where she's been dumped by her crumb of a boyfriend. (Admit it, isn't is a great fantasy to think of living in a store and getting to use all the merchandise at your leisure when no one is looking?). And then it got silly. Totally unrealistic. A little too predictable. Some authors can carry off nutty characters but Billie Letts didn't convince me with the people in this story. Novalee Nation is just a little too perfect in her abandonment. Just a little too wounded. The ending is pat and contrived. And then they went ahead and made a movie about this book? I heard that it, too, was pure drivel. Skip it unless it's the only book left in the doctor's office waiting room.	2000-10-12

The people in Lily's life are all eccentric (which makes this book hilarious) and she herself is a bit on the fringe of what anyone would consider normal. In spite of the number of crazy people who seem to come and go in Lily's life, the one constant in her life is love. She seems surrounded by it, even if some of the people supplying the love are on the dysfunctional side of life. I enjoyed this book tremendously. In contrast to &quot;Bee Season&quot;- a similar saga of a young girl growing up in the Bronx in a dysfunctional family- this book was much brighter and more entertaining.

Put it this way,it wasn't so bad that you won't want to finish it, but it wasn't the kind of read you'd find that keeps you up 'til 2 a.m. to finish it. Some of the characters or scenes she describes- I found disjointed- why is this in here?- kind of feeling. I liked it and I didn't like it. So I think I'd give this waitress between a 12-15% tip. (My tip to you is- get it at the library but don't buy it).	2000-10-12

If you just like &quot;happy stories&quot;- don't read this. I, fortunately, was on the beach in the Bahamas when I read this so it perhaps didn't seem so bad. But I have to say, this is one of the darkest books I ever read. I liked it anyway. No, I wouldn't read it again.  I think it may describe more families in America than we'd care to acknowledge. As Thoreau would say, those people &quot;living lives of quiet desparation&quot;.  It was beautifully written- heartfelt. So many people have reviewed this book and seem to have hated it. The intense dislike may mean that this book has evoked remotion.  I think that's worth something in a novel.Give it a shot. It's eerily sad and will take you out of your comfort zone. And, it may make your own world look good by comparison.	2000-10-12

Trudi,the amazing dwarf/woman living a courageous life in Germany during WWII, left an indelible mark on my conscience and heart. It is difficult to understand what it must have been like to be Trudi. But Hegi did a masterful job sharing Trudi's life and struggles with us from her baby days through her adulthood. The book can be very sad, very wistful, and very hard to continue reading, but it is a triumph. A triumph of spirit and hope. A complicated maze of odd characters who struggle together during anything but normal circumstances. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Not for readers who like light stuff. This one will make you work but the rewards are many.	2000-10-12

Not perfect, but the characters are so warm and so easy to &quot;get inside of&quot;, they felt like a familiar blanket. It's seldom that we read a frank, day-to-day picture of a divorced woman's struggle with her everyday life after the &quot;event&quot; has shocked her. Berg captured this beautifully. The changed relationships with your Mother, your kids,your ex, and of course, yourself. All very poignantly captured in this novel. And, the best part is, the book ends with hope and happiness. Sometimes you just need a read like this. This book spurred me on to read more Berg novels. Her style is simple, direct, and easy- with an uncanny ability to get you into her characters as your friends from the git! Good stuff.	2000-10-12

So if you want reality, this probably isn't the right book for you. The &quot;real&quot; story probably would not have such a pat ending.  But the truth is that this book is ripe with vivid,warm, and lush people, situations and sensations. Berg is a splendid writer. I loved each character's realist thoughts,feelings and actions.  And if you're a 40-ish woman, this book will bring back many recollections of your life growing up in the 1960's- from the foods you liked to eat to how people dressed (and behaved) then. A fun, beautiful book. Highly recommend this one. (And it's a fast read too).	2000-10-11

Perhaps  not as exaggerated as Amy and Isabelle, but maybe that's why I liked the  book. It was like a good soap opera- and I've been known to like those too.  The story starts out slowly and builds to a wonderful, shattering  breakthrough for both mother and daughter. Readers will find Isabelle a  little odd- and too extreme to understand at first. Stick with the book and  you'll understand why later. Amy, on the other hand, was the perfect  characterization of a teenager. Says (when she speaks at all) very little  to Mom about what her life is really like, and acts in a very typically  rebellious way. Smoking, skipping school, hangs out with a  &quot;tough&quot; girlfriend,-even necking with her teacher. (But of  course, who could blame her for that- he's the only one in the book who  really showed her any &quot;love&quot; in the story- if that's what it  was). I thought it was a good embellishment on what real life can be like  between mothers and daughters. If the book makes you uncomfortable, maybe  you had a one of those rare, more perfect experiences with your mother than  I did. I liked this book a lot. It got better with every page.	2000-09-14

This was an mildly interesting book written in classic, no-frills Chinese  prose. The characters were deep but only if the reader was willing to do  the analysis of the character motivation themselves. Ha Jin did not assume  his reader would need to have this spelled out for them. There were no  excess words here to describe feelings. His words focused on describing  facts and situations. One really has to look behind the facts for the  emotional parts of the story. I liked that. If you are sympathetic by  nature, you will find the book very deeply touching.  I found it also to be  immensely sad since every character in this book was a victim of  themselves, a victim of the life at that time in China, and a victim of  circumstances. If the reader is not able to be empathetic with the  characters, this book will be utterly boring and may seem pointless. The  morale of the story, and perhaps the biggest downer is- sometimes when you  finally get what you want, it's not what you think it's going to be (a  twist on the old &quot;grass is always greener&quot; concept). Don't let  the rather depressing theme deter you from reading this book if 1) you have  an interest in fine, clean writing and 2)using your brain to intuit the  characters' psyche and motivation doesn't scare you. I would,  however,suggest you read this when you're in pretty good spirits or it may  give you that &quot;so this is all there is in life?&quot; kind of feeling.	2000-09-14

No matter how much you read about the Kennedy's, you have to admit that  they continue to be fascinating and compelling-- probably because they are  REAL and not fiction. Taraborrelli does an admirable job of presenting the  relationships between Ethel, Jackie and Joan within the backdrop of the  times in a succinct and easy to read way. There wasn't a lot of extra  verbage in the book- sentences were short and digestable. Yet the reader  won't be insulted by the easy to read style. In fact, one can often be  critical of historical writers because they get too wordy--trying to cram  in all the relevant dates and times. This book was written from an  emotional/relational point of view and used history as a backdrop. I truly  enjoyed the intimate glimpses of each of these women that Taraborrelli  gives us and he was able to weave it altogether into a simple, yet complex,  tapestry of important and strong lives. Great read for the summer.	2000-09-13

I was FASCINATED by just how hard these  people had to toil in order to stay alive. It was depressing and curiously  fascinating. Watching the main characters grovel with nothing to their  names and getting swindled out of the little they had... Floods, sick  animals, farm life- ugh. Guess I'm a city gal. But it was a interesting  voyeuristic look at someone else's trials. There was hope and love in  there, but not at the magnitude I thought these folks deserved for all of  their hardships.

Ruth, the heroine and narrator of the book, is one of the strongest  (if not also strangest) women I've met in literature. Her story has stayed  with me as if I read the book yesterday. There are very few books which,  using only the scantest number of words, can paint pictures of people,  times, and actions which you can see, smell and taste with your senses.  This book was SO different from &quot;Map of the World&quot;, I wouldn't  have recognized Hamilton as the author. Please read this book. It has a lot  to say.	2000-09-13

The story that  was meant to draw you in with one woman's conflicting feelings about her  past (and maybe her present), rang hollow. I can't tell you what was  missing but something was. Trite? Same old plot new characters? I'm not  sure. But it was a book that made no sense to me. The main character seemed  to have the perfect man in her life. Thoughts about an affair? Why? And  then to get righteous about something that possibly happened in the past,go  to the police, and jeopardize that great life? Well- guess you'll just have  to decide for yourself. There just wasn't enough MOTIVE for any of the  actions the main character took. I read this before Oprah made it one of  her books. When I saw that she endorsed it, I wondered why. I usually like  her choices. Not this one.	2000-09-08

I'm glad my son was 9 when I read this book. While I loved Annie Lamott as  the person she presented herself as(she was so HONEST!),the book took me  back to those dark times of new motherhood. The book was hilarious but the  undercurrent of self-doubts and mixed feelings towards your baby- while  real- I think I'd rather forget. I thought this was a simple book about a  very complex REAL person. I loved her emotions, her honesty, her very  humorous writing style, and her ability to be &quot;every woman&quot;. It  may be realistic but I'm not sure it's a must read for new or expecting  parents! I loved it but at the same time found it to be disturbing. (Maybe  that's the point!)

And then the  plot goes down (it never really left the ground). This book was really  strange. Esoteric. Dark and depressing. Ancient Hebrew chanting rituals.  Hare Krishnas. Kleptomananics. All in the same house and unaware of each  others idiosyncracies. It was just too far out. I love the bizarre but this  one I could not recommend.

A slice of life in Egypt that most of us in the  Western World will never understand or see. The motivations of the  characters, their situations and values, all foreign but compelling. This  was my first Mahfouz (certainly won't be my last) and I loved his writing  style. Artful, realistic and fairly easy to breeze through considering it  was a translation (by Mahfouz himself, I think). I finished the book and  felt that I had known the characters.

The movie trailers and the other  reviewers have already told you what this book is about if you haven't read  it yet. What it truly is is a wonderfully spun story with rich characters  and a touch of magic (or spirit or the supernatural- choose your term).  This book had me in tears, laughing in delight, cheering for the good guys  and having visceral reactions to the bad guys. In many ways, it's a great  American novel. Bravo, Mr. King.

If you've read the other reviews of this book, you already know that  Martin Blom was &quot;insulted&quot; by a gunshot wound, leaving him blind  by day but able to see nocturnally. This book is dark (pun intended) yet  fun and witty. Very unreal but very real at the same time. Rupert Thomson  is a masterful writer. He creates fascinating (albeit strange) characters  more bizarre than you've read about before. The story twists and turns and  ends up where you wouldn't expect it to (which I loved). He writes in a  style that's  easy to read and creates strong visuals of people and places  and emotions. (I'm rather surprised by the other reviews that didn't like  his character development or his writing style). It's erotic, eerie,  off-beat and a really good read. Very cool- I'll be recommending it to my  friends who like the unusual.	2000-09-08

She tends to loose me  in her need to be artful in her writing. If this is her &quot;less  mature&quot; writing, I prefer it. It was a really nicely written book  about many sad characters. It was not a happy book in any way. It was a  portrait of a time and of the people caught in that time. It was a very  dark story- sober by design- and not something one would read at the beach  for a little entertainment. If you are interested in issues that faced the  black community then(and maybe still), it probably has some historical  significance. A thought provoking, but clearly-not-for-everyone read.	2000-09-08

A very SOLID book with lots to say, Mosher has created a wonderful novel  about a moment in time in a small town in Vermont. It exposes small town  thinking and it's affects on a young teenage boy and his life from that  point on. Lots of action, suspense, warm and crusty Vermont characters,  baseball and apple pie for everyone. But the book has an important edge  beneath the veneer of small town life. This could be about any town  anywhere in America. It exposes the underside of people- the dark side- of  prejudice and clannishness. An important book. One you won't forget easily.	2000-09-08

A very tight book- well conceived and very  emotionally captivating. The book is divided into the three sections of  very different lengths. The first section is terrific. The second section  was interesting but I wasn't sure where it was going (not as riveting as  Section 1). And then came the tidy little ending- the last section- which  pulled all of those little loose ends together adding a poignant twist  that'll bring a tear to your eye.

It's simplistic writing wasn't my favorite- it seemed  as if it was written for young adults. But by the time I finished the book,  I realized that simplicity was the main theme of the book. The writing  style was consistent with the entire message. I think it's very hard for  modern day Christians to understand Jesus, the man, and how a man today  with His values might live/act every day. Even though it is fiction, this  book was very helpful in allowing me to understand the intention Jesus has  for us in this day and how he expects us to live our lives. The book only  failed in that it wasn't realistic at the end where Joshua is called to  stand before the Pope. I realize that the author was attempting to make a  point and allow Joshua to really test his faith principles with the Earthly  pontiff, but it seemed too far fetched. I was right with the story until  that last section. I still think it's a worthwhile read. I have personally  reflected on it many times since I finished it.	2000-09-08
