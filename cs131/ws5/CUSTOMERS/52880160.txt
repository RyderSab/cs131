I liked this second book of The Genesis Trilogy very much, but I liked the first one (The Heavens Before) a lot better. I suppose because there's a lot less material (Biblical-wise, anyway) to work with. And I suppose I like it less because it pretty much starts up a whole new storyline (the Tower of Babel) that covers just this and the third book.  <br /> <br />However, it's still a great read! Once again Kacy Barnett-Gramckow gives lots and lots of original ideas and situations and characters.	2005-08-02

I really picked this book up at random, not really realizing what I had found. And was I surprised! I was hooked from the opening sentences. I finished it in about three days.  <br /> <br />I was greatly impressed by the author's theory about a warm world with a glowing pink sky, animals who know no fear of humans and vice versa, and what society might have been like before the Flood. She follows the Bible in every way, yet fills in the gaps between verses.    <br /> <br />This book is totally original and exciting, and worth the cover price! It has humor, romance, excitement, action, orginality and above all, a love for the Creator.	2005-08-02

This book finishes the story of the Tower of Babel and it's results. <br /> <br />But I'm sorry to say it's not quite as interesting as the first book of the three. I felt like I didn't get to know Shoshannah very well, nor did she really do anything terribly interesting or exciting during her captivity in the Great City. But considering how we know little about the customs or people of the time, the author did a lovely job. But the ending is exciting, though! It ends the trilogy on a great note with the events of, the confusion of languages the scattering of nations, and the 'passing the torch' on to Abram.   <br /> <br />I only wish I knew 2 things---where Ra-Anan's tribe ended up, and what those mysterious sunstones were! lol	2005-08-02

We have to older version which is just fine for most things however, I'm ordering the newer anyway for the updates. <br /> <br />The ONLY negative I found was that some of the intros for the doctors in each remedy were so long, they took up most of the remedy so really, without the doc intro's the book would be smaller which is good (less bulky in the middle of the night)!  Maybe the writers can mention the docs in an intro chapter because some of them are mentioned twice or more in the book.  Make since? <br /> <br />GREAT BOOK THOUGH!	2004-12-21

Pastor Warren really makes you think about life differently - God's way.  He uses scripture after scripture to back up what he says and doesn't take them out of context.  VERY understandable and readable.  For everyone!<br />God bless you Pastor Warren and THANK YOU for allowing God to use you in this wonderful endeavor!<br />Leslie Harris :)	2003-10-18

Our family was stuck in a rut of the same old dinners, frozen dinners, too much eating out... SO I decided to try this!  I had the book for about a year but never touched it... Oh I wish I had!  There's always something good to look forward to at meal time now.  Our daughter is a bit on the picky side, as all kids (AND adults) can be, but she even liked a few of the recipes!  Here's my synopsis....<br />PRAISES:<BR>WONDERFUL RECIPES<BR>Preparing for dinner is a snap<BR>Cleaning is easier<BR>Saves time<br />Healthier eating<BR>Saves money in the long run because you aren't eating out as much!<BR>Flexible recipes (e.i. supstitute one meat for another)<BR>3 two-week plans (one is low-fat)<BR>2 month plans<BR>Very well organized<BR>Step by step instructions<BR>Has shopping lists already made for you<BR>Gives instructions on organizing to make up your own plans!<BR>Easy directions!<br />Semi-negatives: unless you have most of the spices, beginning will cost a little more, some of the recipes need a little tweeking (minor things), unless you have help, stick to the 2 weekers because the month long ones are tough (but good!  I may try it one day myself!)<br />OVERALL:  LOVE IT!  We will be eating a lot of the recipes for years to come!  They're great!  It's even improved my cooking skills!<br />Get it and try it if you're stuck in a rut or in fast food lines or just need new recipes to spice up your own meals!

She had low confidence in her spelling ability.  The first day we started this program--WHAM-- what a difference!  She saw that she could spell!  She  loves the 10 step study pages.  Also, she likes that you only have to study  the words she missed and not 10 to 20 words a day for a test at the end of  the week.  In this program, you take daily tests lasting just 5 minutes.   Then the missed spelled words are repeated the next day.<br /> I'm looking now  for the activity cards.  This program is wonderful for homeschoolers and  anyone wanting to improve their childs spelling ability.<br />The author of  the book recommends this for grades 3 to 12, but used it with her 5 year  old granddaughter.  We are using it with our 7 year old who is an advanced  reader.  Also this 10 step word study helps her with independent learning.   She focuses better with steps.<br />They have their own website if you want  more info.  Just type Spelling Power into your search engine.	2000-06-09

I like how they how it organized by size and type of bird (all  the water birds are together, all the birds of prey, all the smaller  Fenches and Sparrows, etc.  Easy to find that way.  There was one bird  drawing that was more colorful than the actual bird we saw.  This might be  due to the fact that they don't picture every type of one kind of bird.
