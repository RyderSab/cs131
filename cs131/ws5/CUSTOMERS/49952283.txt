Books	5	26	31	N	N	Very Accurate	I want address the VERY NAIVE and typical comments of the \\"doctor\\" who posted what he did earlier. Anyone who reads this book and has his typical high society yuppie left wing opinions will get their lunch eaten out there. <br />This is the most primitive environment in the U.S. and worse than prison unless you're in a security risk unit. That's about the best way to describe this life. Whatever you would figure life is like in prison it's like that on the streets except survival is often harder because there's so many rules and hawks that can prey on you. Ask anyone who is perfectly happy in jail where they lived before there........they'll tell you the street. <br />If you're an outsider and being white and from a upper middle class background not hip to the street you're going to be a serious target, not only are you easy prey but you represent (at your past) everything these people wish they had and dispise. A lot of the ____ is racial, like I mentioned earlier......it's a very primitive life. I'm from Texas and if you're a junkie and hang in a low income neighborhood most likely it will be a black community. This itself opens up trouble right off. You stick out, and I'm not racist and don't want to generalize either but any person's opinion of you right or wrong is your reality. If some black guys don't like you because you're white then you better know how to avoid trouble. Also on the street EVERYTHING is profiling and generalizations because your whole life is vunerable and you have to live it on gambles and vibes, the only way to do that is use profiling type tools. You don't have time to get someone's info as person or hire them for a job, this is YOUR LIFE AT RISK. You see someone who looks like a threat you'll have to know when to run in seconds flat.<br />For all the people against profiling and generalizing that's fine.........judging or treating people based on that is rude, considering in primitive environments is wise. People from the upperclass just don't understand. Another tip, the streets of cities like San Fran and Seattle are much different than most because the whole district only allows people to live there easily with money. It's their \\"liberal way\\" of keeping the \\"gang members\\" out. That's usually what minorities are referred to by their mannerly society. They don't have AS MANY predators lurking in large numbers in those cities and one or two others because cost is sky high. Most cities like LA, NYC, and others not even as big have many more concrete jungles. <br />I wrote this because yuppies have NO PERSPECTIVE on issues described in this book unless they've been there. They're way too sheltered to know. I don't care how high someone's IQ is or \\"family money\\" they have which is why most got to go to medical/law school in the first place, if you haven't been in that environment then you don't know.	2003-08-14

Therefore, it totally killed the story midway through the book for me.<BR>It's sad to think people are entertained by such a weak job, almost like the movie Face Off or something.

This book would've even been much better if it could be written now.<br />I would love to see the character's view points on women, sex, etc.	2003-02-06

The reason I write this is because many of these techniques are very old. This man did great things in the dog world, many things have changed since but this method was the biggest thing to break the surface of protection dog training I feel.<br />There are some things in it that can be dangerous and will certainly make your dog a bit too nervous. I don't recommend people using it but many people cannot find a protection dog trainer that knows what they are doing. This works and will always continue to do so. That is why you always see someone using these methods.<br />Personally I think all of the methods work but if you have to use table training for protection or whip a dog t work then your dog might not be one that should be training for Protection work in the first place.<br />I give it 5 stars because of the accomplishments this man did for the working dog community as well as general dog training. For the time it was used it was the best. Things always improve and to discredit this man and his training would be like comparing machines of today to those of 40 years ago.<br />Again I don't recommend this type of training but most protection dog books I think are totally ludicruous.

I was of course glad to see the ending, with who died in the end. I felt they deserved it quite frankly. But I was still very shocked to see how she openly admitted the other stuff which she should've been punished for. Of course at her age, I don't think she would've done anymore than three years extra.<br />What this girl and her friend endured was one of the worst stories I've ever heard, and I feel very sorry for them both. Seeing how young they are though which couldn't be more than 25 or 26 give or take a few years I can't but believe they'll kill again sooner or later. I can't see how she didn't do what she did. I would've been very interested to know her grandparents complete background on both sides even though it wouldn't be possible.<br />The world is a cruel place, sooner or later someone will push the right buttons and people like this will kill again. There's just too much show of violence at such an early age, some unprovoked. The activities that she's involved in now will just help speed up this. (Witchcraft and other nonsense, sorry just my opinion. I'm don't mean to judge) I think her friend is much more dangerous and disturbed, and she's more guilty in many ways too with her age and her whacked out views on reality. <br />I'm sorry to not show sympathy if that's how it seems. I know she went through ALOT. I would've even liked to have seen her grandfather get his as well for his attitude. But that doesn't make it right. Charles Manson, and many others were treated like animals at a very early age, you still can't release them in public like that.<br />Like I said, I just can't help but think she won't kill again. There's far too much time for her to act out. She's beat the system too often and it probably made her feel more superior. It'll be interesting to see if anything ever happens again from this case, if we get know about it that is. Since everything is totally confidential I don't know what we'd hear but that's very bizarre with the other murders she committed with the other friends of hers. Maybe there will be a sequel. I hope she'll do ok, but I doubt it.	2002-10-07

This whole country, as well as Tojo were the most cruel, racist, and inhumane people known to man. I hate to totally lay all this blame on Tojo himself but rather the whole country of Japan. Many people aren't even allowed to go into their chatrooms on the net as I type this review. Many times when visiting their country you can try to eat or go into a bar and if you are white they will immediately intervene telling you \\"This is a Private Club\\" and not let you enter because of the color of your skin. I'm not making this up. To me they seem to be the most racist people in the world. Of course this is rarely pointed out on television.<br />In my opinion the Nazis got many of their codes and policies from these people. I think the Nazis were highly influenced in how in conducted things in relation to the Japanese people.<br />In a nutshell I don't see why people like this are considered any different than Hitler. Of course, the Jewish community was unaffected by the Japanese so therefore you don't hear about it as often. (Just my opinion)<br />In the eyes of the Japanese, you're either one of two things, Japanese or Gai-Jin meaning that you're nothing more than a barbarian. That crosses all religions, races, and genders.<br />The things this country beliefs are shocking, and the public should be made aware of how they are.<br />For some unknown reason in today's society, a group of people who're not caucasian are often made to look a bit romantic and intriguing when they display this form of violence. Yet Germany because they're like you and I are considered monsters. This troubles me. There's not a difference.<br />I rate this book 5 stars, yes it's very good, but it's very shocking to me how people don't consider this culture barbaric and cruel. The Jewish community of all people usually seem very in awe of the Asian culture while these people are simply the most racist people on the planet. This is not just because we're different than the east, the Japanese feel the same way about their surrounding countries. As far as the Japanese society is concerned, if you're Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, etc., you might has well be smothered at birth.<br />These people fight dogs, fight horses, beat up their women and children, pedophilia was legal until 95. If any country in this world were similar in their behavior and IF they were white, they'd be shunned by everyone.<br />I know this is off subject, and I have no problem with the author. However many people who want to study this culture and read many books about Japan need to be aware of the their REAL culture and history. There's not much talk about it.<br />This man isn't too far from the modern day Japense citizen. Many will feel I'm wrong but I feel this needs to be put out there for people looking to learn the history of Japan.re while these people are simply the most racist people on the planet.

In fact it's nearly worked for me 100%. <BR>All my life I was a nice guy. I was raised in a traditional family household. I grew up believing that people were to be treated as you would like them to treat you. In a perfect world this would be great, but clearly it's not a perfect world. <BR>I feel most of the statements and opinions the author states here are true. If statistical facts could be shown in these areas, then I think it would definitely make people have stronger reasons for feeling this way. <BR>We live and then we die. It's a cruel world and there's no mercy. In the end it's about getting what you want, and saving your own a--. If for some reason these things don't appeal to you, then don't worry about it. I feel though that if you follow this type of method it does work. No matter who one is within reason will be more successful with this information, compared to someone without it.<BR>I think most women generally like to be treated [badly]. It gives them some form of drama that they can attempt to solve while living through life.<BR>What appalls me even more are women's reactions to these types of books. I never realized it until after reading this book but most magazines women read have many articles on how to manipulate \\"their man.\\" I also think women write books dealing with these forms of topics in much greater volume than to our gender as well.	2001-11-01

I say this mainly because of the fact that it addresses much more information about the psychology of the breed itself than the typical text out there. It speaks a great deal about protection work rather than some I've read. It discusses many different opinions/options concerning people that like showing dogs and people that don't. I was very glad to see it talked about sport such as Schutzhund, and where to explore those avenues if you are more inclined with that. It gives information about the U.D.C. as well. I think the book gives much more than the usual BS that is discussed about dogs in general. <br />Thank god there are some authors out there that feel a need to discuss the breed characteristics, unlike the large portion that like making a quick buck. This book at least talks about other topics if that's not what your into. Like other reviewers I like reading the different views of other countries about the breed. I was very happy to see the information about the difference between German and US standards about the breed. <br />I personally think showing any dog that performs some form of working task cripples the breed if can't keep the same breed instinct it was breed to do, but that's just my opinion. Clearly I'm more into the German working standards, so therefore I greatly appreciate this book. I'm also greatly interested in reading some German books about this breed if I can find one translated. If any readers of this are into the same views as myself than they might want to as well.<br />I don't agree with everything the authors think, but I at least like what they discussed. German Dobermanns are no longer what they used to be, and many of the breed regulations are no longer. I don't like the UDC as much as I like the SDA. It's too bad they didn't discuss much more about sport trials for protection work, such as The Ring sports and KNPV. There are still some good kennels out there, but not many.	2001-10-10

I think this book is excellent for pictures and basic dog knowledge. There is some information about all aspects of this breed, which I think is good.  I don't think though that it is ideal book for people wanting to understand GSD psychology, as well as Schutzhund work. It does cover these areas to some degree as I mentioned, but not near enough. <br />I would recommend this book to people that like GSDs, and perhaps are interested in showing them. It has superb photographs and is nice to own for those purposes.  I personally think though that showing dogs is primarily what cripple the breed characteristics and temperament that predominantly are used for any form of working task.  If one wants to show their dog, then they should at least qualify in certain events that protect the breed's instinct and it's designed abilities. Many people feel that this is very unnecessary, especially when it comes to training them to protect.  My opinion to people who want a pet is to get just that. I don't feel GSDs or any other working canines should be bred for any other reason than their intended purpose whether that is conformation work or hunting wild game.<br />I also wish that books designed for specific breeds would discuss things about their behavior rather than basic dog maintenance and other common knowledge topics that are discussed in books on dogs in general.	2001-10-10
