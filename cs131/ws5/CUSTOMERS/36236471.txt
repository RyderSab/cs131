For this reason, I have spent much of the last 26 years acquiring and reading various English language translations, with the goal of understanding and assisting those with a faith different than my own.  I have read several books that compare many of the same translations that Professor BeDuhn compares in Truth In Translation.  However helpful such books have been, when it comes to the subject of the New World translation they march in lockstep in what I consider unbridled and unreasoned criticism.<br /><br />Truth In Translation has broken through a significant barrier of bias to provide what I believe is the first unbiased look at Bible translations I have ever had the pleasure to read.  It appears that Professor BeDuhn, as an independent academic, is not obliged to provide the \\"red meat\\" that the authors of similar works, fettered to the religious institutions they represent, feel obligated to provide to their own parochial audiences.  The result is a true breath of fresh air that simultaneously challenged my own views.<br /><br />The premise of the book is that the world of Bible translation is not the academically pure environment based on sound and consistent principles that one would hope for.  Instead, the typical Bible translator/translation committee has come into this world as a devotee of a particular religious institution with his own defined world view in place.  In addition, their work is typically sponsored by a denomination or a group of denominations with a specified outcome already in place.  It is not difficult to see that such a world, rife with conflicts of interest, is not the ideal soil in which to grow an independent and accurate translation of the Scriptures.  As a result, EVERY translation that Professor BeDuhn examines in his work is guilty of bias to a greater or lesser degree.<br /><br />What Professor BeDuhn has done is focused his examination of nine different Bible translations in areas in which there is a theological premium, such as John 1:1; 8:58; Colossians 1:15-20; Hebrews 1:8 and many others.  He then applies the standard that should be applied in any case of translating the NT - what does the Greek text actually say?  And, if there is room for translations to read differently, which translation is the most probable.  Throughout this examination, Professor BeDuhn maintains the bright line between translation and interpretation, a line that is amazingly easy to unknowingly cross.  The result is nothing short of amazing, namely, the most oft maligned English translation of the 20th century (NW) turns out to be one of two translations (the NAB is the other) demonstrating the greatest freedom from bias.  The education I received in this consideration greatly exceeded the purchase price of the book.<br /><br />Lest anyone think that Professor BeDuhn is nothing more that a Jehovah's witness apologist, he saves some of his harshest criticism for the NW translation in his appendix, which deals exclusively with the \\"peculiar characteristic\\" of including the divine name Jehovah in the body of the NT translation.  It is difficult to deny the logic he uses in citing the reasons why this translation, while well intentioned, is inappropriate if the goal is the accurate translation of the extant Greek manuscripts.  Thank you Professor BeDuhn.  I eagerly await your further works.is examination of nine different Bible translations in areas in which there is a theological premium, such as John 1:1; 8:58; Colossians 1:15-20; Hebrews 1:8 and many others.

It is an awe inspiring feeling to know that you can hold in your hands THE authority concerning our vocabulary.  This is a marvelous tool that I have thoroughly enjoyed.  That said, there are two compromises you must be willing to make to enjoy this dictionary.  First, the typeface is incredibly small.  I have better than 20/20 vision and it is still difficult for me to read the largest of print in the main body of the text unaided.  As a side, the accompanying magnifier is wholly inadequate.  Be prepared to invest in a good magnifying glass with 3x or greater magnification.  Second, the size of the book is quite large.  This is not a book you will be paging through on your lap on a lazy afternoon.  If you can get past these hurdles, there is not a better dictionary for our language.  And Amazon is, hands down, the best place to purchase this.  I received my dictionary in 2 days for $100 less than the nearest competitor.	2005-03-09

Most importantly, it walks a person through each of the moving parts of a plan and explains in detail the administrative processes involved in each component.<br />I work as a consultant for several plan sponsors.

Most find a translation they like and stick with it, without going into the deeper meaning or looking for alternate renderings. It is for this reason that I can not recommend in good conscience this paraphrase. The textual liberties that are taken are to be expected, after all this is a paraphrase not a translation. However, the liberties taken in the footnotes are even more egregious. Take as an example the footnote to Ecclesiastes 9: 5, 10. It there states &quot;these words are Solomon's discouraged opinion and do not reflect the truth of God's word on this point.&quot; What right does a translator or paraphraser have to simply write off passages of the Bible that conflict with their doctrine? Within the text itself, there are similar examples -<br />Job 1:4 has Job's sons celebrating their birthdays, something never even considered by the ancient Jews and certainly not an accurate rendering of the original text.<br />Acts 15:29 states that Gentiles who turn to God must obey our Jewish laws. This is exactly the opposite of the decision of that group, namely that the Mosaic Law not be imposed as a burden on these newly converted Gentiles.<br />I could go on, but the point is made. This is a book with an agenda, an agenda that takes little note of faithfulness to the original meaning of the text.	2004-01-21

Can anyone tell me why the average Catholic does not know what their own church teaches regarding what The Catholic Encyclopedia calls \\"the central doctrine of the Christian religion\\"?<br />\\"The formulation of one God in three persons was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century.  But it is precisely this formulation that has first claim to the title the Trinitarian dogma.  Among the Apostolic Fathers, there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective.\\"  New CATHOLIC Encyclopedia (1967) Vol. XIV, p. 299<br />\\"The majority of NT texts reveal God's spirit as something, not someone; this is especially seen in the paralellism between the spirit and the power of God.\\"  ibid p. 296<br />\\"There is the recognition on the part of exegetes and Biblical theologians, including a constantly growing number of Roman Catholics, that one should not speak of Trinitarianism in the New Testament without serious qualification.  There is also the closely parallel recognition on the part of historians of dogma and systematic theologians that when one does speak of an unqualified Trinitarianism, one has moved from the period of Christian origins to, say, the last quadrant of the 4th century.\\"  ibid p. 295<br />These are the statements, not of Jehovah's witnesses, but of the Catholic church.  Does not a serious discussion of this issue warrant honest presentation of both sides of the argument, and at least an acknowlegement of what YOUR OWN CHURCH actually teaches regarding this subject?	2004-01-12

As one of Jehovah's witnesses, I have had hundreds of discussions with people concerning the Trinity.  I was familiar with many of the arguments presented in the book, however I was surprised with some new ones I had not heard before.  Finding these new points, and the scriptural explanations that ensued, was worth the purchase price of the book.<br />However, my one concern with this book and its author is what is the motivation in undertaking such an exhaustive and time consuming project such as this.  If the reviewers make up a typical sample of the book's readership, then one thing that is evident is that minds are not being changed.  Those in favor of the Trinity throw up their time honored, albeit erroneous, defenses.  At the same time JW's and those sympathetic to them write in praise of the book's scriptural approach.  The truth concerning Jesus' relationship to his Father is so crystal clear in the Scriptures, and the arguments to refute this truth so contorted, that one wonders why one would target such an audience in the first place.  Winning arguments with a trinitarian - easy.  Spending precious dedicated time and resources in an efficacious manner - difficult.	2003-12-06

Yet, I dare say that it is perhaps the least understood, and, as is evident in the reviews, most maligned book in history.  Why?  Perhaps the fact that it has been coopted by religions claiming to represent it and it's author while carrying out some of the greatest atrocities in the history of humanity.<br />So why should you consider the Bible at all?  There are several compelling reasons that I chose to do so, some of which I hope you consider - First, prophetic content.  Time and again the Bible provided and continues to provide detailed information regarding future events.  For example, consider the naming of Cyrus as the conqueror of Babylon some 200 years before the event in Isaiah 44:24 - 45:4.  Second, scientific accuracy.  Although this was not the primary purpose of the scriptures, it proves itself accurate in areas where it does touch on science.  Take for example the portrayal of a spherical earth in Isaiah 40:22.  Or the portrayal of an earth without support (versus the prevailing theories of the time) in Job 26:7.  Third, consider that no other book has undergone the attempts to exterminate it to the extent the Bible has.  Interestingly enough, many of these attempts were carried out by the clergy of various religions.  Fourth, the fact that the Bible we have today is essentially that which was written by the original authors.  This was done through painstaking efforts to ensure faithful textual transmission not found to such an extent in any other book.  Finally, and I must admit somewhat subjectively, is the power the Bible exerts to change lives for the better.  I have literally witnesses hundreds of occasions where an individuals life has been transformed by the power of applying Bible principles in their lives.<br />It is the easy course to dismiss something out of hand without being aware of the full facts.

Who would write such heresy?  Surely those Jehovah's witnesses have gone too far this time.  This quote is from &quot;Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine&quot; written by CARDINAL John Henry Newman.<br />This is where the hypocrisy of this book and others of its ilk come to the fore.  The facts are that almost everything Jehovah's witnesses teach Catholics regarding the pagan origin of church teachings can be substantiated by the reference works of the Catholic Church.  The problem is these reference works are not available to or are unknown to the average Catholic; not unlike the circumstances regarding the Bible itself for hundreds of years.  All the witnesses need do is point these out and allow an individual's conscience to do the rest.<br />The author is right about one thing - there is an appalling lack of knowledge on the part of most Catholics regarding the Bible as well as the teachings of their church.  In most cases, the individual believer is not to be faulted for this.  The systemic design of the Church is one that does not encourage inquiry, nor is the backing of the Bible as the ultimate authority sought in the teaching of Church doctrine.  When this is pointed out, and the person realizes for the first time in their lives that &quot;they have been paying out money for what is not bread&quot; (Isaiah 55:2) then the emotional reaction the author cites in the beginning of the book is understandable.<br />One final thing that can not be left unanswered is the accusation that Jehovah's witnesses are trained to view non-witness relatives as, in the words of the author, &quot;evil and run by the Devil&quot;.  I have been one of Jehovah's witnesses for over 20 years.  Recently my sister converted to Catholicism.  However, our family ties remain, and for that matter are closer now than in the past.

This is another well-written, highly informative book in the series regarding finance and investing. I often conduct seminars on the subject of investing, specifically in retirement accounts, and borrow heavily from the advice and explanations provided in this book. Although the subject matter demands more complexity, and therefore more attention, than the other For Dummies books, it is excellent for those willing to take the extra time. I personally learned a great deal regarding individual stock selection by learning how to understand a company's financial statements. As with any other For Dummies book, you can easily decide how deep you want to go on any given subject.<br />I feel this book is especially relevant in an environment such as today, where many have equated investing with gambling. This statement may be true, if you don't understand the rules.

This book is one of the most valuable resources I have ever seen in helping the average person get control of their financial lives.  Applying its principles will pay immediate as well as long-lasting rewards.	2003-07-30

It was my feeling when I initially wrote my review that this served to detract from the larger issues with which Jehovah's witnesses are well versed.<br /><br />Upon further reflection, due in great part to an e-mail discussion with a friend, I have reevaluated my position regarding this.  Yes, this book is very introspective, and this certainly does not appeal to my more analytic taste.  However, \\"wisdom is proved righteous by its works\\", and I can not disregard the collective good that has been accomplished by the telling of Simone Liebster's very personal story.<br /><br />So, my apologies to anyone offended by my previous review.  And if my review negatively influenced a buying decision on your part, I sincerely hope that you will reconsider your decision.	2003-07-11

This was the very first book I read cover to cover.  This is a wonderful book if your child prefers leggos to video games.  It's not for everyone, but if your child is in the second or third grade, this book could set them on a lifelong voyage of inquisitiveness and discovery.	2003-07-07

This book can only begin to explain the genius involved in the designs I have seen.  I have stayed in a home of Mr. Geller's design which was absolutely remarkable in its use of open space while still allowing for privacy in a home that at the time was shared by 7 people.<br />I am thrilled that this book finally gives some long overdue credit to one of the pioneers of modern residential architecture.	2003-07-03

What this book reveals is that in the church's early days stood a group of unprincipled, ambitious, power hungry men so deeply entrenched in political intrigue as to be unrecognizable as \\"Christians\\" in the biblical sense.  It was the decisions of this group that established much of the doctrinal foundations of Christendom.<br />There are several things that make this book particularly appealing.  First, the author's Jewish heritage assures me he \\"doesn't have a horse in this race\\".  He is completely dispassionate in his examination of this portion of church history; he has no preconceived ideas to prove.  He also provides a rich historical context that enables the reader to discern the ever-present political considerations underlying the moves of the factions involved.  I also appreciated his brief but poignant reference to the influence of Greek philosophy at this time, particularly among the Alexandrine branch of the church.  There are myriad other points as well, which the confines of this space do not allow for.<br />Both the Jewish and Christian scriptures proclaim the truth that good fruitage can not be produced by a rotten tree.  This book, above all else, demonstrates the spiritual rot that had taken hold among those claiming to be Christian.  Let the reader decide if God would approve the fruitage this tree produced.	2003-06-16

I have made it a point to read anything I could regarding the unprecedented series of Supreme Court decisions in the late 1930's and early 1940's brought about by the activities of, and opposition to, Jehovah's witnesses. This is by far the most enlightening of these works, for several reasons.  First, the author has thoroughly researched this work and included a great deal of information regarding the often ignored decisions of the lower courts.  In many cases the eloquence of the lower courts and their grasp of the constitutional issues involved surpassed that of the majority of the Supreme Court.  Second, the role of those courageous enough to champion the witnesses' civil rights was given a prominence I have not seen in other works.  The ACLU, certain liberal clergymen, and the editorials of the Christian Century were given a prominence that has been downplayed or ignored in other works.  In addition, the brilliance of the witnesses' legal team, Hayden Covington in particular, in orchestrating their strategy is acknowledged.  Third is the author's uncomfortableness with, and in some cases dislike of, the teachings and practices of Jehovah's witnesses.  Although I found some of the comments regarding the witnesses unnecessary (weird, odd, obstreperous, etc.), it made his acknowledgement of the witnesses contributions to freedom in this country all the more meaningful.  Finally, the role that this series of decisions played in shaping the Supreme Court for its role as the guardian of civil liberties in the 1950's and 60's is explained in a way that makes me swell with pride to be a part of the group that helped to guarantee the freedoms that at one time in the not too distant past were in danger of being suppressed.	2003-05-23

If you weren't aware of Michael Servetus, then 99.9% of the population are your brethren.  This book explores not only his theological genius, but also examines his invaluable contributions in fields as widely varied as medicine and cartography.  His long lasting impact on our political and religious life is also explained in fascinating (and well documented) detail.  The authors are gifted historians.<br />It is this strength that also becomes the sole weakness of the book.  The authors endeavor to capture the full historical context of the world in which Servetus lived.  However, too much marginally relevant context is introduced, which in some cases served to detract from an otherwise great read.	2003-05-23
