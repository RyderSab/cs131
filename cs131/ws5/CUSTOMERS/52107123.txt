This book is not exactly a biography, but a collection of stories that are part biography, part homage, and above all, an expression of heartfelt love towards the man from the people in his life.<br />The stories are inspired by a series of Conversations with Cary Grant that were a one-man evening show where Mr. Grant essentially held a two hour QA session for an enthralled audience.  Since Mr. Grant was adamantly averse to an autobiography, the woman behind the idea for the one-man show, Nancy Nelson, decided to embark on this project to give remembrance to this remarkable man.  Starting from his humble beginnings in England, all the way through his illustrious Hollywood career and to his golden years - the reader will get a wonderful insight into this fantastic actor.  The stories are told by his colleagues, friends and people in his life as they remembered him.  The who's who of Hollywood give their deepest respect to Mr. Grant.  You will learn that he was a true gentleman in real life as well.  He wanted only to be kind to his fellow man and respected for his work.<br />If you are a fan of Cary Grant's, this is a must-read book.	2004-03-25

But this book is NOT a call for tree-hugging nor saving the whales nor any other distinctly direct environmental action.  Rather the book wants the reader to change his entire axis of thinking.<br />Through an ingenious device of a talking gorilla (symbolism is rich) named Ishmael, the reader goes on an analytical journey as the gorilla challenges the life-long beliefs of the other main character in the book.  Ishmael challenges the reader to try and understand man's place as a member of the environment rather than its ruler.  Ishmael speculates that man as a species is in a downward spiral because Man refuses to cooperate with Nature.<br />While you may not agree with the ideas presented in the book (especially if you are a believer that technology will solve all society's ills), the ideas must be acknowledged as reasonable.  Ishmael states that nature has its way of balancing a population of a species and humans are attempting to circumvent this balancing act.  For example, if humans produce excessive food, a population will grow to meet that supply.  That is just way of nature and while humans are a sentient species, we are still animals and part of the world order of Nature.<br />Such ideas that we are all a part of nature and so on are nothing new but what makes Quinn's book stand out is that it tries to use logic and reasoning to reach conclusions, rather than emotion.	2003-09-27

Or put another way, people want to have their cake and eat it too.  Traditionally the bourgeois were the career-oriented, money-accumulating yet dull constituents of society.  The free-wheeling, starving-artists yet more exciting group was the bohemians.<br />Over the past fifteen years or so, these groups are converging towards some middle ground.  Mr. Brooks describes this happening through examples such as the proliferation of certain types of \\"bobo towns\\" across America.  These quaint towns consist of charming cafes, admirable antique stores and a slew of high-end franchise stores such as Restoration Hardware and Smith &amp; Hawken.  Further examples of the bobo culture are stated through their activities, goals, and status symbols.  Bohemians no longer want to be starving or poor and Brooks uses Ben &amp; Jerry's and other smaller scale hippie turned well-off corporation as examples.<br />Mr. Brooks' writing style is bemusement toward this change in culture and the book is liberally sprinkled with humor bordering on condescension.  This creates an enjoyable and leisurely read as you will find yourself nodding in agreement with what is written.	2003-09-27

A motley, yet extremely intelligent, cast of characters playing with enormous sums of other people's dollars come crashing down to earth.  The negative ramifications were deemed to be so extreme that the Federal Reserve was asked to step in and lead a bailout by the leading Wall St. banks.<br />Mr. Lowenstein journalistically tracks the rise and fall of the group of men that caused a financial crisis of the utmost significance.  While the arcane details of the finance can be difficult, Lowenstein does an excellent job of clarifying and simplifying the concepts into laymen terms.<br />In the same vein as other books of brawny banking (i.e. Barbarians at the Gate, Liar's Poker), When Genius Failed expertly shows the reader the gamesmanship an inside world and its arrogant players.  This is a definite-read for finance and non-finance people alike.	2003-09-27

Democracy must be coupled by the strong forces of constitutional liberation which reinforces democracy through freedom of the press, an incorruptible legal system, a protective and not oppressive security forces (i.e. police and/or military) and other basic but necessary functioning organizations of society.  Without these organizations and practices, a country will spiral into disaster even though it may be considered a democracy because the country will be illiberal.<br />An illiberal democracy may have free elections but the citizens will not have liberty.  The rush to free elections in a developing country is not the best course of action for a country.  Some level of autocratic government can be more beneficial for a people instead.  Zakaria cogently supports his ideas with numerous examples from various countries around the globe - Singapore, India, Chile, China, Chad, etc.  He effectively illustrates countries where stability and people's freedom have ultimately flourished and foundered.<br />Zakaria also argues that excessive public participation in government is not necessarily healthy for functioning democracies.  He spends a significant chapter discussing the state of democracy within the United States.  Here, he grimly lays out evidence of a deteriorating democracy that is crippling the U.S. government's ability to lead.  The increase in direct democratization has given exceptional power to special interest groups which has allowed these organizations, that represent a sliver of the entire population, to hijack government's ability to create effective policies.  Zakaria interestingly points out that the three most effective (and most revered) institutions in the United States are the Supreme Court, the armed forces and the Federal Reserve System.  All three institutions are insulated from the pressures of public opinion and have the autonomy to do what its members feel is in the best national interest.  Yet with an effective freedom of the press, these institutions' powers are held in check.<br />In the United States, we have come to take for granted that constitutional liberalism and democracy coexist in our society.  But that has not always been the case.  This book's great value is in helping the reader understand that and why we should care.	2003-05-27

This book is his attempt to explain to the reader, why he loves America and correspondingly what makes this country worth loving.  Interwoven into that central theme are almost Tocquevillian observations about America such as affirmative action and its antecedents (i.e. slavery, civil rights, etc.), examples of America as a land of opportunity and a comparatively extended analysis on the source and impact of the 9/11 terror attacks to name just a few.<br />Mr. DSouza is a controversial writer and his critics claim that he is far too academic and does not live in reality.  Such censure is probably a bit unfair.  While you may not agree with everything that DSouza writes, he makes cogent arguments for some of his positions while other arguments stand on a bit shakier ground.  A weak argument for example, DSouza strongly believes that 3/5th Compromise was strictly political and the Founding Fathers personal beliefs in slavery were not an issue.  Unless Mr. DSouza somehow managed to ask the Founding Fathers themselves and in the absence of strong evidence, I find his argument on that topic hard to believe.<br />Mr. DSouza may be more convincing because he was born and raised in India.  As such he is able to more clearly see the advantages and disadvantages of this country more starkly.  He feels his professional and personal success and happiness could ONLY have happened in the United States.  Therefore this book is probably his thank you to this great country.	2003-05-27

The bulk of the book consists of his twice-a-week Pulitzer Prize-winning column in The New York Times from the period a month or so before 9/11 to almost 9 months after the unspeakable event.  After the columns, Friedman has devoted 84 pages towards a diary where he delves into further detail about the topics discussed in the columns of the book.<br />Many of the columns (and the book) stem from Friedman's focus to understand what would drive 19 middle class educated lunatics to hate life more than to love it.  From this basic premise, Friedman explores the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Arab education systems (especially the religious schools), U.S. foreign policies, and U.S. domestic policies to name just a few.<br />Friedman has an extraordinary background in the Arab-Israeli conflict (read his From Beirut to Jerusalem book) and thus is able to cogently portray the issues from as many sides as possible.  Friedman bashes the religious zealots in the Arab world for spreading hatred, the political correctness in the U.S. who claim that America is somehow responsible, as well as the Israelis for colonizing areas they probably shouldn't be in.  But some of the columns are witty as they are insightful (\\"Naked Air\\" where he wryly and symbolically advocates the creation of an airline where all the passengers must fly naked in order to ensure maximum security.).<br />Within this book, Friedman further tells us why America is such a great country through the things that he observes - his daughter's multicultural middle school, the enormous outpouring of support for the victims' families after 9/11, and the insurmountable military might of a country, etc.  When you are finished, you should be left with more understanding about the mosaic causes of the horrible events of 9/11 coupled with a greater appreciation of why America is such a great country and will be stronger than before.	2003-05-11

The two major stories of the book involve Mr. Feynman's enormously influential first wife, Arlene and the second story involves Mr. Feynman's work in the Challenger disaster investigation.  Sprinkled around these two major bookends are other humorous adventures and observations about a trip to Japan, being labeled a sexist pig by feminists, and hotel hunting in Europe to name just a few.<BR> <BR>The Challenger investigation takes up a sizable chunk of the book and is sometimes filled with drier material.  But the compelling event and frustrating insight into government bureaucracy holds some interest to make up for the technical specifications.<br />The first part of the book where his wife Arlene is discussed is so touching and powerful that the reader will be hard pressed not to get teary-eyed.<br />As noted in the review about the first biography, Mr. Feynman was an extremely curious person who explored things out of simple curiosity.  His life's quest was nothing simpler than a desire to understand Nature.  All the while, he tried to have the best time he could.  Hopefully this reader can take away at least a little bit of that.	2003-05-04

The New World Order according to Friedman began when the Berlin Wall fell  capitalism effectively defeated communism.  The inevitable ensuing evolution is globalization  defined by Friedman as the inexorable integration of markets, transportation systems, and communication systems to a degree never witnessed before  in a way that is enabling corporations, countries, and individuals to reach around the world farther, faster, deeper, and cheaper than ever before, and in a way that is enabling the world to reach into corporations, countries, and individuals farther, faster, deeper, and cheaper than ever before.<br />Congruously, Friedman explores a nations desire to grow and enter the future, symbolized by Japans Lexus vehicles.  The Lexuss represent Japans establishment into the Modern Age, using technology and resources to improve the standard of living of its people.  On the other end of that spectrum is a nations desire to cling to its roots and origins  a respect for where the people came from  ancestors, history, culture, etc.  Friedman symbolizes this desire through the olive tree.  All countries are faced with the same struggle  do we go for the Lexus or the Olive Tree.  Can we go for both?  How?  What are the implications of tipping that balance too far in one direction?<br />The debate in each country around such questions has been somewhat expedited or squashed by the tsunami of globalization.  Sometimes the country feels as if it doesnt have time or a choice  Get on board or get left behind.  What is a country to do?  How does it navigate through these uncharted waters?  What are the uncharted waters?  Friedman explores these questions and more in this book.<br />It is interesting to read this book nearly four years after its publication.When it was written and published, the Internet Economy and the corresponding stock bubble was THE topic.  The world was subject to all sorts of hair-brained schemes of a drastic paradigm shift in the way people will do business, live their daily lives, interact with the rest of society, etc.  While change certainly has occurred at a rapid pace and no doubt will continue to do so, the overreaching claims made by titans of that time period have fallen flat  Cisco & Amazon (two companies often repeated in the book) valuations have dwindled dramatically while Enron is non-existent.<br />Friedman is correct in his overarching theories about globalization but the details have not necessarily withstood the test of even a short time.  This clearly detracts from the book which otherwise makes a strong statement and delivers some insight into the ongoing struggle to balance modernity and respect for ones past.	2003-05-04

Ms. Chua does not advocate Marxism, is not anti-capitalist, is not anti-globalist and is not anti-democracy.  Rather, her simple premise is that the wholesale simultaneous installation of democracy and free markets to developing countries leads to ethnic hatred and often tragic results.  She convincingly illustrates this point through the various examples of countries in the book.  Furthermore, she claims that her thesis is not the only cause for instability within countries.  Other factors also significantly affect the stability of a country (or region).<br />Her \\"market-dominant minority\\" is one of the major sources of a country's potential instability.  This group is a minority that controls the vast majority of wealth in a nation.  For example, 3 percent of the Filipino population is Chinese yet this 3% controls over 70% of the Filipino wealth.  The enormous increase in wealth results from entering free markets and then the gross disproportionate distribution of wealth eventually leads to death and destruction when the poor majority gets the democratic power to physically oust (or kill) the outsider minority.<br />The book's main shortcoming is a lack of an explanation about how to handle the \\"market-dominant minority\\" issue and ultimately avoid bloodshed.  But Chua does state that a remedy is beyond her book's scope.  Rather, this book provides a different and valuable insight into the rampant spread of globalization and should be read by anyone desiring greater understanding of that topic.	2003-04-28

The book's title would lead you to correctly believe that most of the stories are melancholy in tone.<br />Even though writer Jhumpa Lahiri covers Indian characters, this is not an \\"Indian\\" book.  The struggles and emotions that her characters face are universal to everyone and here lies the book's great power.  For example, in the first story alone, the central couple had faced a tragedy in their lives.  While she is describing their torment, you don't think of them as Indian people.  The characters' circumstances may be different, but their motivations are not.<br />Lahiri's simple, yet substantive style (much like Truman Capote) immediately draws you in.  It's as if she invited you over for afternoon tea on a rainy day and then proceeded to tell you several stories about people she knew over the years.  I can't wait to hear the next set of stories.	2003-04-15

(Adventures of a Curious Character)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Nobel laureate, bongo player, ladies� man and full of life	As far as Nobel Prize winners go, Mr. Feynman surely must be the most interesting of the lot.  This autobiography is a remarkable journey from Feynman's youth through to his golden years.  He mostly covers his professional life but does touch upon personal incidents (disease and death of his first wife).<br />Throughout his storied life, Mr. Feynman had worked on the Manhattan Project, lectured students on physics at premier universities, traveled and taught in Brazil and Japan, played the bongos and drums, frequented strip clubs, won a Nobel Prize, chased women, deciphered Mayan hieroglyphics and solved a space shuttle disaster mystery to name just a few adventures.<br />The books consists of individual stories that cover major sections of his life (college years, Manhattan Project years, etc.)  Throughout these stories, Feynman presents himself as a fellow who effortlessly found himself in odd and amazing situations.  For instance, while playing a tambourine-like instrument in Rio de Janeiro, Feynman ended up in the Carnival festivities partying through the streets.  With other such incidents, Feynman is one who has lived a full life.  I would have loved to have met such a unique individual.  As such, this book is a wonderful starting point.	2003-04-09

Friedman assumes that the reader has no knowledge of the conflict and takes time to give the reader ample background on the geography, politics, history, etc. of the troubled region.<br />In the first half of the book, Friedman discusses Lebanon and Beirut while the second half moves to Israel and Jerusalem.  Friedman focuses extensively on the leaders of the region over the years (i.e. Arafat, Sharon, Rabin, etc.) and how their personalities have molded the conflict.  As a gifted storyteller would, Friedman discusses the Palestinian society and how events lead to the emergence and explosion of the Palestinian intifada.  Also, intricately intertwined into this conflict are the Arab world and the United States.  Friedman also explores these relationships and their impact on the conflict.  Here, he sheds some light on the dictatorial characters of the region, including Saddam Hussein, by briefly explaining how these men came to power and are able to maintain it.<br />The book essentially ends in 1989 or 1990.  It would be interesting to read Friedman's thoughts on the region in the next decade-plus since the book was written.  Regardless, this book should be a mandatory read for individuals who want to either begin to or further understand the situation in the Middle East.	2003-04-02

The book encompasses a series of successive Tuesday visits Mr. Albom made to Morrie in order to get to know him.  Over the course of these visits, Mr. Albom learns a few things about Life (family, career, love, etc.) from the older, gentler and wiser Morrie.<br /> <br />Mr. Albom appears to go through a life transformation as he starts to discover the truer meanings of life.  More specifically he sees a kind man degenerate before his eyes to the point where Morrie can no longer perform basic bathroom duties without assistance.  Through the observations and conversations, Mr. Albom starts to recognize that the pursuit of money, career, etc. is not as important as spending time with his loved ones.<br /> <br />Such an axiom is nothing new.  I would even argue that a lot of people already know this.  But how does one adopt that philosophy and practice it?  Clearly, Mr. Albom wants to share this life revelation with his readers but ultimately in the end, the book comes up short.  While Albom means well, the chapters are trite and lacking depth.  It is wonderful that Mr. Albom has benefited from his Tuesdays with Morrie but in order for people to realize whats important to them, they will need to find their own Morrie.	2003-03-13

Within the pages are incredible stories of commoners horrifyingly murdered, monstrous leaders fueled by drugs and futile U.S. policies.  Kirk does an excellent job of giving ordinary priests, butchers and townsfolk a human face and when some of them are killed, you feel the pain and frustration.<br />The historical context that Kirk provides is extremely informative and her analysis of the Gaitan assassination and subsequent U.S. response sets the stage for the rest of the book.  <BR>Also powerful are Kirks descriptions of the guerilla and paramilitary leaders, especially Castano.  While their actions are unspeakably monstrous, their arguments in support of their actions are terrifyingly cogent.  While you will not condone their actions, you may find yourself nodding in agreement only to realize that he is talking about murdering innocent people.<br />There were some drawbacks to the book.  While Ms. Kirk states at the end of the book that this was not meant to be comprehensive, her omission of significant facts does limit the effectiveness of her message.  For example, from another book, I learned that Colombian drug lords feared extradition to the United States more than just about anything else.  I do not recall anywhere in this book where this fact is clearly stated.  Simply stating this would have been invaluable since one huge reason that Escobar and others intensified violence was as a response to the Colombian governments reinstatement of extradition.<br />The book could have used some better transitions and tighter editing but the nightmarish stories of the common person is more than enough to overlook those minor points.	2003-03-13

The book is the fascinating account of an actual murder of an innocent family in southwestern Kansas.<br />Four members of the unsuspecting Clutter family were methodically and viciously murdered on their farm in mid November back in 1959.  The crime was a mystery as no one had seen the murderers nor could a motive be discovered.  Eventually two men are found to most likely be involved.  The story is not a who-dun-it but rather an analysis of a crime and the mystery as to why two men would drive over 400 miles to kill four people who they did not know.  It is this last point that provides the greater context of the story.  Capote was attempting to explore the criminal mind and find some psychological motivation for criminal behavior.<br />In Cold Blood is considered an American classic and it rightfully deserves that accolade.  It was one of the first books of its kind - a novel of a true incident - and it is still one of the best books of any genre.  Capote's style is leisurely, straightforward and informative and yet somehow provides the reader with enormous tension at all the right places.  Furthermore, while reading the book I just couldn't help but keep thinking that this is a true story, which makes the book more horrifying.	2003-02-24

Written by a documentary filmmaker, Streatfield's enormously thorough tome not only takes you across various geographies, but also through time.  Starting with the Incan and Aztec uses of the coca leaf, Streatfield takes us on an incredible journey of a substance that leads us through to the Latin American domination of production while highlighting the U.S. consumerism of the product.<br />The amount of detail in this book is staggering as Streatfield has spent a lot of time researching materials as well as tracking down individuals around the globe.  Statistics are liberally used to drive home his points.  For example, in the 1980's the Miami Federal Reserve Bank had an unexpected surplus of US $5.5 Billion.  This was more than all of the other 11 Federal Reserve Banks combined.  The book is full of statistics like this that demonstrate the scale of impact of cocaine.<br />In addition to the facts and figures, we are introduced to some fascinating characters on this journey.  We learn of Sigmund Freud's addiction to cocaine (there are some who believe that his great work would have not been possible without cocaine), the American distributor George Jung (popularized in the movie Blow), super narco-terrorist Pablo Escobar and his ilk and many others.  Some characters are superfluous (i.e. Freud) but others are more central to machinations of the cocaine industry and their impact is thoroughly explored (i.e. George Jung, Carlos Ledher).<br />If there is a con in the book, it is that some chapters are not labeled as properly as they could be.  For example, the chapter where we are introduced to George Jung and his Colombian buddy ends with an extensive discussion about Colombia and Pablo Escobar.  The chapter title leads us to believe none of that and probably could have been titled \\"George leads to Colombian dominance\\" or something like that.  This would give the reader a better idea of what to expect in each chapter.<br />If you are even the least bit curious about Cocaine, then this book is a must for you.  Streatfield's writing style can be a bit whimsical at times but it provides just the right note of humor in a tome of documentary proportions and scope.	2003-02-23

The book's fame has been catapulted by the classic film with Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard.  While the movie follows the novella fairly closely, there are some significant differences between the two works.  I will not reveal them here.<br />In Holly Golightly, Tiffany's central character, Truman Capote has created his self-stated favorite character, a charming yet flighty high-class call girl.  The book follows Holly's nights of debauchery with days of conversations and activities with a writer (narrator as well).  Some plot elements involving mobsters, a person from Holly's past, a Latin playboy and a few other minor characters tie the story together into an entertaining tale.  But the true joy with this book is the time the reader will spend with Holly.  Despite her different station in life, readers will identify with her fears, hopes and desires for comfort (the source of the book's title).  Furthermore, Capote's leisurely style of writing makes the work far more engaging.<br />If you have some brief free time, this brilliant work will be a lovely way to spend a quiet afternoon.	2003-02-21

The story's central character, Grady Tripp, faces a \\"perfect storm\\" of troubles during a wild weekend with an assortment of characters including one of Tripp's demure students, Tripp's partying agent friend, and other characters affiliated with the university.  Grady's wife decides to leave him after discovering his philandering ways, his agent is seeking the completion of Grady's interminable 2,000 plus page novel and his mistress drops the bomb by declaring she is pregnant.  The reader will essentially go on a trip with Grady during the weekend while he quarter-heartedly attempts to sort out his matters.<br />The book is rich with similes, metaphors and references (that will even test your general knowledge as well) that illuminate the rather prosaic story.  Chabon allows the reader to sample a bit of geography, baseball, Greek mythology, pop Americana among other wide ranging topics.  But most deliciously, Chabon's style is leisurely, almost Capotesque, in taking the time to explore the characters through witty dialogue.  You will get a full sense of what it would be like to be with all of the characters.  Spending the weekend with a stoner and literate womanizer was never this much fun.	2003-02-15

City: An Illustrated History	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Parts are way better than the sum	Ms. Maddex has created an interesting and well-researched book that allows the reader to learn a bit more about New York City's vast sexual history over the centuries. Starting with Dutch settlements in the 1600's all the way through to the current times, the book attempts to canvas New York City's sex culture through individual stories and news snippets accompanied with illustrations and/or photos. Some of these individual snippets on each page are extremely interesting as there are stories plucked directly from the headlines of the time. Moreover, Ms. Maddex attempts to catalog the history of women and gays over the centuries.<br />This book adds a new dimension if you have lived in NYC and have an appreciation for its rich history. The only drawback is that after I completed the book, I wasn't sure what Ms. Maddex was trying to say besides just cataloging the sex culture of NYC over the centuries. I wanted some overarching theme that tied all of the stories together more tightly. But regardless, you will be entertained.	2003-02-11

Business dealings at the highest levels are still usually about fame and egos rather than what is good business sense.  It is within this context that the outstanding Barbarian at the Gates, by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, has been written.  This fascinating and detailed account, by the Wall Street Journal reporters who initially reported the case, gives insight into corporate power struggles to buy RJR Nabisco back in the late 1980's.<br />More specifically, the story involves Rob Johnson, the then CEO of RJR Nabisco and how some investment bankers corral him into a highly risky, yet immensely lucrative MBO.  The story unfolds with great suspense (and wit) as the process of the MBO occurs.  The writers have taken arcane financial terms and made them easy for any reader to understand so an MBO (management buy-out) is not understood only by an MBA.<br />But much more powerfully, the writers have given the characters great depth as the reader really can envision who these players are.  When Kravis is sitting at the table, the writers clearly describe who has the power and who doesn't.  You get the sense that you are right in the middle of the action.  Barbarians at the Gate is an entertaining and informative tale about Corporate America.<br />You will not be disappointed with this read.	2003-02-10
US	52107123	RYLX2M6HYISQQ	0671519816	129533604	Inca Gold (Dirk Pitt Adventure)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Silly yet very entertaining	In the middle of the Peruvian Andes, adventurer Dirk Pitt rescues a group of academics that leads to a whirlwind adventure with Peruvian guerrillas and scheming villains in the Andean jungle and Mexico.  Ultimately, there is a search for some lost legendary Incan treasure that pits the good guys with some real evil men.<br />Inca Gold is a run-of-the-mill silly adventure tale but still delivers an entertaining punch at all the right times.  The tongue-in-cheek comments by the hero and the clichéd remarks by the villains all prove to provide the reader with a nice chuckle.  There is enough local color and actual facts (the guerrilla army is an actual group in Peru) to keep the reader feeling as if they are there in the midst of the action.  The occasional Inca history passages educate the reader enough to satisfy a superficial curiosity into that fascinating culture.  The unfolding of the plot is nothing less than predictable but you will blitz through the story with a smirk all the way.	2003-02-09
US	52107123	R1BX2WF4N5C6QS	0060509058	486440079	Travels	Books	5	4	5	N	N	You may not agree with all but gets you thinking	Michael Crichton's deeply autobiographical work, Travels is as an exploration into a person's quest for understanding the world around him and within him.  The reader is entertained with snippets of stories that begin in Mr. Crichton's days in medical school and end with a treatise on understanding reality that was to be delivered to a debunking society.  Between these bookmarks, Crichton has visited many exotic locals (including northern Pakistan) in addition to quasi summer camps for spiritual growth, charkas, and other New Age topics.<br />Crichton succeeds in writing about these inner travels as clinically as possible.  He is not trying to \\"sell\\" you on his experience but rather just trying to get the reader to listen to him.  He allows you to make up your mind and even towards the end of the book, he outright states, \\"Don't take my word for it.  Go out and see for yourself.\\"<br />Travels is my favorite Crichton work because it covers most of his life as he transforms from a purely scientific individual to one who learns to accept that maybe science doesn't have all of the answers.  We see how he challenges himself to look at things in a different way or have a new experience which he claims ultimately makes him a more well-rounded person.<br />While Crichton is supporting the non-scientific world (i.e. psychics, metaphysicists etc.), he is quick to point out that that realm doesn't have all the answers either but that world cannot be discounted.  You may not agree with some of the ideas presented in the book but Crichton doesn't necessarily want you to change your thinking.  Rather he wants to get you thinking about ideas in a different way and that is the book's greatest value.	2003-02-09

I've used this feature in Chicago quite extensively (i.e. show me all of the Italian restaurants less than [money] with at least 15 rating, etc.)<br />This book is extremely useful but in a different way - we leave the book in the car so when we are out and get the urge to eat out, we can easily look up restaurants.	2003-02-09
US	52107123	R34536QDH8ASHL	0345378490	694344232	Congo	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Great jungle adventure yarn!	If you are going to be at the beach , then Congo is clearly the book for you.  Congo is a good old-fashioned jungle adventure yarn.  The author, Michael Crichton, was clearly inspired by the adventure stories of H. Rider Haggard but with a slight dose of Conrad.  And since this is a Crichton novel, the reader will read about technological ruminations, which provoke Crichton's favorite theme - man meddling with nature when he probably shouldn't.<br />A rescue team, funded (and partially staffed) by a U.S. based technology corporation, is sent to the middle of the Congo area of Africa to determine the mysterious disappearance of a prior team.  On their extraordinary journey, they encounter rebellious armed forces of central African nations, fabulous cities with lost treasures, strange tribes tucked away in the forest, cannibalistic groups and some unknown force that appears to kill.  Crichton keeps the pace swift so you will keep the pages turning.<br />This book is a delightful read because Crichton delivers on his trademarks.  He blends well-researched topics from diverse sciences - Congo covers biology, anthropology, archaeology, as well as descriptions of high-tech equipment (for 1979).  Crichton effectively increases the suspense by giving the locations scale and a powerful perspective.  The mountains, \\"unending virginal forest\\", and \\"thousands of miles of unexplored territory\\" dwarf his human characters.  Finally, Crichton's storytelling gift of framing the story as a true account (along with an extensive bibliography) lends the verisimilitude that so often elevates Crichton's work.<br />You will not be disappointed with this quick read.	2003-02-08

The book is (or was) an excellent primer to understanding the fundamental concepts of e-commerce.  But while there are some business concepts thrown in (i.e. the 5 C's), they do not expand on those basic understandings of the Internet and its businesses.  Anyone who had been following the Internet years via other publications would already possess the necessary knowledge that this book provides.  If you don't have a good understanding, then at [$$$], there are cheaper alternatives.<br />A great boost to this book would have been including a CD containing even one of Mr. Afuah's lectures.  Mr. Afuah is a brilliant and knowledgeable man who challenges his students to think beyond just the basics.  We were not able to get away with trite responses not backed up with data.  Since this is hard to do through a book, an interactive CD could at least be somewhat useful.	2003-02-07

In addition to the razor-sharp wit, Smith's other great gift as a storyteller is the ability to deliver social insights through his characters.  In Clerks, when Randall reprimands Dante for constantly shirking personal responsibility for Dante's actions, Smith is talking to all of us.  Smith's characters in both works are immature but by the end have hopefully learned something that makes them grow, even if just a bit.  Maybe we could be so lucky.<br />This book is a great read AFTER you have seen the movies.  It contains enjoyable scenes that unfortunately did not make it into the films.  If you haven't had the pleasure of viewing the movies, I won't disclose the plot here even in summary as I would not want to spoil your enjoyment of the films.  And if you've seen the films, no summary is necessary.	2003-01-20

I am grateful that an erudite and insightful writer as Shashi Tharoor has taken the time to write India:  From Midnight to Millennium.  This work will allow the reader to get a firm overview of the major points that drive India.  If there is a minor fault in the work, it is that Tharoor fails to include any sort of bibliography that could serve the reader to learn more about the topics.<br />Occasionally, Tharoor's deep love of India becomes distracting in this otherwise objective book.  But then again, it is that precise subjectivity that Tharoor is communicating through his book - India is at least 1 billion truths.  From Midnight to Millennium is one such excellent truth that will provide the reader a powerful starting point for learning more about India.	2003-01-16

Her murder provides the framework that allows the writer, Shashi Tharoor, to explore religion, Hindu-Muslim relations, Indian politics, western companies entering India and other related topics about the Subcontinent.  This book provides a great primer to understanding these topics and allows you to springboard further into these pressing issues for India.  One downside, albeit minor, is that some of the material expressed in this book (views on religion, Coca Colonization, etc.) has been covered at greater lengths, especially in Tharoor's work, India:  From Midnight to Millennium.<br />But the book is not just an encapsulated India lesson.  It is also a passionate love story (in many regards - the obvious male-female love story, parental love, love of country, etc.).  Tharoor is a master of the English language and his exact words invoke a sense that you are actually there in India, enjoying the scenery and the characters that inhabit it.  If you read this novel, you will not be disappointed, but rather entertained with a little enlightenment.	2003-01-14

After their illicit transaction, they discover that their theft was more than 100 times the initial amount.  How they stole so much involves an unlikely scheme to create millions out of nothing.<br />And that is precisely what Brad Meltzer has done for himself.  While The Millionaires is not a horrible book, it can become tedious at over 500 pages.  Was it really necessary to have Miami as a locale?  Couldn't Meltzer have had the characters go straight to Orlando and save us 100 pages?  A tighter story could have increased the tension.<br />I have learned that Meltzer does meticulous research about the various geographies in his books.  While the landmarks, street and highway names are richly on-target, the characters inhabiting those locations seem to lack the same local color.<br />In the end, Meltzer has created a serviceable beach novel with a preposterous plot that his editor should have trimmed to make slightly more interesting.	2003-01-05

Unfortunately, his latest novel Prey will probably not usher in waves of praise.  It is too bad because Crichton deals with issues that are pertinent to all people and his ideas are supported by relevant research.<br />Prey reads like an expanded movie script where action scenes have been fleshed out with perfunctory swiftness.  This book is disappointingly a second-rate effort when compared to his similarly themed, yet vastly superior Jurassic Park.  In that masterpiece, Crichton successfully evoked descriptive terror while entertaining the reader.  But in that work, people were able to rely on mental pictures of dinosaurs from childhood memories and such so Crichton didn't need to work as hard to deliver the frightening images.  Here, the menacing entities are nanoparticles - particles that are significantly smaller than the width of a human hair.  While these nanoparticles wreak havoc through predatory behavior, they still lack a cogent character.  While a future technology appears to be far more dangerous than say an extinct animal, the effort in making nanoparticles terrifying comes up short.  This may not be entirely Crichton's fault as nanotechnology is not as commonplace to people as genetic technologies and thus does not deliver the suspense that Crichton has so successfully conjured in novels past.<br />Jack Forman, the protagonist, is a stay-at-home father of three who was fired from his last job for blowing the whistle on his boss.  Fortunately for him, his wife Julia just happens to Vice President for Xymos Technologies, a secretive firm that is conducting hush-hush experiments in the Nevada desert when Jack is hastily hired to firefight some serious programming problems.  Meanwhile his wife inexplicably begins to exhibit indignant and strange behavior and upsetting the home-life balance that Jack has persevered to achieve.  Can there be some connection with her job or is this Crichton exploring the gender role reversal a la Disclosure?<br />The first third of the book sluggishly takes place mostly at Jack's home and here Crichton seems to be unable to find any pace in writing about domestic living.  For such a large chunk of text, the characters' dialogue is poorly written (especially the children's).   Crichton shines best when he exercises his wonderful gift of explaining abstract scientific concepts in layman's terms.  The passages about the nanotechnology, emergent behavior and biological terms make for interesting reading in sharp contrast to his domestic diatribe.<br />Prey is recommended for its ruminations on science but only if you can tolerate the prosaic passages about some of the characters' home life and mundane action scenes.  The bibliography at the end does provide an outstanding springboard learning about the scientific principles presented in the book.	2002-12-02
