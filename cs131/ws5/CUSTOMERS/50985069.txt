US	50985069	RQWQ1RCWZZIJH	1889330566	828343467	Georgia Under Water	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Georgia Under Water	Georgia Jackson, a teenager living in Florida in the late 1970s, has a lot on her mind. Her parents are splitting up, she alternately loves and hates her alcoholic father, her brother runs away every month, and, most significant, she's growing up to be beautiful. This book has a cool format--it's made up of a series of interlocking chapters that can be read seperatly or as a whole novel. I loved it because Georgia makes the most simple, yet perfect observations. She compares a boyfriend's hands to &quot;cheerful squids&quot; and her newly lengthy legs to &quot;long, sleek noodles.&quot; Also, unlike the heroines of most books about teenage girls, she's wild and confident.	2001-07-10

But when Jeffrey lionel Magee wanders into Teo Mills, Pennsylvania, a legend is in the making. It's a little hard to believe, because Jeffrey's a scruffy twelve-year-old kid--not exactly hero material. But before too long, the  stories begin to circulate: about how fast and how far he can run. About  how he knocks the world's first-ever &quot;frogball&quot; for an  inside-the-park home-run bunt. About how he scores forty-nine touchdowns  the time he plays football with the high school team, and about how he  performs other feats so incredible that they earn him the nickname  &quot;Maniac.&quot; But all that is nothing compared to the bravest,  craziest thing jeffrey ever does at Two Mills-- The thing he does for the  kids from the east end and those from the West End.  This is his story, and  it's a story that is very careful not to get the facts mixed up with the  truth.	2000-02-22
