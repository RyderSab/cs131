Sholokhov won the Nobel Prize for this novel of war and revolution among the Don Cossack host. Although painted across a backdrop of history, it is primarily the love story of Gregor and Aksinya. As much of great 20th century Russian literature, the style harks back to Tolstoy, but the subject matter is undeniably Soviet. Published in 1929, \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" was the pinnacle of Sholokhov's career. He never again produced a work to compare, although to be fair to him, his career coincided with the height of Stalinist conformity in the arts. This was an era when simply being a famous writer was dangerous - think of the careers of Pasternak, Babel, and Pilnyak. If Sholokhov descended into the role of a party hack churning out the obligatory Socialist Realist pap, at least he lived to a ripe old age!	2005-06-18

Fall's \\"Hell in a Very Small Place\\" is undeniably a classic of military history. It has at one time or another been an assigned text at the U.S. Naval War College and West Point. Fall had an unusual career as an academic who conducted field research by accompanying first French forces and later Americans into combat in Indochina. Such dedication to his work eventually cost him his life.<br /><br />\\"Hell in a Very Small Place\\" is the definitive account of the battle at Dien bien phu -- a debacle that ended the French empire in Indochina. It is a sad tale of folly. The arrogance and stupidity of French political and military leaders are only partially redeemed by the valor and esprit of their soldiers -- French, Vietnamese, and Legionaires. They made a mistake fatal to many throughout history by underestimating the enemy. French generals believed their firepower, air support, and professional soldiery would allow them to annihilate the Viet Minh in open combat. Vo Nguyen Giap displayed the strategic vision, logistical flexibility, and the tactical determination to turn the tables and instead destroy the French Union's elite forces.<br /><br />Fall's book is not only well written and readable, but also authoritative. His research is thorough, using both primary and secondary sources. In 1966 David Schoenbrun said of \\"Hell in a Very Small Place\\" that \\"future historians will be using Fall's book as their main source material.\\" Thirty nine years after publication, that statement is still true.	2005-06-18

They are Calder Willingham and Hamilton Basso.<br /><br />I finished Basso's \\"The View from Pompey's Head\\" just last week.  It is slow moving in a pleasant, languid, distinctly Southern manner.

It is an intriguing look at the development of a frontier community in the earliest days of the republic. The story of parvenu William Cooper's rise and eventual decline from political and social prominence in Upstate New York is well-told with keen insight into the fractiousness of early U.S. politics.<br /><br />James Fenimore Cooper's first great success in the literary world was a fictionalized account of his father's life. While there are many valuable histories of early American life, Taylor's book is particularly fascinating due to the parallel between William Cooper's life story and his son's novel, \\"The Pioneers.\\" \\"William Cooper's Town\\" is a unique combination of political history, social analysis and biography linked to a study on James Fenimore Cooper's literary effort to vindicate his father's struggle for wealth, social prominence and prestige.<br /><br />Taylor's book is an interesting new twist on the old story of a rising man on America's frontier. I recommend it highly. It is well worth your reading time.	2005-06-08

MacDonald Fraser is the acclaimed author of the Flashman series of historical fiction, but here he reveals his own experience as an infantryman in merciless combat against the Japanese in Burma.  Here is an all-too-vivid recollection of the fear, pain, discomfort and -- yes -- the pleasure of comradeship among the common soldiers who win or lose ALL wars.  MacDonald Fraser reminds us that wars are not just \\"politics by other means,\\" wars are about young men -- their lives, their deaths, and their friendships.

Bernard Fall explored the French disaster brilliantly -- exposing the foolishness of the French military and political leaders while honoring the valor and dedication of the fighting men. Fall was a Frenchman who immigrated to America and accompanied French Union forces for graduate research at a U.S. university. His writing brought to light the hidebound French military leadership's failure to grasp the realities of counter-insurgency warfare. The French knew mobility was the key to thwart the Viet Minh, but they applied European concepts of mobile warfare that depended too heavily on roads and vehicular transport. The cruel fate of Mobile Group 1 in central Annam unveiled the limitations of French military vision more completely than the renowned fiasco at Dien Bien Phu.<br /><br />The French bungled and miscalculated everywhere. They failed at tactical intelligence gathering, routinely neglected to conduct adequate reconnaissance, mismanaged the propaganda war, underestimated the capabilities and tenacity of their enemy and squandered troops and scarce material resources in defense of worthless fixed installations. In virtually every respect, French leadership ceded the initiative to General Giap and Ho Chi Minh - and you don't win by simply reacting to your enemy. One of war's oldest maxims is: Carry the war to the enemy. The French did not. The Viet Minh carried it to them - again, and again, and again!<br /><br />\\"Street Without Joy\\" drew lessons from the French debacle applicable to America's growing involvement in Indo-China; unfortunately Fall was a prophet without honor in his adopted country. While a few forward-looking American officers appreciated the value of effective counter-insurgency warfare, conventional forces generals held sway in Saigon, Hawaii and Washington. Some of our greatest successes in Vietnam resulted from effective operations by Special Forces, Combined Action Platoons and indigenous guerillas, but most of our vast resources went into conventional operations. Bernard Fall told us what to expect in the jungles of Southeast Asia, but too few of our generals and politicians heeded the admonition., Combined Action Platoons and indigenous guerillas, but most of our vast resources went into conventional operations.

Beevor's story of the final collapse of Nazi Germany is not great historical writing. The narrative reads as a catalogue of events without the binding literary thread necessary to weave a compelling historical tale. There is little development of the historical figures -- their stories are not fleshed out. You end the book knowing not much more about Zhukov, Guderian, Chiukov or Weidling than when you started. \\"The Fall of Berlin 1945\\" is weak alongside John Toland's \\"The Last 100 Days\\" despite greater access to German and former Soviet archival material.<br />I was uncomfortably unsympathetic to the thousands of German women so savagely molested by the undisciplined Red Army. While the German women were certainly innocent victims, I couldn't help but think of the pain wrought by THEIR fathers, brothers, husbands and uncles throughout the Soviet Union and elsewhere. German womanhood reaped what their menfolk had sown. That's not a very charitable point of view, but it's mine nevertheless. The exposure of the scale of wanton pillage perpetrated by the Red Army is probably the most valuable contibution of Beevor's book. It's a story that needs telling and should be explored further -- by a better writer!	2002-11-05

As many reviewers have stated (here and in the press), Furst is a master at depicting Eastern Europe in the interwar years. His strength is atmosphere. He paints a picture in words that reflects the precariousness of life. As you read, you can FEEL yourself in Paris or Moscow or Madrid. You can SEE the characters, the cafes, and the seedy hotels. You can SMELL the Gauloises and TASTE the pastis.<br />Furst's plots, however, are weaker -- with twists more than slightly unbelievable (Stoianev just \\"happens\\" to see the Brotherhood Front symbol painted on the half-sunken barge in the Danube!). His cavalier approach to historical facts undermines his work as well -- either he researches poorly or underestimates his readers. I am willing to grant him artistic license, but he dubs the POUM as an anarchist organization (It's \\"Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista\\" -- a Trotskyist group. One can't be both Marxist and anarchist). Since this was George Orwell's militia -- described so well in the renowned \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" -- Furst fails Spanish Civil War 101! He also speaks of Stoianev's girlfriend frequenting a cafe in Paris because Picasso and Modigliani are seen there. Modigliani died in 1920. She must have hoped to meet his ghost! Unfortunately, there are a number of such lapses.<br />Don't let me sound too strident. Furst's novels -- starting with \\"Night Soldiers\\" -- are good reading. I've read them all.

CEFs provide an excellent method to target particular investment sectors -- especially international markets and fixed income. I like using CEFs for part of the fixed income component of an investment portfolio. When properly managed, they will enhance your dividend yield and supply capital appreciation potential. CEFs can provide greater yields by deriving dividends from portfolio assets at net asset value (NAV), but pay them based on the share's market price -- which can be at a discount to NAV. Simply put, you can buy dividends on $10 worth of assets for only $9. The investor (or their advisor) must, however, monitor the CEF's discount to premium spread versus NAV on a regular basis. CEFs can be tricky. I recommend all new CEF investors start out with this book -- it's a little dated -- but the principles remain true. Note Steven Samuels' advice: Never buy a CEF on the IPO -- and I would add, never buy one at a premium.	2001-12-19

Peter Bergen writes a solid -- if somewhat breezy -- account of the background and development of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and the anti-Western Islamist movement. The greatest revelations were the naivete and outright incompetence of various U.S. government officials and agencies in failing to heed intelligence warnings and placing political or diplomatic considerations above the safety of Americans -- specifically in Somalia, at the east African embassies, and in Yemen at the time of the USS Cole bombing. Bergen makes it clear -- Bin Laden and the Islamic Jihadists are engaged in a war without mercy against Western policies in the Middle East. They hold the U.S. responsible for the domestic failures of despotic regimes throughout the Islamic World. Bergen reveals -- as Thomas Friedman says -- the extent to which these nations and cultures have \\"failed at modernity.\\" The Islamists seek nothing less that to drive us from the region and destroy American political influence under the guise of religious orthodoxy. Let there be no doubt about it -- and Bergen explores this well -- if we cherish tolerance, the rule of law, freedom of expression, and the fundamental dignity of all people, then we need to be prepared to fight to the end against Bin Laden and his sympathizers. Our political values mean nothing to them! Bergen should be thanked for exposing the extremists, our weak government, and our duplicious \\"allies\\" so thoroughly.	2001-11-20

US	53008874	R1L7S6A7AP7OAA	0679601708	471273987	The Beleaguered City: The Vicksburg Campaign, December 1862-July 1863 (Modern Library)	Books	4	18	19	N	Y	Foote again at his best.	&quot;The Beleaguered City&quot; is a Modern Library adaptation of part of Foote's masterpiece, &quot;The Civil War.&quot; Excerpted for the lay reader, nothing of Foote's careful research or literary skill is lost. While always taking a backseat in American history to Gettysburg (the subject of another Modern Library edition of Foote &quot;Lite&quot;), Vicksburg was arguably the critical campaign of the Civil War -- it permanently severed the Confederacy, guaranteed Federal domination of the nation's premier waterborne trade route, and made the career of U. S. Grant. Foote's history is a delight -- good scholarship and good writing. I recommend it highly to Civil War buffs and casual readers alike. Just like &quot;Stars in Their Courses&quot; however, it suffers from poor maps.	2000-12-18
