In the last book, Field of Dischonor, Honor finally defeated her nemesis, Pavel Young (Earl North Hollow), once and for all.  Also, Denver Summervale, the mass murderer from the first books, finally bites off more than he can chew.<br />But, alas, though the Queen, Prime Minister, and Naval Brass support Honor privately, politics dictates sending her away to please the opposition in the House of Lords.  So, without a command, she goes to Grayson to take an active role in running her steading.  Naturally, there are still malcontents like the crazy cleric Marchant and the steadholders Mueller and Burdette who would just love to kill her off and turn back the clock.  Then, to top it all off, the Havenites have decided to invade Grayson again.  Fortunately, Admiral Matthews and Protector Mayhew decide to give control of their growing fleet to Honor, and the Peeps will never know what hit them...<br />This is a great book, the culmination of all before.  With north Hollow out of the way, Honor now takes on Grayson society and struggles to prove that she is not only a hero in war but in peace as well.<br />Honor is good as always, but, like in the last novels, I enjoyed even more reading about her friends and colleagues.  In the last book it was the Queen and White Haven as well as Henke, McKeon and crew (especially the security chief).  Now the spotlight is also on Clinkscales and Major LaFollet as well as the engineers of the Sky Dome Project, Protector Mayhew and High Admiral Matthews, and Reverend Hanks.  It is great when Harrington discovers that her flag captain will be none other than former Peep Captain Alfredo Yu (then also finds out her chief of staff is Mercedes Bingham).<br />All of these characters shine.  Mueller, Burdette, and Marchant are just as rotten as Pavel Young ever was, and danger after danger confronts Harrington from the war with Haven to the Sky Dome Project to wrangling with rival steadholders.  Of course, Honor will come out on top:  it is the journey there that is the most exciting.<br />So read this book...ers.

So she is shuttled off to what should be an inglorious assignment in the middle of nowhere.<br />But, when the nefarious agents from the People's Republic of Haven start causing trouble, Harrington is there to save the day.<br />This may sound formulaic, but it is very good.  Harrington is a very well-developed character (I like here better than Captain Kirk and almost as well as Miles Vorkosigan) and so is her treecat friend Nimitz.  But Honor, though wonderful in her own right, knows enough to surround herself with intelligent and capable colleagues such as Venizelos, Cardones, and McKeon.  I especially like the way Alistair McKeon changed from a bitter, jealous man into a mature, responsible first officer.  All readers will appreciate his role in future novels.<br />The specifics about Haven and Manticore are pretty good though at times a bit overdone.  I still don't understand every abbreviation and code word.  But that is only a trifle compared to all the good points.  Those who like background information on Manticore, Haven, past colonial history, political events, and fleet specifics, future books will expand on those topics.  I am glad for that:  there are so many characters, that it is easy to lose track.  But Weber develops his characters well and never really left me wanting.  I like the background, characters, and plot.  <br />So read the book -- it is very good, and Honor Harrington is a character worth meeting!	2003-12-07

He has no reason to believe that everything won't go according to law.  After all, the man who owes him is very wealthy.  Why would he miss such a paltry sum?  Unfortunately, the debtor, now a powerful consul, sees no reason that a &quot;true&quot; Roman should pay the likes of a Greek.  This sets off a wild ride for Hermogenes as he runs a round Rome just a step ahead of his enemies trying to collect his money and go hom in one piece.<br />The best part of the book is the setting.  Like many ancient history fiction books, the plot need not as important as the scenery.  There is plenty of historical &quot;eye candy.&quot;  Ancient Rome really comes alive -- the government buildings, prisons, centurions, city walls and gates, and even the different types of housing, both tenements and high-class villas.<br />This isn't to say that the plot suffers -- it is very good, too.  All the characters play their parts well -- the golden=hearted Hermogenes, the loyal Maerica, the merchant Crispus, the fair but tough Taurus, and the properly rotten Pollio and Rufus.<br />With both the Emperor and his right-hand man, Agrippa, absent from Rome, we get to see the rest of Rome -- its consuls, prefects, and businessmen.   The plot begins quite simply, but even when events go crazy, I still understood them.  There are not too many characters, and they are well-developed.  I especially liked the scenes in Crispus' house, describing the people who work there.  <br />I admit that the story is very pat with a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending.  Also, Hermogenes is often too good to be true.  Then again, everyone keeps calling him a &quot;strange man.&quot;<br />All in all, this is a very good book -- a good view of the ancient world and a good story.	2003-10-03

I read it anyway, and I am glad I did.  <br />The book features Lyra Belacqua, a 12-year-old living in a parallel universe that looks like our earth around 1880-1910.  Most countries have counterparts there:  England is very similar as is Oxford as well as Norway (spelled Norroway) and Svalbard.  Tartars apparently rule over parts of Russia and offer their services for hire.  There are gypsies (spelled gyptians); witches; and intelligent, armored bears.<br />All humans (but not bears, much to the chagrin of the bear king) have daemons:  like intelligent, animal familiars, their \\"better half\\" so to speak.<br />When Lyra hides in a wardrobe and overhears her uncle, Lord Asriel, a powerful British noble, talk to his colleagues about his adventures in the North, she can't wait to go there.  He isn;t so keen on her going there, and everyone seems plotting to keep her out of the action.  Her guardian, the Master of Jordan College, gives her an alethiometer, a device that read the truth and answer seemingly any question she asks it.  She is let go to serve Mrs. Coulter, the head of the Church's Oblation Board, but when Lyra finds out what her employer really does, she runs away to the gyptians who protect her.  With the help of the gyptians John Faa and Farder Coram, they launch an expedition to the North to both recover children that have been stolen away and find Lord Asriel.  In her final quest, Lyra gains the help of Texan (Texas is apparently and independent nation) aeronaut Lee Scoresby, armored bear prince Iorek Byrnison, and witch clan Queen Serafina Pekkala.  <br />Important to the story is the concept of \\"dust:\\"  elementary particles that exist inside people when they become adults (and their daemons settle on one form).  The existence of daemons (in their linked forms) seems to have an effect on dust, too.  What is this myserious dust and what has it to do with the Auroras and other worlds?<br />I really did like the story.  Lyra and her daemon, Pantalaimon, who could change shape (since her was the daemon of a child) were good characters (though not the best).  Mrs. Coulter and her henchmen were properly despicable (especially that golden monkey daemon).  Lord Asriel was properly mysterious (an excellent scholar; a lousy father).  The geogragphy of the novel is very good -- I liked the settings and different lands.  My favorite characters by far were Farder Coram and Iorek Byrnison.  Lyra was OK, but that street slang grated on me (even though I know that it was just part of the setting).  I have to admit that the way she tricked the bear king Raknuson into fighting Iorek was wonderful.<br />The book is a good story, but there are problems.  I really didn't sympathize too much or like the characters, except Farder Coram and Iorek Byrnison.  So many people were so selfish, but I guess that is the real world for you.  Also, I agree with some reviewers that Lyra's world isn't too well fleshed out.  Is their history similar in the past, too.  What about the rest of the world?  Also, what of the Church?  It's based in Geneva?  A Pope was named John Calvin?  We have Protestant elements but still a unified church?  <br />I agree that the \\"Church\\" in the book is very self-serving and reprehensible.  If Church fathers were more like \\"Farder\\" Coram, the world would be a better place.  Mrs. Coulter and the Oblation Board are so frightened of \\"dust.\\"  They equate it to \\"origianl sin\\" and seek to stamp it out my cutting the link between daemon and child.  Lord Asriel believes the same only he seeks to step into another world where dust comes from and eliminate it there.  Both are fools.  People alienate themselves form God through their actions (sin).  Some elementary dust is not going to do that!  That attitude is just an attempt to avoid responsibility.  So, Asriel is defested before he can begin.  Dust is really good!  Adults need to teach children and guide them to maturity, but just being an adult does not make one right.<br />Regarding those who felt that the book is anti-Christian, I am not so sure.  The \\"church\\" in the book is not the same as that in our world or in reality.  Even in this world, God can still be good.  That is because the Bible, though inspired by God, was written by people with their own agendas.  The Oblation Board has its own agenda:  its concept of \\"God\\" is affected by the preverted beliefs of its members.  So the true God still exists, and He has created dust which is just another manifestation of His power and glory.  Unfortunately, neither Mrs. Coulter nor Lord Asriel have this proper understanding (nor does just about anyone in the story).  The most noble characters are Farder Coram and Iorek Byrnison (Serafina Pekkala is noble enough, too).  We will hope that Lyra will grown into a noble person.<br />Is this a children's book?  No.  It could be read by young adults, but adults would understand all the imagery better.  <br />Read the book for its story, and take the theology with a grain of salt.  I know that some of Pullman's thoughts bog the story down a bit (hence a lower star rating), but his other worlds do have potential.  I hope he develops them better in the sequels.	2003-08-09
US	39782572	R17D8E3VZFP6GG	0451207173	504828940	Ruled Britannia	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Shakespeare's World Comes Alive!	I agree with another reviewer that this is the book for which to remember Turtledove.  Though I haven't read every one of his books, this is by far the best.  This is yet another historical &quot;what if&quot; book:  What if the Spanish King Philip II and his Armada had defeated the English in 1588 and occupied England?  And what if, after 9 years of occupation, the English insurgency had chosen none other than William Shakespeare to be the tool of their revolution?<br />This book has so much going for it:  conflict between England and Spain, plotting on both sides as the Englishman Cecil outsmarts the Spanish commanders, a look into daily life in London through the eyes of Shakespeare (the home, the theater, the ordinary tavern, and contemporary speech), Lope de Vega the Spanish poet and resident &quot;Don Juan,&quot; and plenty of comedy (the clown Will Kemp and the &quot;keytone cop&quot; Constable Walter Strawberry).  <br />It is true that certain notions had to be stretched a bit (e.g., Philip II keeping the defeated Elizabeth so close to home and allowing William Cecil to stay in power), but most of the &quot;what ifs&quot; were believable.  <br />The characters wre well-developed, but most were not too lovable to me.  I did like both Shakespeare and de Vega.  It was neat seeing Shakespeare transform from &quot;relative coward&quot; into a true hero.  I am glad that de Vega ended up OK, too (though his &quot;Don Juan&quot; act got a bit old).  My favorite characters were the funny ones, especially Constable Strawberry.  I didn't see why Shakespeare disliked him so; Strawberry was only doing his job.  I am glad that the Constable both showed himself smarter than expected and finally &quot;got his man.&quot;  I so couldn't stand Ingram Frizer; I am glad he got his just desserts.  I also liked Will Kemp, Richard Burbage, and Kit Marlowe (in spite of his reputation).<br />It is true that Catholics may not like the story, because of their treatment by the victorious English.  I don't think the author did it to discredit Catholics; Turtledove did it, because that's what the historical English may have done (and vice verse with the Spanish inquisition).  Even Shakespeare's quarrel was less about religion and more about politics (he admits that he might have been Catholic were it his own choice).  Still I was sorry about the player Quinn (even if he was a jerk) and the editor who were killed only because they were the wrong religion.  Neither side came off very well (even Shakespeare laments at what his own people will do after the revolution), but, I guess, that was how many people behaved then. <br />I think that this book gives a good acoount the late 16th Century England from both English and Spanish views.  Shakespeare was an excellent choice as the main character, and his interactions with his colleagues (Marlowe, Burbage, Kemp, de Vega, Phelippes, Kate, Sellis, etc.) were well written - so full of wit and poetic pieces.  I like the way the author put together other plays to write King Philip and Boudicca, too.  <br />All in all, this is a wonderful mixture of history, literary wit, and comedy.  I recommend it highly as the best of Turltedove's works.	2003-06-19

A group of \\"new-fangled\\" vampires gets invited by good but naive King Verence.  Once there they begin to take over and convince everyone (with a little help from mind control) that their way is best.<br />Once again, we have Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, Magrat Garlick, Agnes Nitt, and regulars like the rest of the Ogg family and the weird castle servants like the falconer Hodgesaargh.  But we also become introduced to new characters with staying power for future books like the Omnian priest Mightily Oats and the seemingly ever-present Igors.<br />This is not the best book, but it is a LOT better than \\"Lords and Ladies\\" and \\"Maskerade.\\"  A good solid 4 stars (of course, this is only my opinion).<br />Granny and Nanny are always a treat.  Agnes and her dual personality were very funny, too.  Once again, Granny finds a way to give the vampires a taste of their own medicine.  The vampire stereotypes were very funny, especially the lemons (I have not heard of that one before).  Igor (and other Igors) very very good, especially the way they refused to act any way but \\"tradithional.\\"  But Igors really come into their own in the book \\"Fifth Elephant.\\"<br />The vampires (except the previous \\"old count\\" at the end:  he was funny, because of his past amicable relationship with the townspeople) were not very lovable or funny:  I didn't really like any of them at all, and that was aminor complaint.  But even though the plot was dramatic and serious, there were so many individual scenes that made me burst out laughing, especially the stereotypes and the relationship between the Uberwald townspeople and the pervious vampire that they kill every 50 years or so.  And stuffing lemons in everyone's mouth was funny, especially when the townspeople kept trying to test Agnes to make sure she wasn't a vampire.<br />So, all in all, a good book and excellent development of Agnes and the Igors for future books.	2003-03-05

While this book is a &quot;Watch&quot; book, it seemed almost a kind of weird continuation from &quot;Carpe Jugulum.&quot;  Yes, there were vampires here, but more so in the background and more of a good type - on the side of justice so to speak (a rare sight before).  Here we see also the beginnings the vampire equivalent of AA and other support groups (this is even better developed in a later book &quot;The Truth&quot;).  But this book focuses more on the Uberwald dwarves and werewolves.<br />This book is good, too.  Even better than Carpe Jugulum because of one good point:  Igors.  Igors are seemingly everywhere and as quiet and nonchalant and funny as ever.  I would recommend reading this book if only to read about Igor and his &quot;family.&quot;  They are the best of the new characters.<br />Unfortunately, while Igors and Lady MArgolotta the vampire were good characters, the dwarves and werewolves were not my favorites.  The Ankh-Morpork dwarves can be funny even in their obsessions, like gold, the Uberwald dwarves were fairly mean and humorless and not likeable at all.  I wouldn't miss not hearing about them for a long time.  The same goes for the werewolves - they are a match for the elves as my least favorite type of species (except Angua, of course).  What have they to recommend them?  They are not devoid of humor like the dwarves, just morals.  Enough with the Game and the killing - it got a bit old.  How strong are they, and why?  They seemed to have even vampires beat.  Even the real wolf Gavin was a better character (OK, he was pretty good).<br />Vimes was his usual interesting self as was his wife Sibyl.  The scenery was good, as were the political repartees and the way Vimes gets his &quot;revenge&quot; of a sort with unexpected &quot;help&quot; from unexpected quarters.  But, though he outsmarts Wolf, why do all the humans keep stupidly throwing themselves at werewolves?  I suppose Carrot had to do it to give Gavin a chance to jump in and help, butwhy does Vimes not use Detritus more?  A troll can resist a werewolf.  Why didn't Vimes just send in Detritus with his bow and blow up the werewolf castle?  It's not as if that would really killed anyone?  Maybe, because of the prejudice against trolls there?  Or maybe that would have upstaged Vimes too much?  I am sure there was a reason, but I would have just gone for a frontal assault.  But I suppose that is the point - Vimes keeps us guessing, and, in the end, even Wolf couldn't keep up with his devious plans.  Hey!  That's why Vimes is a commander and diplomat.<br />Lastly, let us not forget the fat mining.  That was a funny addition, too:  Vimes telling the Low King that all he wanted for Ankh-Morporkh was fat.<br />A very good book - thanks mostly to Vimes and the Igors.	2003-03-05

This is one of my all-time favorite Discworld novels - up there with &quot;Men at Arms&quot; and &quot;Last Continent.&quot;  <br />Basically, William de Worde, younger son of one of Ankh-Morpork's most powerful rich men, seeks the truth, not only for his own class but for all levels of people.  He begins as a private reporter for foreign dignitaries and ends up opening &quot;The Ankh-Morpork Times,&quot; an upright and very nosy newspaper that seeks to find out the truth behind a plot to replace Vetinari with an impostor and take over the city.  This obviously enrages his traditional father as well as just about everyone else, including Vimes and the Watch who don;t know quite what to do with William.  Is he on their side or on his own side? Should they eliminate him or leave him alone to be useful?<br />I thought the book was very good.  Contrary to what some people say, I liked William and most of his staff.  I didn't think William was a wimpy character - at least toward the end.  He didn't compromise his principles, and he stood up to everyone - Vimes, Vetinari, the thugs Pin and Tulip, even his own father.  He is one of the few upper class characters (like Sybil and Vetinari) that are actually nice and fair.  He proves that being from a rich family does not make one an automatic snob - a refreshing point.  It is worth reading this book just to see the surprise on the faces of Vimes and the gulid leaders when Slant tells them that William is within his rights to print unfavorable news about them, and they can't censor or stop him (at least legally).  <br />While the good guys were decent characters, Pin and Tulip (especially Pin) were disgusting but not new - the usual deranged villains (like Teatime, Carcer, etc. in other books).  The -ing got a bit old, but Tulip's skill with art was funny.  I just wish the they were better cast.  Sacharissa and the dwarves were very funny, especially Goodmountain and his love for gold.  But the best of all was the vampire Otto.  It is worth it just to see a vampire photographer in action.  Watching him explode or whatever everytime he flashed the camera was funny - it didn't get old, it was funny to watch him and see how William dealt with &quot;putting him back together after.&quot;  One other minor problem - I didn't understand about the dark light, but that was just me, not Pratchett's fault.<br />All in all, a great book, even if only to see Otto.  <br />5 stars!	2003-03-05

City Watch is one of my favorite themes, so this book didn't disappoint.  There are certainly so many differnt characters here:  main ones like Vimes, Carrot, Vetinari the Patrician; other watch people like Angua, Detritus, Nobby, and Colon; and interesting minor characters like Leonard de Quirm and 71-hour Ahmed, Vimes' Klatchian counterpart.<br />A new island (later we learn not so new) has risen to the surface, and both Klatch and Ankh-Morpork claim it, even though it in itself is hardly spectacular.  It is funny to see the two groups of settlers fighting over wood and water as if it were gold.  On the surface, it looks like no contest - Klatch has a real army; Ankh-Morpork has none.  But Klatch doesn't have Vimes or Vetinari or Leonard de Quirm on their side to help them.  <br />On one hand, the rich leaders of the city under Lord Rust try to raise a real army and attack Klatch.  This is funny, especially Vimes' butler Willikins as a soldier (better than I would think).  On the other hand, Vimes smells a rat concerning an attempt on the Klatchian ambassador's life and travels to Klatch to confront his Klatchian counterpart, 71-hour Ahmed who basically seeks the same information from him.  Further, Vetinari, together with Leonard de Quirm, Colon, and Nobby, seek their own answers - they go on a submarine mission to the island to see if they can solve the problem another way.  <br />The submarine mission is very funny, especially Nobby in disguise in Klatch - it has quite an effect on him in later books.  Leonard de Quirm gets a large role here, more so than in Men at Arms.  I always like reading about the discworld's answer to the Renaissance Man.  (It gets even better in the later book &quot;The Last Hero&quot;).      <br />A good all-around book with plenty of interesting characters.	2003-03-04

This is definitely one of my favorites and my favorite Rincewind and wizards story.  <br />Rincewind, having been teleported out of Agatea, now ends up in Fourecks, the discworld &quot;Australia.&quot;  Once again, a local character takes interest in him and tries to &quot;convince&quot; him to be a hero once more.  Naturally, he tries to run away but only runs in the right direction, the one his patron wants him to go.  Fourecks in so dry that even the mention of rain makes people scratch their heads - it hasn't rained in 30,000 years!  But now the water under the ground in going away; soon there will be none left unless a hero can find a way to bring back the rain.  Of course, Rincewind doesn't know this:  he just blunders along into glory.<br />Rincewind meets all sorts of people and ideas - kangaroos, rock paintings, beer, vegemite, the opera house on the bay, sheep, desert, koalas (kind of), odd accents, opal mines, road warriors, you name it.  While Rincewond is on his strange &quot;walkabout,&quot; the other wizards (with their housekeeper) accidentally get trapped 30,000 years in the past on an island of strange animals (odd evolution).  They make it to Fourecks 30,000 years too soon and must wait for Rincewind to get them out.<br />This story had so many interesting characters (even more than Jingo).  The wizards were funny as usual, especially Ponder Stibbons trying to make sense of it all and the Bursar, to whom it already made sense.  The tension between most of the wizards and Mrs. Whitlow was funny as was the Librarian who kept sneezing himself into different shapes.<br />The best of all was Rincewind and his adventures, especially when he becomes the legend Rinso.  The sheep stealing and the jail and the local watch were a riot, especially the odd rules about the etiquette of crimes and hangings.  It seemed that everytime Rincewind ran, he stumbled into even greater glory.  The local wizard (especially the local archchancellor with the interesting name) were good, too.  But is was nice to finally see Rincewind and friends happy and on their way home at the end - until the next adventure a few books down the road. <br />Definitely a 5-star adventure!	2003-03-04

I admit, judging by the pervious books featuring Death's family (not counting Death himself), I expected to be dissapointed, but I wasn't.  This is not on a par with \\"Men at Arms,\\" but it is still good.<br />Here we have a lot of variety - Death, the Death of Rats, Death's Grandaughter, secret assassins, the Auditors,...<br />The plot was interesting.  The auditors have a nasty plan - get an assassin to kill the Hogfather, the discworld \\"Santa Claus.\\"  The assassin, Mr. Teatime (pronounce the vowels), tries to do that by getting children to disbelieve, thus negating the spirit of Hogswatch.  He tries to do that with help from the world of the tooth fairies.  Of course, Death takes it upon himself to play \\"Hogfather\\" with Albert in tow.  And his granddaughter, pretty good at beating up bogeymen and other monsters, has to stop Teatime and foil the auditors.<br />Most of this story is good.  Sto Helit, never really a milktoast like Magrat in the early Lancre books, becomes a fairly aggressive, take charge character.  It was fun to watch her wield the fireplace poker against all foes.  <br />Bilious was somewhat funny, and so was the \\"manifestation syndrome\\" of objects seemingly appearing when people mentioned them (like the \\"sock-eating demon elephant\\").  But after the first one or two times, it got too old.  Enough with these insignificant characters adding to the confusion.  Also, I know that wizards rarely make sense, but here they waste way too much time talking about non-consequentials - it becomes a big draggy and boring.  <br />The criminals are funny - especially with the brothers who live by what their mother told them.  It was funny to watch nursery-rhyme bogeys chasing grown men around screaming, and, while Teatime was not the best bad guy (although pretty good), it was great to see how Death and family finally dealt with him, and how someone finally pronounces Teatime's name correctly at the end.<br />All in all, a good book, an improvement for several characters.  But Death can usually pep up just about any story - he's just such a memorable character.  You would never see Death the same way again.<br />4 well-earned stars.	2003-02-27

And his granddaughter, pretty good at beating up bogeymen and other monsters, has to stop Teatime and foil the auditors.<br />Most of this story is good.  Sto Helit, never really a milktoast like Magrat in the early Lancre books, becomes a fairly aggressive, take charge character.  It was fun to watch her wield the fireplace poker against all foes.  <br />Bilious was somewhat funny, and so was the \\"manifestation syndrome\\" of objects seemingly appearing when people mentioned them (like the \\"sock-eating demon elephant\\").  But after the first one or two times, it got too old.  Enough with these insignificant characters adding to the confusion.  Also, I know that wizards rarely make sense, but here they waste way too much time talking about non-consequentials - it becomes a big draggy and boring.  <br />The criminals are funny - especially with the brothers who live by what their mother told them.  It was funny to watch nursery-rhyme bogeys chasing grown men around screaming, and, while Teatime was not the best bad guy (although pretty good), it was great to see how Death and family finally dealt with him, and how someone finally pronounces Teatime's name correctly at the end.<br />All in all, a good book, an improvement for several characters.  But Death can usually pep up just about any story - he's just such a memorable character.  Yopu would never see Death the same way again.<br />4 well-earned stars.	2003-02-27

Once again, I am not a fan of opera or show settings, and the Lancre books are not my favorite, so maybe that colored my review.  I do like Nanny Ogg and Greebo and, of course, Granny Weatherwax, especially when they argue.  It is also fun to see them plan together.  Greebo got to play a human again - that was funny, especially when he had to run from a mob, and the people ended up beating themselves up.<br />Agnes Nitt wasn't bad in her multiple personality character.  And &quot;Enrico Basilica&quot; was funny for a while with his &quot;Pavarotti&quot; imitation.  But that was it - I really didn't care for anyone else, most were a bit wooden and boring (especially Christine (I know you have to have a &quot;Christine&quot; for the Phantom, but...a troll would be smater than her)).  Walter Plinge was OK, too, but still a bit flat.  If it weeren't for Agnes, the opera scene would have been too boring.  That's why Granny and Nanny always need to come and liven up the story - everyone is at their funniest when dealing with them.    <br />Read the book mainly to see, once again, how Granny can hatch a plan and get her friends to cooperate.  But it is still Pratchett, and OK for him is still good.	2003-02-27

I don't think it's as good as &quot;Men at Arms,&quot; but still very nice, worth reading and watching the Watch &quot;evolve.&quot;  It's always interesting to see the new recruits.<br />This book deals with golems - pretty interesting (and strong!) characters.  There are really at least 2 main plots.  We see a plot to poison Patrician Vetinari with arsenic in candles - what a novel concept - and Vimes needs to solve it.  Also, the golems, their heads (literally) full of good ideas (and rules) - try to build a king, but too many laws and rules drive him crazy to the detriment of nayone within range of him.  <br />This book is full of goo and mud - plenty of action in the poorer, grimier parts of the city that you don't often see (except for the beggars).  The story also shows a lot about heraldry and coats of arms.  It is funny when Vimes wants to know why he is not allowed to have one and how he gets back at the &quot;King of Arms.&quot;  <br />The Watch is wonderful as usual - many different species make for interesting dynamics.  But read it to learn about the golems - I found their &quot;culture&quot; fascinating.<br />All in all, and very done work by Pratchett.  Go and read it.	2003-02-26

After \\"Men at Arms\\" this cannot compare.  OK, that isn't fair, because this is not a City Watch book.  It is like apples and oranges.  Also, I am not a fan of rock music culture, so it may be a bit my fault, too.<br />Some of the book is funny.  The troll-dwarf relationship is always good.  Glod was very funny as was Cliff.  Dibbler was his usual sales-obsessed self.  But that was about it, except for the wizards trying to wear leather.  The Dean was a riot.  And the Librarian with piano exploding (and the way it was explained to the Patrician) was great!  This is a book worth reading just to see the Librarian and his antics.  3.5 stars for him.<br />But Death was funny in the foreign legion, although it got a bit old with him running away, and Albert is not so wonderful (though he does better in later books).  I admit I didn't fully understand Death's solution to the problem with the \\"music,\\" so that didn't help.  But the Death of Rats was funny, of course.  Death, his granddaughter, Albert are not too hot here, but they improve a lot in future books, but read this book mainly for the Librarian and wizards.  They rarely fail to entertain.	2003-02-26

Really 4.5 stars, an excellent book!<br />I admit I am biased - Rincewind is one of my favorite (if not #1) characters.  This story has so much - action (and running away), battles, Rincewind, Cohen the Barbarian, the wizards, and exotic locations - this time the Agatean Empire - a lampoon of Chinese and Japanese culture.<br />Here Rincewind meets Cohen, now to be called \\"Genghis Cohen,\\" and his Silver Horde.<br />This is book is very funny in making fun of things \\"Auriental.\\"  Yes, one could be a bit put off, but it is all light-hearted.  Basically, the \\"Red Army\\" is trying to overthrow the Emperor, but they are little match for Lord Hong, a Auriental Vetinari who wants to use them as an excuse to seize power by seeiming to put down a rebellion that he encourages so that he can be a hero and crush it later.  So he helps them contact a \\"Great Wizard\\" to help them, since he always likes a challenge.  What they all get is Rincewind.<br />Rincewind meets Twoflower again, and, of course, the Luggage returns to its home.  Agatea has lots of Luggages and sapient pearwood, too.  How can Rincewind play hero (so his own allies don;t kill him) but also avoid getting killed by Hong and the armies around the capital?  How can we ask?  Rincewind is expert at running away, and when he can't, usually something turns up at the last minute.  Things really heat up when Rincewind discovers the secret of the real Red Army.  And of course Cohen helps, too.<br />Rincewind is his usual drollness.  But the best character is the man who plays Cohen's \\"accountant,\\" trying to teach his barbarian friends manners and civilization.  The best lines in the whole book are when he tries to explain to Cohen and friends that when you go to the market you need to actually pay for what you want. It is worth it just for that.<br />All in all, a wonderful book and very, very funny - even for a Rincewind book.	2003-02-26

I can say it in one word:  Carrot! He is one of my favorite heroes on the Discworld (only Rincewind and Nanny Ogg compare with Death a close third).  As usual, Carrot comes through with flying colors.  There are just so many interesting things in this book:  the plot about the \\"gonne,\\" Leonard de Quirm (and the way he acts with the Patrician), Cuddy the dwarf and Detritus the troll, the silly guildsand their ridiculous presidents, Carrot and Angua, I could just go on.  <br />Especially good was the troll-dwarf issue, the way they had to work together to interview the guilds without making complete fools of themselves and just basically get along.  Also, it is funny how intelligent trolls get in low temperatures.  <br />The plot alos makes for a nice mystery story.  Pratchett really worked on this one.  We start out with a 4-man watch and end up with one over 60 people!  The Watch really grows up and will add many laughs to future stories.  One of the best:  a must read.	2003-02-25
US	39782572	R30SV8X9NIRFTK	0061092177	497629870	Small Gods	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Evangelists and Philosophers	This book is quite unique among Pratchett's works.  It is not really part of any sub-series, although it might help the reader understand the mind of Constable Visit, Mightily Oats, and other future Omnians better in later books.<br />This book obvious parodies organized religion, in particular religion that is so entrenched that its practitioners have forgotten the spirit of their laws.  We saw this in Pratchett's 7th book &quot;Pyramids&quot; with the high priest Dios.  But this book is much, much better.  Vorbis is certainly a match for Dios, maybe even more so' he reminds me a little of a religios &quot;Patrician.&quot;  Who would want to cross him?  Brutha is a great character, not so much likeable as interesting:  so upright and calm yet willing to tell the &quot;god&quot; Om the way he should behave toward people.  And they way he and Vorbis meet at the end is great!<br />This book is not perfect - it seems to drag a bit.  I could almost feel the despair (of having to wait so long:  just like crossing a real desert) as Brutha gets tossed from danger to danger.  But that is only a minor problem.  The satire of ancient Greece through the Ephebians was good, and the philosophers were as funny as the wizards in Ankh-Morporkh ever were.  Even the way Om deals with Vorbis is a play on the real life of a famous Greek playwright.  <br />So if you like religion and philosophy twisted in a strange way, this is the book for you.  One of the best Discworld books before &quot;Men at Arms.&quot;	2003-02-23

Watching Granny and Nanny at the theater is always funny.  Here you also see other favorites like the dwarf Casanunda and the archchancellor Ridcully of the wizards.  Seeing their interplay is always funny.<br />I had little problem with the regulars - they were good as always.  The elves were certainly not likeable, not even pitiable.  How could a reader be anything but angry at them?  Unlike the dwarves, vampires, trolls, or even some werewolves, the elves seem so mailicious:  they are not even funny in any way. The only funny moment was when one elf tried to kill Hodgesaargh, but the plan backfired.  You know those hawks.<br />I suppose the best was the fact that, due to a cursory glance at the portraits of past rulers on the wall, Queen Magrat now puts on armor and acts like the \\"valkyrie\\" queen she saw.  This is good:  Magrat is now no longer a wimp; she acts like a worthy witch like Granny and Nanny.  Good for her!  She even gets to punch the elf queen!  Now that was worth it.<br />I'm sorry; I just didn't like reading about the elves - absolutely no humor.  But the regular characters make up for it. Just finding out how Granny will solve this latest problem is worth it.  Still an OK book.	2003-02-23
US	39782572	R36697JYWFBFM7	0061020621	690753180	Reaper Man	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Death is fired!	Death has been fired by the mysterious auditors, and discworld (especially Ankh-Morpork) suffers a ton of \\"undead\\" people and things.  This is especially true of the 130-year-old wizard Windle Poons who expected to die then found Death missing.  At first, the other wizards don't believe it.  It is humorous how they try to \\"help\\" Poons by burying him under the ground (under one of Ankh-Morpork's busiest intersections), and he thanks them for their persistence.  But, of course, none of ths will work without Death who is happily working with his scythe on a farm.  Naturally, Death would work well cutting grain.  <br />Here we have several plot lines:  Death being fired and, first, seeking a new job then, second, seeking to get his job back; the wizards and Windle Poons; and the problems with shopping carts and a growing magic mall that wants to take over the city.<br />I really didn't care for the mall plot line, but seeing the wimpy wizards try to act brave like soldiers was funny.  Death was funny as he adjusted to life like a normal person, just good old Bill Door (even though his appearance didn't change), and he was especially good at confronting his successor at the end.  Also, the way Poons, though dead, finally starts to \\"live\\" is funny (there are benefits to being undead).  We also meet the zombie Reg Shoe and the timid banshee Ixolite (too shy to scream, so he leaves a note under the door).  And let us not forget the Death of Rats, too.<br />So, I would really say 3.5 stars.  Though I didn't like it all, just meeting some of these characters that will come back in future books and seeeing how Death outsmarts the auditors is worth it.	2003-02-22

Genua is a city state not unlike New Orleans and its culture.  <br />Magrat, newly &quot;appointed&quot; fairy godmother, is out to fulfill a mission:  to go to Genua and stop another fairy godmother from forcing everyone to live out fairy tale lives, all with happy endings, endings dictated by the stories, not the peopl forced to live them.<br />Of course, Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax must join her to help her along.  Here is the best of the book:  Gytha Ogg and her &quot;amazing&quot; knowledge of the language and customs of every people they meet - amazing, of course, for its incorrectness, but who's going to tell a witch that she's wrong?  Needless to say, most of their hosts can't wait for them to leave as quickly as possible.<br />Granny Weatherwax is superb in the way she defeats Lilith and defies the other witch's voodoo magic.  What an iron will!  But that is why we like her.  Unfortunately, I really didn't care as much for Magrat's character.  All 3 Lancre witches act in similar ways as before.  Granny's determination and Nanny's optimism (and weird humor) I never tire of, but Magrat's wimpiness can be annoying.  She can't do it as well as say Rincewind can.  Yes, she can be funny as a counter to Granny and Nanny, and for that reason, I like her.  Though she is upright enough, I don't see her able to win here without Granny to fight for her.  OK, it is difficult with a wand that turns things into punpkins, but her character is too mushy and a bit ineffectual here, she is in way over her head.  Good thing for Granny, or ...?  It's OK.. Magrat recovers in the book &quot;Lords and Ladies.&quot;  As queen she is good.<br />So, though I didn't like Magrat as much, Nanny and Granny certainly came through (as did Greebo the cat).  The parodies of the different fairy tales were interesting.  So I really say 3.5 stars - I did like it better than &quot;Wyrd Sisters.&quot;  So this is still a good adventure worth exploring if only for Nanny's advice on foreign customs.	2003-02-22

The book is OK:  it does have its strong points.  CMOT Dibbler is always funny (and so are his relatives).  In fact, the conversations between Dibbler and his nephew? are very funny.  But I still think he is funniest as a seller of sausages and meat pies in Ankh-Morpork.  And it is funny to watch others try to eat them.  The parodying of Hollywood was very funny, especially the &quot;gold warrior&quot; whose job it is to uphold quality in movies.  It is worth it mainly to try to catch all the punnish references to Hollywood and to hear the Dibblers arguing all the time - and the 1000 elephants add to it, too.  OK, but OK for Pratchett is good for other authors.	2003-02-19

Fortunately, I started with #8 Guards, Guards! which is a first book for Pratchett's City Watch series.  The Color of Magic, though not among the best, is still good - a necessary introduction to the Discworld. This is where I first met Rincewind and the Luggage.

Once again, you see bumbling wizards, and Cutangle is funny too, especially when he talks to Granny Weatherwax.  But I still like Rincewind's first series better.

All of the watch were funny as was the Patrician (especially in the cell with the rats).  The Patrician's secretary and his makeshift wizards' club was also a riot.  And let us not forget CMOT Dibbler and the strange items he sells.  This is a must read.	2002-10-25

Death is always comical - it's hard not be when you always have to speak in uppercase letters.  Mort is a decent character, and his adventures in Sto Lat and Sto Helit are very funny. I really liked the young wizard Cutwell, too.  He was a riot.  Now we know that Death can sometimes bend the rules a bit.	2002-10-25

I wonder why, if Coin was so powerful, he couldn't just bottle up the ice giants, too, but I guess then there wouldn't be as much of a story.  Rincewind matures in this book, sacrificing himself to save the world and convince Coin of the error of his ways.  All in all, well done.  A very good read.	2002-10-25

The inept \\"wizard\\" Eric tries to summon a demon and accidentally pulls Rincewind back from the Dungeon Dimesions.  I admit that the main purpose is to bring back Rincewind.  And the story is very short - but there really is only one thread.  The best points in the story are the parts about hell (funny place) and about the take off on the Trojan War (especially Lavaeolus, the \\"rincer of winds\\").  Get the book at the library and read it: you won't be disappointed.  And if you are, it's short and over quickly.  I still say that the part about Lavaeolus is worth it by itself.  It's always funny to read about Rincewind and his ancestors (or most anything else about him).	2002-10-25

In fact, the early pages were among the most interesting.  The story about Djelibeybi, a take on ancient Egypt, was still funny at times.  But he business with the pyramids and the architects - what were they talking about (once again, maybe Pratchett meant it to sound complicated)?  It was a bit vague.  Also, I didn't really like any of the main characters (Teppic was well-meaning; I liked him better in Ankh-Morpork as an assassin), except the ghost of the late king.  The mummies were very funny at the end, though.	2002-10-25

Nanny Ogg is very funny, and so is Magrat Garlick, especially in her interactions with the Fool.  IT is so classic just to read about the three witches when they cook up spells and always argue about the ingredients.  Here we also read a lot about ghosts, in particular the dead king Verence of Lancre.  Of course, there are also all those Shakespearean gibes, especially with MacBeth.  That alone is worth reading this book.  But there is much more, much, much more...	2002-10-25

I think it was even better than the predecessor, Chaos.  After all, weren't the people of the hollow hills a kind of &quot;magic&quot; last-minute solution, too?  The giants and dwarves were among the best races Stasheff ever wrote about.  While it is true that Magnus cheats a bit with his powers to win, the stakes are high.  Alea appears to be a welcome addition to the characters.  Though many of these books are beginning to get a little formulaic (it is hard for them not to be with so many), I still think this one is an improvement over the last - but there is still much room for further improvment.	2002-07-03

Having read all three books (Mouse, Cat, and Dog), I must admit that Dan Crawford has done well in his world of Rosacotta.  This is an excellent fantasy series.  <br />The land of Rosacotta is one of extremes of good and bad.  People are cutthroat and mercenary, yet some actually care about their land.  Who is who and what one's real agenda are is something else.  This story, though confined largely to one city and one castle complex, never lacks for characters and depth.  <br />The main characters, Polijn and Nimnestl, are both outsiders to the royal court yet both become nearly indispensable in foiling plots and helping the young king and his regent.  I admit that at times I was a bit confused  as to who was who and whose plot was whose, but, then again, that's probably what the main characters were feeling, too.  And the scenes about life in the Swamp, especially those that feature the wizrd the Vielfrass, are worth reading the book in their own right.<br />I hope that this isn't the end.  Both Polijn and the king are so young.  They both deserve future volumes, maybe focusing on the realms beyond Rosacotta and on life when the regency ends and the king comes into his own.<br />A very good read. (Though it may get harder to find).  If you can get it read it.  You won't be sorry.	2002-04-19

Maybe this is why I liked it so much - many of the characters were new and unknown to me.  In fact, maybe this book would be even better for those with a good grasp of geograhy but not a photographic memory of the Civil War.  <br />The book is not perfect - at times it's a little boring regarding the incessant pep talks that both sides lead to keep up their courage (We'll lick them, of course).  Also (and this is not the author but me) where did he get that weird pantheon from with lions and all?  Why a virtual US with a pagan religion?  I suppose it's to reinforce the swords and sorcery theme.<br />The author does a good job showing the lives of ordinary soldiers, too.  <br />I thought Marching Through Peachtree better than its predecessor Sentry Peak.  I admit that since he is following real history some of the characters do have to make stupid mistakes too often. This is especially true in Sentry Peak with Thraxton the Braggart and his too idiotic mistakes, but I don't think it is as bad in the sequel.  I especially liked the characters Rollant, Smitty, Doubting George, and Roast Beef William.  And who'd ever think to see a picture of Abe Lincoln in a crown?<br />So all and all a neat adventure even if bound by real history.	2002-04-19

It took me several months, because, while not as lousy or boring as some people said, it was still a bit dragging at times.<br />In spite of poor reviews, I still am glad I read the series.

I hope this does not spoil it for any would-be readers, but I will try not to let on too much.<br />1. Good for Turtledove's efforts to develop and follow so many interesting and varied characters.  It is too bad that he does not always succeed very well.  Of course my view will be biased, but I really did like David Goldfarb, Mordecai Anielewicz, and the Yeagers (in spite of comments to the contrary by others).  But I don't really like any of the other humans.  Who cares about Auerbach and Dutourd and friends and all of Europe - it's as if the author just included them so that Europe would not feel left out.  Molotov talks a lot - big deal.  China is a little more exciting, but it's a bit boring, though I didn't mind Liu Han's charcter.  But I still read the story to see how my favorite characters came out.<br />2. Good for his development of an interesting batch of aliens - fearsome looking but quite moralistic and wishy-washy (I don't mind - I find it amusing).  Personally, I think Straha steals the show.  And I like the way aliens like Ristin and Ulhass adapt to American culture.  <br />3. Good for the happy endings that Turtledove gave almost all the main characters (I like positive endings).  He rushed a little with Drucker, and I'm sure Ttolmass and Kassquit would disagree with me about happy endings.  <br />4. Too bad for the minor obsession with ginger and ginger-dealing as well as sex.  Too much.  <br />5. Also, enough with the lizards ending every sentence regarding humans with \\"...and of course we could have beaten them...\\"  No matter how advanced humans get in the story, they never seem able to match the lizards power.  Maybe the lizards say this just to convince themselves as well, but was the balance of power that skewed?  I suppose humans will nearly catch them in a future series where they visit Home.<br />6. Lastly, Turtledove had better have another trilogy coming.  Though he did try to tie up many loose ends, he completely left the story open to a future series (you would believe that after you read the last page).  I really hope he does write a series set maybe in around 1990 where humans visit Home or something like that even if we have to suffer Jonathan Yeager again.  And if he does, please include better maps, too.<br />Don't get me wrong - I still liked the series, but I hope the next one is better and more succint.<br />PS - Kassquit is Chinese.	2002-03-06
