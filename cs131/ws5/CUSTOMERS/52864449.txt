I find her to be a wonderful alternative to some of the stuff that's in bookstores now -- her writing is unpretentious but colorful, direct yet artful. There's authenticity in these stories but I don't feel like I'm looking through a forbidden peephole to get a glimpse of her life.  Her writing might even be too good for the erotica genre but I'm glad she's writing because it restores my faith in what *can* be accomplished in sex writing.  She reminds me a little of M. Christian in that her stories are more than sex. They have depth and meaning, making the sex merely a bonus (and not all the stories actually have sex, which I think is another cool thing). Anyway, had to share.	2004-11-22

I was pleasantly surprised to find honest, heartfelt, and sometimes uncomfortable admissions of the real motivations behind the desire to write about sex. These writers (well, most of them, anyway) shed intelligent light not only on the crafting of erotica, but also on the process of writing it. They all have different reasons and rarely are they reasons you'd expect! Great idea for a book -- wish somebody had done it sooner.  Highly recommend if you're like me and love to know what makes things erotic and what makes erotica writers put pen to paper.	2004-11-22

As with any anthology, there will always be a couple of stories that aren't as appealing as others, but then, I think that's the sign of a good editor (someone who presents a diverse assortment of work). How could someone read Marilyn Jaye Lewis's story and not find it completely compelling and original, for instance?  I also loved Jill Nagle's story -- absolutely riveting.  There are definitely some memorable pieces here, so I have no problems overlooking the weaker, less interesting minority that somebody somewhere is bound to think are the best!	2004-01-29

About 80% of the recipes in this book are sure-fire successes -- they're easy to make, bursting with restaurant quality flavor, and most are quite low in carbs.  I'd have to even say this is the best of the four low carb cookbooks I own.  But here are my problems with the book:<br />1.  All the desserts use Sweet and Low, not Splenda.  A dessert made with Sweet and Low is more like a punishment than a treat -- sorry, Brennans.<br />2.  A good editor could have made the book so much better by eliminating phrases like &quot;bake until soft&quot; by replacing it with &quot;bake for ____ minutes.&quot;  There are lots of little sloppy lapses like this throughout the book.  There are also recipes where ingredients will be mentioned in the steps of the recipe that aren't listed in the ingredient list -- so you have no idea how much to use or even if it's a typo.<br />3.  The Brennans are not health professionals and should really spare the diet advice and just give us more recipes.  Anybody cooking with this book has undoubtedly done his or her homework on the low carb lifestyle and doesn't need a couple of gourmands instructing them on how to eat to be healthy.<br />I wish the Brennans would put out a second edition of this book and fix the errors in it.  It has the potential to be a superb book!  I do recommend it now -- heartily -- but think it could be so much better than it is.	2003-02-22

I couldn't help but notice an earlier reviewer who referred to this book as &quot;travel writing,&quot; which it clearly is not.
