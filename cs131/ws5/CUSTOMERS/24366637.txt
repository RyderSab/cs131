Not because it is an \\"easy read\\" but rather because it gave me a chance to visit with a dear friend who has earned his eternal rest.  Fred Rogers was and is one of the most influential persons of faith of our times; and a Presbyterian minister.<br /><br />A Pittsburgh Theological Seminary graduate, Fred Rogers found his calling to ministry in a different sort of pulpit, one that took him from fledgling public television's WQED Pittsburgh into the homes and hearts of children and all who have a childlike faith.<br /><br />Amy Hollingsworth is a pastor's wife and reporter and it was as a reporter that she first interviewed television's Mister Rogers in the early 1990s.  The interview turned out to be the beginning of a friendship between two prayer partners and Christians.<br /><br />Amy and Fred wrote and spoke often, especially when they were facing life transitions.  Sometimes they sensed from afar that the other was in special need of prayer, and then found out afterward that had indeed been the case.  Amy Hollingsworth explores some aspects of Fred's Presbyterian faith as it was expressed on the air and in his daily living.<br /><br />Hollingsworth uses the image of \\"toast strips\\" (a favorite after school childhood treat of Fred's) as the headings for many chapters that deal with his concepts of neighborhood, the importance of time, the work of the Holy Spirit, the power of forgiveness and what to do in difficult times.  Again and again, I found myself reminded of how Mister Rogers' ministry touched mine, as an exemplar of what it is to live a Christian life.<br /><br />People have asked me \\"What was Fred Rogers like in real life?\\" and the answer is, \\"Exactly the person you see on his show; even more so.\\"  Simple but always profound, caring to the utmost degree, Fred always hand-wrote his letters, always talked about things that mattered, always treated the people in his life with thoughtfulness.

One of the great traditions of the Christian Church is to take time, during Holy Week, to reflect upon the words that Jesus spoke from the Cross.  Sometimes, this happens in a three hour service on Good Friday, in which the combination of the crucifixion accounts in the four Gospels are read and interpreted in turn.  Out of this tradition, Fleming Rutledge has created a series of mediations that are helpful for personal reading, reflection and devotional use at any time of the year.<br /><br />The author, the Rev. Dr. Fleming Rutledge, is a widely acclaimed preacher, who for many years served as the preaching pastor of Grace Episcopal Church in New York City.  She now devotes her vocational life to a nationwide ministry of preaching, writing and teaching.<br /><br />A friend in ministry recommended her writings to me, and having begun reading them, I must say that I am hooked and think you will be as well.  In this slim volume, she expounds upon each of the seven words, to help the reader reflect upon what Jesus said as He died upon the cross, from \\"Father, forgive them\\" to \\"Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit\\".  Even the most familiar of these passages receives fresh treatment under Rutledge's scrutiny.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Rutledge seeks to acquaint the reader with the deep pain and humiliation of crucifixion, making the contrast of Jesus' words of hope, inspiration and promise from the cross all the more gripping.<br /><br />As those who have read Dr. Rutledge's other collections of sermons know, she is a gifted wordsmith, but her engaging words are surpassed by her rock-solid theology.  Dr. Rutledge might be called a traditionalist; her Christology is high and Presbyterians will find much in it to help elevate their own views of who Jesus is and what His saving work means for us.  Rutledge does not hesitate to show us the gritty reality of the cross, nor does she eschew disclosing the coarse realities of our own time.  For instance, \\"Sin is not a misdeed here and a misdeed there, but an autonomous, enslaving Power.  The Apostle Paul is very clear about this: `All human beings,' he writes, `both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin.' (Rom. 3:9).  In our own time, however, we have done our best to get rid of this idea.\\" (page 42).  Contrasted with these are the forceful messages and powerful accomplishments of Christ that make salvation possible for us: \\"On the Cross, Jesus voluntarily and willingly bowed His head to the power of sin...\\" (page 44).<br /><br />This book is small but mighty.  Each of the meditations conclude with a hymn, some familiar and some new, to assist the reader's reflection upon each of the scripture passages.  Not only a prized work in itself, this volume could serve as an introduction to all of Rutledge's books, perhaps the best known of which is The Bible and The New York Times.ance, \\"Sin is not a misdeed here and a misdeed there, but an autonomous, enslaving Power.

Such information is no longer breaking news; it has been with us for more than a generation.  However, the Church is still in the process of recognizing and responding (or reacting!) to the paradigm  shift.  One instinct might be to try to react to the situation by digging in one's heels and, like a dog with a bone, cling to what worked in the dim recesses of the past. In some communities, this is effective.  Even so, in many other places, churches are discovering that programs and approaches have a life of their own (one might even call it a shelf life), and that, sometimes, a fresh approach is not only warranted, but necessary, lest the church become stale.<br /><br />Author Jill Hudson presents her book When Better Isn't Enough from this standpoint, saying, \\"We must identify new criteria for success, and perhaps even for faithfulness, and hold ourselves accountable to them.\\" Hudson's view is that the Church has a marvelous opportunity for prayerful and careful response to current realities.  She identifies 12 characteristics to help us measure effective ministry today.  Moreover, Hudson presents evaluation tools based upon those 12 characteristics.  Real, practical ways that any congregation or group of leaders therein might help the church they love focus their future.<br /><br />For those who are skittish about change, Hudson makes the point clear that not changing is not an option.  She also makes it clear that insisting on all of the modes and methods of the past, without revisiting their effectiveness, will get a church into dire straits.  Instead, why not aim for a church in which some of the past will be kept and honored, some of the past will be reshaped and refreshed and some will in fact be seen as unproductive and superfluous?  A congregation that truly wishes to see its members grow and reach others for Christ can use Hudson's methods to select the right mix for their unique opportunity for ministry and mission.<br /><br />Hudson calls the church to ask questions, and indeed she has a wonderful list of them at the end of the book.  Questions a congregation's leaders and members could ask themselves about how they are listening to God's direction.  For these questions, alone, the book is well worth reading.  But only if we give them a try, to bring about God's vision for the church.<br /><br />Jill M. Hudson is a minister in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and most recently served as Executive Presbyter of the Presbytery of Whitewater Valley in Indiana.  Jill served for thirteen years as vocational staff for the Synod of Lincoln Trails.

In this lively and informative book, Les Standiford puts on record what has long been whispered in Pittsburgh and New York for more than a century.  Standiford boldly tackles the once taboo subject of H C Frick's unyielding ruthlessness, compared and contrasted with Andy Carnegie's twin desires to make himself rich enough to live like a Laird in Scotland and then to cherubically make amends as his days dwindled down.<br /><br />Happily Mr. Standiford lifts the veil and presents the truth about J G A Leishman--a likable fellow sandwiched between two clashing titans and would-be mentors.  As a student of Mr. Leishman's life and dual careers in the steel industry and international diplomacy, I was glad to see his role mentioned.  Of course, there is much more to that side of the story, including the labyrinthine way that Frick engineered Leishman's ouster and ... oddly enough, repeated almost step-by-step that same performance with Leishman's future son-in-law, James Hazen Hyde, in the Equitable Insurance scandal a decade later.  (Neither Patricia Beard in After the Ball nor H C F's descendent in the BIG book about his life go far enough in telling the whole story).  Someday, perhaps Mr. Standiford will write a sequel to this book, all about John Leishman and his family.  If so, I will be cheering him on!<br /><br />But back to this book, it is a must-read for anyone who has roots in Western Pennsylvania, anyone who wonders about the dark side of beneficent moguls and anyone who just wants to know what made these larger than life characters tick.<br /><br />The story of their two buildings in the `Burgh is worth the price of the book!<br /><br />It is, one must say, most fortunate that the imposing \\"Miss Frick\\" is no longer icily holding forth from the cobwebs at Clayton.  Now, even though he is sealed beneath tons of concrete at Homewood Cemetery, her beloved father H C cannot rest easily...  whether in hell or not...<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fictionreviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction	2005-06-16

I suspect that there is no other volume that has been read by more Christians, today, than this book-including the Bible.  Two of our congregation's adult education classes have made it part of their reading and discussion this past year.  You may very well have it on your nightstand.  The author, Rick Warren, has struck a chord in the lives of men and women everywhere, asking as the subtitle of the book says, \\"What in the world am I here for?\\"  Most every person reflects upon that question.  As the book unfolds, Warren points the reader toward answers.<br /><br />The most familiar sentence in the book is the first sentence, \\"It's not about you.\\"  I've seen it on T-shirts and bumper stickers.  Too many people don't remember the second sentence, \\"The purpose of your life is far greater than your own personal fulfillment, your peace of mind, or even happiness.\\"  The majority of persons who pick up this book are in search of all three of these.  And the book is helpful in finding them.<br /><br />But how right Warren-a 51-year-old ordained minister and founding pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California-is to point the reader toward a larger understanding.  Which is made clear in the chapter title on that same page, \\"It All Starts with God.\\"<br /><br />This makes perfect theological sense...and practical sense. When we begin to understand and appreciate the centrality of God in all of creation and in our lives, then the rest of our realities fall into their proper place.<br /><br />The author makes it clear that the book is intended to be a 40-day spiritual journey.  In the front matter there is a covenant that the reader signs to apply him or herself to that 40-day journey.  I hope everyone who reads the book will do just that.  Especially, paying attention to Day (Chapter) 23: \\"How We Grow.\\"<br /><br />Day 23 is concentrated upon Jesus molding and guiding the work of the Holy Spirit upon the believer as one matures in Christian faith and practice. As Warren says, \\"God wants you to grow up.\\"  It is also one of my favorite themes.  It cannot be said too often; for just when we feel we have \\"graduated\\" from a particular time of learning or \\"achieved\\" a goal, we fall into the sloppy thinking that we are \\"there\\"-that we have completed every bit of growth and understanding.<br /><br />Not so.  Warren says, \\"You must want to grow, decide to grow, make an effort to grow, and persist in growing.\\"  I firmly believe that anyone who takes Day 23 seriously, open to what God can do, will find their lives blessed beyond measure.  Not to mention the lives of those around them.<br /><br />So, do I recommend this book?  Yes indeed.  And if you read it when it was new in 2002 or `03 or `04, why not read it again, in 2005?  It is like a spiritual retreat that you can take whether at home or away.  A vacation better than the mountains or the seaside.  If you will, read it.  And may every day be a Day 23 for you.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.It is also one of my favorite themes.

It offers the reader a sweeping view of how the vairous eyewitnesses to Jesus of Nazareth took what they learned from Him, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, grew the Christian Church.  Michael White, who holds the Ronald Nelson Smith Chair in Classics and Christian Origins at the University of Texas at Austin, has written what ought to be a standard reference on every Christian's bookshelf. .  Moreover, lots of people are reading it; it is one of the best-received new Christian books for 2004.<br /><br />The author presents the Biblical world at the time of Christ's birth, with all of the social and religious factions that contributed to the climate in which He healed, taught, called disciples and began the movement that is Christian faith.  For those who want a less than one page, but scholarly, account of groups such as the Pharisees, Saducees, Essenes and the Zealot party, White's book offers them all, in one easy to use reference.<br /><br />I especially like the tables and outlines, both of familiar works such as Luke and Acts but also of some of the books that did not make it into the Bible, such as the so-called Gospels of Thomas and Peter.  In his review of such non-canonical works, White helps us better understand some of the conflicts that shaped the Early Church.  Decisions made then have been normative for how the majority of Christians understand our belief, down until today. If you want to know why the Christian Church has emphasized what we have about Jesus, for example, then the chapter called \\"Christology and Conflict\\" is essential reading.<br /><br />White also talks about the teachings of such Early Church leaders as Marcion.  No, we don't hear much about Marcion in the 21st century congregation, but the four issues he brought to the discussion are still with us: Emphasis on Paul's letters as the only true or normative Christian theology; rejection of the Old Testament; insisting only on Luke's Gospel to know the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth; emphasis on the proper or \\"original manuscript\\" of scripture.  Such tendencies to narrow-down and obscure the impact of the Gospel, although rejected by the Early Church, continues to influence some misguided Christian thought today.<br /><br />Moreover, White gives a good overview of how we went from house-churches to buildings that were specifically set aside for use as churches.  (I really enjoyed that part of the book, complete with photos and floor plans of recent archeological discoveries).<br /><br />This work is filled with outstanding footnotes and references for further reading.  It could be the start of much exploration into not only what made the Early Church \\"tick\\" but also what makes the present-day church what it is.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.only on Luke's Gospel to know the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth; emphasis on the proper or \\"original manuscript\\" of scripture.

There are a number of hymns in this collection that have received wide use and acceptance. They appear in eight different denominational hymnals in the US, Canada and Australia, representing the UCC, Presbyterian Church (USA), the Moravian Church and others.  These hymns are fresh, new and readily sing-able.<br />One of the most helpful is selection #5, the hymn text &quot;Bless the Ones Who Nurture Children.&quot; Originally written for the retirement of Dalles' friend Janice Anderson, who had spent a lifetime as a teacher and Christian Education Director, the hymn is perfect for the celebration of the beginning of the church school year or the dedication of church school staff. It would make good centerpiece of worship highlighting education in the church.<br />For those who are seeking a hymn text to mark other special occasions in the life of their own congregation, they might wish to consider &quot;God Bless Your Church with Strength&quot; for church anniversaries, &quot;Come, O Spirit&quot; for Pentecost and &quot;Come to Tend God's Garden&quot; for stewardship emphasis.  There are also hymns for various celebrations of the church year, including: &quot;Rejoice Behold the One True Light&quot; for Advent or a Hanging of the Greens Service; &quot;God Gather Us from Many Strands&quot; for World Communion; &quot;O God of Life, We Praise You&quot; for Trinity Sunday and &quot;Upon the Mountain Set Apart&quot; for Transfiguration.<br />Most of these hymns are set to very familiar tunes; it would be easy for congregations to sing them. Several of these hymns have also been set as anthems for choirs.  For Thanksgiving, &quot;O God Behold Your Family Here&quot; and for special music-related events &quot;Make Music for Your Lord to Hear&quot; by composer Bob Moore (featured on GIA's CD &quot;Like a Whisper in the Heart&quot;) and for Easter, John Ferguson of St. Olaf College's &quot;Easter Proclamation&quot; on GIA's CD &quot;Hidden in Humbleness&quot;.<br />The author is an ordained Presbyterian minister who has been writing hymns since 1983. He has served First Presbyterian Church of South Bend, Indiana; Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh (where most of these hymns were first sung) and for the past eight years has been the senior minister and head of staff of 1100-member Wekiva Presbyterian Church in suburban Orlando, Florida. A frequent contributor to worship journals, Dalles is a Life Member of The Hymn Society.

A modern classic both as an American novel and as an exploration of the interrelationship of faith and life, SAINT MAYBE is perhaps the greatest work by this acclaimed contemporary novelist.<br />Born in Minnesota, reared in Raleigh (NC) and infused with a slice of America mid-Atlantic milieu, Anne Tyler is the author of more than a baker's dozen of novels, and all have the ring of truth about them-from BREATHING LESSONS (awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1988) to THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST.  Here, the setting is Baltimore, the scene is a once-fashionable, now down-at-the-heels cul de sac, which serves every bit as well as the more oft-used device of an English market village for exploring what makes her extraordinarily real ordinary characters tick.<br />The story centers around a multi-generation family on this street and the others whose lives intersect their own.  Chief among them are what seem to be an offbeat, storefront church group of Christians who are having all too good a time following Jesus.  Dubbed by its founder as \\"The Church of the Second Chance\\" this congregation (with members who get as much of a kick out of forgiveness as they do picnics) can serve as a plumb line for any other church you've known or know.<br />Anne Tyler has created a lively read, but much more.  She has turned the idea of \\"church\\" slightly askew, and having done so, perhaps given us all an idea of how to set things right where we worship now.  If this is not enough to make you want to read this book (or reread it)...  Well, give it a look because it is by one of the best living writers in the English language.  And then, of course, you will want to read everything else by Tyler, too.	2004-02-17

If you shy away from Victorian novels because you had to read A TALE OF TWO CITIES in high school, it is time to give these treasures another try.  Admit it, you are a bit older now.  So are these books by Dickens, Disraeli, Thackary, Austen, the Bronte sisters, and, yes, my personal favorite, the great man himself, Anthony Trollope.<br /><br />Why read something that was written a century and a half ago?  Because Trollope knew more about the human psyche than Freud and Jung put together, and wrote about it not with a clinician's jaundiced eye, but with incredible tenderness and love.  And entertainingly, to boot!<br /><br />If you have been reading the Jan Karon novels about life in a small North Carolina highlands town, as it revolves around an Episcopal priest named Father Tim and his colorful parishioners, well!--this is where it all began.  A book version of finding the source of the Nile.<br /><br />Trollope began what Karon has revised and restyled so engagingly.  Trollope invented the \\"church and town\\" novel, with what have become known as his Bartchester Series of novels, all centering around the doings of a fictitious cathedral town and its outlying countryside.<br /><br />Not the first in the series, (it is the fourth but perhaps the best), FRAMLEY PARSONAGE traces the faith, home and political lives of a number of intertwining families.  Here you will find love, ambition, political maneuvering, gambling debts, pretension, humility, envy, forgiveness, hate, romance.  If it sounds like a slice of modern life-it is.  We and the Victorians are so much alike; the human condition does not change.<br /><br />In this delightful mix of clerical, political and romantic intrigue, you will meet everyone from the alarmingly meddlesome bishop's wife, Mrs. Proudie, to the original dizzy blond, Griselda Grantly.  All set in the green countryside and the bustling streets of London.<br /><br />The story centers around the bright, popular pastor, Mark Robarts and his charming wife, but it is his sister, Lucy, who will capture your heart as perhaps the loveliest of heroines in any novel.<br /><br />I hope you are intrigued enough to be convinced that there is more to Nineteenth Century British Literature than SILAS MARNER.  Moreover, I hope you will read this and the other Trollope works.  You may recall that in addition to being one of the most successful and acclaimed novelist of all times, Trollope was also a successful and acclaimed civil servant-his \\"day job\\" was with the British postal system-he invented the corner mailbox.  His more than 40 novels and outstanding autobiography were written in his very disciplined \\"spare time\\" in which he produced a specific number of pages every morning before departing punctually for his office.  Not only a genius of time management, Trollope was and is a guardian of the human heart.<br /><br />What?  You say you would rather start at the beginning of the Bartchester series?  By all means!  But if you do not, try FRAMLY PARSONAGE first.  Dip your toe in there-for you cannot dip your toe into any of his books without emerging the better, having done so.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.ll capture your heart as perhaps the loveliest of heroines in any novel.

Julia Cameron's Transitions strikes me as one of those books.<br /><br />Cameron is better known for her popular and sensitive book called The Artist's Way, which is a combination of creative and devotional insights and incentives for all who have the urge to paint, sculpt, build, compose and design from a faith-center.  That book has been a much-thumbed companion for many artist friends of mine.<br /><br />Transitions is perhaps a more intimate version of that better known work.  In it, Cameron offers prayers and what she calls \\"declarations\\" for a changing world.  These are presented in a form much like a daily devotional.  There is a quotation from a source familiar or obscure, followed by reflections by Cameron herself.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Cameron seeks to remind both herself and the reader that accepting change is the key to thriving through it.  She is a tender and thoughtful traveler through the various life events that some would call surprise, others would term crisis, yet all will experience at one time or another.<br /><br />For those who are convinced that change is always \\"bad\\", there are some outstanding sections on these aspects of change: abundance, clarity, compassion, courage, curiosity, expansion, happiness, love, protection, service, satisfaction and strength.  What?  You say that you had never considered these things as \\"change\\"?  All the more reason to explore what Cameron has to say about them.<br /><br />Then, there are sections having to do with relationships. I particularly like what Cameron has to say about genuine friendship.  She begins by quoting our first President George Washington on that subject:  \\"True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation.\\"  Cameron goes on to encourage us to see those relationships we call friendships in the atmosphere of values that help us determine their verity:  \\"Friendships require honesty and honesty requires courage. In all friendships there are moments when we must choose to be courageous.  ...Honesty is healing and nutritious to my heart and its friendships.\\" (pages 63-64).  Cameron invites you to respond to your yearning for those genuine friendships, which surpass the superficial, the way a solid cherry table surpasses particleboard. You sense the kinds of support Cameron offers the adventurous traveler through life.<br /><br />The reader may be surprised that Cameron quotes both well-known Christians and those of other faiths; moreover, that she brings gleams of light from cultures other than our own.  The timid reader may keep such insights at arm's length.  But to do so would miss the wonder and beauty to be had in these pages, as well as our Lord's pithy observation, \\"The Spirit blows where it will.\\"<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fictiono encourage us to see those relationships we call friendships in the atmosphere of values that help us determine their verity:  \\"Friendships require honesty and honesty requires courage.

If this idea seems strange to you, then chances are you have not read anything written by Barbara Brown Taylor.<br /><br />Taylor is an Episcopal Priest and the rector of Grace-Calvary Church in Clarksville, Georgia.  Taylor University has also named her one of the ten top preachers in the English language.  That having been said, you will also want to know that she is in great demand as a speaker.<br /><br />Dr. Taylor is a preacher of uncommon skill, but we must not stop there.  Her fresh images and stimulating ideas are so engaging that this book really can work as a personal devotional tool.  It would serve equally well as a neighborhood or small group study, or something to read with one dear friend or family member and then talk about in detail over a pot of tea or by a crackling fire.  For, just as you \\"think between the lines\\" during the course of a sermon, so too, in Taylor's book, you have the perfect chance to allow your own Christian experience to engage with the truths Taylor presents.<br /><br />If the names of each chapter, such as, \\"The Trickle Up Effect,\\" \\"How Not to Hinder God\\" and \\"Why the Boss Said No\\" begin to peak your interest, they should!  Taylor has a style that is accessible; she speaks to the modern mind and heart.<br /><br />Consider this passage, from the book's title sermon:  \\"Jesus is God's manna in the wilderness, the one who reminds us day by day that we life because God provides not what we want, necessarily, but exactly what we need: some bread, some love, some breath, some wine, a relationship with this ordinary looking man, who comes from heaven to bring life to the world.\\" (Page 11).<br /><br />I suggest reading one chapter a week, reading that chapter several times in the week, and living with the insights presented there, as a spiritual discipline.  Taylor's bread of angels will prove to be an excellent guide in your devotional life.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.e in your devotional life.

Our understanding of Scripture is built upon the inspired texts themselves.  They are the bedrock of our faith.  Over the past 2000 years, a significant body of scholarship, commentary and proclamation has been constructed above holy writ, forming what we generally think of when we consider a story or saying from God's written word.<br />We may not know whether it was Augustine, Calvin or Barclay who elucidated a passage in such a way as to help us \\"own\\" it; nonetheless, we all depend on the faithful, dedicated witnesses who have preceded us to understand what we read between Genesis 1 and Revelation 22.  Great literature has depended upon these insights; as has many of the social advances of the Christian era.<br />It is most likely that when, in our mind's ear, we \\"hear\\" Scripture, we do so in the language of the English renaissance-the beautiful cadences of the Authorized (or King James) Version.  However, remarkable discoveries have occurred since that beloved translation of the 1600s; discoveries that shed new light upon our edifice of faith.  From time to time, older, more reliable copies of this or that book or collection of books from the Bible have been found-in out of the way monasteries and ancient libraries.  Yet none of these have been as amazing as that day in 1947 when a Bedouin shepherd boy uncovered an entire cache of ancient scrolls that had remained in a desert cave near the Dead Sea for nearly 2000 years.  What his toss of a rock revealed was one of the greatest treasures of all time.<br />In this book, Kenneth Hanson recounts the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, relates the adventure of tracking many down (and losing some forevermore!), and offers the reader a first-hand account of the people who wrote and hid them.<br />Why do we care about a bunch of dusty old scrolls, and their fragments that are too fragile to touch?  Because they add their even-older corroboration of many of the Bible passages we have come to know and love.  They show how the community of faith treasured and used the texts we revere and read.  And they give us a source of greater understanding of the meaning of difficult-to-translate passages that have puzzled Christians for centuries.<br />It is a fascinating, lively account of the importance of God's written word and the people and faith it shapes.  And it points us toward the newer revisions of the King James Version (the best of which is the New Revised Standard Version)-translations that take into account the discoveries revealed in 1947.<br />If you have made up your mind that the scholar-archeology of the Indiana Jones type is a myth, then you might want to read this book; getting to know its author will be an eye-opening adventure.ow the community of faith treasured and used the texts we revere and read.

Robin Griffith-Jones takes the reader on a journey of discovery as he compares and contrasts the four chief sources of our understanding of Jesus Christ.<br />Matthew, Mark, Luke and John all answer Jesus' question, \\"Who do you say I am?\\"  And they present us with Jesus in such a way that it demands a response from us.  Even so, each of the Gospel writers answers with a distinct voice.  We are so used to hearing bits and pieces of all the Gospels; we often merge their messages.<br />Griffith-Jones invites us, instead, to see Jesus in the distinct ways he is presented in each.<br />The subtitle of the book tells us we will look at Jesus as: the Rebel, the Rabbi, the Chronicler, and the Mystic.  If these are attributes of Jesus you have not yet considered, you will want to read more about each.<br />The author is a former chaplain and professor of New Testament at Lincoln College, Oxford, now serves as Master of the Temple Church in London, one of the most influential positions in the Church of England.  He gives us the state of the world and the state of the fledgling Christian community, so we may better understand the concerns each Gospel writer addresses in their individual portraits of Christ.<br />Just as artists have cast light on particular aspects of Jesus ministry and message, so too, says Griffith-Jones, those inspired witnesses.  The Rebel who turned the world upside down, the Rabbi who taught in the tradition of Judaism yet with an authority unlike any other, the Chronicler who told the wonders of God's kingdom, and the Mystic who helped us the eternal realities behind everyday living.<br />If you want to delve into these aspects of our Lord, you will find Griffith-Jones the perfect guide.  The book is not a quick read; and you will want to keep your New Testament open as you study the contributions of the Gospel writers.	2004-02-17

He or she will say without hesitation, \\"He descended into hell.\\"<br /><br />This is a puzzling phrase for us.  If we want to have a Biblically accurate and theologically sound understanding of the most difficult phrase of the Apostle's Creed, we may wish to turn to The Book of Confessions.  Or John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion.  Or we might want to read this novel, by one of the most dazzling Christian novelists of the past (Twentieth!) century.<br /><br />Charles Williams should be better known that he is, as a brilliant scholar, inventive writer and faithful Christian of modern times.  A forceful, inventive and compelling person, Willams was a member of the famous \\"Inklings\\"-the creative Oxford University Christian writers whose company included C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien.<br /><br />The setting of the book is an affluent suburb of a large city where a group of interesting residents have prevailed upon one of their most famous neighbors, a world-renowned playwright, to produce his newest play.  We meet them all as the rehearsals are taking place-and we learn that each person is on a spiritual journey fraught with dangers, toils and snares.  There is love and lust, loss and confusion, the meaning of life and the meaning of work, all wrapped up in the preparations for performing the play.<br /><br />If Shakespeare is to be trusted, all the world's a stage...  Williams uses the metaphor of the play to portray life, in this world and the next.  So we have the world of \\"The Hill\\" (their neighborhood-but could it be any suburban enclave), intersecting with the world of the play.  We also have a larger challenge.  For, as he does in all his novels, Williams reveals the intersection between the \\"real world\\" and the spiritual realm.  Past and present at times merge.  Memory and hope combine.  People make choices that will affect their lives for all eternity.  Sometimes, without thinking.<br /><br />We meet the wise and kindly playwright, Stanhope.  The eminent and ambitious historian Wentworth.  The beguiling and mysterious Mrs. Samile.  The fear-stricken Pauline, whose perils help us grasp the key to the most famous verse in Galatians...  \\"Bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ.\\"  For that passage alone, the novel is unsurpassed.<br /><br />But you will also not want to miss Wentworth's Choice.  Classic Christian truth portrayed unforgettably.<br /><br />If you are of a literal bent, you may find it hard to wrap your mind around some of his images.  Don't give up!  Allow yourself to be guided by a pro, into a world you may not have visited before.  Read this book slower than you are accustomed to read novels.  Intersperse its reading with Biblical study on the same concepts: wholeness, healing, Christian love, jealousy, anger, fear, faithfulness, joy, life and life eternal.<br /><br />(Note:  This novel is one of a series that also includes these titles, by the same author and from the same publisher:  All Hallows Eve, War in Heaven, Many Dimensions, The Place of the Lion, The Greater Trumps).<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.thout thinking.

This is the problem M. Craig Barnes addresses in this timely book.<br /><br />Barnes writes stirringly about the need for home. He cities many studies that show the rootlessness of our contemporary society and he offers anecdotal examples of our wanderlust. Barnes explains that he experienced this collective craving among the members of his congregation while serving as a pastor in our nation's capital, often a way station for those who serve for a time in government. Everyone was from somewhere else and spoke of that somewhere else as \\"home.\\" He argues that most congregations will have this same challenge: many church members who long for a place that is far away and days that are long post, which they think of as their home.<br /><br />Barnes reminds us that our home is not Duluth or Pomona or wherever else we were born, but rather home is \\"... the place where we were created to live from eternity to eternity ... .\\" Further, Barnes tells us that \\"When God created humanity, it wasn't until he breathed the holy ruauch into the nostrils of Adam that he became a living being\\" (both p. 33).<br /><br />Not only is our rightful place with God, but God is the source of all that we are. We have come from God, we are going toward God: this is what it is to be human. Christians are the people who recognize this truth and who have as their companion on the journey God in the person of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />The author, formerly the pastor of National Presbyterian Church in Washington, DC, is currently the pastor of Shadyside Presbyterian Church, Pittsburgh.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.	2004-02-12

As we grieve for our mother or father, we often wonder where to turn to understand our feelings and our frustrations.  This is a book that can help us in the many and varied aspects our sorrow.  In Finding Your Way after Your Parent Dies, the author, Richard B. Gilbert, walks with us each step of the way.  Gilbert is a minister in the Evangelical Anglican Church in America and a specialist in bereavement care.  In this slim volume, Gilbert serves as a trusted friend in helping those who are grieving walk step by step through this particular dark valley.<br /> Although he writes primarily for those who are recently bereaved, the author has a fine chapter for those who lost a parent many years ago, in childhood, and who are now dealing with that loss as an adult.  Other chapters deal with relating to your surviving parent, how to deal with loneliness, marking appropriate boundaries, practicing healthy living, seeking counseling and the gift of time.  Each chapter concludes with a summary page that offers a brief, inspirational thought, an opportunity for doing something related to that issue, and lovely prayers.<br /> Among the very helpful aspects of the book one of the best is the long list of resources in the back, separated by the chapter topics.  It would certainly be a starting point for those who either want to explore an aspect of the book further, or who were not helped by that particular section of the book and need \\"something more.\\"  There are resources listed that are written specifically for men or for women, both of whom have specific and not necessarily similar concerns when a parent dies. When a man's father dies, for example, he is often faced not only with the reality that his turn is next, but also about how much of his life has already \\"slipped by\\".  If untended, such grief can lead to some of the more extreme behaviors of what is often dubbed a \\"midlife crisis\\".  In the back of the book there is also a selection of helpful scripture, hymns and prayers.<br /> This book may not be for everyone who is grieving for a parent; since each person grieves in her or his own way.  Certainly there are alternative, including talking to trusted family members, friends, pastors and those who have waked the same path of sorrow.  And there is a place for silence as well, a period of time when the subject is too painful to read or talk about.  While this book may not be what every recently bereaved son or daughter needs, it is a warm and empathetic book, worth considering.<br /> One final note, this is a companion to the book to Finding Your Way after Your Child Dies, from the same publisher.the back of the book there is also a selection of helpful scripture, hymns and prayers. <BR> This book may not be for everyone who is grieving for a parent; since each person grieves in her or his own way.

If there were one particular stereotype about many Christians that you could call quickly to mind, might it be that as a group we tend to be rather stern and undemonstrative in our faith?  Yes, it is a caricature; but here comes a book for us all that turns the idea of religion being dull, boring and gloomy upside-down.<br />John Piper wants us to go away from his book repeating the slogan: \\"Delight is our Duty.\\"  If that strikes you as odd, well, perhaps this book is just what you need.  Because as R. C. Sproul says, this book is  \\"...a modern manual of true spirituality\\" as it gets to how we put our faith into practice.<br />Dr. Piper is the pastor of the Bethlehem Baptist church in Minneapolis. A graduate of Wheaton College and Fuller Theological Seminary and a noted author of several previous books, he comes to us with excellent credentials for speaking to the whole church from what we might say is a conservative-to-moderate point of view.  Piper insists that there is no dividing line between duty and delight-in fact he claims that we have to find the delight in life as much as we can-it is the way that we ac God's creatures thank and bless our Creator.<br />His chapter headings can tell you a bit about where he will take you.  The first one is \\"How I Became a Christian Hedonist.\\"  Does that sound shocking?  Then read on, by all means, and find out what Dr. Piper is actually confessing, that our \\"chief end\\" is to glorify God BY enjoying God forever.  If you think that joy and faith are not compatible, that such a view might trivialize the seriousness of faith, then by all means, challenge yourself by reading more of Dr. Piper's argument-that we are to take our faith very seriously but not to take ourselves so seriously.<br />Do you find your faith to be more burdensome than joyful, more stress producing than restorative, more critical and less appreciative?  Then please...run to buy this book and read it from cover to cover while highlighting it in yellow and putting its ideas to work in your home, your workplace and your neighborhood.

Newsmakers, technological advances, media figures and language are all changing at such a rapid clip that the church is apt to speak and act in ways that miss those who need to hear the Gospel the most.  It is Leonard Sweet's contention that we must appropriate the best of the new if we are to have an authentic witness in the postmodern world.  What is the postmodern world?  While Sweet does not trace its origins, the term \\"postmodern\\" has been in common usage since the early 1970s and was popularized first in the world of architecture by Charles Jenks.  Claimants for coining it range from Charles Olson (early 1950s), Leslie Felding (1968) and Jean-François Lyotard (1984)-R. Albert Mohler, Jr. in \\"The Integrity of the Evangelical Tradition and the Challenge of the Postmodern Paradigm,\\" in The Challenge of Postmodernism: An Evangelical Engagement, edited by David Dockery (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1995), traces the origin of the term \\"postmodern\\" to Frederico de Oniz in 1934 and its first significant use in a treatise by Arnold Toynbee in 1939.<br /> Postmodernism is used to express the sense that the mid-twentieth century goals and objectives (i. e. \\"modernism\\") had been tried and either been found lacking or have outlived their usefulness. Almost every other serious field of endeavor has now borrowed the phrase, as a way of saying that time is hastening on, and the field of religion is no exception.  Leonard Sweet, is the E. Stanley Jones Professor of Evangelism at Drew University, whose prolific output includes works such as Soul Salsa and A Cup of Coffee at the SoulCafe.<br /> Sweet calls the church to become an \\"EPIC church for Epic Times\\", with the acronym EPIC standing for Experiential, Participatory, Image-Driven and Connected.  In a series of chapters devoted to each of these concepts, Sweet explores each in turn, indicating how Christians might impact the larger world more effectively, while maintaining their authentic witness to the Living Christ.  Prof. Sweet's contention is that the church is all too often a cerebral spectator, a word-driven environment disconnected from the larger community.  He cites many examples and offers some ways that the church might put into practice so as to redress these concerns.<br /> In one of the more provocative sections of the book Sweet lists the various ways that Jesus was a \\"rule-breaker\\".  All of them are Biblically correct, but one wonders if he would not have been better served to say that Jesus was a \\"rule-fulfiller\\" as in, \\"I have come not to abolish the law but to fulfill it\\". (Matthew 5:17).  Even so, Sweet's point is well taken, as in this quotation:  \\"Jesus even broke the ultimate rule: the law of sin and death\\". (Page 130). There are many good ideas in this book.  One caution, however.  A preoccupation with postmodern culture might obscure the timelessness of the Gospel by packaging it in current buzz words and topics de jour. Sweet seems to relish in knowing the latest trend or fad, but such things rarely last, whereas Jesus is the same, yesterday, today and forever.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.effectively, while maintaining their authentic witness to the Living Christ.

It is filled with inspiration and encouragement for an ongoing trusting relationship with God.  Kushner takes each phrase of the Psalm as his chapter headings, and verse by verse, provides insight and practical suggestions for how to make these truths come alive each day.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Kushner utilizes his vast knowledge of the original Hebrew text to help the reader understand the nuances of the words such as \\"soul\\" and \\"cup\\".  He explains the nuances of what the soul is and why the soul needs nourishing.  He states, \\"The world asks so much of us.  We give ourselves so totally to our work, to the task of raising our family and running a home that we often forget to take time to nourish our souls...\\" (page 61).<br /><br />The fact that God helps us \\"feel safe in an unsafe world\\" (page 50) is the Psalmist's theme, repeated and emphasized in every line.  Drawing from the world of science and literature, art and great works of theology, this deceptively small book is filled with encouragement and blessing.<br /><br />Occasionally, Christians forgo reading Jewish authors, forgetting that Judaism is the forerunner of our own faith in Jesus Christ.  That would be a mistake.  For, here, we have a work that is sacred to both of our traditions, presented by an acclaimed author, dedicated scholar and proven congregational leader.  Dr. Kushner is Rabbi Laureate of Temple Israel in Natick, Massachusetts.  He has been honored by the Christophers as one of fifty people who have made the world a better place and by Religion in American Life as their Clergyman of the Year in 1999.

Gulley is a Quaker pastor from Danville, Indiana.  And like Ms. Karon, he writes about everyday life in a small town congregation, with a master storyteller's keen eye.<br />Gully relates the odd doings of a kindly but befuddled pastor named Sam Gardner and the distinctively quirky members of his more-typical-than-one-might-admit congregation in a small Midwestern town. Since the author serves a congregation in a place not unlike the fictional pastor Gardner, his main character could be the author's, or any, pastor's alter ego.<br />Who could resist such hilarious activities as the implausible ideas that emerge from the free-for-all annual \\"Goal-Setting Sunday\\" and lengthy discussions over what color the new laminate in the ladies room vanity should be?  The book relates silly proposals that actually get voted \\"in\\" such as a new outreach initiative, the \\"Scripture Egg\\" project, in which small verses of Holy Writ are fed to chickens, so that when their eggs are broken, the verse emerged.  No, I am not making this up!<br />You will be amused by everything from near slapstick church meetings to the newspaper columnist who unwittingly sparks and flames the rumors of the town's gossip mill from his observation window overlooking the town's main street.  Any you may even be reminded of similar situations you have experienced yourself.  Because a second glance at even the most amusing of these improbable people will confirm your first suspicion: This is completely true to life.  The author knows his subject through and through.<br />This book made me laugh out loud many times, as I read about everything whimsical in Harmony, Indiana.<br />Yet there are also serious issues, addressed skillfully and sensitively, in the midst of the fun. Church members deal with unexpected prosperity and adversity.  Pastor Gulley deals with his own doubts.  His congregation (almost in spite of themselves) manages to help him find his way to firm ground.  So, the hilarity occurs in the midst of all of the other, more important work of the church of Jesus Christ, as lives are refreshed, comfort is given, prayers are prayed and the year unfolds with grace, in a very ordinary yet special place.  Even if it is indeed \\"just shy of harmony\\".in spite of themselves) manages to help him find his way to firm ground.

Dr. Metzger is also the chairman of the New Revised Standard Version (of the Bible) Translation Committee.<br /><br />With all of his academic credentials, you might think, \\"Oh dear this is going to be a dry book.\\" But that is not the case.  Dr. Metzger has written a book that is easily understood, targeted not for the professional theologian but rather for the general reader.<br /><br />While some books about Revelation err on the side of rigid timetables and several quotations from the first chapter may serve to illustrate Dr. Metzger's approach.  He says, \\"The book of Revelation is unique in appealing primarily to our imagination... Many of the details of the pictures are intended to contribute to the total impression, and are not to be isolated and interpreted with wooden literalism.\\" (page 11).  Such a statement shows the reader the straightforward and sensible approach Dr. Metzger utilizes throughout the study.<br /><br />The reader is indebted to Dr. Metzger for insights that help make the Book of Revelation less of a mystery and more of an inspiration.  He reminds us that people are represented by animals, that historical events are portrayed in terms of natural phenomena and that colors and numbers have a coded or secret meaning.  The key to understanding Revelation comes not only in breaking the code for which all of these things stand, but also, in Dr. Metzger's words, remembering that: \\"such features in the books should make us wary of turning Revelation into a kind of almanac or time chart of the last days based on the sequence of visions that John experienced.\\" (Page 19).  It serves as a corrective, both for those who have avoided Revelation, and for those who focus all of their Biblical attention upon it.<br /><br />There is a leader's guide in the back of the book which is very helpful to the reader, whether or not the book is being used in a Bible Study Class.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.s are portrayed in terms of natural phenomena and that colors and numbers have a coded or secret meaning.

God wants to speak to us about the plan He has for our lives.  His plan is a good plan, but we are in danger of missing it if we don't learn how to listen to and obey God's voice.\\"  (Page vii).  This book is Meyer's way of helping the reader learn how to do both.<br /><br />In describing ways of listening to God, Meyer lists many ways in which God speaks to us.  Many are ways that we might think of readily, such as through the Bible and prayer.  But she has a much longer list of ways that God makes God's desires known to us, from dreams and visions to the wise counsel of others, and does not fail to mention the world around us as a communicator of God's will.<br /><br />Obedience is the visible sign that we hear, love and trust God, and Meyer has a number of insights for Christians who are long on facts but short on respecting what God requires.  In fact, it is in this area that Meyer's work shines.  For example, there is an excellent section on forgiveness.  She says, \\"A woman once share with me that she asked God to give her direction concerning what God wanted her to do.  He clearly put in her heart that He wanted her to forgive her sister of an offence....  Over a period of two years, every time she asked for guidance...He gently reminded her, `I want you to forgive your sister.'  Finally, she realized that she would never grow spiritually if she didn't do the last thing God had told her to do.\\"  (Page 15).  The concept of being disciplined in reading the Word and in prayer, as well as in putting what we hear into practice, is what the book is all about.  In fact, its motto might be, as Meyer states: \\"Pray.  And obey.  Pray.  And obey\\".<br /><br />This is intended to be a deeply personal book; by this I mean that the author invites the reader to read, absorb and find spiritual renewal and growth in so doing.  Yes, there are questions for discussion at the end of each chapter, so it would also work as a small group study, but in reality, the questions are for the individual reader to ponder.  As is the whole book.<br /><br />Joyce Meyer is a popular evangelist and speaker, known for her \\"Life in the Word\\" broadcasts.  Joyce Meyer's book is a wonderful encouragement to your faith.  If you read it, I believe it will have a rewarding and renewing impact upon your faith journey.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.h in so doing.

In the world of Christian classics Orthodoxy is one of them.  It is G. K. Chesterton's account of his search for authentic Christianity in the midst of the conflicting voices of the modern world.  So it is both deeply theological and also personal, even quirky, in its critical review of the various other, opposing approaches to life.<br /><br />Chesterton was a contemporary of Leo Tolstoy, H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw.  Much of what he writes is \\"in answer\\" to them and their divergent views of the meaning of life.<br /><br />Chesterton came to a deeply held Christian faith that took its outward expression in his 1922 conversion to Roman Catholicism. Today, Chesterton is best remembered as the creator of the \\"Father Brown\\" detective stories, but he was a prolific writer, penning studies of Robert Browning (1903) and Charles Dickens (1906), novels including The Napoleon of Notting Hill (1904) and The Man Who Was Thursday (1908), poems, collected in 1927 and essays, collected in Tremendous Trifles (1909) and Come to Think of It (1930).<br /><br />In the opening chapter of Orthodoxy, Chesterton \\"eliminates the competition\\" by skewering competing world-view theories, showing their warts and all.  He then describes flawed approaches to life that will lead to despair, in the second chapter, \\"The Suicide of Thought.\\"  Having put erroneous views to rest, for the remainder of the book he describes the central truths of Christianity as the only correct way of understanding creation and human life.<br /><br />Chesterton portrays himself as one who has traveled all around the world, only to have arrived at home again as if it were some new and strange land.  \\"Home\\" being the traditions of Christian faith.  Such a journey may seem unnecessary, but you will agree that same paradox appears in everything from Dorothy's journey in the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" to T. S. Eliot in \\"Little Gidding.\\"  It is the way of human kind, according to Chesterton, to seek and to find-even if what is found was \\"there all along.\\"  (A fact echoed in Chesterton's dedication of the book \\"To My Mother\\").<br /><br />Those who read Orthodoxy will travel with Chesterton as guide-which may be the best way to go, because he is an amusing intellectual companion who has trod that way before.<br /><br />Philip Yancey wrote the foreword to this edition and claims this book transformed his Christian understanding.  If that is not enough to tempt you to read it, perhaps this quotation will:  \\"The orthodox church never took the tame course or accepted the conventions; the orthodox church was never respectable...  It is easy to be a madman; it is easy to be a heretic.  It is always easy to let the age have its head; the difficult thing is to keep one's own.\\" (page 149).<br /><br />Chesterton has been called been called \\"the prince of paradox\\" because his theology is often robed in a light, energetic, rapid-paced and whimsical style.  This was brought about to no small degree by his custom of dictating all of his writings.  (A custom, we might note, shared by none other than the Apostle Paul).<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.found was \\"there all along.\\"  (A fact echoed in Chesterton's dedication of the book \\"To My Mother\\").

It is fair to say that Lucado never disappoints the reader-his faith is deep and his words are fresh, original and marvelously chosen.  The turns of phrase conjure up entire scenes in our imagination.  For instance, he speaks of Jesus as \\"The maker of the world with a belly button\\" and \\"Heaven's human\\".  (Page 5).  He says of Jesus, \\"His vibrato made dentures rattle and rafters shake\\" (page 6).  And Lucado writes with a pastor's heart.<br />This book is an invitation to anyone who will accept it, to see what Jesus can do.  Lucado depicts Jesus as the One who unties the knots we make in life, and who is glad to hear our request for His help.  Someone with some odd characters in His family tree.  Someone who knows how we feel; who has been there Himself.  Who knew the need to get away for awhile.  Who was physically unremarkable yet spiritually unmatchable.  And One whose every concern was for you.  Lucado says Jesus is \\"not ashamed of you. Nor is he confused by you.  Your actions don't bewilder him.  Your tilted halo doesn't trouble him.\\" (Page 17).<br />The great thing about this book is that it puts the reader at ease in Christ's presence.  If Jesus is the \\"friend of flops\\" and \\"shady people\\" (we think to ourselves) then maybe, just maybe, He is our friend, too.  If he could take Matthew, a guy who \\"ranked barely above plankton on the food chain,\\" and make of him one of the founders of our faith, then (we wonder silently) what might He do with the likes of us?<br />This is emphasized in a passage Lucado uses to describe Jesus' reaching the unreached, the very people he came to save, at that party at Matthew's house:  \\"...the crowd inside tells you this is anything but a clergy conference.  Earrings on the guys and tattoos on the girls. Moussified hair.  Music that rumbles teeth roots.  And buzzing around in the middle of the group is Matthew, making more connections than an electrician....  Sinners and saints in the same room, and no one's trying to determine who is which.  But an hour or so into the evening the door opens and an icy breeze blows in. The Pharisees...the religious police and their thin-lipped piety.\\" (Pages 23 &amp; 24).<br />If that doesn't makes you want to read the rest of the book, you will be missing a rare pleasure.<br />Lucado, who is Pulpit Minister at the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, is one of the most recognized Christians in the world today, and this is one of the top best-selling religious books of 2003.s which.

The title is a good starting place, since all Christians worship \\"One God in Three Persons\\".  The various writers would have us remember the sometimes forgotten or neglected Third Person of the Trinity, namely the Holy Spirit.  This season of the Church Year (the long green liturgical season that we call \\"Ordinary Time) is when we are to pay particular attention to what the Spirit is doing in and among believers.<br />The writers are a collection of leaders from a number of denominations, Catholic and Protestant, all professors or lecturers at leading theological institutions in the United States.<br />I found Dr. L. Gregory Jones' chapter on Baptism to be especially insightful.  Dr. Jones, who is the Dean at Duke Divinity School, talks about the ongoing work of the Spirit, not limited to our baptism, but part of our lifelong Christian journey.  About what happens after Baptism, he writes, \\"The primary concern of Augustine, and others in his position...was whether the people would continue to walk in the ways of light after this catechetical journey in to baptism had been completed.\\" (page 159).<br />St. John's University professor Susan K. Wood, who writes about the act of worship, also has this helpful insight about how Jesus taught: \\"Parables, for example, reshape our imagination as they invite us to see the world and relationships in a new light.  They do not articulate rules and principles, but give us something to `see'.  They address our imagination at the same time they invert our usual way of seeing things.\\" (page 107).<br />Also helpful is the section about the divisions writing the larger church.  In a chapter called The Wounded Body, James Buckley talks about the joys and frustrations of the ecumenical movement-our longing as believers in Jesus Christ to be one, and yet our appreciation of each denomination's unique heritage and theological emphasis.<br />Suffice it to say that this is not a \\"light reading\\" book; rather it provides a depth of thought that may offer you some new insights into how God's Holy Spirit has been and is at work in the church and the world.hat may offer you some new insights into how God's Holy Spirit has been and is at work in the church and the world.	2004-02-12

Prayer is one of the many aspects of Christian life that transcend all denominational boundaries.<br /><br />Professor Guenther discusses a wide variety of topics, some that we might expect, such as varieties of prayer and retreats, and yet, from some of the subtitles you may gain a sense of her approach.  One chapter asks \\"Is Anyone Listening?\\" and another asks \\"Does what I learned in Sunday School really count?\\"  she also tackles such subjects as finding God in the ordinary places and times of life, how prayer relates to parenting, simplicity, and those dry spells when we feel forsaken.<br /><br />This is a book to be read first for its sweep of content and then to be read repeatedly as a touchstone for our own prayer life.  Not every chapter will meet us where we are today, but we will find ourselves at most of the places Professor Guenther discusses over a lifetime's prayer walk.<br /><br />Key to the book's theme is this passage: \\"I am writing about the practice of prayer,  `Practice' is a reassuringly down-to-earth word.  We practice because we are not yet perfect, because we know that we have much to learn.  To be fruitful, practice must be faithfully sustained over a long period.\\" (Page 3).<br /><br />If you have ever asked yourself, \\"Can we really be on speaking terms with God?\\" this book is for you.  I find this to be a beautifully written book.  Professor Guenther writes conversationally, so it is as if one is having a quiet talk about prayer with one who has spent the better part of a lifetime exploring its wonders.<br /><br />If there are people on your gift giving list for whom a book relating to the inward life would be appropriate, you would find this to be an appreciated gift.<br /><br />Margaret Guenther is an Episcopal priest, spiritual director and retreat leader who recently retired from the General Theological Seminary in New York City.

In it, Elaine Pagels discusses insights from the first Century AD that were well known to the Early Church but have been lost over time.  Pagels introduces twenty-first century Christians to a work that has gone unnoticed for most of the intervening centuries, the secret Gospel of Thomas.<br /><br />We already have four Gospels in the New Testament, so why might Christians want to know what is in this non-canonical book?<br /><br />Dr. Pagels, who is the Harrington Spear Paine Professor of Religion at Princeton University, says that this is a distinctive voice about the history of early Christianity.  It is original source material.  It would be like discovering a heretofore unknown history of the Revolutionary War era written by one of the Signers, only more so; since it has to do with the history of the Church of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Dr. Pagels describes the world of the Early Church in vibrant and exciting ways, in an initial chapter called \\"From the Feast of Agape to the Nicene Creed.\\"  Her account of the growth and development of the Christian faith demonstrates that it happened amid varying views and diverse ideas of how to put faith into practice.<br /><br />Pagels' contention is that there was at that time an internal debate within the Church that can be drawn along the lines of the views that are familiar to us from the Gospel of John and views in the Gospel of Thomas.  The debate centered upon what is most important about spiritual and religious expression-and what following Jesus meant, long before the books to be included in the New Testament were agreed upon.  While John's Gospel famously speaks of Christ as Light dwelling within all beings and the source of all creation, the Gospel of Thomas speaks of Christ as \\"hidden good news\\" in much the same way that Jesus told of the treasure hidden in the field, the tiny mustard seed and the pearl of great price.<br /><br />The Gospel of Thomas is unfamiliar to us because it is one of about fifty early Christian texts that went missing in ancient days and have only recently come to light.  So, like other information that antique its unfamiliarity may strike us as both unusual and incorrect.  But it also helps us understand the decisions in the Early Church that led to the theology of John's Gospel to come to the fore and the information in this other work to recede into the background.<br /><br />Beyond the historical information, what else might we glean from this book?  Perhaps Dr. Pagels says it best.  The book offers \\"insights or intimations of the divine that validate themselves in experience-what we might call hits and glimpses...\\"  (page 183).

Ms. L'Engle invites the reader to focus on that which is great, greater and greatest, in a world that all too often settles for what is dishonorable, unjust, impure, ugly, discourteous, shoddy and worthy of condemnation.  In both her fiction and non-fiction writings, she helps the thinking Christian look at the world through the eyes of faith.<br /><br />Ms. L'Engle takes as the theme of the book, Jesus' invitation to Peter to come to Christ walking on the water.  For a brief moment, Peter did just that.  Ms. L'Engle states that is how we were created to be, and even when we sink, and cry for help, that Jesus will pull us up.  She says, \\"The impossible still happens to us, often during the work, sometimes when we are so tired that inadvertently we let down all the barriers we have built up.  (Page 238).<br /><br />Ms. L'Engle views the creative process as a successive letting down of barriers.  Of opening to God.  When one responds to the urge to create, one is one more than holy ground-one walks on water-since God is the Creator and God's creative energies are limitless and surprising.  God's very unpredictability and joy become the same creative force in musicians and artists of all kinds.  Ms. L'Engle speaks of the freedom to laugh at ourselves as one of the prerequisites for bringing about that which is worthwhile.<br /><br />Lest we mistakenly think that Ms. L'Engle's approach is sweetly sentimental, listen to what she says about the rigors of faithful creativity, \\"Complicated creatures we are, aware of only the smallest fragment of ourselves; seeking good and yet far too often unable to tell the difference between right and wrong; misunderstanding each other and so blundering into the tragedies of warring nations, horrendous discrepancies between rich and poor, and the idiocy of a divided Christendom.\\"  (Page 153).<br /><br />This would be an outstanding book to give or receive for a special occasion such as graduation or confirmation.  For Christians of any stage in life, \\"Walking on Water\\" is a call to live expectantly and trustingly.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fictionmisunderstanding each other and so blundering into the tragedies of warring nations, horrendous discrepancies between rich and poor, and the idiocy of a divided Christendom.\\"  (Page 153).

In this thoughtful book, author Bruce Feiler goes on a journey of discovery, both in the ancient texts of these three religions and in the footsteps of Abraham, to understand the man and his meanings for our own day.  And he invites the reader to share the journey with him.<br /><br />It may seem self-evident for Christians steeped in the Old Testament that one would look to Genesis for the stories about Abraham.  And in many ways they do serve as Feiler's starting point and main thrust.  However, what soon becomes apparent is that Abraham is so revered by so many diverse peoples that a whole body of oral tradition about Abraham exists beyond the sacred page.  Feiler shares many of these insights with us, and since he is not limited by the passages of Scripture, there is a richness in his revelations about the man who first insisted there is but one God.<br /><br />As this book unfolds, we learn about the geography of Abraham and also the impact that geography has upon his saga.  We are invited into passages that are familiar to us, but with an eye to what the Jewish or Muslim perceptive on those well-known passages might be.  We see the story of Hagar and Ishmael in new ways, as Feiler points out the ramifications of the first-born son's legacy, in ancient terms.<br /><br />We also meet modern day guides, whose sharing of parts of Feiler's journey of discovery gives us further insights into the patriarch's story.<br /><br />Here is just one quote that shows the ways in which Feiler asks us to look beyond what we have already experienced in the person Abraham:<br /><br />\\"Hollywood has been particularly neglectful of Abraham.  Moses merits a Cecil B. DeMille epic and a DreamWorks animated blockbuster.  Steven Speilberg and Harrison Ford spent an entire film looking for the lost ark of the covenant...  But no Abraham.  Yet Abraham's life would seem to fit the three-act mold that Hollywood demands.  Act one is his early life...  Act two is his picaresque adventures on the road to Egypt and back...  Act three-the most action packed of all-(is the one) in which Abraham is trapped in a deadly love triangle...\\" (page 70).<br /><br />This book is timely and informative, but it is more.  It invites us to look for ways to incorporate Abraham's story into our own.<br />Bruce Feiler writes for the \\"New York Times\\", the \\"Washington Post\\" and \\"Gourmet\\" magazines.  He has authored a number of other laudable books, including \\"Walking the Bible\\".  A native of Savannah, Georgia, Feiler has a great sensitivity to the nuances of similarities and differences between the world's great religions.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.ld that Hollywood demands.

US	24366637	R39VOOGN86X1HN	0595152252	222277178	How to Survive Being a Presbyterian!: A Merry Manual Celebrating the Funny Foibles of the Frozen Chosen	Books	4	9	10	N	N	The Joys of Being Presbyterian	If you want a lighthearted look at the joys and idiosyncrasies of being a Presbyterian, this book is for you.  Bob Reed takes our \\"Presbyterian Culture\\" and talks about it in ways that will have most long time Presbyterians giggling and nodding our heads.<br /><br />His subtitle of the book is \\"A Merry Manual Celebrating the Funny Foibles of the Frozen Chosen.\\"  If you \\"take exception\\" to that nickname, well, so do I; but moving beyond it you will read and reflect upon all sorts of things that make us Presbyterian that do not appear in, say, the Book of Order or the creeds and confessions of our denomination.<br /><br />The cover has two sidebars that say \\"Secrets Revealed!\\" and \\"Now it can be told!\\"-All in good fun, Bob Reed tells us the distinctive and sometimes hilarious things that make Presbyterians Presbyterian.  From Reed's take on the Presbyterian dress code to \\"A Presbyterian's Idea of Hell on Earth\\" there is much that will give you a chance to think about what matters to us, and wonder just why in the world it does!<br /><br />Author Reed has a vivid imagination and he has invented a little imaginary Presbyterian friend, called Percy T. Presby.  Dressed in clothing you might expect to see in Colonial Williamsburg, from the three-corner hat down to the buckles on his shoes, Percy takes us all on a journey of discovery of Presbyterianism.  Percy is very much like a Presbyterian version of Ben Franklin's \\"Poor Richard\\" (as in Poor Richard's Almanac), with all kinds of short memorable, one-liners.<br /><br />These pithy quotations would be great discussion starters round the table or in a meeting...  Here is an example:  \\"Percy T. Presby's Thoughts About Meetings: `When it is apparent that the vote on an issue will me unanimous, there will usually be one negative vote, because many Presbyterians think unanimity on anything is probably against God's will.'\\" (page 46).<br /><br />Whether you are brand new to the wonderful world of the Presbyterian Church or have been a part of it from the cradle roll on, you will find much to ponder and enjoy.  Also included is \\"the Presbyterian National Anthem\\"-no I will not have our choir sing it for you-but it is also worth a chuckle.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fictionl on, you will find much to ponder and enjoy.
