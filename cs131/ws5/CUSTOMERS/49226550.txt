Princess CeNedra is a wonderful creation, definitely one of the more colorful and vivid characters in the series. She adds a new element to the story, and readers take a sly pleasure in knowing exactly what Garion and CeNedra's destiny is while the two unwitting youths stumble closer to each other. Eddings masterfully weaves this semi-subplot into the ongoing saga of Garion, Belgarath and Polgara.  <br />The story telling is crisp and without frills again, causing the action to move swiftly and the reader to be drawn in immediately. Description and setting are done well, but not overdone to the point of stagnating the story. Subplots move along swiftly--unlike the plodding of Robert Jordan.  <br />All in all, an excellent episode in the ongoing saga of the Belgariad.	2005-05-12

However, if you crave straightforward storytelling in which setting, character and plot are unfolded at a steady, entertaining pace, this is the right book for you. Heck, this is the right series for you. I'll even go so far as to say this is the right author for you. Eddings doesn't let himself or his stories get bogged down in endless description of the nice little world he has created. Rather, he has a lot of story to tell and he tells it crisply and with steady determination. His characters reveal humanity at just the right intervals, drawing us readers into the story deftly. Eddings has returned to good versus evil, magic and destiny (like the old, delicious fantasy of our younger years).  <br />As for this book specifically, it continues the Belgariad quite satisfyingly. Garion does seem a little bit slow at times, but really, is it easy for a young man to come to terms with being the King of the World? Polgara steps up in this addition also, adding to our knowledge of the way magic works in this universe. Honestly, the fringe characters are my favorite thing about this series. Destinies intertwine wonderfully as one man fights the beast within while another avoids his birthright at all costs.  <br />All in all, thoroughly enjoyable reading.	2005-05-09

The book opens with a glimpse into the vastness of the universe Eddings has created here. Mythology sets the tone of this story and adds a vast perspective to the doings of these characters. The reader meets a young, unassuming boy named Garion, who has no idea of his destiny, although Eddings tastefully reveals glimpses of said destiny to the reader. We follow Garion and his Aunt Pol and other characters through the beginning of the exciting journey that lasts through all five of the books of The Belgariad.  <br />Eddings creates fully fleshed out characters with deft charm. He finds perfect moments for humor, seeming to effortlessly weave the proper level of tension into the story and relationships.  <br />Easily the best aspect of these books and all of Eddings's books is that Mr. Eddings has mastered the skill and art of crisp storytelling. He doesn't lack for details, but there is so much story told in such a no-nonsense manner that the pace naturally stays fast. Mr. Eddings creates setting wonderfully, packing precise description into two or three sentences and then letting the story and the characters show us any more needed details.  <br />We don't have David Drake here folks. Drake tells a good story and hits on all the technical aspects, but he just gets bogged down with every little detail he wants to mention. Eddings tells a slick, highly entertaining, deeply involving story with characters you come to love.	2005-05-04

Skipping the summary (which you probably read above) let's get to the meat. Those readers who met John Grisham and fell in love with his novels starting with The Firm will be pleased to see the man get back into legal thrills. Unfortunately, they will possibly be disappointed that the legal thriller aspects are few and far between. As many Grisham readers know, he has recently taken to writing more sentimental, personal, poignant novels (A Painted House and Bleachers), and with this novel he does the same. He has fairly successfully married the two approaches and styles with this novel. Unfortunately, the lovingly painted southern town life is too loving and long. Grisham needed to restrain himself and 'revise down' as my writing coach often said. About fifty to 100 less pages would have been far more appropriate to the actual story told.  <br />Some might disagree and say that our modern media audience is too distractable, but the fact is that the actual story that Grisham tells is pretty simple and small.  <br />Less words and faster pace would have polished this novel to a five star shine.	2005-03-10

Obould is a smart orc and he has come to power and wants the Northlands for himself. What's new about this? Orcs usually have only wanted to kill kill kill, but this Obould has a vision.

Salvatore is the final book in the Hunter's Blades Trilogy. It is a well written examination of the Hunter (Drizz't) and his relationship with his blades... or in other words, of how Drizz't has chosen to deal with the world around him. Readers know that Obould, the orc king, is a powerful new enemy, so we will not go there in this review. <br />However, it is possible that Salvatore has created his best villain ever here. Obould has almost transcended base evil and is practically living on a higher plane of existence. The question is not \\"How do we kill him?\\" but is rather \\"Can and should he be killed?\\"  <br />Salvatore leads us to interesting questions and answers throughout this book. However, the action is still strong and vivid, the characters continue as believable and beloved, and the reader is sucked in quickly. The stakes are high, both on the kingdom level and the personal level, for all those involved.  <br />A good, swift read that will leave you breathless and thinking.	2004-12-23

If you are looking into beginning the DemonWars Saga, don't start with this one! Start at the beginning and you will gain a knowledge of the rich, multi-textured world that Salvatore has created. He is the master of showing, not telling. In this book, Salvatore has created a story following Brynn, Aydrian Wyndon's schoolmate, in her quest to free her homeland, at the same time that Aydrian is trying to assume control over Honce-the-Bear. We read about Aydrian's efforts in Ascendence, and now we read about Brynn's doings in Transcendence. <BR>Salvatore keeps the action steady and moves the story along at a fast clip, keeping the reader eager to see the plot unfold. His subplots involving the Chezru Chieftain's dark secret and the Jhesta Tu and the dragon keep the experience full and very interesting. We meet some wonderful new characters in Pagonel, Cazzira and Agradeleous. Characters we are familiar with continue in their own personal arc and we find ourselves cheering for Juraviel and his growing joy. <BR>The only weakness this book has is the lack of faith that Salvatore's publishers have in the reader. I wanted him to have taken a little more time with the conclusion, and I feel like he wanted to, but his publishers doubted his readers would want to read an even longer book. The fact is, I read this book in four days, while I read the Wishsong of Shannara in two weeks. Both books are of the same length, but Salvatore is much more adept at plot spinning and character development. <BR>Finally, the battle scenes with their large scale depictment and intimate step by step scenes are outstanding.	2004-02-07

With Ryan flying everywhere and finding himself in Moscow at the unexpected and satisfying conclusion, readers will applaud another great story.<BR>Strengths: Several subplots are woven seamlessly into a strong finish.

We get a better look at those crazy monks who re-direct wasted time, particularly Lu Tze. We also meet Lobsang, Jeremy Clockson, a Lady, and we see the Auditors again. Death, again, is one of the best characters ever. <BR>The story centers around a young clock maker being commissioned to make the most accurate clock in the Universe, down to the last tick. Problem is, with a clock like that, a bad person could control time. Lu Tze, sweeper extraordinaire, and his assistant Lobsang are off to the rescue. <BR>With a spinning plot that touches on physics, the nature of time, and chocolate, Thief of Time is at times confusing. You've got to pay attention! But have faith, the conclusion brings it all together. <BR>For those familiar with Pratchett and the Discworld, there are many funny moments, but you won't be in pain like you were with Eric.

As a father, I sympathized with his feelings about his son. As a husband, I sympathized with his feelings about his marital relationship. As a son, ditto ditto ditto. However, this book is also a mystery, sort of. The issue is: was the main character's father murdered? At least, that is kind of the issue. Sub-issues and mysteries include why an Aunt is the way she is, why a brother acts so oddly, how much of the father's outward appearance is truth and how much is falsehood? When Carter gets into the action of the book, the writing shines. I want to see him write a straight mystery, because this man can pull it off.<BR>The problem is that he spends too much time repeating himself on relationship issues and reinforcing the impression that our hero has the right ideas about race. While it was refreshing to see what the author feels about race and racism, I didn't care for it in the setting of a mystery book. <BR>Two books: one a relationship drama and the other a mystery. They could have been blended and shortened more effectively. And finally, the writing itself is crisp and effective for the most part.	2004-01-21

You can actually read this before you read Odds Against, as I did, and still keep up with the goings on.<BR>The reason that this is one of the best books by Dick Francis is that he keeps to his nice formula of the underrated guy kicking the bad-guys' trash because he is just tough and sharp as nails; but in addition to his formula, Francis takes us deep into Sid's character and shows us a guy we love. We root for him more than any other Francis character because we know him better and can see some of ourselves in him. The plot as always is clean with some neat twists.

The plot starts simply enough, with Vimes having a conversation with a hapless assassin. Thereafter however, the we follow Vimes back in time to the day that he joined the Watch. <BR>This is one of the more moving books Pratchett has written.

Folks, you know the story. Read this book to see Rowling take a fairly good character, Harry Potter, and make him more rounded and absolutely more realistic. Harry is having a bad streak because he is a teenager who is not getting a whole lot of respect. The fight against Voldemort is the central plot of this story, rather than a rough school year at Hogwarts. The stakes are raised very well by Rowling. Obviously Rowling did not want to cave to those hurrying her along and it paid off in this book. It is richer and deeper than the others. The only thing missing was the nice whimsy and humor from the previous four. Perhaps that would have detracted, but I think it might have lent the serious parts more impact.

The quest idea is wonderful and there are times that the action clicks and flows very nicely, somewhat reminiscent of old RPGs like AD&amp;D. Brooks needs to have spent some more time editing, and this book could be about half the length and still spend plenty of time on plot and character development. He is too wordy and at times contradictory in his descriptions. <br />The world is well thought out and the quest is enjoyable. Some character motivations are never fully brought to light.

Problem is, the dialogue is just  ridiculous for the first hundred or so pages. Don't give up on it. The  story unfolds at a good clip, with only a couple parts that make you wonder  about the characters' intelligence. As with all of Ludlum's heroes, Drew  Latham is  practically superhuman in ability, but that is acceptable  because the story is really outstanding. If you really like Ludlum, it is  worth reading this book. There is some vintage Ludlum action and twists,  not quite enough, but it is there. Read it.	2000-08-22

Feist takes risks with his characters and the story line that really pay off. If you want to not have a life for a few hours, read this book, because you won't be able to tear yourself away. The  story of Pug and his maturing is great fun! Feist packs his story full of  great detail and fast paced action. The battle scenes are breathtakingly  depicted. Read it.	2000-07-17

Cadderly is so much a non-hero that it is easy to actually identify realistically with him. But he uses his  intelligence and his courage to go after every problem he encounters. This  novel will draw you along with its great characterizations and inventive  plot. Salvatore does use much of the general ingredients, but he mixes in  his own special blend of descriptive and colorful spice. Read it for sure,  but be ready to be addicted to the series!	2000-07-14

This set of books rocked my world. I got into fantasy and soon after got my hands on this trilogy. I consumed them in about a week.  It is true that the plots are somewhat predictable, especially the whooping the good guys  give the bad guys at the end, but the journey to that point is thrilling!  The stories and characters carry you along with them into a different  world. I was sad when I finished this series. This is a good place to start  the Forgotten Realms stuff. &quot;The Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot; is a  better place, but this one is awesome. Read it.	2000-07-14

This book, the first in the most readable of all the Forgotten Realms series, is out of sight. Not only does Salvatore layer on a great plot and colorful action and scene, he is a  master of character development. It soon becomes clear that we can't help  but feel for everyone of his characters. This series launched a worldwide  interest in one of the greatest fantasy characters ever also! Drizz't  Dourden, a dark elf who explores the meaning of good fully. This book is an  emotionally charged, fast-paced read that is out of any other fantasy  adventure title. Read it for sure!	2000-07-14

I think you would love this book and its partners in trilogy. Holy heck! You find yourself caring about these warriors that other authors merely use as slicers and dicers.

Nightshade's hatred seems a bit over the top, but I guess that is her character. Again, Ben is confounded by things he can't understand  and he doesn't really know what to do, even though it is clear to the  reader what is going on, down to Nightshade's sidekick. But the plot is  well developed and the mud puppy bit is a great addition! Poor Abernathy.  Enough said. Read this one. You really must.	2000-07-13

The black unicorn as a dreaded creature was a nice touch. Brooks, as expected, set a great scene and developed his plot very well. But Ben is kinda thick in the head. The  secret of the unicorns is kind of obvious I think to the average reader,  but it takes them forever to figure it out. Oh well, still a great addition  to this light reading series. Read it!	2000-07-13

I had to read it. I was addicted to the series. The story is great. Goodkind has a great imagination that can  develop an idea into an entire novel! His pacing slows with this book,  except for a few parts. You want to smack your head because of some of the  things that happen. Also, you wonder if it is supposed to be so obvious  that Goodkind is basically taking our world and putting a new name on it in  his world. Well, that is okay, because he does it all with skill,  believability and a sensitivity to character that is rare. This book is  interesting in that it fleshes out Goodkind's world, gives us some more  amusing antics between Zedd and his lady friend, and develops the rather  long plotline of the Jagang fellow. However, Richard does pull the final  solution pretty out of the air, but he has done that before and the sword  helps him do so, so that is acceptable. To sum up, it is a readable and  enjoyable book and I hope the next one is the last one. I am ready for the  series to end. I hope Goodkind has enough dough in the bank to feel ready  too. I look forward to seeing his great skills involved in wrapping up this  addictive story of wonderful characters! &quot;Soul of the Fire&quot; is a  good book with Goodkind's trademark plotting ability! Read it.	2000-07-13

Mr. Goodkind had me convinced that his plots were going to get fairly predictable, but he had also convinced me to keep reading by making his characters so vivid and keeping the plots well paced and wonderfully  set. However, with this book, I was surprised with the things that Goodkind  included, and the plot is the best yet since the first one in the series!  The rest of Goodkind's wonderful storytelling talent is also on display in  this book also. However, one does wish that the sex was a great deal less  and that he used his wonderful talent to allude and etc. I won't but these  books, but I will borrow them from a library! At least you can skim the  graphically narrated sex scenes and get on with the story without any  problem. Truly, Nadine and Drefan were a nice twist in this tale. One also  wishes that Richard and Kahlan could just trust each other more, but at  least Goodkind makes the feelings of betrayal well motivated. Anyway, this  one is well worth the night of sleep you will lose. Read it.	2000-07-13

It focuses more on Kahlan, and that is good, because she has become one of the  strongest female protagonists in all fantasy since Mercedes Lackey's  Paksennarion. The adventure and action is all very fast paced and  colorfully done. One wishes that Goodkind would do more allusion than  detail when it comes to some graphic items, but you can bypass the  particularly extra scenes, as it were. Definately worth the money and time.  Read it.	2000-07-13

I found this the best plotted one of the series! I loved it. The characters' explorations in their prison are wonderfully done, especially  those they make into themselves. I think Brooks put more meat in this one,  and that is why I like it so much. You gotta read this one. It is  definately the most satisfying of the bunch, with the G'Home Gnomes being  the coolest part of the book practically. Read it.	2000-07-13

It took me a couple tries to finally understand what happened at the end of the book, and that is the only detraction I have! Alec's pain is raw  and movingly depicted in this book. I didn't think Walter Farley had that  kind of cathartic writing ability at all, but he really pulled it off. The  reader can follow poor Alec through the pain of loss and then come to terms  with it as he does. Farley did it! This book is a must read if you want to  end the series right. Read it.	2000-07-12

This book is one of my favorites of all time. I read this book and was addicted. Goodkind spins a perfectly plotted tale of a young man being thrown into something way out of his  league. The story is excellent and the characters are well done. The  strongest point is the setting. Goodkind paints vivid pictures and you can  easily picture where the people are, without being bothered by too much  description. The world that Goodkind has created is also compelling and a  lot of fun to get to know. This book is a very good read. Read it.	2000-07-12

But this book still scores high points on plot, setting and characterization. The reader has no trouble  caring about Richard, Kahlan or their friends and is quickly drawn into  what they are involved in. Goodkind has great skill with his  characterizations!

Ludlum scales down his scope and tightens up the suspense!  You should not pick up this book if you need sleep.

It's best ingredient is the vivid imagination of Mr. Ludlum and his ability to weave a fine plot and have it unfold at a good pace. This book hits the same key that many others  do: Nazis and the Third Reich, but it is very original in plot and hero, or  as it were, heroine. The ending isn't necessarily what you might expect  from Ludlum, but it is definately appropriate. This is worth your plane  ride, so read it.	2000-07-11

This, the final in Ludlum's best series of books, is definately worth its weight in the food you forget to eat! Ludlum succeeds in making a character human! Jason Bourne/ David Webb is a fleshed out character with the doubts  and worries that all people have! His concern for his family, his worry for  them, his desire to be done with the whole assassin racket; all of these  combine to give this man a believable and human motivation to finally have  a showdown with his mortal enemy, the Jackal. This book takes the reader to  all parts of the world and is wonderfully plotted. How does Ludlum do it?  This is a taut, fast-paced, heavy breathing conclusion to Ludlum's greatest  espionage victory. Read it.	2000-07-11

This was the second Ludlum book I read and it iced my addiction cake! Who is this man who was filled with bullets? The book is filled to the brim with questions and Ludlum doesn't answer them until it would be cruel and  unusual punishment to not do so!  Jason Bourne as a character is very well  done! His self-doubts are believable. Even though the romance is a bit over  the top, the book is such a great read you don't even notice it until you  are done. I have read this book a few times now, and each time I am  engrossed in Bourne's search for his identity amidst a storm of intrigue  and death. Ludlum put everything in this one and spares no plot twist. It  is flawless and you must read it now! Read it!	2000-07-11

Ludlum does very well helping the reader go through the same things that  Noel Holcroft goes through. Ludlum has created and developed a great plot  here too.

It  is true that the ending is a little cliche, but this book is well worth it!  I haven't read The Matarese Countdown, but this book makes me want to. This  is a classic Ludlum page turner, even though it is a little predictable at  times. Ludlum draws his readers in and then takes them on quite a ride.

However, Matlock is sort of carbon and he doesn't seem  to have a whole lot of brains. But that is excusable, because the book is  interesting and compelling. Ludlum does well with his narrative. Read this  book if you want to say you have read all of his, and if you are dying for  a pretty good read that will keep you up at night.	2000-07-10

This is a smart, fast-paced, entirely plausible page-turning thriller of the first order!  This is one of Ludlum's best, just behind the Bourne  trilogy. Sure, Ludlum's heroes seem to be almost superhuman in intelligence  and capacity, but no one can match the sheer tension that Robert Ludlum  writes into his stories. This is a long tale that you almost wish didn't  end. Converse's involvement in the case is believable portrayed, and the  only real detraction is the easiness of Joel and his ex's relationship.  Read it.	2000-07-06

I was struck by the different style that he had at the beginning of the book, but it captivated me. Man O War is the greatest horse that ever lived. After reading this book you might find yourself waiting to see horse races in the hopes of seeing another  horse to match Big Red, but you will be disappointed. I read this book for  the first time as a grade schooler and couldn't get the lump out of my  throat for the whole day after I finished it. Farley puts the history down  in a sensitive and deeply felt manner. He fills out the story with his  knack for writing and developing plots and characters. A must read!	2000-07-06

My favorite horses in the world by my very favorite author! It started well, but somehow it didn't grip as well as all the rest of Farley's.  Still worth the price and the read, but not up to the Farley par. The story is good, but the details don't wrap me  up, and the tension doesn't build as strongly. Read it anyway.	2000-07-06

I wished I could be Alec Ramsey and have my own stallion as a best friend! Walter Farley's classic is just the beginning of a wonderful series that can't be interrupted. If you pick up this book, settle down to a maniacal search for  the rest of the series!	2000-07-06

With this novel, his first in a wonderful series, Terry Goodkind has invented new magic, introduced us to a captivating world, and shown us his amazing ability to keep his reader  biting his or her nails. I couldn't put this book down. I became obsessed  with reading the rest of the series, to the point my wife wondered about my  sanity. A joke. However, Goodkind has created extremely believable  characters that the reader can care about.  His story lines are  outstanding.  Sometimes you wonder why Richard seems to be so thick here  and there, and that is the only detraction I have!  I recommend this book  to anyone who loves good reading.	2000-07-05

I picked it up and have never forgotten it.   Some have said that the first two chapters are difficult to get through, but for me this was not the case. I found that they set the tone of the book perfectly.   De Bernieres is in absolute control of the language in this book. He is also in absolute control of tone. His depiction of Il Duce is so scathing and humorous, but at the same time seems to be a good read of Mussolini.   At the same time moving and hilarious, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of the most perfectly written books I have read.   de Bernieres' prose is unrivaled in its fluidity, clarity, and intelligence.  He changes tone like nothing I have ever seen. I laughed out loud while  reading on a public bus, and before I arrived at my stop, I was almost in  tears from the moving narrative. Read this book and you will count yourself  lucky.  However, I recommend not seeing the movie, despite what your curiosity might urge you to do. My curiosity got the better of me and I was deeply disappointed.   Of course, how do you capture perfect prose in a movie?	2000-07-05
