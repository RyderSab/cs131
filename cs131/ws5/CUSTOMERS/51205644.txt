This is a book likely to make almost any reader angry - whether Muslim or not. It portrays the Islamic world as essentially hostile to women, and it puzzles over the power that fundamentalist Islam holds over younger educated women living in Middle Eastern countries. With a journalist's eye and ear tuned to the incongruous, contradictory, and mean-spirited in the many cultures that make up the realm of Islam, she sometimes reacts with irony, dismay, and outrage at what she observes, especially when it takes the form of defiance against internationally recognized women's rights, a dogmatic and misguided effort she finds little support for in the teachings and practices of the Prophet.<br /><br />At the same time, readers will become familiar with the \\"family values\\" of Islam in its extremist forms. The enforced modesty of head-to-toe drapery is a mild constraint compared to the rigid restrictions that confine women to their homes, their behavior modified by beatings, as needed, their husbands free to take multiple wives, and divorce any of them merely by pronouncing the marriage over. Meanwhile, contact with any male outside the family constitutes dishonor so profound that it is grounds for murder. Brooks also devotes a horrific chapter to the widespread practice of genital mutilation.<br /><br />Written before 9/11 and the War in Iraq, this book was a clear warning to any western politician who failed to grasp the rage of the Islamic world against the evil that the West represents there. It's not too late to read and ponder it now.	2005-10-06

Readers expecting insights into Islamic spirituality will find this a different kind of book. Its first half describes a long visit to Marrakesh during which the author is the house guest of an old friend who is a shop owner in the Old City's bazaar. A recent convert to Islam in California, Wolfe discovers how the teachings of Muhammad infuse the daily life and culture of this Moroccan city.<br /><br />The second half of the book describes his own hadj (pilgrimage) to Mecca, where millions of the faithful gather once each year from around the world for a week and more of religious ritual and visits to sacred sites as guests of the Saudi government. Rather than the recounting of a spiritual experience, however, Wolfe's narrative is a detailed report of things seen, heard, and felt, much like a travelogue. The decision may have been to reserve comment on the impact of hadj on his own faith, but it's an unexpected choice.<br /><br />More curious is Wolfe's uncritical acceptance of the male-dominated culture he describes. Men and men only go together to mosque for prayers, and the pilgrims he travels with are all male. Except for his friend Mostopha's wife, who seems always to be cooking and keeping house, women hardly figure in his book, even his own wife back home, who gets scarcely a mention. Meanwhile, he praises the classless and color-blind egalitarianism of hadj as it's observed, while failing to make note of his privilege as an American, able to afford rooms in the comfort of air-conditioned hotels while the poor sleep rough at night, sometimes in tunnels only inches from passing traffic. The shortcomings of other religions notwithstanding, these are odd oversights, even for the 1990s, when it was first published.<br /><br />Still, for non-Muslims, this is as close as one can get to an experience of pilgrimage to Mecca. And Wolfe does readers a service by observing so closely and sharing so much. For an account of hadj from a woman's point of view, read Asra Nomani's \\"Standing Alone in Mecca.\\"ra Nomani's \\"Standing Alone in Mecca.\\"	2005-09-26

Readers have compared this classic modern Persian novel to the works of Poe's fevered imagination. Its hero is delusional, obsessed, and maybe totally mad. The narrative is dream-like in structure, which is to say layered, circular, and driven by its own demented logic.<br /><br />If that's not enough, the far-from-reliable narrator has fiercely psychotic conflicts regarding women. The author may well be commenting on the deep divisions between men and women in his culture, where attraction is balanced against profound distrust. His narrator is either idealizing women or portraying them as evil incarnate.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there are episodes of black comedy, one involving identical twin men locked in a room with a cobra. And the cycling and recycling of nightmarish images, each as if occurring for the first time, offers an ironic motif of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Recommended to lovers of the surreal who enjoy puzzling over the meanings of dreams, whether personal or effusions of the collective unconscious.	2005-09-21

The story of Abraham marks the emergence in human history of monotheism, and idea that represents a major shift in human consciousness. For believers in a single deity, it's an idea whose simplicity gives it an integrity that is self-evident. Three thousand years later, the complexity of not one but myriad Abrahams confounds understanding of the one God he believed in.<br /><br />Feiler's informative book gives us in broad brushstrokes an account of how that transformation took place. His search for common ground between competing belief systems takes him on a perplexing journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land, where he interviews men and women who have devoted their lives to study of God and the descendants of Abraham. The answers he gets to his questions illuminate his subject and raise even further questions.<br /><br />At first I didn't think I was going to like this book. I expected something scholarly, and this seemed more like magazine writing - breezy and superficial. Then as Feiler wades into deeper theological and political waters, the subject became compelling and full of unexpected surprises. I recommend this very readable book for readers with even a passing knowledge of Abraham, the ancestral father of three world faiths, and who wonder at the current ferocity of religious beliefs that haunts our days.	2005-09-13

This book, set in the Islamic Republic of Iran, should be required reading for anyone hoping to understand the complexities of current events there. Leaping backward and forward in history, the author, de Bellaigue, examines 25 years of revolution, as overshadowed by centuries of political and religious conflict. The fall of the Shah, Khomeini's rise to power, and the shifting alliances after his death resolve into a new kind of monarchy that, in the opinion of de Bellaigue and those he interviews, has betrayed the Revolution. Meanwhile, his images of Tehran - the city and its people - form a dramatic mosaic as richly varied as Dickens' London.<br /><br />The book's title is a reference to the Iran-Iraq War, when tens of thousands of young, poorly-trained, under-equipped Iranian men gave up their lives in mostly ill-conceived and unrealistic military ventures. In the account of this decade-long bloodletting, de Bellaigue makes clear that the carnage was the result of both blind religious devotion and the utter failure of leadership. Years later, while survivors suffer respiratory failure from Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons, the memory of that time and the magnitude of sacrifice sadly and ironically fade. The only significant achievement of the Revolution and war with Western-backed Iraq has been a hard-won independence from foreign powers.<br /><br />De Bellaigue, an English journalist, casts himself as a stranger in a strange land and rarely regards anyone (there are a few remarkable exceptions) with anything but a skeptical eye. He hopes for an Iran that is true to the democratic ideals that inspired the Revolution, and he makes no secret of his contempt for Western governments that have undermined Iran's sovereignty. But the truth is elusive in this place where reality routinely takes a back seat to appearances. Whether talking to veterans of the War, the daughter of murdered dissidents, the parents of a young \\"martyr,\\" or an African-American Muslim living in Iran, he illuminates his subject compellingly. I highly recommend this absorbing and well-written book.living in Iran, he illuminates his subject compellingly. I highly recommend this absorbing and well-written book.	2005-09-06

Although written mainly for an American Muslim audience, Nomani's book tells an absorbing story for other readers whose knowledge of Islam is limited by whatever happens to be the day's news. Nomani, best described as a reformer within the American Muslim community, accomplishes two things: describing in detail the compelling experience of hajj (a pilgrimage with her family to Mecca in post-9/11 Saudi Arabia) and opening the doors of the mosque to reveal the fiercely intense political struggles that are currently being waged there between hard-line conservatives and moderates.<br /><br />The polarizing issue (and its magnitude may surprise some readers) is the role of women in the mosque, where the near absolute dominance of men prevents women from worshiping as equals before the Creator. Simply insisting on the right to enter by the front door of her family's mosque in Morgantown, WV, causes an uproar, and her Bill of Rights for Women in Mosques has the impact of Luther's 95 Theses in shaking the foundations of rigidly held Islamic dogma.<br /><br />Meanwhile gender intolerance, as she notes, is accompanied by the anti-Western, anti-democratic politicizing of Islam that is being advocated within the walls of many mosques in America. Hers is a disturbing account of a religious community under siege. Nomani is not a scholar, and her book is more the story of a personal journey than a reasoned argument in support of toleration, compassion, and equality, which she holds as the core values of Islam now betrayed by religious extremists.<br /><br />Along the way, she struggles with doubts and uncertainties, confronts obstacles, and over a period of time (2001-2004) overcomes barriers both within and without to assume leadership as an advocate for Muslim women's rights. It's easy to find fault with aspects of this book, and many are noted in the other reviews posted here. While her story is fascinating and worth reading by anyone wanting to understand more deeply the political and cultural complexities of Islam both in the world and here in the U.S., it's probably not the only one a person should read.he political and cultural complexities of Islam both in the world and here in the U.S., it's probably not the only one a person should read.	2005-08-29

Here the hero is not a fighter pilot (\\"The Hunters\\") or an alpine mountain climber (\\"Solo Faces\\") but a lover, whose intensely erotic affair with a young French woman is imagined by the novel's narrator, a casual friend who scarcely knows him. Phillip Dean (like a real-life counterpart James Dean) is in his twenties, good looking, intelligent, and with a fatal attraction to fast cars. (Dean Moriarty of Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\" also comes to mind.)<br /><br />As a movie, this would be NC-17 material. Far from romance, it's a graphic portrayal of the unpredictable interplay of desires and emotions between two people physically attracted to each other. And in its fascination with the shifting moods of lovers consumed by their passions, it is \\"very French.\\"<br /><br />Though published, and apparently set, in the 1960s, the book captures the look and feel of post-war France. The provincial towns where it takes place are lifeless and silent, seemingly exhausted. Salter's gift for seizing sharply drawn impressions from fleeting images makes the settings almost jump from the page. Written in present tense, his sentences are short and often fragmentary. While evoking the great weight of history, his images have the immediacy of the present. An American reader who has traveled in Europe will recognize the emotions Salter describes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the story is layered with ironies. The narrator himself seems to have a life that is almost empty of eros, and he reminds us that for all its graphic detail, he has imagined all the intimacies of Dean and Anne-Marie's affair. Maybe the lesson in this has to do with our own perceived inadequacies and voyeuristic curiosity about the private lives of others, especially celebrities and public figures. Almost 40 years later, Salter's novel stands up very well today, its vision and its ambiguities more pointed than ever.	2005-08-22

The somber cover, the title, and the reference to prison abuses at the opening of this book are a little misleading. This memoir is not especially dark or grim, and the journey it recounts is an internal one, more from the land of \\"yes\\" than \\"no.\\" It captures that particular youthful optimism that buoys up children and adolescents in the worst of times. And the Islamic revolution in Iran becomes the worst of times for the community of 100,000 Jews living in Tehran in the late 1970s, as the monarchy is toppled and the Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile to assume power.<br /><br />Hakakian's book is a vividly and wonderfully remembered account of her coming of age in these tumultuous years. The equally gifted younger sister of three precocious brothers, an admitted \\"class clown,\\" she happily plays her own growing self-confidence and self-awareness against the reader's knowledge of coming events. Through her, we experience the almost universal public euphoria that followed the fall of the Shah, and while she chooses to discount its significance, we see mounting evidence of the approaching political and social forces that will finally drive her family to join the Jewish exodus from Iran.<br /><br />This is a fine, well-written book, often entertaining and sometimes starkly moving. The parallels Hakakian draws to Orwell's \\"1984\\" illustrate the gradual erosion of self that occurs when the state attempts to control individuals' thoughts and desires. In this and other ways, it's an excellent companion to Nafisi's \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran.\\"	2005-08-19

This is an absorbing account of the author's divided identity as a Muslim woman who grew up in Iran in the 1960s-1970s and then remained in the U.S. where she was a university student at the time of the revolution. Now married to an American and working as a journalist, she is torn by her desire to return to the beloved Iran of her youth, its 3,000-year-old culture, and the large, loving family who still live there.<br /><br />The strictures imposed on women in the Islamic Republic (the rigidly puritanical dress codes, the denial of social equality for women) are only a part of the difficulties she faces as she begins a series of return visits to Iran in 1990. The dominance of the West in the material values of educated and upper middle class Iranians has been replaced by the tyranny of the fundamentalist and hard-line religious leaders who dictate social policy. The dominance of the West in controlling Iran's oil-rich economy through the CIA-installed monarchy has been replaced by the social and economic upheaval brought on by years of war with Iraq and isolation in the world community.<br /><br />With all this in the background, Asayesh articulates the human toll resulting from the revolution by describing its impact on the lives of the members of her family. She reveals this most vividly by contrasting her idyllic childhood against the realities of the present. Everywhere there is division, right down to her own efforts to recover a personal identity. Her sense of self is continually frustrated by the lack of continuity between the memories of her life as a girl and her current life in the West. Asayesh has a journalist's eye for detail that takes the reader beneath the surface of her subject and any easy generalizations about the Islamic Republic. It's an excellent book to read after Nafisi's \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran.\\"	2005-08-16

This is a wonderfully entertaining memoir by a writer who could be a stand-up comic. Her account of growing up Iranian in Southern California tells again a story told many times in many ways by children of immigrants to the U.S. Prominent is her father, Kazem, a petroleum engineer with patriarchal quirks that make him both endearing and exasperating. There is her mother, Nazireh, whose English \\"has to be translated into English\\" and in the way of mothers everywhere is an embarrassment to her thoroughly Americanized teenage daughter. And then there is the extended family, a multitude of loving aunts, uncles and cousins.<br /><br />Much of the humor in the book concerns the adjustments to life in America and the comic strangeness of a strange land, where people react to an unfamiliar name by refusing to say it (the author gives up her Persian name for a while and calls herself Julie) and believe you come from a land where there are camels and beautiful cats (Persian, of course). And there is much to learn about Iranian culture - the celebration of Persian New Year's, Persian food, and Persian weddings.<br /><br />There are adventures - getting lost at Disneyland, a vacation in the Bahamas during the excesses of Spring Break, a summer in Paris, and a trip to Washington D.C. to be confronted by murderous anti-Shah demonstrators. There's also the impact of the revolution and the taking of American hostages in Tehran. But she even finds ways to find humor in the sudden anti-Iranian sentiment that swept the U.S. during those years. Everyone, as she says in the last chapter (an addition to the paperback edition) has a story to tell - and hers is both a comic joy and a pleasure to read.	2005-08-12

Western artist Bob Pummill is a resident of Kerrville, Texas, a gifted cowboy artist who has served as president of the Cowboy Artists of America. The 150 reproductions of his oils and watercolors in this handsome collection are a tribute to the tradition established by Charles Russell, with its emphasis on the cowboy and the Old West of cattle drives and ranching. More than capturing the often dramatic mood of time and place, his paintings are strongly narrative like Russell's, telling stories that represent the Code of the West in its many aspects.<br /><br />His cowboys and horses are alive and memorable, and he places them against landscapes that are often breathtaking in their distances and the play of light, shadow and color in vast skies. The cattle are typically longhorns. The seasons range from early spring to late winter, and he seems to have captured nearly every time of day and night. More romantic than realistic, they are full of satisfying detail. \\"Roundup Camp\\" shows a chuckwagon and cook with six cowboys sitting on the ground eating, while a campfire burns at the center of the picture and glancing through the limbs of a tree are the last rays of the setting sun. The ground is covered with sparse vegetation and beavertail cactus. The sky is a delicate peach color and the distant hills are blue. As your eye lingers on the details, off to one side you finally discover it - a work dog, lying flat out and exhausted on the grass.<br /><br />This terrific book has running text by Michael Duty, currently executive director of the Dallas Historical Society, and previous executive director of the National Western Art Foundation. Like an excellent museum guide, he takes readers from painting to painting with his appreciative commentary, pointing out the details and the artistry. An excellent oversize book, with hours of pleasure for any Western enthusiast.	2005-08-10

Author Schaffert crafts sentences in a beguiling way, piling up details and creating situations with the logic of dreams, propelling the reader along, until the book becomes a lot like getting lost in a fun house. And looking back at vantage points in the narrative, it doesn't all make a lot of sense. The Rollow Sisters (Mabel, not her real name; and Lily) don't have \\"phantom limbs\\" except in some metaphorical sense that's left to the reader to puzzle out. Abandoned by every member of their family (one of them a suicide) the two young women live in a house crammed with mostly worthless junk for sale, which clutters the story itself in fascinating detail.<br /><br />Meanwhile, their heads are filled with another kind of clutter - attitudes, poses, bits of storylines from movies, magazines, tabloids, and a dozen other forms of popular culture. The two of them inhabit a world of imagination in a suspended state of arrested development. One of them suddenly leaves with a boyfriend in search of their mother. The other becomes strangely involved with a grieving family of brothers. Recommended for readers who like out of the ordinary and not so obvious fiction that keeps you guessing how all the pieces will eventually fit together.	2005-08-08

This is not gritty realism or \\"Cops\\"-like docudrama. Instead, author McNally's sensibility lies somewhere between the blue-collar melancholy of Raymond Carver and the outrageous humor of Hunter Thompson. His characters (all males in their early teens to their thirties) are comically pathetic, living lives that barely hang together. Teenagers Hank and Ralph appear in three stories set on the Southside of Chicago, obsessed with girls (who are all repelled by the two boys) and spending their aimless days and nights on the ragged boundary line between adolescent angst and Big Trouble. Roger, a UPS driver, moves blankly through empty days haunted darkly by thoughts of Squeaky Fromme and Charles Manson, while a fellow worker runs a personal ad and discovers the liberating mysteries of \\"raw carnality.\\" Meanwhile, romantic relationships and marriages languish and sour.<br /><br />Far from being bleak, the wonky dialogue and cock-eyed situations in these stories had me laughing out loud. In my favorite story, a debt-ridden young English instructor is beleaguered at work by witless students and an annoying, politically-correct faculty and then harassed at his new home by a neighborhood bully. All comes unglued for him at a faculty party where he gets entirely too drunk. Only the last longer story, \\"Limbs,\\" shows McNally stretching himself into something more novel-like, as he explores the disintegrating impact of a murder on the lives of several small-town people, and here there are few laughs, just a dizzying descent into confusion and rage.<br /><br />I love this book. It is both disturbing and fiercely entertaining.	2005-08-08

This collection of ten early short stories by Barry Lopez seems written more than a little under the influence of Borges. Elegantly told, they are designed to evoke a deep sense of wonder in the reader. The settings are often remote - the open prairie, the desert - and touch on what feel like the remote worlds of other cultures and other times, especially Native American.<br /><br />The title story refers to the Indian practice of keeping a record of tribal history by representing the one most significant event of each year as a picture on a buffalo robe. In this story, a modern-day scholar immersed in the subject of this lost tradition is himself lost and out of place at a conference of academics.<br /><br />One man becomes fascinated by a French mansion built on the Montana-North Dakota border in the 1860s. Another, an early explorer of the West, attempts to uncover the mystery of a disappearing river in 1840s Nebraska. Still another, in the 1960s - like a chapter out of Castaneda - finds an Indian in the Arizona desert, who conjures a vision of the universe from an arrangement of stones lying in the sand. In the small-scale domesticities of modern fiction, it's hard to find imaginative writing of this kind. I highly recommend these stories as an escape from the everyday and the ordinary.	2005-07-28

There are books by scientists and nature writers that inspire an attitude of awe and wonder, and they do it with a graceful style of coolly elegant prose. This is not one of those books. Janovy, a University of Nebraska biologist specializing in parasitology, is often awestruck by nature, but his style is wonky and comically ironic, using the kind of classroom lecture technique meant to engage undergraduates by seeming to be anything but reverential about subjects he loves, enjoys, and deeply cares about.<br /><br />Unscientifically, he personalizes and humanizes the species he discusses (termites, snails, fish, birds) and even the places where he and his students do their field work - the Platte River, the waters of man-made Lake McConaughy, the streams and marshes that feed into it, and the Nebraska Sandhills. And there are references as well to beer drinking, the Doors, and Waylon Jennings. He refers to himself sometimes in the third person and easily reveals his own embarrassments and frustrations as his attempts to unravel nature's mysteries are sometimes less than successful. Waxing philosophical at nearly every turn, he eventually reaches a state of mind he calls the \\"Ogallala blues.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, like a great teacher who inspires with his enthusiasms, he opens a world unknown to anyone unaware of the subtle and complex relationships between species. And he's able to do this by focusing on just a few life forms, including one-celled animals, in a small area of western Nebraska. Janovy invites you to take the nearest exit ramp within range of open fields and streams  - even a patch of weeds - and just feast your senses on the flora and fauna. His book is full of fascinating material for the nonbiologist and a pleasure to read.	2005-07-28

Reading it is like spending time with a new friend. Nicholson has a sharp and curious mind and a generous spirit. You may not think you can be much interested in a group of three little islands in the Outer Hebrides - the Shiants - their climate, wildlife, prehistory, geology, archeology, socio-economics, agriculture, shepherding, folk literature, the sea currents around them, and the host of other topics covered in this book, but Nicholson draws you in. Soon you are immersed in whatever there is to be known about what amounts to less than a square mile of rock, cliffs, beach, and meadow.<br /><br />The book is organized around the turn of the year, beginning with Nicholson's first journey to the islands in his own boat in the spring, and ending with the first gusty wet weather of autumn, as he sits at the window in a two-room cottage writing. Into this annual cycle he interweaves story upon story, often speculative, of how the islands came to be, how they came to be what they are, and the people over thousands of years who have lived here.<br /><br />As the year passes, Nicholson sketches in the broad sweep of recorded history from St. Columba to the present, noting the several hands through which the islands have passed, including his father's and his own. A team of archeologists identifies the remains of Iron and Bronze Age settlements and spends a summer uncovering a long abandoned farmstead. The discovery of a buried cobblestone with an ancient inscription sends him on one of many attempts to unravel mysteries that he uncovers.<br /><br />The book is based on considerable research, and Nicholson pieces together a previously unwritten history of the islands with references drawn from many old documents and interviews with historians and other experts. He helpfully illustrates his text with many photographs, drawings, and maps.<br /><br />This book is for anyone who feels the magical pull of islands. You will not regard them quite the same way again.quite the same way again.	2005-07-18

It was a monumental act of generosity that kept the North Platte Canteen in operation from 1941 to 1945, offering food, drink, and gratitude to the multitude of troop trains carrying young servicemen through Nebraska during WWII. Greene's book is a tribute to those who made it possible - a scrapbook of memories recalled by men and women who are now in their 70s, 80s and older.<br /><br />Through scores of interviews, he is able to capture again the excitement, the emotions, and the utter innocence of that place and time. Just 10-20 minutes - as men burst from the trains, were welcomed with home cooking and smiles, and then dashed back onboard again - are remembered 60 years later by men who have never forgotten and often dissolve into tears as they try to explain what it meant to them, no more than boys then, far from home and family.<br /><br />The book is written in a breezy Sunday supplement style, and social historians may desire a bit more objectivity. Oddly, Greene never explains how he located all the former servicemen he interviewed. And finally, it's not all feel good. Greene notes how time has changed North Platte, symbolized in the deserted downtown and the absent train depot, torn down long ago. \\"Dust in the wind,\\" he muses sadly at the end. But like an old photograph, there is his book to preserve the memory that \\"once upon a town\\" it all really did happen.	2005-07-13

Ward's storytelling is something like Alice Hoffman's, with darker moments out of Joyce Carol Oates. There are long internal passages as characters think, feel, and wonder restlessly, yearning for love, attention, someone - anyone - to care about them and lift the veil of loneliness surrounding them. When they talk to each other, they seldom say what they really mean. Their world is frozen like the deep Nebraska winter of 1958, in which the Starkweather murders take place.<br /><br />The theme of loneliness, emotional abandonment, and the obsessive desire for love are played out in several story lines, all reflections of young Caril Ann Fugate's fatal attraction to the boy with a gun who romances her and draws her along in his bloody wake. Readers who find her parts of the novel compelling (and they are), will discover that Ward devotes far more of the book to less dramatic characters and situations, which are interesting only as they parallel or intersect with the account of  Caril Ann and Charlie. Crime fiction fans will find these stretches of the novel slow going.<br /><br />Curiously, Ward reimagines the Starkweather-Fugate story - as if the actual events lack a narrative integrity of their own. The two young people were eventually arrested not \\"outside Valentine\\" but in Douglas, Wyoming, after fleeing across the entire length of Nebraska. Readers interested in the story of that flight will find instead a more reflective and thoughtful study of the human heart.	2005-07-13

This book is a collection of the author's notes, impressions, vignettes, short essays and verbal fragments (he calls them \\"sketches\\"). They were written during 1983-86 as Gilfillian crisscrossed the Great Plains from Canada to Texas (he says he drove 50,000 miles), stopping here and there - sometimes in cities and small towns, sometimes off-road - to take out a sharpened pencil and note what was there to be \\"noticed.\\"<br /><br />Gilfillian is a poet with language, and his perceptions are informed by a wide knowledge of music, literature and civilizations past and present. Each piece can be read multiple times, like poems, to wring more meaning and feeling from them. The stories he draws on from Indian history are often compelling. And I especially enjoyed his longer essay on the Nebraska Sandhills, along with thoughts about the Nebraska writers Willa Cather and Mari Sandoz.<br /><br />Recommended reading for anyone fascinated by the vastness of the high plains and its impact on those who have lived there - in a splendid kind of isolation.

The title of this well-written memoir is misleading. It's less about moving out than it is about staying put and doing the best you can with what you've got. The author's moving out (leaving a marriage of 40 years) occurs in the closing chapters, after she has lived a life as wife and mother, married to a rancher in the northern Nebraska Panhandle.<br /><br />Polly Spence (1914-1998) grew up in Franklin, Nebraska, the daughter of a small-town newspaper editor and of Irish immigrants. This is Willa Cather country and you can recognize the kind of shallow social world found in Cather's \\"One of Ours\\" and Sinclair Lewis' \\"Main Street,\\" a place where small minded men dress up in white robes and the city fathers have to confront an insurgence of the KKK.<br /><br />In her senior year, the author's family moves suddenly to western Nebraska, where she meets the man she marries - both of them just out of high school. The year, 1929, marks the beginning of a long hard-won struggle to make a go of it, both as ranchers and as a family, as she becomes the mother of three boys in quick order. Determined, strong-willed, and independent, Spence eventually faults herself for being too much like her mother - rigid in her beliefs and unyielding in her temper. Yet, given the circumstances of her life, it's hard to see how she might have lived it differently.<br /><br />There are moments of sudden and terrible personal loss in her story that will leave readers stunned, even if reading between the lines you can see them coming. (I didn't.) Finally, hers is the account of a life lived with a kind of courage that confronts obstacles without flinching. The account of her later years in Los Angles is something of an epilogue to the achievements of her life raising a family in the isolated grasslands of high plains Nebraska.<br /><br />Thanks to the University of Nebraska Press for seeing this find book into print.

Part memoir, part travelogue, Norton's book centers around her family's cabin on a small lake on the edge of the Nebraska Sandhills. The story is told in three parts: her childhood at the lake in the 1950s and 60s, a sojourn there in 1984 where she sets out to write a thesis and settles instead into a job at a small-town bar and becomes romantically involved with a man she meets there, and a return visit several years later as she crisscrosses the Sandhills gathering material for a book.<br /><br />Read uncritically, the book is a rhapsody of appreciation for the beauty of the Sandhills and a story of recovery, from a violent sexual assault far from home and a subsequent period of hard drinking and restless wandering. It speaks of the healing powers of nature and of the search for a lost self through memories of childhood innocence.<br /><br />Read more critically, the book often doesn't quite follow through with some of the themes it puts forward. I wanted to know more about her relationship with her mother after her parents' divorce, an event that shattered Norris' world. While her accounts of the men she came to know there as an adult (most of them cowboys who are predatory in their attraction to her) are vivid and unsettling, I would like to have learned more about how she came to feel safe with a man again and to love.<br /><br />Her roaming around Nebraska in the last part of the book tends to be a catalogue of places seen without getting much beneath the surface of them. There's a little history, some talk of the impact of corn and cattle on the environment, and many references to the depletion of the great underground reservoir, the Ogallala Aquifer. But balanced against these larger issues, a reader may want for accounts of experiences that pierce through the abstractions to the living human drama they embrace.<br /><br />I recommend this book for readers who like stories of personal journeys and recovery, especially as lived in remote and isolated places.

Poet (and now Poet Laureate) Ted Kooser wrote this collection of prose pieces while in his early sixties, all of them appreciations of his daily life and memories of family going back to his boyhood in Ames, Iowa. Living today in a farmhouse near little Gardner, Nebraska, not far from Lincoln, he first describes the rolling terrain of the land and its Czech and Bohemian settlers, whose descendants continue to provide a cultural identity to the region. The essays are sprinkled with Czech and Bohemian proverbs, reflecting the wry common-sense wisdom of the Old World that informs his point of view.<br /><br />Not all of them essays, some are short prose poems, spun out usually in one or two long sentences that reach a breathless climax that is, well, breathtaking. Reading his work, you are struck by his sincerity and the intensity of his awareness. While a man of strong opinions, they are rarely expressed directly and only seldom ironically, as when he describes the willful spraying of herbicides in road ditches by two county workers who have no sense of the risks to their health and the environment.<br /><br />Identified on the book jacket as a retired insurance executive, Kooser embodies a kind of risk aversion that celebrates what is steady, dependable, and unthreatening in his world. There are rarely shadows, and when they do appear it is with a surprise that is shocking, as when a woman tells of an elderly aunt whose family was murdered by a farm hand when she was a teenager. Even his bout with cancer is told with a kind of emotional reserve and matter-of-factness that belies the anxiety he experienced over a six-month period of recovery.<br /><br />Kooser is clearly abreast of the modern world, but everywhere in his writing, there's a lightness of touch - a gentleness - that harks back to a quieter time in our social history. His touching memories of his father are a tender evocation of post-war America that would easily stand beside illustrations by Normal Rockwell. E. B. White's wonderful essays on rural living in \\"One Man's Meat\\" also come to mind. Like White's, his vision is informed by humor, but rarely at the expense of other people (unless you take exception to his characterization of Republicans as \\"smug\\"). Even pheasant and coyote hunters with their arsenals and SUVs are seen as earnest and only incidentally comical.<br /><br />Thanks to the University of Nebraska Press for bringing this fine book to print.

Unlike most of what passes for literature today, \\"Elizabeth Costello\\" is in a class by itself. For the most part, it is a rhetorical novel, structured as a series of lectures and debates that make up what in academic circles would be called discourse - on a number of topics ranging from postcolonial literature to animal rights to salvation, evil, and sexuality. These are woven into a number of themes including celebrity, ageing, gender, and travel. The characters are strongly drawn and the novel is thick with literary devices that make reading it richly rewarding for the reader who enjoys irony, allusions to other works of literature, the interplay of fictional and nonfictional, and experiments in postmodern storytelling.<br /><br />What the novel does not have (and the negative reviews here reflect this) is a strong plot line. There is dramatic conflict, all right, but it has more to do with collisions between people with strongly held ideas. As the novel progresses, it also concerns deepening inner conflicts as the main character's self-confidence slowly erodes until at the end she is no longer sure of what she believes. But a story with a beginning, middle and end in the traditional sense this is not, and for readers who like being drawn on by a well-crafted plot, this book will be a disappointment. Neither does the book have sympathetic characters to identify with; all of them are likely to set your teeth on edge.<br /><br />Though the events in the novel are more or less chronological - except for the occasional flashback - the novel is not linear in the way that one thing follows necessarily from another. When I got to the end (fully surprised by the last sections), I found myself retracing my steps, looking for connections I had missed along the way. And thinking about the book in its totality, I began to see it as a kind of Rubik's Cube, capable of being seen from many points of view and assembled and reassembled into many different patterns. In that regard, a reader could easily start over from page 1 and discover a whole new novel.<br /><br />I recommend this book to readers who like an intellectual challenge and are willing to forego plot and easily likable characters. It is full of rewards for those who like to entertain unconventional ideas.ard, a reader could easily start over from page 1 and discover a whole new novel.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to readers who like an intellectual challenge and are willing to forego plot and easily likable characters.

Carver can break your heart without seeming to try, and there is that quality in many of these poems. Written in the mid 1980s, in the last years before his death, they are that mix of bittersweet memory, melancholy, and joy taken in the here and now. Living with poet Tess Gallagher in a house overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Washington (Carver grew up in Yakima, Washington), he writes of the days that pass there, the frequent rains and the boats passing on the water, and he tracks the course of fleeting emotions, often triggered by long-forgotten memories.<br /><br />He has this ability to discover the extraordinary in the absolute ordinary, and he can bring together ideas with images drawn from everyday life that disturb and shock the heart, as when he recalls an old relationship while describing the drops and smears of blood left in a kitchen sink after gutting fish. As with his stories, these poems are written in plain, conversational language while evoking at the same time the darkly inexpressible. Simple and direct on the surface, they are like being in a small boat on deep waters.	2005-06-11

This was Raymond Carver's 11th and apparently last book of poems, published after his death by his wife Tess Gallagher, who writes a long, thoughtful introduction describing Carver's last months before dying of cancer at age 50. Unlike his previous collection, \\"Where Water Comes Together With Other Water,\\" this book has a number of poems that are more dream-like and surreal, the references not always easy to grasp. There are story poems that resemble the characters and situations in his short stories. And there are brief selections from the writings and poems of Anton Chekhov, Czeslaw Milosz, and others, which provide an allusive context of ideas and images for Carver's own poems.<br /><br />There is the usual melancholy and awareness of death in these poems, made more riveting by the knowledge of the poet's awareness of his own approaching death. Reading his words and apprehending the emotions they convey, you find yourself treasuring deeply your own living moments - all of them, ordinary or extraordinary as they may be.<br /><br />The poems are variations on related themes, ideas and observations captured and rendered in a wide variety of moods. There is sad bitterness in a poem about his son, \\"On an Old Photograph Of My Son.\\" There are memories of boyhood in Yakima and a memoir-like fragment in \\"Some Prose on 'Poetry',\\" describing a stranger's gift of poetry books to him at an impressionable age. \\"His Bathrobe Pockets Stuffed With Notes\\" is a playful catalog of random thoughts entertained and then dismissed as \\"horsing around.\\" Another poem, rich with evocative detail, illustrates the creative process, \\"The Painter & the Fish.\\" There are love poems, a sadly humorous poem about his toes, and a poem about the excesses of Alexander the Great.<br /><br />It's a fine book, a great reminder of things that really matter - of living the dwindling days wholeheartedly.	2005-06-10

British historian David Hamilton Murdoch argues in this highly readable and informative book that American ideas about the West evolved abruptly around the turn of the last century when perceived social and economic ills threatened Americans' core values and beliefs about themselves. An essential belief, that America's strength and integrity resided in individual freedom and self-reliance, was being put to the test by economic and social realities at the same time the western frontier was declared closed.<br /><br />In a burst of nostalgia for the recent past, a myth of the West was born that transformed historical fact into an idealized portrayal of national character not unlike the emergence of Arthurian legend in the Middle Ages. Spread rapidly by mass media (newspapers, dime novels, wild west shows, movies) the myth became a guiding vision of national purpose and identity for the rest of the century (continuing into the 21st with a ranch-owning Texas president in the White House and a foreign policy set to subdue opposition to American-style personal and economic freedoms).<br /><br />This short book compresses a wealth of research into a fascinating study that accounts for the emergence of the cowboy as a heroic figure - first through the enterprise of William (Buffalo Bill) Cody and then through the efforts of artist Frederick Remington, author Owen Wister (\\"The Virginian\\"), and presidential hopeful Theodore Roosevelt. In the first decade of the 20th century, their portrayal of the cowboy elevated him from the shoot-em-up adventure stories of the wild west shows and dime novels into the embodiment of revered American values - self-reliance, strength, courage, freedom, equality, and the pursuit of justice.<br /><br />Recommended to readers interested in the American West, American history and especially the significance of the cowboy, the book offers a fascinating insight into American culture and politics.	2005-06-05

A colleague got me reading novels again after a long period by recommending \\"The Hunters.\\" Not long afterward, I was reading \\"Solo Faces,\\" stunned in both cases by Salter's crystal clear prose and the wrestling with themes of personal integrity. It has taken me a while to get round to his memoir \\"Burning the Days,\\" which I found myself gulping down in two days and one long night of a holiday weekend. It has been a revelation.<br /><br />Salter's novels are case studies of what I'd call male mythology. The heroes of \\"Hunters\\" and \\"Solo Faces\\" seem trapped in hyper gender roles, testing always both a kind of grace under pressure and an ability to endure physical and psychological extremes. \\"Burning the Days\\" turns out to be a celebration of those values, where to be a man is to embark on a long, lonely journey of proving that one is both like and better than other men.<br /><br />The book is his own story of emerging from a fairly nondescript youth in New York to the life-transforming experience of West Point and a career as a pilot, along with the getting of a kind of worldly wisdom during times spent in Europe, especially Paris. His life as a writer introduces him to literary circles in New York and abroad and an international community of filmmakers and film stars.<br /><br />Through it all, Salter focuses often on the men around him who earn his respect. He marvels at the particular integrity that makes each of them admirable. He elevates each of them into a kind of pantheon, and when all is said and done, he hopes that his own life warrants him a place among them. By contrast, the women who pass through his life are remarked upon for their beauty and intelligence, but beyond that they are walk-ons in this book about men. Readers may be taken by his old-fashioned glamorizing of women, or they may take exception to it.<br /><br />Brilliantly written, the book is compelling for what it sets out to do - provide a remembrance of things past that not only captures moments and people in vivid detail but bathes them in a melancholy glow - like richly detailed sepia photographs.tures moments and people in vivid detail but bathes them in a melancholy glow - like richly detailed sepia photographs.	2005-06-01

Lovers of western swing owe a debt of gratitude to musicologist Charles Townsend, who spent many years collecting material for this wonderful biography of Bob Wills. In addition to many interviews with Bob and Betty Wills in the years (1971-73) before his death, Townsend talked at length to scores of people who worked with Wills and remembered him.<br /><br />The great achievement of the book is its warm appreciation of Wills and his Texas Playboys and its evocation of a swath of 20th century social history, while standing also as a sound work of research. Each chapter is followed by pages of footnotes that cite his sources; there are 200+ photographs of Bob and the many bands, right up to the final reunion; and the book ends with a 30+ page discography, with details of every recording session from 1929-1973. The 19-page index also makes it an excellent reference book.<br /><br />Townsend argues that Wills created a unique form of popular music by mixing instruments associated with both country music and jazz - strings on the one hand and drums, brass, and reeds on the other. He notes how Wills' distinctive style was a blend of frontier fiddle music, New Orleans Dixieland, and blues learned as a boy picking cotton with black field laborers. Not exactly country, and certainly not hillbilly - though he was often identified as such by recording marketers who seemed seldom to understand him - Wills often emulated the big swing bands of the 1930s and 40s. So his music acquired the label \\"western swing,\\" and its popularity went from regional to national. Finally, with his best-loved hit \\"New San Antonio Rose\\" (1940) he entered the mainstream of American popular music.<br /><br />While following the rise of Wills' career as a bandleader, Townsend focuses also on his personal problems, his many marriages, his financial difficulties, his insecurities, and his alcoholism. Also, the post-war years were never to match the satisfaction Wills had in his first band. But even while popular music evolved and left swing behind, Wills maintained a huge audience of devoted fans, and younger bands today (Asleep at the Wheel, Hot Club of Cowtown) continue the legacy. This book is for everybody whose love affair with Bob Wills and his music lives on.while popular music evolved and left swing behind, Wills maintained a huge audience of devoted fans, and younger bands today (Asleep at the Wheel, Hot Club of Cowtown) continue the legacy.

This is a five-star book for readers who enjoy fish-out-of-water accounts of travel, where the writer's eye (ear, nose and throat, for that matter) seems to encounter only the completely incongruous and absurd. The jokes go both ways, of course - on the inhabitants of the place traveled through as well as the credulous author, whose expectations are wildly different. Paul Theroux does this in (to me) a cranky and irritating way (\\"Kingdom by the Sea\\"), but Duncan McLean, a Scotsman from little Orkney, plays it for belly laughs, and there's a lot of fun to be had along the way.<br /><br />A caveat or two. Texans may find his jaundiced view of Texas grating, and lovers of Bob Wills and western swing may find the book something of a hodgepodge on those two subjects. Onion festivals, scary encounters with border patrol, and his opinion of Rush Limbaugh will seem beside the point. Likewise, readers not into western swing will find his enthusiasms, knowledge of music trivia, and references to musicians and songs a bit of a yawn.<br /><br />But if you've read Charles Townsend's biography of Bob Wills and love the music, this slaphappy mix of travel writing and musicology can put a big smile on your face. Also, McLean's difficulties in finding and interviewing the old-timers who once played with Wills will give you an appreciation for the monumental effort of research that went into the writing of the biography. Best advice: Read Townsend first, then pick up McLean and be prepared to laugh.	2005-05-31

This wonderful collection of autobiographical essays and short fiction (not always easy to tell apart) will please any real-cowboy fan, and certainly any Will James fan. In his easy-going cowboy-talk vernacular, James tells it like it is (or in many cases, was), patiently explaining the ins and outs of cowboy life while giving the good parts a bit of a romantic glow and all the rest his dry, even-tempered humor.<br /><br />Writing in the 1930s, fifty years after the cattle drives and open range, James argues that there's still plenty of wide open spaces for old-time cowboying, and while he is aware of the encroachments of 20th century mechanization, he makes a strong case for the old ways, the central role of horses in the cowboy's identity, and the enduring qualities of the cowboy code. The contents of the book are evenly balanced among those three themes.<br /><br />Like he is writing for city-born novices, he patiently explains the many uses of the cowboy's gear: hat, chaps, boots, rope, slicker, and so on. I'm familiar with these subjects, but still I had never read before such a detailed accounting of the makeup and contents of the cowboy's bedroll (gatherings). I've also never read such a careful description of how to eat a meal sitting cross-legged on the ground.<br /><br />There are many stories of horses of all kinds, especially the broncs that were hardest to break. At least a couple of them lay up the author with broken bones. There's a chapter devoted to cattle (\\"The Critter\\") and another about trekking with a small herd through a fierce winter blizzard (\\"On the Drift\\"). Another chapter gives a month-by-month description of the cowboy's year. James devotes another chapter to the rodeo, at a time before rodeo cowboys were organized into a professional organization that would protect their interests.<br /><br />Writing fiction, James could go for the heartstrings, as in the sentimental story of brother horses, \\"Tom and Jerry,\\" and the melodramatic account of a young outlaw who mends his ways, \\"Scattered Tracks.\\" And the entire book is illustrated with James' wonderful illustrations of cowboys, horses, and cattle.

Writing biography is hard work, says the author of this book, John Erickson, who's written fine books about his own cowboying and ranching experiences, as well as a series of hilarious children's books \\"Hank the Cowdog.\\" In this book, he lets his subject Frankie McWhorter talk in his own voice, and what we get is a transcription of more or less free-association anecdotes from the Texas cowboy fiddler who once played in Bob Wills' famous western swing band.<br /><br />The result is rough around the edges and freewheeling in a kind of one-darn-thing-after-another way. And it captures maybe as well as you can in the printed word the cowboy culture of Panhandle Texas - its values, preoccupations, and down-to-earth points of view. What you miss, of course, are the visual and oral dimensions of this kind of storytelling. And because McWhorter was a fiddler who counted himself among Bob Wills' most trusted band members, you also yearn to hear the music that he's talking about.<br /><br />Laboring a bit under these disadvantages, the book is a worthy introduction to a colorful and talented cowboy who has never lost his roots in the soil of Hall County, Texas. There are 35+ great black and white photos of McWhorter as both fiddler and cowboy. But to get to know the full dimension of the man, the best thing is to go directly to the music section of amazon and order yourself a McWhorter CD.<br /><br />Meanwhile, readers hoping to know more about the career of Bob Wills will find that McWhorter came along after the peak of Wills' success. The big band leader is beginning to age here, and not gracefully, relying over much on the bottle to get him through the days on the road. There are, however, some entertaining and informative Wills stories, including examples of the firm hand he took with band members and an explanation of how the classic \\"San Antonio Rose\\" began as a \\"mistake\\" and then, thanks to Irving Berlin, needed to be rechristened \\"New San Antonio Rose.\\"	2005-05-19

This is a solid 5-star book for any reader interested in the day-to-day, season-by-season work of cowboying and running a ranch. The author describes in this well-written book his four years (1974-78) of single-handedly managing a cow-calf operation on 5000 acres of sandy grassland in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The writing is precise and informative, full of love for the life he has chosen, admiration for the hard-working men who are his friends and neighbors, and a deepening understanding of the ranch's four not-always-cooperative horses.<br /><br />There's also a good deal of humor in the book, much of it owing to the particularly unmanageable nature of the cattle on the ranch. An episode of fruitlessly chasing two wild cows through a series of pasture fences made it into a collection of cowboy humor called \\"Horsing Around,\\" by Lawrence Clayton and Kenneth Davis. We also read how the author gets a reputation for picking the worst weather for fall roundups. The book ends on a soberer note, as Erickson is told that the ranch is being sold and that he's out of a job. While he's happy enough to clear the ranch of the hateful cattle that have tried his patience, there's a bittersweetness as he parts with the horses that we've come to know so well.<br /><br />This is the first, and maybe best, of a series of books by the author about his ranching experiences. It was followed by \\"Cowboy Country\\" and \\"LZ Cowboy.\\" As in the others, the text of this book is illustrated with a number of nicely selected black and white photographs. Larry McMurtry has some interesting words to say about cowboys by way of introduction (he's usually not so appreciative).

This short book is an account of a year and a half (1978-1979) in the Oklahoma Panhandle, where the author cowboyed for an extended family of ranchers, the Barbys. Well written, with a fine appreciation for the men he worked with, it describes in informative and entertaining detail the day-to-day work of cowboys through the round of several seasons. Erickson might well have called his book \\"The Secret Life of Cowboys\\" for it reveals much of how they think and feel.<br /><br />There is the admiration that the younger cowboys feel for the older, more accomplished men and the fear of making a fool of themselves by not performing up to standard. By contrast, we also see the prankster side of these men, as they tease each other and play practical jokes, countering the trials and difficulties of work with a well-developed sense of humor.<br /><br />The book has 35+ black and white photographs taken by the author's wife, Kristine Erickson. An excellent addition to any cowboy bookshelf. Erickson's story continues in his book \\"LZ Cowboy,\\" also recommended.	2005-05-16

Among the many cowboy memoirs, this is another good one. Seems like every old-time cowboy remembers it in a different way, and thus our picture of that time takes on new depth. Cowboying in Wyoming in the 1880s, Reuben Mullins was an almost exact contemporary of Owen Wister (\\"The Virginian\\"). Each saw the rawness of life in the frontier towns, loved the beauty of the open ranges, enjoyed the company of working men and admired those whose courage, stoicism and valor made them top hands. Like Wister, Mullins subscribed to the he-man mystique celebrated by Theodore Roosevelt. Both men were also disturbed by the prevalence of mob violence and lynching on the frontier.<br /><br />Each lamented the passing of the Old West, and while Wister returned East to become famous as a writer, Mullins went to med school and practiced medicine in Nebraska, first as a doctor and then as a dentist. He didn't write his memoir of cowboying until the 1920s, when he was in his 60s. He died in 1935, his memoir unpublished. It wasn't discovered until the 1980s and was published then by western scholars.<br /><br />In his short career as a young cowboy, Mullins was known first as a blacksmith, a skill he had learned in Iowa before going out West. He also supplemented his income with coal mining during the winter months. For a time he ran a goods store in Douglas, Wyoming. Neither a drinker nor gambler, he saved his money and counted among his friends future bankers, senators, and governors. He regarded cowboying as an irresistible \\"addiction\\" even while his memories are often of being unhappy - the weather being too wet, too hot or cold, the days too long, the down time dispiriting, the foreman too seldom granting him the appreciation Mullins felt he deserved.<br /><br />A reader will find the usual accounts of roundups, cattle drives, good and bad horses, accidents, the cook's food, and pranks played on greenhorns. Interesting are descriptions of bunkhouse pastimes, including boxing, foot races, and games. There's also a curious exchange of letters with women back East interested in marrying a cowboy. (On a return trip to Iowa, Mullins actually looks up the girl he's written to.) We witness the impact of a respectable woman's presence at the ranch; Mullins also reports a sighting of Calamity Jane, sleeping off what he assumes to be a drunk.<br /><br />The book includes five period photographs, two of them of the author. It's an excellent companion to Teddy Blue Abbott's \\"We Pointed Them North\\" and Ike Blasingame's \\"Dakota Cowboy.\\"oot races, and games.

This is a 5-star book for anyone interested in the day-to-day of cowboying on a modern ranch. Writer John Erickson (best known for his humorous not-just-for-children's series \\"Hank the Cowdog\\") spent two years as a hand on the Ellzey spread in the north Texas Panhandle in 1979-1981 and kept this journal of his working days there. The entries give accounts of moving cattle between pastures, doctoring for pink eye and bloat, roundups, winter feeding, calving and putting out prairie fires - all outdoor work in weather that is too often wet, bitterly cold, or fiercely hot.<br /><br />The cowboy interest in roping and horses gets extensive treatment. The author and has friend Tom Ellzey often work together, and the measure of their days is often taken in tallies of successful and unsuccessful attempts to rope usually uncooperative cattle. We also get to know their horses - Calipso, Happy, Casey, Popeye, Deuce - and the peculiar personality of each. After a season of practice together, the two men enter a rangeland team-roping contest, where they hope to find out how good they really are.<br /><br />What comes across most strongly in the book is the physically punishing work of cowboying. Both men sustain injuries and have some near-fatal on-the-job accidents. In one instance, the author's frightened horse gets her rider and herself tangled in electric fence wire. Meanwhile, the ranch teeters at the edge of financial failure as cattle prices drop and interest rates soar up to 20%. (In one brief reminder of the world beyond the ranch, Erickson makes note of the American hostages in Iran.)<br /><br />Not originally written for publication, the book stands up well as a description of real cowboying. It's a rare day when the weather is tolerable and things go smoothly. A reader can wonder why anyone does this work at all, let alone account for the romantic hold it has on the imagination of people who get no closer to cattle than the hamburger they order in the drive-thru. But the pride taken in work done well and difficulties overcome - plus the satisfaction of a well-thrown rope - seems to make up for the rest. This book demonstrates that well. There are also numerous photographs by the author's wife Kris.<br /><br />Other recommended reading: Linda Hasselstrom's day-by-day journal of ranching in South Dakota, \\"Windbreak\\" and Montana rancher Dan Aadland's \\"Sketches of the Ranch.\\"ru.

These are Owen Wister's first western stories, written for Harpers Monthly in 1894-95, and published together under the title \\"Red Men and White\\" in 1896. Lovers of his novel \\"The Virginian\\" will recognize some of his themes in this collection and an early version of The Virginian himself in the character of Specimen Jones, who appears in three of the stories, first as a drifter and prospector, then as a soldier in the U.S. Army.<br /><br />The Easterner who narrates much of \\"The Virginian\\" appears here, too, in a long story that takes him on a journey across Arizona in the rough, disreputable days before statehood. Wister's concern for the American character, which he finds much eroded among civilians in the West, crops up in this story, \\"A Pilgrim on the Gila.\\" By contrast, we see his sympathy for young men on the wrong side of the law, only after it has been first lampooned in the satiric \\"The Serenade at Siskiyou,\\" where the genteel ladies of the town attempt to lighten the hearts of two prisoners held for murder.<br /><br />That story also explores the tensions between men and women in a frontier world where gender roles are rigidly different. This and one other story concern themselves with the occurrence of lynching alleged lawbreakers. Both of these themes emerge again dramatically in \\"The Virginian.\\"<br /><br />Many stories reflect Wister's respect for the disciplined men of the American Army on the frontier. Meanwhile, Indians figure in two stories: \\"Little Big Horn Medicine\\" and \\"The General's Bluff.\\" The title story, \\"Salvation Gap,\\" is a mining camp melodrama, involving the murder of a woman and the hanging of her lover. \\"La Tinaja Bonita\\" is a long story in a similar vein, involving a man's long journey across an arid Arizona desert, driven by jealous love and ending in death. Finally, \\"The Second Missouri Compromise\\" tells a humorous story of unreconstructed Southern politicians at odds with the Territorial Governor and his Treasurer, both northerners, in Boise, Idaho.<br /><br />Wister was already a good storyteller in these early pieces, capturing in vivid detail the western terrain and the mostly squalid life of frontier towns and mining camps. While fascinated by the West, he does not romanticize it. He observes the excesses of unbridled independence there, while lamenting the absence of good sense and ethics among Easterners, especially politicians in Washington. He sees glimpses of character in a few men, mostly in uniform, and they will come together finally in the shining example of The Virginian some half dozen years later.therners, in Boise, Idaho. <br /> <br />Wister was already a good storyteller in these early pieces, capturing in vivid detail the western terrain and the mostly squalid life of frontier towns and mining camps.

In this wonderful oversize book are 127 stunning photographs of Great Basin buckaroos and ranches, in color and black and white. The images are sharply focused and the reproduction is vivid. Many photographs capture the terrain, whether dead flat under a vast open sky or mountainous. A lone figure on a horse may appear as a small detail in the picture, or men working cattle in various seasons may be the subject. Markus also turns his camera to individuals for portrait shots. And he captures close-up details of cowboy gear, tack, and clothing.<br /><br />At times, the breath-taking western vistas approach the character of (very good) calendar art. More often than not, however, Markus has an eye for the everyday and the wonder to be felt in ordinary passing moments. The golden light of a low sun reflects from the watery slurry in a corral onto the boards of a fence; a ranch interior shows a kitchen table with worn chairs and oil cloth in the foreground and in the next room a workshop with tools neatly arranged on the walls; a couple dances in a cowboy bar; two young cowboys have roped and tied a third one, who is getting head-dunked into a stream; in the retreating light from a clear evening sky, a cowboy steps from a tent and in the foreground, under a windmill, is a portable radio with its antenna extended.<br /><br />Interesting for those more familiar with cowboys from east of the Rockies, the book shows the many details of outfitting that mark the buckaroo as distinctly different - suspenders, flat brimmed hats, large scarves, chinks, vests. There are also beards and some fancy mustaches. The book opens with several pages of enjoyable excerpts from the photographer's journals. There's additional informative commentary for many of the photographs at the back of the book. Excellent addition to any western bookshelf.	2005-04-27

I loved \\"Shipping News\\" for its mix of quirky characters, dark humor, sentiment, sheer scariness, and the impact of an isolated and starkly beautiful landscape. Much of this shows up again in her short stories set in Wyoming, where isolation and economic contingencies tend to get a strangle hold on the people who live there. The tough survive OK, but only by fierce determination and good luck, of which there is scarcely enough to go around.<br /><br />The stories range from brief comic interludes, existing sometimes chiefly for the sake of a punch line (\\"The Old Badger Game\\" and \\"Summer of the Hot Tubs\\"), to humorous yarns about colorful local characters (\\"The Trickle Down Effect\\"), to longer accounts of people up against unwelcome circumstances with every potential of crushing them. The marriage of a retired New York couple in a massive log house on a ranchette starts to crumble under the pressure of a Wyoming winter (\\"Man Crawling Out of Trees\\"). A 4th-generation rancher is squeezed into a desperate corner by rising costs, falling prices, coalbed methane drilling, and a disintegrated family (\\"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?\\").<br /><br />A hundred years of Wyoming history are compressed into a story about the fortunes of a wealthy polo-playing family, the empty shell of which is invaded by descendants of the massacred at Wounded Knee (\\"The Indian Wars Refought\\"). And finally, in my favorite story of the bunch, a young man trying to pull his life back together finds himself in a nightmarish situation involving a violent neighbor (\\"The Wamsutter Wolf\\"). This one had me sitting up past my bedtime, wide-eyed in the night and heart pounding.<br /><br />The tone of the stories varies with the publication they were written for, and these range from The New Yorker to the literary quarterlies, to Playboy. Once you get over that, you can settle back and just let Proulx pull out whatever stops she cares to, to create one heck of a read - and one right after another.<br /><br />Readers who enjoy her broadly humorous Elk Tooth stories will enjoy Robert Welsch's comic collection, \\"It's Not the End of the Earth, But You Can See It From Here,\\" set in fictional Centralia, Nebraska.d - and one right after another.  <br /> <br />Readers who enjoy her broadly humorous Elk Tooth stories will enjoy Robert Welsch's comic collection, \\"It's Not the End of the Earth, But You Can See It From Here,\\" set in fictional Centralia, Nebraska.	2005-04-19

This entertaining book is a gallery of caricature portraits, representing the many men who over the years have worked at the fictional Lazy Daisy Ranch. Together, they are a range of mostly comical character types, with names like Moose Johnson, Bubbles Larson, and Eb Dingle (who might easily have walked out of an Annie Proulx short story). Artist Duane Bryers has a wonderful time capturing these men - all 27 of them - unshaven, needing haircuts, smoking roll-your-owns, and wearing beat-up cowboy hats.<br /><br />Writer Dee Ray provides a brief character sketch for each one, told in bunkhouse vernacular. There's also an amusing essay (as told by \\"Mule Scruggs\\"), with more illustrations describing the mostly unsavory ambiance of the bunkhouse itself and the details of a day-in-the-life around the ranch, with reference to the cook's meals and details of cowboy pastimes at day's end. A book to be enjoyed by any cowboy fan.	2005-04-18

Ernest \\"Ike\\" Blasingame was barely twenty when he went from Texas to South Dakota in 1904 to cowboy for the Matador Land and Cattle Company on rangeland leased from the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. His account of that experience covers the next 7-8 years, and it's a well-told story full of memorable incidents, cowmen, and horses. There's an excellent balance between informative explanations of the work of cowboys on the ranges and amusing anecdotes, accounts of mishaps and accidents, and nicely drawn descriptions of personalities and behavior revealing depth of character (or lack of it) among his colleagues.<br /><br />The roll of the seasons and the extremes of weather are well described, including the fatal winter of 1906-07. Indians also figure prominently in the narrative, and you can get a good understanding of the cattle industry itself in the years before the West was transformed by homesteading settlers and small farmers. Demon rum has a role to play in the fortunes and misadventures of these men, and there are insights into the social history of the all-male, bachelor work force who performed the hard labor of working cattle.<br /><br />Remembered and told 50 years later (the book was first published in 1958), Blasingame tells his story as though it happened yesterday. It is full of youthful enthusiasm and wide-eyed enjoyment of his work and his growing reputation as a fine young bronc rider, taming the company's unbroken horses and winning the respect of the men he works for, who quickly trust him to rep for the Matador at roundups on other ranges.<br /><br />It's not clear how much of the writing is really Blasingame's. He gives credit to his wife \\"who wrote this while I talked.\\" And it may well be she to whom we owe the credit for this lucid, well-organized, vividly described memoir. At any rate, as a joint project, it provides a wealth of information and entertainment for anyone interested in the real West of working cowboys. It's a classic.

There's no shortage of rodeo photography books, but this is one of the better ones. Rather than concentrating on the arena events themselves, photographer Rosamond Norbury captures much of the ambiance of rodeo in these candid shots of cowboys, their families, and the organization of people behind the rodeo, including medics, bullfighters (or clowns), judges, pick-up men, the stock contractor, announcers, and rodeo secretaries. In 100 or so black and white photos Norbury gives us a broad picture gallery of all kinds of people, old and young, gathering for a weekend of excitement, entertainment, fun, and for those who are religious, an opportunity for Sunday morning worship.<br /><br />Some favorite shots in this collection: Saturday night dancers, a rodeo rider napping on a wooden platform with his hat over his eyes, a cowboy changing from sneakers into boots, a cowboy in a pickup truck cab talking on a mobile phone, two more cowboys on pay phones, a teenage cowgirl with a Miss British Columbia sash and a mouthful of braces, three cowboys with their gear heading across a wet runway to a waiting small plane, a cowboy camped out on a couch under a sleeping bag, his jeans lying in a tangle on the floor beside him.<br /><br />An informative commentary describing both the rodeo events themselves and all the behind-the-scenes activity runs through the book along with the pictures. The photos have ample captions. There's even a cowboy prayer, with its spiritual references expressed in the language and metaphor of the rodeo. Handsomely designed, this book is an excellent addition to any Western bookshelf.	2005-04-11

There's a growing literature of memoirs written by women who grew up on ranches, and this is a fine addition to it. Jordan tells of her family, who for four generations raised cattle in southeast Wyoming, north of Laramie and Cheyenne. With some irony, it was more circumstance than a love of ranching that kept the Jordans on the land, until the author's father sold the home place in the 1970s. But the love of that spot on earth lives on strongly in the author, and her book is a tribute to it and to her family who toiled there through good years and bad.<br /><br />She clearly admires the men who labored on horseback raising cattle, devoting chapters to her grandfather, her father, and the many foremen and ranch hands who worked for them. Fully engaging, too, are her memories of the women and the imprint they have made on herself. Three portraits in particular stand out: her mother, Jo, with a warm, generous, and independent spirit, who died suddenly at an early age; her great aunt Marie, who loved her horses and dogs like the children she never had, and lived happily together with her husband and her husband's best friend; and finally her grandmother Effie, a puzzlingly bitter woman whose wishes for a full life seem to have been frustrated from girlhood because of her gender and social limitations.<br /><br />There's much in this book to commend it, including a chapter devoted to the calving season and another describing the physically punishing nature of ranch work. Her chapter on her great aunt Marie includes excerpts from her journals, and each chapter is introduced with a photograph from the family album. The book closes with a description of the author's wedding at the community center near where she grew up, an idyllic day poignant for its wholehearted celebration of a way of community life that is rapidly vanishing.<br /><br />I recommend this book to readers interested in the West, ranching, family memoirs, and personal journeys.

This is a terrific collection of 60+ black and white photographs by rodeo enthusiast Louise Serpa, dating from the 1960s to the 1990s. Most are a privileged view of the action, taken inside the arena, and the drama in those frozen moments of action is electric. As Larry McMurtry points out in his commentary at the end of the book, she has the gift of capturing motion just as a leaping animal and rider are poised in mid-air, ready to be overcome by gravity. Besides roughstock, she also finds the excitement in other events, like steer wrestling, team roping, and barrel racing, as well as the work of the bullfighters, or clowns.<br /><br />One of the most dramatic shots is of a young bareback rider silhouetted against the thickening cloud of a sudden dust storm. In another, a fallen cowboy goes down under a completely air-borne saddle bronc. Another shows a surging melee of cowboys and horses in a wild horse race, while a saxophonist stands to play in the bandstand, and just beyond are boulders and forest-covered Arizona hillsides.<br /><br />The book is organized with a balancing flow of action shots followed by group and individual photos taken behind the chutes of riders stretching, adjusting their rigging, leaning on a fence to watch the show (backsides to the camera), or just sitting around talking. A few portrait shots capture a variety of moods among the contestants. Meanwhile, her own running commentary, describing rodeo events and rodeo people, flows along with the images.<br /><br />By contrast, novelist Larry McMurtry's anti-romantic comments about cowboys and rodeos close the book, but as he observes, it doesn't seem to matter how strongly you challenge the myth. The myth lives on. Hugely enjoyable book. Currently out of print. Find a copy and hang onto it.	2005-04-08

Growing up as Wright Morris did on the plains of Nebraska, I believe one's eye is educated by the vast grid of east-west and north-south roads, the mostly uninterrupted flat landscape, the big sky, and intense light and shadow. I see this in many of his photographs, like \\"House in Winter, near Lincoln, Nebraska 1940\\". Here a weather-beaten, abandoned house stands alone on a slight rise in a snow-covered field under a bright winter sun. The house faces the camera, only one side visible, and in the wall there is one dark, vertical window. A sagging snow fence hugs the edge of the field, and beyond it are the bare branches of a small tree. Above is a hazy scrim of clouds against open sky. The stark simplicity of the picture may strike some as deliberately formalist or minimalist. To the eye of a plainsman, it's familiar and somehow \\"just right.\\"<br /><br />The entire collection of photographs in this book, taken mostly in the 1940s, captures a deep stillness, chiefly because they reflect evidence of human activity (houses, schools, cars, store fronts, grain elevators, interiors of houses), but in nearly all of them people are absent. Even in a barbershop, with a variety of current calendars festooning the walls and plants growing in pots and leaning toward the sunlit windows, there is no one. The chairs are empty.<br /><br />It's easy to oversimplify the intent of these photographs, as Alan Trachtenberg and Ralph Lieberman argue in their essays included in this book. For me, they represent a way of seeing that looks for balance and rest, while acknowledging at the same time that everything must change. The tension between those two things is captured ironically in the last photo, \\"Juke Box, Southern Indiana 1950,\\" in which a glorious, 1930s-style, lighted juke box stands against a wall under two framed pictures, what looks like a ceramic flying fish, and in the upper left corner a sign reading, \\"No Dancing.\\"<br /><br />This book of 80 beautifully reproduced black and white photographs includes a chronology of Wright Morris' career as writer and photographer (1910-1998) and a bibliography of books by and about him.

The 90 black and white photographs collected in this book were taken by Ray Rector, who cowboyed as a young man in the first decade of the 20th century and then became a photographer, working out of Stamford, Texas. With his hand-held Kodak he was a recorder of life in the Panhandle, visiting many ranches to capture images of the working life of cowboys.<br /><br />These are mostly candid shots of men at work. All have captions, which often identify the men in the pictures and the ranch where they were photographed. A couple of standouts include photos of a cowboy called \\"Six\\" who poses with his rigging in one and demonstrates a rope trick in another. Chuck wagon cooks are also featured.<br /><br />Photographs date into the 1930s and are organized into the stages of the workday - from the morning remuda to branding calves in a roundup and mid-day dinner around the chuck wagon. A few pictures chronicle the visits of women to the cow camps, where pastimes include square dancing in the open air. The collection concludes with photographs of Stamford at the turn of the century and the first gatherings of cowboy reunions organized by Rector in the 1930s to commemorate the old days.<br /><br />The book includes an entertaining essay about cowboy myth vs. reality by Texas writer John Graves. Excellent addition to any library of early Western social history.	2005-04-06

This book is a collection of 110 color photographs that capture the drama, tension, and excitement of the most dangerous rodeo events - bareback, saddle bronc, and bull riding. Working out of his home base in Tucson, Arizona, photographer John Annerino has taken his camera behind the chutes, where he gets about as close as any observer can to the experience of riding roughstock.<br /><br />This is a handsomely designed book, and the photographs are vividly reproduced, the images richly detailed, crisp and clear, often filling the pages. In a two-page spread, a cowboy flies to the ground from a bucking bull, while bull fighters in their clown costumes circle the animal, late afternoon sun casting long shadows and illuminating a cloud of dust kicked up around them. The gravel-strewn arena dirt is rough with the hoof marks of countless rides, and beyond a fence festooned with lite beer pennants, the stands are filled with hundreds of spectators, every face turned toward the action.<br /><br />Annerino's camera reveals that in addition to the stereotypical cowboy, roughstock riders include Native Americans, African Americans, and women as well. And he writes a long essay at the beginning of the book tracing the arrival of the horse and horsemen at the start of the Spanish Conquest, the growth of the cattle industry and the evolution over centuries of the vaquero and in more recent times the emergence of the American cowboy. This is a fine book whose visual images offer an enthusiastic appreciation of the men and women who risk life and limb in rodeo's toughest events.	2005-04-04

There's a brief introduction by cowboy actor Harry Carey, Jr., and cowboy poet and humorist Baxter Black also makes an appearance, with a photo and a poem, \\"Cowboy Heaven.\\" The book is well designed, with two-page spreads balancing pages with clusters of smaller photographs. A few pages include anecdotes as told by cowboys. Great coffee table book.	2005-04-04

This fine collection of 90+ sepia-tinted photographs was taken in the years 1970-1973 by American photographer Bill Wittliff on a ranch in northern Mexico where the vaquero traditions inherited by American cowboys still survived almost unchanged by the 20th century. Most of the photographs show the vaqueros working cattle and horses. Some show them around the morning campfire, their bedrolls still spread out on the stony ground. A few show them in the bunkhouse at the ranch. The most striking of the images are portrait shots of the vaqueros themselves, looking with smiles into the camera.<br /><br />The book is introduced by Texas writer John Graves, who describes is own experiences with vaqueros and travels in ranch country south of the border. Wittliff's recollections of his visits to the big ranch, which was broken up soon after his pictures were taken, are a series of impressions like photo images in a scrapbook. Altogether, the book is a tribute to a time and a traditional life that existed for many generations, but for the most part exists no more. An excellent addition to any bookshelf of Western literature.	2005-04-04
US	51205644	RRXKEAQ0D5BF1	0670033448	9843603	The Inner Circle	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Boyle does it again . . .	One thing for sure, T. C. Boyle is usually up to something. You can't take his stories at face value. Nor do they turn out to be what you expect. Sometimes his narrator just isn't to be trusted, and you have to read between the lines.<br /><br />All of this is true of this novel about the famous author of the Kinsey Reports. If you're expecting something steamy with a behind-the-scenes look at the man and the men who were part of his research team, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting an insightful study of Kinsey himself, something deeper and more substantial than the recent movie, you'll be only partly satisfied. The reason is that Boyle chooses to tell the story through the point of view of an assistant of Kinsey's, who worships the man, even when his behavior is questionable.<br /><br />Boyle's Kinsey is not sympathetic or heroic, but Milk, the narrator, tries to withhold information about him that would portray him in a bad light, rationalizes what he reveals, and seems in denial about the rest. As a result, the book becomes more a study of Milk, a weak man who allows himself to be used and manipulated by Kinsey, while at the same time he is dominated by his young but not unlikable young wife. When he insists in the final pages that love at times must take precedence over animal desire, he arrives at an understanding that any sensible reader would have held from page one of the novel.<br /><br />So the book is an odd and quirky journey, that leaves you with a somewhat jaundiced view of all its characters, especially the great man himself, and you marvel that his work, which contributed to a much needed sexual liberation, could be based on such ethically compromised underpinnings.	2005-03-25

First published in 1975, this book is a celebration of the old time cowboy, as he flourished during the two decades of the cattle drives in the late 19th century. His story is told by Texas journalist Caleb Pirtle, a writer who clearly loves his subject and collects here an account of those years drawn from a wide selection of historical sources, including the writings of Will James, Charlie Siringo, and Charlie Russell. The closing pages fast-forward to the present, with observations about cowboys on modern-day ranches, working on feedlots, and riding rough stock in rodeos.<br /><br />Easy to read, and often amusing as it captures the spirit of old-time cowboys, the text of the book is illuminated by the work of ten Texas cowboy artists (XIT = Ten in Texas) whose paintings and sculptures portray the many roles and lives of the working cowboy. Altogether, there are 89 pictures, some rough and ready and others thoughtful and well rendered, such as Kenneth Wyatt's \\"Lonesome But Free,\\" which captures the fierce independence, quiet confidence, and the reserve of these men.<br /><br />Out of print, but worth finding a copy for any library of cowboy literature.	2005-03-23

Collected here are 100+ watercolors of mostly cowboys and western themes by painter William Matthews. First inspired by readings at the Elko, Nevada, Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1985, Matthews became fascinated by the lives of working cowboys, their manner, attitudes, and spirit. Unlike the more dramatic renderings of Charlie Russell and Frederic Remington, Matthews' cowboys are often quietly at work or caught in moments of contemplation, often astride their horses. His images focus attention on the body language of cowboys, their clothes and hats, and rarely on faces.<br /><br />A number of paintings are beautiful landscapes, rivers, ranch buildings, a rodeo grounds against a sunset-colored outcropping of rock. The book includes a remembrance of cowboys from his family's ranch by writer William Kittredge and an accounting of the buckaroos of the Great Basin. Another essay by Dyan Zaslowsky tells of the career of William Matthews, born in 1949 and growing up in San Francisco. This is a handsomely designed oversize book, and an excellent addition to any bookshelf of Western art and literature.	2005-03-22

While historian John Upton Terrell wrote a great many books about American Indians, this book, The Bunkhouse Papers, is a collection of reminiscences describing his own experiences as a young man in the West during the decades between the two World Wars. Only one of the essays concerns bunkhouses, and it totally deromanticizes that subject, portraying them as a kind of cowboy Animal House.<br /><br />The other essays in the book cover a range of experiences as Terrell works at various laboring occupations across the West and meets men of many different kinds. There is a gentle openness to the world in the memories he records here, a generosity of spirit in stories remembered and told, and a sense of melancholy in recollections of times and people long past. I enjoyed this book a great deal. It is well written, the illustrations by Lorence Bjorkland illuminate the text, and together they bring to life an era that has all but vanished.	2005-03-14

This is almost a one-of-a-kind novel, set in the high plains of western Nebraska, where the North and South Platte Rivers join, a farming community of Lutherans and Catholics, in the mid-1970s. Its two central characters are young men of the Vietnam generation, boyhood friends, one of them now a veteran of the war, injured by friendly fire, the other a draft resister, returning after several years of living in Mexico. They and several friends band together for a summer of playing fiercely competitive softball against teams from neighboring towns, drinking beer, and struggling with varying degrees of success to make the most of lives disoriented by the recent war and an ongoing small-farm crisis.<br /><br />It's rare to read a book that so vividly captures the experience of farm work and the personalities of rural people. Richter writes in detail of getting an old self-propelled combine ready for harvest, disking ground, and overhauling the engine of a truck. And he describes with equal thoroughness the playing of ball games and of the men who make up the team. The extremes of weather on the plains also figure dramatically in the novel - a white-out blizzard, summer thunderstorms, and a window-breaking hail storm.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his characters are strongly drawn, and their speech, attitudes, and mannerisms are articulated authentically. The author has an understanding of how rural people bound in time and space to the land and often-limited circumstances adapt their dreams to the opportunities that are available. He also understands that for some this is not enough. In that respect, the novel has an undertone of loss and sadness, which emerges in a poignant scene involving the sale of a farm. I recommend this well-written novel for anyone with an interest in rural lives, farming, friendships, and stories about coming home.	2005-03-12

This is an entertaining and moving collection of 32 poems by Montana poet Paul Zarzyski, who belongs to that rarified fraternity of rodeo cowboy poets. The intensity and focus required for riding roughstock are transferred into these highly charged poems, and most of them have the headlong intensity of a high-scoring 8-second ride.<br /><br />Some of my favorite Zarzyski poems are included in this collection: \\"Buck,\\" a Christmas-time lament for a dead horse; \\"To Wallace,\\" a tribute to rancher-poet Wallace McRae; \\"Partner,\\" about the fierce and loving bond between two rodeo friends, dedicated to Montana writer, Kim Zupan; \\"Monte Carlo Express - Box 258, 15.3 Miles Home,\\" about reading mail while driving a speeding car; and the high-spirited \\"Escorting Granny to the Potluck Rocky Mountain Oyster Feed at Bowman's Corner.\\" The best, of course, is the title poem, \\"All This Way for the Short Ride,\\" about the death of another rider.<br /><br />There's an appreciative foreword by Wyoming-born western writer, Teresa Jordan, and 27 wonderful black-and-white rodeo photographs by Montana photographer Barbara Van Cleve, taken between the years 1971-1996.

This is a book of cowboy photography, produced by John McQuarrie, who tells us in his introduction that his book is the result of traveling all around New Mexico talking to ranchers and photographing them and their cowboys at work. Though McQuarrie is not a westerner, he clearly loves his subject matter and speaks glowingly of the men whose images he's captured on film.<br /><br />His 240+ color photographs cover a wide range of subjects besides working with cattle, including snow and frost, children, cowboy gear, Spanish colonial churches, pickup trucks and trailers, rodeo, landscapes, a cowboy wedding, and bringing in a Christmas tree cowboy-style. The photographs are organized according to the seasons, starting with winter, and they range in size up to full double-page spreads.<br /><br />Interspersed are short essays by cowboy humorist Lee Pitts, praising cowboy values in his down-home way, and other writers. The most interesting is a reprint of an article from High Country News about rancher Sid Goodloe, who over a period of 41 years restored a broken down ranch using principles of sound ecology. There's also a foreword by the late cowboy actor and stunt man, Richard Farnsworth.<br /><br />This book easily belongs on any shelf of Southwestern photography.

Author Barbara Van Cleve opens up a subject that for all the many books about ranching is typically slighted - the roles that women have played as ranchers themselves.  The title, Hard Twist, refers to (a) a tightly twisted lariat rope and (b) a small, tough, physically strong person, a survivor. And the women whose stories are told here, often in their own words, are surely survivors, who have worked fiercely to preserve a way of life that they love, many of them on ranches that have been in the same family for generations.<br /><br />In the 120+ black and white photographs collected here, we see women at work and, for a moment, allowing themselves to be photographed at ease. Considerable depths of character emerge in these photographs, and in the personal profiles that accompany them, we read stories of not just amazing life experiences but also affirmations of traditional values, families, and relationships.<br /><br />While male-dominated western literature typically falls somewhat short in its appreciation of the women who help make ranching possible, these accounts reveal the central role of marriage and child-rearing to the success of a family-owned operation. Like Linda Hasselstrom's fine ranch memoir \\"Windbreak,\\" this book explores more deeply the emotional bonds between men and women on the ranches they run.<br /><br />And not all the women introduced here are ranchers' wives. Some are single, divorced, or run the ranch while their husbands pursue other occupations. In addition to ranching, one woman also rides rodeo rough stock.<br /><br />Themes of land conservation, environmental issues, concerns about government intrusion, and the lack of understanding by city dwellers run through many of the interviews. Most of all, the daily life of ranch work is not glamorized but represented for what it is - very hard work with rewards that are soul-satisfying though not significantly monetary.  Included in the book are essays by the author's father, Spike Van Cleve, and western art historian, Michael Duty. An excellent addition to any bookshelf of western literature.monetary.

This handsomely designed book is a tribute to the cowboys of New Mexico and a mixture of both romance and reality. Unlike most books of cowboy photography, with picturesque and colorful shots of riding horses, branding cattle, and the like, this one is devoted simply to black-and-white portrait shots of men and women who have worked ranches all or most of their lives. The accompanying character profiles provide short personal histories with quotes from interviews with them.<br /><br />At intervals are six essays about cowboys by various authors. One traces the history of New Mexico's first cowboys, the vaqueros; another essay describes the pressure from environmentalists on the cattle industry. Another traces the emergence of the cowboy hero in early pulp fiction, literature, movies, TV, and country music, with a still of Kirk Douglas as Jack Burns, cutting a barbed wire fence in \\"Lonely are the Brave.\\"<br /><br />A gem of an essay is a humorous, warm-hearted celebration of cowboys, written in 1937 by cowboy writer John L. Sinclair, called \\"Bow Legs.\\" The photo accompanying this essay is priceless: a rear shot of a bow-legged modern-day cowboy in fringed chaps, striped shirt, and wranglers. Another essay is devoted to ranching and cowboying on New Mexico's Indian reservations, and there are several photos of members of a Navajo ranching family. Meanwhile, the end pages are a reproduction of a striking western panting by artist Gary Morton.<br /><br />Published by New Mexico magazine, this is an excellent addition to any bookshelf of Southwestern photography.	2005-03-06

New York city born, Yale educated, and raised in California, Dayton Lummis has written 100 poems collected here to memorialize all that's remote, isolated, and \\"lonesome\\" about the vanishing American West. These are more monologues than poems, written in the colloquial vernacular of men at home in pickups on strange backroads, a six-pack in the cooler, and an eye for subtle changes of open landscape and changes of weather. Elegiac in tone, the poems are memories of places and people, remembered fragments of barroom conversations, and a record of travels all over the western states.

Reading and sometimes rereading its 275+ pages, I felt immersed in an experience of life on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. This book is unlike the easy generalizations to be found in the superficial coverage provided by the news media (and Frazier uses a Tom Brokaw report on NBC, \\"Tragedy at Pine Ridge,\\" as an example). He offers instead a richly complex portrayal of a single community of modern-day plains Indians, the Oglala Sioux. His book doesn't deny their overwhelming problems, including poverty, unemployment, widespread alcoholism, violent crime, and an alarming rate of highway fatalities. In fact, it explores them at length. But he also demolishes the stereotypes and clich&eacute;s that prevent Indians from being understood as people with hopes, fears, loves, desires, humor, and all the rest that is human.<br /><br />He does this in part through an appreciation of historical figures like Crazy Horse and Red Cloud, a profile of AIM leaders, Russell Means and Dennis Banks, and a moving tribute to star high school basketball player Suanne Big Crow. More intimately, we spend time with Le War Lance, a friend of the author for many years, who introduces Frazier to the lesser-known aspects of reservation life and the many residents he knows.<br /><br />Like much New Yorker writing (Susan Orlean's \\"The Orchid Thief\\" comes to mind) Frazier's book digresses at the drop of a hat into subjects that take on a life of their own - the history of Indians in Hollywood movies, for instance, the stealing of the Black Hills from the Indians, an explanation of how to make fry bread, a laundry list of summer visitors trooping through the reservation's one convenience store and caf&eacute;.<br /><br />And Frazier appears himself as a character in his narrative, at times patiently generous and at others a self-conscious and comical fish out of water. For all the social ills he turns his attention to, he is never preachy or openly guilt inducing, and he doesn't diminish his subject with political correctness. When you turn the last page, the ending seems abrupt and incomplete, but the reason you understand is that the lives of the many people you've met through Frazier go on and the cycles of seasons continue. And you understand why he returns to Pine Ridge again and again. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in American Indians, reservation life, and Native American social history. Frazier makes them all come humorously, sadly and always vividly to life.sn't diminish his subject with political correctness.

Not surprisingly, as in any culture, there are many voices speaking for and about American Indians, representing them from many points of view. Alexie's is one, and the director of \\"Smoke Signals,\\" Chris Eyre, is another. Reading the extensive notes at the end of this screenplay, where Alexie describes the creative decisions that went into the making of the movie, you can see how each of them pushed for a different vision of the material. And the end result is a moving and humorous film about damage done and the journey that leads to healing - a theme certainly appropriate to a story about American Indians but also relevant to people of all cultures.<br /><br />The debate among Alexie's readers is expressed dramatically in the movie, \\"The Business of Fancydancing,\\" in which a writer who makes a career for himself outside the reservation (not unlike Alexie himself) is received coldly by old friends who feel that he's betrayed his people. The violence in that film (against a stranded white tourist) is a darker vision of Indian rage, the seeds of which are represented in the character of Victor, in \\"Smoke Signals.\\" Looking at just these two stories from the same author, you can see something of the competing points of view that can produce either praise or derision for this film, where \\"It's a good day to die\\" is wryly transposed into the wonky observation, \\"It's a good day to be indigenous.\\"<br /><br />I can think of really only one reason for reading this book. For screenwriters, it reveals how a screenplay is transformed in the process of making a movie, in this case by the director, the performers, Miramax's Harvey Weinstein, preview audiences, and in particular the editor. Scenes were shifted or eliminated, and dialogue has been added to patch over some of these structural changes. The result is arguably a very different film from the one Alexie originally wrote.<br /><br />Anyone else should simply buy or rent the DVD.

Poet Dana Gioia raises and answers this question in his essay reprinted in this book. He argues that when poets took jobs in academia teaching creative writing, the practice of poetry criticism languished, allowing good poetry to be lost in a flood of the mediocre. While more poetry is being published now than ever, its audience has shrunk, and it no longer plays a role in the great public discourse on meaning and values in American culture.<br /><br />Working against this trend, however, is the increasing popularity of cowboy poetry, with its growing audience of people who gather annually at cowboy poetry festivals across the country, including the granddaddy of them all in Elko, Nevada, now in its 21st year. Mostly unschooled in poetics, the writers of this poetry are cowboys, ranchers (both male and female), and others whose lives are informed by Western traditions. The spirit driving this output surely goes back to the nineteenth century, when cowboys entertained themselves and each other inventing and reciting doggerel verse about their daily lives and the things that mattered most to them.<br /><br />Rooted as the West is in the rural past, its poetry often seems to come straight from the bedrock of essential American values and national character. Thus its appeal to many who can't relate to the ambiguities, ironies, and self-indulgence of more modern forms of literature. This volume of poems and essays tries to give cowboy poetry legitimacy as literature worthy of the attention it receives. And for the most part, it is successful.<br /><br />Two of my favorite poets, rancher Wallace McRae and rodeo rider Paul Zarzisky, both from Montana, are represented in this anthology. Each pushes the envelope, creating poems that treat unexpected subjects (strip mining, racial discrimination) and depart from the standard abab rhyme scheme, four beats to the bar. Another favorite, poet and writer Linda Hasselstrom, from South Dakota, is also here. And I was taken by the wonderful, more personal poems of Californian Linda Hussa. Altogether there are 20 poets (including a few from the mainstream: Maxine Kumin, Donald Hall), each writing in distinctive styles, illustrating the range and vitality of this new-old cowboy tradition.<br /><br />I loved this book and happily recommend it to anyone with an interest in the West and a curiosity about how poetry might once again speak to more of us.And I was taken by the wonderful, more personal poems of Californian Linda Hussa.

This book is part travelogue, part natural history, part regional history, and part personal memoir. After many years as a writer, poet, and university professor, the author takes an 80-mile journey from his home in Tucson to the old mining town of Bisbee in the southeast corner of Arizona. Just a stone's throw from the Mexican border, Bisbee has been the site of copper mines, starting in the 1880s and lasting until the 1970s, when conglomerate Phelps Dodge finally ceased operation, having created a huge open pit and left mountains of tailings.<br /><br />A mountain town built in the twists and turns of a narrow valley, Bisbee was once the largest city between St. Louis and San Francisco. More amazing today is that unlike most mining towns that sprang up in the West, Bisbee is not a ghost town but still thrives, chiefly as an artists' center and a tourist destination. A high school teacher, fresh out of the Army in the 1950s, Shelton tells of life in a modern-day mining community, and great storyteller that he is, there are entertaining accounts of fitting in to the community, establishing himself as a young teacher, and taking on leadership of a Boy Scout troop given to embarrassing public pranks.<br /><br />But by the time Shelton brings us to Bisbee in the closing chapters of the book, he has lingered lovingly over the flora and fauna of the desert and mountains, provided readers with several hundred years of history in this area once ruled by the fierce Apaches, visited Tombstone (represented as a tourist trap), recalled his tour of duty with the Signal Corps at Ft. Huachuca, got caught in a downpour and had lunch in a roadside diner, and driven his van way off the main road where he finds a young man panning for gold. There is a long, humorous account of a squirrel infestation at his Tucson home and the intervention of a bull snake named Henry. And on and on.<br /><br />I highly recommend this enjoyable book for readers interested in the desert, Arizona, the culture of mining towns, and the social history of the American West.

The title of this book may seem misleading to readers looking for accounts of bawdy behavior on the frontier. Social historian David Dary doesn't pretend that church picnics were the height of fun in the Old West, but much of what his book describes are innocent pastimes. While saloons, brothels, and so-called pleasure palaces do get their mention, the book is chiefly a compendium of simple leisure activities and forms of entertainment.<br /><br />Organized by chapter somewhat roughly by social groups (mountain men, Indians, emigrants, soldiers, cowboys), locations (along rivers, along railroads, in mining areas), and regions (Southwest, Northwest), the book imposes a kind of order over a vast encyclopedia of loosely related information. There's no grand theme, thesis or narrative holding it all together, so casual readers can dip into the book wherever impulse takes them without getting lost.<br /><br />I particularly liked the chapter on soldiers, which briefly summarizes the campaigns of the Army of the West and the establishing of forts during the 19th century. Because the focus is on the passing of time between the waging of war (against Mexico, against the Indians), we get a different picture of military life than is the norm in history books. I enjoyed the accounts taken from the journals of soldiers and officers' wives of simple pleasures taken in the pristine wilderness of the prairie and of social events like theatricals, concerts, Fourth of July celebrations, holiday feasts, and dances organized for entertainment at the forts.<br /><br />Familiar with cowboy culture, I found less that was new to me in the \\"Cow Country\\" chapter, but Dary provides a snapshot of this extensive subject that represents it fairly. His speculations on the rise and evolution of singing cowboys, particularly on the cattle drives, is interesting. Snippets of song lyrics help to illustrate this oral tradition.<br /><br />The book's many photographs and illustrations complement the text well, although the limitations of early photography often required subjects to be stiffly posed. The physical spontaneity that's an essential part of many forms of pleasure eludes the camera. Thus, for instance, there are numerous photos of men playing cards. Altogether the book represents a heroic effort to assemble a picture of a vast subject. The value of this book is less in the overall generalities and more in the specific details, especially in the excerpts from journals and other documents where pleasures taken are vividly described.ent the text well, although the limitations of early photography often required subjects to be stiffly posed.

In his short life (born 1966), he has garnered a truckload of accolades and can lay claim to a wide range of achievements as poet, novelist, screenwriter, filmmaker, public speaker, media personality, humorist, recognized spokesman for Native Americans, and on and on. He's won any number of prizes. And all with the inauspicious beginnings of an Indian boy, growing up on the Spokane reservation in Washington.<br /><br />It's pretty easy to see the promise that is to be found in this early collection of short stories, published when he was still in his twenties. The range of literary forms and voices used to express a complexity of sentiments and a deeply rich sensibility in a writer so young is remarkable. The many customer reviews already posted here (90 as of this writing) attest to the author's impact on his readers. And he is not just a Native American writer. The mix of grief, suppressed rage, and wry  humor in these 22 stories cuts through to universals underlying all cultures.<br /><br />In the title story of the book, the Lone Ranger and Tonto do not make an appearance, let alone fight, but what the relationship between these two men represents to Indians infuses the entire book. This particular story begins and ends with encounters with white men - the first concerning a late-night visit to a 7-11, where the initial fearful suspicion of the white clerk relaxes as his Indian customer starts to joke with him. Later, the narrator is forced to admit that a white basketball player is better than he is. In between, the story tells of his return from the city to live again on the reservation, his concerned mother, a white girlfriend, and an aimlessness that resolves into finding a job. Like Tonto, for better or worse, he makes a place for himself in the white man's world.<br /><br />Probably the best-known story from this collection is \\"This Is What It Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona,\\" made into the film \\"Smoke Signals,\\" about the quirky and unlikely companionship between two young Indians who drive to Arizona to retrieve the remains of the dead father of one of them. My personal favorite, however, is \\"The Approximate Size of My Favorite Tumor,\\" about a dying man who makes light of every adversity. His encounter with a racist, corrupt cop is full of clever, laugh-out-loud wit, and his relationship with his wife is told with deeply tender humor.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book as an introduction to modern Indian literature. It captures for anyone with a mind and heart the complexities of Indian identity that lie behind the stereotypes that prevail in the popular imagination - whether racist or sentimental. Readers of Alexie's books will also like Adrian Louis' novel, \\"Skins.\\",\\" about the quirky and unlikely companionship between two young Indians who drive to Arizona to retrieve the remains of the dead father of one of them.

This short, comic-sad novel tells the first-person story of a ten-year-old boy living in wartime Los Angeles. The year is 1943. Men are off fighting the war; women are riveting planes in the city's aircraft factories. The protagonist, Trygve (nicknamed Monk), lives in a crowded apartment with his mother and her show-business aspiring boyfriend, her sister and her sister's Canadian husband, and his teenage son. Seen through the inexperienced but curious eyes of a boy, these characters form the center of the novel, which traces events in their emotionally tangled, often unstable lives.<br /><br />Impressionable and inquisitive, the young hero is continually instructed in the ill-formed opinions of the older males in his life, while his mostly sensible mother tries without much success to counter-balance her sister's other-worldly reflections on past lives and the tenuousness of this one. Meanwhile, his fevered imagination is fed by the movies and what he hears on his short-wave radio set, as he daydreams of piloting fighter jets only to die melodramatically in the arms of grade school sweethearts. Like everyday life itself, there's no particular plot line to this story, just one thing after another, finally adding up to a kind of worldly wisdom that sometimes comes in times of war, dislocation and anxiety - represented here by the image of Kilroy peeking quizzically over a fence.<br /><br />I recommend this novel to readers interested in the zeitgeist of the 1940s war years (the period details evoke this era wonderfully), Los Angeles, and coming-of-age stories. It will leave you with memories of those years on the verge of puberty, first love, and an ever-elusive maturity.	2004-12-30

Pioneers of strong fortitude, originating in Pennsylvania, her father's family, the Hogelands, are among the first settlers along the headwaters of the Judith River.<br /><br />Good years, wise management, and a faith in the rewards of hard work serve them well - until the early death of the author's grandfather, followed by a decade of severe drought and then the Great Depression. While half of the homesteaders around them go broke and move on, her family continues to scrape a living from the land, the women on her mother's side of the family supplementing their incomes with teaching in remote one-room country schools.<br /><br />Reconstructing her family's story, the author brings vividly to life her father and mother, grandmothers, aunts, and her great-grandparents. She deciphers and transcribes the writings of her great-grandfather Abraham, interviews living relatives, and studies family photographs, many of which are included in her book. While the primary theme of the book is the survival of her family, she also has much to say about the role of women, focusing on the circumstances that invariably compromised their hopes and aspirations.<br /><br />There is her father's mother, Grammy, who does the work of a man while providing home and shelter for a live-in hired man without benefit of clergy. There's her mother's mother, who teaches school into her seventies to support her family and pay for her husband's care in a nursing home. There's the author's aunt Imogen, who remains unmarried and also teaches school. There's the author's mother, who marries a handsome cowboy and then struggles to make a place for herself in her husband's domineering family.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the men in her stories make equally interesting studies, especially her strong-willed father, Jack, who's a natural horseman and top hand; her mother's father, who cannot withstand the pressures of a lonely, hard life on the prairie; and a husband in later years, a wildcat oilman who is in complete denial that he is dying of pulmonary fibrosis.<br /><br />I highly recommend this well-written, absorbing and sometimes harrowing book that renders such a vivid picture of Montana homesteaders and the extremes of rural life. Thanks to the University of Oklahoma Press for keeping it in print.

The story is told by one of four brothers, starting in 1916 when he is a 14-year-old boy and ending in 1946. Told in the first person, it maintains a 1940s sensibility. For even though it tells the story of the narrator's decades-long attraction to his brother's wife, there is still a chasteness about their relationship that would be implausible in a story told 50 years later. Suppressing his own sexuality, the narrator remains inexperienced well into his 30s, and there is a glancingly graceful moment in his story, as a widow he is courting discovers this on their first night together.<br /><br />Moving slowly through 30 years of western history, the novel captures the hard-scrabble life of a family on the plains, with accounts of prairie fire, the withering drought of the Depression years, and finally the beginnings of economic recovery as war rages in Europe and the Pacific. Children are born, young adults grow old. There are marriages, illnesses, accidents, and deaths to be mourned. Personalities clash, and conflicts linger without resolution. One brother drowns, another disappears for periods at a time, one brother turns down a chance to play professional baseball, another marries unwisely. And as the years come and go, the family remains on the ranch, finding strength in the land when they do not find it in each other.<br /><br />Rowland often rises well to the material. The narrator's trip to Omaha, where he secretly meets up with a baseball scout is well told, especially as it includes an encounter with the Negro League pitcher Satchel Paige. An especially vivid scene involves the efforts of two people (the narrator and his sister-in-law) tending to a cow whose womb has prolapsed after giving birth. Their struggle to save the cow, lasting hours, is told in breathtaking detail and grows to an emotional pitch that comes to represent the difficult intensity of their own relationship.<br /><br />I recommend this novel for those interested in the rural West, ranch life, the Depression, and the intricacies of extended families. It's a good solid read.wn relationship. <br /> <br />I recommend this novel for those interested in the rural West, ranch life, the Depression, and the intricacies of extended families.

Set mostly in the towns and rural areas of Montana, his stories are about characters who have survived against the odds - busted marriages, unemployment, jail terms, and a kind of bleak aimlessness. Some struggle to hold onto an identity that will maintain their self respect and some sense of security, but it's often slipping away as life's lessons leave them typically empty-handed.<br /><br />In the title story, a man with a small daughter hopes to start a new life with a new girlfriend and a stolen Mercedes. In another story, a boy watches his parents' marriage come unglued as a young man only a few years older drives off into the night with the boy's mother. Two boys skip school to spend the day with a girl who has run away from home and has spent the previous night in a motel with the married father of one of them. A young man is escorted by his former wife and her new husband to the police, where he reluctantly turns himself in after robbing a convenience store. A game of canasta is interrupted in a young boy's home when his father punches another man in the chest and kills him. A man in a wheelchair goes fishing and discovers that his line is snared in the carcass of a deer. In another story, a biker has a vanity plate on his Harley with the word LOSER.<br /><br />Children and teenagers figure in many of Ford's stories. They are witnesses to the disintegrating lives of the adults who try awkwardly and often unsuccessfully to care for them. All in their innocence or their growing awareness of the world seem destined to lives of loneliness and confusion like their parents. Who they are becomes no more than a thin boundary between bad luck and diminished dreams, muted by the temporary relief of alcohol, sex, and either a groundless optimism or a fatalistic surrender to futility.<br /><br />This is an interesting book to read along with Mary Clearman Blue's \\"All But the Waltz,\\" which describes the tough survivors among Montana homesteaders who were confronted by unimaginable bad luck during the 1920s and 1930s and found the resources within themselves to persevere. Only a generation or two later, Ford's characters seem made of lesser stuff, as though circumstances have reduced a pioneering spirit to exhaustion.<br /><br />Ford is a terrific storyteller. These are wonderfully written stories that for the most part let characters speak for themselves as they puzzle over the meaning of what's happening to them. A sexual tension pervades many of the stories, along with a poignancy that allows characters to preserve a degree of dignity, even as they behave foolishly.z,\\" which describes the tough survivors among Montana homesteaders who were confronted by unimaginable bad luck during the 1920s and 1930s and found the resources within themselves to persevere.

While Montana is cast as \\"the last best place\\" by many of its writers, McGuane seems to see the place as a land of lost hope and illusion. Knee deep in ironies, the story turns in many ways on a faded painting in an abandoned ranch house that Joe, the main character, remembers from boyhood. Grown up now and a painter himself, who doesn't paint anymore, he abandons a Cuban girlfriend in Florida and fetches up after a cross country drive at the old home ranch to spend a season fattening cattle for market while having no faith that much of anything will happen to give his life any direction or purpose.<br /><br />While most of this story takes place in Montana and most of its characters are nominally Montanans, they seem unmoored not only to the land but to any reason for being there. Those who come from elsewhere tire of it and leave. Those who would leave can't. Only a land-hungry rancher Overstreet seems to have a purpose in life, and it's clearly an empty one - buying up more land.<br /><br />An old girlfriend figures in the story, and her jealous husband, and there are family members who are able to betray each other, and do. The relations between men and women swing wildly between romance and erotic encounters to bitterness. Greed lurks darkly everywhere. It's a vision not unlike the one in Larry McMurtry's \\"Texasville.\\" His Duane is a distant cousin of Joe, and it's easy to imagine Jeff Bridges in a movie version of the story - beleaguered and wryly puzzled by what's become of his life. I recommend this novel to anyone ready for an anti-romance about the West, which questions - often humorously and outrageously - most of what the West has stood for in the American imagination.	2004-12-22

His stories are so filled with detail, striking turns of plot, and remarkable, thoroughly believable characters they are almost like novels compressed into just a few pages. In the title story, for instance, two sisters-in-law find themselves living together uncomfortably in a family home now thickly, darkly, and suffocatingly surrounded by spruce trees, which one of them decides to have cut down, with predictable and then quite unexpected results. Long fills in around the story line with incidents from family history, glimpses of other characters, some of them dead and gone. The weather and the seasons are noted in evocative detail. The tone and emotional quality of relationships are conveyed in nuances of behavior and realistic dialogue. You catch your breath at the end of a story, as if returning from a long journey.<br /><br />Long frequently uses women as central characters. The men in their lives are often just walk-ons, especially those for whom there is a romantic interest. They're regarded from a distance as though opaque and almost incomprehensible. The oldest son of a ranching family loses his emotional bearings, is engulfed by a nameless rage and disappears. A woman looks up her brother, who lives in another state, and discovers that he is strangely enmeshed in a hopeless relationship with a demanding invalid. In another story, a woman rents a house from her employer, who takes an unsettling and ambiguous interest in her. A girl has a crush on a boy who leaves college to carry on an affair with a married high school sweetheart.<br /><br />The stories are mostly set in a small town west of the Rockies in northwest Montana. Here people live their lives on a kind of battleground between the weight of family histories, the receding promise of the West, extremes of climate, and personal isolation within a limiting and loosely knit social fabric. I recommend this collection of stories to readers interested in the modern-day West, small-town living, complex characters, and emotional truths expressed in super fine writing.

This is a fine book, a thought-provoking and informative portrayal of a Harvard physician working to save the lives of patients with blood diseases and cancer. However, its title is somewhat misleading. Groopman is first and last a scientist, and there is little that is \\"spiritual\\" or inspirational about his point of view. When he speaks of miracles, it is the advances of medicine in the laboratory he is talking about.<br /><br />Each chapter in the book is devoted to a particular patient, and what Groopman gives readers is a case history describing their symptoms of illness, diagnosis, and courses of treatment. He also devotes attention to the personalities of each of his patients, particularly as they face life and death crossroads in their lives. We come to appreciate that his strength as a doctor is in a combination of training, skill, and an ability to regard patients as individual persons, not just cases of disease.<br /><br />Groopman's approach as a physician is to use medical technology to help his patients buy time, thus allowing them to achieve the full \\"measure of their days,\\" even when that is only a few months or years of remission. While in the early stages some patients seem fatalistic about their potentially fatal illnesses, he discovers that nearly all come around to his belief that life is too precious to surrender when medicine can postpone death.<br /><br />I recommend this book for its clear-eyed and heart-felt description of doing battle against disease and for its well-detailed portrayals of doctor-patient relationships. As companion volumes, I'd also recommend David Biro's \\"100 Days,\\" in which a doctor tells of his own bone marrow transplant, and Abraham Verghese's \\"My Own Country,\\" an Indian-American doctor's AIDS memoir.	2004-12-10

Nashville has not always been the home of country music. Following migrations westward from the South and Dust Bowl states during the 1930s and 1940s, country music flourished in California, where it thrived in Hollywood, throughout the agricultural interior valleys and around the war-related industries in Los Angeles. And it continued in the post-war years, peaking in creative output one final time in the 1960s.<br /><br />Author Gerald Haslam's history of country music in California tells a story full of rich appreciation for its many musical styles, from hillbilly (the Crockett Family, seen on the cover), to the singing cowboys (Gene Autry), to the heyday of western swing  (Bob Wills and Spade Cooley), to Tennessee Ernie Ford, and the Bakersfield music scene, centered around Buck Owens in the 1960s. Haslam then tracks its story since those golden years in the careers of Californians who made it big in the Nashville years, such as Merle Haggard.<br /><br />Haslam's sympathies are clearly with performers who have bucked the homogenizing trends of Nashville and the dominance of a music today that calls itself country but has largely lost contact with its roots. He praises the musical mavericks and outlaws who keep traditional and \\"hard\\" country alive in California, giving special attention to Dwight Yoakum, who stubbornly and fiercely chose Los Angeles as a base to launch a career that got national attention in the 1980s.<br /><br />You may or may not love the author's blue-collar bias. He notes the frequent theme of discontent in traditional country music, characterizing it as the music of the hard-working men and women who labor not always successfully in pursuit of an American dream. Their yearning for simpler times and rural values is a sensibility mostly absent from today's country play lists, with only rare exceptions like Alan Jackson. It's a sentiment that finds its parallel in the traditionalist's dislike for the urban market-driven output of Nashville's lucrative music industry.<br /><br />This is a highly readable book, with over 50 photographs of performers, and it's also a reference based on a good deal of scholarship. There's a 22-page bibliography and both a song title index and a subject index covering another 24 pages. Readers interested in western swing will especially appreciate the author's extensive study of this subject.

This is a truly fine one-volume encyclopedia of country music. Organized both historically and generically, the book is divided into 14 chapters, each discussing a type of music (hillbilly, cowboy, western swing, honky tonk, etc.) and tracing it from the time of its introduction to the present, with an overview followed by entries spotlighting the artists in alphabetical order. The chapter on rockabilly, for instance, includes both Elvis and the Stray Cats. Each entry concludes with brief reviews of recommended recordings.  In addition, there are over 250 photographs of performers and album covers and numerous sidebars with short essays on a variety of topics.<br /><br />The book comes in at almost 600 pages, covering the length and breadth of the subject and making a pretty fair attempt at measuring the depth, as well. To give an idea of the book's scope, the \\"classic\\" stars Johnny Cash and Patsy Cline don't appear until the middle. For anyone who may think country music starts and ends with Nashville, it will come as a surprise that so much of this music originated elsewhere.<br /><br />You can read this book any old way you like, flipping through the pages, letting the pictures catch your eye as you discover favorite performers. If you grew up with country, there's many a trip down memory lane. If you're just discovering country, it is an excellent reference book just filled with information charting the careers of artists and their place in country music history. Well written, handsomely designed, easy to read and enjoy, it's a terrific book that will enhance any fan's love of this great musical tradition.	2004-12-04

This thought provoking and often disturbing book should come with a warning. It will make you question the judgment of your doctor if you or someone you know is ever faced with diagnosis and treatment of a life-threatening illness. Medical science and technology continue to make great strides forward, but following each of the case histories related by Dr. Groopman in this book, you realize how tenuous is the judgment of individual doctors who must advise patients and lead them to decisions affecting their health.<br /><br />Reason, in the delivery of health care, is balanced against intuition, and intuition can take many forms, including doubt, egoism, professional jealousy, impatience, resistance, and anger, all of which appear at one time or another in the stories Groopman tells. Or, as one of his patients says, intuition is reason operating below the level of awareness. Making life-saving decisions is, we realize, a matter of expert guess work, and if there's a lesson here it's that the best guess work comes from intimate knowledge of the patient, which the cost-saving constraints of managed health care often prohibit.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone wondering how much trust to put in the medical profession. A well trained and experienced doctor can still make the difference between life and death, but Groopman shows how patients need to play an active role in decisions about their own health, and that often involves seeking a second opinion and making a choice between incompatible courses of action.	2004-12-01

Unlike Tony Hillerman, whose fictional Navajo world is set with both feet squarely in the real one (you can follow the movements of his characters with an open road atlas beside you), Thomas King's Indians have slipped into a world of clich&eacute;s and conventions that any crime fiction fan will immediately recognize. Never mind that King makes winking references to TV detectives to remind readers that this story is somehow realistic by comparison. The milieu is a fictional Montana (never referred to) that could easily be anywhere in the Mountain Time Zone, north or south of the US-Canada border.<br /><br />Still, readers familiar with small-town antagonisms between Indians and whites will recognize the real-world hostility that underlies the sheriff's abrasive opinion of King's ex-cop DreadfulWater (that's one word with a capital W) who oversteps his role as a crime photographer. Those who know the libertarian spirit of the West will also note how the proliferation of hard-boiled characters common to the genre rather naturally springs from a culture of tough-it-out individualism. Everywhere out here, DreadfulWater wryly observes, lives the holy trinity of liquor, tobacco, and guns.<br /><br />Trumps DreadfulWater is an enjoyable invention, with his cat Freeway, his transplanted Californian sensibilities, his advancing middle years, and his tendency to run out of breath climbing stairs. He comes most to life dealing with the several strong women characters that populate the story even while they keep any prospect for romance pretty much out of the question. One scene that gets a bit further than flirtation gets comically interrupted.<br /><br />One caveat. Readers who loved King's earlier literary fiction will immediately understand why he uses the pseudonym Hartley Goodweather for this entertainment. There's a feint resemblance to King's fine novel \\"Medicine River\\" here, where the central character is also an unmarried Indian photographer living on the fringes of the Rez, but the gentle ironic humor of that novel is replaced here by broad comedy, and with rare exceptions the subtleties are absent. For mystery fans, however, this one will please, as the reviews here already testify.an unmarried Indian photographer living on the fringes of the Rez, but the gentle ironic humor of that novel is replaced here by broad comedy, and with rare exceptions the subtleties are absent.

Kenneth Turan has brought together 150 reviews representing the top 5% of the films he sees as film critic for the Los Angeles Times. The result is a collection of movie reviews for (a) little-known and under-sung films that are (b) for grownup audiences instead of teenagers and (c) available on VHS and DVD.<br /><br />Altogether there are reviews of movies from 39 countries, most of them released over the last dozen or so years, half of them English-language films. The other half are foreign language and documentaries. Turan also includes reviews of 12 classic movies and nine short essays on subjects ranging from Chinese martial arts to pre-code Hollywood films. There are no blockbusters here and very few films you're likely to have seen on HBO. They are instead the movies made with a nod to the inner adult - original, entertaining and wise, while touching on real emotions.<br /><br />While I'd seen most of the English-language films Turan includes, and said \\"yes!\\" to each choice (like \\"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries\\" and \\"Uncle Vanya on 42nd Street\\"), it was the foreign films and documentaries I knew far less about. And with a short list quickly picked from those sections, I went straight to Vidiots in Santa Monica, which had all of them. Starting with two French comedies, \\"The Dinner Game\\" and \\"Un Air de Famille,\\" we were greatly entertained on a lazy Thanksgiving afternoon.<br /><br />Turan has his sensibilities and his film sense all finely tuned. You can trust him to pick the good ones. And you can wonder at the other 95% of not-so-great fare he had to wade through to get to these gems.	2004-11-26

These are not stories written for the little literary magazines but the popular publications of an earlier time, when TV was still something new and the movies were mostly family fare. Laxalt's audience would have found his stories in the Saturday Evening Posts and the men's magazines of the time, and his readers would have been well entertained.<br /><br />The 16 stories in this collection are set chiefly in the author's home state, Nevada, but they show a wide range of interests, character types, and styles of storytelling. There is humor, sentiment, drama, action, and satire, often ending with an unexpected twist. A few are stories about hunting and pursuit. In one of these a prison guard apprehends an escaped convict and then finds himself in a helpless dilemma. There are two fascinating stories about gambling. In one of them, the title story of the collection, a rancher with a $3,000 check in his wallet finds himself fatally drawn into a Reno casino. In another, a man tries to catch a cheating blackjack dealer.<br /><br />Most of these stories seem not to have been published before. The author's preface recalls a rejection letter for the story \\"The Snake Pen,\\" from the editor of Esquire, who considered it not \\"digestible\\" by the magazine's readers. Describing a woman's marriage to a garage mechanic who has a curious way with rattlesnakes, it holds up fifty years later among the best of the whole bunch. As a companion volume to this book, I'd recommend Edward Abbey's \\"The Brave Cowboy,\\" which evokes a similar time and place and style of storytelling.	2004-11-23

Like a number of modern Native American authors, Thomas King tells of life among reservation Indians that's free of stereotypes and sentimentality. His central character, Will, a half-breed, lives and works as a photographer in a town called Medicine River, not far from Alberta's Blackfeet reservation. Somewhat passive and resigned to the lot he has chosen in life, his solitude is disrupted almost daily by Harlen Bigbear, a gregarious friend who knows the business of everyone in the Indian community and actively tries to act in everyone's best interest. In other words, he's a meddler.<br /><br />The novel is a series of loosely strung together incidents, involving Harlen's attempts to make things happen, not the least of which are his efforts to get Will to marry the unmarried mother of a little girl with the unlikely name of South Wing. The present day stories are intercut with flashbacks to Will's past, growing up with a younger brother, their father a white cowboy having long deserted the family. And there are flashbacks to a time in his adult life in Toronto, where he became involved unknowingly with a married woman.<br /><br />I loved the gentle and ironic humor of this novel, the many characters who spring to life from the pages, and the roundabout indirection of Indian dialogue, including the persistent way in which people seem not to listen to each other. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the North American West, modern day Indians, and a style of storytelling that speaks from heart.	2004-11-20

This is a fiercely ambitious book with hundreds of color photographs, plus essays on ranch life by thirteen authors, all with established Western credentials. The photographer, Kathleen Jo Ryan, unlike many who have published books of Western photography, grew up on a ranch and knows her subject from firsthand experience. The contributing authors include the likes of Gretel Ehrlich (The Solace of Open Spaces), David Dary (Cowboy Culture), humorist, novelist, and cowboy poet Baxter Black (Hey, Cowboy, Wanna Get Lucky), and William Kittredge (Hole in the Sky).<br /><br />While it has many photographs that celebrate the vastness and beauty of the rural West, it also focuses on the people who own and work on ranches, identifying always the men and women who appear in the pictures and their jobs. The last section of the book is a long photo gallery of ranchers with a few words from each expressing their love of the life they have chosen. In the book's wish to represent ranch work truthfully, it goes further than similar books, with sequences of photographs showing the births of calves, some with and some without assistance. There are also sections on rodeo, entertainment, and cowboy poetry.<br /><br />Unlike books that chiefly romanticize the West and the life and work of the cowboy, this book has a point of view that is more related to ranch-owning and ranching as a business. Championing traditional values and opposed to the modern spread of soul-less agribusiness, it represents ranchers as they see themselves. At almost 300 pages, it's a hefty book, weighing in at about five pounds. With Kodak as a primary corporate sponsor, it's also a celebration of photography itself.	2004-11-17

Photographer Schreiber is a romanticist of the West, with an eye for the individuals who choose life and hard work in the outdoors. His deep-focus black and white photographs often find their subjects in the foreground against the vast landscape, an empty sky, or a large sparely furnished room. The strenuousness of the work can be seen in photos of men slouched in chairs or on the ground, staring blankly.<br /><br />Some pictures have familiar subjects, such as branding calves and roping horses. Others are nice surprises: four men talking together and leaning across the hood of a Ford pickup, a backyard photo of a wedding party, the groom and two best men in big cowboy hats, a cowboy outside a liquor store holding a flat of six-packs. Schreiber in his introduction says the cowboys he's known embody the qualities of honesty, integrity, sincerity, and kindness. This collection of photographs is a celebration of those values.	2004-11-17

This collection of short essays by various writers is an excellent survey of the everyday practical issues facing college writing center directors and tutors who work with ESL writers. The editors, Bruce and Raforth, are at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where Raforth is the writing center director.<br /><br />The opening chapters on culture and language acquisition open wide the subject of culture shock faced by international students from countries where assumptions about writing, learning, research, and self-expression can be vastly different from American ones. The heart of the book focuses on a variety of aspects dealing directly with tutoring itself - getting started, reading an ESL writer's text, avoiding appropriation, helping ESL writers clarify their intended meaning, looking at the whole text, editing line by line, tutoring ESL writers online, raising questions about plagiarism, and so on. The closing chapters deal with broader issues: the role of writing in higher education abroad, the difficulty of explaining English, and a look at writing centers from the point of view of ESL students.<br /><br />I found this book full of thoughtful and practical reflections on the challenges of helping ESL students master academic writing in American universities. Analysis and opinions are based on research and extend a professional discourse dating back twenty years. Altogether the book is informative and highly accessible, written in plain English, unlike much theory-driven (and often politicized) scholarship on composition and rhetoric today. I recommend it to anyone affiliated with a writing center and especially to tutors who work with ESL students. It would make a fine textbook.	2004-11-17

Readers of Adrian Louis' short stories and his novel, \\"Skins,\\" will find many of the same themes in these 42 poems. Here is the same rage and the same mordant humor, all expressed in his distinctive voice. The big-hearted soul beneath the surface of these poems ranges from bitterness to tenderness - playing on words and ideas, often ribald and raunchy, and then brimming with well-earned sentiment.<br /><br />A departure from the norm in this collection are several from-the-gut love poems, describing his deepening affection for a mentally stricken companion, Colleen. The anguish of this unrequited love, haunted by erotic memories of earlier times, is haunting and heartbreaking. Meanwhile, the poet, turning fifty, recognizes his own advancing middle age, and bids farewell to both love and his own youth. Finally, failing health lands him in surgery and a long season at the doorway of death on the fringes of his own sanity.<br /><br />In the end, it's the journey of a battered heart, still tough and beating strong. I recommend it.	2004-11-13

This collection of 23 short stories is set almost entirely on the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwest South Dakota and the border towns in the Nebraska panhandle. It is the harsh land of the high plains where the seasons are extreme and the lives of Indians balance conditions of poverty and racism against the love of family and home - plus a heavy dose of dark humor.<br /><br />Humor in some of these stories borrows from Native American oral tradition, with shape-shifting characters who are both animal and human - Coyote, Raven, and Bear. Other stories lean more toward social realism, following lives plagued at every turn by misfortune, alcoholism, ill health, domestic violence and ignorance. Though truly horrible things sometimes happen, each story stops somewhere short of bleakness and despair. Demon alcohol, for all the damage it does, and libido-driven adventures still bring periods of relief. And there is affection and caring that present themselves like Old Bear in the last story to speak sweet reason to despair.<br /><br />I recommend this book to readers interested in the modern-day lives of Indians on America's reservations. Adrian Louis, in both his poetry and fiction, offers a bracing corrective to all the sentimental and racist stereotypes held by others. His is a grimly unblinking vision of hard lives that still preserves their humanity.	2004-11-13

Owen Wister, author of the classic western novel, \\"The Virginian\\" (1902), was from a well-established Philadelphia family. Destined for a career in law, he traveled West in 1885, at the age of 25, and fell in love with wide open spaces. Over a half century later, the journals he kept during this and his return trips over the following years were discovered by his children and published, along with some letters home, by his daughter, Fanny Kemble Wister.<br /><br />His early journals are mostly devoted to accounts of hunting expeditions, and it isn't until midway through this book that readers will begin to find matters relating to Wister's career as a writer of western literature. The later journals become more self-consciously notebooks recording impressions that would find their way into his stories, which began to appear in Harpers and other popular magazines during this period. Committed to writing realistic portrayals of the West, he records lists of Western lingo, stories related by the people he meets on his travels, and descriptions of frontier towns.<br /><br />One story, the switching of babies at a dance, finds its way into the novel \\"The Virginian,\\" and so does his account of a traveling companion's vicious abuse of a horse. But besides references to two men, Army Corporal Skirdin and Dean Duke, whom Wister admired, the journals reveal little about his inspiration for the character of the Virginian. The journals are a window into the personality and values of the author who helped invent the cowboy hero (he dislikes traveling salesmen and laments the general lack of American character), but to find the origins of \\"The Virginian,\\" one needs to look very hard between the lines.	2004-11-07

Poet, short story writer, and former journalist, Adrian Louis presents a harshly comic vision of Indian life in this novel set on the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwest South Dakota. He immerses the reader in a compelling mix of Indian and white cultures and the resulting ambiguities, competing worldviews, and conflicted values.<br /><br />Rudy, the Indian cop, portrays these confusing conflicts beautifully, representing both the law in his tribal police uniform and vigilante justice in his blackface and pantyhose mask. Revealing other dimensions of Rudy's confusion, Louis explores his relationship to the women in his life. Married and estranged from his wife, Rudy indulges his growing attraction to his cousin's wife, Stella, while he carries on with other men's wives as well. Meanwhile, afflicted with hypertension, he takes meds that affect his sexual performance, and much of the novel traces the rising and falling cycles of his libido, all of which are unpredictable and seemingly under the spell of forces beyond him. It is significant that Iktomi, the trickster spirit and shape-shifter, is a central theme in the novel, for appearance and reality, wisdom and stupidity, pride and shame, love and rage are all in a continuing dance for dominance.<br /><br />Also at the center of the story is Rudy's relationship with his alcoholic older brother, Mogey. While casting an unblinking eye on the devastating impact of alcohol consumption on the reservation, Louis both condemns and forgives those who seek oblivion in the bottom of the bottle. In his hands, Mogey is a wonderful creation. While there are vague allusions to the grim effect of two tours of duty in Vietnam, Louis doesn't excuse Mogey for choosing his path of self-destruction. Yet through his brother Rudy, the reader can begin to understand the deep love possible for someone unable to resist the pull of despair.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone, as some of the reviews already posted here indicate. However, I recommend it highly for what it has to say about the Indian nations - in their own voices and without the moralizing or sentimentality of those who have never walked in their shoes.

The author, who teaches at Black Hills State University, has written a story of people in the reservation and ranchland of central South Dakota that strikes far deeper than his previous, Minnesota-based short stories (\\"Light in the Crossing,\\" which is terrific) and novel, \\"The River Warren.\\" A slender plot-line for its 400+ pages, it glows with intensity at each turn, and while your desire to know what happens next presses you onward, you pause along with the author to reflect on the thoughts and feelings of the characters who are pulled into the flow of events that begins with the purchase of a horse and leads inevitably to the burning of a house.<br /><br />There is humor, suspense, family drama, surprises, ironies of all kinds, a smoldering romance, conflicts, animosity, suspense, farce, triumphs and sorrows in Meyers' novel. And all is woven around a continuing meditation on moral complexity and finally the great difficulty of doing the right thing when there are deep emotions, conflicting points of view and only degrees of violence and loss to choose from.<br /><br />The four young men at the center of this story, two Indians, a cowboy, and a German exchange student, each bears a legacy of history that pulls them together in the single effort to rescue three horses. Meyers makes them come to life vividly through action, thought, and dialogue. Around them is another dozen or so characters, just as carefully drawn and revealed through illuminating flashes of incident. And as in his other work, there is the continuing presence of the landscape and the seasons, as summer turns to autumn and snow-driven winter.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the West, richly detailed and engaging characters, and multi-layered narrative where ironic parallels multiply and fascinating ambiguities abound. Especially interesting is the characterization of the young cowboy, whose ancestry in American literature dates back to Owen Wister's Virginian. Here is that same set of values, courage, pure-heartedness, and self-containment, 100 years later, set in conflict with a cunning villain. It is moving to learn what has become of him.ister's Virginian.

One of the finest books written about growing up in the West is Mark Spragg's memoir, \\"Where Rivers Change Direction.\\" He's also a talented screenwriter whose \\"Everything That Rises\\" is a touching film about a rancher father and young son. So I've found myself expecting probably too much from his fiction. \\"The Fruit of Stone\\" and \\"An Unfinished Life\\" seem to lack the sparkling brilliance and deep truth of his earlier work, and I wish it wasn't so. When Spragg is good, he breaks your heart.<br /><br />\\"An Unfinished Life\\" reads much like a film script. It moves along in the present tense and is largely visual, describing behavior and capturing dialogue, but often staying just on the surface and not getting to the emotional heart of a scene. The characters and situations are often a little too predictable; you feel that you've seen and heard them already somewhere else. Dedicated to author Kent Haruf (\\"Plainsong\\"), the book seems rather much inspired by that author's small-town characters of three generations. You keep wishing Spragg would just yield to his own vision, which if his memoir is any indication, has to be deeper, darker, more troubling, and powerful.<br /><br />Having said all that, I won't discourage readers from enjoying many of the pleasures that are to be found in this novel. A master of quirky dialogue, Spragg writes several scenes, mostly between the two old men at the center of the story, full of quiet verbal sparring that makes their relationship spring to life. The tentative friendship between a young sheriff and a woman on the run from an abusive husband keeps us interested. And his journey into the mind of the husband who stalks her is thoroughly creepy and disturbing.<br /><br />But for readers who don't know Spragg, I'd point them instead to his memoir, \\"Where Rivers Change Direction.\\" It's the real thing.	2004-10-21

Nathan Howard \\"Jack\\" Thorp (1867-1940) was the pioneer collector of cowboy songs, publishing the first edition of this book in 1908 and then expanding it in 1921 to its present length of 101 songs and poems, a quarter of them authored by Thorp himself. Thorp was born and educated in the East but cowboyed as a young man in Nebraska and the Southwest, eventually settling in New Mexico, where he owned his own ranch. From an early age he began transcribing the songs he heard sung by cowboys. Although cowboy poetry thrives today, these early examples of this oral tradition would have surely disappeared without the efforts of Thorp and a handful of other collectors.<br /><br />The songs capture the spirit, humor, and language of working cowboys, although the full scope of language is probably not well represented since many of their songs were too ribald and obscene for publication in 1921. The sentiments range from youthful boasting and celebration of cowboy life to complaints about the hard work to nostalgic reminiscences about old trail pals to mournful laments about loneliness, misfortune, and death (\\"oh, bury me not on the lone prairie\\"). Thorp's own contribution to the tradition, \\"Little Joe, the Wrangler,\\" became popular and was widely recorded. It tells of a brave young wrangler killed in a cattle stampede.<br /><br />Readers who want to know about \\"real\\" cowboys will enjoy this book. It opens a window into the minds and hearts of this fraternity of young horsemen, which flourished for a few short decades in a world that was already being mythologized before it passed into history.	2004-10-16

For anyone fascinated by how the myth of the Western hero came into being, this is the book to read. Published in 1902, it became hugely popular for decades and inspired movies (a version with Gary Cooper in 1929) and a long-running TV series (1962-1971). A modern reader could easily guess the storyline without reading a synopsis - the classic elements are all there: tall, dark, handsome cowboy hero; pretty schoolmarm from back East; the villain who must finally face justice at the end of a gun.<br /><br />Few historical novels are dedicated to American presidents, however, and another whole dimension of the novel opens up with the name appearing on the dedication page -- Theodore Roosevelt, a college friend of the author's. What Wister does, besides telling a story of adventure and romance, is portray a particular kind of heroic figure, a natural man whose integrity is untainted by the corrupt (though civilized) values of the East.<br /><br />The book is a deliberate and often worshipful character study for the age of Teddy Roosevelt-style masculinity. The young Virginian charms us (and the narrator) with his courage and modesty and his thoughtful attempts to understand a world in which some men (even good ones) act dishonorably and make cowardly choices. Stoic and cool on the surface, the currents of sentiment run deep in this man. So does the will to self-improvement, as he reads Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott.<br /><br />This book connects with so much of American myth over the last 100 years that you could easily write another book about it. Or you can simply enjoy it for what it is, a historical romance so well conceived, in spite of its sometimes dated views, that you keep on reading through each episode of the story, glad that Wister was in no hurry to cut to the chase. This is a book for any reader of Western literature, fiction or nonfiction. In it the many traditions of the western come together in popularized form for the first time.<br /><br />Readers who enjoy this book will also like Elmer Kelton's novel, \\"The Day the Cowboys Quit.\\" While it's more historically accurate in its portrayal of working cowboys, it captures many of Wister's same narrative elements, in the courage, modesty and thoughtfulness of its hero, its portrayal of the relationship between a top hand and his boss, its fateful pursuit of cattle rustlers, an account of a troubled friendship between two men, and of course the loneliness and yearning at the heart of a man who loves a woman from afar./>Readers who enjoy this book will also like Elmer Kelton's novel, \\"The Day the Cowboys Quit.\\" While it's more historically accurate in its portrayal of working cowboys, it captures many of Wister's same narrative elements, in the courage, modesty and thoughtfulness of its hero, its portrayal of the relationship between a top hand and his boss, its fateful pursuit of cattle rustlers, an account of a troubled friendship between two men, and of course the loneliness and yearning at the heart of a man who loves a woman from afar.  <br /> <br />  <br />	2004-10-16

I smiled and finally laughed out loud reading this wonderful book by Princeton-educated historian Philip Ashton Rollins (1869-1950), who grew up in the West and knew early cowboys firsthand. He organizes his encyclopedic knowledge of cowboys into 18 chapters covering such topics as cowboy character, what the cowboy wore, equipment and furnishings, diversions and recreations, the day's work, branding and round-up. At 383 pages in its 1936 edition, there's a lot of reading here for the Western enthusiast.<br /><br />The subtitle of the book, \\"an unconventional history,\\" alludes to the less than objective, tongue in cheek tone that Rollins often assumes. He obviously admires cowboys but also sees the latent humor and ironies in a hyper-male culture, where men on the open range bonded into a fierce fraternity of individuals. I laughed out loud at the point where he describes the boredom that led cowboys to memorize the labels on canned products (condensed milk, peaches) and then recite them in unison for amazed outsiders.<br /><br />For readers fascinated by the minute details of the cowboy's daily life, his beliefs and customs, values and attitudes, habits, quirks, and prejudices, this book is a gem. You learn how cowboys wore their Stetsons differently in different regions of the West. Because Rollins is fascinated by language, you learn a great deal about cowboy lingo and how it also varied regionally. He also gets as close as he can to describing the particularly florid and inventive cursing of cowboys. You learn that cowboys wore vests but not denim. You learn the received method of one-handed cigarette rolling and lighting a match on the seat of one's pants. You learn how guns were worn and used. You learn plenty.<br /><br />I'm happy to recommend this book on cowboy culture to anyone with an interest in the old west and the life of cowboys as it was actually lived. It was written and published in 1922, then revised in 1936, and is a classic that belongs on anyone's bookshelf of western literature.anyone's bookshelf of western literature.  <br />	2004-10-08

This book begins with the stereotypical Hollywood image of the Old West saloon, together with a still from a western movie, in which John Wayne and Marlene Dietrich look on as a barroom brawl is about to commence. Then the author quickly takes the reader back to the real west, and there follows an entertaining and informative account of the saloon as it emerged as a social institution on the 19th century frontier, flourished until the turn of the century, fell on hard times and then disappeared with the arrival of Prohibition.<br /><br />The author covers a range of subjects in a series of 15 chapters, each devoted to a topic such as the colonial origins of the drinking establishment, its first rude appearances on the prairies and in the mining camps, the furnishings of bars, the various dimensions of social life in the western saloon, what drinkers drank, bars providing sleeping accommodations, the uneasy relationship between saloons and frontier religion, gambling, entertainment, women in bars, and barroom violence.<br /><br />As social history, this study of the western saloon is rich with anecdotes, amusing stories, and an appreciation for the ironies inherent in the subject. A number of historical figures have walk-ons, including Billy the Kid, Bat Masterson, Wild Bill Hickock, and Buffalo Bill. Not to mention personages of note whose careers took them to the West: Sarah Bernhardt, Oscar Wilde, and Lola Montez.<br /><br />Most interesting to this reader was the chapter on various forms of the quite literal \\"rotgut\\" consumed on the range and in the mining camps. Also of interest was the chapter on entertainment and the musical and theatrical productions, including Shakespeare and opera, that found avid audiences among saloon-goers. Maybe most informative is the author's putting together of the evolution of the saloon itself - its quick ascendance from humble beginnings to a central role in the male-dominated social life of the frontier.<br /><br />Well researched, the book draws heavily on contemporary sources, including newspaper accounts, memoirs, almanacs, and songs. The book makes use of 150 well-chosen illustrations and photographs, several pages of notes, a lengthy bibliography, and an index. It's an excellent reference for the bookshelf of any Western enthusiast.researched, the book draws heavily on contemporary sources, including newspaper accounts, memoirs, almanacs, and songs.

I'm not a stranger to James but far from knowledgeable about his life and work, and I picked up this book in hopes of gaining a glimpse inside the man whose novels I have always found somewhat difficult. And To&iacute;b&iacute;n certainly provides that. Yet a glimpse into a mystery points to more mysteries, and one is left at the end of this novel with a conviction that no creative person - perhaps no person - can ever be really known.<br /><br />There are many ways to read this novel, because there are so many ways To&iacute;b&iacute;n chooses to reveal James. Fascinating for me was how James' experiences and the people he knew or knew of found their way into his stories and novels. The various threads of real-life drama that weave together into the idea that becomes \\"The Turn of the Screw,\\" for instance, make an intriguing study. It's doubly interesting that this process is explored by a storyteller gifted in his own right.<br /><br />To&iacute;b&iacute;n also explores the moral dimension of transforming real lives into fictional ones. He looks rather hard at how James' apparent emotional neglect of the people nearest him didn't prevent him from appropriating their vulnerabilities for his own ends as a writer. We see him as much as abandon those who need him. Then after their deaths, he gives them life again in his stories, where he can control their fates. The ironies of this process double-back on him as he finds himself playing a role in a scene he sees as imagined by a novelist friend who has committed suicide. And again, he recognizes his relationship with a young sculptor as similar to that of two men in a novel he wrote long before - only to discover that his actual life does not take on the narrative shape he has hoped for.<br /><br />Readers eager for revelations about James' sexuality will be disappointed. To&iacute;b&iacute;n represents James as fiercely defended against anything so inappropriate as erotic attraction between men. Even his estimation of Oscar Wilde, whose plays he dislikes, is based on the man's disregard for the impact of his behavior on his wife and children. In an age when such self-closeting is considered almost pathological, it's hard to accept this portrait as anything but dishonest. But I suspect that it's close to the truth, and the interplay between James' insight into character and motive and blindness to his own adds a dimension to this novel that makes it a richly rewarding read.the man's disregard for the impact of his behavior on his wife and children.

Currently there is no review here for this fine book, and it deserves one. For starters, the title for this well-researched history of 400 years of cattle raising in North America is not exactly right. It should be called \\"Cattle Culture,\\" because cattle and not cowboys are at the center of the story the author tells. And his story traces their introduction to the New World by Columbus in 1494 through to the end of the open ranges in the American West in the late 1800s. Horses, also introduced by the Spanish, are no less a part of that story, along with the cattlemen who owned, bought, sold and sometimes stole cattle, and the horsemen (vaqueros, buckaroos, and cowboys) who worked the cattle.<br /><br />Readers learn a great deal about cattle as a business, how the price of livestock fluctuated with demand and depended always on getting cattle to market, often many hundreds of difficult miles away. In some periods, the value of cattle was not in the beef on the hoof but in the hides and tallow. The California vaqueros, we learn, were not just herders but also expert slaughterers of cattle.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, a great swath of Texas history is interwoven with the rising and falling fortunes of cattlemen, and the author puts together a detailed picture of the industry as it emerged there in the mid-19th century, foundered during the Civil War, and then flourished as the railheads worked west into Kansas. But the cattle drives from Texas to cow-towns like Abilene were only some of the many that the century witnessed, as herds were driven in various directions, sometimes by west-bound settlers on the Oregon Trail, or often to meet the sudden demand for beef wherever there were gold strikes. The author provides accounts of many of these, illustrated with maps.<br /><br />There are many black and white period photographs in the book, which challenge the back-lot Hollywood imagery that readers are likely to have of the West. There are also informative illustrations, like that of the early western bridle called a j&aacute;quima by the Spanish-speaking vaqueros, later anglicized to \\"hackamore\\" by their American counterparts. The reader learns of many words flowing from Spanish into English, including \\"ranch,\\" from the Spanish \\"rancho.\\" The meanings of Spanish words like \\"hacienda\\" (a place where work is done) are also clarified. There are also illustrations of how to throw ropes in different ways to catch cattle and horses, how to dally a rope around a saddle horn, and the design of various kinds of barbed wire.<br /><br />One chapter, \\"Bunkhouse Culture,\\" is devoted to describing the fraternity of young men, mostly from the South, who came to be the Texas \\"cow-boys\\" that eventually emerged as the mythic figures on horseback that excited popular imagination. The author describes the unspoken \\"code\\" that bound them together and notes their quick passing from history as long-range drovers when barbed wire brought an end to the open range starting in the 1870s. About the same time, ranching as a corporate enterprise transformed the old conditions of loyalty between cowman and cowboy that characterized the earlier years. And so 400 years of history drew to a close.<br /><br />At 300+ pages, plus another 50 of notes and an index, the book is not a quick page-turner. It reads instead like a very informative and often entertaining textbook on its subject, drawing heavily on contemporary accounts from diaries, journals, and newspapers. Doing so, it brings the past to life with people, personalities, and arresting incidents. I'm happy to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the American West, the origins and development of the cattle industry, and the interplay between cattle, politics, economics, and social history.ations, like that of the early western bridle called a jquima by the Spanish-speaking vaqueros, later anglicized to \\"hackamore\\" by their American counterparts.

Many are vintage black-and-white photographs; most are richly colored photos of modern-day ranch life and people by photographer Dudley Witney. The text is provided by B. Byron Price, executive director of the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center in Oklahoma City.<br /><br />The first section of the book \\"Open Range,\\" focuses on the post-Civil War period, when the cowboy emerged as a historical figure before being transformed by dime novels, Wild West shows, and journalists into the mythic hero figure we know today. The photographs show men at work, herding cattle, breaking horses, branding, dipping cattle for ticks, cooking food at the chuck wagon, bringing cattle to the railheads. In all there is the presence of the wide-open prairies under big skies.<br /><br />In the next section, \\"The New Order,\\" the camera captures a different kind of imagery, richly colorful, with many different kinds of landscape - snow-covered rolling hills, summer meadows, buttes, mists hanging against mountainsides. In the accompanying essay, cowboy history moves forward from the 1880s into the 20th century.<br /><br />In the third section, \\"The Legacy,\\" there is a series of photographs of ranch houses, some dating from the 19th century, ranch buildings, interiors and exteriors, vintage pickup trucks, hand-painted signs, cook houses, old and new.  The accompanying essay follows the story of cattle ranching and cowboying into the mid-20th century. The book closes with a series of portrait photography, representing the men and women who currently live in the west and carry on western traditions.<br /><br />This is a fine and informative book, well worth acquiring for the Western American bookshelf.	2004-09-11

This book of Western photography took a while to grow on me. It took reading Verlyn Klinkenborg's brief essays introducing each section to help me see them in a way the photographer, Lindy Smith, seems to intend. Smith clearly shows us a West stripped of the mental imagery and expectations that urban dwellers and non-Westerners bring to the subject matter. There's an absence of stereotypes and calendar art. Instead, there's an attempt to capture the everydayness of life in the West - an everydayness that's recognizable on the surface, but different the longer you look at the pictures.<br /><br />Smith makes an effort not to idealize the life of Westerners. They are first of all working people. They have jobs to do, and the work is hard, much of it outdoors in fierce heat, stormy weather, and bone-chilling cold. Their clothes are worn, and often there is a worn look on their faces. It's a world of men and women and children and one that includes horses, dogs, other animals and wildlife. As Klinkenborg points out, living and working with animals produces a person with a very different kind of self-awareness.<br /><br />The pictures were taken in the 1990s. All of them (I count 89) are black and white, an attempt no doubt to avoid prettifying the subject matter with color. Most of them were taken in Wyoming, some in Montana, and other states, although in most cases, the landscape has an unusual sameness. There are interiors of barns, shots of working with cattle and horses in corrals, shoeing horses, mending fence, sitting on fences, lying in the grass, riding horses, hunting, droving and inoculating sheep. Some people stand or sit for the camera.<br /><br />A favorite of mine is a simple picture of Klinkenborg himself on a horse, backs to the camera, both of them looking to the right over a grassy Colorado field fenced in with barb wire. Beyond is a broad lone tree, maybe a cottonwood, silhouetted against an unsettled, overcast sky, and in the distance along a flat horizon, the pylons of high-tension power lines. It captures many of the themes of the book. I recommend this collection of photographs to anyone with an interest in the real, new West.flat horizon, the pylons of high-tension power lines.

The point of view of English photographer, Jon Nicholson, is that the traditional cowboy is being crowded out by the 21st century because urban sprawl, interstates, drought, environmentalists, and intrusive government are making ranching a thing of the past. So it's interesting to see what this Englishman sees in the viewfinder of his camera. In general, the 250+ color and sepia-tinted photographs in this collection don't really bear out his thesis. What we see is hard-working men and women with cattle, horses, and open countryside, much the same as it's all been for decades. This world may be vanishing, but it's hard to tell that from the photographs.<br /><br />Nicholson visited the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Wyoming, as well as a ranching state we don't normally think of - Hawaii. There are pictures of branding, riding, herding, feeding cattle, rodeoing, playing pool, playing music, boot making, sitting by the campfire, eating chow, and standing around talking or just waiting. Most of the pictures are what you'd expect. But there are exceptions . . .<br /><br />You pretty rarely see a cowboy's tan lines, but Nicholson has caught them in a shot of a rancher who's cooling off by sitting in a stock tank. In a winter picture, the same man is seen fully dressed, standing in snow and chopping ice from a water trough. A picture taken from behind a herd of cows and calves moving into the distance gives an idea of what it was like on an old-time cattle drive day after dusty, scorching day across the open range.<br /><br />A few photographs of distance capture the vastness of the Western landscape: heavy clouds hanging over the upright poles at each side of a double wooden gate, a windmill against a far-off ridge, jagged lightning striking from storm clouds along a flat, straight paved road aimed straight at a vanishing point on a flat horizon. Meanwhile, in Amarillo, the stockyards have the same effect, stretching out flat in all directions.<br /><br />There are a few indications that times are changing. In Arizona, hand-lettered signs advertise a ranch for sale. A Wyoming rancher stands in a feedlot in a black cowboy hat while his 18-year-old son sits on the tailgate of a Dodge 4x4, wearing boots and a Bulls ball cap. A cowboy sits at a table drinking a longneck bottle of light beer. In another shot, a pickup with a stock rack heads off into endless, empty rangeland with the horse in back and the rider driving.<br /><br />There's a lot to look at and enjoy in these pictures, whether you think the world of cowboys is vanishing or not, and I'm happy to recommend it..  <br /> <br />There are a few indications that times are changing.

I have known about this book for a long time and wish now that I'd read it years ago. It is a retelling of the Western American saga, with a focus on cattlemen and cowboys and, as the title indicates, the presence of black Americans among them. The all-white collective picture of the West is largely the creation of Hollywood, whose images and stories so dominate the memory of our own past.<br /><br />The two UCLA professors whose research this book represents have done more than simply prove that there were large numbers of black cowboys. They hardly even take time to lament the erasure of blacks from this chapter of our history. Instead, they're eager to share with us what they've discovered in their research. And they enthusiastically assemble for us a social history of the Wild West that is peopled in nearly every walk of life with black Americans, both law-abiding and criminal, essentially reflecting the entire demographic of the West itself.<br /><br />The book's chapters follow the spread of the cattle business from early days in Texas before the Civil War to the states west and north, reaching all the way to Montana by the 1880s. The great cattle drives are described, and using an extensive array of contemporary documents, the authors establish the role of young black men on horseback as equals to their white compatriots. Growing older, many became cooks for the cowboy crews, while younger and lesser-experienced black men wrangled the cowboys' horses.<br /><br />Meanwhile, because newspapers tended to focus on violence and mayhem, the presence of many blacks in the American West has been recorded by the press in reports of shootings, murders, and other crimes. More typically blacks were victims, but that was not always the case. The more pastoral versions of some portrayals of the West pale in comparison with Durham and Jones' account, which tends to give a more tabloid sensationalism to their material.<br /><br />Finally, the book gives us a vast panorama of men and women of all kinds participating in this mythic period of American history. Reading this book, you will have your mental picture of the Wild West illuminated by story after story, in the voices of those who lived and remembered those times. And your sense of American history will be thoroughly readjusted.

The author draws on contemporary documents to characterize the lives of men in the American West, driven by dreams of riches, adventure, opportunity, or by simple restlessness that took them to where lawlessness prevailed and men outnumbered women seven to one. The breadth of her subject means that she can touch only lightly on any area of interest (mountain men, pioneers, miners, gamblers, lawmen, outlaws, cowboys, the military, settlers, and so on), but the details she chooses bring each of these subjects vividly to life for its brief moment in the spotlight.<br /><br />Most vivid and fascinating, however, are the photographs selected for the book. Unlike the often-fuzzy reproduction in books of this type, these are crisply focused with strong contrast, so you can study them at length for the many details captured by the camera. Many are posed shots, and many are wonderfully candid, like a photograph of Texas cowboys bathing outdoors or getting a shave in the bunkhouse.<br /><br />Some of my favorites in the book include pictures of several Army men on horseback surveying a vast Indian encampment (c. 1889); six men tipped back in their chairs in front of a hotel in Nome, Alaska, while several steps down the raised wooden planks of the sidewalk a woman sits with a baby carriage (1905); five Chinese men with open books, perhaps a choir, standing at the back of a softly lighted room identified as the Chinese Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles (1895); men and boys posing with two teams of horses pulling a wagon and a buggy in the prairie grass, while behind them in the distance is a raw cluster of buildings identified as Comstock, Nebraska (1904). The book includes a list of 200+ references, such as Everett Dick's classic \\"Sod-House Frontier, 1854-1940.\\"<br /><br />I'm happy to recommend this book to anyone wanting an introduction to the social history of the American West, with an emphasis on the roles played by men.the roles played by men.  <br />	2004-08-21

Hood, is much in the manner of Larry McMurtry's \\"The Last Picture Show.\\" There's a similar range of characters, some young, some middle-aged, at various points in their lives, rich and poor and in-between. Some are lost, some misguided, some a ball of barely contained rage, and one or two have come to terms with life's contingencies and live with a kind of reserve and grace that hark back to an earlier time when lives (as we imagine them) were simpler. With its healthy share of melodrama - a knife fight, a near rape, a racist deputy sheriff, drownings, and so on - there's also some of Mississippi writer Larry Brown (\\"Father and Son\\") in this novel.<br /><br />Altogether, it's a good read. Irsfeld captures the Texas argot of its characters, who hang out at the City Caf&eacute;, and notes the oddities of social behavior (how men wear cowboy hats, the use of cotton balls on screens to keep out flies) as well as the extremes of rural poverty - the cedar burners who live beyond the edges of modern civilization. I recommend this book to readers interested in 1970s Texas and a style of storytelling that can be found in Larry McMurtry and Larry Brown.	2004-08-19

Ryan Taylor is a fourth generation rancher near the small town of Towner (pop. 867) in north-central North Dakota. In his 20s and unmarried, when the material in this book was written, Taylor is a columnist for Ag Week, commenting with tongue in cheek on the ironies and oddities of modern-day ranching.<br /><br />The 190+ short columns collected between these covers reflect on nearly any subject likely to cross the mind of a thoughtful rancher or farmer while cutting hay, fixing fence, or mucking out the barn. A frequent theme is the negative economics of balancing the costs of operation against invariably falling farm prices. And he frequently considers alternative forms of income, weighing in, for instance, on the subject of Rocky Mountain oysters, which if marketed as a high-priced gourmet food, like caviar, could make up for what little the rest of the calf is worth on the market.<br /><br />We accompany him on trips to farm auctions in hopes of finding an old tractor or hay baler with some life left in it. We consider with him the many uses for vice grip wrenches (which also make great wedding gifts, he argues). There's a discussion of the effect of rainy weather on the many shapes that a hayfield can take as he dodges around the wet spots. There's a rumination on the difficulty of wiping out the evil weed, spurge. And so on.<br /><br />Readers familiar with the trials and tribulations of making a living from ranching or farming will find the author wryly entertaining. For other readers, his book also offers an insight into a rural frame of mind in the late 20th century, its values, beliefs, and concerns, not to mention its politics and somewhat jaundiced view of government, bureaucracy, and city folk. In that regard, Taylor is a direct descendant of Will Rogers. In his public speaking engagements (he studied mass communications in college), he even does rope tricks.	2004-08-19

His love of working cowboys, his respect for horses, and his devotion to the fraternity of men who worked cattle and horses on the open range give his stories an easy warmth - like a comfortable old boot. This book is a collection of his early stories first published in national magazines as his writing career suddenly took off in the 1920s. They are fictionalized autobiography, told in the first person by the drifting cowboy of the title, a young man named Bill, who is an accomplished bronc rider.<br /><br />The stories are told in a leisurely fashion, in the unpolished, ungrammatical jargon of someone sitting around a cow camp swapping yarns with the other boys. The pace seems very slow until you realize that James is trying to capture not the drama but the everydayness of cowboy life. Even while he idealizes his subject, he wants us to feel what it is really like - the grueling, dangerous work of herding cattle that are likely to stampede without warning; the fruitless search for work in lean times; the struggle to keep cattle fed and watered in the desert.<br /><br />Competing in a local rodeo, Bill and his friend Tommy have to outwit the promoters, who rig the results with unfair judges and by manipulating the draw, but what is interesting about this story is the actual experience of being a rodeo cowboy. Our heroes participate in several events (unlike today), and James conveys the mixture of excitement, nerves, disappointment, and triumph that his heroes feel.<br /><br />Most striking about the stories is James' capturing of the spirit of fraternity among cowboys, their generosity, and their gallantry. For all their toughness and fierce disregard for personal injury, there is a gentleness in them that makes these stories almost endearing. And in their tendency to \\"drift,\\" there's a dedicated individualism that is tempered by loneliness and melancholy. Reading James, it's easy to see how he helped to create the myth of the cowboy in the American imagination.<br /><br />I'm happy to recommend this book. There are seven wonderful stories and 44 of his carefully detailed illustrations, most of them featuring horses with hooves flying and lean cowboys with big hats, who look a lot like James himself in his photographs.the myth of the cowboy in the American imagination. <br /> <br />I'm happy to recommend this book.

Bramlett's book is not quite what the title suggests. The story of the \\"real\\" Will James would take a more objective eye, and this author is probably too much a fan to give us the reality behind the persona of the Montana cowboy who captured the imagination of readers in the 1920s and 1930s.<br /><br />But there's a great deal in this book to enjoy, especially the hundreds of photographs of James and his friends, of ranching in the early 20th century, and reproductions of many of his illustrations and covers of his books. There are also reminiscences of people who knew him, including his wife, Alice.<br /><br />Born Ernest Nephtali Dufault in Quebec in 1882, Will James reinvented himself as a \\"drifting cowboy\\" in the Western states, serving time briefly in a Nevada prison for stealing cattle, and reinvented himself again as a writer-illustrator in the 1920s, becoming famous almost overnight for his short stories and graphic images of cowboys and horses. In his book, Bramlett recounts his all-too-brief career as a celebrated and loved icon of the West, which ended in 1942 after a long bout with alcoholism.<br /><br />Readers looking for an evaluation of James' literary output won't find it in the pages of Bramlett's book. He gives no estimation of James' place in the literature of the West. Neither is this a proper biography. But for the casual reader and Western enthusiast, the book's quick and engaging overview of James' life, with its multitude of interesting photographs, will do quite nicely.	2004-08-14

It was one of Edward Abbey's regrets that he was appreciated more for his nature writing (\\"Desert Solitaire\\") than his fiction. And it was another regret that he was mostly forgotten as the author of the story on which the movie \\"Lonely are the Brave\\" was based. However, after reading \\"The Brave Cowboy,\\" I'd have to vote with those who find his nonfiction far more inspiring and satisfying. It's a novel that still rewards the reading, but almost 50 years after its publication in 1956, it seems somewhat dated, while \\"Desert Solitaire\\" remains as fresh and relevant as if it were written yesterday.<br /><br />Abbey was still in his twenties when he wrote this novel, and its point of view is that of a young man full contradictory passions and attitudes. The brave cowboy of the title, a prototypical figure on horseback, is the central character in maybe half the pages of the novel. A younger college friend, imprisoned for refusing to register for the draft, is another character. The local sheriff gets a large section to himself. The novel also follows the progress of a long-haul truck driver across the country. The lives of these four characters intersect in the narrative, while each of them also represents a different perspective. And they don't all quite converge in a single point of view. But that was Abbey, an outspoken man who wasn't afraid to contradict himself.<br /><br />To its credit, the novel can be read on more than one level. It uses the cowboy to represent free-spirited, libertarian ideas set in conflict with brute ignorance and repression. It decries urbanization and celebrates the limitless, stark beauty of the mountains and desert (the novel is set in northern New Mexico). It's also a prison drama, and it tells a satirical yet gripping story of heavily armed but mostly inept law officers in pursuit of a fugitive. A reader interested in a 1950s view of the West and its people in post-war transition will find much to enjoy in Abbey's youthful book about a mythic cowboy's adventure and the lives it disrupts.<br /><br />As a companion volume, I'd also recommend James Galvin's \\"Fencing the Sky,\\" which tells a similar story about a cowboy pursued across a Western landscape by the law.t a mythic cowboy's adventure and the lives it disrupts. <br /> <br />As a companion volume, I'd also recommend James Galvin's \\"Fencing the Sky,\\" which tells a similar story about a cowboy pursued across a Western landscape by the law.  <br />	2004-08-09

McMurtry, in this collection of essays about Texas, says he prefers fiction to nonfiction, for various reasons, but I for one find these ambivalent ruminations on his home state more enjoyable than some of his fiction. The insights come fast and furious in this short book, by comparison with a slow-moving novel like \\"Moving On,\\" written about this same time, where a few ideas are stretched thin across several hundred pages.<br /><br />Published in 1968, the content of \\"Narrow Grave\\" will seem dated to some readers. Written in the shadow of the assassination in Dallas and while another Texan was in the White House, the essays capture Texas in a period of rough transition from its rural past to its globalized present (the rise and fall of Enron would certainly have been featured in a current version of this book).<br /><br />Much of it is timeless, however. It includes one of my favorite McMurtry essays, \\"Take My Saddle From the Wall: A Valediction,\\" in which he provides a history of the McMurtry family, who settled in the 1880s on 320 acres west of Wichita Falls and in the following generation relocated to the Panhandle to live mostly as cowboys and ranchers. In this essay, McMurtry separates the mythic cowboy from the actual one and describes how cowboys are probably the biggest believers in the myths about them. It's full of ironies, colorful personalities, and wonderful details.<br /><br />Altogether, the book attempts to present an unsentimental portrait of a state that also tends to get carried away by its own myths. The result is often a jaundiced view and gets to sounding like the worst Paul Theroux travel writing, where it seems like the writer has a personal grudge against the place he's describing. A car trip from Brownsville to the Panhandle is great fun for the wealth of local color captured along the way, but McMurtry focuses on every unhappy and unfortunate detail as if to warn the reader away from ever doing the same. The description of a fiddlers contest in East Texas is downright unkind.<br /><br />It's easy to see, however, that it's a lover's quarrel McMurtry has with Texas. I gladly recommend this entertaining book to readers curious about the Lone Star State and the man who wrote \\"The Last Picture Show\\" and \\"Lonesome Dove\\"lers contest in East Texas is downright unkind. <br /> <br />It's easy to see, however, that it's a lover's quarrel McMurtry has with Texas.

Kelton's novel has some of the ingredients of pulp western fiction - big ranchers against the little guys, justice at the end of a rope, an honorable hero wearing a sheriff's badge  - but he brings a great deal of insight, experience, and historical background to the task of telling this story. It is enjoyable and full of well-drawn characters and unexpected turns of plot from beginning (a squabble over the brand on a cow) to the end (a gripping courtroom drama).<br /><br />The title suggests that the book might be a more light-hearted story that focuses on the cowboy strike of 1883, but Kelton's aim is to explore the more complex psychology of the men who live by the Code of the West. The ill-fated strike is over before we are well into the book, and the author focuses on the unexpected and far-reaching results of its aftermath. Like many books about the West, this one is about loss and the passing of an era. The cowboy way of the open rangeland is quickly disappearing as settlers move in and towns spring up, the cattle business falls under the influence of venture capital from the East, and rough justice must give way to law and order.<br /><br />Most enjoyable for this reader is the characterization of its main character, Hitch, a single cowboy in his thirties for whom circumstance, loyalty, and honor lead him out of a job he loves and into harm's way, until he reluctantly assumes a role of no small responsibility and risk in the new social order on the Texas plains. Not the fearless hero of standard cowboy fiction, Hitch has a good many conflicting feelings,he's more diplomatic than quick with a gun, and his actions require considerable courage.<br /><br />Kelton's rural Texas background and knowledge of frontier history clearly come through in the many details that enrich the tale he tells. He notes a horse's dislike for flapping laundry on a clothesline. The cowboys drink more strong coffee than whiskey. He realistically describes a man's slow, painful recovery from being pistol-whipped. A man angrily observes the terror of a cowboy who wet his britches as he was being hanged for thievery. And there is much about managing cattle on the open range and the complicated, neverending process of ensuring their ownership.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the historical West, cowboys, roundups and branding, frontier social history, the landscape of the plains, frontier justice, the Code of the West, and the struggle for political power and shifting alliances in changing times. Kelton's book is well-written, with memorable characters, and a fair share of suspense.l recovery from being pistol-whipped.

There is a melancholy and nostalgia, as if the story were told by someone twice his age. In its leisurely and intense unfolding of time, place, mood and character, it brings to mind Thomas Wolfe's &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; and Tennessee Williams' &quot;The Glass Menagerie.&quot;<br /><br /> Modern-day readers will find themselves making a big adjustment to the pace of this long novel. Its central story could be told in 250 pages: a sensitive boy grows up in a modest family in Reno, Nevada, befriends a girl who lives near him and a boy and girl whose parents are wealthy and live across town, falls deeply in love with one of the girls while in high school, and begins a career as a composer and musician, eventually marrying and finding himself as an artist. But Clark has much more to tell, immersing the reader in richly detailed incidents that can expand into 20 and 30 pages - a horse race, a high school party, a tennis match, a climb up a mountain, a gathering of locals at a bar.<br /><br /> While the story takes place in the 1920s and 30s, there are only passing references to historical events and period detail. Much of the story is internal, psychological, emotional. And much of the story has to do with the timelessness of place and the cycle of seasons. There is a celebration of the city of Reno (as a hometown, not a destination for gambling and easy divorce), its trees, the surrounding mountains, and nearby Pyramid Lake and Lake Tahoe. Emotions and landscape are intricately interwoven. Clark's descriptions of places are infused with moods that shift and change like passing cloud shadows.<br /><br /> And finally, it's a story of the difficulties of becoming an artist, finding one's own voice and vision, developing one's talent, the personal costs and the struggle against discouragement and compromise, the social isolation and the impact on personal relationships. Part of Clark's achievement in this novel is the ability to take the reader with only words into the mind of a musician and composer. I recommend reading this book with an open map of Reno and western Nevada, and look online for pictures of Pyramid Lake and Lake Tahoe. Both will enrich the experience of this fine novel.ial isolation and the impact on personal relationships.

The author's list of acknowledgements fills a page at the opening of this historical account of prostitution in the early West. She has clearly done her research. And her book is a window into a subject often alluded to in the literature of the frontier but seldom if ever revealed in any depth.<br />The West was a man's world where, according to Seagrave, men often outnumbered women 50 to 1. Employment opportunities being few for uneducated young women, a great many found their way to the brothels in the red light districts of cities, cow towns and mining camps. The author describes these establishments from the most genteel down to the most squalid. She also characterizes the role of the madam, an entrepreneur whose business contributed to the local economy while being at the same time illegal and an object of outrage among the community's socially respectable.<br />Much of the book is devoted to profiles of individual madams, often known for their sharp business sense and their generosity, while contributing freely to local charitable organizations. The book includes many period photographs, including studio portraits of well established madams and the women who worked for them. One chapter is devoted to the special plight of Chinese prostitutes who lived under conditions of slavery in Western states into the early 20th century.<br />While the book is informative, a reader may sometimes question its accuracy as history. Myth and legend have a way of mingling with documented fact, and while all of this is interesting, the author isn't scrupulous about distinguishing between them. Because the book tends to dramatize the lives of the women it discusses, a reader looking for an analysis of prostitution in the larger picture of Western social history will probably find a lot of questions unanswered. Still, the book opens up a subject that is too seldom regarded with the historical interest it deserves.	2004-07-14

I've read much more of Larry McMurtry's fiction than his nonfiction, and sometimes I find myself enjoying his nonfiction a great deal more. His wry, humorous point of view, gift for quiet irony, and depth of thought come across so much more strongly in his own voice, compared to those of the characters in his novels. And while I am very fond of &quot;Leaving Cheyenne,&quot; &quot;Horseman, Pass By&quot; and &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; my favorite McMurtry novels, it is an equal pleasure to be in the presence of the man himself, as he reveals himself in the essays in this book.<br /><br /> Writing in his 62nd year, McMurtry lets himself free associate across a number of subjects; his life as a compulsive reader and book collector; the brief span of West Texas frontier history where three generations of McMurtrys lived, worked, and multiplied; the realities and myths of cowboys and ranching; his education at Rice in Houston; a short story writing course at Stanford with Frank O'Connor; his life as a novelist; the making of the movie &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;; the passing of the urban secondhand bookstores; the emergence of Dairy Queens as social centers in small towns; the Archer City, Texas, centennial celebration; the demise of storytelling; the fragmentation of the American family; the importance of Proust and Virginia Woolf at a critical point in his life; the winning of the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;; and - most remarkably - his descent into a fierce depression following heart surgery in his 50s, from which he has not completely recovered at the time he was writing this book.<br /><br /> There is a deep melancholy in many McMurtry novels, played sometimes for laughs, as in &quot;Texasville&quot; (where characters hang out at the Dairy Queen). Indirectly, he accounts for some of that in this book, turning as he sometimes does to the themes of loss and the impermanence of things - represented in so many ways, from the vast outpouring of books that sit in piles and on shelves, collect dust and will never be opened again, to the death of his father, a rancher who worked hard all his life and saw in his last years that his achievements were far too few.<br /><br /> I recommend this book to anyone who's read McMurtry's novels and has wondered about the man whose imagination has produced so many memorable characters and stories. For the fun of it, you might just take it down to the Dairy Queen and read it there over a MooLatte.t sit in piles and on shelves, collect dust and will never be opened again, to the death of his father, a rancher who worked hard all his life and saw in his last years that his achievements were far too few.

The setting is ranch country in the far northeast corner of New Mexico, and the time is the 1950s. The story is told by Frank Dalton, a half-breed from Oklahoma, with the name of a famous outlaw. There are numerous plot threads, most of which can be found in other cowboy novels - including the saving of a ranch, a bitter father-son relationship, and the education of a young cowboy into the ways of &quot;the calling,&quot; or cowboying. There's also some Southwest history, dating back to Spanish colonial settlement. There are mysteries to solve. And there is not one but two love stories.<br />The romance of Frank and Roberta is an unusual storyline for cowboy fiction, where women rarely intrude into the all-male world of working cattle. The two characters fall in love and into bed without much complication, and Hyson describes the intensity of their love affair without embarrassment. For once, an author has written about a cowboy who doesn't reserve all his affection for his horse.<br />While the various threads of plot hold the story together over the length of its many pages, what may interest readers more are the factual descriptions of ranch work, like the process of feeding cattle in the winter, the breaking of a horse, working a deal with a cattle buyer, and the way a team of men goes about branding calves. A section describing how a rodeo comes to town, the lives of rodeo cowboys, and the author's inside tips on bull riding make the novel come to life with a vividness and immediacy that do not come so easily on other pages. Also contributing to the realism is a surprising candor in the cowboy talk, often bawdy and humorously coarse.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in cowboys, ranching, and the Southwest. Readers will also enjoy MacKey Hedges' novel, &quot;The Last Buckaroo.&quot;	2004-07-10

This is a fine collection of 86 black-and-white photographs taken by photographer Joanne Berghold at small town rodeos around Montana in the 1990s and early 2000s. Unlike the commercialized rodeo to be seen in today's PRCA circuit, these local rodeos capture the spirit of the sport as it emerged in the early 20th century -- a family-oriented affair that brought the whole rural community together for a once-a-year celebration. Look at these pictures, and what you often see instead of covered bleachers and flashy corporate sponsor billboards is a wire arena fence with trucks and cars pulled up to it and open prairie or hills beyond. The parking lot is grass-covered, and horse trailers are parked under the trees.<br />The opening images set the tone of the book -- gravel roads with grass and weeds right to the edges, leading to a low horizon, where clouds drift in a big sky, a veil of rain falling into a distant mountain ridge. Then in the photographs that follow there's the contrasting activity of small town life, strung out along a treeless main street, and the gathering of people at the rodeo grounds.<br />A cowboy in black hat, wranglers and spurs checks out the draw for the events posted on the side of a trailer, a young girl practices roping a hay bale, hats are placed over hearts in the grandstands and in the crow's nest for the Pledge of Allegiance, horses in the dusty light move into a holding pen, a cowboy bows his head in prayer on the top rail of a chute over a saddled bronc, riders one after another take spills off bucking rough stock. The arena itself may be dusty dirt or waterlogged mud. A roper waits, eyes set in concentration, a piggin string clamped in his mouth under a full mustache; a young bulldogger skids boots first in the dirt, his arms locked around the horns of a calf. There are team ropers, barrel racers, young bull riders taping up, and bullfighters in clown makeup. In the end, buckles are awarded to the winners, cowboys head out with war bags over their shoulders, and horses move up loading chutes into a trailer.<br />The book is a tribute to a western tradition and way of life, still close to its roots in the workaday world of ranchers and cowboys. It includes an essay by Kim Zupan, a gifted writer and former rough-stock rider. All photos were taken in Montana in rural small towns like Boulder, Belt, Wilsall, and Roundup.bags over their shoulders, and horses move up loading chutes into a trailer.<br />The book is a tribute to a western tradition and way of life, still close to its roots in the workaday world of ranchers and cowboys.

US	51205644	RG1GUY98WPQI0	0140291881	467470156	The Weight of Dreams	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Sandhills noir. . .	This book had me staying up more than a couple nights way past my bedtime, unable to put it down. It's really several books wrapped into one. On different levels it is a crime fiction story leading to a courtroom drama, a bitter family melodrama, an unsettling look into the shady side of horse shows, a detailed account of cattle ranching through a storm-driven winter, a tale of guilt and personal salvation, a passionate and sensual love story, a travelogue portraying the stark beauty of the Nebraska Sandhills, an examination of race relations (white and Native American), and a story of hanging onto a family ranch on the edge of bankruptcy.<br />The author sustains all these threads by interconnecting them with considerable suspense and tension. It's like film noir - dark, brooding, always on the verge of violence or mischance. And under that interplay of tensions is a moral vision that seems often at the point of being lost completely.<br />Agee populates her novel with a large cast of characters, using shifting points of view to explore their unfolding relationships and internal lives. With the focus of a short-story writer, she introduces and opens up incidents that seem to bring the narrative almost to a stop, while we wait to learn how these scenes take their place in the larger picture embracing all of them. While some readers may find the pace of the novel somewhat slow because of this, I was fascinated by the richness of detail and would have been happy for even more, especially exploring the resolution of the central conflict of the narrative - between its protagonist, Ty Bonte, and his nemesis, Harney Rivers.<br />I'm happy to recommend this book. Like other reviewers familiar with the terrain and seasons of the Nebraska Sandhills, I was pleased to see this rolling region of the Great Plains and its people represented so faithfully and in an engaging story told by a gifted writer.	2004-07-06

This is one of the best books I've ever read describing the day-to-day, real-life work of cowboys. There is something of a story to follow in this novel, but once you get past the fairly far-fetched antics at the beginning, you're treated to an informative description of what it's like moving from one ranch job to the next -- each time getting used to a new boss, a new bunch of cowboys and horses, and the conditions of various kinds of ranch operations and cow camps in various seasons of the year. There are a few digressions, as Tap the narrator in his sixties recalls adventures from earlier times. Mostly it's the absorbing accounts of working cowboys who seem completely real, like they could walk right off the page.<br />The novel is set in the Great Basin of the West, so the lingo, the gear and the cowboy way are all buckaroo-style, harking back to the vaqueros from old California. The terrain is mostly Nevada and Oregon. In northern California the two heroes take jobs packing dudes into the mountains. Later they settle down for a while working in a huge feedlot operation. There's also a side trip to Arizona, where our boys fetch up with an outfit of Apache Indians, and the author explores in fascinating detail the uneasy relationship between white cowboys and their Native American counterparts.<br />It's also a story of friendship, as old-timer Tap acquires a young, greenhorn sidekick, Dean, who knows kickboxing but not much about what it takes to be a cowboy. Over the seasons and years, the boy learns a great deal, giving the reader a chance to learn some things along with him. The author captures the romance of cowboying without denying the discomforts, the dangers and risk of accident and injury, and the potential for conflict between men who don't get along. The novel is punctuated with several violent fights, and there are two or three accounts of accidents sending cowboys to hospital emergency rooms.<br />This book was a great pleasure to read. I'm happy to recommend it to anyone with an interest in cowboying, ranching, and the West.o recommend it to anyone with an interest in cowboying, ranching, and the West.	2004-06-30

The reference in the title is to the dedication of the author's father, a celebrity rodeo announcer, who never missed a day's work because of the weather. It's also a shorthand reference to the old song &quot;I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you. . .&quot; Her book is not only a tribute to her famous father but an account of a difficult father-daughter relationship that soured from worshipful love to bitterness and eventually to a kind of grudging respect in his last years before dying in 1980.<br />The book is also a family memoir, characterizing the lives of those awkwardly related to her by blood or marriage: the author's mother and stepfather, an older aunt and her husband, and her father's second wife. Each of them is as vividly drawn as the larger-than-life Western luminary at the center of the story - Cy Taillon, whose golden voice and gentlemanly manner won the devotion of rodeo cowboys and fans from San Francisco's Cow Palace to Madison Square Garden from the 1940s to the 1970s.<br />Not surprisingly, what the author's story reveals casts her father in a somewhat different light, first as the hard drinking, gambling, womanizing ne'er-do-well who married the author's singer-dancer mother after a one-day courtship. Following the rodeo circuit out of a home base in Montana, they fought and loved each other passionately, a Scott and Zelda of the Western plains, and then broke up. Following a spectacular crash at an air show in Great Falls in 1946, at which Cy used the microphone to calm the startled crowd, he became the hero he was destined to become. Assuming a life of rectitude with a new devoted wife and two new sons, he was finally launched in the career rodeo people will always remember him for. Meanwhile, his first wife languished in a miserable second marriage, and his daughter grew up, loving her absent father deeply while stubbornly unwilling to come to terms with the man he had become.<br />Thanks to the University of Nebraska Press for reprinting this wonderful memoir. It offers a fascinating window into the world of the rodeo circuit, at least as it once was. For rodeo-going readers, it does much to explain the evolution of the role and persona of the rodeo announcer and the elevation of rodeo cowboying into a kind of gallantry. It's also an entertaining story told by an author with a gift for both sentiment and satire. With her eye for the absurd detail, she can unerringly find the irony in an often rueful story.

The full significance of this novel's evocative title does not become clear until the very closing pages, and that's fitting for a melodrama-historical-romance that holds its cards very close to the chest right up to each turn of the plot. There are in fact several narratives and themes that weave in and around each other, and Doig is careful to balance them artfully so that each new development has an element of the unexpected for the reader.<br />The texture of Doig's narrative style is richly detailed, like tapestry. His characters and the exchanges between them spring strongly to life. You do not speed read for the plot but linger over the nuances of behavior, gesture, verbal inflection, thought, and feeling. Meanwhile, a compelling story is told of a black ranch hand and rodeo clown who is transformed under the guiding hand of a white voice teacher to become a rising star in the music world.<br />Set in the 1920s, the story also portrays the social forces and prejudices that intrude on their growing relationship. And the reader learns how the KKK reached as far west as Montana with its use of secrecy and intimidation to enforce a code of racial and ethnic discrimination. Just as ugly, though not resorting to hoods and sheets, are those at the very highest social rungs who have their part to play in enforcing racial divisions.<br />Set primarily in Montana, the book needs to look back only a generation to the immigrant homesteaders of the 1880s, the cavalry posts on the plains, the rise of the cattle barons, and the subduing of the Native Americans. Meanwhile, the trenches of WWI inhabit recent memory. The book captures the breadth of American life from the closing frontier on the one hand to jazz-age New York and the Harlem Renaissance on the other.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in the historical West, relationships between strongly independent characters, the African-American experience, singing and voice training, and a richly textured, multi-layered style of storytelling.

Thirty years have passed since Duane Moore and Sonny Crawford graduated from high school in Thalia, Texas. The events of &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; are a distant memory to everyone except Sonny, who continues to live in the past and occasionally gets lost there. Duane has married, gotten rich in the oil boom, raised a bunch of kids, built a 12,000-square-foot house outside of town, and is now $12 million in debt. The boom is over, and disappointment, the dominant mood of the characters in McMurtry's earlier book, is settling in again.<br />This time, however, disappointment and depression are mostly played for laughs. Sonny, the poignant central character in &quot;Picture Show,&quot; has been sidelined in this story by Duane's domestic conflicts, his efforts to remain optimistic in the face of bankruptcy, and his affair with a married woman who is also carrying on with Duane's dope-dealing, womanizing son. McMurtry plays up the ironies and absurdities of life in Thalia where, as Duane observes, everyone seems to have gone crazy. The married and unmarried swap partners with the free-for-all abandon of romance as it's portrayed in country and western songs. And a kind of lunacy grips others, whose adventures push the narrative into wildly implausible episodes of farce, such as a mammoth egg-throwing fight on the closing night of Thalia's centennial celebration.<br />The melancholy mood that dominates &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; makes only a brief appearance in this much longer novel, as Duane remembers a young employee killed in Vietnam. And readers, like me, who are fans of McMurtry's earlier work, will be disappointed that McMurtry treats the sorrows of his characters this time so lightly. At worst, the behavior of the town's residents gives Duane headaches and he comes to a realization that his &quot;success&quot; as an oilman and a respected citizen is not an achievement that gives him much self-esteem. The liberated 1980s women in his life (wife Karla, mistress Suzy, and old high school sweetheart Jacy) constantly remind him that he's less than adequate as a man. And at 48, he understands that he no longer has the energy he once had.<br />Meanwhile, there are pleasures to be had in the novel. In particular, I enjoyed the endless varieties of ironic and humorous disputes that characterize the verbal exchanges between the characters. Duane has a comic ruefulness that both protects him and reveals his vulnerability.

Eustace Conway, the back-to-nature mountain man of the title, is someone you can see as a living American myth or a nut case. The author's portrait of him, full of ironies right from the title onward, lends itself to either point of view. And depending on how the book is read, you can see either admiration or skepticism in what she says about Conway.<br />Or you can see subject and author in all of these ways which, as I understand the book, is what the author intends. Eustace Conway is full of contradictions. He's both immensely appealing and stridently off-putting. A rigorous thinker, naturalist, and walking whole-earth-catalog, he is still a babe in the woods in knowing how to negotiate just about any kind of relationship with another human being - including the many, many young women he attracts. By the author's account, few men so lucky in bed have been so unlucky in love.<br />For every amateur psychologist the author provides more than enough back-story to puzzle over Conway's behavior. There's a tyrant father who heaps withering scorn on his son, starting at the age of two. And there's his great-outdoors-loving mother, who rescues him from his father by encouraging his unsupervised forays into the woods. By the time he is out of high school, he's already living in a teepee, beading his own moccasins, killing game for food, skinning animals, and hiking the entire Appalachian Trail wearing nothing more than two bandanas, weather permitting.<br />Meanwhile, his epic journeys on foot and on horseback and his pioneering in the North Carolina backcountry are mythic Americana. While our first reaction to all this may be admiration, Gilbert writes in a wisecracking tone that heightens the ironies and more than once made me laugh out loud. And she reminds us that if there's anyone to fault, it's not Conway but the gullibly romantic Americans who believe literally in their own national mythology and heroes. Looking back to Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett, for instance, she reveals that they were in fact no different. Like Conway, they were supporters of the myths and legends that grew up around them and good old-fashioned American entrepreneurs and self-promoters.<br />Anyway, there's much to enjoy in this book. And it's full of surprises - right up to the last pages, as Gilbert tells a poignant story of how Conway touched the life of a troubled teenager who spent a week with him in the woods building a fence. And the author's closing image captures the spirit of the entire book - Conway getting out of his truck and shouting, &quot;I love you!&quot; at a buck deer that refuses to move off the road. The image is moving, ridiculous, or both; take your pick.ythology and heroes. Looking back to Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett, for instance, she reveals that they were in fact no different.

And the author's closing image captures the spirit of the entire book - Conway getting out of his truck and shouting, &quot;I love you!&quot; at a buck deer that refuses to move off the road. The image is moving, ridiculous, or both; take your pick.	2004-06-12

There's a scene in a 1970s movie in which Gene Hackman tries to grind up a broken wine glass in a garbage disposal. Reading this book is a lot like that.<br />I picked up &quot;My Losing Season&quot; not as a great fan of Pat Conroy or as a former athlete. I was attracted more by the theme of loss and its lessons. And I expected a different personal story than the one Conroy tells. The losing basketball season in his last year as a cadet at The Citadel in Charleston, SC, is a pretext for a much deeper theme - survival in the face of humiliation.<br />And it's not the losses of the games that are humiliating. On the one hand is the brutal and unrelenting contempt of his marine colonel father, a child abuser and wife beater. On the other hand is the withering scorn of Conroy's arbitrary and capricious coach, Mel Thompson. Both, in Conroy's account, do their best to beat the spirit out of the boy who has grown into an indomitable (though undersized and modestly talented) point guard for his team. And all of this takes place in the regimented, fierce, all-male environment of The Citadel in the 1960s, where incoming boys are routinely broken by the merciless hazing of their upperclassmen.<br />Humiliation is a much more difficult subject than loss to deal with. Loss leaves scars, but humiliation remains an open wound, and in writing about it there is the risk of slipping into the tug of war between self-pity and self-blame. Conroy takes us there sometimes, and those are the parts of his story that are lacerating. But win or lose, the ups and downs of the season are fascinating and the accounts of the games are thrilling. As a writer, he has a gift for hustling the reader with suspense and drama and sudden shifts of mood. As an observer of character, he vividly brings to life the individual boys who make up the team. As someone deeply wounded, he is able to freely and convincingly express the many articulations of the heart - especially love, admiration, and gratitude.<br />Once I started into this book, I could not put it down. It kept me reading late into the night. And when I wasn't reading, it filled my thoughts, as I'm sure it will for a long time. It's a troubling book that wants to resolve a host of dark memories. And it may well want to show the reader how to do the same. I'm not sure that it's completely successful in either regard. And maybe that's the point. It's enough to recast humiliation as loss. That is a wound that can eventually heal.r />Once I started into this book, I could not put it down. It kept me reading late into the night.

This is a classic work of Texas fiction that is memorable for the storm of controversy it caused when it was published anonymously in 1925. Set in the 1880s, it tells the story of a fragile 18-year-old girl from Virginia, suddenly orphaned and left penniless, who goes to live with her cousin, a rancher somewhere west of Sweetwater, in West Texas. Dreamily romantic and totally unprepared for the rigors of life on the plains, she struggles unsuccessfully with deprivations of body, mind, and spirit that only the toughest frontier settlers are fit to confront.<br />It's her misfortune to arrive in the middle of a terrible drought that parches the treeless land and under the relentless wind turns it into a churning dustbowl. As for many who first settled on the plains, it is the constant wind that is her undoing. Under its maddening influence, her life takes one devastating turn after another, until the story ends in a melodramatic climax.<br />A reader today may find the melodrama somewhat over the top. A film was made of the story, starring Lillian Gish, and one can easily imagine the sorts of silent movie histrionics used to represent the critical scenes in the story. However, there are pleasures of another kind to be had in the novel, specifically the characters of two enjoyably drawn cowboys, Lige and Sourdough, who both fall in love with the young heroine. Their competition for her affection and their colorful use of the English language brighten these pages considerably.<br />The author grew up in West Texas, and there's a great deal of the authentic in her writing. The humor and the indomitable fortitude of her frontier characters seem based on observation of the real thing. She's clearly writing from firsthand experience when she describes the landscape, the weather, and the grinding demoralization of year after year of drought. And she captures in detail the impact of sun, sand and wind on the physical appearance of both men and women. It's an anti-romantic vision that Larry McMurtry revived 35 years later in his early novels of ranch life, &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; and &quot;Horseman, Pass By.&quot;<br />This book is currently out of print, but a copy of it surely belongs on any bookshelf dedicated to the literature of the American West.sion that Larry McMurtry revived 35 years later in his early novels of ranch life, &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; and &quot;Horseman, Pass By.&quot;<br />This book is currently out of print, but a copy of it surely belongs on any bookshelf dedicated to the literature of the American West.	2004-06-06

And if you know the movie, you have a really good idea of the characters, setting and storyline of McMurtry's novel. Like the movie, the novel itself is in black and white. A handful of likable characters are surrounded by small-town ignorance and trapped by circumstance or their own limited understanding of the world. Meanwhile, much of the story takes place in the bitter cold, colorless months of north Texas winter.<br />A year passes, from one football season to the next, and during those twelve months, the central characters, Sonny and Duane, graduate from high school and have a number of adventures, as much as two single young men can have in a small rural community. Duane is obsessed with Jacy, the richest, prettiest girl in school. Sonny, who has the more tender heart, befriends the coach's 40-year-old wife, Ruth. And their story is a sweet contrast to the generally coarse, unfeeling or blighted relationships among the rest of those in the town. Of the very few in town who seem to feel something like full-hearted love, McMurtry only gives us glimpses and dwells instead on what is to be lamented in the rest of his characters' unlived lives.<br />Like the R-rated movie, this is an R-rated book, with somewhat more graphic detail. Meanwhile, the inner lives of his characters, as McMurtry reveals them, give the reader a great deal more of their shifting moods, ironies and nuances of attitude and emotion. With Sonny as the most central character in the novel, you get a much deeper and more sympathetic portrayal of him. And finally the book is worth reading for the scenes that did not make it into the movie.<br />Like his two earlier books, &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; and &quot;Horseman, Pass By,&quot; this is a finely imagined novel, with strong, memorable characters, and a mood that ranges between the farcical and the profoundly sad. I'm happy to recommend all three.	2004-06-04

At the age of 28, when he wrote his memoir, Charles Siringo had already been a cowboy for 15 years. Born in 1855 on the Gulf Coast of Texas, Siringo worked in one job after another across the Midwest and Southwest, ranging from St. Louis to New Mexico. Still a teenager, he settled on cowboying at the time of the great cattle drives and was apparently very good at it, though no luckier than most at making a living from it. He worked for many years for the LX ranch in the Texas Panhandle, for a while rounding up cattle that had drifted away or were stolen. This occupation put him in New Mexico at the time of Billy the Kid, who was four years his junior. He never met Billy but knew men who did, and his imagination seems to have been fired by the stories they told about the pursuit and eventual shooting of this young outlaw. Though by his own account Siringo never shot a man himself, he was a dead aim with a six-shooter.<br />His memoir was written, as he admits in his preface, to make money &quot;and lots of it.&quot; It's not great literature, beginning with his earliest childhood memories and recounting the events of his life with no particular sense of compelling storytelling. It's just one darn thing after another. But a reader with some patience will be rewarded in the latter part of the book as his adventures begin adding up to something like a real narrative - working for the LX as a range detective - and he begins emerging as more of a coherent protagonist in his own story.<br />And it's not all about the work of cowboying, herding and rounding up cattle, and taking them to market. There are some close scrapes and some fearless derring-do. And there are also matters of the heart, as the young cowboy falls in love with a string of sweethearts he meets along the way, finally marrying one he meets in Kansas and ending his career as a cowboy. I'm happy to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Wild West, cowboys, ranching in the days of the open ranges, and social history of the late 19th century.

Larry McMurtry grew up among ranchers and cowboys, and his familiarity with this rural world makes his early novels set in and around Thalia, Texas, genuinely alive with rich detail and believable characters. He knows this world as it's seen and understood by the people who live there, both young and old. Most revealingly (and colorfully) he knows how they really talk to each other and to themselves -- not in the stereotypical ways often ascribed to country people.<br />You read &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; slowly (the reference is to an old cowboy ballad, not the town in Wyoming), savoring the re-creation of real times and places, even when the story itself may move with no great urgency. The insights into characters and the observance of their behavior make them come alive on the page, and you simply enjoy the portrayals of them, their values, beliefs, and experiences.<br />Part I of this novel is told from the point of view of Gideon, a rancher's son, about 20 years old, around the year 1920. There is his friend Johnny, from a neighboring ranch, and the two of them compete for the affection of Molly, a barefoot, independent-minded girl who willfully and unwisely marries another boy, an oilfield roustabout.<br />In Part II, it is 20 years later, during WWII, and Molly, now widowed, remains friends with the middle-aged Gideon and Johnny, each of whom happens to have fathered one of her two sons. This part is told from her point of view. Gideon has married another woman (also unwisely) and has become a prosperous rancher, while Johnny works for him, content to be a happy-go-lucky cowboy. Molly lives alone, her sons off to war, and yearns for the company of each of her two old friends and lovers.<br />In Part III, it is again 20 years later, about 1960 (the novel was published in 1962), and the three characters are now much older. Told from the point of view of Johnny, this section is farcically comical. Meanwhile, Gideon is haunted with guilt for his infidelities with Molly, and Johnny, as he says, has never lost a night's sleep feeling shame for anything he's ever done.<br />Written in 20-year jumps, the novel gives a sense of how quickly life passes and how people remain the adolescents they once were even as they age. We see that choices made in haste cannot be undone and can leave a life-long legacy of regret. Yet there is also solace in affection, loyalty, and tenderness of heart. The novel celebrates the special quality of friendship among friends who have lived their whole lives together in the same small rural community. And over the years, there is the land -- and working the land -- to ground their rural lives with purpose.<br />I recommend this novel, along with the author's &quot;Horseman, Pass By,&quot; to anyone with an interest in cowboys and ranching.

This was Larry McMurtry's first novel, published in 1961, long before &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot; It's also his first of several books set in and around the small Texas town of Thalia. The story was quickly transformed into a Paul Newman film &quot;Hud&quot; in 1963, which is the version of the story most people know. In spirit, the two stories are similar - they are both anti-westerns, in which code of the West is subverted and corrupted by failure of moral character.<br />But McMurtry's novel tells a story with a darker vision. At the center is Lonnie, the teenager growing up on his grandfather's ranch, and it's through his eyes that we see the cold, self-serving indifference of his uncle Hud. Still a boy, unschooled in much of anything besides the dawn-to-dusk labor of ranch work, Lonnie is no moral center, following his grandfather's example. In many ways, he accepts Hud's violent behavior, his disrespect for the old man, and his ruthless use of women as a kind of norm. In the end, as he leaves the ranch, he takes the first steps toward a life that may well be no more rewarding or purposeful than that of the regretful hired hand Jesse, who gets too drunk to ride his cutting horse in the rodeo.<br />To streamline the story, the film has scaled back or eliminated interesting key characters like Jesse, another ranch hand Lonzo, a neighbor Hank, and a friend Hermy, who is badly injured trying to ride a bull. Also, by casting a white woman in the role of the black cook Halmea (Patricia Neal's Alma), the film sidesteps a racial dimension that the novel brings to the story.<br />So for readers who know and like the film, this is a very different telling of the story and well worth reading. As usual in McMurtry's early novels, there is a richly detailed capturing of character, speech, and setting. He knows these people inside and out, how they think, talk, and behave. He also totally deromanticizes ranch work, representing it as mercilessly hot, dusty, and exhausting. The small-town rodeo, with its drinking, womanizing cowboys, fares little better. I heartily recommend this novel for anyone interested in the rural West and ranching, along with McMurtry's more melancholy but less bleak &quot;Leaving Cheyenne.&quot;he small-town rodeo, with its drinking, womanizing cowboys, fares little better.

With 142 separate readings in this 500+ page book, Hillerman's anthology of Western writing makes a great bedside reader for anyone with an interest in the frontier West as it was lived by a vast variety of people. Not surprisingly, this writer of great crime fiction set on the Navajo reservation of New Mexico and Arizona devotes many of the first 100 pages to the \\"first Westerners,\\" Native Americans, and the Hispanic history of the Southwest. The rest of the book has sections on settlers, cowboys, mining, the military, and the law and outlaws. Additional sections represent women, tall tales and practical jokes, travel, language, and \\"characters.\\" The book closes with a fiction section of short stories and excerpts from novels.<br />As you might expect in a book called \\"The Best of the West,\\" there are writings by Edward Abbey, Wallace Stegner, Owen Wister, N. Scott Momaday, J. Frank Dobie, Meriwether Lewis, and Helen Hunt Jackson. The great surprise of the book, if you're familiar with Western literature, is the many readings from sources you're likely not to have heard of before. There are absorbing vignettes drawn from period newspapers, journals, memoirs, letters and other little-known publications.<br />Some of my favorites include a far-fetched autobiographical sketch by Calamity Jane, an account of a \\"love scrape\\" in Las Cruces by cowboy writer Charlie Siringo, Eugene Manlove Rhodes' description of loading up a chuck wagon, Raphael Pumpelly's report of the discomforts of travel by overland stage, H. M. Chittenden's account of the amazing bad luck of a man who survived a series of near-death mishaps on a visit to Yellowstone country in 1877, James Rusling's description of traveling down the Columbia River by steamboat and train, Alexander Majors' informative account of the short, perilous history of the pony express, a description of young J. C. Penney's first day of business in Kemmerer, Wyoming, and a selection on sod houses from social historian Everett Dick.<br />Excerpts from novels are mixed in with the historical accounts. I especially liked John Steinbeck's rhapsodic description of Highway 66 from \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" a breathless homage to the title character of Owen Wister's \\"The Virginian,\\" a description of the Colorado mining town, Leadville, from Wallace Stegner's Pulitzer Prize winning \\"Angle of Repose,\\" Dorothy Scarborough's grim account of West Texas wind, in her novel \\"The Wind,\\" and a description of driving down an early paved road in California from Upton Sinclair's \\"Oil!\\" And there are complete short stories: Stephen Crane's \\"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky,\\" capturing the impact that a young bride has on the rough world of frontier men, and Bret Harte's \\"The Outcasts of Poker Flat,\\" set in 1850 California and giving the reader a more melodramatic rendering of a the same theme -- the taming influence of a young woman's innocence.<br />I'm happy to recommend this enjoyable anthology to anyone with an interest in the social history of the American West.

The quality of page design, richness of images (photos new and old, paintings by western artists, maps, posters), and the rich detail and freshness of the text make this a book that's a feast for the eye and the curious mind with every turn of the page.<br />As just one example, the chapter on cowboys and the open range includes reproductions of paintings by Charles Russell, Frederic Remington, and other western artists (including a two-page spread of Russell's dramatic &quot;Smoke of a .45&quot;); a page-long quote from &quot;Teddy Blue&quot; Abbot's &quot;We Pointed Them North&quot;; a map of the cattle drive trails and railroad lines; vintage photographs of cowboys on the trail, roping and branding cattle, breaking horses, as well as studio portraits of cowboys; two-page illustrated essays on Dodge City and its peace keepers, the Colt Revolver, the Stetson hat, Black cowboys, and vigilantes; and full-page color photographs of rolling grassland in the Black Hills, the high deserts east of the Southwest, and cattle under a big sky with snow covered mountains in the distance.<br />Stegner's book is both political and social history, and it captures both the triumphs and losses that represent the &quot;winning&quot; of the West, including the wars declared and undeclared against the Native American tribes. The strongest image in this regard is a vintage photograph of the mass burials at Wounded Knee in 1890. His book is also an album of brilliantly photographed color images of the western landscape -- plains, mountains, lakes, deserts, in all seasons. You understand that these breathtaking spaces are as much a part of the Western experience as the stories of the people who traversed and settled in them.<br />The nearly square format of the book gives the pages room to breathe, allowing the book to absorb a vast amount of textual and visual materials. Stegner's text is richly interlaced with quotations from 19th-century contemporaries and established historians. The credits pages are a distinguished list of sources including the Amon Carter Museum of Fort Worth, Texas; the Buffalo Bill Cody Historical Center in Cody, Wyoming; Harper's Weekly; and the Joslyn Art Museum of Omaha, Nebraska. There's an excellent bibliography of over 60 books about the West, from &quot;Teddy Blue&quot; Abbot's and Andy Adams' cowboy memoirs to &quot;American Life Histories&quot; by the WPA Project.

This is a fine collection of stories set in the West by a man who grew up on a big family ranch in southern Oregon and eventually settled as a writer in western Montana. Kittredge is a promoter of other Western writers' talent, editing anthologies like &quot;The Portable Western Reader&quot; for Penguin and helping to bring to the screen a film version of Norman Maclean's &quot;A River Runs Through It.&quot; In this collection of short stories, Kittredge reveals his own particular talents as a Western writer, drawing on his knowledge of rural and small town living in the Great Basin and Montana. His characters are genuine and deeply etched by the western code of individualism, self-sufficiency, and personal freedom. They are also haunted by the dark side of that code - isolation, loneliness, and restlessness.<br />The men in these stories are strong and independent, both physically and emotionally. But they are not infallible. The women in their lives typically reveal to them things about themselves they'd rather not know. A man who hires a crop-duster to spray his land discovers that the pilot's command of an airplane excites wanderlust in the wife he thought he knew. A 34-year-old man, taking a wife and fathering a child, discovers that she was once the lover of his married brother. A man goes in hunt of a grizzly after the killing of a young woman camper, and in a chilling temptation of fate, puts his life in the hands of another woman to whom he has given his high-powered rifle.<br />In other stories, a boy's idyllic life collapses into grief when his loving father dies while they are hunting geese in a frozen landscape. A combine operator harvests a field of wheat for a rancher and dies, his intestines perforated by a lifetime of hard work and hard knocks. A penniless cowboy works the ranch of a rich woman he has loved since she was a girl, knowing that &quot;There is nothing to own but what you do.&quot; An old man's daughter is shot and killed, and the young man who first romanced her pays a call on her mourning father.<br />The stories often deal with death or are about the defiance of death, and these themes seem to emerge from the landscape itself - remote, sparsely populated, given to extremes of heat and cold. The characters Kittredge creates are sharply drawn, and their speech is colorful and unschooled. Emotion surges beneath taciturn surfaces. There is tension in their unspoken desires, and for that reason the relationships between men and women are rarely untroubled. I highly recommend this collection of stories for readers interested in the West and the psychological impact of wide-open spaces and unsentimental lives. As a companion book, I'd also recommend Ralph Beer's terrific Montana novel, &quot;The Blind Corral.&quot;man who first romanced her pays a call on her mourning father. <br />The stories often deal with death or are about the defiance of death, and these themes seem to emerge from the landscape itself - remote, sparsely populated, given to extremes of heat and cold.

This book is for just about any only child growing up in the 1950s on a small farm in the middle of nowhere. It captures the inner world of a boy entering adolescence, with a strong religious upbringing, no extended family or friends, four miles from the road to town, with nothing but a drying-up river running nearby and flat land in all directions. Jacob, the central character of this short novel, spends his days alone with his wondering mind and vivid imagination, poised between his dreamy mother and his rough father. As if to fill the void of the family's routine, isolated existence, in which a trip to the Idaho state fair is a highlight of the year, an intense and violent melodrama unfolds around them and draws them all into its vortex.<br />The title is from a Perry Como recording of the period, and that softly romantic song and singer represent the untroubled surface of a time marked also by McCarthyism, racism, and social hypocrisy. Spanbauer pulls out all the stops as his young hero discovers both the fierce ugliness and the hidden beauty beneath his schoolboy illusions. In the end, after bloody fistfights, hard drinking, domestic abuse, bestiality, killings, a lynching, and arson, a very different song, the Ventures' rock and roll classic \\"Walk, Don't Run\\" is playing loudly on a car radio. Finally, the reader is left to wonder how much this coming-of-age story is itself an illusion filling the fevered imagination of a lonely farm boy. I recommend this one for anyone who believes that nothing is what it seems to be.	2004-03-21

As a reader whose interest is in the literature of the American West, rather than mystery writing, I had to be encouraged to read Tony Hillerman. And it was a happy discovery when I read &quot;Coyote Waits.&quot; With his cast of Navajo characters, including law officers Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, the author introduces readers to the world of the modern-day reservation and the surviving Navajo culture in the Four Corners area of New Mexico and Arizona.<br />The coyote of the title, from Navajo mythology, represents a darker side of human psychology, as it is understood by these Native Americans. It stands for the unexplainable destructive forces that disrupt all efforts to achieve the ideals of peace and harmony. Hillerman's understanding of Navajo customs and values, the legacy of white domination, and the complexities of law enforcement on the reservation makes the chapters of his book read like a fascinating social history.<br />You can also read this book with a road atlas open beside you. Hillerman places the story in a real world of highways, dirt tracks, natural landmarks, and small reservation towns, with side trips to Albuquerque.

This is an early McMurtry novel, a long, rambling story with young Patsy Carpenter at the center of a large cast of characters that includes graduate students, ranchers, rodeo cowboys, a Hollywood writer, Haight-Ashbury hippies, and wealthy Texans - both new and old money. Written in the late 1960s, and published in 1970, \\"Moving On\\" is interesting for its attempt to capture the subtly shifting moods of its central characters instead of focusing on action and storyline. As page follows page, McMurtry describes his characters' feelings of self-assurance, annoyance, boredom, frustration, and sexual tension. And often moods degenerate into tears - Patsy's in particular.<br />There's more than a bit of Henry Miller in much of the novel, as characters attempt to match up their levels of sexual passion, often finding that they are rarely feeling the same thing for each other at the same time. Seduction is often unsuccessful or unsatisfying, a rendezvous full of romantic promise may turn into an argument leaving both parties exhausted. A pass made after several drinks at a party or over a milk shake at a soda fountain may elicit an exchange of bitterness and barbed recriminations. A married couple talks openly of their infidelities. A wife accuses her husband of being neglectful, while she routinely meets a colleague of his for sex.<br />For readers who like action and narrative development, this book will seem very slow going. For some, the many shifts of mood and ironies of thwarted intentions will make the story seem flat and the central characters unfocused. By contrast, the marginal characters, especially an old widowed rancher, a rodeo clown and his young barrel-racer girlfriend, and a teenage bronc rider spring from the page fully realized. A few scenes are pumped up with melodrama (a professor's wife breaks down in front of the girl her husband has tried to seduce; a champion rodeo cowboy refuses to accept that a ranch-owning woman he's been bedding is growing tired of him; a pregnant young woman is rescued from a drugged existence with a sinister boyfriend). But the most crisply vivid and emotionally honest scenes involve the death and burial of an old man in the nearly treeless prairie northwest of Dallas. They're simple and understated like the country folks who people these pages.<br />McMurtry says that this novel emerged from an image of a young woman in a car eating a melted chocolate bar. What follows that image is one thing after another, until we reach the end almost 800 pages later, and that same woman, now divorcing her husband, feels a kind of independence that may never surrender itself to another man. Some readers will find this ending worth the trip; others may find themselves, like McMurtry's characters, in a somewhat different mood.d of him; a pregnant young woman is rescued from a drugged existence with a sinister boyfriend).

A rancher from Forsyth, Montana, with a gift of language, humor, and heart that makes his work rise far above the mainstream of this particular brand of American literature. This book is a collection of over 50 of his most popular poems, including classics such as \\"Reincarnation\\" and \\"Give Us a Song, Ian Tyson.\\"<br />Writing in western vernacular, with clever turns of phrase and imaginative turns of thought, he covers a range of subjects from cowboys and ranching to boot shopping and hollyhocks. There are poems on gooseberries, coyotes, and the change of seasons, and many are tongue in cheek, like a cross-cultural conversation with a hippie and cataloging the trials of raising a son who takes after yourself.<br />Yes, many of the poems are \\"curmudgeonly.\\" He complains about hunters and tourists, Californians and city folk in general, the environmental and social havoc of strip mining and clear cutting, and people who want to off-load their unwanted pets and unruly kids in the country. But just as often there is heart-felt sentiment, in the loss of a good hired hand who moves on, the loss of a neighbor whose ranch gets foreclosed, the retirement of an old rodeo bareback rider.<br />McRae's poems belong on anyone's shelf of western literature. He's the genuine article.	2004-02-11

This is a fine collection of stories by a young writer whose intuitive grasp of life's ambiguities combines with a well-developed storytelling ability to give the reader much to enjoy and ruminate on. Mostly set in a small town in western Nebraska, these stories have youthful protagonists who are often at a loss or are simply lost. Their lives have veered off course, somehow, or gone into a stall, and they're like the recovering young alcoholic in \\"Going Out,\\" who is sober but bewildered, losing ground, finally walking down a dark country road in his boxer shorts, startled by the ghostly face of a curious cow.<br />There is the mystery of identity that runs through many of these stories, from the young man in the first story \\"My Sister's Honeymoon: A Videotape,\\" who ponders his sister's personality change when she gets married, to the high school student in \\"Transformations,\\" whose older brother has revealed himself as not only gay but a female impersonator. In \\"Fraternity,\\" a young man discovers that a fraternity brother injured in a car accident is no longer the person he once was. A girlfriend in \\"Rapid Transit\\" tells a young office worker, \\"You're not who you think you are.\\"<br />Meanwhile children struggle to understand their parents. In two stories, the mothers have histories of mental illness. In another, the title story, a young man puzzles over a wayward older brother whose life seems to take a fatal turn after the telling of a lie. The richness of how circumstance alters and often diminishes identity is particularly well drawn in this story. The protagonist, on a visit home, reflects on how the loose threads of lives may come together for a moment in the mind's eye or the heart, like the neat ending of a short story, but because life is not art they unravel again.<br />While all this may sound a bit bleak, it is not. The stories leave you with uncertainties about the characters, whose lives are often tentative and touched with unresolved regrets, but there is a lightness and a degree of irony about them that make their ambiguities linger afterward in a way that's nicely gratifying. For another collection of well-written stories with a rural setting, I recommend Kent Meyers' \\"Light in the Crossing.\\" Also, set in a small town not far from Chaon's fictional St. Bonaventure, Nebraska, there's Kent Haruf's fine novel, \\"Plainsong.\\"e is a lightness and a degree of irony about them that make their ambiguities linger afterward in a way that's nicely gratifying.

The world created by the novel is one where people in one way or another are crushed by the circumstances of their lives. Set in the 1940s in some unnamed state on the Great Plains, it recounts the early adulthood of a man born on a sheep ranch. The life he inherits is one of loss, mischance, and isolation. One by one his brothers die or are killed, as are his parents, until he is the last one alive.  Although he is the point-of-view character throughout (and the reader is likely to feel trapped at times in his consciousness), we learn almost nothing of how he survives, except that he escapes for a while to work on a fishing boat in the Atlantic, and seems to turn off whatever thoughts he might have, knowing that any of them could easily lead him to despair.<br />Guilt and regrets visit him in the form of nightmares, in which a drowned man he once saw on a beach in Atlantic City haunts him wordlessly and gruesomely. These dreams merge so seamlessly with the narrative, it is easy to see the main character's daily existence as an unending bad dream. Briefly he becomes involved with a waitress at a restaurant in town, and in her presence he has moments that touch the tenderness in him, but the role he shoulders is to labor on alone, attempting to salvage the run-down family ranch with the help of hired hands either resigned as he is to their lot in life or bitterly resentful. When his brother, an artist, returns to the ranch with a girl he has met, her presence in this isolated world of laboring men takes a not surprising emotional toll.<br />This is a novel not for every taste. There's a bleakness that will disappoint readers looking for a more romanticized version of the subject matter. There's an emotional flatness that will not suit those looking for drama or even melodrama. There's an absence of introspection and reflection in the protagonist for those looking for psychological depth. Yet the novel chooses a minimalist narrative style (reflected, I suppose, in the absence of punctuation for dialogue) that is appropriate to its story and is in its own way compelling.<br />There is a kind of romance even in the absence of it that pulls you forward, watching the way events unfold among characters whose lives have been greatly reduced by the demands of an unforgiving environment. Author Lennon also has a remarkable gift of stark metaphor for capturing nuances of attitude and emotional coloring in both his characters and his landscape. Finally the book reveals much about sheep ranching for readers of Western literature who've become familiar with the details of raising and working cattle.

Montana novels are often about brothers (think of &quot;A River Runs Through It,&quot; &quot;The Power of the Dog,&quot; &quot;In Open Spaces&quot;). This is another one, and a very entertaining one. The narrator is a law school dropout whose family is giving up hope that he will ever turn out to be more than a drummer in a C&amp;W band. The brother, in this case, is a deputy sheriff, whose own aspirations have been frustrated by circumstance and who deals with adversity and his own bottled-up rage by being fiercely self-reliant and intimidating -- not someone who should have easy access to firearms. From the moment he steps into the story, he is both a menacing and comic presence.<br />Our hero blunders from one mischance to another, struggling to recover some self-esteem in a family where his litigator father smacks him across the face when the truth of his son's aborted law career becomes known. And his mother adds insult to injury with her undisguised scorn and disappointment. Only an older sister is able to provide some solace in this domestic storm. And there is welcome relief in the gigs he plays at local dance halls and bars with a hometown band, the Cloverleafs.<br />Emmons gives us a wonderful comic vision into the &quot;angst&quot; of our young hero. I laughed out loud often at the unexpected turns of plot, the quirky turns of conversation between unlikely and off-center characters, the free-for-all fist fights that break out in bars, the cowboy machismo that spills unwelcomed from pickup trucks with gun racks. A particular pleasure is the insight into the psychology of playing sets of dance music for a beer-drinking bar crowd. The prose takes flight in these scenes.<br />Although all does not end happily for everyone, the author pulls things together for our musician hero, providing him with a love interest, the beginnings of resolution with his parents, and a good lawyer to help him beat a felony rap. (You'll have to read the book.)

Published 30 years ago (1974), it takes place in the shadow that was cast by the nation's approaching bicentennial. While neither bitter nor angry, it manages anyway to portray a country that has little to show for itself but \\"greed and stupidity.\\" The values it embraces are finally those available to every American, native or otherwise - compassion and respect for life and the living.<br />The story concerns a few days in the life of a 32-year-old man, descendant of Indians and living in two worlds, his mother's home on the reservation and the dreary bars and hotels of nearby Havre and Malta, Montana. His days and nights blending together in an alcoholic haze, he meets a deranged white man, picks up women and gets punched in the nose. Meanwhile, he is haunted by a past that includes the death of an older brother and an injury to his knee that multiple operations have not remedied. Out of these unpromising circumstances, Welch finds the beginnings of a kind of personal salvation. By reaching back through the memory of a blind old man's act of charity, he restores the younger man's vision of himself.<br />Among the ranks of modern Native American writers, such as Louise Erdrich, Welch opens up a world for non-Indian readers that goes well beyond the usual stereotypes. His Indians are strikingly individual, absorbed in the everyday, motivated as much by self-interest and cock-eyed notions as their white counterparts. In Welch's hands, a conversation among five of them can be as comic and absurd as Ionesco. Meanwhile, the Native American past is there to ground a person with a sense of purpose and identity. For all its sorrows, Welch's story is finally a joy to read.	2004-01-17

You know when you read a finely crafted short story with vivid characters and incidents, and you wish it could go on and on? Well, this book is like that. It's written with the economy and attention to detail you find in a great short story, and instead of ending, it expands into a wonderful novel.<br />Long makes me think of both Chekhov and Anne Tyler. Here we have four sisters in a backwater town in northern Montana, each with a decidedly different character but still bound to each other in the way that families are. They emerge from girlhood, working in their father's restaurant, and one by one they take on their roles as adults. One marries a carpenter, fresh out of school. One marries an antique dealer. One goes off to San Francisco to live a kind of bohemian life; then returns; then leaves again. The youngest stays with her father, until he unexpectedly sells the restaurant.<br />It is 1952 when the novel starts. Then it jumps ahead to 1960, and the configuration of sisters takes a gradual turn as the young husband of one of them drifts into a relationship with another one. And when the inevitable revelation occurs, there is a bitter break-up, and a period of many months until things are patched up again.<br />The story is told mostly through the point of view of three characters - the young unfaithful husband, the youngest of the sisters, and her father, a widower whose days and nights are often warmly touched by memories of his dead wife. We meet several secondary characters, all sharply drawn and springing from the page in deftly told details of speech and behavior.<br />Long has a fine ability to capture characters and relationships in dialogue. He knows how people talk, how they use language to strike attitudes, pass judgments, reassure, humor each other. Meanwhile, the Montana seasons come and go - autumn, miserable winter, and early spring. Time passes, crises are resolved, lives move on. And after the pain of betrayal, separation, anger, and hurt, there is triumph over the forces that drive people apart.<br />I loved this book and happily recommend it to anyone who enjoys domestic comic-drama, memorable characters, and fine writing.ere is triumph over the forces that drive people apart. <br />I loved this book and happily recommend it to anyone who enjoys domestic comic-drama, memorable characters, and fine writing.	2004-01-15

Set on a Montana ranch in 1924-25, it tells of a domestic drama involving two brothers and the tensions that quickly develop when one of them marries a widow with a teenage son. The driving emotional force in the novel (and the \\"dog\\" of the title) is the older, unmarried brother, a fascinating study in western machismo, who is both sharply intelligent and capable of merciless cruelty, all apparently masking a fiercely denied homosexuality. The opening scene of the novel, with a vivid description of castrating calves graphically characterizes him as cutting and brutal, while wounded both emotionally and sexually. Savage is breathtakingly insightful in his portrayal of this man, exploring his darkest thoughts and carefully observing his behavior. He gets so far beneath the skin of the character, exposing the ugliness beneath his roughly handsome exterior, it makes you uncomfortable.<br />The novel is wonderfully crafted. Savage shifts easily from the point of view of one character to another, maybe 10-12 of them altogether. And even the most minor characters -- the cook, a maid, an Indian, the brothers' parents -- come to life vividly. The story is told economically, and narrative threads are dovetailed neatly together. Suspense builds steadily, and key details are placed strategically, so that when the final scenes play out, the ending is both surprising and inevitable.<br />Meanwhile the story takes place in a richly detailed context of everyday life of cowboys and ranch hands -- meals in the ranch house, the idle hours of Sundays around the bunkhouse, the ordering of items from the Sears Roebuck catalogue, and the work of taking cattle to market, branding, and haying. Savage is intimately aware of this world and the minds and attitudes, hopes and fears of the unschooled men who inhabit it.<br />Though it takes place on the other side of the continent, I was reminded of another writer, Richard Yates, whose \\"Revolutionary Road\\" (1961) has something of the same mood, and the same interest in the emotionally isolated lives of characters who are bound by the constraints of time and place. Annie Proulx writes an informative afterword to the new edition of Savage's novel. It's worth mentioning that she takes up the theme of homosexuality in a Western setting in her \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" which is included in her terrific collection of Wyoming stories \\"Close Range.\\"<br />I recommend \\"The Power of the Dog\\" to readers interested in Western fiction, Montana ranch life in the early 20th century, psychological studies, and domestic drama that focuses on the interplay of family members' strengths and weaknesses.

In both fiction and nonfiction, he's hard to beat. This collection of short essays describes his life as a rancher outside Helena, Montana. Many of them are humorous and rich with Western wit; some have a melancholy undertone; all are very finely crafted.<br />Working a ranch that has been in his family for four generations, Beer slowly comes to terms with the futility of maintaining a lifestyle that can no longer be justified as a way to make a living. As cattle prices fail to meet the rising costs of running a ranch, it is finally only humor, sentiment, self-respect and the well-worn romance of the rural West that keep him going. Beer's wonderful essays chart the gradual decline of ranching, even as he puts in new fences and throws himself into the yearly rounds of upkeep and improvements.<br />Meanwhile, many of Beer's essays use humor to deromanticize the Western mystique. A trip into town becomes an occasion to reveal himself as a fish out of water. The descriptions of ranch work often reveal him struggling with uncooperative equipment and stock, often in brutal weather. A tongue-in-cheek discourse on pickups explores the special kind of love affair between men and their trucks.<br />Other essays are rich with boyhood memories of his father and grandfather and the friendships of men who have been long-time neighbors and mentors. Some essays are celebrations of skills and craftsmanship no longer appreciated, the building of a log barn by his great-grandfather, the work of a hayfield irrigator, his own reconstruction of an old snowplow, the way a natural horseman rides a horse. In these, the essays become a balancing between a sense of people and times slipping into the irretrievable past and an embrace of what is still there to be cherished in moments of grace and pride.<br />Many thanks to the University of Nebraska Press for keeping this wonderful book in print. May it find the many readers it deserves.

Prospective readers should note that positive reviews of this book attract unhelpful votes. Not surprisingly, the LDS church has expressed concern over the content of \\"Under the Banner of Heaven,\\" as it might no matter how its subject matter is treated, since it deals with an aspect of Mormonism that from the church's point of view is not Mormon at all - the fundamentalist splinter groups that deny the legitimacy of the church and feel that it has abandoned the burning vision of its founder, Joseph Smith.<br />Minute in number (1/100th the size of the mainstream church), fundamentalists get more than their share of attention. This is due in part because they aggressively practice polygamy, a form of social organization that runs sharply counter to mainstream American values, while at the same time it deeply fascinates outsiders because of its view of human sexuality. Combine this with two religiously inspired murders, which form the central thread in this book, and you have compelling material for a writer of Krakauer's investigative skills and ability to capture what he learns in a vivid narrative.<br />Like Krakauer's earlier book, \\"Into the Wild,\\" the book is constructed as something of a mystery. How did two brothers, who had grown up in a god-fearing, apparently wholesome family go so far off the path of mainstream Mormon faith that in the name of God they would brutally murder their young sister-in-law and baby? The answer or answers, as he looks for them, take Krakauer not only to the far-flung fundamentalist communities in remote parts of the US, Mexico and Canada but back in time to the origins of the church in the charismatic leadership of Joseph Smith, the community of the faithful who grew up around him, and the animosity of non-Mormons, which eventually reached to the federal government. Krakauer views the modern-day murders through a history of bloodshed, including the death of Joseph Smith, as the early LDS church fought for its life, eventually fleeing to the wastelands of the Great Basin in what is now Utah. Even here the bloodshed did not end, as Krakauer notes in his account of the Mountain Meadow massacre of a wagon train bound for California.<br />In the end, Krakauer turns to the testimonies of psychologists at one of the murder trials to reveal, in theory at least, how culture and circumstances conspired to produce two cold-blooded killers, neither of whom feels remorse for their actions. Whether these expert witnesses shed enough light to account for what happened is up to the reader to decide, but they do make one thing clear - as deluded as both brothers seem, they were never insane, but from beginning to end, no matter how extreme their behavior, they remained in full possession of their reason. They knew exactly what they were doing.<br />I don't believe Krakauer intends to fault the LDS church, but it is easy to see how any LDS reader would find his book unflattering. Where a non-Mormon reader would find certain details difficult to comprehend or regard with sympathy, one notes a tone of irony slipping into the word choice and the point of view. Certainly the selection of details contributes to a darker vision of Mormonism, simply by its unfortunate association with extreme fundamentalism. Keeping all this in mind, however, I strongly recommend the book. It is compelling reading and hard to put down.urch fought for its life, eventually fleeing to the wastelands of the Great Basin in what is now Utah.

It began as something of a retreat and became a life-long attachment. This book, published in 1974, is a humorously thoughtful description of how this new landowner becomes equally owned by the land he has settled on.<br />Not a long book, it reads at a leisurely pace, as Graves traces the history of the land, once fertile and grass-covered. He tells what he knows of the numerous tribes of Native Americans who once lived on it, including the fierce Comanches. Then he characterizes the first settlers, who knew next to nothing about land stewardship and cared less, exhausting it with poor farming techniques, overgrazing, and a single-crop economy--cotton. We learn of the toll taken in depleted soil, diminished flood control, and the spread of cedar and scrub brush across former prairie. And we learn of the descendants of these early settlers, diminished by reduced circumstances, some of them making a living by cutting down cedar brakes into fence posts.<br />Having established the history of the land, Graves takes us on a tour of his farm, which he calls Hard Scrabble, describing in turn the fields and streams, the plant and animal life, the weather. Then he describes the long, slow process of reclaiming what he can of his 400 acres, clearing the land, building a house, barn, and other outbuildings, learning stone masonry and carpentry as he goes. In connection with this subject, there is a discourse on the industriousness and workmanship of Mexican laborers, all of them illegal, who help him with building, fencing, and fighting back the growth of unwanted brush and cedar. On the subject of animal husbandry, he tells of raising cattle and goats. And in the investment of himself in all of these he ruminates on how they transform him and root this former world-traveler more firmly into a rural frame of mind.<br />Of the many things I enjoyed in this book, I especially liked his capturing of the way his country neighbors talk. Their points of view and temperaments are captured in quirky turns of phrase and syntax. An episode involving local fox hunters is a joy to read. Graves is in many ways a Texas version of E. B. White, transplanted from city to country and not only seeing this remote environment with fresh eyes but engaging physically with it, befriending the long-time inhabitants, and discovering a way of life only dimly understood by city-dwellers. Although Graves' writing style is more given to verbal flourishes, his wry humor and literary allusions remind one of White's collection of essays on living in Maine, &quot;One Man's Meat.&quot;<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in country life, Texas, subsistence farming, and natural history. As companions to &quot;Hard Scrabble,&quot; I would recommend books by three other rancher/farmer writers: &quot;Windbreak,&quot; by South Dakota writer Linda Hasselstrom, &quot;A Collection of Cowboy Logic&quot; by North Dakota writer Ryan Taylor, and &quot;Sketches From the Ranch&quot; by Montana writer Dan Aadland.<br />Of the many things I enjoyed in this book, I especially liked his capturing of the way his country neighbors talk. Their points of view and temperaments are captured in quirky turns of phrase and syntax. An episode involving local fox hunters is a joy to read. Graves is in many ways a Texas version of E. B. White, transplanted from city to country and not only seeing this remote environment with fresh eyes but engaging physically with it, befriending the long-time inhabitants, and discovering a way of life only dimly understood by city-dwellers.

I came across John Haines while reading William Kittredge's great anthology \\"The Portable Western Reader.\\" Haines is better known as a poet, and maybe that's why these essays are so vividly written. They represent a period of years from the 1940s to the 1980s during which Haines homesteaded off and on near Richardson, in central Alaska. They are only somewhat reflective and focus instead on capturing the raw experience of living in the woods, along creeks and rivers, through the seasons of the year. As a homesteader, Haines lived off the land, raising his own vegetables, hunting game, and trapping marten, lynx, beaver, and fox. Many of the essays concern hunting and killing animals, and they are written in a matter-of-fact way that may repel some readers. They do, however, capture a point of view toward wildlife that is possible for a man of letters to entertain, and as such they illuminate a set of values that has a long history among people who have lived by hunting and gathering on the frontiers of the world.<br />For me, the memorable essays in the collection deal with the kind of isolation that the author has chosen to live in. One essay describes a three-day winter journey to check trap lines, cataloguing in detail how he dresses, the gear and food he takes with him, and the one dog that accompanies him. Along the way, he has a close encounter with a grizzly, which highlights the vulnerability of a single man in this remote terrain, and there is the description of overnighting in a cabin, where he is alone with his thoughts as darkness falls early, silence reins, and the cold night sky fills with stars. Another essay is a long account of how the streams and a nearby river gradually freeze over in the autumn and winter. With his poet's eyes and ears, Haines describes how ice forms and the sounds made by flowing water as it freezes, until it is utterly silent under snow.<br />A few essays describe the men who live in this area, swapping stories about others who have chosen this faraway world to live in alone and make what living they can to keep soul and body together, season after season. Given these lives of isolation, the prevalence of dark and cold, and the recurring theme of death and dying, there is a certain melancholy throughout the book. You put it down at the end with a kind of respect for Haines' clear-eyed vision and sensibilities and certainly his skill as a writer. The simplicity of a life stripped to essentials (work, food, sleep) will have an appeal for some readers who dream of self-sufficiency and getting away from it all. But the romanticism Haines evokes has much to do with a test of character, spirit, and physical stamina. The tough and the lucky survive, but only for as long as the wilderness lets them.have chosen this faraway world to live in alone and make what living they can to keep soul and body together, season after season.

At 600 pages, his book is an introduction to over 70 writers from the journals of Lewis and Clark and the collectors of Native American chants and tales to the writers of late 20th century fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.<br />Some are well known and easily associated with the West: Wallace Stegner, A. B. Guthrie, Louise Erdrich, John Steinbeck, Edward Abbey, Maxine Hong Kingston, Raymond Carver, Larry McMurtry, Ken Kesey. Many are lesser known and deserving of a wider audience, such as James Galvin, Sherman Alexie, and Linda Hogan. As someone less familiar with the poetry inspired by the region, I appreciated selections from a wide range of poets, including the influential Montana poet Richard Hugo.<br />Describing the experience of reading this book is like trying to sum up a year traveling in another country. There are several familiar works: Wallace Stegner's great story \\"Carrion Spring,\\" set on the northern plains during the spring thaw after a horrific winter kill; the opening of Ivan Doig's wonderful Montana memoir \\"This House of Sky\\"; Terry Tempest Williams' chilling essay on the rising incidence of breast cancer in her family after above-ground nuclear testing in 1950s Nevada; childhood memories of homesteading in the Nebraska Panhandle, from Mari Sandoz' book about her father, \\"Old Jules\\"; a discourse on water from Gretel Ehrlich's essays about ranching in Wyoming, \\"The Silence of Open Spaces.\\"<br />There's also Edward Abbey's account of summer work as a park ranger in Utah's Arches National Monument from \\"Desert Solitaire\\"; a poignant memory of fishing in Norman Maclean's \\"A River Runs Through It\\"; a brief scene featuring the joyous prankster McMurphy, later immortalized by Jack Nicholson, from Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\"; a section about a man who stakes a claim on the Wyoming-Colorado border from James Galvin's brilliantly written memoir-novel, \\"The Meadow\\"; the evocation of a ghost town and the Nebraska prairie in the opening pages of Wright Morris' novel \\"Ceremony in Lone Tree\\"; and one of the many humorous recollections of frontier cowboy Teddy Blue Abbott, as he remembers his friendship with Calamity Jane.<br />And there are wonderful discoveries. I liked Rick Marinis' short story \\"Paraiso: An Elegy\\" about two couples from El Paso on a car trip; Richard Nelson's account of deer hunting in Alaska from \\"The Island Within\\"; Raymond Carver's memories of his alcoholic father in \\"My Father's Life\\"; Larry McMurtry's demythologizing memories of his cowboy-rancher uncles in \\"Take My Saddle From the Wall: A Valediction\\"; Mary Clearman Blew's harrowing memoir of marriage to a wildcat oilman with a terminal pulmonary illness, from \\"All But the Waltz\\"; David Long's story of a ranch family's disintegration, \\"Lightning\\"; and John Haines' description of nightfall in a remote Alaska cabin in \\"The Stars, The Snow, The Fire.\\" Among the poets, I found the Hawaiian/LA voice of Garrett Hongo, the dark vision of Robert Wrigley, and the thoughtful ruminations of Montana poet Greg Pape.<br />Altogether there are voices of all kinds between the covers of this book. You get a sense of great diversity bound together by a vast landscape. There are a few themes that run through most of these selections, which are also common to literature about the West: freedom, loss, and isolation. The expansiveness of the West has traditionally permitted a kind of liberation from what is restrictive and claustrophobic in the settled East. The flip side of that freedom, of course, is the isolation that comes with living lives beyond the reach of other people. Meanwhile, expansion into the West has meant the loss of what was pristine and unexploited; it's meant the loss of Native American cultures; and as the West evolves, it has meant the loss of the frontier itself. Even as we have discovered the West, it is disappearing.<br />Kittredge's book has captured all that, as well as one can in 600 pages. I heartily recommend his book to anyone interested in the real West, what it was and what it is. As the editor of this anthology, Kittredge has graciously not included anything from his own pen; so I'll recommend his well-written memoir of growing up on a ranch in Oregon, \\"Hole in the Sky.\\" Two other collections of Western writing I can recommend are \\"Northern Lights: A Selection of New Writing from the American West,\\" edited by Deborah Clow (currently out of print) and \\"The Big Sky Reader,\\" edited by Alan Jones (also currently out of print).has meant the loss of the frontier itself.

Also a storyteller, Russell wrote this collection of yarns and memories before his death, commemorating frontier life in the closing decades of the nineteenth century. It was published in 1927, with an introduction by Will Rogers in the form of a cowboy eulogy. The original edition featured more than 50 of Russell's illustrations, some of them in color.<br />Unlike the fairly rollicking account of Teddy Blue Abbott, his cowboy contemporary, Russell's book is a more melancholy view of what he remembers as the good old days. His stories are told in an ironic vernacular by an old-timer cowboy named Rawhide Rawlins. Many concern the adventures of cowboys; many also feature Native Americans, in the early years of the agencies (reservations), portrayed with some complexity of feelings, ranging from fear and distrust to respect. Some are outrageously tall tales. Some are spirited character sketches, capturing something of life on the rough, raw land before settlement and homesteading, the motorcar, and civilization - before the plow broke the prairie sod where buffalo and then cattle and cowboys ranged freely.<br />One of the finest pieces of Western writing occurs in the last chapter, &quot;Longrope's Last Guard,&quot; which describes in vivid detail the experience of riding herd on a pitch dark night as the stillness is shattered by an electrical storm that stampedes the cattle and takes the life of one of the men. The burial of the dead cowboy on the open prairie and the subsequent disappearance of his grave is symbolic of the passing of the brief frontier era Russell's words and pictures embrace.<br />I recommend this book for its capturing of the historical cowboy as remembered by a man who was there and lived among them. As a companion volume, I also recommend Teddy Blue Abbott's &quot;We Pointed Them North,&quot; a well-detailed and more light-hearted recollection of the same time and place.h,&quot; a well-detailed and more light-hearted recollection of the same time and place.	2003-10-30

I first came across Rick Bass in the very readable collection &quot;Big Sky Reader.&quot; His essay there about accompanying a friend on a fishing trip with several out-of-state fishermen was an enjoyable glimpse into the lives of folks in the thinly populated woods of the far northwestern corner of Montana. It's a self-sufficient kind of life, where people make do with few amenities in exchange for the beauty and solitude of the mountains and the isolation that comes with many months of snow and cold.<br />That essay, &quot;This Savage Land,&quot; appears in this collection of the author's nonfiction. However, instead of the self-effacing, quiet humor of that essay, the rest of this book is a poignant account of an apparently doomed effort to preserve the Yaak River valley as a wilderness and bring a stop to the clear-cut logging that has been steadily turning it into a vast area of devastation. Chapters describing the author's letter-writing campaigns and his trip to Washington DC to make his case before Montana's congressmen alternate with descriptions of walks on the mountains, sighting bears and other wildlife, discoursing on the delicately interrelated flora and fauna, and admiring what is left of the old growth forests. There's also a chapter on the experience of the winter months and another on a summer of fires in the mountains and the role that fire plays in the regeneration and preservation of forests.<br />Through it all are the themes of loss and the ruinous harm of the logging industry, which he believes is not simply destroying a wilderness area but removing a critical link connecting regions where grizzlies, wolves, and other forms of wilderness wildlife still survive. When that connection is gone, he believes that these creatures will quickly die out. Meanwhile, the poet in him believes that something also dies within humankind when the wilderness is gone, and he reminds us that once it's gone it will be gone forever.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in the mountainous West, nature writing, and the lives of people in sparsely populated and isolated areas. It's also a book for those whose hearts respond to the call of the wild and who are concerned by the destruction of national forests by the heedless economics of the logging industry and its strangle-hold in government and other seats of power.nyone interested in the mountainous West, nature writing, and the lives of people in sparsely populated and isolated areas.

This is an as-told-to memoir of the early years of a cowboy who grew up in Nebraska and drove cattle along the western trails, settling in Montana, where he worked for several cattle owners, all during the 1870s and 1880s. His story covers that brief period of time when the West was open range, before settlers began putting up fences. It's a story told in the 1930s by an old man to a woman from the East, Helena Huntington Smith, who had the presence of mind to capture his life in the printed word before his generation had passed completely (Abbott died in 1939).<br />Teddy Blue, as he was called, was something of a rip-tearer in his youth, living up to the wilder stereotype of rangeland cowboys, by his own account. On the one hand, there is the fierce recklessness of herding cattle, which through accident and various mishaps took the lives of many young men. And then there is his life in town, befriending prostitutes, drinking hard, shooting up saloons, and on occasion riding his horse indoors.<br />His favorite job is working as a &quot;rep&quot; for cattle-owners, going to the regular roundups where cattle were sorted and branded, requiring him to retain a vast knowledge of brands used on the range and other markings. For a while, he works for stockman Granville Stuart, who headed up a vigilante effort that significantly reduced the number of active cattle rustlers in Montana. Stuart eventually becomes Abbott's reluctant father-in-law, after the young penniless cowboy takes a shine to one of his daughters.<br />The book rambles back and forth in time as Abbott more or less free-associates for Smith. And while scholars may question the accuracy of his memory at points, he was easily one of the more widely known figures of the old West for his personality and antics, not to mention having befriended the likes of cowboy artist and writer Charlie Russell, as well as Calamity Jane, even crossing paths with Teddy Roosevelt. His story makes an enjoyable read and evokes with feeling those early &quot;innocent&quot; days of an adventurous youth lived when the West was young as he was. His admiration for the Cheyenne Indians is, he admits, unusual for a white man of the times. And though they were both the best and worst of times (e.g., the crippling winter of 1886-87), he shares with Charlie Russell a nostalgic belief that they were the good old days, the likes of which haven't been seen since.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in cowboying and the old West. It is full of stories and yarns, social history, frontier customs and mores that make that time come alive with an immediacy and intimacy that are seldom found in records of the period.ith feeling those early &quot;innocent&quot; days of an adventurous youth lived when the West was young as he was.

I had no expectations when I picked up this novel, except that I'd read a nonfiction piece by the author, a Montana writer, enjoyed his point of view, and marveled at his gift of language. As a novelist, he offers up a story and characters that are vivid and real, and the language that describes their world is close to poetry. There's a wonderful precision in the detail and the word choice that makes you just slow down and relish each sentence as it evokes the experience of being alive under this big sky through the roll of the seasons.<br /><br /> The story is told through the perspective of a young man returning home to his father and grandfather, outside Helena, Montana. He's had some hard luck, an accident on a firing range that has put him in a military hospital, and before that a rodeo career that has gone nowhere. The stopover is meant to be temporary, but like wild horses drawn unwittingly into the blind corral of the title, he is unable to leave, spending a bitter winter with his dying grandfather, an aging rancher, instead of returning to Canada as planned and a woman he has taken up with.<br /><br /> There is an aching melancholy throughout the novel that fills the scenes with a sense of loss. The ranchland, which no longer supports the cattle business, is being bought up by developers. The generation that grew up there and made a living from it, through good years and bad, is now passing on. They have little to leave their descendants but the land itself, worth little more than what it can be sold for. And there is irony in how losing the land mirrors the same loss by the Indians who preceded them a century earlier.<br /><br /> But it's also a personal story, of the young hero's return from adventures that have left him empty and without direction. His fate is played out in a man's world where women, if they figure at all, are as tough and independent as the men. The toughness is both a strength that protects them and a tragic flaw that leads them into lives of emotional isolation. When an old man dies, the best that can be said of him is that &quot;he was hard on horses; he never forgot a grudge; he either liked you or he didn't.&quot;<br /><br /> On the downbeat side, yes, but there is also a quiet beauty in this novel. The land, though scarred and abused, still consoles the soul. And the reader is left on the cusp of both sorrow and admiration for these characters who can tough it out, each a surviving fragment of the old West, clinging to a kind of dignity in a new West that is tawdry and shallow by comparison.lation.

Expecting to find some salty insight into the hearts and minds of cowboys, the men who live and work as agricultural laborers in the modern West, I found instead the memoir of a young man from Chicago, still in his 30s, who falls in love with wide open spaces and tries to live out a dream of working with cattle and being a rancher. The problem is that he is almost totally unprepared for the arduous task of running a ranch and lacks the seasoned philosophy of a man who has experienced lean years, loss, and failure. Taking on a 15-square-mile ranch outside Miles City, Montana, he is quickly in over his head and in a matter of time is surviving on anti-depressants.<br />Hard winters, hard luck, and lack of experience combine to turn his dream into heartbreak. I seldom read a book that makes me tear up, but this one did, about page 220 when on a September day, he watches as his neighbors gather to buy at auction his machinery and equipment. Any reader used to the unforgiving seasons of the plains, especially in Montana, might remain dried-eyed at Groneberg's foolhardy and romantic expectations of ranching, but to know him for the tender, ingenuous soul that he seems to be in his book, it's hard to see his failure as anything but the unhappy end of a big-hearted dream.<br />The secret in the secret life of cowboys remains something of an elusive mystery for Groneberg. Along with him, we observe cowboys from the outside, a fraternity of men engaged in hard, physical labor, masters of skills learned from boyhood, able to do their jobs in severe working conditions, and possessors of a kind of grace beyond words to describe. Groneberg's book is an attempt over and over to capture this grace in words, always falling a little short, while making ever more vivid the extent of his admiration. He even takes a class in saddle bronc riding in hopes of breaking through this barrier and feeling at least for a moment like a cowboy.<br />In anyone else's hands, this might all seem over the top, but his love of cowboys comes from a heart that is pure as a boy's, and it is easy to allow him his earnest wish to become and be accepted as a man of their perceived character - honest, true, fearless, tough, physically agile, and ethically uncompromised. At the end of the book, he has not yet forgiven himself for being less than all that, but he has found a place for himself as a hand on another smaller ranch, chastened by his experiences toward a kind of self-respect and most importantly loving the life he has found for himself, his wife, and young son.<br />I'm happy to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in ranching, the modern West, Montana, rites of passage, and soulful memoirs. Along similar lines, I'd recommend the personal stories of some other youthful writers from the West: C. L. Rawlins' &quot;Broken Country,&quot; Mark Spragg's &quot;Where Rivers Change Direction,&quot; Pete Fromm's &quot;Indian Creek Chronicles,&quot; and Edward Abbey's &quot;Desert Solitaire.&quot;r />In anyone else's hands, this might all seem over the top, but his love of cowboys comes from a heart that is pure as a boy's, and it is easy to allow him his earnest wish to become and be accepted as a man of their perceived character - honest, true, fearless, tough, physically agile, and ethically uncompromised.

It honors J. Frank Dobie (1888-1963), a prominent folklorist and also a secretary and editor of the TFS, 1923-1943. The essays range very broadly across subject matter and types of scholarship, from simple reminiscences of the past in the spirit of the book's title to more academic studies.<br />My favorites in the book are essays on cowboys by Andy Adams (\\"The American Cowboy,\\" first published in 1905)and Eugene Manlove Rhodes (\\"The Cowboy: His Cause and Cure,\\" first published in 1923).  Another, \\"The Cowboy's Code,\\" by Paul Patterson (then president of TFS) is a wonderful reminiscence of the 12 Unwritten Rules of cowboying, ranging from Never Let Go of a Horse That Has Thrown You to Let There Be No Petty Thievery.<br />A. L. Bennett writes a historical essay on the \\"Sanctified Sisters,\\" a commune of women in post Civil War Texas who forswore sex (after its founder had given birth to 12 children) and grew to some prominence in the latter decades of the 19th century. Francis E. Abernathy has an amusing account of fox hunting in East Texas, and E. J. Rissmann recalls the process of making charcoal during the Depression. There's a discourse on the subject of \\"poke sallet,\\" correcting the errors perpetuated in standard reference books regarding this culinary folk dish. And one writer discusses the maudlin sentimentality of the penny dreadfuls, which found their way during the 19th century from England to the American frontier.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Texas folklore and especially the social history and the stories, songs, and poems that passed by word of mouth across the generations, traveling westward with the settlement of the frontier.	2003-09-06
US	51205644	R3DUYUL0HLRIBT	0231118589	470695395	Losing Matt Shepard	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Reclaiming Laramie	Those looking for a journalistic treatment of this subject, exposing sensational details and vivid personalities, will be disappointed in this book. It is an even-handed, somewhat reserved reflection on the events that swept the people of Laramie, Wyoming, into the national spotlight when Matt Shepard was murdered in October 1998. While there are several themes in the book, the chief one is the hysteria of the national media, which transformed the story of a young man's beating and death into a horrific hate crime, with all the over-simplification, instant analysis, and easy generalizations of highly competitive news organizations. Understanding the vast complexity of the social context that the murder emerged from and its meaning in terms of the people who make up the fabric of that community have been left for more thoughtful observers, writers and thinkers like the author, who can with greater knowledge, sensitivity, and analytical abilities address the central question, what REALLY happened?<br />Given the polarizing issue of sexual orientation, it's easy for readers to fault Loffreda for her refusal to reduce the subject to a black-and-white matter of homophobia. She makes an interesting argument about hate crimes, using Matt's murder as a way to show that the notion of a crime motivated purely by hate is an abstraction, and what really motivated this murder was a whole tapestry of motives having to do with social class, intent to rob, upbringing, a macho culture, and a depressed social and economic environment. If you boil it down to anything, what seems to be at the root of the crime is a simple wish to bully, intimidate, and victimize someone perceived as weaker. Where is the hate and where is the bias in all this, she wonders. It's there, yes, but so is much else that can't be addressed by labeling it as a bias crime.<br />Much of the book is also an attempt to represent the distinctive \\"lifestyle\\" of gay men and women living in a rural, thinly populated state, where being \\"out\\" is not an option, and there is a generally held belief that homosexuality does not exist there. Involved as she is with the gay community in Laramie, the author is familiar with many gay men and women who appear in the pages of her book, each expressing varying responses to the murder of one of their own. What's instructive is that \\"gay community\\" is a misnomer here, where there essentially is none. There is little organization and few resources to make a difference either socially or politically. Instead, national organizations and their celebrity representatives swoop in to capitalize on Matt's murder in the interest of their own agendas, both pro- and anti-gay. Matt gets \\"lost\\" in many ways, and this is only one of them.<br />Loffreda does not set out to win back Matt Shepard, but she does a lot to recover Laramie itself. She reclaims a town in its own terms, not those of the media. While she struggles with residents' resistance to change and the inappropriateness of their responses (emphasizing emotion rather than action), she acknowledges a wide-spread decency, a feeling of remorse, and a genuine wish to overcome complacency. For the gay men and women of Laramie, not a lot changes. There is still fear and anger, to go along with invisibility. But there is also love of this place on the wind-swept prairie, and a belief that for all its drawbacks, this is home.<br />I recommend this book for its attempt to undo the damage done by the occupying army of the national media. In that respect, it makes an interesting companion to the film \\"Bowling for Columbine.\\"ate, where being \\"out\\" is not an option, and there is a generally held belief that homosexuality does not exist there. Involved as she is with the gay community in Laramie, the author is familiar with many gay men and women who appear in the pages of her book, each expressing varying responses to the murder of one of their own.

Matt gets \\"lost\\" in many ways, and this is only one of them.<br />Loffreda does not set out to win back Matt Shepard, but she does a lot to recover Laramie itself. She reclaims a town in its own terms, not those of the media. While she struggles with residents' resistance to change and the inappropriateness of their responses (emphasizing emotion rather than action), she acknowledges a wide-spread decency, a feeling of remorse, and a genuine wish to overcome complacency. For the gay men and women of Laramie, not a lot changes. There is still fear and anger, to go along with invisibility. But there is also love of this place on the wind-swept prairie, and a belief that for all its drawbacks, this is home. <br />I recommend this book for its attempt to undo the damage done by the occupying army of the national media. In that respect, it makes an interesting companion to the film \\"Bowling for Columbine.\\"	2003-09-04

On the one hand, he embodies a great many American values: idealism, a willingness to take risks, a wish for personal development and spiritual fulfillment, a love of nature and the outdoors, a romantic attachment to the open road, an egalitarian openness to the common man, a respect for hard physical labor, honesty, trust, loyalty, commitment to one's own vision. All of these attributes are wrapped up in a precocious, thoughtful, bright young man who charmed the strangers he met on the road, made them care about his welfare, and was even deeply loved. He is in many ways a modern-day Thoreau, a hero in the style of Joseph Campbell, following his bliss.<br />On the other hand, McCandless is willful, heedless, self-indulgent, reluctant to become emotionally attached to other people, vindictive toward his parents, and unaware of the pain that his potential death could have on those who love him. In short, he is a fascinating psychological mystery, full of contradictions he seems unaware of. Many readers will dismiss him as a weirdo and the book as a waste of time, but I believe the best way to approach the book is to suspend judgement and simply read it as a character study of an amazingly complex human being. Ironically, like many a young man, McCandless puts his life on the line for the sake of adventure and one day may have written his own best-selling book about it if he'd only had the good luck to survive.<br />Krakauer tells a wonderful story. The many people he interviews breathe with life and feeling, and the places he travels to are vividly described. Looking at his subject from many angles, he includes cameo biographies of other men who have met untimely ends in the wilderness, including Everett Ruess, another young man very similar to McCandless, who disappeared in the canyon country along the Colorado River in Utah in 1934. And he uses himself as an example, describing a youthful attempt to scale a forbidding Alaskan mountain in the dead of winter and capturing the nearly mindless devotion to an impossibly risky objective.<br />If deliberately risking your life in a long-shot gamble at self-realization is your idea of something totally stupid, then you probably should stay away from this book. But I recommend it as a mesmerizing, haunting psychological study of an adolescent rite of passage. I also recommend it to anyone who is fascinated by wilderness and living off the land under conditions that are hazardous, forbidding and transportingly beautiful.luding Everett Ruess, another young man very similar to McCandless, who disappeared in the canyon country along the Colorado River in Utah in 1934.

This true-to-life story of an 1882 cattle drive is his best known, and its retelling 100 years later in Larry McMurtry's &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; is evidence of its importance among early works of Western fiction.<br />Here the protagonist is a young cowboy much like the author, who trailed beef from Texas to Montana at a time just after the buffalo herds were being extinguished from the short grass prairies and homesteading had not yet fenced in the high plains. Oklahoma was still &quot;Indian Territory,&quot; Little Big Horn was a recent memory, and Native Americans were in the last shameful stages of being forced off the open rangeland. The railroads were snaking across the land making frontier boom towns where law and order either prevailed (Dodge) or more often did not (Ogallala), and the vast cattle herds of Texas and Mexico finally had a market and access to it.<br />Adams was born into this world and as a young man cowboyed during the height of the cattle drive era. His book is an account of one trek, delivering 3,000 head of cattle to the Blackfoot Agency in northern Montana. For the protagonist, the initial excitement wears off once the daily routine is established, and besides the occasional stampede and wet weather, the highlights of the journey are brief visits to the cowtowns they pass along the way and the many river crossings, some of which pose enormous difficulties.<br />We get to know all the men in the outfit by name, and a few stand out, including Flood the foreman, McCann the cook, and the protagonist's trail mate The Rebel, who is older and wiser and something of a mentor. Other personalities emerge, primarily around the campfire on nights when the men get to swapping stories. And Adams passes on a lot of first-hand knowledge about trailing cattle, riding horses, and the day-to-day operation of a drive. Days and nights of the routine are punctuated by episodes of another kind: a rigged horse race, in which the cowboys lose several hundred dollars in wagers, two saloon shootings, the breakdown of the chuck wagon, pulling cattle out of a boggy river, meeting potentially hostile Indians, an encounter with cattle thieves, and a long drive across a waterless expanse of Wyoming.<br />Reproduced from the original edition published in 1903, the text has an old fashioned look and feel that suit the subject matter and the prose style well. There are also five illustrations. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot; Adams captures the excitement and the reality of the old West before it was romanticized and mythologized by the movies and popular fiction. As companion volumes, I would recommend Ramon Adams' &quot;Cowboy Lingo&quot; and &quot;Come an' Get It,&quot; which provide much informative background on open range cowboying. With a good road atlas at hand, you're also able to follow the track of the drive across six western states, from Brownsville to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.s and nights of the routine are punctuated by episodes of another kind: a rigged horse race, in which the cowboys lose several hundred dollars in wagers, two saloon shootings, the breakdown of the chuck wagon, pulling cattle out of a boggy river, meeting potentially hostile Indians, an encounter with cattle thieves, and a long drive across a waterless expanse of Wyoming.<br />Reproduced from the original edition published in 1903, the text has an old fashioned look and feel that suit the subject matter and the prose style well.

As a young Texas cowboy in the 1920s and 30s, Green made a living going after these hard-to-catch cattle, and this book is a collection of accounts of his successes (if he ever missed any, he doesn't mention it). Usually he works alone, on horseback, gathering up cows a few at a time and driving them to the nearest train station where they can be shipped to market. Typically he has worked a deal with the owner, buying them &quot;range delivery,&quot; and spending sometimes many weeks to outsmart the critters, often one by one, to get them roped, corralled, or whatever it takes.<br />A young, tough, wild cowboy, as he often refers to himself, he has more than his share of hot, sweaty work, getting bunged up, frustrated, and frequently outmaneuvered. On one job, he's also shunned by a whole community of folk who regard him with disdain as he works to gather up a herd of cows for a bank collecting a bad debt. Each account is different, presenting a very different situation, and Green takes the reader along as he mulls over the problem, tries this and then that, eventually finding a solution.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a departure from other books about cowboying, and it gets very much into cowboy psychology and the wealth of knowledge acquired in dealing daily with cattle. Green writes in a conversational style, with dry humor and a leisurely way of setting scenes and describing action, meanwhile building a kind of suspense as he figures out each time how to outsmart his &quot;wild cows.&quot;<br />Thanks to the University of Nebraska Press for reprinting this and many other classics of western literature. Western illustrator Lorence Bjorklund provides many fine drawings, and with the cover design from a painting by W.H.D. Koerner they capture the spirit of this book wonderfully. I happily recommend this informative and entertaining book to anyone with an interest in cattle ranching and cowboys.ook to anyone with an interest in cattle ranching and cowboys.	2003-08-17
US	51205644	R6FY8JS563JCN	1559211423	266527675	The Book of Ebenezer Le Page	Books	5	58	59	N	N	A big-hearted novel about a little-known time and place	I have long had a fascination for islands and count among my memorable experiences times spent on them and meeting the people who live there. It often amazes me how the geography of these small areas of land surrounded by open sea can expand in the minds of island residents to seem much larger than they in fact are. This psychological phenomenon must be due in part to the density of memory and history compacted within such confining natural boundaries.<br />G.B. Edwards' novel captures exactly that experience. It takes place on Guernsey, an English-speaking island with French cultural roots, and it embraces in its many pages the lifetime of one man. Born into the attitudes and values of the Victorian era, he's a very singular man, living alone, often cranky and difficult but his heart filled with yearning. His whole life has been transfigured by a boyhood adventure that leaves him stranded at high tide with a dearly loved friend on a chunk of rock offshore.<br />The island confinement is intensified in the years of German occupation during World War II. This seldom-told chapter of British history is depicted with absorbing detail and considerable suspense, as diminishing supplies of food and fuel, the constant threat of harsh treatment by the occupiers, and the sense of being \\"abandoned\\" by the British government make resistance difficult.<br />Like others who have written reviews here, I was enthralled by this big, well written book and was reluctant to see it end. I heartily recommend it as both an engaging story with a rich cast of vividly drawn characters and a window into a time and place that are little known to the rest of the world.	2003-08-16

It's also very much a mid-century view by an American author, somewhat still under the literary shadow of Faulkner, as well as the shadow of the Bomb. The characters are Nebraska-born and only vaguely aware that the world they grew up in no longer exists. Frontier violence long a thing of the past for them, they are troubled by the reemergence of violence in their midst -- particularly the killing spree of a young man (based loosely on Charles Starkweather), who murders 10 people before he is captured, and a high school student who runs down two others because he's &quot;tired of being pushed around.&quot;<br />The book is told from the point of view of 10 characters, most of whom are members of an extended family who gather to observe the 90th birthday of the family patriarch. Born when the West was first settled, he has lived his whole life in a hotel along the railroad tracks of a prairie town, Lone Tree, which like the tree it's named after has been dead for many years. The old man is the only resident. His three grown daughters, their husbands, and offspring are joined by a boyhood friend of theirs and a young woman he has met along the road. They bicker, bring up old grievances, and carry on in their idiosyncracies like a cast of characters in a farcical 1950s sitcom.<br />Almost plotless, the novel interweaves the characters' various obsessions, revealed in their almost aimless conversations, quirky behavior, and the time-worn grooves of thought in their respective streams of consciousness. Morris, meanwhile, touches on many themes, a central one being the struggle to maintain hope in a world where so many events, large and small, discourage it. After converging for a day and moonlit night in this ghost town once full of frontier promise of growth and prosperity, the characters climb aboard a moth-eaten covered wagon and strike off westward to who knows what promised land.<br />Readers of contemporary authors like William Styron and Richard Yates will find a familiar resonance in this densely written, closely observed, slow-paced novel. I recommend it to anyone interested in America's postwar generation of writers who, like Jack Kerouac, saw through the sunny surface of those often complacent years to the shadows underneath.o who knows what promised land.<br />Readers of contemporary authors like William Styron and Richard Yates will find a familiar resonance in this densely written, closely observed, slow-paced novel.

It's hard to summarize the contents of this collection because there's such an immense variety of images. In general, they are an often breathtaking tribute to the beauty of the western landscape. All but a few are of natural settings untouched by humans, and they represent the region of the U.S. west of the 105th meridian (which runs north and south through Denver). In most, also, there is an intensity of color and sharp contrast betwen light and shadow.<br />Beyond that, however, similarities pretty much end. Many pictures represent a very wide array of panoramic landscapes --  mountains, deserts, rivers, canyons, badlands, prairie, big sky. Others are closeups of plant life and the textures of surfaces (rock, sand, water). Some of these latter images verge on the abstract. The collection includes a sequence of photographs of the Colorado River's Glen Canyon in Utah in the early 1960s before its flooding to create Lake Powell. For a whole book devoted to Glen Canyon, see Porter's &quot;The Place No One Knew.&quot;<br />The introduction is a general overview of the history of this region that laments the loss of much since the introduction of European settlement and modernization and describes the struggle that has gone on for more than a century between preservationists and developers. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the American West.	2003-08-07

They are mostly landscapes, and while many are striking images, they're not intended as calendar art. Instead, they are a visual record of mountains, plains, and river valleys with literary and historical associations. There are the sites of massacres and battles: Little Big Horn, Wounded Knee, Sand River, Mountain Meadows, and the Chief Joseph Battlefield. And there are geographical points of reference for anyone who knows the West -- the headwaters of the Missouri River, the Black Hills, the Bighorns, Yellowstone River, the Big Blackfoot River, the Wind River, the Snake River, Independence Rock.<br />There is very little sign of humans crossing or inhabiting these landscapes. The exceptions are historical traces: petroglyphs of Native Americans, the marks of wagon wheels along the Oregon Trail, an abandoned church on open prairie, an inscription in rock left by &quot;Wm Clark&quot; in 1806.<br />The book honors Montana novelist A. B. Guthrie, who provides an essay with quotations from several of his books. There's also a brief tribute from Edward Abbey and a foreword by Charles Bowden. The book includes a sequence of photographs of other writers associated with the West: Wallace Stegner, Norman Maclean, Ivan Doig, Thomas McGuane, and James Welch. In an afterword, the photographer, Marc Gaede, tells a hair-raising and finally hilarious story of nearly losing A.B. Guthrie on a misadventure along the Marias River in northern Montana.<br />This is a great companion volume for readers of Montana literature and history. It portrays the natural environment that has inspired its best loved authors. And in many ways, it captures the land as Lewis and Clark would have seen it almost 200 years ago. For accounts of Chief Joseph and the Mountain Meadow Massacre in Utah, read Timothy Egan's &quot;Lasso the Wind.&quot; Another book with many points of connection is &quot;The Big Sky Reader.&quot;with many points of connection is &quot;The Big Sky Reader.&quot;	2003-08-06

This &quot;treasury&quot; of articles from the journal features a fair number of accounts of fishing and hunting, but if that's not your interest, there's more here to choose from. I particularly enjoyed Kim Zupan's reminiscences of riding in punkin roller rodeos, Ralph Beer's humorous essay on restoring a 1930s Montana State Highway Department snowplow, and Fred Haefele's mini-memoir of working as a timber faller. Laugh-out-loud hilarious is Jon Jackson's account of a 1972 cross-country trip with Raymond Carver in what turns out to be a stolen car.<br />A section on rivers includes Annick Smith's appreciation of the Big Blackfoot, the centerpiece of Norman Mclean's much-loved &quot;A River Runs Through It.&quot; Rick Bass captures that self-effacing, wonky pride of long-time Montana residents in his essay about a rain-soaked fishing trip on the Yaak River. John Barsness describes an archaeological dig along the Missouri River, unearthing the site of a fort that burned down in 1844.<br />The spirit of Edward Abbey also infuses the pages of this book. Doug Peacock (inspiration for the Monkey Wrench Gang's Hayduke) has a fishing essay, and Ralph Beer writes an &quot;apology&quot; for being once angered by Abbey's famous diatribe against ranching. I happily recommend this book for lovers of the outdoors and good writing and to anyone whose imagination is inspired by the mountains, prairies, and rivers of Big Sky country.	2003-08-06

Allard manages to use it with much broader intentions. He portrays not only the breadth and vastness of the Western landscape but the dust, dirt, and sweat of working with cattle and the irony of freedom when it's often just another word for nothing left to lose. If any book of Western photography captured the spirit of &quot;Bobby McGee,&quot; this one surely does.<br />There are about 100 photographs in this collection, taken in cowboy country from Mexico to Montana during the years 1965-1980. A few are landscapes; most are of cowboys, some Native Americans, a few women and children. Allard has also included photographs of a rural Hutterite community in Montana. There are rodeo pictures and scenes of roundup and of night-life, men either gathered around a campfire or hanging out in bars. There are many fine portrait shots of men, their faces showing the fatigue and the effects of weather and years of tobacco and hard drinking. Scattered through the book are pages devoted to brief profiles of men Allard has befriended, young and old. A brief foreword is provided by Montana novelist Thomas McGuane.<br />My favorite images start with a shadowy landscape of Wyoming, dark and moody, while a setting or rising sun throws golden light over a ridge line in the middle distance. Second favorite is a swath of snow-covered Montana prairie with a fence line leading away to what looks like abandoned buildings on the horizon. There's a handsome portrait of a Nevada cowboy, bearded, looking into the camera under the brim of his hat with soulful dark brown eyes. There's a back-pocket view of a row of nine cowboys sitting on the top rail of a rodeo arena fence.<br />Many photos are just plain quirky. Three women rodeo performers in brightly colored cowboy hats rub Vaseline over their teeth. A man stands with his arm around the shoulders of a smiling woman wearing woolly chaps, while behind them another man lies passed out on the ground. A cowboy in black Stetson and long yellow rain slicker bends with a pool cue to line up a shot across a smoky pool table. Sitting alone at the end of a long row of bar stools, lighted by a long shaft of afternoon light, a cowboy sits slack-jawed and staring, a can of Olympia between his legs.<br />I loved this book and happily recommend it. If you can find a copy, it goes nicely on a shelf of Western literature. As companion volumes, I'd recommend Douglas Kent Hall's &quot;Working Cowboys,&quot; Kendall Nelson's &quot;Gathering Remnants&quot; and a collection of vintage photographs, &quot;The American Cowboy.&quot;a smiling woman wearing woolly chaps, while behind them another man lies passed out on the ground.

Dykinga. Besides Arizona, locations include Mexico, Baja California, the shoreline of the Sea of Cortez, and Anza-Borrego and Joshua Tree National Monument in southern California.<br />There's no mistaking that it's a dry, hot region, but it's also clear that there is plant life almost everywhere. There are photographs of landscapes of sand, rock and sky, with saguaro, barrel cactus, ocotillo, and many desert flowers. There is not a sign of human life (until you reach the last half dozen pages where the editor has included several shots of blight: graffiti, a junkyard, a concrete water channel). Many photos are taken at sunrise or sundown, capturing glowing colors and shadows. A few are taken after snowfall.<br />The text, by Charles Bowden, is personal and impressionistic, with a Sierra Club point of view. He emphasizes the desert's resistance to any but the Native populations, who lived here in harmony with the landscape for millennia before the exploitation of European explorers. To these, in their crudest manifestations, are compared the more reckless schemes of modern-day developers. The closing chapter is an appreciation of wilderness advocate Edward Abbey. In  my opinion, an error on the part of the book designer was to set these long essays as full pages of italic type, which makes them difficult to read.<br />As a companion volume, I recommend Joseph Wood Krutch's &quot;Desert Year,&quot; an account of a year spent in the Sonoran desert near Tucson.

Michael Allen is a folklorist and a rodeo fan. He's a Westerner, born and raised in Ellensburg in central Washington. When this book was published, he was on the faculty of the University of Washington -- probably still is. I say all this because his book is first of all an academic discussion of his subject. It's based on extensive reading and field research, and the analysis tackles a broad range of topics that comprise the discourse among a couple generations of folklorists who've focused on the culture of western Americana. In other words, while Allen clearly enjoys his subject, he's making arguments directed at fellow professionals who represent different points of view. Because of this, there's a steady flow of documentation, with plenty of footnotes. For the casual reader, all this may get a little heavy-going at times.<br />Allen covers many facets of his subject -- starting with the history of rodeo and looking at the rodeo cowboy as portrayed in movies and TV, folklore, literature, art, and country music. He also has a chapter on what he calls \\"rainbow rodeo riders\\" -- that is, minorities, such as Native Americans, African-Americans, women, gays and lesbians. There's also a glossary of rodeo cowboy lingo and a long annotated bibliography in the form of an essay.<br />Allen's argument rests on a couple of ideas that he acknowledges are debatable. The first is that \\"real cowboys\\" (as they existed over 100 years ago out on the unfenced Plains) are for the most part a thing of the past. Today, the role of the \\"real cowboy\\" is left to the rodeo cowboy, and (this is where I'd take exception) Allen pretty much ignores the host of working cowboys who still make a living on ranches in a dozen or more western states. But I'm not a folklorist, so that's just my nonprofessional opinion.<br />The other idea is that the rodeo cowboy represents a \\"contemporary ancestor\\" for modern-day Americans. He harks back to the American frontier of our imagination. In his risk-defiant, untamed, wandering, individualistic behavior, he represents what fans regard as essentially American in themselves. In other words, he's mythic -- he represents our deepest values and connects us with our past. These values are embraced by the Cowboy Code, which is an unwritten set of behavioral guidelines all men must aspire to if they are to be accepted into the elite fraternity of \\"real cowboys.\\" Dating from cowboy culture as it took form in the 19th century, the Code survives today, apparently stronger than ever among the men who rodeo.<br />The irony is that Allen also reveals the dark side of the myth and the Code, for both thrive on a kind of extreme libertarianism that can be anti-social, intolerant, and misogynistic. While the cowboy with his six-gun \\"tamed\\" the West (in popular fiction and movies, at least), the archetypal cowboy is untamable himself. While that's part of his appeal (and there are popular outlaw cowboys aplenty, e.g., Billy the Kid), it also exposes the rodeo cowboy's unsavory side. Allen may not intend this, but this casts a shadow over his argument.<br />For all my reservations, I recommend this book. It's so full of ideas and ranges across more rodeo cowboy literature than I ever imagined existed. He's added several titles to my reading list. As companion volumes, I'd recommend Baxter Black's hilarious rodeo novel, \\"Hey, Cowboy, Wanna Get Lucky?\\" A great book of essays and rodeo photography can be found in Bob St. John's \\"On Down the Road,\\" full of interviews with rodeo stars circa 1975.

I was immediately drawn in (and by a subject that is not of more than general interest to me), and I more or less did not put the book down until I'd read to the last page.<br />As a teacher, I'm first of all impressed by how McPhee makes an academic and scientific subject (geology) not just interesting but gripping. For the most part, he personalizes it, introducing an eminent field geologist, David Love, who takes him and us on a tour around Love's home-state, Wyoming, describing over 2 billion years of the geological past as revealed in the cuts along Interstate 80 and in a side trip to Jackson Hole, outside Yellowstone Park. Love is very much a product of his upbringing on an isolated ranch in central Wyoming, his mother educated at Wellesley, his father an immigrant from Scotland who quotes William Cowper and Sir Walter Scott.<br />Love is independent, old school, hands-on, tireless, scrupulous, an innovative thinker who has made a significant impact over a lifetime in his field, choosing to work for the US Geological Survey after a short period of unhappy employment for an oil company. McPhee captures his very individual point of view, his dedication to science, and his Western perspective in character sketches and fragments of conversation between them. He has a dry sense of humor, colorful turns of phrase, and a toughness that goes along with long periods of field work and sleeping rough under the stars. He's also a grand-nephew of John Muir.<br />The book actually begins with his mother's wintery journey by horse-drawn coach from Rawlins to central Wyoming, where she has accepted a teaching job at a one-room school. It segues between the story of his parents' courtship in the first decade of the 20th century and his travels with McPhee over 70 years later, finally devoting a long section to Love's own boyhood, growing up on his parents' ranch, with an older brother, among cowboys raising both sheep and cattle. The accounts of surviving blizzards and floods that nearly wipe them out, the visitors passing through who may or may not be hunted killers, even an appearance (possibly two) by Butch Cassidy make this compelling reading for anyone with an interest in the early days of ranching in the West.<br />There's a brilliant section late in the book as McPhee describes Love's fascination with Jackson Hole while he's still a graduate student at Yale, and after many years of walking the ridges and summits around it, developing a scenario of how it was formed over the eons. McPhee's rendering of this scenario in words is vivid, and in the mind's eye, you can see mountain ranges and seas rise and fall in all manner of climates from tropical to ice age, until the topography assumes its present configuration, which is still changing.<br />I highly recommend this book. As companion volumes, I also recommend Loren Eiseley's memoir \\"All the Strange Hours,\\" Geoffrey O'Gara's book about water rights in the Wind River basin, \\"What You See in Clear Water,\\" and James Galvin's novel, \\"Fencing the Sky,\\" in which a modern-day cowboy fugitive travels much of this same terrain on horseback.ther, among cowboys raising both sheep and cattle.

Egan is something of a gonzo journalist, taking on the vast subject of the American West and finding in it cause for both wonder and humor. The book is a collection of 14 essays, in which the author travels to places in 11 different states, giving readers plenty of local history, descriptions of dramatic landscapes, and a portrayal of \\"custom and culture\\" that reels under colliding visions of what the West should be. At every turn, he has an eye for ironies that both reveal and entertain.<br />After an introduction that takes place at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he begins his journey in New Mexico and Arizona, then moves northward, swinging through Colorado, Montana, and the Great Basin states, ending in California. There is much about cowboys, cattlemen, and Native Americans. We also visit London Bridge at Lake Havasu, an ostrich ranch outside Denver, the pit left behind by the Anaconda copper mining company in Butte, the casinos of Las Vegas, and the site of an appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe on the back of a road sign in Sunnyside, Washington. There are accounts of fishing in the Bitterroots of Idaho, river rafting on the American River above Sacramento, and hunting for Anasazi petroglyphs in the canyons of the Escalante in Utah.<br />Meanwhile history comes alive from a colorful and sometimes jaundiced perspective in stories of the conquistador Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate's conquest of the Indians at Acoma in New Mexico, the massacre of a wagon train of settlers by Mormons at Mountain Meadows, Utah, in the 1860s, and the California Gold Rush. There are historical figures who make vivid appearances, including Theodore Roosevelt, John Muir, Lewis and Clark, and Brigham Young. The most affecting story is the author's retelling of Chief Joseph and the fate of the Nez Perce.<br />Egan gives us a whirlwind trip across a vast area of the U.S. He touches on themes that are common in books about the west -- the follies and vanities of those who have defied the realities of its arid climate, laid waste to natural resources, decimated its wildlife, and attempted to eradicate its native populations. While there is much to lament in what it reveals of the devastation brought by settlement of the West, it also seeks earnestly for signs that the spirit of the West still survives and can eventually thrive.<br />I highly recommend this book as an addition to any bookshelf of Western nonfiction. As a companion volume, I also recommend Frank Clifford's \\"The Backbone of the World,\\" which recounts a similar journey by a journalist across the states that lie along the Continental Divide.in books about the west -- the follies and vanities of those who have defied the realities of its arid climate, laid waste to natural resources, decimated its wildlife, and attempted to eradicate its native populations.

There are photos taken by seven photographers, the earliest of them William Henry Jackson (1843-1942) traveling with a scientific expedition and working with cumbersome equipment and 11x14 wet glass negatives.<br />The bios of all seven of these men recount the lives of 19th and early 20th century adventurers, intrepid trekkers across the wilderness and frontier to make a visual record of the West during its early years of settlement. Their images are joined by those of scores of amateur photographers, whose snapshots were collected for this edition and fill many of the pages of the book.<br />The book is organized by various themes, from rodeo (see cover) to farming and ranching, communities, dudes, hunting, and so on. An interesting sequence captures a landslide which blocked the Snake River for 2 years in the 1920s and then gave way, causing a flood that inundated the valley, wiping out the town of Kelly. Another sequence illustrates the years of change at Teton Pass, the only winter access to the valley, transport progressing from horses to automobiles.<br />Lest we think of this as entirely a man's world, there's a photo of the all-woman town council of Jackson, the first U.S. town to be governed entirely by women (1920-1924). There are photos of the first aeroplane landing, winter dog sled racing, and the environmental devastation caused by the damming of Lake Jackson. Photos record the vists of European royalty and the John D. Rockefellers, whose influence and money helped create Grand Teton National Park.<br />For lovers of the Old West and old photographs, the images reproduced here are a rich treasure. From significant and historic events to everyday life, the book is a picture album of Americana. I also recommend another excellent collection of old Western photographs in Richard Collins' &quot;The American Cowboy.&quot;raphs in Richard Collins' &quot;The American Cowboy.&quot;	2003-07-24

Reading the reviews and the dust jacket, you can get the idea that this is a book about a book club. For this reader, it is more directly about the impact of the Islamic revolution on the lives of educated women in Iran. There women are required at the risk of their lives to wear the \\"veil,\\" which symbolizes the surrender of their independence to a government that uses fear and intimidation to control them and, in the words of the author, make them \\"irrelevant.\\"<br />The author, now living in the US, tells of almost two decades in Iran, as a teacher of English and American literature. She tells of the great hopes for reform after the fall of the Shah and the return from exile of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and with her we watch in horror as the revolution takes Iran by force instead into its medieval past. There are arrests, murders, and executions and those who can, flee to the West. The transformation of Iran is charted by the repressive attempts to make women invisible, by covering them in public from head to toe. It becomes a world in which wearing fingernail polish, even under gloves, is a punishable offense. And punishment, as we learn, is typically brutal.<br />The author escapes from this violence into the imaginative world of Western novels (from Nabokov to Dashiell Hammet) where she finds democratic ideals expressed in fiction's ability to help us empathize with other people. For her, it is the heart that has gone out of the gun-wielding moral police that want to sweep away all but complete submission to their fundamentalist form of Islam. And while she is a teacher, she must deal with classes filled with students who have been polarized by the political forces around them. All, curiously, are in single agreement that the West is corrupt and absolutely evil. Meanwhile, the novels of Western writers engage them, sometimes furiously. A wonderful sequence in the book concerns a mock trial in the classroom in which \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is brought up on charges of immorality.<br />\\"Lolita,\\" we discover, becomes a story of a girl who finally escapes from the clutches of a man who wants to erase who she is and turn her into a figment of his imagination. It's not an allegory of Iran, Nafisi insists, but it's hard not to see the parallels. The contamination of personal relationships between men and women and its impact on love and marriage inform their readings of James and Austen. Meanwhile, even as her classes meet to argue the merits of these authors, their books are disappearing as one bookstore after another is closed down.<br />Added to all this is an account of living through eight years of war with Iraq, while missiles fall on Tehran and the numbers of casualties on the front lines mount. After leaving teaching, the author assembles a hand-picked group of former students, all female, to meet weekly at her home and talk more about books. Here the individual personalities and histories of each come to the fore, and we get a glimpse (as in fiction) into personal worlds experienced intensely under circumstances that have nearly robbed them of their identities.<br />It's easy to go on and on about this book. There is so much packed into it. Needless to say, I recommend it highly, especially to anyone who loves books or has taught literature. Obviously, it also informs many gender issues. For male readers, such as myself, it is like an extended version of Virginia Woolf's illuminating \\"A Room of One's Own.\\" The author and her young students show how the lives of both men and women are impoverished in a world where one sex attempts to assume control over the other. For me, the book is best summed up in the author's words near the end: \\"Living in the Islamic Republic is like having sex with a man you loathe.\\"<br />The books is not a polemic, and as the author would be first to admit, there are many other voices to be heard on the subject of Iran, its government, and its role in the world. For this reader, her book opens a door intoa complex subject that invites one to read more and know more.a complex subject that invites one to read more and know more.	2003-07-21

Settling near Missoula, Montana, in 1964, Smith was married to a university teacher and hopeful film writer, who died of heart failure, leaving her with four young sons. Adopting Montana as a home, she writes about the 163-acre \\"homestead\\" of the book's title, raising her sons and entertaining friends in a log house transported there from where it had been abandoned on a property 30 miles upriver.<br />Actually, a river runs through this book. It's the Big Blackfoot River, the same one that figures in Norman Mclean's story about fly fishing and family. Maclean, in fact, lives close by, and she comes to know him, eventually becoming a guiding force behind the film adaptation. (She shares credits as co-producer with fellow writer and friend Bill Kittredge, and the film's director, Robert Redford. She has also produced the film \\"Heartland,\\" set in frontier Montana. Her twin sons Alec and Andrew have become filmmakers in their own right, writing and directing \\"The Slaughter Rule,\\" also set in Montana.)<br />Smith's book meanders casually across a variety of topics. There are accounts of the Montana seasons, a local band called the Mudflaps, the work of brand inspectors, her Hungarian Jewish parents who live in Chicago, summers with her two young sisters on the Michigan shore of Lake Michigan, travels to Spain and Alaska, fishing and hiking, celebrity friends, family gatherings on holidays, Montana wildlife, the Nez Perce, and the environmental impact of mining and clear cutting.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Montana, the outdoors, Western living, and a certain 1960s spirit that survives among the graying hippies who once fled into what was then the wilderness. I also recommend Gretel Ehrlich's \\"The Solace of Open Spaces,\\" about a California filmmaker who visits Wyoming and decides to stay.	2003-07-14

It illustrates his evolution from minimalist to representative styles, rich with strong colors, his latter works revealing a masterful grasp of space and light. Unlike painters like Maynard Dixon, who loved to work directly in remote locations on the Colorado Plateau, Mell works in his Phoenix studio. To capture the look and feel of his desert vistas, he uses photography from the vantage point of a helicopter. The resulting paintings are imaginative composites of the land forms and clouds recorded on film, and the above-ground perspective heightens awareness of depth, space, distances and the curvature of the earth.<br />As of this writing, Hagerty's book is out of print (he has also written a biography of Maynard Dixon, &quot;Desert Dreams&quot;). If you can acquire a copy, it will reward you with 100 pages of vivid reproductions, including photographs of Mell's whimsical cowboy sculpture, &quot;Jack Knife&quot; and &quot;Diggin' In.&quot; Hagerty shows how Mell works, illustrating the stages of a painting's development. There is also a chapter-length biography of the artist, with family snapshots and a few examples of his early commercial work.	2003-07-13

A prolific writer who stayed close to home was Mari Sandoz, born of a Swiss-German homesteader in the northwest Nebraska Panhandle in 1896. Her biography of her father, \\"Old Jules,\\" made her suddenly famous in 1935 when she was nearly 40 years old.<br />Sandoz knew the frontier from firsthand experience, and although her tyrranical father prevented her from earning more than an 8th grade education, she became a tireless researcher of the turbulent period of confrontation between whites and Indians. Inheriting a deep respect for Native Americans from her father, she represents them sympathetically in her best known histories, \\"Crazy Horse\\" (1942) and \\"Cheyenne Autumn\\" (1953). She also wrote novels and many short stories, some works published after her death in 1966.<br />\\"Old Jules Country\\" is a selection of nonfiction writings from several of her books, plus a few shorter essays. Readers today may have trouble with her historical work, as Sandoz writes from the point of view of the people she's writing about. So to a modern reader, the frame of reference is not always clear. Although her work is based on extensive research, the style reads more like historical fiction. For some, this will make the material more accessible; for those looking for historical accuracy it will add an element of ambiguity.<br />Still, with patience, a reader can begin to glean a great deal about Indians during the years of the frontier and quickly discover the limitations of stereotypes and cliches that dominate our meager understanding of \\"how the West was won.\\" The essay \\"The Lost Sitting Bull,\\" for instance, explores some of the political differences among the tribes in their dealings with the government and the military, and for the general  reader it opens a wide window into a largely forgotten history.<br />More accessible are her personal memories of her father, as told in \\"Old Jules,\\" and of growing up in the Nebraska sandhills along the Niobrara River. \\"The Homestead in Perspective\\" presents a personalized picture of staking a claim in the prairie sod and the odds against making a go of it. The essays \\"Snakes\\" and \\"Coyotes and Eagles\\" reveal more of the day-to-day realities of frontier life. For readers of modern memoirs, these essays will seem more familiar in their structuring of incident, choice of detail, and personal disclosure.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with some knowledge of the high plains frontier, its settlement, and its history. It is a good introduction to the nonfiction of Mari Sandoz, and a reader will be drawn to read more from the individual books excerpted here.

Here's another one. If you can get your hands on a copy somewhere, hang onto it. The photographer, David Plowden, has a wonderful sensitivity for the vast sweep of this landscape and the big sky. While there are a few 2-page spreads that reach for the breadth of spaces on the open plains, most of the photos are square or very nearly so, and Plowden is a master of images framed in these proportions.<br />For example, a photograph taken in what looks like late afternoon captures a deserted dirt street in Carter, Montana. Stretching straight ahead to the edge of town, the street is wide as the bottom frame of the picture and in the course of two blocks quickly narrows, then ends, and beyond in the middle distance to the blue, range of far-off mountains are gently rolling, golden fields, under a milky blue sky. The buildings on both sides of the street turn blank, windowless walls to the camera, and a white General Mills elevator rises above the rooflines. Beside it stands the criss-crossed arms of a railroad crossing sign. Along the street there are utility poles and wires running overhead. In the foreground the street has been oiled to settle the dust, and grass grows right to the edges. There's not a sign of human life. The picture evokes a vast open stillness and an air of time suspended.<br />The photographs were shot during 1970-71 across all of the Great Plains states from Montana south to New Mexico and Texas. There's a great variety of images impossible to summarize here, including white markers in the grass of the Little Big Horn, a full moon over bluffs, sunsets, abandoned farm buildings, vacant store fronts, cars and trucks parked in front of a bar, wheat fields, hay fields, windmills, an old tractor, railroad tracks, an endless freight train, riverbeds and dry water holes, stormy skies, badlands, the faces of rural people, and the backside of one cowboy sitting on the top rail of a fence. Plowden has caught the Great Plains in all kinds of moods and conditions, and the images just take your breath away.<br />The book also has a considerable amount of text. Being a Sierra Club publication, there is a sense of both loss and anger at the failure of humans to be more respectful of the earth. A section called &quot;The Short grass and the big sky&quot; describes the terrain, climate, plant and animal life. A longer section follows called &quot;The way it was when the way was west,&quot; providing a history of the area's immigrants, beginning with the Spanish. The final section, &quot;The way it is,&quot; describes life on the Great Plains as Plowden found it in 1970-71, and the book introduces several people he talked to, including farmers and ranchers.<br />The photographs are mostly color; some are black and white. The title is from Willa Cather, who described the Great Plains as &quot;the floor of the sky.&quot; I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in this part of the American West. Plowden has a wonderful eye and clearly a fascination for what he discovered here in his travels across the flat and rolling landscapes.ght the Great Plains in all kinds of moods and conditions, and the images just take your breath away. <br />The book also has a considerable amount of text.

Throughout, it is humorous; at times it is laugh-out-loud funny.<br />The title comes from a Huck Finn-inspired attempt to float down the Platte River on an inner tube raft with another boy, an adventure somewhat diminished by the shallow river's lack of water and a tumultuous thunderstorm that drives them to a motel. The book begins and ends with accounts of the extended families from which both of his parents spring -- the Tuppers of Red Cloud (Willa Cather country) and the Joneses of little Magnet in northeast Nebraska.<br />The rest is a vivid evocation of a small-town boyhood set mostly in the western Panhandle town of Chappell, Nebraska. For a boy who owns BB guns, loves elaborate pranks, and plays baseball, it's a town of lazy summers, cranky neighbors, vicious school teachers, incompetent town cops, and various oddball residents. Although he does not make much of this, he is the proverbial preacher's son, always riding the ragged edge of disaster.<br />There are a few sobering moments in the mix, as when he pauses in a recollection of the early 1950s polio outbreaks to tell of two young survivors. But for the most part, Jones is eagerly looking for the comic turns in his stories, the ironies and absurdities. He manages this by lapsing into the frame of mind he seems to have had as a boy, irrepressible, heedless, and almost totally self-centered.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who has ever loved Huck Finn. It takes its rightful place on a bookshelf of American small-town childhoods. As companion volumes, I'd recommend Roger Welsch's humorous \\"It's Not the End of the Earth But You Can See It From Here,\\" about the goings on in another Nebraska small town, Dannebrog, as well as Willie Morris' memoir of growing up in Yazoo City, Mississippi, \\"My Dog Skip.\\"	2003-07-05

It's a big oversize book, with 48 black and white plates by California photographer Kendall Nelson. The rather worshipful and romantic text is by German-born writer Felicitas Funke-Riehle. Gretel Ehrlich has provided an introduction about the lonely, hard work of a cowboy, written in her own meticulous eye-for-detail style. (Clint Eastwood has a brief 5-sentence foreword.)<br />The photos were taken 1996-1999 on several ranches in Nevada, with some additional shots taken in Texas, Wyoming, and Idaho. Most of them are of individual cowboys, many with their horses. Typically they are captured against a sweeping terrain under a big sky with scattered clouds. A buckaroo gathers sage brush for a branding fire. Another sits in the open flap of a teepee tent bent over a silver bit he's repairing, Four vaqueros sit in the shade against a wall, smoking cigarettes, the oldest of them watching the photographer.<br />Cowboys move cattle through sage brush, raising clouds of dust. A cowboss stands with his wife and son against the plank walls of a shed, their three border collies gathered at their feet. A man leans, head down against a fence, snow collecting on the brim of his hat. The photographs capture the relentless, hard work of these men and something of their solitude. Even as they wait for their horses (see cover photograph) they stand separately, keeping a distance between them. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in cowboys, cattle ranching, Western life, and thoughtful photography. For vintage photographs of cowboys, I suggest also Richard Collins' &quot;The American Cowboy.&quot;	2003-07-02

Goetzmann's &quot;The West of the Imagination,&quot; a book about how America's picture of the Western frontier was shaped by early painters, illustrators, filmmakers and wild west shows. Born in 1875, Dixon stepped into a tradition defined by Charles Russell and Frederic Remington, but his portrayal of Western scenes falls somewhat closer in style and attitude to an eastern contemporary, Edward Hopper. His paintings of the Southwest are about the vast landscapes and the big sky, open spaces of color, light, and sharply contrasting shadow. Human figures are often absent or dwarfed by the scale of mountain and desert.<br />This book was assembled to accompany an exhibition at BYU, which has a large collection of Dixon's paintings, acquired from the artist in the 1930s by the University. There are a great many color plates and related black and white photographs, and the authors have provided an extensive written commentary describing Dixon's career, his work, and his relationship with the young photographer Dorothea Lange, to whom he was married 1920-1934. A central chapter in the book concerns his paintings of Native Americans, whom he ennobled while at the same time turning away from the conditions of poverty, desperation and government oppression in which they lived.<br />Lange emerged as a documentary photographer in the early years of the Depression, photographing the growing labor unrest and the unemployed that filled the streets of San Francisco. Returning from the &quot;reality&quot; that he preferred in the desert Southwest, Dixon joined her in creating a series of paintings portraying these same themes, concentrating on the dark, despairing, and often violent struggle between the out-of-work and the police. The book gives side-by-side examples of her photographs and his paintings from this period.<br />The book does not provide a comprehensive study of Dixon. While he denegrated his work as a commercial illustrator, it would be interesting to see his style and treatment of Western subject matter in that medium by contrast with his &quot;artistic&quot; work.

This responsibility takes only minutes out of each day; the rest of the time is his own, and what this gregarious, impulsive, party-loving 20-year-old does with seven months of isolation in the wilderness is the central theme of this book.<br />Fromm makes clear from the outset that he's almost utterly unprepared for this experience, with little guiding him but a fascination for the rugged, self-sufficient mountain men whose adventures he has read about. Packing a couple books on outdoor survival, he plans to figure it out as he goes, and given a need to keep himself busy and his mind off the isolation, he acquires a range of on-the-job skills, from operating a chain saw, to camp cooking, skinning animals, and curing meat. He also hunts for game, subsisting on grouse and squirrel until he amazingly (and illegally) bags a moose with a muzzle-loader.<br />In fact, Fromm is not entirely alone -- he has a dog as a constant companion -- and there is a trickle of visitors throughout the winter. Besides the occasional visit by the wardens, who bring mail and packages, there are hunters and their guides who trek in on snowmobiles (snowmachines, as he learns to call them). Welcoming the company -- and curious -- he goes along on hunts, witnessing the shooting of a mountain lion.<br />There are some disappointments. His father and brother travel from Milwaukee and attempt to ski in but are turned back by cold and bad trail conditions. A planned &quot;vacation&quot; with friends in Missoula has to be cancelled when snowslides make access difficult. He consoles himself after killing and skinning an injured bobcat that he wouldn't have had this experience if he hadn't been on his own.<br />The book invites comparison with C. L. Rawlins' &quot;Broken Country,&quot; in which the author recalls a college-boy summer as a cook and horse wrangler for a sheepherder in the mountains of western Wyoming. A reader will also be reminded at times of Edward Abbey's youthful &quot;Desert Solitaire.&quot;All exhibit a willingness to abandon themselves to adventure without considerable forethought, but there's a relative lack of reflectiveness on the part of Fromm, who is able to report straightforwardly what he observes but tends to avoid making connections to the ideas of other people or to think deeply or critcally about his experience. This makes the book more of a page-turner; you rarely put it down to let something he's written soak in.<br />In the end, you forgive him his youth, give him credit for surviving (there are some close calls that may have turned his story into another &quot;Into the Wild&quot;), and appreciate the clean, clear style and the ability to create and maintain suspense (for example when his father and brother fail to arrive). I'm happy to recommend it to anyone with an interest in Western nonfiction, wilderness adventures and the psychological aspects of isolation.t; in which the author recalls a college-boy summer as a cook and horse wrangler for a sheepherder in the mountains of western Wyoming.

Most of the photographs chosen for this book date from 1885 into the first decades of the 20th century, with a few as recent as the 1930s.<br />Besides herding, driving, and working cattle and horses, which have become familiar images over the years, the editor has included shots of meal-time and preparation of food at the chuckwagon. Some of these are nights shots, lighted by the campfire.<br />There are shots of cowboys with fiddles and guitars, one a younger man on a cot in a cabin, the photograph rich with details: the layers of worn blankets on the cot, the cowboy's big white hat, the two shirts he's wearing, the cuffs of his jeans turned up, two pairs of boots (the more beat-up pair shoved against one corner of the cot), a towel hanging against the log wall behind him, and a copy of Liberty magazine lying open on a seat in the foreground.<br />There are cowboys on horseback performing the remarkable trick of drinking water from their hat brims. (One of these is on the cover.) There are many groups shots of men lined up to face the camera. Two of them from early 1880s Montana show artist and writer Charles Russell. Another shows over 30 men at a cowboy's funeral, hats off, standing around a patch of freshly turned prairie sod, two of them holding shovels.<br />A group of ten trail cowboys from the XIT ranch sit for a portrait shot, two with revolvers drawn in their laps, each of them dressed very differently. There are two studio portraits of individual cowboys from the 1890s, one of them with long, shoulder-length hair, the other a fresh-faced youth, with silk scarf, woolly chaps, leather gloves with wide cuffs, gunbelt, and a monogrammed shirt with big medallion buttons.<br />There are a few shots of cowboying in winter, taken in the 1920s and 30s. In one remarkable two-page spread, a cowboy on his horse watches a long, long line of Herefords moving across a landscape totally whited out by snow.  Also interesting are shots of early ranch houses and cow camp cabins, one of them against the eroded rocks of the Missouri Breaks.<br />The opening essay by Bob Edgar, curator of The Museum of the Old West, Cody, Wyoming, gives a general overview of the period, focusing on the cattle drives and talking briefly about the career of one dedicated photographer, Charles Belden. For more of a historical background to go with the photographs, there is Andy Adams' \\"Log of a Cowboy,\\" \\"Cowboy Life\\" by William Savage, Jr., Ramon Adams' book about chuckwagons and the camp cook \\"Come an' Get It,\\" and Larry McMurtry's novel \\"Lonesome Dove.\\" For another book of vintage photographs of the Old West, look at \\"The Early Days in Jackson Hole\\" by Virginia Huidekoper.o-page spread, a cowboy on his horse watches a long, long line of Herefords moving across a landscape totally whited out by snow.

US	51205644	R2WBUZVMW68PCO	0030704189	561683911	Working Cowboys	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Cowboy UP!	Douglas Kent Hall has a way of capturing the work and the manner of real cowboys that makes this book both a terrific photo album and a well-written description of these men and the world they work in. Hall snaps many shots of branding, roping, bronc riding, and working cattle, but the best photos are the full-length portrait shots of cowboys standing or leaning against a door frame or fence, having their pictures taken. They look into the camera, with a serious expression, portraying visually the stoic-romantic, cowboy-up way they are recorded in the words of Hall's text.<br />Hall sees them and describes them in the way they see themselves. Hard-working, often silent, resigned to the conditions of an occupation that pays little but gives them pride, self-reliance, and a belief that they stand for a way of life superior to any other. They are both fiercely independent individuals and members of a fraternity with a strict code of behavior and values. Given the opportunity, they may complain about less-than-perfect conditions of employment, and they're ambivalent about the modernization of ranching, yearning for the good old days before attempts to mechanize the business of raising and working cattle changed the nature of the work they love.<br />Hall has a great eye for detail both in his images and in his text. He wants you to see the way cowboys individualize and put their own stamp on the universal uniform of hat, boots, jeans, and shirt. By putting photos of young and old cowboys together on the page, he also wants you to see the toll that this kind of work takes on their bodies and physical features. His descriptions in prose are also rich with details as he describes the predawn rituals of saddling up, or the ambiance of sitting in front of a fire in a camp house without electricity, or a long ride over rough rangeland in a pickup, which eventually gets stuck. He also seems to have recorded and transcribed his interviews with cowboys, because the text is realistically rich with their turns of phrase and their long ramblings on various subjects.<br />The author has considerable credits, including the scripting of &quot;The Great American Cowboy,&quot; a documentary which won an Academy Award in 1974. As of this writing, this wonderful book is out of print. If you can find a copy, get one and hang onto it. It's a gem.

US	51205644	R13AOP4X4CI9MP	0802805116	545873569	The Cost of Moral Leadership: The Spirituality of Dietrich Bonhoeffer	Books	5	18	18	N	N	A man of steadfast faith in perilous times	I am writing as a layman, interested in Bonhoeffer's story ever since discovering his \\"Letters and Papers From Prison,\\" which moved me deeply when I first read it more than a decade ago. I spent much of a year attempting to translate that book into a full-length play, and in the process became more familiar with it, eventually concluding that for a lay audience, his story is too ineffably sad. After a couple of readings, I put it away. I understand that there has been a growing outpouring of scholarship devoted to Bonhoeffer in the years since then, and this book has been my first encounter with it. Having said all that, I'd like to express my appreciation to the authors for their effort to shed a new, welcome light on Bonhoeffer's life and work.<br />In a world and at a time when movie stars and new age advocates speak easily of \\"spirituality,\\" it was brave for the authors to characterize their perspective on Bonhoeffer with this word. While admitting in the introduction that they could not settle on a definition of the term themselves, they proceed to discuss the various aspects of Bonhoeffer's life, actions, and faith in terms of his devotion to Jesus Christ. In exploring the evidence of his living faith, in word and deed, they represent Bonhoeffer as an example of moral leadership in a specific time and place in human history. And the result is to make this somewhat enigmatic man and his ideas more accessible for us today.<br />What comes across for me most strongly in the book is how much Bonhoeffer's writings and actions were a direct response to the Nazi government and the acquiesence of the German Lutheran Church. The issues that drive what he has to say reflect specific actions and policies of the government and the inaction of the church, which allowed its authority to be coopted by Hitler and the rising tide of German nationalism. The concept of \\"cheap grace\\" in \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\" is not an abstraction but a direct reference to the church's real lack of moral leadership at a time when resistance to the Nazi regime was most needed.<br />The book portrays the personal drama of a man who kept his personal life very private (one cannot imagine him on a talk show discussing his \\"spirituality\\"). The authors give us glimpses of his private world in reports of those who remember him, but nowhere is the private man seen so openly as in his intimate letters to Bethge and in the prison poems, which the authors devote the last chapter to. Here we find both the tentativeness behind his outward courage and the depth of his devotion to his chief source of strength. I have found this book very readable and recommend it to anyone with a basic knowledge of Bonhoeffer and a curiosity about how this man lived out his faith and remained steadfast to the end.ack of moral leadership at a time when resistance to the Nazi regime was most needed.<br />The book portrays the personal drama of a man who kept his personal life very private (one cannot imagine him on a talk show discussing his \\"spirituality\\").

In this one of his many books, he describes the role of the chuck wagon cook on the cattle drives and roundups. Adams is a great collector of amusing stories and colorful cowboy slang. If he knows one word for something, he probably knows half a dozen.<br />The book provides a detailed description of the chuck wagon itself, how it's constructed and its contents organized, how it's cleaned and maintained, who has responsibilities for what. The chuck wagon was both the nerve center and social center of a trail outfit. Besides getting three meals a day, the cowboys also laid out their bedrolls nearby, and the wrangler's remuda of horses was close at hand. In many cases, the cowboys' bedrolls made the trip to the next night's camp in the back of the chuck wagon.<br />Of most interest to this reader was the actual fare, typically fried meat, beans cooked for many hours, and sourdough biscuits made in Dutch ovens, all washed down with strong coffee. Depending on the talent and disposition of the cook there were also treats and &quot;sweets,&quot; such as pies made from dried apples. An outfit depended for morale and productivity on a cook who kept the men well fed and happy. This gave a well-liked cook a tremendous amount of leverage in the all-male hierarchy of tough cowboys. A man who complained about the chuck or didn't respect the cook's camp rules would soon be sorry.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and while I've read extensively about the cowboy West, it taught me a lot I didn't know, and in a very entertaining way. It belongs on anyone's &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; bookshelf.	2003-06-20

All are in richly captured color, and all manage to bring the panorama of this wide open country within the viewfinder of the still camera. Brown's achievement is to show the suggestive and telling details that transform these \\"empty\\" landscapes into spaces that are filled with drama and atmosphere.<br />A shot of winter prairie, south of Edgerton, Wyoming, reveals the contoured undulations of grasslands thick with frost, the banks of a shallow wash weaving into the distance, the horizon blending into the brightly overcast sky. The entire image seems sepia-tinted in the winter light. An early summer shot of ground water standing dark and rippled in a Nebraska Sandhills pond shows tufted grasses in the foreground leaning with the wind. A single slender fence post is echoed in the distance by a single tree in full leaf and just visible beyond it a windmill. The grass extends to the gently rolling horizon where a white thundercloud begins to pile upward into the vivid blue of a brightly sunlit sky.<br />Light, shadow, clouds, all seem still but are in movement, and many of the photographs heighten a sense of time's gradual passing -- the hour, the day, the season, the years. A roadside directory, indicating the distances to ranches has been weathered and sun-bleached. An old shingle-roofed elevator stands empty and overgrown with trees. There's a disused one-room school, white paint worn by wind and rain down to the bare boards. Tall weeds grow in the playground, and the setting sun casts the shadow of a swing set against a side wall.<br />And there are many signs of life, as well -- a general store with gas pumps and pop machines in front, a TV antenna overhead, and a gravel lot for parking; a barber shop with curving glass brick and shiny red tile facade, with an American flag on a pole at the curb; a last-picture-show cinema, the Rialto, with nothing on the marquee, but above it a wonderful mural of cowboys around the campfire and a chuckwagon with \\"Welcome to Brownville\\" on its canvas covering.<br />There are photographs of small town life -- a young man and little girl stand by the front door of a tiny house, the white siding bright in the late afternoon sun and a darkening sky behind them; a sign painter sits on the back of his truck under a hand-lettered sign, \\"Advertise Dammit Advertise Before We Both Go Under\\"; a floor-to-ceiling chalkboard is filled with for-sale notices for hay hauling, an early American sofa and matching swivel/rocker, a 3/4 ton Chev. 4x4, toy poodles, chow puppies, and a bird dog that \\"will point.\\"<br />And this really only scratches the surface. The photographs reveal themselves slowly, and with a patient and inquisitive eye, there is much to see in all of them. If you have lived in or traveled through this region, as I have, you will see much that you recognize, recall its quieter pace of life, and marvel again at the great diversity of landscape, seasons, and weather.<br />Kathleen Norris has written an appreciative introduction to the book, and Brown has an essay at the end, describing a lifetime of fascination with this part of the world. The book includes a listing of all its photographs, noting the location of each and the year in which it was taken.

Fascinating and compelling, yes; heartbreaking, often; hair-raising sometimes; exasperating, occasionally. Mostly, it is a vivid reminder of what it is to be still very young, naive, and adventuresome. It's also a book that's very hard to put down.<br />The reader, of course, knows from the start that Everett Ruess disappears at the age of 21 while on a walkabout somewhere near the Colorado River, in the remote 1930s wilderness of southern Utah. Gifted, bright, and almost painfully sensitive, he writes letters home that are sweetly poignant, thoughtful, opinionated, and rapturously descriptive of the natural environment he loves. Starting at the age of 16, while still a high school student in Hollywood, California, he journeys to Carmel, Arizona, and the Sierras. Leaving UCLA after one unhappy semester, he returns to the Four Corners region of Arizona and drifts northward into Utah where he follows the Escalante down to the Colorado and then vanishes.<br />A lover of classical music, a reader of books, poet, writer, water colorist, and block print maker, he considers himself very much a misfit in a world of conformity, where people live lives of quiet desperation, pursuing material goals that make them unhappy and unfulfilled. Torn between his desire for companionship and his love of wilderness solitude, he appreciates warm and welcoming company wherever he happens upon it, and seeks it out when he can, sometimes introducing himself to established artists, such as photographers Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. During visits to the home of painter Maynard Dixon, in San Francisco, he is befriended and photographed by Dixon's wife, Dorothea Lange. One of these photographs eventually appears in a missing persons report in a publication of the Los Angeles Police Department.<br />It's easy to go on and on about this book. The letters provide such a rich psychological portrait of this young man, full of interesting contradictions and curious prophecies of his eventual fate. Meanwhile, there is the mystery of his disappearance and the various theories and speculation about what may have happened to him, which are also included by the book's author.<br />I am happy to recommend this book to anyone interested in the West, stories about coming of age and self-reliance, rhapsodic descriptions of nature, personal adventures, the desert, Native Americans, and unsolved mysteries. As companion volumes, I'd also suggest Edward Abbey's &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; and Eliot Porter's excellent collection of photographs, &quot;The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado.&quot;and curious prophecies of his eventual fate.

There are 170 quotes on over a dozen different subjects by cowboys and ranchers interviewed by Arnold during 1975-1996, and the book includes more than 120 black-and-white photographs of these men, their families, their horses and gear, and the landscapes that they work in. Topics range across a variety of aspects of cowboy lifestyle as it's lived on ranches throughout the western states from New Mexico to Montana. Among the many working cowboys Arnold interviews are even a few celebrities: Ben Johnson, Wiford Brimley, Rex Allen, Charlie Daniels, and Baxter Black. A short introduction was written by cowboy stuntman and Academy Award winning actor Richard Farnsworth.<br />Most informative for me were the sections on the differing traditions of Texas-style cowboys, who range across the Southwest and eastern slopes of the Rockies, and California-style buckaroos, who work the Great Basin of Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada. The details of cowboy gear are also presented well, with accompanying photographs and interviews with saddlemakers. A glossary at the back of the book defines a lot of these terms: hackamore, jinglebobs, mecate, snaffle bits. It also includes cowboy terminology, which often shows up in the interviews: roping cattle, drag the calves, pull a wagon.<br />A great pleasure is reading the words of cowboys themselves, as they express their various opinions, relate their memories of adventures, and talk about horses. What comes across over and again is a love of this way of life, despite the fact that looking after cattle on horseback is hard physical labor and pays little. You understand their pride, their sense of self-reliance and the importance of being recognized by others as &quot;the man for the job.&quot; I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the West, cowboys, and ranching.

This is arid country where spring runoff from the mountains gathers in lakes and swamps used for millennia as a stopover by migrating waterbirds. Enter the enterprising Kittredge family, and during the 20th century thousands of acres here were transformed into a vast irrigated ranch, its chief output evolving from cattle to grain to hay to feed milling and feedlots. More to the point, they built an agricultural empire and became wealthy.<br />The author, born into this world in the 1930s, looks back from the vantage point of 1992, long after leaving the ranch behind and settling in Montana. What he sees is the wreckage of three generations blighted by ambition, greed, arrogance, and no small amount of alcohol. Kittredge talks often about how personal stories illuminate and ground people's lives, yet he and so many of the people around him are directionless and unmoored. His book is a story in which words like \\"reckless,\\" \\"hapless,\\" and \\"heedless\\" are often used to describe actions.<br />It is a painful book because there is so much heartache in it, so much confusion, shame, isolation, and fear. There are betrayals, infidelities, friendships and marriages ended, deaths from accidents and mishaps. In all of it, from earliest memories to those of a man on the verge of middle-age, the author describes a deep uncertainty about his own worth and his purpose in life. For many years, it seems to be only the grueling hard work of the ranch, which he only half understands, that keeps him distracted from a sense that nothing is real. (Steady consumption of alcohol and extramarital sex also figure into the mix.)<br />The book is something of a coming-of-age story about a young man whose manhood continually seems to elude him, well into his thirties. He can go through the motions in the hardworking environment of seasoned cowboys and field hands (an episode in which he takes the place of an injured hay stacker is an example), but he remains unsure of himself, wanting the security of the family ranch, while hating himself for not pursuing the writing career he believes is his real vocation. It's a wonderfully (and frustratingly) complex picture of a young man self-destructing. And in his seeming indifference to his own children, you sense a repetition of the same indifferent parenting that has led him into this emotional cul-de-sac. Significantly, he remarks often about the lack of a guiding hand to show him the way to be a man.<br />As a kind of confessional, it is a compelling book, and the impact of the story is underscored by the vast Western landscape against which it plays out. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the West and ranch life, cowboys, family sagas, and coming-of-age memoirs. As a companion volume, I'd also suggest Judy Blunt's ranch memoir \\"Breaking Clean\\" for its similar themes of emotional dislocation.ich he takes the place of an injured hay stacker is an example), but he remains unsure of himself, wanting the security of the family ranch, while hating himself for not pursuing the writing career he believes is his real vocation.

Its subject is ranchlife in Paradise Valley, Nevada, north of Winnemucca and near the Oregon border. First settled by California farmer/ranchers in the 1860s, the region's development was influenced by the Spanish colonial agricultural practices of California, and its \\"cowboys\\" have traditionally been known as \\"buckaroos,\\" an anglicized rendering of the Spanish \\"vaquero.\\"<br />Contents of the book are based on field research by the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress. It covers history of the region and then focuses on cowboy life and culture, including clothing, bunkhouses, and branding irons. The book contains many black and white photographs, both vintage and contemporary. Several are two-page spreads. There is also a list of 244 artifacts from the exhibition, with photos of many of them....<br />As of this writing...this wonderful book is out of print. If you can find a copy, it's well worth having.	2003-06-09

While Krutch harks back to Thoreau, his perspective, turns of thought, and style of expression are similar to the reflective essays of E. B. White. They begin with observations of plant and animal life and evolve into ruminations on the nature of human life.<br />Krutch writes of birds, the night sky, bats, saguaro cactus, ocotillo, and desert flowers. Considering them, he rediscovers the truth in ideas he has so long held as true that they've become near platitudes. Where there is plentitude in some things, for instance, there is no need for it in others. Nature cares for the species but not individuals, while human values tend toward the opposite. While every rose has its thorn, the blooming cactus shows us that the reverse is also true. A visit to the vastness and forbidding desert monuments of Cathedral Valley in south central Utah reminds him of the precariousness of human life.<br />The desert leads Krutch to contemplation of its paradoxes, as well. For instance, the struggle for life here where conditions for survival are more restrictive actually create an uncrowded and more serene ecosystem by comparison with the tropics. The varieties of bird life are vastly greater here than in more temperate climates. A species of toads can live unseen and unheard for 363 days of the year, emerging after a rain fall to sing and reproduce, then disappear and survive somehow in the waterless months between. Finally, there's one question he's never able to answer: why bats fly clockwise from Carlsbad cave.<br />You can't really know a place, he believes, until you have seen it both as novel and as familiar. A landscape is no more than a picture postcard until you have spent time there and discover yourself in the midst of it. &quot;The Desert Year&quot; is a wonderful account of that process and a celebration of the joy that can be found in settling down for a while in a place that gradually comes to feel like home.f that process and a celebration of the joy that can be found in settling down for a while in a place that gradually comes to feel like home.	2003-06-08

The author, an archaeologist by profession, has taken his camera to the states in the western Great Plains and the Great Basin of the Northwest and photographed the remains of homesteads that were once part of a thriving dry-land farming economy. There are photographs of abandoned farm houses, barns, schools, post offices, hotels, cemeteries, farm machinery and vehicles, and he has written a lengthy account of the period, based on research and personal interviews with descendants of homesteaders.<br />Today, where once stood prosperous farming communities joined by a network of roads and railways and served by a scattering of rural towns, fulfilling Thomas Jefferson's dream of a nation of small farmers, there is thinly populated ranchland, large hay fields, and expansive wheat growing operations. After decades of unusually high rainfall, these regions have returned to their normal arid conditions, which are unsuitable for dry-land farming. In some places, the prairie grass has reclaimed the land, obliterating evidence that the earth here was ever tilled. Only a few abandoned structures remain.<br />Campbell's photographs are fascinating and haunting. In many of them the vast sky looms overhead. Often in the distance there is a range of mountains, sometimes snow covered. The sunlight is bright and the shadows deep; the only signs of life are the grass and occasional trees. In all of them, the details are crisply focused, and where the landscape is flat and open, everything is sharply clear right to the horizon. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the West, images of the plains, and the history of homesteading.	2003-06-08

I was expecting a discourse on the healing power of the creative arts as an alternative therapy in medicine. Campo may write about that elsewhere, but not here. If anything, the book concerns the power of poetry for the physician in need of healing.<br />Campo's book is part memoir, part polemic. Chiefly, it recounts his struggles to forge a single identiy as doctor, poet, Latino, and gay man. He articulates with considerable and painful clarity the many ways in which these separate identities have been in conflict. They seem finally to come together in his role as a physician to AIDS patients. But even in that there is conflict, both with the devastating nature of the disease and the efforts of managed health care to diminish his best efforts to fulfill his calling as a doctor.<br />As memoir, his book retraces the steps of his life journey into his profession (at the time of the book's writing he is still a young doctor, in his early 30s). We meet his Cuban-American parents, learn of his middle class suburban background, and hear of his struggles of sexual identity, which produce in him intense shame, anger and fear. We follow him to Amherst, where he meets and falls in love with a fellow med student who becomes his life partner, and from there to residency in UCSF hospital in San Francisco. He describes his bout with suspected cancer, discovered after a skiing accident. And he tells of a patient, Gary, dying of AIDS, who teaches him much about being both a doctor and a poet.<br />As polemic, his book argues against homophobia (even as he overcomes it in himself) and its contribution to the continuing health crisis for gay men. He argues that the catch phrase \\"safe sex\\" diminishes the fragile self-esteem and challenges the identities of gay men. He argues that modern medicine, with its reliance on technology and pharmaceuticals and insistence on professional objectivity, robs young doctors of the compassion, empathy, and desire that drew them into the profession in the first place -- and thus makes them less effective in the delivery of health care. And he argues for the legitimacy of poetry as both a practice and a guiding metaphor for the role of physician. He notes that poetry and healing are both arts; one informs and supports the other.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the practice of modern medicine, the training and self-education of physicians, and journeys of self-discovery. It is especially affirming in its embrace of same-sex affection, love, and passion. As companion volumes, I recommend two other books: Richard Rodriguez' memoir \\"Hunger of Memory\\" and Abraham Verghese's account of his experience as an AIDS doctor, \\"My Own Country.\\"t drew them into the profession in the first place -- and thus makes them less effective in the delivery of health care.

While Abbey's descriptions are vivid, I wanted to see with my own eyes what he was describing. And Porter's camera is the closest you can get to doing that today.<br />His pictures are, of course, not the real thing, but they are about as breathtaking as photography can be. The colors, textures, reflections, and the play of light and shadow are wonderful, and each photograph is distinctly different. His own description of the canyon's display of color and light in the introductory essay &quot;The Living Canyon&quot; give an instructive insight into the eye of the photographer. His awareness of what he is looking at and his ways of choosing to look help the reader to see even more in the 80 photographs that follow.<br />While some of the photographs capture the monumental scale of the canyon walls and formations, many focus on the myriad surfaces that are revealed to the eye: erosion patterns, lichen, rippling water flow, the dark streaking mineral stains extending from seeps, the rough texture of weathered sandstone in glancing sunlight, smooth river stones, the layered stripes of exposed sediment, the trickling spread of water falling from overhead springs, the hanging tapestry coloration of the walls, whorled and striated rock, dry sand. There are also photographs of plants: moonflower, maidenhair fern, willow, tamarisk, redbud, columbine, cane. Above all, there is the rich array of colors, capturing a great variety of moods and attitudes.<br />Porter was recognized for his photography of birds, and while there are no birds visible in these photographs, his introductory essay makes mention of them, and when looked at with that awareness, many of the pictures also seem to capture a sense of &quot;air space&quot; for flight. Before turning to photography, Porter was a Harvard professor of biochemistry and bacteriology, and it's interesting to see the somewhat dispassionate eye of the scientist in the way he uses the camera. While the story of Glen Canyon may induce sorrow or anger, the photographs are strong for their lack of sentimentality.<br />The pictures also excite a curiosity about the geology of the river, and the book concludes with a short essay describing how the canyon walls reveal the geological ages that have gone into forming this part of the earth, going back millions of years. The book also includes a catalog of all the plants and animals that inhabited Glen Canyon before its inundation. Altogether, with its quotes from other writers, including Loren Eiseley, Joseph Wood Krutch, Wallace Stegner, and members of John Wesley Powell's expedition in the 19th century, this book is a fitting record of a great lost national treasure.turning to photography, Porter was a Harvard professor of biochemistry and bacteriology, and it's interesting to see the somewhat dispassionate eye of the scientist in the way he uses the camera.

For anyone whose knowledge of this period is as limited as mine, it's also full of surprises -- lots of them. Historian Everett Dick dips into a substantial collection of documents, listed in his 10-page bibliography, and organizes what he's found into 35 chapters, each on a different subject, including the sod house of the title, homesteading, prairie towns, vigilante justice, farmers vs. cattlemen, extremes of weather, Indians, hunting and trapping, the railroad, sports, education, the church, journalism, doctors, lawyers, and entertainment. And that covers only about half of them.<br />Settlement moved quickly and furiously across the Missouri River, while the federal government was still negotiating the relocation of the current residents, i.e. Native Americans, then spread across the territories in a surge of speculation and rapid development in a series of booms and busts. Cliches and stereotypes from movies and television quickly fall left, right, and center, as the author revels in the rich tapestry of human endeavors portrayed against a raw, still alien landscape. Law and order were virtually nonexistent, and a recurring theme in the book is the frequency of scams, fraud, graft, and chicanery of all kinds that were the order of the day. In such an environment, the carrying of weapons was universal, and differences of opinion were normally settled with bloodshed and no questions asked afterwards.<br />There is the land rush, featuring claim jumpers and speculators with no interest in tilling the soil or putting down roots but turning a quick buck, usually in total violation of whatever law existed at the time. There are the wild cat banks, printing their own money, all of it eventually worthless to those left holding it. There are the crooked investment schemes that raised capital for towns that were never built. Prairie communities lure railroad companies to build lines in their direction with outlays of cash. Elections are rigged, bribes paid, and blood spilled over the location of county seats. Phony local governments elect themselves into office and after borrowing money for public projects abscond with the funds and leave the area's legitimate settlers under a crushing load of debt. And on and on. It's a fascinating account of the frontier as a kind of bonfire of vanities.<br />But this is only one theme in the book. There are many others, and much to relish in descriptions of the daily life of more ordinary folks who are typically jacks of all trades, short of cash, either hard-working or hard-drinking, often overwhelmed by the isolation of their circumstances. It's a delight, for instance, to read of country and small town pastimes and pleasures from baseball to dances that go until sunup.<br />Given the book's origins in the 1930s, it tends to neglect the lives of women (an oversight that has been corrected in many more recent books), and while it seems to want to give a balanced view of Indians, it tends to focus its interests elsewhere. Unfortunately, the treatment of African Americans is somewhat condescending. Those faults aside, the book is a page-turner, especially for anyone who, as I did, grew up in this part of the world with only a glimmer of an idea of its actual history.capital for towns that were never built.

Here's another one. Aadland is the son of a Lutheran minister, growing up in south central Montana between the Beartooth Mountains and the Crow Reservation. His \\"memoir\\" is mostly about the present, with flashbacks to the past, which include stories of his wife's forebears, who emigrated from Norway in the late 19th century to set themselves up as ranchers. And there are memories of his boyhood, working as a hired hand, a tour of duty in Vietnam as a marine, and raising a family.<br />The particular achievement of the book is its description of daily life on a modern-day ranch. Of the many books on ranching, this one conveys better than most the seasonal routines of labor from spring calving and breeding to fall roundup, sale barns, and feeding during the months of snow. There are descriptions of haying, fieldwork, irrigation, keeping machinery running, and visits from the vet. The book also describes well the evolution of ranchwork from when ranchers used horses and hired men to get the work done, and neighbors pitched in to help each other with harvesting. Today, much of the work is mechanized, ranchers work alone, and the undependable seasons, slow markets, and razor-thin profit margins require second incomes for both rancher and spouse. Besides raising cattle, Aadland and his wife are school teachers. He travels 60 miles each way to the high school in Bridger (pop. 724), and in winter months sees the ranch in sunlight only on weekends.<br />He's also a horseman, raising and training walking horses, and much of the book is devoted to this subject. There are descriptions of patiently working his horses, including a team he uses to harrow a field for no other reason than to experience the pleasure of this old-fashioned method of farming -- no deafening engine to block out the sounds of the natural environment, or to damage hearing. He's a literate rancher, quoting Robert Frost and Thoreau, and both thoughtful and articulate. He's also informative. You learn about practices of breeding horses and cows and how a vet tests for pregnancy. You learn the tentative relationship between weather forecasts and the timing of cutting and baling hay. He has a steady eye and a sense of pacing that makes his book a graceful and unhurried cycle through the seasons. You become so intimately involved in Aadland's life that the sudden tragedy that occurs in the final chapters is both a jolting surprise and thoroughly heart-breaking<br />It should also be mentioned that this is a handsomely designed book, illustrated with many fine drawings of ranch life by artist Nik Carpenter. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in working ranches, the Big Sky country, horses, and the making of not just a living but a life. As a companion volume, I suggest \\"Some Horses\\" by Thomas McGuane, another Montana writer, as well as Linda Hasselstrom's \\"Windbreak,\\" which recounts a year on a cattle ranch in South Dakota.e.

Here he was a park ranger, when the park was still mostly undeveloped. Living in a small trailer, keeping an eye on the campers and tourists, he mostly relishes the quiet, beauty, and indifference of the desert under its hot sun.<br />The book begins with his arrival in April and concludes with his departure at season's end in September. In between are chapters devoted to descriptions of his rambles across the terrain, helping a local cattleman round up cows in the side canyons, trying to capture a one-eyed feral horse, camping on a 13,000-foot local mountain, hiking with a friend into an uncharted wilderness call the Maze, and retrieving the body of a dead tourist. There's also a dark story concerning the unfortunate fate of some uranium prospectors. The longest chapter is a rapturous account of a week spent rafting down the Colorado River, he and a friend among the last to see the canyons about to be inundated by the Glen Canyon Dam and the creation of Lake Powell.<br />Along the way, there are ruminations on the meaning of it all and diatribes against urbanization, intrusive government, the tourist industry, and the destruction of wilderness. The word &quot;solitaire&quot; in the title is an apt choice, as much of the time Abbey is alone, thinking his thoughts and observing this desert world, its plants and wild life, geological formations, and the big sky with its turns of weather. Even when paired up with a companion, he is often off alone, on a walkabout of his own, like as not shedding his clothes.<br />His thoughts, meanwhile, are informed by wide reading in philosophy, history, natural sciences, and literature. As a writer, he's frequently quotable: &quot;Where there is no joy there can be no courage; and without courage all other virtues are useless.&quot; &quot;It's a great country: you can say whatever you like so long as it is strictly true -- nobody will ever take you seriously.&quot;<br />The vistas he describes so eloquently are not hard to picture in the imagination, but I recommend an accompanying volume of photography, such as Eliot Porter's &quot;The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado.&quot; Unless you're familiar with borage, paintbrush, globemallow, and dozens of other desert species, a picture guidebook to the flora of the region would also be helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed Abbey's book, shared the excitement of his adventures, found his cranky, ornery, sometimes self-indulgent perspective refreshing, and felt saddened by the end-of-season farewell with which it closes. In any list of nonfiction books about the West, it should be near the top.As a writer, he's frequently quotable: &quot;Where there is no joy there can be no courage; and without courage all other virtues are useless.&quot; &quot;It's a great country: you can say whatever you like so long as it is strictly true -- nobody will ever take you seriously.&quot;<br />The vistas he describes so eloquently are not hard to picture in the imagination, but I recommend an accompanying volume of photography, such as Eliot Porter's &quot;The Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado.&quot; Unless you're familiar with borage, paintbrush, globemallow, and dozens of other desert species, a picture guidebook to the flora of the region would also be helpful.

His memoir is a rhapsody of affection for the land where he grew up -- the small towns, homesteads and ranches in the Smith River Valley, along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, extending north to the Blackfeet Reservation on the Canadian border. It's also a wonderful and often touching story of a father and son. Born in 1939, Doig begins his tale with the emigration of his forebears from Scotland to Montana. At the end, in the 1970s, he has emerged as a writer with a graduate degree, living in Seattle, with rich and deeply felt memories of the people and the land he has known -- the house of sky.<br />An only child, his mother dying when he is six years old, Doig is raised by his father, Charlie, who works various jobs, sheepherding, haying, moving from place to place, and for a while leasing a small ranch of his own, his son in tow. Charlie is a hard-working man, with a big heart and tender love for his son. Concerned by a turn of bad health, he is reconciled to his mother-in-law, who did not approve of her daughter's marriage to him, and the three of them become a family that remains together until Charlie's death at age 70.<br />The book captures and preserves in detail a way of life that has almost vanished from America. Doig tells of growing up in wide open spaces among livestock and wildlife, learning from his father the skills of making a living off the land and surviving against the odds. He attends small town schools, spending the winters in rented rooms, seeing his father and grandmother only on weekends. Much of his time spent with adults or alone, he grows up more quickly than his peers and learns to love solitude.<br />At 300+ pages, this is not a long book, but it's no page-turner. You find yourself reading it slowly, relishing the rich prose style that captures the poetry in this landscape of mountains, valleys, and plains, as well as the people, with their personal quirks, habits, ways of talking, and often eccentric behavior. In fact, the book reads much like a novel, full of stories, colorful characters, humor, pathos, suspense, and adventures. The vividness of Doig's writing reflects his training as a journalist, and I suspect that he may have been influenced more than a little by the novels of Thomas Wolfe. I recommend \\"This House of Sky\\" to anyone with an interest in the West, nature writing, books about growing up, family sagas, ranching and rural life.

Each maintains a love of the open prairie, but while Alexandra Bergson in \\"O Pioneers!\\" is able to hold her own and thrive on the land, Blunt is hemmed in and frustrated at each turn, a ranchwife-in-training through girlhood and finally a ranchwife with children of her own. Physically strong and fearless as any man, she uses hard labor as a way to cope with a life-long belief in the fundamental unfairness of being denied opportunities simply because of her gender. In her thirties, she finally leaves the ranch and starts a new life in Missoula as a divorced mother, university student, and writer.<br />However, her book is not about the break-up of her marriage or her final decision to leave behind the life she'd been living. It is a carefully remembered recounting of her childhood, youth, and early years as a rancher's wife. It's an often turbulent story, where every passage from one stage of life to the next is marked by resistance, dismay, and a sense of deep loss. The people in the circle of her family are captured in fiercely observed detail -- especially her mother and father, her sister Gail, her husband John, and John's parents. The physical world they inhabit is vividly rendered -- the character of the arid, prairie land, the seasonal changes, the extremes of weather, the isolation, and the difficulty of making a living out here against the odds. She also captures the constraints of the social world they inhabit, and she articulates clearly the limited possibilities for personal growth and independence where gender roles and social norms are rigidly observed.<br />She provides a realistic portrayal of ranch work for men, women, and their children as long days (and nights during calving season) of routine physical labor, and she describes the neverending work of cooking, gardening, child-rearing, putting up food for the winter, trips to town for supplies, doing ranch chores, and pitching in when the men need an extra hand. Meanwhile, the chapters in her book center around the breaks in the routine -- the unexpected events that become the material for \\"stories,\\" the makings of family lore, local legend, or gossip (as when her newly-wed husband John is observed welding together the broken frame of their old bed).<br />Among the breaks in the routine, there is an Indian boy who is a student for a short while in her all-white one-room school, the winter of 1964 which maroons her family during a severe blizzard that wipes out much of their cattle herd, a prairie fire fought by the whole community, an older boy in high school who attempts unsuccessfully to have sex with her, a harrowing 50-mile trip to the nearest hospital as her daughter is burning up with a high fever. Blunt also describes well the cultural clash that occurs when kids born and raised in the country find themselves navigating the town-oriented world of high school, with its very different adolescent mores and values.<br />Blunt is a fine writer and is able to wring suspense and pathos from her material. Starting as she does with the break-up of her marriage and then backtracking to tell her story from the beginning, she makes of the book a real page-turner. While the book might well appear on a list of feminist literature, such a label is too limiting. The story she has too tell is much broader; it is at home with books about rites of passage and coming of age, the West, rural living, ranching, and nature writing. As a companion to this book, I'd also recommend Linda Hasselstrom's \\"Windbreak: A Woman Rancher on the Northern Plains\\" and Wallace Stegner's \\"Wolf Willow,\\" which describes his boyhood on a homestead along the Montana-Saskatchewan border, 50 years earlier and about 100 miles northwest of Blunt's country.try.	2003-05-10

Writing in the 1950s, Stegner captures the breath-taking beauty of the unbroken plains of southwest Saskatchewan and the excitement of its settlment at the turn of the century. Part memoir, the book recounts the years of his boyhood in a small town along the Whitemud River in 1914-1919, the summers spent on the family's homestead 50 miles away along the Canadian-U.S border. His book is also an account of the loss of that Eden and the failed promise of agricultural development in this semi-arid region with thin top soil.<br />Stegner is a gifted, intelligent writer, able to turn the people and events of history into compelling reading. The opening section of the book describes the experience of being on the plains and specifically in the area where Stegner was a boy. And it lays out the geography of that land -- a distant range of hills, the river, the coulees, the town -- which the book will return to again and again.<br />The following section evokes the period of frontier Canada's early exploration, the emergence of the metis culture, the destruction of the buffalo herds, the introduction of rangeland cattle, and then wave upon wave of settlement pushing the last of the plains Indians westward and northward. A chapter is devoted to the surveying of the boundary along the Canada-U.S. border; another chapter describes the founding of the Mounted Police and its purely Canadian style of bringing law and order to the wild west.<br />The middle section of the book is a novella and a short story about the winter of 1906-1907. In the longer piece, eight men rounding up cattle are caught on the open plains in an early blizzard. Stegner builds the drama and the peril of their situation artfully and convincingly. The final section of the book returns to Stegner's memories of the town and the homestead, ending with his family's departure for Montana.<br />Stegner lived at a time and in a place where a person born in the 20th century could still experience something of the sweep of history that transformed the American plains. I've read many books about the West, and because of  his depth of thought, his gifts as a writer, and his unflinching eye, Stegner's work ranks for me among the best.

It's located not far north of the Platte River and its farmlands, and not far south of the Sandhills, with its population of cattle and cowboys. Life in Centralia gravitates toward the Town Tavern, where many of these story-essays take place, and we meet Welsch's fictionalized friends and neighbors: Lunchbox, Goose, Slick, Woodrow, and Cece -- the regulars. There are also his wife Lily, daughter Jenny, an Indian friend Cal, a kind-hearted bachelor uncle named Grover Bass, a film crew from public television in Lincoln, a mean cuss named Royal Cupp, a rip-tearing adventurer, Luke Bigelow, and many others.<br />Welsch has an appreciation for the quirky, cock-eyed, and audacious. Like an endlessly curious anthropologist, he's equally fascinated by the everyday and the out-of-the-ordinary. He's a humanist, romanticizing his characters even while he's treating them with tongue-in-cheek irony. He's also willing to show that they can stoop to the unforgivable, or that they do not share his appreciation for people from other ethnic backgrounds. There is a range of tones and sentiments in the book, from comic farce to tenderness and awe. My favorite essay, &quot;Racing Horses at the Centralia Fourth of July,&quot; ranges across all three, as his young teenage daughter teams up with a burly cowboy to take second place in a relay race. I laughed and had tears in my eyes by the end.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and happily recommend it to anyone with an interest in small town life on the Plains. As a companion volume, I'd suggest the short stories of life in a rural Minnesota community in Kent Meyers' &quot;Light in the Crossing.&quot;ers' &quot;Light in the Crossing.&quot;	2003-04-30

This is one of those ground-breaking books that are also exasperating, because you know the author is right at least half of the time, but you don't know which half is right. Grimm's overall objective is to find a way to make higher education \\"fairer\\" for students who lack the advantages of most mainstream students who grow up in white, middle-class households, and she has written a thoughtful analysis based on wide reading across several disciplines (there are well over 100 items in the Works Cited). From the perspective of the Writing Center, which originated at the same time that growing numbers of nontraditional students began flooding American colleges and universities, she has a first-hand perspective of the mismatch between these students and the expectations of their professors.<br />Although political, the book is not a polemic so much as an academic inquiry into time-honored values of liberal education. And she uses postmodern thought as a basis for asking questions that get at long-held assumptions about what students should learn and how they should learn it. She articulates well how discourse (the conversation that takes place among people creating knowledge) locks its participants into certain viewpoints that make it hard for them to see the perspectives ot those outside the discourse itself. But the drawback of postmodernism is that it is yet another form of discourse, with its own assumptions, and that's where a reader of the book can begin to experience it as a kind of hall of mirrors, where everything is called into question, including the author's own argument. The subject of literacy, which may seem to be a simple concept, becomes far more complex than you may have ever imagined.<br />Fewer than 150 pages in length, the book has more packed into it than many others on similar subjects. It handles complex ideas clearly and is quite readable, with a minimum of postmodern jargon. It comes to life especially when Grimm uses the examples of actual students and tutors in her Writing Lab at Michigan Technical University in the Upper Pennisula. I strongly recommend her book to anyone looking for fresh perspectives on education and new ways of understanding literacy.dents and tutors in her Writing Lab at Michigan Technical University in the Upper Pennisula.

C. L. Rawlins' day-by-day reminiscences based on a journal he kept in 1973 as cook and horse wrangler for a sheepherder makes no bones about it -- the scenery may be breathtaking, but the work is mostly back breaking and sometimes dangerous. Rawlins, in his early 20s, takes the job as a kind of escape from several personal struggles, including an ambivalence about the war in Vietnam, which has caused a rift with his family. There's also a romance that's gone somewhat haywire.<br />But almost immediately, the mountains, still under snow in mid-July at the high passes, and the demanding work envelope him in a physical world where his only human companion is a pony-tailed sheepherder, Mitch, not much older than himself. There is wind, rain, sun, hail, more rain, heat, frost, and then snow again before the short summer is over. There are bear, coyotes, hawks and other wildlife. There are walks by moonlight, and reading Homer by candlelight. There's the round of meals to be prepared: bacon, beans, chili, tortillas, currant muffins, rhubarb pie.<br />They meet a team of Basque herders. Driving in on old logging roads, Rawlins' brother visits until they get on each other nerves. Then his girlfriend visits, and after their heated lovemaking tells him she's seeing someone else. Through it all, the author recounts the emotional ups and downs of a young man unsure of his place in the world, but sure of one thing -- that he has a deep fascination for this \\"broken country\\" of mountain ranges, rocky ridges, wildflowers, streams, and meadows. Much of his book is rich with detailed descriptions of carefully observed landscapes. I felt when I finished the book that I had been on a long journey away from civilization.<br />Writing 20 years later, Rawlins preserves the point of view of his younger self, complete with the youthful excesses that express his angst and exuberance, often told in short personal poems. I recommend this book to anyone interested in nature writing, the mountain West, ranching, and roughing it in the outdoors.

He accomplishes this feat in 300 pages by presenting the story as a human drama, focusing on the lives of individuals, living and dead, each with their own aspirations, history, and personality.<br />On the one hand are the white farmers who have settled legally within the boundaries of the reservation, \\"reclaiming\\" arid land with water provided by federally funded irrigation systems. On the other are the Indians of two tribes, Shoshone and Arapaho, historically antagonistic, reduced by over a century of conquest and together discovering a new-found strength to resist the will of state and federal governments. Among them are the college-educated, the young drop-outs, the old who still remember some of the lost Indian culture -- a wide range of people challenging easy ethnic stereotypes while at the same time representing the social ills that plague the reservations: poverty, unemployment, alcoholism. It is a Dickensian cast of characters.<br />A third group of key figures in O'Gara's story are the non-Indian professionals whose lives become entwined with reservation residents as the struggle over water rights heats up: engineers, hydrologists, conservationists, bureaucrats, lawyers and judges. The endless legal battles bring to mind Dickens' \\"Bleak House.\\" Court decisions progressively yield more ground to the Indians, and appeals take the case against them all the way to the Supreme Court, yet after $50 million in legal fees, the issues remain unresolved.<br />While O'Gara makes an effort to maintain a journalist's objectivity throughout the book, his underlying sympathy is pretty clearly with the Indians, whom he gives the lion's share of the book to. Seeming to acquire privileged information in his interviews, he also points out that as a journalist he is often permitted to know what will best serve the Indians' purposes. He must still question its veracity and speculate about the rest, based on what seems to be extensive research in public records and historical accounts.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the American West, its history, cultures, geology, topography. The book is organized as a journey upstream, along the river's two main branches, into its headwaters in mountain glaciers. In fact, it's a good idea to have a map of Wyoming at hand for reference. As a companion to this book, I'd recommend Frank Clifford's \\"Backbone of the World,\\" which explores some of this same subject matter and introduces readers to many other inhabitants up and down the Continental Divide.e is often permitted to know what will best serve the Indians' purposes.

At first glance you expect it to be a book of nature writing about the Southwest deserts. However, the quirky title should be a give away. Meloy's subject is the relationship between the arid regions of the American Southwest and the birth of the nuclear age. Not a duck-and-cover memoir of someone growing up in the 1950s, this book is a thoughtful inquiry into what is for the author a great irony: that nuclear weaponry emerged from uranium deposits mined from near where she lives in southern Utah and then processed and assembled into the first atomic bombs in the deserts of New Mexico.<br />The contrast between the awesome, quiet beauty of the desert and its use to develop weapons of mass destruction is a supreme contradiction that drives Meloy on a journey that takes her to ground zero at White Sands Missile Range, Los Alamos, and a natural gas field bounded by Navajo, Ute, and Apache reservations. The book closes on a walkabout across the mesas and through canyons near her home in the San Juan River valley, which cuts across the Southwest's Four Corners.<br />Also a surprise is the ironic humor she brings to the subject. While never forgetting the threat to survival of humanity that nuclear weapons represent, Meloy also marvels at the incongruities in the details of a story that encompasses the worlds of physicists, environmentalists, biologists, geologists, naturalists, anthropologists, Native Americans, tourists, and the ordinary working people and residents of present-day small towns and rural areas. On a parallel course with the story she tells are the incongruities of her own story, which starts with the accidental scalding death of a lizard in a coffee cup and ends on a high bluff in a tumultuous electrical storm.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the American Southwest, its history and geology, and a kind of nature writing that engages subjects beyond itself and attempts to reconcile them. Instead of using wilderness to escape from the realities of the modern world, Meloy attempts to embrace the two, with a wry smile, even while experiencing a shudder that sometimes shakes her to the core.concile them.

Turner has a sharp eye for detail and an ability to craft personal experience and an encyclopedic scale of information into engaging reading on subjects as varied as saguaro cactuses, chili con carne (with a recipe for Basic Texas Red), management of wild horse herds, Billy the Kid, Basque sheepherders in the Great Basin, and a Czech festival each autum in Deming, New Mexico.<br />Especially interesting for this reader is his essay on the lives of two early 20th-century writers who turned their own frontier experiences into best-sellers that shaped American awareness of the West: James Willard Schultz (&quot;My Life as an Indian,&quot; 1907) and Will James (&quot;Lone Cowboy,&quot; 1930). Based in Santa Fe, Turner roams over the southern arid states where inhabitants set their clocks to Mountain Time. And his essays are fine examples of travel writing that appreciates both landscape and centuries of human history. This is an excellent addition to any bookshelf of nonfiction Western literature.	2003-04-05

This collection of personal essays, part memoir, argues that history lives, often unacknowledged, in our bodies. The catastrophe of shattered Indian cultures lives on, generations later, in the shattered lives of so many descendants of those tribes.<br />Hogan is of Chickasaw descent, her ancestors inhabitants of what is now Tennessee and Mississippi, forcibly relocated over 100 years ago to the \\"Indian Territory\\" of Oklahoma, a journey remembered as the Trail of Tears. Her father an Army sergeant, she spent her first years in Germany, and in later years lived in Colorado. It was a difficult childhood, including a teenage \\"marriage\\" to an older man, a silent mother terrified of other people, her father often absent. She writes of her own alcoholism and adoption of two Lakota sisters, both deeply scarred emotionally by a history of severe child abuse.<br />Hogan's book is an account of her emergence from the \\"dark underworld\\" of her early life and the discovery of her own humanity and capacity for love. There is the love for her troubled daughters and the love she learns to feel for her parents, in particular her father, who grew up as a cowboy and whose world forever made cowboys and horses appealing to her.<br />There is much about pain in Hogan's story -- physical, emotional, spiritual. There is the pain of cultural genocide, and its aftermath in the scourge of alcoholism, poverty, domestic violence, and child abuse. There is the pain of her own troubled life and that of her daughters. There is also the pain of a debilitating physical condition, fibromyalgia. Finally, there is a near fatal accident when she falls from a runaway horse, causing a head injury and fractured pelvis and requiring many months of recovery.<br />Besides her own story, there are illuminating ruminations in this book on memory, dreams, lost souls, horses, the body, landscapes, identity, and myth. You put the book down after the last page with a sense that you have been on a long, deeply experienced personal journey. Hogan makes reference to Andre Dubus, another writer whose life was abruptly changed by an accident.

Also instructive is a brief literature review that summarizes a range of perspectives on writing centers that have been articulated by practitioners over the past couple of decades.<br />The book's central idea is that the writing center should be &quot;noisy&quot; (open to the unplanned and unexpected, as an appropriate environment for learning), rather than methodical and harmonious, or quiet. It even discusses at length the physics of feedback, using Jimi Hendrix' trademark style as an example of how noise can open up a kind of internal creative space.<br />There are also long sections of the book describing the personalities of various tutors who have worked in the author's own writing center at Fairfield University in Connecticut, as well as the writing center of a colleague at Rhode Island College. We get transcriptions of exchanges between them at meetings and long excerpts from log entries and papers written by them. As well as this can be done in print, there is a sense conveyed of earnest young minds trying to make a difference in the educational lives of other students.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who is as much a romantic about education as Boquet seems to be. If you believe that the institution of higher education needs a revolution; that learning should bring liberation and empowerment to the marginalized and disenfranchised; that too many faculty members do not &quot;get it&quot;; that education should redress social injustices and bring healing, then you'll find this book about university writing tutors of interest and even entertaining.	2003-03-27

For all that has been lost, there is an insistence among these writers on a kind of redeeming integrity that can be found in treasuring what is left. And there's also a good deal of humor. Edward Abbey's diatribe against cowboys and ranchers' access to public lands is uproarious. So is Bill Vaughan's \\"Notes from the Squalor Zone,\\" about a kind of Western-style hillbilly existence on the fringes of some unnamed city, referred to only as the Valley of the Liberals. There are essays on playing poker, drive-in theaters, western cooking (SOB stew and \\"prairie oysters\\"), an old-time hardware store, and the Russian origin of tumbleweeds. More sobering subjects include editor Donald Snow's \\"Ecocide\\" and Frederick Turner's \\"Wounded Knee III.\\"<br />Lest anyone assume that western writers are typically male, roughly one-third of the forty contributors are women, including Gretel Ehrlich and Judy Blunt, writing on subjects ranging from girls riding horseback to breast cancer, coyotes, Native Americans, winter camping with at-risk youth, ranchers' wives, and why working men don't wear wedding rings.  And Louise Erdrich provides an introduction.<br />A brief summary like this can only brush over the surface of this wonderfully rich book. You come away with a sense that the subject is much too vast to encompass in a single volume, and in the face of all this diversity, stereotypes and cliches about the West soon evaporate. I happily recommend this book to anyone interested in the high plains and mountain states, and in hearing the voices of men and women from a wide range of backgrounds, whose life journeys find them somewhere in that landscape.

It's a good read, a page-turner; shocking at points, funny at others. As a story set in small town Mississippi during the 1960s, it invites comparison with Faulkner, and has plenty of Faulkner's melodrama, but without the convoluted prose style and endless sentences. In the opening pages there are two murders and the killing and mutilation of a monkey. This is followed by scenes of heavy drinking, desultory sex, rape, street fighting, shootings, more drinking, breaking and entering, theft, more sex, assault, all set against a history of more of the same. That's the steamy Faulknerian pot-boiler part that keeps you turning pages.<br />What Brown brings to the mix is a fascination with the absolutely ordinary routine of daily life that his characters live in the midst of all the melodrama. During the handful of days during which the action of the story takes place, we get to spend a lot of time with several of his characters: an old widower living alone with his dog, an unmarried mother who works as a fry-cook in a diner, the sheriff who still lives with his mother, an ex-con just out of prison, his hapless brother with a trailer house full of kids, who loses his job, and a retired school teacher who's grown son was fathered by a local married man.<br />As the long, hot summer days and nights pass, one after the other, Brown follows his characters, each often alone with their thoughts, at home, at work, or just driving their cars. The pace between sudden bursts of plot is slow, unhurried. Brown notes the passage of the sweltering sun across the sky and the eventual storms that bring rain. And you become absorbed not only in the gradual flow of daily activity and the small talk that disguises deeper yearnings and sorrows, but in the Faulkner-like ghosts of a violent and passionate past that continue to haunt the present.<br />The book is true to its title, being full of layer upon layer of references to fathers and sons, and in particular the emotional damage done when sons die young and suddenly. A quick count in the novel yields five dead sons, whose fathers live on after them in various states of grief. In some ways, the narrative flow is almost biblical. The old man with his good-son, bad-son offspring bring to mind Adam, Cain, and Abel. Or David and Absalom.<br />I recommend this novel to anyone interested in the writers of the Deep South. Brown has certainly earned his place in that tradition.sons, and in particular the emotional damage done when sons die young and suddenly.

I wasn't crazy about the film but was fascinated by the imagination it emerged from, and gave one of his books a try. For starters, I read his memoir \\"On Fire,\\" about his years as an Oxford, Mississippi, fireman. I thought it would be about fighting fires, responding to emergencies, and what goes on in the firehouse in between. I expected some reflection on the world of firemen, which I understand to be a social order of its own, like policemen.<br />There is all of that and considerably more in this wonderful collection of short essays, many of them dashed off during those off hours in the firehouse, often recounting an experience Brown and his compatriots just had, rescuing someone trapped in a smashed car, putting out a fire, or just screwing around. You learn something of the process of firefighting as Brown reconstructs the events of several fires, including one in the top floor of a building at Ole Miss. He explains how they use the Jaws of Life. You learn about the daily routines of checking equipment for readiness, as well as continual training in CPR and different kinds of fires.<br />But much in the book is unexpected. There are pieces about dogs, hunting, lost kittens, cookouts, practical jokes, watching hawks, petty thefts, driving, drinking beer, and S and V on HBO. Essays that will stay in my memory include his account of a trip to New York to appear on the Today show when one of his books is published and learning while he's there that his wife and son have been hurt in a car accident, then discovering when he finds out they are OK that his dog Sam has died. The mental image of him crying in the airport is vivid and moving.<br />On a more hilarious note is an account of a long day's drive to a training exercise in the Delta, where they arrive late and drunk. On a more literary note, there's his account of setting up a hose to provide fake rain for a documentary film at William Faulkner's home, just down the road from the firehouse. His reflections on Faulkner sitting in the house and writing novels are full of awe and respect for a giant of letters, a giant who had a cup of coffee every night at a local restaurant where he always left a dime tip for the waitress.<br />If you've read or you're thinking of reading Brown's fiction, I recommend this book. It's a wonderful introduction to the man and his world, and  you get a sense of the raw material that feeds his imagination.ntary film at William Faulkner's home, just down the road from the firehouse.

A handful of shots include saddled horses with cowboys.<br /><br />The book has also been very handsomely designed. Page layout, typography, end papers, variety of image placement and use of white space, balancing of images and text, all serve the subject wonderfully and please the eye. Nearly all the photographs selected are crisply cear, motion frozen with a high-speed shutter. The wide pages make possible many double-page spreads that look and feel panoramic.<br />Editor Mark Spragg has brought together the work of seven writers, including himself, and an Assiniboine tale to accompany the images. The writings are mostly contemporary, but a few hark back to earlier times, such as Charley Russell's cowboy theory about the origins of horseback riding and Ben Green's account of trying to capture a band of mustangs, while nearly losing his hand to an infected horse bite. Spragg's harrowing essay &quot;Wintering&quot; appeared later in his collection of essays, &quot;Where Rivers Change Direction.&quot; There's also an informative essay by New York Times writer Verlyn Klinkenborg, who writes eloquently of the rural life and has visited wild-horse territory earlier in his book &quot;Making Hay.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this beautiful book to lovers of horses, good writing, and the Western landscape.	2003-02-14
US	51205644	R3DJZZ0J1LKDEC	0805027033	167241378	The Meadow	Books	5	33	35	N	N	A story of harsh extremities and stark beauty	This is a book to savor. Its chapters fall somewhere between vignettes and prose poems, and reading the book is like leafing through an album of old photographs. The storyline is made up of the threads of connections to be made between each of the word-pictures. The book itself seems to be neither fiction nor nonfiction. Galvin refers to himself and his family in some of the chapters, but the person at the center of the book is a neighbor, Lyle Van Waning, who has spent most of his life living near the meadow of the book's title, in the high elevations between Laramie, Wyoming, and Ft. Collins, Colorado.<br />By today's standards of urban comforts and conveniences (many of which have found their way into lives of people who live far from the city), Lyle lives a kind of pioneer existence, isolated much of the year by deep snow, living by his skills as a carpenter and builder, and the proceeds of hay harvested from his meadow, and spending the time when he can do neither of these in his shop making machinery parts, carved wooden boxes, firearms, and whatever else captures his fascination. He is an immensely private and self-sufficient man, who never marries and seems to hold in his heart the strongest connection with a dead sister who committed suicide. (A painting by Clara Van Waning appears on the cover of the book.) Galvin captures in Lyle the kind of fiercely independent spirit that made survivors of those who first settled and thrived in the American wilderness.<br />There are other men and women associated with the meadow. And their stories are also told, including App Worster and his son Ray, whose family owns the meadow before the Van Wanings, and who lose it during the Depression.  We also learn something of a neighboring rancher Frank Lilley, who is dying of cancer, and whose family continues to keep his ranch going. There's also Ferris, who tries the frontier patience of his neighbors to the breaking point by dumping truckloads of old appliances on his property and denuding his small pasture with over-grazing.<br />\\"The Meadow\\" is told with wonderful precision, a photographic attention to details, and a deep feeling for a kind of life that survives in spite of isolation and often hostile elements. While Galvin does not romanticize the lives of his characters, he does celebrate them. There's a deep attachment in this book to the region that is his home, the landscape and changing seasons, and the people who have put down roots there. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the West and the lives of those who have adapted to its harsh extremities and cherished its stark beauty. As a companion, I would recommend Mark Spragg's \\"Where Rivers Change Direction,\\" an account of growing up in northwest Wyoming.perty and denuding his small pasture with over-grazing.<br />\\"The Meadow\\" is told with wonderful precision, a photographic attention to details, and a deep feeling for a kind of life that survives in spite of isolation and often hostile elements.

The book is a good read, but it should probably come with instructions: \\"Some Assembly Required.\\" It's structured as a kind of picaresque novel, two men in a pickup (with a horse and a dog) traveling over Wyoming and some other western states in pursuit of a wife who has left home. Along the way, they are joined by a young Native American woman and a boy. This story is intercut with flashbacks to the boyhood and early youth of one of the men. And each section of the novel ends with a surreal dream sequence. How all these pieces fit together is kind of up to the reader.<br />There's material here that you'll find in the author's \\"Where Rivers Change Direction\\" and in his film script for \\"Everything That Rises\\" -- a rancher father and son, a man whose parents died when he was young, an old wise bachelor cowboy, the Wyoming landscape, the turn of seasons, horses, ranch work, accidents and injuries. And as in both those other works, Spragg reveals his wonderful gift for revealing character through dialogue. The book is worth reading just for how people talk to each other in a wry, ironic, self-deprecating way. And the precision in his observations of human behavior and the outdoors is in top form.<br />Compared to the thoughtful, interior quality of Spragg's essays, which really get you inside the mind of the writer, the novel is more cinematic. It gives vivid images of surfaces, and the inner life and motivations of the characters have to be surmised from their behavior, which is often quirky, impulsive, and upredictable. A rancher's wife loses her mind and disappears, the rancher commits suicide, a woman believes she is accompanied by a dead sister, a park ranger is attacked and left unconscious in a culvert, a man enters a convenience store and aims a rifle at the cashier. These things happen with little explanation, and the central character seems to feel that none is needed. I also found myself wanting a more inward look to understand the two middle-aged friends at the center of the story, who happen to love the same woman.<br />Still and all, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in modern-day western literature and first-rate writing. When Spragg is at his best, he's right on the money -- a man with too much to drink roping road signs from the back of a truck, a woman dying of cancer, the step-by-step process of replacing a corner post in a corral fence, the heat and dust behind the chutes at a rodeo, a boy caring for a friend with a broken foot in a snowstorm. As a companion, readers of this book would be interested in Gretel Ehrlich's novel \\"Heart Mountain\\". Set during the 1940s, it involves a similar love-struck bachelor cowboy living alone on a Wyoming ranch.rd look to understand the two middle-aged friends at the center of the story, who happen to love the same woman. <br />Still and all, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in modern-day western literature and first-rate writing.

US	51205644	R3KMTTBIRTHJCD	1573228257	381435705	Where Rivers Change Direction	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Fine writing by an excellent Wyoming essayist	Many fine things have been said here already about this collection of essays by a gifted and thoughtful writer. Spragg's memories of his boyhood are vivid and precise, and the narratives around which many of his essays are constructed are compelling and suspenseful, their resolutions often breathtaking. As just one example, the dangerous hunt for a wounded bear evolves into an evocation of a search-and-destroy mission in Vietnam.<br />There are many ways to read these essays -- as nature writing, coming of age memoir, record of a vanishing way of life. For me, the essays are most absorbing when Spragg tells of his teenage years, working in the all-male world of his father and the cowboys who work for him. They capture the awkwardness of learning to take on a man's responsibilities when they require a fearlessness and stoic toughness more common to pioneers and the Wild West than the urban environment of most of his contemporaries.<br /><br />There's a poignance that comes a bit clearer in the final essays, which skip forward in time to the author's middle years. Here you pick up a sense of something gone awry, a disillusionment and a good deal of personal anguish. There is a winter spent alone in a snowbound house as he recovers from a personal malaise identified by no more than the reference to severe leg pains. In the final chapters, he walks the back roads and irrigation ditches of Powell, Wyoming, in search of some measure of equanimity while his mother slowly dies of emphysema.<br />The title, \\"Where Rivers Change Direction,\\" seems to be a reference to the Continental Divide, and maybe also to the watersheds that emerge in all our lives and pull us with a gravitational force we don't recognize at the time and come to know only long afterward. I recommend this book to anyone interested in western literature, personal memoirs, gender studies, and finely crafted writing.	2003-01-02

Instead of a straightforward narrative from beginning to middle to end, it intermingles scenes from the lives of several characters told in flashbacks and flashforwards, all sequenced along the spine of a single plot line that involves the pursuit of a fugitive who has killed another man.<br />The location is northern Colorado and parts of Wyoming extending through the Great Divide Basin and northward into the mountains. The main characters are men with ties to the land -- a rancher, a cowboy, a doctor. Each is witness in his own way to the passing of the rural West and its replacement by land developers and the mining and logging industries.<br />They are also remnants of a code of honor that respects hard work, the individual, the land and its wildlife, and the values of courage, loyalty, and generosity. In particular, Galvin captures the nuances of friendship between these very individual men and the way matters of concern to them are often lightened with ironic and self-deprecating humor. I enjoyed this book and found myself caring very much for the welfare of its fugitive protagonist.<br />I recommend this novel to anyone with an interest in the modern West. As a companion book, I'd also recommend Frank Clifford's nonfiction book &quot;Backbone of the World: A Portrait of a Vanishing Way of Life Along the Continental Divide,&quot; which finds many of the same kinds of people from real life and explores in greater depth many of the land use issues raised by Galvin's book. As of this writing, &quot;Fencing the Sky&quot; seems to be going out of print. I'm hoping that it reappears shortly in paperback and has a new life for new readers in that format.	2002-12-13

In the current age of anxiety, Pema Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n is both a refreshing and challenging voice. Basically, she encourages us to see problems as spiritual opportunities. Instead of trying to run from discomfort, she advocates staying put and learning about ourselves. Instead of habitually reaching for whatever palliative gives relief -- always temporary -- she suggests feeling and observing our discomforts, becoming more fully present in our lives, learning how to be truly here now. Only through this process, she says, can we experience the deep joy of being alive.<br />This is a great companion volume to her book \\"When Things Fall Apart.\\" It elaborates on themes introduced there, describing several practices of Tibetan Buddhism, some ancient and long forgotten, which help us not only cope with anxiety but use it to overcome fearfulness. This is an important spiritual effort because while we typically think of hate as the enemy of love, it is really fear that makes love difficult. Fear immobilizes us, makes us pull the covers over our heads, and isolates us from others.<br />Ch&ouml;dr&ouml;n, a student of Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa, encourages the consistent practice of meditation. And she discounts the usual results-driven expectations people associate with it, pointing out that as we confront our true selves in meditation, it often becomes more and more difficult, not easier. And for those who have found meditation fiercely frustrating, as I have, she has alternatives. The practice of \\"tonglen\\" is one simple spiritual ritual that can be done anywhere, anytime, providing a dramatic and freeing shift in emotional perspective. Learning not to let disappointment, anger, and hurt trigger our personal melodramas, which sap our energy, we can find our way to greater equanimity and become a less destructive presence in the world.<br />I strongly recommend this book as a welcome spiritual tonic in troubled times, whether that trouble originates elsewhere or from within. As with her other books, you can read and reread it, each time discovering much to learn and reflect on -- and in her words, \\"this is news you can use.\\"h her other books, you can read and reread it, each time discovering much to learn and reflect on -- and in her words, \\"this is news you can use.\\"	2002-11-16

He calls it the Official Style; it's practiced whenever writers want to sound important, and to achieve this effect inflate what they write like Macy's Parade balloons. His &quot;Paramedic Method&quot; of rescuing hyper-inflated prose is directed in this slender volume to writers of business communications: memos, reports, policies, procedures, you name it. By following his advice step by step, it's possible to achieve directness, clarity, even simplicity by finding the plain English that neatly expresses what we want to say. And that means finding and disposing of all the unnecessary verbiage, which by Lanham's estimate comprises about 50% of what we write.<br />Take the following cumbersome sentence, the likes of which routinely typify everyday business communications: &quot;On the basis of the answers to these and other questions which the team might ask, I would expect the team to present us with detailed recomendations for enhancing the effectiveness of our reporting.&quot; Lanham shows how to transform it into something elegantly precise: &quot;By answering questions like these, the team should be able to recommend improvements in our reporting.&quot; A reduction, he would be quick to point out, from 34 words to 16 words. True, as the saying goes, it takes longer to write something shorter, but the finished product is more likely to be read, understood, and acted upon by its intended audience.<br />Lanham's approach to all this is hardly stuffy. He has a good time poking fun at egregious examples of ponderous prose, and he also has a good time whacking it into something presentable. And the end result isn't just readable; it's alive, full of energy, and packs a wallop. This book is for every business person who has something important to say and wants to be sure that what they've written gets read rather than shoved to the side because it's a chore to plow through. Buy this book, read it, and reread it. You won't be sorry.d it. You won't be sorry.	2002-11-01

James Hillman is often thought of as a demanding and difficult writer -- in need of being \\"popularized\\" by someone like Thomas Moore (\\"Care of the Soul\\") to reach a wider audience. And there may be some truth to this, but Hillman can also be remarkably accessible, as in this thought-provoking book on the \\"intelligent uses\\" of power.<br />We may think that power needs no explanation. It is what it is. But, as Hillman points out, that belief gives it unconscoius power over us. Never examining power, we do not see the many ways it permeates our daily lives, influencing our behavior and our choices. If we think of power as \\"force,\\" we do not appreciate its subtler uses, e.g., influence, authority, or energy, and we do not see that problems about power may have a wide array of solutions.<br />Hillman is fascinated by words, because words represent ideas; embedded in words are the entire histories of ideas. He is also fascinated by the process of \\"entertaining\\" ideas, and this book is a record of one brilliant and mercurial mind entertaining the idea of power, examining the many ways we can look at it (he devotes a chapter to each of 24 \\"kinds of power\\"), as well as the way its various meanings govern how we see the world around us. For instance, ideas about power lead individuals or groups of people to regard themselves as disempowered (victims); ideas about power may underlie the desire to own guns.<br />Because economic power rules the lives of almost everyone (yet another idea about power), Hillman directs his book to anyone involved with businesss. And he means business in the broadest sense of that word -- anyone whose life is structured by the getting and spending of money. Looking into mythology for insights into the psychology of power, he opens up this subject as therapist and patient might do in a series of 50-minute sessions. It's not a how-to book, but rather a journey, taking the reader across a landscape (both personal and collective) that offers many new and freeing perspectives.nd freeing perspectives.	2002-10-26

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Lick and Cody's excellent adventure	Most reviewers talk about this book as bust-a-gut hilarious, which it certainly is at points, but it's also a whole lot more than that. If you have an interest in rodeo cowboys and their life on the road between those hoped-for 8 seconds of adrenalin in the arena, this book is primarily about that. Exaggerated, you bet, but compared to the yarns told in Bill St. John's book of real rodeo cowboys, &quot;On Down the Road,&quot; not all that much.<br />Baxter Black captures and celebrates the comical that exists in the self-deprecating and unpretentious manner of cowboys. The story of his two cowboy pals doing the summer rodeo circuit all over the western states, with hopes of winning enough money to make it to the national finals, explores that rich vein of American humor between guts and glory and human comedy. There is a fine line between fearlessness and foolishness, and few sports make failure not only ignominious but dangerous (being thrown and getting not only a faceful of dirt but broken bones to boot). It's no accident that in the rodeo arena the hardest working cowboys are surely the clowns.<br />Black's book achieves one other enjoyable objective; it represents the friendship between two men, a subject that has found its way into the buddy movie, but is seldom treated in literature of any kind. These two guys are different enough to play off each other's strengths and weaknesses, but they're no odd couple. Their devotion to each other, their companionship on the road, their late night talks attempting to make sense of the world they inhabit -- not to mention their adventures with porcupines and &quot;wild women&quot; -- all of it is an entertaining celebration of being best pals.<br />St. John's book about rodeo cowboys is out of print, but if you can find a copy, I heartily recommend it as a companion to this wonderfully entertaining novel by Baxter Black.	2002-10-19

Linguists, most of them scholars and academics, tend to accept that language is in a continuing state of evolution and change. They consider this the natural state of language, and that any attempt to stop change with a set of rigid grammatical rules and notions of standards is either counterproductive or simply wrong-headed.<br />Lined up against them is a more traditionalist army of grammarians, plain language enthusiasts, and keepers of &quot;correct&quot; usage, who feel that change is undesirable and that the laissez-faire attitude of linguists is an invitation to cultural chaos. These two groups have been at loggerheads for decades, each deeply suspicious of the other.<br />Along comes Deborah Cameron, a linguist at Strythclyde University (UK) who decides to take a more open-minded look at the attitudes of the traditionalists and offers her colleagues a number of insights meant to scale down the level of hostility between the two camps. Her central notion is there in the title: verbal hygiene.<br />She proposes that not only does language evolve; it generates its own &quot;caregivers.&quot; These people look after its welfare, wrong-headed or not, and practice a kind of &quot;hygiene&quot; that counteracts the messiness of uncontrolled growth. The evolution of language, she says, is actually a dynamic between opposing forces of conservation and innovation. While there is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; way to use language, Cameron suggests that language is enlivened by the push and pull between these opposing ideas.<br />To challenge the idea that standard English exists apart from the people who use it, she provides an account for how it comes into being, at least as she sees it among UK writers. And she challenges the confident trust we might have in the use of dictionaries as a measure of &quot;correctness.&quot; Reading her analysis, you realize that dictionaries are part of a circular process that both reflects and determines usage.<br />Cameron extends her discussion of language with insightful and entertaining analyses of &quot;political correctness,&quot; communication between genders, and the types of politically-inspired public hysteria that spring up around the schools' perceived failure to teach correct grammar. She even takes to task our confident acceptance of George Orwell's dictums in his often cited essay, &quot;Politics and the English Language.&quot;<br />This is a book for anyone fascinated by not only the language of politics but the politics of language. Its ideas are argued thoughtfully and with considerable insight.

My wife and I took a cross country trip from California to Pennsylvania and back, with this book at our side, and its restaurant/diner/take-out recommendations took us off the beaten track into culinary adventures we still talk about.<br />We found the Sterns about 90% reliable in their choices, with a few wonderful picks that more than made up the difference. As fans of regional BBQ, we were delighted by a variety out-of-the-way, down-home purveyors of this mouth-watering soul food, from Oklahoma to Arkansas to (even) South Dakota. Our favorite wide-spot-in-the-road place served up both meat and coleslaw on the same bun, with a side of beans; across the street were fresh-baked pies still warm from the oven.<br />Perhaps the most enjoyable discovery (thanks to the Sterns) was the dining room of the Inn at Pleasant Hill, near Harrodsburg, KY, where the lemon pie was beyond description, and after the meal, at sunset, we took a leisurely stroll around the tranquil grounds of what once was a large, thriving Shaker community.<br />The book has handy regional maps, for finding those towns you've never heard of, and the descriptions of each establishment are pretty accurate (I found only one place that was not what I expected). The listings were largely up-to-date; only one restaurant had moved, which I found out when I called for directions. (In fact, a cell phone is definitely a plus for finding some places.)<br />If you're looking for something near where you live, this book may disappoint you. It will probably list the places you already know (e.g., in Los Angeles, Du-Par's at Farmers Market and Phillipe's downtown). The West Coast, for that matter, seems somewhat under-represented. But if you're willing to get off the interstate far from home and take your chances, the book is an enjoyable adventure guide.<br />Two recommendations: Take along a books-on-tape copy of Kerouac's &quot;On the Road&quot; and a cooler for left-overs -- some places haven't heard of portion control.ouac's &quot;On the Road&quot; and a cooler for left-overs -- some places haven't heard of portion control.	2002-10-06

And given the times we live in, its subject matter is particularly timely for American readers -- the period of history leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the early years of the war effort -- all told from the point of view of a thoughtful writer on a small farm in Maine.<br />White had moved there with his wife and young son from New York, where he'd been writing for The New Yorker, and took up country living, turning his attention to the annual round of the seasons, farm work, the nearby seaside, and the company of independent rural people. Most of the essays in this collection were written and published monthly in Harpers from July 1938 to January 1943. In them, there is White's awareness of the ominous threat of fascism emerging in Europe, as well as the vulnerability that Americans felt as they found themselves facing prolonged armed conflict with powerful enemies. These were dark days, and they provide a constant undertone in these otherwise upbeat essays about rural and small-town life.<br />And they are upbeat, celebrating the pleasures and gentle ironies of daily life with a few side trips into the world beyond -- the birth of a lamb, paying taxes, farm dogs, hay fever, raising chickens, Sunday mornings, radio broadcasts, civil defense drills, a visit to Walden pond, a day at the World's Fair, and unrealistic Hollywood portrayals of the pastoral. There is also here his famous essay \\"Once More to the Lake.\\"<br />In many ways, the world he writes about is gone forever. But it's a world whose spirit remains at the heart of the national identity -- participatory democracy, individualism, citizenship, self-discovery, and self-reliance. Reading these essays, while they are often about seemingly trivial matters, you sense White's deepening faith in the American Experiment -- a belief in America as a work in progress.<br />And, of course, there is the famous White style, both simple and elegant. Its language, sentence structure, and movement of thought convey both sharpness of mind and generosity of spirit, in a manner that looks and sounds easy, but it is very hard to imitate. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the WWII homefront, the essay as a literary form, and a curiosity about rural life before farm subsidies and agribusiness.e is the famous White style, both simple and elegant.

Young adults, whose parents would have stuck with a marriage come hell or high water, now divorce and drift through relationships. Their parents tied to the land and other life-long occupations, Mason's post-war generation is less rooted, freed of conventional beliefs, but often at a loss about what to believe in. Most striking as America grows increasingly urban, Mason's people continue to inhabit a rural landscape -- more worldly than their forebears, but not more sophisticated.<br />While some readers of Mason's stories and novels may have been puzzled by the point of view in them (ironic? matter of fact? sentimental?), this wonderful memoir should do much to clear up that ambiguity. Here a reader is introduced to the world of day-to-day experience that these narratives have emerged from. And you can begin to see how the matter of fact, ironic, and sentimental blend into a perspective that is distinctly rural American. The strongest individual (who is surely the source of many of Mason's fictional characters) is without doubt her mother, a remarkable woman with a quizzical sense of humor, a colorful manner of speaking, and a long view that comes of witnessing much of the 20th century at first hand.<br />A list of highlights in this book would go on for pages; there's just so much to savor and enjoy. There's Mason's own unsophisticated childhood (barefoot summers, crushes on pop stars, rock and roll fandom), the making of the film \\"In Country,\\" and the continuing transformation of the rural Kentucky environment from horse-and-buggy days to the invasion of agribusiness -- a huge processing plant has sprung up across the road from the family farm.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Mason's fiction. It is rich with thoughtful and well-observed detail reaching back across three generations of family history.back across three generations of family history.	2002-10-05

Set in a rural Southern community, the story follows the attempt of its young heroine Sam to solve the mystery of her father, who died before she knew him, a casualty of the war. Meanwhile, her curiosity is piqued by her uncle Emmett who did return from that war, but is still haunted by it and languishes in a kind of noncommunicative and prolonged bout with post traumatic stress.<br />Independent and single-minded, like Nancy, Sam looks for clues and tries to piece them together. There are photographs, letters, and mementos to collect and ponder. Eventually, she tries to simulate the experience of being \\"in country,\\" spending a night in the swamp, hoping to recreate for herself the fear and bravery of the young soldier far from home who was her father.<br />Finally, it is a family trip to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C., that brings them all closer to resolution. And while it may not solve a mystery, or the conundrum of the Vietnam War itself, they are drawn closer to the enigma of human life and the need to honor the past while also letting go of it.	2002-10-05

Marcy, the girl who becomes his sweetheart, strives for a hard-won personal independence from her hard-working farmer parents. Their late-night lovemaking and eventual marriage are an against-all-odds attempt to save themselves from being swallowed up by the indifference of the natural world and the conventional expectations of the small town world they inhabit.<br />What pleased me most about this book was how often it took unexpected turns. Given the explosiveness of young Randall's character, his insensitiviy, and his distrust of others, his growth to manhood, steady and responsible, is a welcome surprise. So is his loyalty to Marcy and his willingness to regard her as an equal in love and marriage, even letting her leave him for an adventure of her own in California. Her discovery of him asleep in his pickup, parked in the driveway at her apartment house, the smell of rural Nebraska still filling the cab, is a wonderful moment of the bond that holds them together and to their home.<br /><br />Another long sequence in the novel describes a hunting party that grows progressively unnerving, as some of the more trigger-happy in the group get steadily drunker and more frustrated at the lack of game. There is an ominous threat of trouble as you follow them, page after page, and McNeal waits until much later in the novel to reveal the eventual dark deeds of the day, throwing Randall's future unexpectedly into question for a time.<br />I think this book compares well with Kent Haruf's better known novel \\"Plain Song.\\" The landscape and setting are very similar; so are the themes and the evocative language; and the rural and small-town characters are drawn with equal depth, compassion, and psychological realism.

Yes, Bergner uses a prison rodeo as the structural device to build this account of prison life around. But it's not any kind of rodeo you would see authorized by the PRCA. The events are more treacherous, and the men who participate have no experience. They are a spectacle for a crowd of people looking for the same kind of thrills that drew ancient Romans to the Coliseum.<br />The book is chiefly about the daily lives of several of the prisoners who happen to participate in this spectacle, as Bergner follows them over the period of a year at Louisiana's maximum security prison, Angola. Bergner is permitted to talk to them one-on-one, with no guards present, by an unusual warden with a reputation for his \\"humane\\" philosophy of incarceration and his efforts at rehabilitation. The interviews, as a result, or more than usually candid. One prisoner even fantasizes aloud to Bergner about escaping and taking revenge on the people who put him there.<br />Not all the prisoners Bergner introduces us to are reprehensible. Most, in fact, seem decent enough blokes, and he has to keep reminding us (and himself) that all of them are serving time for violent, awful crimes. Most are black men, reflecting the racial (im)balance of the prison population. And most struggle daily to maintain a sense of self-worth that society and the judicial and penal systems have denied them. One man becomes active in the prison's chapter of Toastmasters. Another attends church services for a time. One holds out the hope that his teenage son will find a way to be proud of him. One romances a woman with two children who eventually marries him in a prison ceremony.<br />Unexpectedly, in the middle of the narrative, the prison warden begins to pressure Bergner for editorial privileges. He wants only good publicity and perhaps suspects that Bergner has uncovered some shady dealings involving labor provided by prisoners to business associates. What starts as a congenial relationship between the two men turns sour, and Bergner has to take his case to a sympathetic state prison commissioner, who reinstates his privileges, no strings attached.<br />The book ends as it begins with the annual rodeo. By now we know how the hope of winning a buckle feeds the participants' desire to compete and succeed. We also see the shabby futility of the event and regret ever yearning along with them for a moment of personal glory.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who has the slightest interest in what happens to men who are sent to prison. Bergner has written a fascinating account of lives spent year after year behind bars. As a companion volume, I would recommend Ted Conover's \\"Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing,\\" which gives an account of prison life told from the point of view of the men and women who work as guards.ates.

It's Hemingway over ice with a splash of bitters. If you love language, you will read every word. Much also has been said about this book as an accurate portrayal of flying and a great novel of warfare.<br />What I would add to all that is how &quot;The Hunters&quot; is a fascinating account of the dynamics within a group of highly trained men who engage in a high-risk occupation. The central character Cleve begins the novel as a well respected flyer, a cut above the rest, and admired by the less experienced men around him. Fiercely independent and reserved, he has a somewhat aloof personal style that makes him all the more respected and even idolized.<br />Enter a younger, hotshot flyer, brash and egotistical, the opposite of Cleve in every respect -- and, we are led to believe, somewhat less than honorable -- who quickly establishes himself as an equal to Cleve, determined to be seen by the commanding officers as superior. The rest of the novel is a psychological study of &quot;grace under pressure&quot; and the eventual failure of Cleve to maintain his position in this hierarchy of men, where the respect of others is the reason for being.<br />This drama of the individual against a closed social order that first praises and then abandons him is compelling from beginning to end. I recommend the book not only to readers looking for well-written accounts of air warfare. Its nuanced portrayal of the shifting dynamics among men in an all-male setting makes it excellent material for gender studies, as well. For another Salter book that picks up some of these same themes and writes about them just as eloquently, read his novel &quot;Solo Faces.&quot;	2002-09-28

Dietrich D&ouml;rner is an authority on cognitive behavior and a psychology professor at the University of Bamberg, Germany. His research shows that our habits as problem solvers are typically counterproductive.<br /><br />Probably our main shortcoming is that we like to oversimplify problems. D&ouml;rner offers a long list of self-defeating behaviors, but common to all of them is our reluctance to see any problem is part of a whole system of interacting factors. Any problem is much more complex than we like to believe. And failure doesn't have to come from incompetence. The operators of the Chernobyl reactor, as D&ouml;rner points out, were &quot;experts.&quot; And as experts, they ignored safety standards because they &quot;knew what they were doing.&quot;<br /><br />D&ouml;rner identifies four habits of mind and characteristics of thought that account for the frequency of our failures:<br />1. The slowness of our thinking-We streamline the process of problem solving to save time and energy.<br />2. Our wish to feel confident and competent in our problem solving abilities-We try to repeat past successes.<br />3. Our inability to absorb quickly and retain large amounts of information-We prefer unmoving mental models, which cannot capture a dynamic, ever-changing process.<br />4. Our tendency to focus on immediately pressing problems-We ignore the problems our solutions will create.<br /><br />Successful problem solving is so complex that there are no hard-and-fast rules that work all the time. The best take-away from the book (and this is my favorite quote): &quot;An individual's reality model can be right or wrong, complete or incomplete. As a rule it will be both incomplete and wrong, and one would do well to keep that probability in mind.&quot; The book is 199 easy-to-read pages, and D&ouml;rner gives lots of interesting examples from lab tests illustrating people's actual behavior in problem-solving situations.<br />It's a thought-provoking book for anyone whose job is to tackle complex problems.

To begin with, even though I had heard most of a radio interview with the author, I was expecting a book mostly about hiking the Rocky Mountains. Instead \\"Backbone of the World\\" is about a series of encounters with people who live and work along the Continental Divide. And Clifford uses these encounters to discuss the competing points of view of those with an interest in what's left of America's wilderness areas -- environmentalists, housing developers, ranchers, cowboys, sheep herders, national park service rangers, wildlife preservationists, back country outfitters, hunters, Native Americans, game wardens, hangers on in dying company towns, and the owners and employees of the mining, logging, and energy industries.<br />As a journalist for the Los Angeles Times, Clifford has his preferences about the fate of the wilderness, but he allows his subjects to speak for themselves without passing judgment on them. To that extent, the book is not a polemic but an array of human opinions nearly as sweeping as the mountain and desert vistas that are the subject of this book. He goes on horseback into the mountains of northern Montana with Blackfeet Indians. He spends time with a sheep herder in Colorado, who is barely scraping by. He is the guest of two ranch owners, riding along on a cattle drive in Wyoming and helping with a round-up in New Mexico, in the arid high country along the Mexican border. He goes coyote hunting with an ailing and broken former uranium mining worker in Wyoming. He visits a park ranger in Yellowstone, who spends his days busting illegal hunters. And he accompanies an environmental activist as they pony trek into the mountains of Alberta.<br />And as the people he interviews speak, you learn of the impact of humans on the wilderness -- overgrazing, destruction of habitat, the invasion of roads and all-terrain vehicles, the decimation of wildlife populations, the spread of urban sprawl, the expansion of the recreation industry, the hunting camps where big city executives can shoot game that have been lured off public lands with conveniently located salt licks. And over and again, there is the theme of a ravaged landscape, diminished by clear-cutting, exhausted mines, and aggressive drilling for oil and gas. At this level, the book is a quiet litany for the destruction of everything wild, pristine, and beautiful.<br />All this may sound like a depressing read, but I enjoyed Clifford's accounts of encounters with the people who inhabit this region. He puts a human face on the economic, environmentalist, and conservationist forces in contention over the fate of what once was a vast wilderness. The 8-page bibliography at the end of the book is evidence of his long and thoughtful study of his subject. And his writing is that of an observant journalist. The people and places he describes come alive, and like viewing an excellent documentary film, you come away with an appreciation for the complexity of the issues, a sense of having witnessed them firsthand, and your own assumptions turned upside down.of wildlife populations, the spread of urban sprawl, the expansion of the recreation industry, the hunting camps where big city executives can shoot game that have been lured off public lands with conveniently located salt licks.

In time, however, he discovers that Adam was born with FAS, a condition Dorris knows very little about. Believing that proper care can reverse the effects of FAS, he takes on the daunting and nearly futile task of helping Adam achieve a \\"normal\\" boyhood. The damage done, it turns out, is irreversible; Adam is almost maddeningly unable to learn simple tasks and responsibilities. FAS-related health problems, including seizures, often turn merely difficult days and nights into nightmares for the single father.<br />The book Dorris writes is meant as an eye-opener for readers who are unaware of the potential harm in consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Given naturally to research and study, he shares with the reader much of what he learns about FAS and the Native American culture that has had such a fatal connection with alcohol. To that extent, this is almost a textbook on the subject.<br />But this is also the story of a father and son, and most poignant, for this reader, is the relationship between them that is a thread throughout the book. Dorris never surrenders to the barriers that exist between him and his son. Having taken responsibility for Adam, he gives his all to making even the smallest difference in the boy's life. It's a heroic effort and often heartbreaking.	2002-09-04

Or the electronic cottage, where workers become telecommuters and never have to change out of their pajamas? And what about those claims by Internet enthusiasts who predicted the end of the &quot;old economy&quot;?<br /><br />Why is it that organizational models for running a business keep going in and out of fashion? What was wrong with total quality management? Process reengineering? Flattened organizational structures? Computer scientist John Seely Brown and social scientist Paul Duguid have some thought-provoking answers to these questions.<br /><br />Brown has long been associated with Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and is currently its director. Duguid is a research specialist in Education at UC Berkeley. And they're neither cranks nor nay-sayers. Both are firm advocates of change. They just want to point out what they consider to be some myths about information technology.<br />Brown and Duguid suggest that information technology's enthusiasts don't honor the difference between information and knowledge. Some people &quot;know&quot; what they're talking about; some don't. Knowledge is information with a context, which includes the person or people who have it. As Brown and Duguid say, you can't separate knowledge from the knower.<br />We forget that communication involves negotiation and then don't understand why others can't always accept what we say at face value. To illustrate, Brown retells the story of how the graphic user interface (GUI) developed at Xerox PARC was misunderstood and unappreciated by the rest of the company -- only to be embraced and taken to market by Apple.<br /><br />The truth about learning is that it's social. You may read something in a manual or book or newspaper. It may seem like you're doing something by yourself. Just collecting information. But what you read was first made sense of by other people -- writers and editors. They used their own judgment and experience to decide what was worth putting into words and then how to organize it for your consumption. This is all the work of knowledge.<br /><br />To illustrate that knowledge is a group activity, the authors describe a community of Xerox copier technicians, who developed an ongoing body of knowledge about servicing copiers that was not covered in their training. In essence a support group, they met informally before and after work for shop talk. And they discussed their experience of copiers with widely different problems. Some were so complex they required the knowledge of two technicians working in collaboration.<br />Acting as individuals, using only their training, they wouldn't have been able to do their jobs. The training was, in fact, only information. Tried and tested against copiers &quot;in the real world,&quot; then shared within an unofficial &quot;community of practice,&quot; information became knowledge.<br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone in knowledge management, education, IT, or training, because it shakes up so many assumptions about the information economy and knowledge transfer.

From the earliest stages, through the difficult decision to proceed with a bone marrow transplant, and the agonizing months of treatment and recovery that follow, he takes the reader by the hand through an emotionally and physically harrowing ordeal. Through it all, his life hangs in the balance, and he's written his story so well that you have to keep reminding yourself that he's had to survive the experience to write the book you're reading.<br />This is not to say that you don't step back now and then and realize that you're not reading the story of a typical patient. Biro clearly has all sorts of advantages by being a doctor, with numerous personal connections in medicine, including a father who is a doctor. Biro gets privileged treatment all along the way, including the advice of two specialists whom he's actually able to get together in the same room to discuss his case from their differing points of view.<br />In retrospect, you also realize that Biro has glossed over a remarkable stroke of good fortune -- his younger sister's being a perfect match as a bone marrow donor. While he praises his family for their tireless support at his bedside throughout his time as a patient, you feel that he also takes a great deal of this attentiveness for granted, especially the very painful procedure that his sister undergoes to be his lifesaver.<br />But in spite of these misgivings, a reader is likely to feel thoroughly absorbed by Biro's story. He does, after all, have to endure weeks of physical pain and discomfort, all the while knowing that he might not survive at all. It's OK for him to be more self-centered than maybe we'd prefer.<br />This is an excellent book for anyone in the healthcare professions, as it depicts graphically the experience of being a patient and having to endure treatment that is as life threatening as the disease being treated. As a companion to this book, I'd recommend the play \\"Wit,\\" about a dying cancer patient, by Margaret Edson, also made into an HBO film by Mike Nichols, starring Emma Thompson.ife threatening as the disease being treated.

For anyone who's been a patient, there's some satisfaction in reading stories like this in which an ill or injured doctor finds out \\"what it's really like\\" to be in a hospital bed and more or less at the mercy of the medical profession.<br />I suppose Oliver Sacks isn't quite a likely candidate for this tables-turned scenario. In his books and TV interviews (e.g., \\"Glorious Accident\\"), and in Robin Williams' portrayal of him in \\"Awakenings,\\" he comes across as anything but the stereotypical doctor. But he learns plenty from his experience anyway, and not just from the imperious surgeon who insists that there's nothing wrong with Sacks now that his leg has been repaired or the jolly hockey-stick nurse who is copeless when he does not respond to physical therapy.<br />He also learns first hand the terror of being injured, alone, and far from any other humans to rescue him. He experiences the helplessness that can overwhelm a person who not only loses the use of a limb, but as a \\"patient,\\" loses his identity as an independent person. Sacks' descriptions of his feelings as a patient, sometimes soaring, sometimes despairing, are vividly told and are a reminder to any healthcare worker of the wild fluctuations of emotions that a patient can experience, even from one hour to the next.<br />Another fascinating aspect of the book is its account of the mystery of healing. Sacks describes in great detail the slow and unpredictable experience of recovering the ability to walk again. And he gives special consideration to the process of \\"re-entry,\\" as he spends time in a sanatorium, among others who are healing, finally venturing out into the world on his own to rediscover himself and his lost independence.<br />Sacks is a vivid and analytical writer, with a rich gift of language. This is a slender book, but much is packed into it. It is a journey through the looking glass for any healthcare worker who has never been hospitalized with a serious and debilitating injury or illness, and should be required reading.but much is packed into it.

The author, Brother Benet Tvedten entered as a novitiate in 1958, shortly after graduating from college. In this gracefully and simply written book about monastery life, Tvedten looks back over a half century that was witness to the sweeping changes ushered in by Vatican II.<br />He recalls the impact of these changes, when English took the place of Latin in worship, the number of hours spent daily in silence were reduced, and rigid hierarchies were replaced by an egalitarian spirit more in keeping with the rules originally set down by St. Benedict in the 6th century. Tvedten remembers that monks were once unable to read the weekly magazine in the Sunday newspaper because they might see revealing ads for women's undergarments. The monks today, he notes, have ready access to secular publications, including the Sports Illustrated annual swimsuit issue.<br />Without much effort, he dispels any illusions of pious other-worldliness the reader might hold about modern-day monks. He describes the quirks and all-too-human behavior of individuals who have chosen to live together as family - never too far from dysfunctional, including disputes over the TV. His book is richly detailed with profiles of the strong personalities who have lived their lives within the walls of his monastery. Noting that monastic community thrives on a rich oral history, he fills his book with the stories that are told and retold about the brothers - stories remembered even more warmly after they have gone.<br />There's a wry sense of humor throughout this collection of short essays on various and sundry topics: pet dogs, dining out, going to the movies, friendship, answering the phone, reading aloud at meals, getting the giggles during service, how monks get their names, where to put your hands in your robe. They are simple topics, often profound when they least seem so. They are told with a clear and unsentimental love of everyday life and gratitude for a community that gives ample opportunity to indulge that love.when they least seem so.

The situation is simple: a young man, Bob Hampton, is lost. Beyond his wish to be a painter, he's keenly aware that he has no direction for either life or career and some doubt that he'll ever find one. Telling himself that he's raising some cash for art school, he hires himself out as a handyman. The clients who enlist his services are people whose lives are a mess. They are even more lost than Bob. And it turns out that he's much better at bringing order and self-sufficiency to their lives than to his own.<br />Carolyn See has a comic vision and a compassion for her characters that is hard to resist. She sends Bob careening from one dysfunctional household to another, fixing things that don't work, painting, gardening, running errands. And in the process, he has his own journey of self-discovery. Unexpectedly, Bob's jobs call for heroics and the patience of a saint. He saves a toddler from drowning, rescues an abandoned wife who can't drive a car or write a check, helps a widow discard her dead husband's belongings and discover a new life, and comes to the aid of two copeless young men, one of them in failing health.<br />In addition to his clients, the cast of characters includes his young housemates, whose transient lives converge improbably under the same roof. There is also his forlorn mother, staring blankly from her apartment window into the street below. The novel captures the bruising heat of summer in LA and the peculiar impermanence of a city where people's attachments are temporary, and creative inspiration can materialize in visions hovering over the traffic on Santa Monica Boulevard or across the concrete surrounding a backyard swimming pool.<br />Finally, The Handyman is a feel-good novel that encourages a kinder, gentler view of the City of Angels and the people who - even temporarily - call it home.	2002-08-24

His account is of being the only infectious diseases physician in a rural community at a time when the first wave of HIV-positive gay men were returning to their hometowns from New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. His observations of the men and women who come to him for care, and the relationships that have grown between them, are insightful and vivid. Though he is heterosexual and married with two small children, his intuitive compassion for people with AIDS is a lesson in what it is to be nonjudgmental.<br />However, the crisis for him is to live in a place and time where his curiosity and compassion are shared by almost no one else, both within and outside his professional community. Through his work, he comes to a deeper understanding of homophobia and the irrationality that drives people's fear of disease and disability. As an African-born Indian, happily Americanized, he finds in the social isolation of his patients something of his own status as an \\"outsider.\\" We also see the demands that professional commitments can make on marriage and parenting.<br />An outgoing and obviously dedicated, self-sacrificing physician, the author is slowly overcome by the growing solitude of his professional and personal journey and the weariness of battling a disease with no cure. Although sometimes a triumph of dignity against all odds, the deaths of his patients are heart-breaking. This is a richly detailed book full of suspense, sorrow, and humor and beautifully written.	2002-08-24

This time, instead of traveling with undocumented field workers and hoboes, he takes a job as a prison guard (\\"corrections officer\\" is the preferred term) to learn something of the inner workings of the American penal system. Over a period of eight months, after his training, he is assigned to what is apparently the most volatile, chaotic, and fabled prisons in NY state, Sing Sing.<br />At least one reviewer said of this book when it was first published that the author had compromised his objectivity by being a participant in the subject he was reporting on. By becoming a prison guard, he loses sight of the perspective of the prisoners, and a not-so-subtle bias creeps into what he writes. In fact, I think that's what makes this book so interesting.<br />What Conover gives us is a rueful, often painful, sometimes humorous account of his own transformation as a \\"newjack\\" corrections officer, dealing daily with frustration, danger, and the absurdities of life in prison. His viewpoint is the difference between the war correspondent and the grunt in the trenches. You get a direct glimpse into the hearts and minds of prison guards and acquire some understanding of how they see the world they inhabit, as well as the toll it takes on them as individuals.<br />I say \\"glimpse\\" because many of the men and women in this book have made a career of corrections. Some of them are survivors of prison revolts; at least two were taken hostage. Given the self-protection that the profession requires, they reveal little to Conover, except what he can read from their sometimes inscrutable behavior. Even so, Conover successfully breaks down the popular stereotypes of prison guards. After reading the book, you take the news of someone's being sent to prison somewhat differently. Instead of seeing them behind bars, you become aware of the men and women immediately responsible hour-by-hour for their incarceration.<br />I heartily recommend this book. As you read, you wonder at Conover's sometimes foolhardy nerve and have only the book in your hands as evidence that he somehow survives the ordeal he has assigned himself. As a companion to this book, I also recommend Daniel Bergner's \\"God of the Rodeo,\\" an equally compelling account of life inside Louisiana's Angola Prison.hour-by-hour for their incarceration.<br />I heartily recommend this book.

It is an informative and well illustrated survey covering almost 200 years of pictorial representations of the American frontier.<br />Because of my interest in the mythology that developed around the cowboy, I found the chapters on Frederic Remington, Charley Russell, and Buffalo Bill Cody especially absorbing. Magazine illustrators who further developed imagery of the &quot;wild west&quot; are represented here in discussions of N. C. Wyeth and Maynard Dixon.<br />On a parallel track, the authors give a chapter to the early silent Westerns, highlighting the careers and contributions of Tom Mix and William S. Hart (a precursor of Clint Eastwood). Another chapter is devoted to the Hollywood Western during the sound era noting similarities between Remington's imagery and that of director John Ford. There's also a discussion of the evolution of western movie themes from &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1929) to &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot; (1969).<br />This book is a rewarding study of the American West as its visual artists inspired the imaginations of people around the world. Definitely worth having.	2002-08-15

But it's not just a picture book. The author Bill St. John is a sports writer, and he covers the subject with the kind of depth you expect from good sports writing.<br />His specialty is getting up-close and personal with the greats and near-greats of the sport (e.g., Larry Mahan, Donnie Gay, Jim Shoulders, Leo Camarillo), following them around, traveling with them from rodeo to rodeo, sitting up with them in motel rooms late at night, listening to their stories, and capturing their personalities in the way they talk, tell jokes, even sing songs.<br />St. John gives plenty of attention to the events themselves and the action in the arena, including the work of the rodeo clowns, but there's a great deal more about what goes on behind the scenes. He even devotes a chapter to rodeo stock. If you're interested in the excitement of rodeoing and the lives and personal histories of the men and women who \\"go on down the road,\\" this book is a great read. Find a copy, if you can, and hang onto it.	2002-08-13

We see the world through his eyes, and we see how well it serves him, keeping him wealthy and comfortable. While he may notice that some suffer and are oppressed, he is not moved to do anything that would make a difference for them. Instead, he justifies his indifference with a sense of racial and class superiority.<br />Gordimer captures the mental framework of someone who feels little or nothing for the misfortunes of others. What is interesting for the reader is that it requires an effort to step out of his mind and see his thoughts and behavior for what they are -- insensitive, self-serving, and at times brutal.<br />Gordimer finds him at a time in his life when he is middle-aged and living alone, no longer married, his grown son estranged from him, and his mistress not all that endeared to him. While money, property, and influence keep him at a safe distance from the political troubles slowly encroaching on his private world, Gordimer reveals his physical and emotional isolation. His defense is to cut his losses and retreat even farther into his solitary world. It's a fascinating, well-written character study.	2002-08-11

Through them you learn of the complexity of the problems created by apartheid and the range of social issues rooted in a system of racial separatism.<br />You also learn a great deal about the mindset and courage of those who were free to leave South Africa during those dark days yet chose to stay and fight a well-armed and oppressive foe. And as modern-day South Africa has inherited the legacy of apartheid, the book is as fully relevant today as it was when it was written.<br />Gordimer packs a lot into this novel; it's not a page turner, but a book that you soak up slowly and deliberately. It is a solid, important book, worthy of a world-class writer and Nobel Prize winner.	2002-08-11

The tradition of Illumination Night and the summer gatherings of Methodist families on the island make a kind of magical, firefly-lit ambiance for this tale of people, young and old, whose lives intersect in unexpected ways.<br />The most fascinating character for me was the agoraphobic young wife, trapped in her house by fears she can barely articulate. Hoffman's treatment of this characters is so realistic and convincing that after reading the novel I felt for the first time that I not only understood this condition; I had lived it.<br />While the gentle-giant young man is a bit of a surprise for someone reading Hoffman for the first time, she also makes this character perfectly plausible and sympathetic. You can accept the young girl's falling in love with him because we come to care about him ourselves, while realizing that she has the power to break his heart.<br />As a writer, Hoffman leaves you with the impression that she feels deeply for her characters, regardless of their weaknesses and shortcomings. And putting down this novel, you can feel in yourself a tender-heartedness for others that most books either don't try to evoke, or try and fail.	2002-08-11

Written in the 1970's by a writer for The New Yorker, it's very much a product of its time and reminds me in many ways of the downbeat mood of &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; which dates from the same period.<br />A work of nonfiction by a nonwesterner (Kramer lived and worked in Europe), the book does its best to deromanticize and demythologize the American cowboy and the business of ranching. She has picked as her subject a middle-aged cowboy, Henry Blanton, who has lived and worked most of his life on ranches in the Texas Panhandle.<br />The grandson of Texas cowboys, Henry has always yearned for his own cattle ranch, but turning 40 he is still working for other men. His current employer is a well-to-do ranch owner who, according to Henry, wouldn't get out of his car if there was a cow within 100 feet. Fiercely proud, Henry is disappointed with his life and at times feels ashamed of his failed dreams. He drinks too much and with his brother Tom gets too easily into fist fights that end with broken windows, taking exception to police officers, and spending the night in jail.<br />A skilled ranch worker, with a vast knowledge of raising cattle, Henry's role models are the men in Hollywood westerns. He emulates their strength of character and stoic self assurance. Yet Kramer finds little to admire in him, revealing his scarcely disguised racial prejudices, his chauvinism, his hatred of &quot;hippies&quot; and &quot;Easterners,&quot; his rigid conservatism, his self-pity, his rage, and his envy of men who have grown rich through luck, cleverness, or anything but perseverance and hard, back-breaking physical labor.<br />His wife Betsy, former high school cheerleader and homecoming queen, has raised four daughters in the vast, sweeping isolation of the Texas plains. Only their youngest still lives at home, an adept horsewoman and born-again Christian, who is also much attracted to boys. If Kramer shows any respect for these people, it is a pained sympathy for Betsy, who despite growing signs of depression tries to remain emotionally tough and stand by her man.<br />Where the men and women of the West have no doubt been idealized in popular imagination, this book tries single-handedly to correct the balance. As such, it's a tough read and may seem less than even-handed. If you approach it as a story about individuals who could be living anywhere, it's a grim but compelling account of hard lives and disappointed hopes.ho is also much attracted to boys.

California	There's a great deal to enjoy and think about in this richly detailed novel of a young man's emergence into manhood, discovering himself as a father-to-be, and wanting more than anything to become a responsible parent and family man like his own father. These are working class people, living in what I take to be Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, scraping lives together and not giving up on each other.<br />Darnell, the hero, rides close to the edge of failure as his fortunes rise and fall and rise again, first as a temporary firefighter battling brush fires in the mountains and later running a small gardening business keeping yards in a middle class housing development. Straight paces her narrative slowly and builds plenty of tension as we watch Darnell come into his own, often through trial and error, with so many of the odds stacked against him.<br />Straight is a fine Southern California writer, and her book was for me a very readable and engaging introduction to a world that is seldom written about so warmly and eloquently.	2002-08-10

Although there is a whole range of deeply felt emotions in the book, it is often the heartbreak of everyday life that permeates the work. Meawhile, there is a near-Proustian depth of detail in the account of lives lived in small midwestern towns, first in North Dakota and then Illinois.<br />Woiwode also captures the dynamics of family life, particularly in the close relationship between the narrator and his slightly older brother (a relationship celebrated, explored, and lamented in a sequel novel, &quot;Born Brothers&quot;). It's been years since I read &quot;Beyond the Bedroom Wall,&quot; but there are moments in it almost seared into memory like film images. That is partly due to Woiwode's poetic gift for language that makes you want to read and savor every word on every page.<br />In later years, Woiwode returned to North Dakota and has lived there in a rural community in a kind of self-imposed spiritual exile. The early writings, in my opinion, are far superior to his later work. When he wrote &quot;Beyond the Bedroom Wall,&quot; he was at the peak of his powers as a storyteller. Yes, it's a &quot;great&quot; American novel.	2002-08-10

This classic compendium of cowboy terminology first published in 1936 by Ramon Adams is surely one of them. In the chapter on cowboy nicknames, there is told the story of Dishwater Martin, who like Dish Boggett in the novel, got his name by mistaking dishwater for drinking water.<br />And if you've read \\"Lonesome Dove\\" much of the early material in this book will be a little familiar. Adams discusses at length the duties of cowboys on the job in open rangeland, on cattle drives, and on ranches. Their manners, habits, attitudes, and codes of behavior are discussed, especially the close bond between cowboys and their horses. And interwoven through all of this are the words, terms, and phrases borrowed and invented by cowboys, observed and noted by Adams over many years as an amateur lexicographer.<br />I found the reading got more interesting as Adams explored topics that spilled over into storytelling and something I guess we'd call socio-linguistics today. The chapter on cooks, cooking, food, meal-time etiquette, the chuckwagon itself, and the sharp wit of cooks is especially enjoyable. Adams also makes good reading out of his chapters on cattle rustling, guns, the afore-mentioned nicknames, and (much too briefly) cowboy dances, also known as 'hoe-digs,' 'shin-digs,' 'hoe-downs,' and 'stomps.' I learned square dancing as a boy but never heard calls as arcanely mystifying as the ones Adams records here.<br />While Adams observes that cowboys were also notoriously profane and wildly inventive in their profanity, the mores of 1936 prevent him from giving any examples. Sad to say, that's the only chapter I have to report as missing from this otherwise entertaining and informative book.<br />\\"Cowboy Lingo\\" is one of those rare reference books you can read for pleasure. It opens a wide and richly detailed window into a uniquely Western world.	2002-08-06

Although I have ridden a horse and get out to the occasional rodeo, it's mostly my interest in Western literature that got me to read &quot;Some Horses.&quot; And it turned out to be an entertaining journey into the complex relationship that can exist between human and equine intelligence.<br />One essay is about rodeo calf-roping and another about mountain trail riding and camping in snow, but most of the essays are about McGuane's experience with cutting horses. Developed as a specialized skill of horse and rider on open rangeland, cutting is the exacting art (and now sport) of separating out a single cow or calf from a herd of cattle. Given the strong herd instinct of cows, this is no mean feat, and it takes a fine horse, superior training, and a competent rider to do it well and consistently. In these essays, each devoted to individual horses, McGuane invites the reader into this world of nonverbal communication between horse, rider, and cow.<br />In the hands of another writer, this subject could easily be arcane, technical, vague, or dry as corral dust. But McGuane makes literature of it. The opening essay owes its rambling form and spirit to Montaigne, and all of them are rich with sharply observed details, nuances of emotion, and fascinating character sketches of both people and horses. The only thing dry is McGuane's wry sense of humor. In the essay about a winter road trip with his wife and four horses from Southern California to Montana, I was laughing out loud.<br />You don't have to be a horse lover for this one. All that's required is a curiosity about animal psychology and the place where it comes in contact with the psychology of humans.	2002-08-03

Ehrlich, born and raised in California, retains her outsider's eye for detail, and is able to translate the perspective of someone trained in documentary filmmaking very effectively into the medium of words.<br /><br />Her portrayal of the men who work in this environment is very different from the stereotypes we know from Marlboro ads, \\"Bonanza,\\" and movie westerns. She finds cowboys often tender-hearted, quirky, and curiously courtly. Not to be outdone by the men in this world of extremes and hard work, the women she meets and befriends are tough-minded and independent. Completing her picture are the Native Americans, whom she portrays respectfully and with an ironic appreciation for incongruity, as they both recover and reinvent a lost heritage.<br />Hers is also a personal story. Beginning with the wrenching death of a close male friend, it recounts in her growing love for Wyoming and its people the discovery of a new life. And while her book is no heart-on-the-sleeve display of pain and recovery, one senses at almost every step the healing process that underlies the words. As slender as a book of poems, this volume of essays calls out to be read slowly and savored, word for word.	2002-08-02

It has distanced him from his Mexican-born parents and separated him almost entirely from his Mexican roots. The central idea running through many of these thoughtful, earnest essays is a heightened awareness of the differences between our public and private lives. They also focus on the impact of education on himself and his siblings as children of Spanish-speaking immigrants.<br />After reading his books, nothing about becoming American seems as simple as it's often represented in popular fiction and movies. You see, for example, how learning English and the way Americans use it immediately create cultural conflicts. Rodriguez' parents had valued education as a way to get ahead in America. Ironically, the greater success he experienced in school, the further he became removed from the world of his parents.<br />Still a boy, he lost the ability to converse in Spanish. Becoming a public figure in the English-speaking world, he seemed to betray his ethnic background, which valued privacy and separateness from the English-speaking (gringo) world. Ironically, for all his achievements as an &quot;American,&quot; Rodriguez learns that because of his background, he remains in many ways an outsider. Lacking a middle class upbringing, he has passed through the educational system as a &quot;scholarship boy.&quot; This term, borrowed from Richard Hoggart's book &quot;The Uses of Literacy,&quot; describes the son of working class parents who is granted the privilege of a middle class education, but while rising above his humble origins, never fully transcends them.<br />The political positions Rodreguez takes as an adult flow as a logical extension from the experiences that shaped him -- especially the benefits of the education he received in a private school. Later there were the benefits that came to him as a &quot;minority student&quot; -- advantages he considered unwarranted. Concerned by poverty in America and the underfunding of schools that would help end poverty, he takes positions that have been unpopular among many educators. In these essays, he challenges the assumptions underlying both affirmative action and bilingual education.<br />Rodriguez writes with great clarity, and his sentences seem crafted with considerable care. He wants very much to say precisely what he means. And this cannot have been always easy, as many of his ideas grapple with both irony and paradox. Often you read paragraphs that seem to have been thought through deeply, then carefully written and rewritten. The care that he takes in writing these essays reflects a wish to be read carefully.

In these essays, he challenges the assumptions underlying both affirmative action and bilingual education. <br />Rodriguez writes with great clarity, and his sentences seem crafted with considerable care. He wants very much to say precisely what he means. And this cannot have been always easy, as many of his ideas grapple with both irony and paradox. Often you read paragraphs that seem to have been thought through deeply, then carefully written and rewritten. The care that he takes in writing these essays reflects a wish to be read carefully.

An isolated Nebraska childhood in the early decades of the 20th century, and an even more isolating experience riding the rails as a drifter during the Great Depression -- these are not auspicious beginnings for a respected writer or a scholar. His family was poor, and his deaf, deranged mother haunted his life. From early on, he was a loner, with a poet's sensibility, who learned to welcome the gifts of solitude and nature.<br />On fossil digs on the High Plains during his university summers, he developed a fascination for the evolution of life on planet Earth. He was at ease fathoming the great sweep of millennia in which this present era is hardly more than a brief moment. While very much a scientist of the mid-20th century, he regarded the Ice Age as a recent event. And this perspective colors his thoughts with a sense of wonder that modern day readers are not accustomed to finding in books on any topic.<br />Eiseley wrote as a scientist, but his vision was always personal, even when he was writing about vast subjects. As a writer, he had a remarkable ability to make his subject matter exciting and accessible to nonscientists. Though he was celebrated as a great nature writer, one of the best since Thoreau, his true subject is Time. In \\"All the Strange Hours\\" he looks back over his life of 75 years.<br />Not quite an autobiography, it is a collection of episodes that were key points in his life. Some are humorous, some poignant, some grimly sad, some angry. There are accounts of recovering his health in the Mojave of California, a trip to Tijuana, where his entire energy is spent keeping a drunken companion out of trouble, a \\"perfect day\\" drinking grape pop under a railway water tank with three other drifters.<br />He writes of academic politics, student unrest in the 60s, losing his hearing, stray dogs, wasps, dancing cranes, a cat that bows and another one that talks, ancient burial chambers, a jail break in a blizzard, and the impact of homo sapiens' discovery of fire. And there are fascinating accounts of dreams. As a writer, Eiseley has a wide ranging knowledge of many subjects, and the connections he makes between them are unpredictable and sometimes breath-taking.and another one that talks, ancient burial chambers, a jail break in a blizzard, and the impact of homo sapiens' discovery of fire.

Suspected of participating in a plot against Hitler, he was eventually executed in the closing days of World War II. This book is a collection of letters he wrote from prison to his family, his fiancee Maria, and his dearest friend Eberhard.<br />Bonhoeffer was in his late 30s when he was arrested. He was a Lutheran theologian, who had publicly questioned the rise of fascism and anti-Semitism in Germany and was systematically silenced by Hitler's government, unable finally to publish any of his writings or to preach in any pulpit. Along with other members of his family, Bonhoeffer secretly participated in an effort led by officers of Army Intelligence to undermine the war effort. Attempting to build a case against him, the Gestapo kept him a prisoner, awaiting trial. Incriminating evidence did not emerge until after the July 1944 attempt on Hitler's life. And at this point the letters stop, as Bonhoeffer was transported to another prison and eventually to a series of concentration camps.<br />The letters in this volume describe in detail the routines of prison life. And they offer a glimpse of life lived by ordinary civilians during months of aerial bombardments, as the fabric of daily life slowly crumbles. They also reveal the thoughts and emotions of a man whose faith in God and trust in survival are put to the severest test. While he is remembered by those who knew him in his last months as a fiercely brave, courageous, and selfless man, we see in the letters his inner turmoil, his fear, loneliness, and sense of isolation in a world his theology never imagined.<br />Included in the collection are polite and cheerful love letters to the young Maria von Wedemeyer, to whom he has proposed marriage. And more deeply moving still are his heart-felt letters to Eberhard Bethge, a fellow clergyman and dearly loved friend. It was Bethge, many years later, who collected these letters and published them; he has also written an extensive biography of Bonhoeffer. (The letters to Maria von Wedemeyer have been published separately as \\"Love Letters from Cell 92\\"). A collection of Bethge's essays on Dietrich Bonhoeffer was publisehd in 1995 under the title \\"Friendship and Resistance.\\" They portray Bonhoeffer's friendship with Bethge and describe how the prison letters between them survived.<br />Bonhoeffer's life should have been that of a theologian much respected in his own time who, in a large body of work, advanced an understanding of God for a modern, secular world. His years cut short, we can only guess what his final contribution would have been. But the letters are an inspiring testament to a life lived without compromise or despair, in the face of overwhelmingly destructive forces.blished them; he has also written an extensive biography of Bonhoeffer.

We meet him on a hot, hazy day doing a roofing job on a church in Los Angeles. Quiet, focused, he watches warily the heedless young man working with him and then catches him just in the last moment as he falls from the roof. This same drama plays out again later in the novel, as Rand saves the lives of other mountain climbers, high in the French Alps, in wintry, bone chilling conditions.<br />One case of heroics makes him a media celebrity, and for a time he is an American in Paris enjoying his 15 minutes of fame. But the time passes, and he returns again to the austere, stoic life of a climber, growing older, with no assets, no home, no one who will love him on his own terms. He has only his desire to continue climbing and the need to take ever greater risks. Emptied of every other need, his lonely heroism is an ironic portrayal of the individual who strives against all odds to achieve impossible goals.<br />Salter's writing style is crystal clear, always vivid. He tries for no special effects, just a precise choice of words, sentence after sentence, and an unblinking eye for detail. If you have the slightest trepidation about heights, the descriptions of the climbs make your heart race. Master of his matter-of-fact style, Salter moves beyond emotion and the romance of adventure to capture the excitement of being fully in the present moment and intensely alive.	2002-07-31

Few baseball fans here could tell you that long before the Dodgers left Brooklyn, Ch&aacute;vez Ravine was the home of three communities of Mexican-American laborers and their families.<br />Don Normark, a young photographer in 1948, was climbing in the hills looking for postcard-shot views of LA when he discovered La Loma, Palo Verde, and Bishop. Each neighborhood was a rambling cluster of buildings, dirt streets, and footpaths. The wooded slopes of Elysian Park overlooked the ravine, and beyond were the peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains. He felt he had found another world -- a kind of Shangri-La. For many months, he returned to take pictures of what he saw and of the people he met there. He didn't know that he was recording on film the daily life of a place and its people that was about to disappear.<br />The pictures, of course, are black and white, a rich range of gray tones and contrasts under the cloudless southern California sky. In a casual street scene, two men stand talking on the hard dirt, and a third, his back to them, leans across a low concrete wall. All is in sharp focus from the dusty tire track in the foreground to the pointed tower of City Hall nudging up over a darkly wooded ridge in the distance. The mid-afternoon light reflects brightly off one man's tee shirt and from the front of a small white house farther on. Meanwhile, the shadows cast by eaves, palm fronds, parked cars, and the men themselves are deeply dark.<br />There are many pictures of people, of all ages. Some look into the camera. Most are busy working, walking, talking, playing. A young girl wears her confirmation dress. A boy watches his father repair a car. Two men spar under branches thick with bougainvillea blossoms. An iceman stands in an open gateway, tongs slung over one shoulder. A young woman arranges flowers on an altar. A workman returns home along a winding footpath at the end of the day (see book jacket above).<br />Fifty years later, Normark gathered together his pictures and began looking for the people who had once lived in Ch&aacute;vez Ravine. This book is an album of those pictures, with commentary by the people he found, in their own words. Normark writes simply and clearly about himself and his experiences. Like his photographs, his writing style is sharply focused. In the opening pages of the book, he describes the forced relocation of the people of Ch&aacute;vez Ravine during the Fifties, and the various public and private interests contending for control of its development. Normark's book is both handsome and beautifully written, a fine example of text and image illuminating each other.home along a winding footpath at the end of the day (see book jacket above). <br />Fifty years later, Normark gathered together his pictures and began looking for the people who had once lived in Chávez Ravine.

Traveling with Mexican farm workers, writer Ted Conover crossed twice into the US. He worked with them, picking oranges in Arizona, and drove with them to farm jobs and harvests in Idaho and Florida.<br />Conover writes with a clear eye and doesn't disguise his feelings for his subject matter. He is able to create and sustain suspense over many pages, including a days-long journey through a blizzard in a broken-down car, crossing miles of Arizona desert on foot by night, being pulled over by police in Utah and jailed under suspicion of transporting illegals -- a felony. In an episode both foolhardy and hilarious, he helps four of them get from Phoenix to Los Angeles by escorting them on their first-ever airplane flight.<br />\\"Coyotes\\" is a book about friendship and winning trust, and Conover shares his pleasure in becoming a trusted friend of the men he comes to know. He even makes a pilgrimage to the Mexican village his friends come from, where we meet their families and relatives.<br />After reading this book, it's difficult to maintain one's stereotypes of alien workers and illegals. And when you read the headlines and see TV coverage devoted to stories about border control, you feel you have a better idea of what it's like to be walking in their shoes.	2002-07-31

In his travels, he discovered two itinerant worlds, sometimes overlapping, that are often misunderstood, and invisible to most Americans. In many ways naïve and sometimes too trusting, Conover also discovered the limits of his middle class upbringing. His first two books, \\"Rolling Nowhere\\" and \\"Coyotes\\" were based on his experiences. Together they represent a kind of coming of age in America.<br />With little knowledge of real hobo life, Conover left college in the East, jumped a train in St. Louis and headed west. In the months that followed, he crossed and recrossed 14 states, meeting and traveling with a dozen or more modern-day hoboes. He learned from them how to survive, living off of handouts, sleeping rough, avoiding the railroad police. And he learned about loneliness and loss of identity.<br />There are moments of pure pleasure, a tin cup of steaming coffee on a cold high plains morning, the unbroken landscape gliding by open boxcar doors. And there are times when the romance of adventure disappears completely -- in bad weather and bad company. I greatly enjoyed this book and was often touched by Conover's youthful pursuit of independence and experience, often taking risks and crashing head-on into realities he does not anticipate. At the end, the romance of the rails has been pretty much stripped away; he's not sorry, but he's had enough.<br />His book \\"Coyotes\\" is a great companion to this one, as it shows him a little older and somewhat wiser, on yet another risk-taking adventure that throws him into yet another marginal world.	2002-07-31

They mostly wouldn't know that years later, after an education at the University of Texas, he was a Rhodes Scholar in Oxford, a controversial newspaper editor in Texas, and the youngest editor of America's oldest continuously published magazine, Harper's.<br />Throughout his adult life he was a writer. His memoir \\"North Toward Home\\" is a recollection of a boyhood in pre-integration Mississippi, the rough and tumble of state politics which he covered for the Texas Observer, and coming to terms as a Southerner with New York City, which he liked to call \\"the Cave.\\"<br />As a writer, Morris saw both the humor and sadness in the circumstances of daily life. He was fascinated by people and politics, and deeply committed to social justice. Growing up in the rural South, he also had a strong sense of how people are shaped by their history, traditions, and the terrain of the land they call home.<br />His many books include an account of school integration in his hometown in 1970, a tribute to his friend James Jones, author of \\"From Here to Eternity,\\" and an account of the making of \\"Ghosts of Mississippi,\\" Rob Reiner's film based on the murder trial and conviction of the man who shot Medgar Evers. One of the best introductions to Morris' style and favorite subjects is a collection of essays and exerpts from longer works, \\"Terrains of the Heart and Other Essays on Home,\\" which was published in his later years and is currently in print.<br />A great companion volume for \\"North Towards Home\\" is \\"From the Mississippi Delta: A Memoir,\\" by African-American writer Endesha Ida Mae Holland. Her book is a compelling account of growing up poor and black in small-town Mississippi and coming of age during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s. Together, these two books provide a fascinating look at both sides of the racial divide in the Deep South of the mid-20th century.th sides of the racial divide in the Deep South of the mid-20th century.	2002-07-31

Rather than a day-by-day log of a single journey, it is an account of many trips, as its author criss-crosses the terrain, jumping from place to place and from one historical period to another. When you are done, you have a sense of a vast land and a great 200-year swath of history.<br />Fragments of times and places that we may know from movies and text books come together in a sweeping tapestry containing: Indian tribes, buffalo herds, cattle drives, railroads, homesteaders, droughts, blizzards, grasshoppers, long rivers, sand hills, badlands, small pox epidemics, black settlers, missile silos, strip mining, the Dust Bowl, the Ogalala aquifer, Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, Custer, Bonnie and Clyde, and the experience of driving a van along straight, empty highways in all weather, picking up hitchhikers, sleeping overnight by the road, and stopping to talk to ordinary people living extraordinary lives in a depopulated landscape most travelers know only as \\"flyover,\\" that featureless land seen from above between East and West Coasts.<br />Its a great enjoyable read that meanders over its subject, sometimes with a sense of wonder, sadness, amusement, and even -- at a fashion show in Nicodemus, Kansas -- unadulterated joy!	2002-07-31

He wrote short stories and essays, in a steady, straightforward style that often seems to be with the voice of the heart itself. This collection of essays, written between the years 1977 and 1990, tells of his boyhood in Louisiana, his years as a marine, and his life as a student, writer, teacher, husband and father.<br />He is a mixture of a very proud man who is also humbled by what reflection reveals to him of life's meaning. A practicing Catholic, his writing exhibits a strong moral sense. He reaches consistently for a single, coherent perspective from which to see and understand everything. In an age of hype and self-promotion, his sense of himself as a writer seems very old-fashioned. He wonders, for instance, how the quality of writing is affected when you do it for money. Or, as in The New Yorker, your words appear next to advertisements for luxury products.<br />A celebrator of friendship, he speaks lovingly of the men who are his friends. And he shows a strongly democratic spirit in the respectful attention he pays to the conversations of laborers and Amtrak crew members. He speaks less freely about his love for the women in his life, as if to say much would betray intimacies. The title of the book refers to an accident in 1986, when helping a stranded motorist on a dark highway in Massachusetts, Dubus was struck by another car. Losing one leg and the use of the other, he never walked again.<br />His essays on running, playing baseball as a boy, intervening in an assault of a teenage girl by her boyfriend, a cross-country train trip, yield to descriptions of physical therapy and learning to live in a wheelchair. You read page after page of this account, and you look at your own legs, maybe crossed as you sit or stretched out in front of you, suddenly glad for them and aware that you may never take them for granted again. With luck, you won't take yourself for granted again either. Dubus has that effect on you.

The book includes a large selection of full-page monochrome photographs of working cowboys, dating back to the 1880s.<br />Readers can trace the emergence of the cowboy as mythic figure, from his origins as a wild, unsavory character often regarded as a public menace in the frontier towns for his hard drinking and shoot-em-up antics. Readers will learn a great deal about the hard work and dangers of cowboying. And you get a sense of how cowboys on the range (most of them very young) were an elite fraternity of workmen, with specialized skills and a code of behavior that stoically honored bravery, while spending lavishly on saddles and the latest fashions in trail-wear. You also get a sense of how brief this period of history actually was, as the frontier swiftly moved westward and open rangeland was fenced in.<br />My favorite selections in the book are accounts by the cowboys themselves, describing the day-to-day routines and the occasional adventures of life on the trail. Among these is an excerpt from cowboy author, Andy Adams, whose \\"Log of a Cowboy\\" is a classic of Western literature. The editor of the collection, William W. Savage, Jr., who holds a PhD from the University of Oklahoma, has written an informative introduction based on what seems to be considerable familiarity with the subject of the American West.	2002-07-30

Meyers' stories represent the narrative tradition found in &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; and &quot;The Spoon River Anthology.&quot; He has a gift for capturing the way rural Midwesterners speak, and each of the stories is a dramatic monologue in a distinctly different voice. He also has a remarkable ability to evoke in words the experience of physical sensations -- qualities of air and movement, nuances of deeply felt emotion and memory.<br />There are frequent references to the topography of the land and the traces left behind of geological ages past. This awareness of prehistory and the cycles of seasons, migratory birds, and extremes of weather, frame the lives of characters who live and work in rural communities and on family farms. A young man is struck by lightning while operating a combine. A crew boss at a corn processing plant must deflect the mounting rage of an itinerant employee. A young woman struggles with her father to hang onto a farm he no longer wants. A young farmer restores a section of his cornfields to wetlands, so geese will stop again on their seasonal flights. Two bored teenagers invent a death-defying game played out nightly on country roads.<br />Although often haunted by isolation, loss, and regret, these are richly experienced lives, lived by people reminded daily of their vulnerability by the vast, open land around them and their dependence on one another.	2001-03-30
