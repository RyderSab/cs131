Her life is peaceful, quiet, and she's seemingly content, until she reads a letter from her recently-deceased mother which changes everything.  Ave's life is turned upside-down and she rethinks her personal and family history, what she needs and wants to be happy in life, and her place in the world.  <br />A very nice and pleasing book, I plan to read the sequel.  However, my one main complaint was that the characterisation here wasn't actually that impressive, compared to other aspects of the book.  The men in this novel aren't discernible from one another at all.  The women are written much better, but even some of them seemed more like cut-outs rather than fully-fleshed characters.  That being said, Ave Maria, the main character, was written well, and I liked her and want to know her better (although, is this good or bad I wonder?)  The plot was, in general, logical and neat.  One full extra rating point because for some reason I can't place, I stayed up until 4am reading this book!  Must be something!	2004-03-02
US	53041467	R2CNRJRKJNXNGG	0553579983	153158875	And Then You Die	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Mediocre suspense novel	Bess Grady is on a routine assignment in small-town Mexico as a photojournalist, but the howling of dogs triggers a terrible memory she's worked so hard to supress, and she knows she's stumbled onto something sinister that she must fight.  Along the way she encounters the dark and mysterious Kaldak, a man she's not sure is out to kill her or help her bring down the cause of the evil that has brought destruction to the town and threatens the world.<br />Frankly, this was not an incredibly impressive suspense novel.  Nothing was awful, but nothing was great, and the slightly-below average rating comes from the total implausibility of the plot.  There are much better suspense novelists out there, who write gripping stories with complex characters and good writing.  Nevertheless, this one entertained me enough while I was reading, and I've since picked up two more books by this author to try, so go figure.	2004-03-02

Cryptically refusing to call the murderer anything other than &quot;Death from the woods,&quot; little Virginie draws Elise into a web of terror and frustration as this serial killer gets ready to strike again.  The unique thing about this story is that our protagonist Elise is mute, blind, and quadriplegic, so she doesn't know how to convey this information to anyone else, and is left to suffer with her knowledge in silence as events progress around her at an alarming speed.  <br />A lot of the events in this book are a little unrealistic and will require a good dose of suspension of disbelief.  In addition, you'll need the ability to look beyond some somewhat one-dimensional supporting characters.  If you don't possess either of these two things, you might not enjoy this book.  Otherwise, however, Aubert does a great job of creating an interesting character in Elise, and letting us live this story through her experiences.  You can feel the frustration and tension that Elise herself must feel, being unable to communicate what she knows.  This whole story had a very &quot;classic&quot; mystery feel to it, along the lines of Christie (except better), as we weave in and out of the story, never knowing who's guilty or innocent from one moment to the next.  I would read another by this author.	2004-03-02

Sports rep Myron Bolitar is ready to watch his big client, football player Christian Steele, sign the biggest-ever contract for a rookie and shoot both of them into the big-times.  But then Christian is contacted by a former girlfriend that everyone thinks is dead, and Myron goes on the hunt to find the truth about what happened to her.<br />I love Coben's humour, and when I can put aside questions about how unrealistic some of the stuff in the book is (31 years old and his resume reads pro ball player, high-ranking FBI specialty agent, practising attorney, tae kwan do black belt and sports agent who still lives with his parents), I really enjoy myself!  Myron and his sidekick Win are a barrel of laughs.  <br />My only complaint about this book was the ending - a bit too &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; for my taste (having read the second in the series, &quot;Drop Shot,&quot; I can say that it's got a better ending).  I'm also tired of every woman in a book being the most gorgeous being ever created.  Ah well.  At least in this one, the guys are hunky, too.	2004-02-03

Left alone to wonder about the family secrets that seem to be hiding everywhere, they turn to each other for the love and affection they can't find elsewhere.  <br />This is an absolutely haunting book.  The writing was just about as beautiful and powerful as any I've encountered.  Dunmore created such a strong sense of place that was so enveloping that I had to take breaks from reading just to warm up and bring myself back to my life, because I felt like if I spent too much time there in the world of the book, I'd be trapped and never make it out.

He's drawn into this magical carpet world which has awoken, and in doing so, has attracted the attention of the powerful evil forces that seek to destroy it.<br />I was completely captivated by this story, drawn in from page 1 and kept rapt until the last line.  I can't say much about character development, which is usually my #1 interest as a reader, because I was too busy being swept along into this magical world that Barker created.  Not a short book, I wasn't aware of the length because I was so involved in the storyline and rooting every step of the way for the survival of this magical world.	2004-02-03

Kwan, having come to the US from China at age 18, is blissfully enthusiastic about everything, including her new-found baby sister and her interactions with yin people (otherwise known as ghosts), while Olivia is half-Chinese by blood, but fully American in her attitudes, and not fond of Kwan's eccentricities and over-zealous sisterly attentions.  Olivia tells us the story of her one-sided relationship with her sister as well as her own troubled marriage, while Kwan is simultaneously telling a mysterious and absorbing story of her previous life in 19th century Manchu China.  <br />There are enough similarities between this book and \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" by the same author, that it was impossible for me not to compare the two while reading.  However, aside from the handful of similar themes and relationships (an obvious one being that of the westernized younger woman struggling with a suffocating relationship with an older, more traditionally Chinese one), there is a world of difference between them.  This book sparks with wit, energy, and the tightness of great writing, while simultaneously providing a flowing, relaxing, and immensely beautiful story to read.  This is one of those books that you can love but not crave a sequel, because it sits so well on its own.  All the parts of this novel work perfectly together to form a complete whole.	2003-07-27

Twenty-five years later, they lead separate lives - One is a cop whose wife just ran away on him, another has removed himself from a life of crime and runs a neighbourhood shop to support his wife and 3 daughters, and yet another is married with a son, but is mainly just trying his best to keep his secret demon, &quot;the boy,&quot; under wraps.  When tragedy strikes one of the families in the neighbourhood, they are, by chance, drawn together once again, and must confront a past they were all doing their best to forget.<br />This was an absolutely brilliant novel - a work of great writing, amazing characterization, delving into complex issues, and a sense of place and setting that you might find in the most literary of novels.  Here, it just happens to surround a murder mystery.  I read a lot of suspense mysteries, and without a doubt, this is the best book of the genre that I've read.  Highly recommended!	2003-07-22

Judge Reuben Atlee was once a commanding and powerful figure in the legal community of a small Mississippi town.  Now he's terminally ill, living a solitary life, having chased away all those who might have cared for him.  Ray Atlee receives a formal summons to appear at his father's home to discuss his estate along with his younger brother, Forrest, but when he arrives he finds a shock, &quot;known only to Ray.  And perhaps to someone else,&quot; as the back of the book says.<br />Grisham is a good writer, evidenced by the easy, interesting, and believable way he writes his characters.  So I don't know why he has spent so many years devoting himself to these rambling, boring books.  The plot could have been interesting but it just droned on for me and I spent most of this book waiting for something good to happen.  Characterization was good as I mentioned, but at moments the main character seemed to have some inconsistencies for the sake of suspense.  My decision long ago (after reading &quot;The Chamber&quot;) to stop buying his books new and only read them if I found them used was confirmed again by &quot;The Summons.&quot;	2003-07-03

I'm a big Findley fan, but this is not my absolute favourite of his... and Findley himself called it his &quot;slightest book,&quot; although I'm not sure I'd go that far.  It still goes to say that this is a really great book with believable characters and a complicated plot with common but complex themes.  It may even make you question your own character and what events it would take to make you break away from what you think is most important in your life.<br />Note also that anyone who's ever been to Stratford, Ontario, will recognize a lot of landmarks and even people in this story!	2003-06-23

She has a knack for taking the most unusual or unconventional characters and situations and making them seem so realistic and sympathetic.  One thing that always strikes me is that she seems to care about her characters so much.  Despite their flaws, despite their outright freakishness at times, she, because of her affection for them, is able to convey to the reader their fundamental humanity.  As a result, the focus is taken away from whatever makes them different, and we are instead drawn to see the similarities between them and ourselves.<br />Some images from this book will stay with me forever.  Silvie and Sue as well as Simon and Samuel, two sets of siamese twins, each with their own story, for example.  Incomparable characterization, simple but profound writing style, this book is absolutely unforgettable. <br />And, if I can sneak in another recommendation, check out &quot;Mister Sandman&quot; by the same author - as much as I loved this one, that one's even better!	2003-04-24

All is well until one day, R.J. is kidnapped after school.  Was it the Russion mob or some more terrifying captor?  Megan cannot trust anyone but herself to find her son.  <br />The storyline was interesting and suspenseful, and kept me turning pages late into the night - I'm not the fastest reader, but I polished off this book in just over a day.  However, character development was mediocre at best, and I wish I could have cared more about the people in this story.  There were a few moments where I was made aware of the writing process behind the story, and I dislike that.  The plot rates a 3.5 stars, but the characterization and writing style brought it down for me.	2003-04-17

This was my second read by Little (first was &quot;The Walking&quot;) and likely my last.  In &quot;The Town,&quot; Gregory and Julia Tomasov win the lottery and return to the small town of Gregory's childhood along with his mother and their 3 kids.  They forget the traditional/religious invitation to the spirit that will supposedly keep any house safe, but nobody except Gregory's mom takes it seriously.  Not surprisingly, horror ensues, or some strange imitation of horror.<br />This book features weak characterization, a dull dragging plot, a few moments that you know should be really gripping but just aren't, and to top it all off perfectly - lots of typos.  There were some unique horror moments which were fascinating in their weirdness, but they didn't come close to making up for the *horror* of this reading experience.	2003-03-27

A series of paintings called \\"Sleeping Women\\" is being released into the art world - they are by an anonymous artist, and depict nude women who seem to be sleeping, but as the series progresses, and the paintings get more realistic, it looks more as if they are actually dead.  Photojournalist Jordan Glass is browsing though a gallery in Asai when she is confronted with her own face in one of the paintings, or more likely the face of her twin sister, who disappeared over a year ago.  We watch Jordan work with the FBI to hunt down the artist, the killer, and hopefully discover the fate of her missing sister.<br />The plot might have been satisfying enough with compelling characters and an interesting writing style to back it up, but the writing didn't do much for me, and I was distracted throughout much of the book with the glaring fact that this was a male author writing a female first-person narrator.  In my opinion, if you can't successfully write a protagonist of the opposite sex, it's not sufficient to bandaid the problem by continuously mentioning how unconventionally masculine your female character is - just write it with a male lead and let the reader enjoy the juicy storyline.	2002-12-02

This book chronicles the life of Nobel prize winner John Nash.  I found it disturbing in the distinct sense of &quot;gossip&quot; I got from the whole book, as John Nash was only referenced as a direct source once or twice, and although Alicia Nash (John's wife) was referenced more often, I still felt that the couple's privacy and wishes weren't respected enough.  Note, however, that my opinion isn't based on anything except the feeling I got from reading this book.<br />Another downside is that there was a bit too much detail given to certain things, such as the people Nash met throughout his life... a large percentage of this book doesn't have anything to do with John Nash.<br />Given all of that, it was still incredibly fascinating to learn about this intelligent, torn, complex person.	2002-09-18

I was in a bit of a reading slump and this is the only book that could pull me out of it, I finished the majority of it in one weekend.<br />Read about Joan Anglicus, living in 9th century Rome, a time and place where women were nothing more than the property of men, considered unable to think with any amount of intelligence or logic.  Realizing that she will never achieve her dreams as a woman, she leaves a suffocating situation at home, disguises herself as a man and, against all odds, rises in the church to achieve the position of Pope.<br />This novel has adventure, a bit of romance (not too much, thank goodness), and best of all, the ability to sweep you away back to this much different time and place.

This was very distracting for me, and tended to take away my flow of reading.  On the other hand, it was also challenging, in that it made me think about the characters and what their words and actions meant.  <br />The last 20-30 pages are by far the best of the entire novel and well worth the read.	2001-11-23

We read the narrative (written by her looking back as an adult) as she struggles with what her disease does to her life.<br />The writing style is easy to read, although I found myself wishing that the author would have gone a bit deeper into the minds of her characters - I sensed that she had the potential to do so, but didn't for some reason, and I was left unsatisfied.<br />The last 20 or so pages are almost comical.  They really seem as if they were written by someone else, and if not for them my rating and impression of the book would be quite a bit higher.  Instead of being left with the warm fuzzies that the rest of the nice (if too simplistic) story gave me, I closed the last page, thinking &quot;HUH?!&quot;  Overall, I still recommend it as a quick, light read.	2001-11-18

Books	5	18	18	N	N	Really is fun, but great recipes, too	I'm one of those cookbook collectors, who owns dozens of beautiful, pristine, read but unused cookbooks.  But Looneyspoons (along with it's 'sequel' Crazy Plates and of course Joy of Cooking) is the book on my shelf with the most folded, spattered, tattered, scribbled-on pages, because it is truly one of the books I go back to again and again for reliable recipes that are great and reliable.  <BR>The fact that all the recipes are low-fat is just a wonderful bonus that I forget about most of the time.  Look for brownies, stews, wonderful pastas, breads, salads, and a wide selection of meat dishes.	2001-11-06

This is almost the exact same review I wrote for Looneyspoons, but I raved about that one and Crazy Plates is just as good, so I'm not sure what else to say.  <BR>I'm one of those cookbook collectors who owns dozens of beautiful, pristine, unused cookbooks. But Looneyspoons and Crazy Plates (and of course Joy of Cooking) are the books on my shelf with the most folded, spattered, tattered, scribbled-on pages, because they are truly the books I go back to again and again for reliable recipes that are great - tasty, easy to follow, and low-fat.  <BR>But if you're one of those scared off by the low-fat label, don't be!  This isn't carrot sticks and bulger, it's wonderfully flavoured pork tenderloin, trifle, rice pudding, tons of great pasta recipes.  Check out the hamburger/cabbage soup and the quickbread recipes.	2001-11-06
US	53041467	RPANF3OCSU7V	080411918X	832554018	A Patchwork Planet	Books	2	3	9	N	N	Just not a Tyler fan	Barnaby Gaitlin is 30 and is having trouble breaking out of the very tiny and clearly-marked box into which his family (with a bit of help from Barney himself) has placed him - lazy, unmotivated, irresponsible, and an overall unworthy person.  He's half-heartedly waiting for his angel, a tradition in the Gaitlin Family, to swoop into his life and make everything perfect.  <br />He makes a semi-likeable main character, and it's obvious that Tyler feels warmly towards him.  Otherwise, the characterization was a bit lacking, and the book's back-up characters seemed to exist only to be back-ups, rather than full characters in their own right.  The exceptions, and definite high points of this read to me, were the seniors that Barnaby helped out during his job with Rent-A-Back.  Tyler's descriptions succeeded in bringing them alive and making them real, even moreso than Barney, perhaps.<br />This was my second attempt at an Anne Tyler book (first was &quot;Ladder of Years), and I don't think I'll be trying again very soon.	2001-10-27

Berg's writing pins down Sam's feelings... self-doubt, fear, loneliness, etc., with a clarity and accuracy that amazed me.  Sam was real and wonderful, and the cast of characters surrounding her was also fabulous.  I'd definitely recommend this, and not just to those who have been through divorce... also those who wonder about their place in the world, what they're doing with their lives, and what they owe to themselves and others.	2001-10-26

Don't look to this book for warm and fuzzy feelings about how we're all fabulous and life is wonderful.  However, Atwood's ability to expose the most hidden and secret parts of her characters is mind-boggling and that, alone, was enough for me.<br />In this, as in most of Atwood's novels, I don't feel a lot of affection towards the characters - in this case, Elizabeth, Nate and Lesje (3 people in what might be called a romantic triangle by someone as uncreative as myself, although it's like no romantic triangle I've ever read about before) - but I certainly do find them fascinating.  <br />I also find myself feeling oddly sympathetic towards them, despite the self-centred, weak, or otherwise negative traits that Atwood exposes to us as readers.  This can only be because on some level, I recognize at least a few of my own weaknesses, and those of the people I love.<br />I recommend this book to those looking for a character-driven story, and for those who see the value in harsh but honest insights into human nature.	2001-10-23
US	53041467	R1QKBA7JDEUY6Q	0609806505	148189446	Guenevere, Queen of the Summer Country (Guenevere Novels)	Books	1	8	10	N	N	Couldn't Finish	This novel tells the story of Guenevere and Arthur.  I started with high hopes, but those were quickly dashed.  I kept trying, but the going got slower and slower and finally stopped altogether.  <br />The two main characters didn't interest me a lot, and when they did catch my attention they only irritated me.  Several of the side characters seemed like they had potential to be deeper and more satisfying, but the book didn't focus much on them.  The main reason I didn't finish was that the romance aspect of the novel was too much for me.  It distracted me from the storyline (which itself was interesting) and again, made the characters less likeable to me.<br />On the bright side, I did find the story fascinating and this book prompted me to try more books that tell the story of Camelot.	2001-10-03
US	53041467	R3UOQ4GQ8RQL4B	0688170528	990695172	The Pact: A Love Story	Books	4	0	1	N	N	A good read in several ways	This was not what I was expecting!  I hate to say it was a &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; since the storyline can't exactly be considered pleasant, but it was definitely more gripping and plot-based (rather than character-based) than I expected.<br />With a significant but effective flavour of the legal suspense genre playing a part, Picoult tells the story of two very close families in the time leading up to and following the attempted execution of a suicide pact between their teenagers, Chris and Emily.  It really makes you wonder how well you can know a person... even your own child.<br />The plot itself is suspenseful and gripping - I'm not a fast reader, but I finished in a matter of a few days.  The characterization seemed lacking in a couple of characters, but perhaps that only stood out to me because the rest of the time it was almost unsettling in how real and precise the characters were.  The writing style is simple and just right for this novel.<br />I will definitely be picking up more novels by this author.	2001-09-30

Burnard allows us to share in their happiness, anger and grief, as well as all those other parts day-to-day existence.<BR>The simple writing can seem one-dimensional at first glance, but take a slightly closer look and all the layers of the characters, their lives, and the story open up before you in this beautiful tapestry that we call &quot;life.&quot;<BR>I can honestly say that this book had a strong impact on me, to the point where I think it might actually be a life-changer for me. &quot;A Good House&quot; is the newest addition to my list of all-time favourite books.	2001-09-05
