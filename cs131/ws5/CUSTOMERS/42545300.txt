Coming from a Canadian who doesn't always understand the American mentality, I laughed out loud too many times to count! <br />Oddly, enough, it also educated me. Mixed in amongst the jokes and jabs, I learned about American history and government. <br />Jon Stewart is a genius and he has surrounded himself with similar minds - the result is a faulous book. <br />A must read!!	2005-03-01

Clio (daughter of two of Litton's best characters Atreus and Brianna) travels to England with her parents for the coronation of Victoria, the new Queen. From a family of women who have supernatural 'gifts' that come forward during times of peril, Clio has always been simply normal. But she starts to hallucinate about the past while at the estate of William, our hero. Of course they fall in love, but they also work together to find those behind the plot to kill the Queen. <br />The sex scenes were rather gratuitous but overall this was a great book to read. I loved the new characters and it was great to see the new additions to the family trees.	2003-12-28

Seventy years later a young couple purchases it with plans to restore both it and their marriage. The town, however, is not very receptive to their new neighbours and the search for the truth of the house's history begins. <BR>Great characters make the book enjoyable and entertaining.

The stories were usually well-written, very personal and interesting. Which usually makes a great book. However, I was expecting cute little andecdotes of man's best friend. What I got instead was an unending tear-jerker. <BR>One chapter, the one on canine heroism, was heartwarming. The rest, however, had every dog contract a horrible disease, become enfeebled or be involved in a terrible accident. If they weren't killed by a car, they were put down - with their owners holding their paws until the end.<BR>I have a dog and he's my best friend. I've also had to put down another beloved dog after 15 years. So I understand the connection you feel even if others shake their heads and say 'its only a dog'. From that standpoint this book just depressed me. Know what you are getting into before you pick this one up! Make sure you are strong enough!	2003-12-25

Written under the genre of historical romance, this tale could better have been listed as adult. The basic plot of a highland lass, only fifteen years old, finding true love simultaneously with two men is a sheer cover for the unending, gratuitous, raunchy bedroom scenes. <BR>Although descriptions of lush landscapes are well-written, the characters aren't dressed long enough to enjoy them and the only emotions portrayed are lust and jeaslousy. <BR>For a good Scottish romance, look elsewhere - try Jude Devereaux or Julie Garwood!	2003-12-20

The book was fast paced, well written and scary with enough twists to keep anyone guessing. Oh, and it had a little romance as well. A serial killer is enough to send a chill down anyone's spine but with the constant questions of who is it? who do you trust? who is safe? this story is a nail biter.

It was, however, a fun book to read.  Twin girls, both beautiful, hate each other since they were young because one is selfish and cruel but the other is kind and sensitive.  So the kind one dressed like a dowd to avoid notice and her sister's cruel attention.<br />When Amanda, our nice sister, meets Chad who has come to escort them to her aunt's ranch, she falls for him.  But she is so busy plotting to make sure her sister doesn't know her feelings that all sorts of misunderstandings occur.  This adds to the book's light charm.  There is also enough action (train robberies, kidnapping...) to keep the fan of the western genre interested as the girls struggle to fit into their new ranching life.<br />Of course, we have our happy ending but there are also a few twists and turns you wouldn't expect to find in a typical romance - they keep you turning the pages, though.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the book and finished it quickly.  I look forward to the next Lindsey novel!	2003-08-03

Meanwhile, Hayden, her husband, is doing his best to ignore her and his building attraction for his new bride.  He is tortured by his first wife and the life they led before she her mental disorder destroyed their family.  Medeiros paints a picture of a family torn apart by bipolar disorder - undiagnosed and feared in this 19th century setting.  With her usual talent Medeiros shows us the pain and suffering for all those affected by the disease.  When Lottie is able to help Hayden and his daughter deal with the loss of their loved one, they are able to let her into their hearts.  Which is good because Lottie has loved them since the beginning.<BR>Overall, this was an excellent story, well written with great characters.  I now have to go back and read all of Medeiros' books!

I did find this book very helpful for studying because each section was laid out well and very clearly explains the important features of each disease and drug therapy. Unfortunately, it did not cover all the important topics. For example, cholesterol and lipids, GERD, and alcoholic liver disease weren't covered. But the topics that are covered are done very well and it makes a great addition to therapeutics notes.<BR>A caution for Canadians - I would recommend this book but beware of the fact that not all of the listed drugs are available here (nor are all our drugs listed in it) and that the questions in the samples and practice exams are not very representative. They are a great studying tool to see how much information you got from each section, just don't expect your exam to resemble them much.	2003-06-25

So, want to find questions on Peter Pan?  Check out page 57.  How about Walt Disney?

I found it to be of little use for this purpose.  <br />Reading one chapter to learn a concept was not helpful as there was little focus on important details, just a lot of little picky information that really wasn't necessary.  And looking up one particular piece of information was even difficult as vague examples and rambling sentences made reading the entire chapter a must.  <br />As a review tool, the problems at the ends of the chapters were not helpful, either.

Each character tries to find a way out of the situation because James and Bella are now in love.  <br />It sounds interesting doesn't it?  Well, it wasn't.  Ms. Domning tried to reflect the political and religious tensions of the time, but doesn't manage much authenticity.  <br />The book turns out to be a lot of talk about nothing, very little suspense and only a couple of sightings of the ghost.  Not very exciting.  Very slow moving, I can't recommend this book!	2003-05-22

I am a huge fan of everything Barbara Erskine has written and when I saw this book on the shelf, I snatched it up without even reading the description of the book.  So you can imagine my disappointment when I realized that it was actually a collection of 40 short stories.  My philosophy is that if its a good story - the longer the better!  Some of these stories are less than 10 pages!<br />However, I will admit they display Erskine at her best.  Every story is orignal in plot and character and manages to hook you.  She infuses each story with such feeling - romance, fear, confusion - depending on the theme of the tale. <br />If you are a fan of this author, this collection will keep you going until her next novel appears (soon, I hope!).

As Adam gets older and moves on with his life, going away to school and getting married, Brid is confused and consumed with jealousy that she has been abandoned.  Her curse follows Adam's family for two generations until it is broken by Adam's granddaughter.<br />This tale wasn't as creepy as other novels by this auther (House of Echoes or Midnight is a Lonely Place) but it had a very compelling supernatural element. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, its wonderful imagery, characters I grew to love (or, in Brid's case, sympathize with) and the sense of romance in both the location and the relationships.<br />If you're an Erskine fan already you are in for a treat and if not, this is a great book to get hooked...	2003-05-03

The problem with this is that Freddie [prefers men], and although he loves Florence, he could never be in love with her.  Edward is a different story, however.  He spends the whole book lusting after our heroine, of course he getting her in the end.<br />But the characters were so shallow.  Ms. Holly tried to make Edward strong and sensitive but she only seemed to be weak and naive.  And as for Florence, she isn't treated as a person for most of the book.  Edward lies to her, spies on her, uses her and she just takes it.

I'm a Newfie born and bred (officially a 'Townie' as I hail from the capital city St. John's) so I didn't think I really wanted to read this book - I'd lived through it myself - what would I really get out of it? I spent the night of September 11th in the stadium helping to welcome the passengers diverted to my city - I helped to record the identities of the passengers so they could be located later if a loved one was looking for them. I saw people from all over the world, speaking many languages, in many ethnic costumes. I even met one girl who lived near the Twin Towers. And they were all so very happy to be off the planes, accept the food and water and make a phone call home. <br />In an echo of that night in St. John's, DeFede manages to capture the events in Gander and nearby towns from both sides of the event. The 'plane people' were surprised and touched by the generosity of the volunteers and the Newfoundlander's showed a simple acceptance that helping out wasn't an option, it was their duty. As I read this book, I replayed the experiences of that night and the next few days in my mind and it made a little of the anger, hurt, fear and confusion of that time dissipate as I shared moments with a princess, a group of Orthodox Jews and a chief of intelligence. <br />DeFede was true to the people of Newfoundland in our language, custom and attitudes. His writing was informal enough that it felt as if a close friend was telling me a story, but structured enough to be able to keep track of 6,595 passengers and crewmembers throughout six days. <br />Yes, a map would have been useful (I know people that are not from here have a hard time picturing it all) and I wish that it had been a longer book, but all in all, it was extraordinary and I'm only sorry I didn't read it sooner. Those affected by 9/11 (which is to say everyone) should read this book to remember that there is goodness in people and even though we are fantastically different from one another, we can get along.	2003-04-24

And, of course, she refuses to be forced into a marriage she does not want.  So her evil aunt and uncle, who have housed her since her parents died, disown her and Joanna moves to Italy.  She returns years later when her beloved cousin dies and she has to save her nephew from his evil father - our hero, Guy.  <br />The two characters start out as strong, opinionated and somewhat witty.  As soon as they start to fall in love, they lose all character.  All the dialogue is 'I love you always', 'You are my heart', 'I'll always keep you safe in my heart' and similar mush.  I love romance as much as anyone but its nice to have a little real dialogue in there, too.  And they both cried a lot - it was like love had stolen each of their minds.  <br />And the villain of the book (I won't tell you who it is) is just totally unbelievable and comes in and out of the story much too conveniently - I realize its a work of fiction but it isn't science fiction.<br />I'd still recommend Ms. Kinsley's earlier books, but I have to hope everyone will avoid this one!	2003-04-22

I was glad I did.  It wasn't what I'm used to from other books like IT and Carrie but I loved the story.  Our young Trisha gets lost in the woods during a family outing.  During her time wandering in the woods, she is starving and tired and eventually starts to hallucinate but keeps going as she tries to find her way out of the woods.<br />It was a great book with good flow, I was never bored.

But it was so hard to read this!  What happened to the intrigue, the tension, the romance?  For that matter, what happened to the plot?<br />Lincoln meets Melissa at a pond near her home in Scotland.  They know when they meet that they are destined to be together so Lincoln gets permission from her father to start the courting ritual.  But then Melissa's troup of uncles interfere.  They think Lincoln is 'crazy' because of an incident that occurred during their shared childhood.  So the rest of the book is the family talking about how they think he could hurt Melissa if we went over the bend again and her arguing that he would never do that.  Oh, my God, 389 pages of it!  And when I finally read the explanation of what was behind our hero's past, I was so irritated I wanted to scream.  What a stupid ending!<br />I finished it, but barely and hope I never have to read one as bad as this one again!	2003-04-18

I'm sure all of the fans of the show remember the moss wall...<br />There were a couple of people included in the end of the book, however, that I didn't recognize and I wish that there had been more pictures of rooms from the designers.

I actually got half-way through the book the second time before I realized it was in the wrong pile and should be with the already-read books.  <BR>Jillian is accused of murdering her father's friend who has taken her in when she has no family of her own left.  When she is discovered over the bloody body, she panics and runs.  Luckily Adam runs into her and is willing to take her in and help her find the real murderer.  So the usual story ensues- he's bitter over a past betrayal, she falls in love with him but knows marriage is not an option.  Blah, blah, she heals his heart, he falls in love, they find the murderer and finally get married.  Unfortunately, the murder was not a very big part of the book at all.  Sure, Jillian was worried a lot but they did very little to actually solve the murder.  <BR>Overall, it was okay but not excellent.

So Cressida sets out to get the statue by agreeing to be the man's mistress but a highwayman kidnaps her and ends that plan.<BR>The highwayman is actually Tris, our hero, playing at larceny.  From there, nothing happens as the pair try to get the statue back.  <BR>Ms. Beverley tried to make it a very sensual book with the couple dressing up in silk and attending an orgy.  But it just didn't seem to work in this case.  \\"I want...I want to be closer to you, Tris, than I've ever been to anyone since I slid messily from my mother's womb.\\"  To me, things like that kill the mood.<BR>I still enjoy Jo Beverley's books, just not this one in particular.	2003-04-07

And it was kind of depressing to see the romance develop between a couple you know will be prematurely separated.  <BR>It had the same type of soul-mate premise that all the books taking place after this prequel have followed.

But this one was recommended by a friend so I took her word and picked it up.  I had no idea what I was getting into.  The story was pretty good, a young woman is trying to avoid being forced into marriage by making herself a scandal.  To do this, she poses nude for a famous stud of a painter.  We get to see great character depth as our hero struggles with his past and present while our heroine tries to keep her secrets.  The surrounding characters were also great, with just enough evil surrounding the whole plot so the goodness of the characters could shine through.<BR>But what I didn't expect was the sex scenes.  Wow.  Very graphic.  Way past the heaving bosoms and throbbing shafts.  While I don't think this is going to encourage me to move to this type of novel on a regular basis, for a holiday read, it was great.  This is the prototype for the trashy novel and was excellent to read at the beach or tanning at poolside.	2003-01-05

Basically, she asks him to marry her because she believes he's poor and its a great way to get the man she loves to marry her without saying she loves him.  He doesn't really need the money, but agrees and soon realizes he loves her.  They spend the whole book (when they weren't having sex or planning to have sex or thinking about the next time they would have sex or the last time they had sex) thinking about how to get the other to love them without admitting their own feelings.  <BR>Also missing from this story was the Cynster characters.  I was hoping to get more of the characters from the earlier part of the series, but only got very brief snatches here and there.<BR>I was so incredibly irritated.  Ms. Laurens did, however, get pretty imaginative with the sex, though.  She obviously spent most of her time writing developing sex scenes.  <BR>Not worth the read.

The characters were intelligent, wity and the men were sensitive.  What more could a girl want?  <BR>As for the story-it started off well.  Our heroine wants to save her quiet friend from marrying someone her parents want her to so she spreads gossip.  As the notorious Lord X, Felicity can write about anyone she chooses and stay incognito.  Only Ian, our dangerous lord, doesn't like being the subject of a gossip column and tracks her down.  Then the conflict ensues.  He falls for her, but she won't marry him until he can tell her the truth of his past.  That's where it starts to get boring.  We don't hear of his exploits as a spy in the war or any other interesting story.  What we get is an accident.  And the bad guy just disappears, never causes anyone problems.  Sure, he is a vicous, violent man, but he would never harm anyone.  I could have used a little more intruige and conflict.  <BR>All in all, though, it was a good read.

This one, however, was a complete disappointment.<br />It's not that I don't like Chillingworth, in fact, he was a great character when Devil meets his match in an earlier book. But what I loved most about this series is that the surrounding characters add to the story and keep it from being just a romance story, I think it's nice to see humor and intrigue as well. In this book, its only the only familiar face is Chillingworth. No Cynsters (well, Devil is in it for the length of about 6 paragraphs but I don't count that because it was more taling about him, not him talking). Other than the lack of Cynsters, the story was fairly boring. They spend the first half of the book fighting then the second half having sex. The identity of the bad guy in the book who's making attempts on the lives of the new couple is so obvious that its irritating that no one even considers it. <br />Overall I was just disappointed and left wishing I still had my money. I am still looking forward to the next in the series because it involves the twins and I'm assuming her guardians, the Bar Cynster, will have to make appearances.	2001-09-08

Yet he's willing to risk it all to return to his past to help Jillian when her father sends a summons. She loves him but doesn't know his secret, so he tries to push her away and hide his love to keep her safe from his past. <br />Fun and romantic, this was an excellent way to spend a rainy day.	2001-09-08
US	42545300	R25FSOHSF9GC4R	0671737791	378094364	The Bride	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Read it now!	I love Julie Garwood, but this book was great even for her! I fell in love with Alec immediately and Jamie was one of my favorite heroines. Forced to pick a bride from an English family on the King's request, the laird is reluctant. Duty overcomes his reluctance and he travels to chose his wife from the Baron's daughters and get back to his beloved Scotland. He picks the youngest daughter, with her man's name and all. But he soon finds his life is far from complacent, but is instead turning his life upside down. And he, of course, learns to love it. And her. This story was incredibly romantic but still made me laugh out loud as she manages to start war after war with other clans as she tries to fit in with the household. A great story, a great writer. You definately need to pick this one up!	2001-08-26
US	42545300	RZLX4DN187TDD	0380818639	920051939	The Conquest	Books	1	5	15	N	N	Blah.	384 pages of the same dialogue. Yes, she is beneath his station and he plans to marry someone of perfect bloodlines. Okay, can we move on now? Page after page of them telling themselves and friends that they can never be a match. How on earth could they even like each other-how annoying! Someone shoots at Drum at the very beginning of the book and Ally takes him in to care for him. Then for 200 pages, he recuperates from a broken leg over weeks and weeks. It was so silly. No discussion on who tried to kill him, or his supposed career with the War Office. Sigh. And he only had a broken leg, am I supposed to believe that he can't move at all for six weeks even though its splinted? Where was the suspense, the intrigue? The last 35 pages or so hold all the action, if you can actually call it that. The last couple of pages has Drum deciding that he loves her anyway so she has to marry him. And she ignores the fact that he treated her like dirt the whole time and agrees. Gag. The theory in my house is that this situation is one similar to V.C. Andrews. We think the original Edith Layton died and someone else is writing under her name. How else can you explain her phenomenal early books (Surrender to Love, Game of Love, Love in Disguise) compared to the latest, weak attempts at romance novels. Her first books had characters you loved, plots you couldn't wait to unravel and romance that made you sigh. Her latest series only served to make me roll my eyes. Too bad, because I have her early books and I've read them dozens of times and have recommended them to every reader I know. I must make sure to also tell them to avoid her new novels.	2001-08-25
US	42545300	R2FYEKUSUXPO9T	067152819X	335589396	Look Away	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Amazing	Phenomenal.  I got so involved with the characters that it was like being a part of history.  This novel depicts the horrendous rift that separates two brothers and a family as they pick sides in the American Civil War.  <br />It was emotional, gut-wrenching and beautiful all in one.  The second installment was even better, if that can be believed.  <br />This is a must read for all civil war buffs or even everyone who loves a great read.  Pick it up, you won't be sorry!	2001-08-18
US	42545300	R2WZW62X89INHB	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	1	2	8	N	N	Thumbs down	God this was terrible.<br />A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.<br />Despite my dislike of this book, I'll admit it is a very true commentary on society. The powerful abuse those weaker than them; how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient; the set roles of people in society (the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool, good-looking guy).<br />If you are not being forced to read this for school, please don't do it! The Simpsons parody of it is also a good thing to watch. At least in a cartoon it is entertaining, with just as much commentary on society as the original.	2001-08-17

Well-I love my Mom for this pick!  Not only have I discovered a wonderful book but a series and author!  I've read the entire series and my only question now is-why can't she write faster?!	2001-08-17
US	42545300	R2T2NWP8MMKS8X	055357566X	418417772	Betrothed	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Couldn't put it down!	Of Ms. Elliott's three books, this is my absolute favorite-and her others were phenomenal!  <br />Guy is bargaining with Claudia's uncle over a holding his family once owned.  While under the dubious hospitality of her uncle, Guy is drugged and left to be discovered in Claudia's bed.  Thinking she was a part of the conspiracy to get his fortune, Guy kidnaps Claudia during his escape(although she is quite willing and ready to go) and takes her to his home.  Her uncle tells people they are betrothed (hence the title) and he's willing to go along with it for a while.  Claudia, the sister of the Italian assassin we saw try to do Kenric in in the Warlord novel, starts to finally feel at home somewhere.  Then, of course, Guy falls in love with her and has to convince both her and his family of it.  <br />As if the characters in this book weren't great enough, the characters from the Warlord show up in this one to add a touch more depth and humor.  <br />I couldn't read this book fast enough to get the amazing story or slow enough to savor every word of it!  Quite the dilemma!  If you haven't read this (and her other two) yet, why not?  It is well worth the bucks!	2001-08-17
US	42545300	R26096Z2Y80E8P	0671010093	330389236	One White Rose	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Okay	I did love For the Roses so immediately picked this one up when it came out.  It was too short, though to have any character or plot depth.  It only took a little over an hour to read and was left with a feeling of &quot;Okay, so what now?&quot;.  Julie Garwood is a phenomenal author and this just wasn't a very good example of that.  I'd recommend any of her other books though!	2001-08-17
US	42545300	R10UBKRBLOXYM	0553569104	462583878	The Warlord	Books	5	7	7	N	N	EXCELLENT	Okay, Kenric is a little rough around the edges.  I didn't really enjoy the parts where he locked her up in a room.  But then, if he'd sat her down to have a lovely chat about their disagreements, I really wouldn't have believed it.  If you're reading a midieval novel, you have to expect medieval characters.  Other then that, they were both intelligent, witty, stubborn characters who made a great story when they clashed.  <br />With great characters and drama, the tiny lady learns how to tame her warrior husband and he learns to like being tamed.  Typical story but tremendous writing.<br />I've read all of Elliot's books (why, oh why, doesn't she write more?!) and I recommend them all!	2001-08-17

Sure, I don't read a lot of western-set romance, but you never know when you might find a gem in there-Julie Garwood's For the Roses series case in point.  This one was a let down, however.<br />They didn't do anything!  Sure, Caleb and Willow are looking for her brother (or husband, depending on who you ask) so Willow can help him and Caleb can kill him.  Except the pair spent the whole time either making camp, talking about being followed or having sex.  Yawn.  There was no tension, no suspense-oh, yeah, and no plot!  Dull.  But hey, give a girl a chance, right?  I read the second in the series (I'd bought them the same time, so why totally waste my money and toss it?) and it was just as boring.  With the exact same lack of plot.  <br />Sorry, but try another one on the shelf.	2001-08-16

I adore Julie Garwood and this was one of her absolute best.  <br />If anyone knows a writer who writes a scottish romance as well as Garwood-please let me know!!	2001-08-16
