US	50940946	R2FCEDQO7ALV1C	1576121976	269861837	Naked Erotica	Books	5	29	29	N	N	Super Sexy Collection	Here's another winner from editor Alison Tyler! In this collection, she focuses on the sexy state of undress, or nearly undress. From the opening story by M. Christian \\"Jess Undressed\\" in which a man admires his stripped down girlfriend to Ms. Tyler's own piece \\"Naked? Never\\" in which a woman overcomes her fear of taking off everything during sex, the stories are varied and unusual. My favorites include \\"Stroking\\" by Cate Robertson, Savannah Stephens Smith's \\"Naked Ambition,\\" \\"Radiance\\" by Tulsa Brown, and \\"Touch\\" by Rachel Kramer Bussel. But really all the stories -- and there are 26 -- are excellent. The book has a nice heft to it, and the cover is gorgeous. It would make a really nice gift--which is what I thought at first--but then I kept my copy for myself. :)	2004-05-23

I own Sweet Life 1 &amp; 2, as well. The stories were universally hot. My favorites were &quot;You Can't Always Get What YOu Want&quot; by Alison Tyler and &quot;James Dean, One Thousand Bucks, and  a Long Summer Night&quot; by Emilie Paris -- but all of the stories were definitely worth reading. Ms. Blue definitely has a way of weaving the pieces together...one flows right into the next. A definite winner!	2004-05-15

My favorites were Helena Settimana's &quot;Highway 69&quot; about a motorcycle chick and her outdoorsman, Sage Vivant's &quot;The Yacht&quot; about three women on vacation with three hunky sailor boys (with a fantastic on-deck scene! You could practically smell the suntan oil), the almost indescent &quot;Tan Lines&quot; by Thomas S. Roche featuring a delicious outdoor escapade, and &quot;In Dependence Day&quot; by Savannah Stephens Smith featuring a really hot dom/sub relationship. All of the stories sizzle. If you can't go on a vacation right now -- get this book instead!	2004-05-11

The stories each involve food and sex -- two of most people's favorite subjects! A foreword by Michele Zipp, editor-in-chief at Playgirl Magazine, starts the book with a bang. Next up is a piece by Dante Davidson called \\"Farm Fresh\\" about a girl at a road-side fruit stand. There are both hetero and girl-girl pieces in the book. The most unusual story was \\"Dear Alison\\" by Maxim Jakubowski, in which he wrote to the editor about a very personal experience with raspberries. My favorite stories were \\"Doing the Dishes\\" by Rachel Kramer Bussel about a girl with an oddly erotic fetish and \\"Amy's Tattoo\\" by Shanna Germain about a strawberry-shaped piece of skin art. I've never read a book just like this before. I was pleasantly surprised with the whole thing. Also, throughout the book are delightful pieces of spot art. Very unexpected for a sex book, but really quite charming.	2004-05-08

His position puts him directly in charge of her lover.

The stories flow from one to the next seamlessly. My favorites were Marilyn Jaye Lewis' threesome story called &quot;The Birthday Party,&quot; M. Christian's &quot;Services Rendered&quot; about a chance meeting and Alex Mendra's very surreal piece called &quot;Zealous Therapy&quot; that features the most unusual form of puppetry this side of &quot;Being John Malkevich.&quot; There are 27 stories in this one (including a bonus piece from Naughty Stories 4!) and an intro by Jack Hafferkamp of Libido. It seems most genres are covered in the book: voyeurism, spanking, many menages, there is a hot story called &quot;Quality Assurance&quot; about a telemarketer who gets what's coming to him! -- and much more. A truly delightful collection!	2004-01-24

These 30 sexy stories are each written directly to the female reader from different male perspectives. (One of the reviewers of this book did not seem to understand that concept. She says that she couldn't put herself in the narrator's shoes. Well, that's not the point of this book. The stories were written to the reader. She'd be better off reading the companion book, His, which is written from the perspective of 30 different women to a male reader if she wants to read a book written from a woman's view point.) This book is absolutely unique. I haven't read another collection like it. The stories are exciting and erotic and very well written. Fantasies include having sex at a party, sex in a car, sex with an ex, outdoor escapades, sex with a coworker, and many more. The style of the stories is such that you can fall right into them. I bought \\"His,\\" for my husband, and he adores it -- but we've actually shared the stories in both books with each other. A very satisfying collection.	2003-11-24

Story...	...with a little something for everyone.<BR>Set in the world of an L.A. weekly newspaper, this story features a young protagonist who is trying to find her way, both in the world of journalism, and in the world of romance. She thinks she knows what she wants, but the three different men in her life each have their own positive aspects, as does the femme fatale co-worker who seems destined to be her mentor. A seductive read about a charming naif. Not your average X-rated book at all.	2003-09-07

It reads like a mainstream thriller with unexpectedly strong sex scenes. Princess is on a quest to turn around her bad-girl ways and live the straight life... at least for one year, so she can collect her inheritence. Until then, she is penniless and at the mercy of her new man Joaquin Xavier Lee, a classic warrior type. Their love/hate connection sizzles from their very first interraction... One of the best BL books I've read.	2003-08-17

Buy this book for the cover...and then prepared to get blown away by the stories inside. The anthology is just so sexy I can't even say. Cara Bruce's story \\"The Perfect O\\" is mind-blowing. M. Christian's \\"Moving\\" is about the power of the spoken word. Helena Settimana's \\"Six Persimmons\\" may be one of the most beautiful erotic stories I've ever read. But my favorite was \\"Selling Point\\" about a realtor and a prospective house-buyer who discover a secret bondage room in the basement of a house. It's totally hot and I'll read it over and over again. If you like bondage, buy this book. If you like sex buy this book. If you like hot covers, buy this book!	2003-07-27

This is an extremely hot collection of 27 stories, featuring themes like spanking, voyeurism, girls with girls, sex clubs, and more. My favorite pieces were N.T. Morley's \\"Memorandum,\\" a white-hot inner-office memo, \\"California King,\\" by Jesse Nelson, which is a story about the life and time's of a mattress, and Zero Sum Game, by Alex Mendra, with a dom woman and a sub man. In the Empire of Lust by Maxim Jakubowski  is a hot office fantasy and Outing Isolde by Ann Blakely is a dom woman, sub man, sub woman threesome. There is plenty of kink in this book, but even more important, the stories are all very well written!	2003-07-15

It is NOT  a how-to manual for S/M enthusiasts, but a collection of fictional stories along the lines of Naughty Stories from A to Z, Sweet Life, Best American Erotica, etc. If you like hot, sexy writing about people pushing the boundaries, you'll definitely like this book. It originally came out a few years ago under the Masquerade imprint, but is now freshly repackaged by Pretty Things Press. The stories are coded by type of story: hetero, lesbian, solo, orgy... very fun!	2003-05-08

This \\"sweet\\" collection is actually super-sexy, somewhat sinful, and something to savor slowly! I actually liked it even more than Sweet Life, Volume 1, because I felt the stories pushed more boundaries than the first. My favorite piece was \\"A Very Naughty Girl\\" by Sean Evans, and my second favorite was \\"Lucky\\" by Elle McCaul. All of the stories in this book were unbelievably hot and make for repeat reading, or reading to a lover... Thank you, thank you, Violet Blue!!	2003-04-30

The main character is a bi-sexual brunette who knows how to please both men and women. There are many sex scenes, spanking scenes, threesomes, orgies, and more to captivate the attention of any erotic connoseur. The private detective in the story who trails the main character is right out of a Chandler book. Their relationship picks up where the Matlese Falcon left off... Very hot. Very good read.	2003-04-23

There is something for everyone in the stories, from literary erotic masterpieces such as \\"Appraising Love\\" to sex-driven sensory smorgasbords like \\"Your Wish Is My Command.\\" The dialogue in the stories was very well-written, and the entire collection (27 in total: one for each letter of the ABCs plus a bonus story at the end) is far sexier than most of the Best American collections. The cover is deceptive, I think, because it looks so sweet and pink, but inside are really some of the hottest sex stories I've ever read. This will become a classic of the genre, I'm sure!	2003-03-21

This collection of 30 stories is written directly to a male reader and is filled with the sort of fantasies that would delight any guy. From the very start of the book (\\"Every Friday Night\\"), featuring a tantalizing threesome outdoors, all the way to \\"While She Was Dancing\\" (about doing a roommate's boyfriend, the stories are super-sexy, super-hot... just plain super. Even though the stories ARE written to a male \\"you\\", most women would enjoy them, as well. Even better, buy it for a boyfriend/husband/lover and read them out loud to him. The stories are from a girl to a boy, so it would work perfectly. However, I think you'll have to stop often, if you know what I mean. ;)	2003-02-01

It is obvious she puts careful thought into each word she choses. Be aware-this book isn't smut-it's definitely erotic literature! Discerning minds will be very pleased with the purchase. I'm so thrilled to see a full book of only her work! In general, her stories are jewels in whatever collection they are found in.	2003-01-31

This collection of totally erotic short and mid-length stories is aimed directly at the reader. The narrators in the stories write to a nameless \\"you\\" -- which forces the reader (very nicely, I might add) right into each story. It's easy to pretend that the actions in the pieces are happening, unfolding as you read through the book. Lots of different fantasies are covered in this collection, my favorite being \\"The Rules of the Game,\\" which is a story about a girl pretending to be \\"Simone,\\" a high-end call girl. She plays the game much better than her boyfriend does. The fantasies are on par with those found in Forum or Variations -- and they're really very sexy. The book could be read aloud to a lover and would really be a perfect little Valentine's day gift...	2003-01-29

Many of the stories are culled from previously published anthologies, making it a best-of collection. The stories and characters work together perfectly. There are several girl-girl scenarios, so if that's not your scene, this won't be the book for you. That said, the sex is really sexy in all of the stories, and many genres and fetishes are covered, making the book feel very complete and satisfying.	2003-01-23

It's my experience that many erotic collections are on the skimpy side-too few stories to keep the heat up. This book is really filled with a hot assortment of stories that cover a wide range of sexy themes-fantasies, spanking, back-door sex, tickling, girl-girl stories, sex toys, and much more. The book includes some really good writers, too, like M. Christian and Thomas Roche. Buy it. You'll be glad you did!!	2002-09-12

It was unexpectedly bittersweet.	2002-08-28

Her steamy books reside in the top drawer of my bedside table...unless they are in \\"use.\\" This novel, about a young Los Angeles-based journalist, slides from one steamy scene to another. The main character, Jessica, pushes the limits. She explores erotic spanking, outdoor sex, and finds herself in a decadent threesome with a co-worker and male roommate. Other characters in the book are even more wild-- one male actor engages in a s/m relationship with an older, wiser woman who knows how to wield a belt. There is just something for any fetishist in this book...and you'll find yourself fantasizing about scenes long after you set it down. A must have!	2002-03-13

Thomas Roche has gathered some of today's best erotic writers in this collection of fiercely written, highly polished stories for the lover of the noir genre.

I have read all of the Wicked Words anthologies, and this is by far the best. Editor Kerri Sharp really knows what she's doing! My favorite in this saucy collection is a story called &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; by author Kimberly Dean. It's a really kinky story with a very unexpected twist at the end. The other to-die-for story is by Alison Tyler. Called &quot;The Last Deduction,&quot; it's about an IRS auditor who gets what he deserves in the most juicy and extreme woman-on-top scenario. The final story, &quot;Erotica?&quot; by Leah Baroque is just plan hot. Dirty and raunchy for anyone's taste. Buy it. You'll love it!	2001-11-22

The author of the review above appears to be reviewing a different book by Alison Tyler which is called &quot;The Silver Key.&quot; The Blue Rose is Alison Tyler's first Masquerade book. It's awfully good, in my opinion, filled with interesting erotic twists, spanking, seduction, and hot girl-girl sex. Although set in a girls' dormitory, it is actually a modern take on the Victorian theme.	2001-06-01
