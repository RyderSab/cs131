In a not too distant future, Angel is a certified Retribution Specialist (CRS), which means that when the law fails to bring justice, the victims can hire a CRS to bring in the perpetrator of the crime to them to enact their own justice.  When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\"what happened\\" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\"feel\\" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\"hear\\" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\"what just happened\\"?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.  So, if you are looking for something a little different, check out this story!	2005-10-14

When Annie goes into her kitchen to microwave some leftovers, much to her surprise, she finds a naked man...a gorgeous, perfect naked man standing there.  Desperately, she would like to believe he has amnesia, but the people shooting strange ray-guns and trying to kill the both of them prove otherwise.  <br /> <br />As a failed leader of a revolution, James is the sole survivor of planetary genocide.  He has traveled three hundred years into the past to change his own future.  However, James was followed; alone except for Annie he is no more than an escaped convict as well as still a slave.  <br /> <br />Annie is a surprise to James; she is angered about his plight, albeit nervous because he himself told her he has killed someone.  And yet, she still helps him.  But when operatives of the Bureau continually threaten her life, and only his surrender can possibly guarantee her safety, Annie refuses to let him.  <br /> <br />If there is one book you should read this year, it is NEVER LOVE A STRANGER.  I actually read this in an electronic format and I'm SO glad its come out as a paperback...this story is worth the small press price as a paperback.  You won't be disappointed!  <br /> <br />This is an action adventure with a good dose of science fiction that starts out in the present, and takes you to the future, except, which one?  NEVER LOVE A STRANGER has some amazing twists that I hadn't nor could have predicted and literally blew my mind. <br /> <br />As for Annie and James.  WOW.  Ms Fisher has done a phenomenal job writing Annie's reactions to what gets thrown at her.  My heart accelerated, and I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat trying to read faster every time the Bureau started shooting at them.  Then, when Annie travels to the future with James simply because she couldn't let him die (he had been nothing but chivalrous towards her) I couldn't help but cheer her on. <br /> <br />NEVER LOVE A STRANGER is an amazing story full of sexual tension, a widerange of emotions and so many surprises -- I recommend it wholeheartedly!	2005-10-13

Late night talk show host Donna Nolan enjoys her job.  However she would prefer staying in New York rather than having to go to Texas to \\"investigate\\" claims that there are real vampires in the Castle of Dark Dreams.  These claims come from women Donna has dubbed the \\"pod women\\" and broadcasting her own discoveries from the castle is the only way to get them off her show.   <br /> <br />However, Castle of Dark Dreams really is more than it seems.  Between the ghost that appears in her room and Eric the sexy \\"vampire\\", that won't leave her alone Donna has her hands full just trying to conduct an investigation into the paranormal.  When Taurin, a man claiming to be a real vampire steps forward, everything Donna believes regarding the paranormal is put to the test. <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed WICKED NIGHTS.  I feel the plot was much more developed than the previous novel I read by Nina Bangs and I wasn't as frustrated with our hero Eric or heroine Donna, who I felt, were the primary focus of the story.  Even though I feel like they fell in love rather quickly (what do you expect, this is a romance and takes place pretty much over a week) it was accomplished rather nicely.  When Eric used Donnas' secret pirate fantasy to entice her, I really felt the connection and yearning between the two.  I also thought the fantasy was very creative, erotic and well written out.  <br /> <br />I had a good laugh over the introduction of two secondary characters - Sweetie Pie and Jessica; and for once felt that Sparkle really was into making trouble on a cosmic level.  In general, I've never taken her seriously and she has just made me laugh, however this round I was getting frustrated with her.  Trouble really befit her in WICKED NIGHTS and I think as a reader we finally get to see more of who Sparkle really is, especially since she isn't getting what she wants. <br /> <br />Sparkle is a reoccurring character and readers of Nina Bangs won't be disappointed with WICKED NIGHTS.  If youhave never read one of Miss Bangs novels, this is a great one to start with, and reading this story won't spoil other stories. <br /> <br />WICKED NIGHTS continues the paranormal themed stories Nina Bangs writes with her cosmic troublemakers.  With the introduction of three brothers, WICKED NIGHTS has the beginning of a fun and very interesting trilogy...I'm really looking forward to hearing the rest of Brynns story!	2005-10-01

When she is kidnapped in the middle of the night from her ship, it is not her dashing fianc that comes to her rescue...but his cousin Damien, who could ruin her reputation.   <br /> <br />Dark and considered unsuitable as a marriage prospect, Damien Renshaw is perfect to perform a daring rescue.  It is only the time he spends with Adele, his cousins fianc, after saving her that leads him to believe she is more suited for him as a wife than his scientific minded cousin. <br /> <br />I have to admit, I was all set to not like MY OWN PRIVATE HERO.  Adele always came across as perfect.  She always did what she was told and is very agreeable.  Wow!  Did she ever surprise me!  Its not that she doesn't want, or yearn to be adventuresome, its that she has an ingrained, very strong streak of sensibility.  When she was returned to her fianc, she quickly knew he wasn't the man for her.  So she was torn between what she had agreed to do (marry Harold), and reaching out and grabbing what she did want.  I did so enjoy watching Adele grow as she learned that sometimes the things you want the most you have to fight for, and that IS the sensible decision! <br /> <br />Damien is your standard rake and would have thought nothing of taking advantage of Adele, except he is honor bound to return him to his cousin Harold.  It is because of this boundary he sets that he is attracted to Adele as a person rather than just another female.  What could she have seen in Harold that would make her agree to marry a man so obsessed with science that he lived in a laboratory?  So for me, the romance between Damien and Adele is very heart wrenching and tender.  They are perfect for each other and yet fight their attraction for each other because of a man neither wants to hurt. <br /> <br />MY OWN PRIVATE HERO doesn't have your traditional villain; instead we just haveViolet, a scheming sister that wants the money she will get when Harold marries Adele.  Because of this, the story has a different \\"feel\\" to it than your normal/typical novel.  I've read stories lacking a villain were it didn't work; however, for me, and in this case, it did.  There was enough going on with the story as a whole to keep my interest and I really enjoyed some of the secondary characters...I'm really looking forward to Lily's story. <br /> <br />I recommend Julianne MacLean as an author and MY OWN PRIVATE HERO.  Even though this is the conclusion to a trilogy, it can be read alone.  Just know that Adele is the third sister to get married.	2005-10-01

Pamela Gray runs a very successful interior design firm in Colorado.  So when fantasy writer ED Faust asks her to do the decorating for his new vacation house in Las Vegas, she jumps at the opportunity.  Discovering the man wants her to model his house after Caesars' Palace will be a challenge; but trying to figure out how to change his mind on the grotesque animated water fountain of Bacchus is imperative! <br /> <br />Apollo has felt all out of sorts ever since his encounter with the mortal Caroline from the Kingdom of Tulsa.  His twin Artemis, trying to get him out of his funk, takes him through the newly opened portal to the kingdom of Las Vegas.  What should be an enjoyable experience walking amongst mortals turns into a fiasco when Bacchus has several visiting nymphs perform an ancient invocation that actually works!  One of the mortals watching the \\"show\\" accidentally completes the ritual binding Artemis to her. <br /> <br />Much to the chagrin of Artemis, completing Pamelas' hearts desire isn't as easy as she would like.  That, and the interest Apollo has in Pamela is more than just lust... <br /> <br />I have to say, PC Cast is one of my favorite authors!  While she is following the \\"Goddess\\" theme, I really feel like each of the stories is very unique and different.  The ending of GODDESS OF LIGHT totally caught me off guard and actually worked for me.    I also just want to add that never having been to Vegas, I can only imagine, but I really liked the visual description of the Bellagio fountains. <br /> <br />Pamela has been seriously hurt by her failed marriage.  For this reason, she has dedicated herself to work, shutting men out of her life in regards to dating and romance.  While Apollo is very charming, their relationship does seem a tad rushed, but magic is involved and he really is a God among men. (sigh!)  So all and all, what should be a weekend fling turns into much more when the twins become mortal for a week.   <br /> <br />The relationship between siblings is a tad obsessive, but I enjoyed watching Artemis grow as an individual to where she finally understands what her brother wants:  True Love.  She goes from being self-absorbed to willing to help him...it totally touched my heart. <br /> <br />While there really isn't your traditional \\"villain\\", Bacchus, the troublesome, fun loving god of wine is both the cause for Pamela and Apollo meeting and the trouble between the gods.  He is a petulant child that doesn't want to share (his \\"kingdom\\" of Las Vegas) and as a result, we have a very amazing story.  In the end, I think I really just feel sorry for him. <br /> <br />I'm sorry for being cryptic here, but this is a story well worth the read and I recommend GODDESS OF LIGHT.	2005-09-13

Dragged from his bed in the middle of the night, Craig Thibodeaux finds himself facing the bayous Voodoo Queen.  When he is cursed for NOT being interested in her granddaughter, Craig thinks it's a joke until he wakes up the next morning a frog!  Suddenly he starts taking the Voodoo Queen seriously and realizes he has less than two weeks to get a woman to fall in love with him or spend the rest of his life as a bullfrog, and he doesn't have a prospect to even start with. <br /> <br />Elaine Smith is a genius dedicated to her research.  But when she finds her fiance making out with another woman and he accuses her of being more interested in her work than him, she realizes the truth in his statements.  So, rather than sending an intern to collect the water samples she needs from Bayou Miste, she decides to get out of her laboratory and goes herself. <br /> <br />I liked Craig as a human because while he knew he had to find some one to fall in love with him, he wasn't out to hurt or use anyone to break his spell.  Elaine walks into his life and seems like the perfect target but because she is so innocent and naive he didn't want to break her heart because he didn't want to settle down.  I got more than a few laughs from his frustration of being a frog - getting stuck in a room because he couldn't open the door, for one.   <br /> <br />Elaine does a lot of growing as a character - she gets out of her lab, associated with other people that aren't scientists and learns that just because she is a child genius, she didn't have to give up her life as an adult too.  Another reason I like Elaine is because she is easy to fluster - Craig is one of the best looking guys she has ever seen.  So sometimes her brain mixes the yummy thoughts she has about him with the actual conversation she is having with the man.  Some of her misspoken words were funnier than others, but this was hilarious! <br /> <br />Elle James has written a truly enjoyable fractured fairy tale with her versionTO KISS A FROG.  This was such a fun read!  The story has a quick light pace and even the final confrontation was humorously written.   If you are looking for a light funny read this is a book that I would recommend. <br /> <br />reviewed for: pnr.thebestreviews.com	2005-05-24

The title intrigued me; and I really enjoyed the story. <br />  <br />Jane Drysdale, after hosting a successful \\"Pleasures of the Realms\\" party has a flat tire on her way home causing her to crash her car, but in the process runs over a bunny.  What should have been just a car accident turns into a murder trial when her rescuers take her to Loweth where she is to stand trial for the murder of Tivat. <br />  <br />In the beginning of the story, Jane is argumentative and disgruntled; I can totally appreciate her bitchiness and confusion at finding herself in a foreign world.  But rather than staying this way, she adopts a \\"bring it on\\" attitude that made her (for me) a remarkable heroine. <br />  <br />Charlie is an all around great Whelphite, however he tries to stay unnoticed - he's half elf and fairy and is very self-conscious.  Getting told he will be Jane's legal council becomes a challenge for numerous reasons but primarily because he spends a lot of time trying to follow Jane's train of thought; she is an avid watcher of Earths' TV reruns. So half the time he is clueless regarding whatever Jane is talking about.  Despite this, or maybe because of this, Charlie still cares for her rather than treating her like someone who is psychotic. Trying to keep up with Jane makes him deal with his heritage and he starts to live.  So pairing these two together was great. <br />  <br />One of the things that really makes this story exceptional is that while Jane was on trial for murder, the trial really only encompassed a couple chapters of the book.  The rest of the story is about what happens after the trial...which is really an epic journey through the entire kingdom for Jane.  I would really like to say more here, but there is so much discovery that I don't want to spoil anything! <br />  <br />The only thing I didn't care for with this book is the sexual encounters between Jane and Charlie.  While there is a lot of chemistry between the characters, their joinings are abit on the frantic side of aggressive for me.  It was kind of like if we don't hurry up and mate, one of us is going to change their mind.  Which wouldn't happen because both characters where drawn to each other like a moth to a light. <br />  <br />Cheryl Sterling has a fantastic imagination for writing fantasy and did a wonderful job subtly reminding the reader that the story takes place in another world.  What I thought was going to end up happening was off base, so the ending was a total surprise - that was amazing!  While the story isn't laugh out loud funny, it does have its moments.   WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A NAKED ELF? is fast paced and thoroughly enjoyable, I highly recommend this book for a fun read. <br /> <br />reivewed for: pnr.thebestreviews.com	2005-05-24

In Hans Christian Andersens' classic tale of THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES, two tailors extort large sums of money from a gullible Emperor who is obsessed with fashion.  In this fractured fairy tale written by Victoria Alexander our tailors become Ophelia and her younger sister Jenny.  Ophelia is tired of living on the run and gambling for her next meal. The only problem is, she's only one step ahead of breaking the law and can't win enough money gambling to be able to settle down.   <br /> <br />Which lands her in Dead End, Wyoming sitting on someone else's luggage.  So when she is mistaken for the Countess of Bridgewater, maybe she is finally having the break she needs.  Posing as the Countess and with a little luck, she should be able to scam the citizens of Dead End (who want to become a respectable community) out of some of their money...enough to set her and Jenny up for the rest of their lives! <br /> <br />The citizens of Dead End seek respectability, and are good, decent people.  Our hero, Tye has recently returned from completing his education and then traveling abroad.  With him, is his classmate, and friend Sedge Montgomery, the second son to a legitimate Earl...who right away knows that \\"Countess\\" Ophelia is a fraud.  Tye has his suspicions, but can't prove them...so logically the best way to discover the truth is to lure Ophelia into his bed, because everyone knows a woman can't keep a secret from a man.  Only things aren't going as planned... <br /> <br />I didn't have a problem with the idea of Ophelia gambling but I did have a problem with her trying to scam Jack and Lorelei (Tye's Uncle and Aunt) out of money to buy a title along with property in England not hers' to sell.  I had a very sick feeling of impending doom in my stomach reading through this part of the story, and therefore had a very difficult time getting past this part of the tale and into the romance (so basically great first chapter, then had a problem with the rest of the first third ofthe book).   <br /> <br />However, reading further allows the reader to find out that Ophelia isn't doing a very good job acting as a Countess and I spent a couple of chapters trying to figure out if Jack knew she was trying to scam him.  This made the story more entertaining for me, especially since nothing goes as planned for our heroine.    <br /> <br />I guess in hindsight, I wasn't sure what to expect.   Andersen's version of THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES was never one of my favorite fairy tales.  All and all, Ms Alexander's version of THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES is a humorous, well written romantic read.  But, as I mentioned, I had a problem with the initial deception and I think this spoiled the story for me. <br /> <br />NOTE:  This book has just been reissued, and the copy I read was published in 1997.	2005-05-02

I got a hoot out of Alaska becoming its own country because the US was too busy to buy it from Russia and that the royalty of Alaska seem like misplaced celebrities. <br /> <br />Christina works on a cruise ship and when she gets fired from her job one morning (she's tired of getting sexually harassed by her boss) she gets off in the port of Juneau, Alaska.  Then rather than finding a place to stay, spends the rest of her money on a fishing trip where she meets the most interesting man with a proposition to good to be true.  The King of Alaska, has just invited her to stay in the castle!  <br /> <br />While Christina's foul mouth didn't really bug me, I did have a problem with how quickly she got engaged, but then again, I liked her \\"why not me?\\" attitude (and it's not like she could do better!).  I just had a real hard time getting into Christina as a character.  I felt like she was portrayed as a rude, overly loud American that was full of herself.  Oh, well, she was.  I also had a hard time believing that she was so rude to all the people trying to help her!  To give examples, is to spoil the story... <br /> <br />Which is also part of the funny stuff.  I have to admit, I was drooling when she was describing the food for the wedding and I share Christina's lack of interest of shoes.  Why spend a huge amount of money when its not necessary?  So I have to admit that the wedding preparations had me busting up laughing.   <br /> <br />David and his fascination with his penguins...I really thought he was a kind of boring, try and stay out of the limelight kind of guy...so I just don't see how he and Christina can work as a couple...other than she fits right in with his siblings.  He is definitely the hero in disguise because he had a lot of hidden abilities that almost seemed out of place and character. <br /> <br />All in all, I love Mary Janice Davidson as an author and really enjoyed her take on Alaska.  (Thank you for mentioning the penguins were imported by the way!)  The story is fun and full of laughs, but there are a string of events that take place that rubbed me the wrong way.  I recommend this book, but THE ROYAL TREATMENT is not one of my favorite books she has written.	2005-04-14

Thrain has tracked down Cindy Harper, the daughter of Darach.  His wish is to tell Cindy of her heritage and reunite father with daughter and go on with his life.  Telling Cindy he is over 700 years old himself (rather than a vampire) Thrain finds himself drawn to her, which wasn't part of the plan.   <br /> <br />Cindy is proud of her hotel that caters to the people who want to be more than just human.  Being over 700 years old herself, she doesn't believe in the paranormal (she thinks she is a genetic fluke). Used to the unusual, why would she believe her life is going to change when two cosmic troublemakers and the sexiest man she has ever seen check into her hotel?   <br /> <br />When the humans start to get scared by the supernatural, Thrain helps her.  When a real werewolf and werecat get into a fight on her front lawn its only natural that Thrain help her work things out to slowly introduce Cindy to a world of supernatural...a world that contains Cindy's greatest fear. <br /> <br />NIGHT BITES continues the story from THE MASTER OF EXTASY two hundred and something years later...so you can read NIGHT BITES first, but there are a lot of spoilers...in my opinion anyway.  While I think NIGHT BITES moves at a faster pace than MASTER and I enjoyed the story more overall; I can't give the story 5 stars because I wasn't as interested in our leading couple as I was the secondary characters! <br /> <br />I'm greatly enjoying the series that Nina Bangs has started but I really get the impression that Sparkle and Ganymede are more prominent characters than the average secondary characters and for me there is a very fine line between rooting for the hero/heroine and rooting for secondary characters.  Sparkle Stardust and Ganymede are a hoot and I love Ganymede in the role of a cat but I really feel I should want to read the story to see what is going on between Thrain and Cindy.  Instead, I find myself more interested in reading the story to find out what havoc our cosmictroublemakers are contemplating next.   <br /> <br />Something else, according to the cover, Cindy seems to be really into ice cream, so I really thought there would be more inclusion of her eating the treat, however, it seems Ganymede is addicted to the stuff.  I just thought it odd how ice cream was played up on the cover, but not have it as something Cindy herself fell back on. <br /> <br />Regardless, NIGHT BITES has me laughing my head off.  I'm hooked on the series, so I am really looking forward to the next book, but I still wish I was more into Cindy and Thrains' part of the story.	2005-04-14

Finding out that one of the women taken in LOVE'S CAPTIVE had a brother, our story goes back to Earth, were our hero, Eric, a Green Beret, has been captured by the enemy.  Instead of dying from getting tortured, he is rescued (and healed) by aliens and taken to Volarn, where Eric is reunited with his sister Olga.  Now what?  Return to Earth? <br /> <br />Princess Kasha can't stand the fact that women are brought to their world to try and boost their flagging population growth, but more so because she know she will never be able to have her own mate.  When the earthman catches her fancy, she see's him as a way too have a romantic distraction.  Only Eric won't settle for anything less than marriage when all she wants is an affair. <br /> <br />Myra Nour takes us back to the planet of Volarn where even a crown princess can be in the military.  HEART OF THE DRAGON, to me, moves quickly, however, there are long passages with very little dialogue.  While this lets the reader see more of the sights, I did find myself wishing that the characters would tell me what they were seeing.  But don't plan on skipping paragraphs because a lot really does happen. <br /> <br />I really like Kasha as a heroine.  She is in the Getra (military) where it is her skills and abilities as a warrior that she is admired for not awarded to her because of her status.  At the same time she is still a woman and even though a little stuck up (she is a princess), she is able to realize she wants more than the lonely existence she has allowed herself (she has an interesting secret!).  It was fun to watch her grow emotionally and in the end fight for the chance to love Eric. <br /> <br />There is a dragon in this story that Kasha and Eric find while out trying to track down an animal that is killing small children.  Eric finds the dragon as a baby and names him Puff (after Puff the magic dragon...) however rather than being magical, Puff slobbers quite a bit, takes control of the story (for a little while) and had me laughing my head off.   HEART OF THE DRAGON, while actually referring to Eric, is worth reading, if for any other reason, Puff. <br /> <br />The people of Volarn have a Tarthra joining (which is initiated by the men) and will insure a love match. Because Eric is from Earth he cannot initiate the Tarthra, so in Kashas' eyes how could they suit?  The romance between Kasha and Eric is sweet as Eric really tries to teach her that how two people feel about each other is very important, that there is more to a relationship than a physical joining.  I got more than a few chuckles as Kasha tried to sway Eric into having casual sex, and Eric grouped with Jarvic, her cousin, quite frequently to avoid her.  It was a roll reversal of a sort which I thoroughly enjoy in stories! <br /> <br />Fast paced and witty, HEART OF THE DRAGON is a wonderful story that I really enjoyed.  While you can read the story alone, it takes place after LOVE'S CAPTIVE and Serena and Rhamus are in this story; so if you are like me you'll want to read them in order so you won't spoil the first story by seeing the happily ever after. <br /> <br />And what is going on with Jarvic?

My book reading buddy LOVED this book and I think this is probably the only book we haven't had an agreement on.  <br /> <br />Anyway, \\"Henry\\" drove me nuts!!  While I am all for the un-ladylike heroine that becomes a lady, I just couldn't get into Henry's character...she was to overbearing and a bitch and very unlikable to me.  I stopped reading the book when I kept finding myself wishing she would get the boot off the estate.  I don't know, I didn't feel the chemistry and didn't understand how Dunford could keep Henry around when it was with-in his rights to send her packing...yes this is a romance novel, but I really wonder if I would have liked the story better if she had gotten the boot. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm a big Julia Quinn fan and looking forward to the next novel she will publish, but I can't recommend this book, especially since I couldn't finish it. <br />	2005-03-17

You must read this book	First off, I just finished this book and knowing the sequel will be out in June (2005), has me chomping at the bit to read it... I also have to say that this book is worth every penny if you choose to buy it in paper format. <br /> <br />Before the wars started, two fathers hoping to end the tension between the clans betrothed Lachlan Douglas and Kimberly Kincade.  However, when a traitor to the Douglas' throws everyone into war, the marriage contract is forgotten, as clan Douglas becomes the enemy to all the other clans. <br /> <br />Many years later, Kimberly is a fighter pilot on the warship Shadowkeep.  Because she has doubts about the sanity of her commanding officer, Rama and his reasons for attacking a Douglas stronghold on Mars she is part of a secret resistance group trying to end the war.  But it isn't until she finds the first line Douglas on the Shadowkeep close to dieing from his injuries that Kimberly decides, for the sake of ending the war to rescue Lachlan. <br /> <br />Lachlan cannot believe that Kimberly is willing to aide him from escaping one of the men responsible for causing the war and warning his father about the up coming attacks on their other strongholds.  However, when Rama tracks them down and catches them, Kimberly again tries to aide his escape.  Even though it means his own death, Lachlan steps in front of a laser blast meant for her. <br /> <br />Grab your seat belts people and get strapped in, because R Garland Gray has written an extraordinary futuristic novel in space!  There is nothing simple about this plot line and while it's riddled with scenarios that will keep your nose glued to the book; her writing style is straightforward and easy to follow.   <br /> <br />One of my favorite things about this book is how the Celtic heritage has evolved.  For me, I love Scottish historicals and I love futuristics novels, so there couldn't be a more perfect combination than this book!  The keeps built on other planets are modeled after castles from Scotland on \\"Ancient Earth\\"; and while the hero doesn't run around in a kilt, he does wear armbands etched with his families' motto.  And lets not forget the Scottish brogue...it was just enough to remind you that our characters actually have a heritage (so it wasn't mentioned then dropped for the duration of the story), and not overwhelming by making you sound out your sentences because of words that are hard to pronounce. <br /> <br />While some of the more scientific occurrences that happen in DARKSCAPE seem like they should be far-fetched, I found them all the more interesting because, for example I've just been reading about how we (earthlings) are discussing terra-forming Mars...so the technology IS here and under discussion.  I really felt like Ms Gray did some research for our future living off of Earth.  Don't worry though, the science isn't overwhelming and don't get mislead, DARKSCAPE is an excellent romance, with some very passionate love scenes.    <br /> <br />R Garland Gray has done an excellent job, I think with her character development.  Someone betrayed Lachlan's family, and honestly, I was surprised by who it was.  Likewise, the enemy is so well written, he is someone you can easily hate, and I found myself unable to stop reading (but not the only reason) because I needed to make sure he got his comeuppance!  <br /> <br />If you like futuristic romances written by CJ Barry, Catherine Spangler or Linnea Sinclair, I highly recommend DARKSCAPE: THE REBEL LORD.	2005-03-11
US	24853483	R1MG8U3EMNK3HV	1931561648	798265328	The Time Traveler's Wife	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A true test of love throughout a lifetime	I must admit, as an avid reader of romance, and professing to love time travel, I didn't quite know what to think when my boyfriend gave me a copy of a mainstream novel that was a \\"Today Show Book Club\\" recommended novel.  Brain translation: recommended by Oprah or Good Morning America.  If the entirety of America is reading this book, it can't really be that much of a romance, or can it?<br /><br />Much to my surprise, THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE is a rare gem that draws you into the life of Clare and Henry.  Except rather than reading like a movie, it is more like a documentary.  Clare meets Henry when she is six (and he is much older) but when Henry meets her for the first time, he is 28 (and at the time, Clare is 20).  The days are all date stamped and give you the ages of our leading couple and an outline of the events that transpired on the date.  Quite frequently you get information from both of their perspectives.  Time expands and contracts as Henry travels forward and backward in time, some times causing him to encounter himself.<br /><br />While some reviewers found her writing style to lack in details and would have liked more information about the secondary characters, I really thought her ingenious.  There are so many small details that are easy to overlook but make you go \\"huh?\\" that later on in the story make sense.  I felt Clare and Henry were solid characters as well as very believable.  Just like I felt the information provided about the secondary characters was enough to make them solid and believable as our couples' best friends, but their lives don't overshadow and take over the story; they become more real because they have their own reality rather than are attached by strings to the main characters.<br /><br />I am amazed with Clare.  How many women can honestly say they have loved the man they will marry/did marry essentially their whole life?  Having Henry pop in and out of her life, it was more like she fell in love with her childhood imaginary best friend...except he wasn't imaginary, he just hadn't met her yet.  Then, the patience she has with Henry is amazing, because he can't control the time travel and quite frequently time travels when stressed...let your imagination fill in the blanks here!<br /><br />Henry is a true and tragic romantic hero.  Someone surrounded with an enormous secret (that miraculously few know about), whose life is constantly in danger (time traveling naked into the middle of a blizzard, or how-a-bout a back alley anyone?).  He is devoted to Clare, and yet, he cannot prevent the time traveling.  At the same time he still wants to have a normal marriage, job and life in general. I have to admit, I am amazed with his self control to not abuse his time travel abilities in regards to knowing the future.<br /><br />While Clare and Henry are in deeply in love, their lives are not glossed over and their emotions are so real and raw.  The story had me laughing so hard and then crying at the end.  But, the key is if you can travel through time, has the story really ended?<br /><br />THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE is such a good book and one you won't want to miss.imaginary best friend...except he wasn't imaginary, he just hadn't met her yet.

US	24853483	R39EAQAFS4P92M	1410401138	244542964	The Eternal Trust (Five Star Romance)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Fast paced story with a great heroine	For generations a samurai sword was handed down from woman to woman.  She would serve as a guardian for the sword, and pass it on to the next guardian before her own death.  The sword also calls the guardians' mortal soul mate, as well as attracting an untold evil and unscrupulous men only seeking its power.  <br /> <br />For Dorel Everly the ancient sword her Grandfather leaves her in his will couldn't have come at a better time.  She has just been laid off from her job, and is homeless (because the owners of the house she has been staying in are returning early).  Not expecting too much money from the sale of the sword, she goes to a local gun show. <br /> <br />Mike Gabrielli had always felt his life was lacking \\"something\\".  He knows historical facts that although accurate, very few people know.  He also has a fascination with weapons, especially ancient Japanese swords.  So when he goes to the gun show and encounters Dorel, it seems as if his life is finally starting. <br /> <br />Soon the couple is on the run from both the police and an enemy far worse.  Because Mike holds the sword, the power it contains consumes him.  Through visions of her most recent past life, Dorel knows that unless the eternal trust of the sword is somehow broken, she and Mike will die and the cycle will start all over. <br /> <br />Melinda Rucker Haynes has written an intense book.  I was very impressed with her writing style.  To me, it seemed to flow from one heart-racing occurrence to the next.  <br /> <br />I really like the idea of having a connection to finding your soul mate in every life.  However, the tension between Mike and Dorel is constantly there; and because of the situation they are in, I really wonder if it was the type of attraction that comes more from your life being in constant danger.  If not for the eternal trust, (which I also thought has a unique purpose behind it) if they had met under normal circumstances, would they have clicked as a couple?   <br /> <br />Dorel is an independent, intelligent woman.  Some of this was her soul learning from its mistakes; which I thought refreshing.  While she does have some \\"demons\\" that she has to overcome, I really like how Dorel was finally able to break the trust and thus free them from the control the sword appears to have.   <br /> <br />The Japanese heritage of the sword is a very important part of the story. I didn't find it overwhelming or get confused between the past and present history of the sword.  All of this, including tid-bits from the guardians previous lives helped add to my understanding of the trust.  Because of the multiple layers in THE ETERNAL TRUST, I think the story gained a depth that made the story more complex (and interesting) than your average contemporary paranormal romance.  <br /> <br />THE ETERNAL TRUST was a fast paced, well-written novel.  If you like suspense woven in with your story, I would highly recommend this book.	2005-02-01

In the future, it has been proven that there is no such things as ghosts or vampires.  So when Blythe goes on a working vacation in 1785 Scotland, why does she suddenly get the feeling that vampires and ghosts really do exist? <br /> <br />Darach just wants the meddlesome time travelers out of his ancestral castle so he can tend to his duty without endangering anyone.  Except Blythe, the woman bent on making him happy without succumbing to sex is the most vexing and interesting woman he has ever encountered! <br /> <br />Then the villagers get unsettled.  Women are traveling about by themselves, and peasants are gruesomely murdered during the night. So our time travelers and vampire must find a common ground, because there is something a lot worse than angry villagers moving about in the dark! <br /> <br />Nina Bangs has written a fanciful tale of magic, ancient Scotland and with a different view of the vampire.  While I enjoyed the story, and the plot was interesting, the pace was a little slower than I expected and would have liked. <br /> <br />For me, the secondary characters stole the book. While Blythe (who is also empathic) tries to convince Darach to let her see into his past to help him find happiness, I found myself wondering what Sparkle Stardust (a Cosmic Troublemaker) was up too.  I loved how Sparkle enjoyed thwarting Ganymede simply because he had renounced his status as a Cosmic Troublemaker.  The fact that she was also in cat form was a hoot!  Yet at the end, she proves she has a heart under all that white fur. <br /> <br />All in all, because the last eighty pages had me reading like crazy to know what would happen next, I have to say I enjoyed the story.  So, even though I had a hard time getting into the story I would recommend MASTER OF ECSTACY.	2005-02-01
US	24853483	R233UGACQFIBH5	1891437011	698054108	Misadventures and Merfolk	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A wonderful comedy of errors!	When Brenden James' thoughts' on his travels around the States get turned into a book, which becomes a best seller, he never expected the sequel to be a horrible flop.  Now, touring the British Isles, he is clueless as well as suffering from writers block on how to write another best selling novel which is the only way to save his writing career.  After all, how much can be said about old people and sheep?  When he is stranded on the Isle of Man (because his ferry sank) during the annual Mermaid Festival, suddenly, he feels the start of a story that should satisfy his publisher...    The seaside village of Heather Bay has women flocking to the town to try and find their soul mates; a young girl continues the habit of dressing up like a mermaid (started by her grandmother); and all of the local fishermen seek vengeance from \\"Charlie the Tuna\\".  Then there is the cranky lighthouse keeper that wrote a novel about mermaids, the Priest who wears a close pin on his nose and... AH Yes!  Story Heaven... But the longer Brenden spends in this \\"mad\\" town, the more fascinated he becomes with Christine, the local mermaid and the people of the town.  How can he put his satirical view on these small town people, which would cause them harm?    Kelly Reno has written a fantastic novel.  Besides that I adore the cover (Waterhouse is my favorite artist!) the book also includes pictures that give the story more of the \\"travel book\\" quality that Brenden is writing about.  This story actually gives you the feeling of being in a small town overrun with tourist during a festival.  I loved it!      I haven't read too many mermaid stories, so this is one of the attractions I had to MISADVENTURES & MERFOLK.  I was really happy with the \\"happily ever after\\" part of the story and found Ms Reno's merfolk fascinating.  Because Brenden is a total disbeliever in merfolk, you actually are discovering the culture along with him (very interesting actually!).  I really hope that there will be a sequelwritten about Charlie \\"the Tuna\\".         Each chapter is almost its own insane event, which leaves you satisfied with the what is happening (for example the parade) and yet aching to know what will happen next. So if you have short amounts of time to read during the day this book is perfect!  You can read a chapter, and then put the book down because you know what happened.  However, the energy of MISADVENTURES & MERFOLK will have you picking the story back up at the first possible opportunity because you want to know what will happen next!  This was so unique, and I found really enjoyable.    Besides the humorous events that take place between the pages, Kelly Reno has a very different writing voice than I am used too, and I loved it.  It was like watching a BBC special where everything is either insane or ...just not what it appears to be.  I don't think I can recommend this book enough!  I don't think anyone could be disappointed.	2004-11-26

I have to describe this book as AWESOME! <br /> <br />Lacey Garrett has answered an email requesting help from \\"zainman\\" only to find herself in the strangest dream she's ever concocted.  Only, it's not a dream. <br /> <br />Zain Masters, an intergalactic planet cartographer had his ship shot down while trying to check the planets surface, and is now stuck under a force field.  He needs help translating pictures and text to hopefully turn off the lasers and force field, Zain has beamed Lacey into his life-threatening predicament.  <br /> <br />Stuck in an unknown environment, Lacey rises to the challenges threatening her life in the form of \\"Bobzillas\\" - Godzilla like creatures that look remarkably like her ex-fiancee Bob. But what Lacey fights the most is the woman within.  After all, how can she fight the attraction that has been UNLEASHED for an alien?  <br /> <br />Ms Barry has a phenomenal ability weave a paranormal action packed romance that spans the universe.  I am blown away with her creativity.  I was amazed at how the story plot sucked me in as a reader and yet the bulk of UNLEASHED revolved around only Zain, his sentient space ship Reene, Lacey and her cat Oliver.  The \\"UN\\" series has me hooked, and with the introduction of Zains' sister, I'm hoping for another story. <br /> <br />As for our heroine, Lacey has had several rude awakenings in the last couple years of her life.  And while she was already very likeable, it was amazing to watch her bloom with Zains love.  Her fuzzy bedroom slippers cracked me up - what a mortifying way to get kidnapped by an alien!  <br /> <br />Zain, a man of mystery from UNEARTHED and UNCHAINED, finally has his story told. Used to working by himself, he has an ego (that gets him nowhere), but at the same time, has the ability to recognize he needs help.  The help he gets is from a human, who seems worldly but has normal fears that he takes the time to help Lacey through.  It melted my heart and I wasn't disappointed at all!<br /> <br />While the Bobzilla initially instilled fear in me, the way Lacey used them turned them into a major source of belly laughs.  I don't think I will ever think of Godzilla the same thanks to Ms Barry! <br /> <br />So, if you haven't read a book by Ms Barry yet, I highly recommend picking up this story.  Lacey falls into the category of a kick-butt and rescue her man heroine!  (Note: This is part of a series.  Yes, you can read it alone without any confusion.  But, in the first two novels, he is single...)	2004-09-21

Unknown at the time, the asteroid contained particles of some unknown substance that reformed the human anatomy, creating a human hybrid.   Dubbed the \\"Aurics\\" by the \\"normals\\" who feared their special abilities, only the Auric Rights League fights the Inter-Continental Police (ICP) who would destroy all of the Aurics.  <br /> <br />It is now the Earth year 2028 and Raven Armistead is devoted to her fathers' cause of bringing equal rights to the Aurics.  But when the ICP is about to bring online a tracking program that would be able to locate anyone with Auric abilities, she volunteers to destroy the computer lab. <br /> <br />Val Tarrant is a devoted ICP agent.  He is determined to eradicate all the Aurics from Earth.  However, when a new security guard saves his life when the ICP computer lab explodes, his life is turned upside down. <br /> <br />When circumstances throw Raven and Val together, they must put aside their grudges that they each harbor the other in order to prevent a more dangerous situation than either of them could possibly imagine! <br /> <br />Ms Dunne has written a very fast paced apocalyptic novel that kept me wondering what was truly going on until the end of the story.  The people of Earth live in fear and seem truly brainwashed to fear what they don't understand.  This so reminded me of the mass genocide of World War II, and the people that experienced mutations in X-Men.   <br /> <br />While Val and Raven are not fighting for the same side, they allow human compassion to show that they are still both mortal with the ability to aide each other while injured and save each other's lives.  I was actually very amazed that even though there was the \\"instant\\" attraction between them, that our couple actually used this as a reason to not trust one another.  It made for a very interesting and rocky relationship! <br /> <br />I think that RAVEN'S HEART has a very well developed plot.The cause that ends up uniting them was a very realistic concern and therefore more believable to me.  I also really appreciated the fact that both sides, the Normals and the Aurics, didn't instantly get along and that they worked through their fears rather than the sudden \\"Oh, well they get along so I guess we should too.\\"  But, what made the book for me, ...I can't say because it will give away the book!   <br /> <br />Awesome story!  I highly recommend RAVEN'S HEART!	2004-08-16

I've heard so many good things about this book.  However, I must admit, that as strange as this will sound, I didn't remember exactly WHY this book was so awesome.  But, I was sucked in instantly and knew I had to read the story myself.  UNDEAD AND UNWED is a true winner!   <br /> <br />Written totally from Betsy's view, UNDEAD AND UNWED takes place during the week following our intrepid heroines death.  She oversleeps, sits in gum, gets fired from her job, then while trying to get her cat out of the road, gets hit by a vehicle, and oh, all this on her birthday!  When she wakes up, much to her surprise, she finds herself in her least favorite color, a pink suit with cheap shoes!  Discovering she can't die, decides to get on with being a vampire and thus, a member of the undead. <br /> <br />There are so many things that are different with our heroine, Elizabeth Taylor, or Betsy, as she prefers to be called.  You always hear how fabulous, how beautiful, or plain but intelligent a heroine is.  Well, Betsy has blonde hair, is six feet tall, vain and although not very smart, has what I found to be a very offbeat sense of humor that had me laughing so hard. (I don't think I've laughed this hard since reading Dara Joys' KNIGHT OF A TRILLION STARS.)  And she has a shoe fetish, which although slightly strange, seems to lead to Betsy into many of her problems.  This ranges from terrorizing her 'step-monster' (gotta get HER shoes back after all!) to falling into the hands of the bad vampires. <br /> <br />Ms Davidson isn't afraid to have our heroine or even secondary characters curse up a blue streak, either.  Because it is consistent throughout the novel it flows, adds humor to otherwise stressful (or not so funny) situations and, well, works.  Likewise, there is plenty of sexual tension thru the book, with Betsy trying to fight off her attraction from our overbearing hero.   <br /> <br />My favorite situations are when conversations would take place with Betsy that were totally over her head and she would say, \\"Huh?  ...Okay, whatever!\\"  Thus totally playing up the vain and not-so-intelligent woman she is.  Because Ms Davidson never tried to make Betsy's character smarter than she really was.  This helped to add its own form of humor. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a totally new sort of romance, this book is for you.  Somehow Ms Davidson has broken the romance formula.  After reading some of the other reviews, it seems that both Laurell K Hamilton and Charlaine Harris are on this path, but I have yet to read any of their books.  However, I for one am going to order Ms Davidson's next book as well as add her to my auto-buy author list.  I can't recommend this book enough!	2004-08-13

She has an assignation placed on her at birth and therefore it is her destiny to be claimed by the evil sorcerer before her eighteenth birthday.  Instead her world is destroyed and she sets out on a path to avenge those who died and to seek out knowledge.   <br /> <br />Khamsin has been raised in the small village of Cirrus Cove and taught the Healing Arts and the magic necessary to help her survive.  While she dutifully married her husband, she doesn't know love.  Then on her eighteenth birthday, the Hill Raiders attack her village.  Rylan, the tinker rescues her after a horrible beating and saves her from getting hung as a witch.  Traveling with her cat Nixa and Rylan, she falls in love.  <br /> <br />Ms Sinclair became one of my favorite authors when I read AN ACCIDENTAL GODDESS (actually written as Megan Sybil Baker).  While it is one of my favorite books WINTERTIDE is actually the prequel, so read this one first!  They are stand-alone books, but so much of the history becomes clear reading them in order. <br /> <br />WINTERTIDE is a journey for Khamsin that tests everything she believes in from who the Hill-Raiders are to the Gods she prays too, as well as those she doesn't.  Khamsin has so many bad things happen in her young life it is amazing!  However rather than giving into defeat, she uses each tragedy to become stronger so she can free the country from the fighting demigods by destroying the Orb of Knowledge.   <br /> <br />While it seems like Khamsin is alone most of the story, I was drawn to the visual images as well as emotions that Ms Sinclair has written.  This applies to everything from the varying scenery to the eeriness portrayed by the crows.   <br /> <br />I love Nixa, her cat.  While most secondary characters are human - Nixa, I think fills this roll.  She has a mental bond with Khamsin that adds joy to the story that alleviates tension.  Also, her simple presence and single word thoughts made me laugh. <br /> <br />I thought WINTERTIDE was a very well written novel that invokes a wide range of emotions.  I'm so glad Ms Sinclair's novels will get printed mainstream because she is an exceptional author and one I think everyone should know about.  You can't miss this book!	2004-08-13

However, she is a woman on a mission and wrapped in her own hidden agenda.  When she puts aside a family grudge too help her younger sister try and prevent an unwanted marriage, she sees her parents for the first time in years.  While constantly sabotaging the life of Alex Raiford, the attraction that blooms between the two could ignite a forest fire. <br /> <br />Alex wants a biddable wife even though he is drawn to Lily and her outlandish way of living.  He has loved before, and his fianc was thrown from a horse, and died.  He doesn't want to ever have to deal with falling in love with anyone and having to face that type of loss again.   <br /> <br />Okay, WOW!  THEN CAME YOU is so thoroughly engrossing, I had a hard time coming up for air!  Ms Kleypas has a writing style that sucks you in and keeps the story well organized so you don't get lost or confused.  Her characters are well developed and I felt, very believable.  Lily is one amazing woman; she is so full of life and strength that she is easily one of my favorite heroines.  Alex has so many chances to publicly humiliate her, yet you fall in love with his compassionate side even as he fights against himself (trying not to fall in love).   <br /> <br />Additionally, I really liked the secondary characters, and am so glad that Derek will have his own story (DREAMING OF YOU).  It tore at my heart that he didn't think he was good enough for Lily, but at the same time he protected her...even when Lily didn't think he was acting in her best interests. <br /> <br />While the bad guys get their due in the end and our couple gets together, there are so many interesting twists that THEN CAME YOU will end before you are ready.  I recommend reading this book when you know you can read the tale from start to finish! <br />	2004-07-29

Ms Kennedy has written a where technology is lost, huge creatures of the sea rule the planet and people live in giant trees that serve as cities and land. I love this world! It's a different version of Kevin Costners' WATERWORLD, but one I found so much more believable. Monsters still live underwater and giant birds of prey (think flying dinosaurs) live above the tree canopy. The forests are so beautiful thru Maris' eyes and described so well by Ms Kennedy. There is both beauty and danger in the jungle; were animals are familiar, and yet and the same time so different than our Earth animals.          Zabba root is coveted by the Royals, as is the true history of Mahris's people hidden by them as well. Zabba, from what I understand, opens the mind, and depending on the person's tolerance depends on the extra-sensory abilities allowed.          While the attraction between Mahri and Korl has a lot of chemistry and sparks flying, Mahri fights the attraction' at the same time it's an instantaneous union. She doesn't trust him, yet she is too easy on him. Regardless, I really liked Mahri as a woman. She is strong, independent and yet discovers she needs more to be complete. Korl is strong and is studying the Healing arts to help his people. He is a healer first, then the crown prince. However, with Mahri he is tenderhearted (like all hero's should be) yet still manages to have the arrogance you would expect as due his station of Crown Prince. I felt he was the epitome of a good alpha hero.          Jaja, Mahris' pet is part monkey-part fish, as well as telepathic. In my mind I had such a visual of all his facial expressions that between his actions and his personality I laughed out loud.          BENEATH THE THIRTEEN MOONS is such an awesome story! I only hope Ms Kennedy has plans for future novels as I highly recommend this novel.     This book was reviewed for: [...]	2004-07-29

She has bought the old mill, and wants to renovate the building to convert it into a bookstore/coffee stand.  It is while out horseback riding that she encounters Matt Granite, who she has had a crush on since a teenager.<br />Matt Granite has had a crush on Kate since she was a teenager and he was in college.  He has been waiting for her to visit home, so he is ecstatic when he finds out she has returned to Sea Haven permanently.  Then, while encountering her on the roadside, there is a violent earthquake.  Because he works in construction, Matt quickly agrees to help Kate remodel her mill and even volunteers to make sure there wasn't any structural damage.<br />What the couple finds is an unknown evil force that has been buried beneath the mill, sealed in a tomb by a Drake ancestor.  With little time to spare as the evil is attacking everything to do with holiday cheer the seven Drake sisters and Matt join together.  But will their combined strength be enough to stop it from growing?<br />Like other reviewers, I am a big fan of Ms Feehan and her Carpathians.  With THE TWLIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, she has another hit series in the making.  What I didn't know (and after reading this story now makes sense) is that this is the second story in the series.  This story is SO different from her Carpathian series.  I would classify this story as a romantic suspense, because I was scared witless!  I had creepy horror music playing through my head during half of the story.  So I suppose this is a good thing if you like that sort of thing.<br />I really appreciate the fact that when the sisters weren't fighting the mist they had a light and playful humor.  But I think there were too many characters all at one time for me.  It wasn't until the end of the story when I finally felt like I knew who was who.  Because of all the characters vying for time in the story, I felt cheatedof getting to know Kate and Matt.  I feel that more time could have been involved with them discussing renovation plans or what they had been doing with their own lives (and made the book longer) rather than some of the snippets of time spent with the family.  I like both of the characters from what I know of them, but I didn't feel like I've gotten to KNOW Kate and Matt.  I really felt this was a let down, because in other novels Ms Feehan has written, I felt like I knew the characters as people rather than just being a reader; so I felt a little cheated in this aspect.<br />However, I am proud of myself for finishing the story because the mist really freaked me out.  I have to say that this was a really well written story and I really like the idea and concept of a family of witches.  I would be very interested in reading Jacksons' story, but I think I'm gonna stick with the Carpathian series because I don't ever remember ever being so scared over a book!  So I have to say I'm neither for, nor against THE TWILIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.	2004-07-01
US	24853483	RHH9KJWRLU707	0505524694	303549991	Out of the Blue	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Makes me almost want to get kiddnapped by aliens!	When Maryellen woke up in the morning, it should have been another routine day for the workaholic graphic artist.  Instead, Sub-commander Targon made his presence known as a disembodied voice coming from inside her.  This turns out to be just the beginning of Maryellen's life changing experiences.<br /> Ur Targon is certain that his cohorts placed him into Marellens' body as a practical joke; but he's not laughing.  On a top secret, urgent mission to save the US President, Targon needs a body of his own.<br />From cab accidents with police cars to group therapy in pyramids (with Trekies and Star Wars fans) OUT OF THE BLUE has a little bit of everything.  Katherine Deauxville hardly gives the reader time to recover from one shocker (that has you groaning in mortification) before she makes you laugh out loud again.  I especially liked the results of going hunting for an appropriate body.  Gads, that was a hoot! (Am I tempting you to read the book yet?)<br />While I greatly enjoyed this story, I had some issues with several things.  Maryellen's sister Felicia drove me nuts!  I think she was very sweet at the same time but it was like she never listened to her sister.  Rather than noticing typographical errors etc, I noticed a couple of inconsistencies with Maryellen herself (was she a virgin or not? Sorry, but this really confused me!).  I also thought Maryellen and Felicia were a little pretentious.  As I've never read a book by Ms Deauxville before, I don't know if it is just the characters, or her writing style.  Despite how this paragraph might sound, I did like Maryellen.  She was resourceful, even if she was out of her league dealing with Targon. <br />I do like the way Ms Deauxville alternates between the primary characters, the secondary characters Wolf Madder from the FFI, and then the therapy group.  It gave the story a feeling of knowing what is going on for all three parties at the same time without overloading the reader.  I thought this was really well done.  <br />While Targon is certainly overbearing and a pain in Maryellen's life, he is a hoot!  He has the capability of taking a semi solid form only for short periods of time.  During this time he glows kind of like a thousand watt light-bulb, which is a problem in it's own.  He has a &quot;guide book&quot; of Earth culture that adds to the humor; &quot;invents&quot; a great drink in champagne and orange juice - which has funny results.  And lastly, I think the body he ends up finding actually matched his personality in a way!<br />As this is a romance, the characters are intimate, but the scenes are insinuated rather than graphically written out.  (Which I can respect.)<br />All in all, OUT OF THE BLUE is outrageously funny and if you have the chance to read the story, it's a great contemporary romance that I would recommend.	2004-04-30
US	24853483	R14FP2EJ4SP9S0	189389634X	442367582	Kindred Spirits	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A fantastic novel - Two thumbs up!!	Marcus Van Buren and Daisy Malone have gotten married (from SCANDALOUS SPIRITS) and are off on their honeymoon.  Still wanting to help his deceased relatives cross over and thus vacate his mansion, Marcus has hired Thaddeus Bookman, a professional when it comes to helping ghosts cross over, to get rid of them.  However when Izzy scares one of the construction workers with her ghostly shenanigans, its Rufus Sinclair that has to come out to Atlantic City and cool down the spooked workers to keep the events out of the press.<br />Rufus hates dealing with the ghostly Van Buren family, and had hoped to never have to return to the mansion.  However, when he arrives at the crumbling house, Bookman informs him that he will need to deal with Izzy seeing as she has a crush on Rufus.  That and several trunks were found (thanks to the construction workers accidentally destroying a wall) that she won't let him see all the contents of.  In the trunk was a picture of a man that looked a lot like Rufus, standing with pilot and friend of Izzy, Grace LaRue.  Certain that the picture might be a key to helping Izzy cross over, Bookman convinces Rufus to try and talk to her, and gets Rufus blown out the tower window because of Izzy's ghostly pain.<br />Waking up in the bushes Rufus comes face to car grill of a living, very not-a-ghost Izzy of 1923 and Grace LaRue.  Claiming amnesia, Rufus is named Julius Caesar by Izzy and Ace by Grace.  For Rufus, stuck in the roaring twenties with speakeasies and the sexual liberation should have been fabulous.  However, he suddenly finds himself physically attracted to good girl Grace, with a love sick Izzy always on his heals.  Refusing to believe he is the drifter in Bookmans' photo, Rufus tries to stay \\"low\\" and not change history. But how can he figure out what is preventing Izzy from crossing over when he desperately wants to stay in 1923 and be a part of Graces life?<br />CB Scott has written another fantastic novel!  I loved Rufus as a character in the first novel so am overjoyed he has his own story.  Through Rufus, we get to experience a police raid on the speakeasy the siblings James and Izzy took too as well as the adrenaline rush of wing walking.  Rufus is a man that lives to help others and therefore doesn't have his own goals.  He is afraid of relationships that have any stability and while enjoys flying it's more a means to an end rather than done for pleasure.  <br />When he meets no nonsense Grace who doesn't need a man in her life, except as a business partner...she makes him think about things he would rather not.  Raised by her grandfather, Grace has followed her dreams.  She's a daredevil stunt pilot that has been wronged by her previous partner. While she knows she doesn't want to marry her childhood friend Mick, she can't figure out the attraction she feels for Rufus ignited by a kiss.<br />Izzy is a lonely self-centered woman who hides behind her parting happy facade.  While she is desperately trying to get Grace to marry Mick, it now serves a dual purpose.  She wants her friend to have the happiness of marriage, and now more so she can have Rufus all to herself.  At the same time, she is trying to avoid old fuddy-duddy Roy, whom her family would like to see her marry.<br />While I generally shy away from love triangles, this one isn't what I expected.  Izzy is ga-ga over Rufus, Rufus is confused about his instant attraction of Grace and Grace is in denial of her attraction to Rufus, so the situations were funny and no one was clueless about what was going on.  KINDRED SPIRITS is an incredible story involving reincarnation, time travel and falling in love.  CB Scott writes so well that I couldn't put the book down.  One minute I was laughing, then biting my nails, and then holding my breath as tears streamed down my face.  The ending of this book was perfect, although, I really wouldn't have minded if the story was longer...<br />Two thumbs up, and I highly recommend this book.  I can hardly wait to see what they write next!	2004-04-23
US	24853483	R1EZR5Q2K0RLLO	1893896234	66063821	Scandalous Spirits	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A must read for anyone who enjoys humor with their romance	Daisy Malone is in need of money quick to save her family from financial ruin so declaring Laguna Vista \\"ghost free\\" should be easy...even though she's been infatuated with one of the ghostly residents since childhood.  All she has to do is conduct a sham of an investigation for a couple days and convince the three siblings to move on to the after life...or lie.  She never counted on the sexy absentee owner showing up, moving in and getting chummy with her family!<br />When Marcus Van Buren finds out his \\"ex\\"secretary/best friend hires an amateur to rid his ancestors from his mansion, he finds himself on the doorstep of the very property he never wanted to see again and intends to sell.  Dealings with Daisy never go as planed either.  <br />For a first novel, CB Scott is off to a fabulous start.  SCANDALOUS SPIRITS was such a fun (and funny!) read!  A contemporary novel, the story has a very solid paranormal element involving the ghosts who are from the roaring 20's.<br />Every time the two come together, sparks fly.  Marcus is frustrated because Daisy has a fascination with his dead grandfather and can't help his growing attraction to the amateur  ghostbuster.  Bound and determined to show Ms Malone that not all the Van Buren men are philandering rakes, Marcus finds himself suddenly doing things he never thought possible.<br />I loved Daisy.  Her hiking boots made me laugh.  But even though she conceals a pretty shocking secret as to why she has a hard time with Marcus, I still found her inner strength added humor to most of her conversations with him.  (Think someone to used to saying what is on her mind, but generally at the wrong moment).  Then there is the equipment to get rid of the ghosts...that she hardly knows how to use.  Her family is a hoot, it's a tough choice between her sister Jill, and mother (who totally decks the house and yard for the holidays) as to which family member made me laugh more.  <br />...And finally, then there are the ghosts... Whileeach of them has their own enduring qualities and Daisy is obsessed with Jonas, I really think Izzy (Isadore) is my favorite.  She is like a petulant child with a crush on Rufus, and not getting anything she wants!<br />SCANDALOUS SPIRITS is an all around terrific novel.  It has everything, great laughing material, stuff that will touch your heart and maybe make you cry (okay, I cried).  The end is perfect and gives you a couple surprises as well!  I can't recommend this story enough!	2004-04-20
US	24853483	R2874ESL68AIPC	0060513640	301232992	One Night of Scandal (Fairleigh Sisters)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Another great novel by Ms Medeiros!	The night of her debutant ball finds Carlotta (Lottie) Fairleigh trying to sneak a peek in the window of the house next-door in hopes to see Hayden St Clair who called out and shot his friend for sleeping with his wife, then killed her as well.<br />For Hayden, the last night in London before he can return to Cornwall proves disastrous.  When his friend Ned sends a &quot;little present&quot; he only assumes the lovely beauty peering in his window is &quot;the present&quot;.  <br />Faced with ruining her family, Lottie convinces Hayden they must marry and then the couple heads to his estate in Cornwall.  Once there, Lottie discovers that her husband has more secrets than even the ton could imagine and determines to clear his name of the title &quot;Murderous Marquees&quot;.<br />Ms Mederious has woven together another excellent novel.  ONE NIGHT OF SCANDAL, while I guess is technically a historical has a touch of gothic influence that surrounds Haden.  But before events can become stressful to the reader, our characters allow their lighter sides to show.  For an additional treat, Lottie has several pet cats that are enjoyable &quot;extras&quot;.  <br />The relationship that Lottie and Allegra, Hayden's estranged daughter develop is interesting and comical to watch as the little girl has no desire to have a new mother.  The antics she puts Lottie though lead to a screaming match that servers to finally unite the two in a common purpose - bring Hayden back from the overwhelming guilt he feels over the death of his wife. <br />While Hayden and Lottie have a marriage in name only, (and more so than other romances I've read), I did find how the two fell in love a little confusing.  To me, it seemed like they hardly spent any time together to be able to get to know one another as people.  However, the passion between the two is masterfully written.  Despite this, ONE NIGHT OF SCANDAL is a novel that was hard to put down and I thoroughly enjoyed.	2004-04-20

When she takes the soul of a boy, his mother curses her.  Only the death of a loved one in her arms can free Arina from her human body so she can become an angel again.  <br />Daemon, branded and named a demon, only wishes to fight in hopes it will bring his death.  Instead, the Norman finds himself the unwilling Lord of Brunneswald Hall.  Finding a gorgeous woman who has lost her memory and isn't afraid of him also wasn't part of his plan.<br />Sherrilyn Kenyon fans beware!  I have read ALL of her stories and love them!  HOWEVER, I didn't like this story!<br />Daemon is a tortured hero, cursed in the eyes of God and very worthy of being a Dark Hunter.  But Arina is a religious fanatic and I didn't care for her at all.  With other medieval romances I've read the author(s) either toned down or lost completely the religious aspect of the hero/ines life.  Having religion in the story became old; then it drove me nuts!  While I can accept religion, I don't want to read about it. I think Ms Kenyon has done a good job at keeping religion in her heroines' life, but at the same time is what turned me off.  <br />Arina is probably a great Angel, but I think I'll stick with Dark Hunters.  The story was depressing, and I was a tortured reader (with this as my reading material on an international flight!!) so I can't recommend DAEMON'S ANGEL.	2004-04-17

Not expecting him to survive the fever consuming him, Sophia accepts.  Finally free from societies restrictions, when Sophia hears of Anthony's death, she leaves London and returns to Staffordshire to live with her Aunt and pursue her own life as a spinster.  However, recovering from his injuries, Anthony pursues Sophia only to discover that the woman he intends to marry has no desire to marry at all and in truth only agreed with the expectation he would die.  <br />Unable to except the fact that Sophia doesn't want to get married he starts to woo Sophia in a most unusual courtship.  Trying to learn how to serve a lady (remember military man - used to serving no one), he temporarily takes the position of her Aunts butler.  Believing that Anthony only wants the perfect wife &quot;the Ice Queen&quot; she portrayed in London, Sophia wants to scare him off and agrees to go on one date if Anthony will stop being her aunt's butler.  When he agrees, Sophia decides to have him escort her to a cockfight...not knowing what one is.  She does everything she can think of to prove she couldn't and wouldn't be a proper wife!<br />Ms Greyle has written a fanciful tale of how not to court a wife!  Anthony needs to learn that to woo, he must flatter.  Sophia must discover that not all men are looking for a wife that will simply obey but that some men want a wife that can converse intelligently and be a partner in life.   <br />While Anthony acquires a few unlikely allies, I must admit he is a hero that has to grow on you.  He is overbearing and arrogant, the reasons Sophia doesn't want to marry him.  I think Ms Greyle did a wonderful job with Anthony.  He has the gruffness that you would expect him to have and yet as a reader you can visibly see the changes that he makes so he can more appropriately court Sophia.  I found Sophia herself amusing in the creativity she displays in trying to get rid of her unwanted suitor.  However Ialso thought she was mean to Anthony, because he continuously wouldn't take &quot;no&quot; for the final answer. She continually resists him even though they obviously have feelings for each other and there is chemistry between them.  <br />Of course there are meddling friends as well.  It is these friends that pair the couple up in the most unlikely of situations; for example, by going to visit the local crazy man! <br />MAJOR WYCLYFF'S CAMPAIN is just this; a campaign and a historical unlike I've ever read!  While there aren't humorous one liners, you can find yourself groaning at Sophia's outrageous plans she always loses control of in the desire to continually thwart Anthony and falls in love with the man.  She unknowingly is molding him into - her perfect husband!  A great read that I would recommend!	2004-04-14

She is on a mission to become an angel and the only way to do so, Carolly believes is through selfless deeds.  <br />James Northram, Earl of Traynern was quite content with his life until it was turned upside down by a woman who had to have escaped from bedlam.  With warm smiles and talk of other lives, James only wants to help Carolly realize she is not living in the now, even as he slowly falls for the woman in his care.  But for Carolly, who only wants to find James a wife and get her wings, trying to not fall for James is harder than she, &quot;almost an angel&quot; can even handle.<br />Ms Greyle has written such a touching story!  Carolly has gone from a woman bent on her own pleasure to trying to help others.  Even though you don't know much about her first life, you do know that she caused her own accidental death.  Now, while some of her decisions will make you shudder with mortification because James thinks she has lost her mind, the pair will have you laughing as Carolly allows him to &quot;to have the final say&quot; in the arguments.  <br />While James has an adamant belief that Carolly was from the mental institution, I thought it odd he defended her so adamantly that she was sane.  I wanted to weep when Carolly started to get &quot;better&quot; and I had to cheer when James realized he was falling in love with vivacious woman that she had been, not the woman she was becoming.<br />I have mixed emotions when it comes to angel and ghost stories; I have a hard time with some of the endings.  While I really enjoyed ALMOST AN ANGEL and there is a fantastic climax to the story, I was disappointed with the very, very end of the story (Does Carolly get to stay and love James, or does she get her angel wings and go to heaven?).  But, I seem to be in a minority about how people feel about this type of ending. Overall, ALMOST AN ANGEL was a wonderful, heart warming,laugh-out-loud story.	2004-04-14

Constantly seeing her in her garden, Tristan Wemyss, Earl of Trentham instigates a meeting between the two.  Instantly he's intrigued.  Then things get interesting at the club, which is still under renovations, when the building gets broken into.  As Tristan keeps &quot;accidentally&quot; running into Leonora and both are plagued with the same brake-ins, the couple join forces to solve the mystery.  <br />When Leonora is attacked on the street the &quot;firmly on the shelf&quot; wallflower decides she wants to know what she will miss by never marrying.  Her charming next-door neighbor seems the perfect rake to have a secret tryst with.  Only having Tristan suddenly becoming a proper gentleman and proposing was never part of her plan! <br />I finally finished THE LADY CHOSEN!  Wow - it took me almost two months to read.  Before you choose to skip this book, know it has an excellent mystery wrapped within a very sensuous romance.  My dilemma was that the first 150 or so pages really drag.  There is a lot of day-to-day activity without anything interesting really happening.  (After thought, I don't think this is meant to loose the interest of the reader but more to express the frustration of Leonora's situation - wait, wait, wait, something happens, back to waiting; kind of like a stake out.)  The romance between Tristan and Leonora was interesting to watch develop because he wants to marry her, and she wants him, but not as a husband!  As he lays siege to her heart, it is roll reversal as the guy convinces the woman they are perfect for each other. <br />Just so both fans and prospective readers understand, I have not read most of her other books so if you have never read a book by Ms Laurens, I wouldn't recommend starting with this one because she is a wonderful author with a great story telling ability and I'd hate for you to miss the rest of her stories because you couldn't get into this one.  Because I couldn't get into this book, I have to rate it low. After the events in the story picked up, I was sucked in and enjoyed the story, but I think the book could have been a lot shorter; therefore easier to read!	2004-04-13

True love, soul mates, heartmate - they are the same on Celta where a group of humans with psychic talents settled to escape persecution from Earth.  Rand T'Ash is rough around the edges and to marry his Heartmate is his greatest desire.  Rands profession is a jeweler (he is a very talented one) and he has made an incredible necklace for only one woman - Danith Mallow.  The problems are that Danith can't see beyond their social differences and she feels unworthy because of her near null psychic talents.<br />Ms Owens has written an interesting story.  While Rand's ideas of courtship are humorous in a \\"he has no clue what he is doing\\" kind of fashion, I really felt that Danith was a little hard on him.  Both have the common background of being orphans.  Except Rand's family was murdered when he was a small boy and he survived.  After living on the streets he had to fight his way back to reclaim his family name while lacking the social skills of others in his class.   Because of his upbringing he was very straight forward, which I actually liked.  <br />For Danith, as an orphan her talents had been over looked and therefore not discovered.  Rand helps her through discovering them and to get the necessary training so she could use them.  This set them on equal status level and yet she still fought her attraction for him.  Sadly for me, this became old.  She wants to be with him, yet she doesn't.  Rand has a familiar that was his only \\"family\\"; this added humor to the story.  The way Zanth (the familiar) spoke and reacted to situations, I can see my own cats acting.  And while it wouldn't be a romance without the couples having problems and hero taking control, because of Danith the couple didn't work for me.  <br />The world is fascinating and sounds like a growing community where everyone should have their place, but is starting to face the same social class issues that occur for us on Earth.  Which is another reason Rand endeared himself to me because he was fightingto keep this from happening, where people just fall through the cracks for one reason or another.  <br />I would really be interested to read her future novels just to see what happens several years in the future with some of the kids from the street gangs.  Also I found the fact that they use their psychic talents much as we use technology fascinating.  I will read other books by Ms Owens as she has the ability to tell a wonderful story, but HEARTMATE was longer than I felt it needed to be.	2004-04-02

She is also a woman bent on trying to track down the wolf that tried to kill her twin sister.  And to do so, she bonds for the duration of the moon dance with Duncan Sinclair; the long absent son of the family that throws the moon dances where her sister was attacked.  However, Neva quickly looses control of the situation as Duncan is trying to solve the same mystery, because in addition to Neva's sister's attack, several women were killed. <br />Wow - so I've never read a werewolf novel like this.  I think I've always had the misconception that werewolves were humans that turned during the three days surrounding a full moon and where discontent with the existence because they turned into mindless killers.  (TV I guess...)  Keri Arthur has woven together a very sensual love story with a well-written mystery.<br />In a Colorado that has accepted the paranormal, the moon dance will have you rethinking the term casual sex.  While Neva and Duncan have a mystery that threatens more than the women attending the nightly dance, the focus of the book is trusting your heart, rather than just what you know as fact.  Duncan was a playboy in every way.  Can he reform or more to the point, has he reformed so that he could be happy with only one mate?  Neva represents tradition where although she believes in a life mate, fears breaking the mold set by her parents.  <br />This is a fabulous story that will accelerate your heartbeat both from the characters radiating sensuality and the mystery surrounding Duncan's family.  I was worried that the book would be too scary for me (I'm a wimp).  I was amazed that while it is a mystery, I wasn't traumatized as a reader so this was awesome!  BENEATH A RISING MOON is a werewolf novel you won't want to miss!  I hope Ms Arthur writes the story of Neva's sister, Savannah.	2004-03-31

In order to free the amulet, Cohl needs Tess to sing a complicated song from an extinct race of people; it will mean her life if she so much as messes up one note.  Tess, sees this as another duty that stands in-between her and her life long dream of a singing career.  But as the pair works together, she finds that duty isn't so bad when performed with someone you care about.  Now if only she can convince Cohl of this.  <br />With most novels, we have our complicated hero who is more than he seems.  UNEARTHED is no different.  Cohl is running from his noble past and while he loves his people, he doesn't want to be tied down to the planet.  Because of Tess, you can see him growing and developing as a character, but I had a really hard time with the fact that even though it was Tess who ultimately would put her life in peril, he wouldn't talk to her about the dangers she would face unless she nagged him; which justifiably annoyed Tess.  I guess I felt that even though it was a pretty grim task he was putting before her, he should have been more willing to help her prepare for it rather than try and conceal the dangers she would face.  Because of this, I wasn't sucked into the book as much as I would have expected.  On the other hand, I really liked Tess as a person.  Throughout the ordeal she remains positive expecting to be able to return home after acquiring the amulet.  Once back on Earth, she hopes she will be able to put her life back together and become a famous singer.  <br />Ms Barry has written a wonderful space adventure that was exciting to follow.  The planets you will visit are wondrous and because you are seeing them for the first time through Tess' eyes, I felt they were described very well.  I was fascinated.  But because Cohl never talks with Tess about important issues (and almost looses her to boot) I can't see how the relationship worked.  Even though they did fall in love, I have to go with 3 stars.  This is a great fantasy but the hero wasn't there for me.  I am however REALLY looking forward to the sequel!	2004-03-31

Also, the story sounds great, but there are huge gaping holes in the plot from start to finish.  The hero and heroine go from not being in love to madly in love and then the story is over.  You don't get to find out what caused Kieran to fall in love with Syren nor is there any resolution.  Yes, there is one great review.  If you read it, you pretty much have read the book.<br />Because I was so frustrated and disgusted with the first story, I couldn't even try to read the second.  I hate to give a bad review, but I would rather have been warned how bad the story was before buying something rather than only hearing it was great.  Especially since the book wasn't cheap.  SECRETS OF THE SEA is not worth its money.	2004-03-30

Brian Skelley has been working in the United Kingdom for the past year as part of an exchange program with the US Navy as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Expert.  When a training exercise literally blows up, he awakens to find himself in the year 1301, where he is taken to what should have been the ruins of Kilbeinn Castle.  Except instead he finds a village and a very enchanting miss.  Caira doesn't have time to deal with the deranged man that two of her clansmen bring back for her to heal.  With the death of her husband and father she has a castle to run and the English to keep away.  However, the man whose odd clothing identifies him as a storyteller does bring some joy back to her people with his fanciful stories.  While adamantly denying he is both English or a member of William Wallaces' men, Brian decides the best thing for him to do would be to try and recreate the explosion that blasted him into the past.  Getting involved with Caira isn't something he should do, but when he learns her secrets and her fears, he can't help but get involved. <br />A BLAST TO THE PAST is different with our hero going back in time rather than the heroine.  So as a reader we get to experience a unique time travel all together.  Brian is a man of strength and honor thrust into a situation he isn't really prepared for as a supposed storyteller.  I really think it is funny to think about how our movies today are just fanciful tales and the idea of retelling them to a group of people who live in a time of knights in shining armor is funny.  The two clansmen Malcom and Callum are a hoot as they bicker their way through the story over whether Brian is a member of Wallace's renegades.  Caira is a woman desperately in need of a miracle if she is going to keep her clan and home safe. Getting used to the dialect took me a while and I found myself reading it out loud; but the brogue is consistent throughout the story and was easy enough to pick up.  Ms Farmer has written a wonderful novel that combines time travel and Scottish history that shouldn't be missed!  While her previous two novels were light and fun, with A BLAST TO THE PAST she has proven her ability to weave an enchanting tale.	2004-03-28

His oldest memory is a white flash, which he has been told is an asteroid hitting the space station he had been on.  While Danny knows that something isn't right about his accident, and struggles to discover the truth, he fears that he might not in truth be the man everyone thinks he is.  However his reality is almost worse than knowing nothing.  His wife Kee cringes when he is near and the man he is supposed to be was a wealthy playboy, and the more he learns of himself, he discovers that 'Danny' isn't someone he wants to be.  Kee, is surprised when Danny returns and doesn't publicly denounce her.  The even bigger surprise is he tells her he has amnesia and needs her help to regain his memory.  The man who returns to her is a man she can love, but can she stay with him knowing the awful past they share that he is trying to recover?  <br />HEART OF THE HERO is a very interesting story that could very realistically be the earth's future.  Kee who should have fled before Danny's return has stayed in a doomed marriage built on lies and one night of passion.  Danny has no history except that of two men that, for all matters are dead.  Who does he want to be isn't the question, but who is he really?  I can see why this book would get mixed reviews.  I had a love hate relationship with the first half of the book as I had a hard time getting into the story.  I felt the first part of the book was redundant going back and forth over the same subject's with our characters not communicating or introducing new information to their situation.  This got old.  But when Kee decides to help Danny relearn vital parts of his life (the names and faces of friends, family etc) and the couple do interact, sparks start to fly and their doomed marriage has a second chance as they rediscover the love both desire but were afraid to fight for the first round.  <br />While this story doesn't have a happy undertone (how can it, both characters have been miserable their entire marriage) there are plenty of situations that add a humor and lightness to the tale as they rediscover the original attraction between them.  I think Kee is well written as a woman in love, but unsure how to proceed since the man she now finds herself married to is so different from the Danny that joined the military.  Because she was beaten down on an emotional level, she had a hard time trusting her judgment because she doesn't want to get hurt anymore.  Danny on the other hand, is bent on keeping her even though his bigger goal is to find out who he is.  I felt he understood her fears that the old Danny could reemerge, but at the same time was at a loss so all he could do was try and be true to himself - which ended up hurting her in a different way.  <br />All in all, this was a good book, but as I mentioned, hard to get into.  Ms. Mallory is a talented author with a creative mind, and I would read another of her stories, so I would recommend this book.	2004-03-24

Her problem - he's interested in her stepsister, the blonde and beautiful Alyssa.  When her father dies, cuts her out of the will and she gets kicked out of her childhood home, Eileen returns to her computer security job to find Daniel Collins, another computer geek hired to help maintain her workload!  Now we mix in the magic.  Mirabella is a Grantor from Wish Makers International that must help Eileen fulfill her wish.  This isn't the make your wish and its granted type of magic though.  So why is it Eileen, who's wish is to have Brock love her, finds herself suddenly so confused?  <br />Poor Eileen, she wants true love, but in order to gain her wish for love, through Wish Makers International, she must complete a seven-step process.  As she is spending so much time with Daniel she discovers his more human side and much to her dismay, Eileen is attracted to him!  While I think a good psychologist would have recommended some of the steps she had to pass to get her wish, the relationship between Eileen and Mirabella was fun and defiantly not clinical!  The budding relationship between Eileen and Daniel was enjoyable to follow especially when Brock takes notice of her.  While you will find yourself wondering what she sees in Brock, I think the way she overcame her childhood fascination was understandable; but can Daniel understand this as well?  <br />While I don't read to many contemporary romances and I think I would have preferred a little more of a paranormal touch, GLASS-SLIPPER-DOT.COM is a modern day Cinderella story and this appealed to me.  With fun secondary characters and an interesting plot, this was a fun story!	2004-03-24

Shannon quickly finds out that she has traded places with the High Priestess Epona who could be her twin in body but not personality.  While the people around her adore Epona, they also fear her for her vicious temper.  Only half recovered from what ever happened to her to transport her to this new place, Shannon finds herself suddenly getting married to a horse (actually a centaur) and it is all she can do to pretend to fill the missing Priestess' shoes!  It isn't until her usually pleasant dreams become nightmares that she finds out they are actually visions, that Shannon finds maybe she really has the strength of a goddess.  With each new vision Shannon and her husband the centaur, ClanFintan find themselves closer and closer to a battle with a formidable enemy.  With the love of her husband, and his people standing with hers they unite the land in a war that will either be their salvation or total annihilation! <br />Ms Cast has written a very powerful novel.  We have reincarnation, centaurs, Muses, magic and a really creepy enemy called the Fomorians.  Where much of the book could be dark, our heroine refuses to let it.  She has such an upbeat personality that makes it hard not to laugh as Shannon constantly has conversations with herself.  She sets out to befriend Epona's &quot;slaves&quot; and later the female centaurs (loved them!) because every woman needs good friends; which is something the real Epona would never have done.  And the people love her for it!  GODDESS BY MISTAKE is written in first person and for most of the book, I didn't even notice.  As for our hero, wow!  ClanFintan is a centaur that has the ability to transform into a human man.  Prior to their marriage, the real Epona had returned all his gifts and he hadfound her unwilling to go through with the promised marriage.  However, to the woman he married he was still a gentleman (gentlecentaur?), and showed every courtesy, so much patience and understanding - this to Shannon who was a completely different woman than he totally expected; remember he thought he was marrying Epona.  While Shannon needed his understanding in order to adjust to her new situation, Shannon falls in love with him.  The scenes between them are so touching.  Rather than the impression of a couple newlywed, it seems that Shannon and ClanFintan have an known each other for a long span of time rather than a couple that just met.  The war for their survival was so well written; I had scenes that were reminiscent of battles from LOTRs running through my head.  While the battle is a poignant moment in the story, the book itself is so much more; it's ...you will just need to read the book.  GODDESS BY MISTAKE was a wonderful story that should appeal to readers of romance, fantasy or mythology. I can't recommend it enough!	2004-03-23

The sequel to UNEARTHED, Ms Barry just gets better and better!<BR>Tru is an intellect that was born and raised in the Majj community that strictly focuses on advancing the galaxy in technologies, medicines and being learned about whatever the genesis's in residence put their minds' to.  The only problem is that in order to stay within the Majj, Tru has to complete a charter before she turns thirty.  Since the age of ten she has worked on only her father's projects never on her own.  With his death she discovers an artifact that she believes is her charter.  One of her hang ups is she needs a guide to help her and who better than Rayce Coburne, a man who excels at acquiring objects - the very name of a man her father had in his records.  Rayce didn't want to accept the job Tru proposed for multiple reasons.  The woman was a Majj, she has no interest in him as a human or even a man, and oh yeah she's a Majj.  However, he desperately needs the credits for the space station he is remodeling or it won't open in time.  So what is supposed to be a quick three day trip to a planet and back to his half renovated station turns into just the beginning when Tru inadvertently blackmails him into helping her finish her charter.  But unlike the Majj society he's heard of, she offers to split the finding 50/50 - after documenting his share of course!  So now the pair travels though hyperspace in a two-person ship with only each other to fight with.  Forced to depend on each other a tentative relationship is formed that blooms into something that could be so much more.  ...Except both know that True will return to the Majj society and how can Rayce compete with her greatest desire?<br />I really loved UNRAVELED.  Tru is so clever and yet so innocent of the universe around her as she's never left the society.  Even though she was emotionally repressed as a woman, I think her reactions were very realistic.  Rayce is used to working alone, and not having problems with women.  So Tru isan enigma for him.  Most of what she does shocks him right to the &quot;bitter&quot; end.  While I had an idea of what Tru might do, the reactions it caused where amazing!  Rayce and Tru both have so many misconceptions about the Majj that when they discover they were wrong about events that have happened in each of their own individual lives, it is amazing the effects on both of them.  But as they say, the truth can only set you free and Rayce is definitely carrying a burden only Tru can free him of! (Cryptic I know, but can't give too much away now can we?)   I loved reading about Elvis, Rayce's dog from Earth, a present from a friend.  I have to say I love reading about animals but mostly the hero or heroine will have cats as a constant companion and having a dog was a nice change.  It brought a whole different set of visuals to mind while reading that were fun and humorous.  Way to go Ms Barry, awesome story and I highly recommend having your senses UNRAVELED with Tru and Rayce!	2004-03-09

Jenna is a Shielder rescued from the Dark Galaxy who now lives on Shimera, a haven from annihilation from the Controllers.  However, she is isolated from her own people by the visions she sees.  So when the Leors demand a bride, or they will not provide passage (only the Leor have ships large enough for transporting a whole colony of people) for two recently discovered Shielder colonies, Jenna steps forward to marry the Leor, which she had seen in a vision.  Arion is a Leor Comdar in firm control of all his emotions.  The matter of taking a mate is only a necessity to propagate their species.  He will not yield to anything, even his non-Leor mate.  However, with the interference of Lani &quot;the blue echo bird&quot; and a meddlesome android, he discovers there could be more at stake than just begetting a child.<br />As a Shielder Jenna knows of the Leor and has heard rumors regarding their lifestyle.  But nothing prepared her for her new life as the mate to a Leor male; for the actuality of trading the isolated security she had on Shimera for his way of life.  Jenna has blindly agreed to live on a hot desert planet where nothing is explained to her.  Life for Jenna is one hardship after the other as the Leors expect her to know their ways, while at the same time they treat her worse than a slave and with mistrust.  Because of Lani, Arion is worried that stress will hinder her ability to conceive a child.  Thus he finds himself getting to know and admire his tiny, fragile, human mate.  Although he is clueless on practically every aspect of dealing with her, the tenderness is still there as well as the growing attraction, which leads to desire.  Thus leaving the big bald guy at a loss because it is contrary to the nature of a Leor.  Arion does make small concessions with Jenna and in their case this more than works.  As the couple faces getting broken apart, can Jenna see her husband not for a beast, but someone she would give her life to protect?<br />This is a really well written novel.  For starters - yippee!! Lani's back!  I love her, she cracks me up and - 'see how the mighty will fall' comes to mind, with her help.  SHADOW FIRES is an intense novel that is a little different.  It seems most weddings are with other humans, where as now we have a human and humanoid marriage.  We get to learn about the Leor, a race of reptilian humanoids that are all in 100% control of everything they do and have a very deep mistrust of outsiders.  <br />The relationship between Jenna and Arion is tender, and I was surprised at how gentle he was with her, even though it went against his own nature.  Jenna is a remarkable woman.  I think if placed in her situation, most people would lack the determination, strength and desire to succeed under the conditions.  At the same time this was also an intense novel.  I loved the android Maxine who helped to lighten the tone almost as much as Lani.  The way the aura is used is ingenious, although embarrassing, also lends moments where you can't help but laugh. If you have read the rest of Ms Spangler's books, you will get to revisit couples from previous stories, including Lani.  I really enjoyed SHADOW FIRES, and couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend it!	2004-02-25

In another world, criminals are given the choice - go to the harsh prison world of Moabar or death. Most chose death. Captain Chasidah Bergren (Chaz) wasn't given the choice. Fighting for her very life she was surprised when an old rival, thought to be dead, boldly rescues her and offers freedom from Moabar in exchange for the personal knowledge she has of the space station she grew up on. <BR>Smuggler Gabriel Ross Sullivan (Sully) is trying to stop an illegal operation that is killing innocent people and could start a war. While the two had come close to becoming lovers, they had always been on opposite sides of the law. With Sully's supposed death and Chaz getting wrongfully accused of a crime she didn't commit, the two are working together to stop something greater than they could even comprehend.  Thus, with their past history, it is natural that love should flair between the two. However Chaz must trust Sully when allies become enemies and enemies become strong allies. Even with the turmoil that she finds herself in, some secrets that Sully hides will come at high prices, and Chaz must trust in the man she is coming to love as she faces everything she fears the most.<br />AWESOME book! The only thing I had a hard time adjusting too was the fact that the book is written in first person meaning you only know Chaz's thoughts, as it is really her story. However, while everything is falling to pieces in her life, you get to find out why the story is in first person, and WOW! Awesome, awesome book. I really liked both our hero and heroine. Even though Chaz has been betrayed by her government that imprisoned her, she isn't a programmed robot and has a sense of humor. Sully is a hero that while seeming to border on having a mild case of schizophrenia (you get to find out why as well) is a very caring individual, and such a remarkable man. His constant companion, a blind Stolorth named Ren - who is only one of the fears that Chaz must overcome, is a very interesting humanoid worthy of his own story! GABRIEL'S GHOST has every thing you could want in a book, whether it is fantasy, science fiction or romance. The book takes off almost at the beginning, and Ms Baker has a wonderful writing ability for misdirection. I am really looking forward to reading more of her books. So take a trip via hyper drive, travel the galaxy and be ready for a novel like no other, as GABRIEL'S GHOST will amaze you too!	2004-02-25

On her way to a special assignment in Iraq, Sergeant Christine Canadys' (CC), plane crashes into the ocean.  Without fully understanding what was happening to her, she changes bodies with a mermaid, Princess Undine.  It is only after she has become a mermaid that CC understands why.  Soon she finds herself swimming from Sarpedon, who is a malevolent merman obsessed with possessing Undine and now CC!  Unsure what to do she calls for Gaea, the mermaids Earth Goddess mother and agrees to become human but having to return to the sea and her mermaid body every third night.  The only way to remain human permanently and away from Sarpedon is to find true love; which turns out to be harder than expected when she meets Dylan a merman.  <br />This was an awesome story.  The beginning of GODDESS OF THE SEA is a little strange as you are watching CC celebrate her birthday all by herself when she decides that women have magic and to release hers by summoning the Earth Goddess Gaea, while intoxicated.  By doing so, she creates a new destiny for herself as a woman.  As a reader you don't get to know what everyone around CC is thinking (for the most part), which helps add to the confusion and fear she is feeling starting with her next day hangover and continuing though the rest of the novel.  Generally following someone's daily events isn't very interesting however, Ms Cast has woven her tale so well, that every detail of her day is an adventure; whether she in a human body on land or Undine's true form of a mermaid.  <br />Living in the 1100's she discovers isn't easy and doesn't like the submissive roll women have, which makes falling in love with Dylan all the more touching.  Dylan is very interesting as well.  He and the real Undine were childhood friends, so he knew almost instantly that CC wasn't Undine.  Because CC is now Undine, I would generally have a problem with this type of relationship (CC being interested in Dylan a friend of Undine who Undine herself was not interested in), CC makes it know up front she isn't the real Undine and while Dylan agrees, it becomes clear while watching the relationship develop that he is in love with CC.  I didn't have to wonder if maybe he is really in love with Undine and sees this as a way to have her.  Besides this, he performs a couple of selfless acts that are so touching (Can't elaborate as it would spoil the surprise!)!  So I really liked him as a hero. When Sarpedon finds her on land, and starts to possess Andras, the knight who has rescued her from the ocean and thinks she is the survivor from a shipwreck, CC realizes that in order to be safe on either land or the sea, she must confront Undines fears.  <br />Ms Cast really knows how to heat up the intimate moments between CC and Dylan.  I was reading this book on an international flight, and wow!  So as a word of warning, while this is a book that will suck you in, it's very steamy.  I loved the last several chapters of the book - especially the end; unfortunately to say much more would give stuff away, SO READ THE BOOK!	2004-02-25

Gillaine Davre' - just Gillie - is a woman of mysteries that newly appointed Admiral of the Fifth Fleet, Rynan Makerian can't fully figure out.  Her ship halfway destroyed, Gillie finds herself deep in space on Cirrus One 352 years in the future; so faking flight codes becomes a necessity as well as keeping a low profile when she discovers that everyone believes she died in the accident that saved their world.  So what did the grateful people do?  The made her a Goddess!  But when things start to happen out in deep space, Gille fears the war she thought ended three hundred years before, might have just been a major set back for the Fav'lhir.  Trying to keep her identity a secret is next to impossible as she falls hard for the hunky Admiral.  But what will happen to her hard fought persona of being 'just Gillie' when her job to protect the Khalar becomes entangled with not being a Goddess?<br />I loved this book!  Gillie wants to be an average girl, hang out in the bars, play pool, drink and have a boyfriend.  But because she is the military advisor for the Khalar and has the important task of saving them from the attacks lead by the Fav'lhir and their planned inhalation, pretty much everyone gives her space and treats her as untouchable.  They can't see beyond the power she wields to the woman she is.  Finding herself 352 years forward in time has its advantages as long as the people on the space station don't find out the Goddess they worship isn't dead after all.  Makerian or Mack is a man set on accomplishing everything set before him.  He has control and the responsibility of converting an old space station into a functioning military facility as well as dealing with a crew that doesn't answer to his leadership, and if that isn't enough has to deal with a shrine that he is getting pressured into building to honor the Goddess Kiasidira. When Gillie shows up his already not functioning so perfect life can only get worse.  Gillie is just the sort of woman he needs.<br />Ms Baker has woven together a wonderful story that will have you laugh one minute and cry the next as you discover what makes the difference between a witch, a sorceress, a mageline and a Kiasidira.  I need to point out that it is because of authors like Ms Baker I love reading paranormals so much.  AN ACCIDNTAL GODDESS is so creative and different.  She writes with wit and charm.  There are so many things I loved about this story.  Gillies' ship, Simon, who is trying from the beginning to set Gillie up with Mack; and then there is Macks' jealousy of the mysterious Simon Gillie keeps talking about.  There are parrots that plague the station (I am going to compare them to mosquitoes - they never go away!).  And Gillie trying to deal with the fact she is a Goddess - with a raunchy consort she is constantly thwarting (just so there isn't any confusion, this isn't Mack!)!  Excellent book, I can't recommend it enough!	2004-02-20

Artificial Intelligence - AI.  Ever saved a document and forgotten the title?  Imagine this on a grander scale... Vic has created and saved her AI program on her work computer at Vismorph because it has the space and speed required to both build and run her AI program she has named Jodie.  Only now she has been fired, and has to save Jodie from getting altered or worse exploited.  At the same time Jodie is shuffling around its primary computer components and creating a firewall around the original program in the Vismorph mainframe trying to keep Vic's ex-boss out; while Jodie doesn't understand emotions really it wants a body to be human.  Vic only wants to protect her program so after jumping from a burner why not jump into a fire?  Because there is no tuning back and if they don't do something quickly, Vic might loose her precious program.  Jodie may be a program, but because Vic has designed Jodie to be &quot;perfect&quot; she finds herself attracted to Jodie on all levels.<br />I will admit I was skeptical. I picked this book up because I was curious how a program could gain life and Ms Squires has created a phenomenal science fiction romance in BODY ELECTRIC.  Vic is a lonely, very single computer driven woman who dresses like a man to compete in a male dominated field.  When she lets herself be a woman, it is in a disguise and because she has to be in control generally gets hurt.  Jodie was supposed to be the woman she wasn't minus the emotional hang-ups, but Jodie decided that rather than being female, the program was male.  I loved the way Jodie just took off and grew, but regarding AI, I would have been disappointed in anything else.  Reading how Vic was having a hard time fathoming the knowledge Jodie obtained so quickly was funny!  Vic also ended up reuniting with her estranged brother because of Jodie, and I hope it is a permanent mend.  BODY ELECTRIC seems so cutting edge withcomputer lingo (that I don't understand but doesn't detract from the story to much), especially where Vic is trying to finish her AI program and then again with the whole idea of Jodie trying to gain a human body.  I can only imagine this it is from research and ingenuity.  The story line is action packed and I wasn't able to put the book down.  If you are looking for something different, this is a must read!	2004-02-20

Blind only while deciding how to serve justice she is terrified by Zareks \\"spit in your face\\" attitude. However, while his words are gruff his actions speak differently and so she struggles to figure out what Asheron sees in him that would deem him innocent. <br />DANCE WITH THE DEVIL is the long awaited (and wondered) about story of Zarek, the slave become Dark Hunter that killed the village of people he was sworn to protect and was therefore banished to the harsh wilderness of Alaska almost a millennium before. Although this story, I think, is more intense than the previous installments, I would have been disappointed had it been anything less. I was amazed that the intensity Zarek portrayed in NIGHT EMBRACE wasn't lost within the pages of his story. Somehow, buried deep within Zarek is a true hero that has given up on himself even as he fights to protect the lives of others. Astrid is a heroine unlike any other that will have your jaw dropping as she sorts thru two thousand years of gruesome history to pass judgment. And as always, Ms Kenyon has woven her lighted hearted humor with the newest cast members added to the Dark Hunter world as well as one we all love to hate. So, in true Dark Hunter fashion, be prepared for another heart-stopping page-turner from Ms Kenyon with an astonishing ending! <br />To those of you who have never read a Dark Hunter novel, this is an excellent novel and yes you could read it as a stand alone book, but if you went back to read the other stories, you will spoil some of the endings for yourself.	2003-11-17

As the daughter to the Lord of the keep she has promised to marry another when she meets the man of her dreams - seriously injured, and unable to remember his own name, she names him Adrian and takes home to heal.<BR>The Dragon: Seriously injured, Adrian doesn't remember anything about himself.  The only thing he is certain of is that the red headed witch caring for him is his mate.<BR>The Sorcerer: In human form masquerading as a priest to Tempest's betrothed, Sardon is surprised when he discovers the man in her care is none other than the last of the Golden Dragons, whom he thought he had destroyed. <br />I think Ms Lein has done a wonderful job with this thoroughly engaging story.  I was hooked from the beginning and by the end of the book there was no way I could put it down (and expect to sleep) without finishing it.  I thought the secondary characters were well written and added a layered effect with the different plots.  You fall in love with her half-brother, love her nurse, hate her mother (harsh I know) and are shocked with the trickery Sardon performs to get what he wants.  (He is a bad guy you will love to boo!)  My only real complaint is that this book has excessive punctuation errors that became confusing at times.  There is also narration during the story that at points seems forced and choppy.  However this is an awesome dragon tale and I would recommend it in a heartbeat.	2003-11-08
US	24853483	R11OARUCGQ5FKI	1590803132	994284851	Highland Honor	Books	5	3	4	N	N	To marry &amp; not fall in love, what a suggestion!	Sometimes, for the greater good, bitter enemies will fight together against a common enemy.  In this case the Campbells and the MacGregors against Dougal Campbell who is returning to the Highlands with a raised army to again try and take over the title of Laird of the Campbells.  To join forces against the man who killed his father years ago, Gavin MacGregor hand-fasts with Hannah Campbell for a year and a day (or until the end of the threat), and secretly agrees to not consummate the union so at the end of the allotted time, he can return her to her brother Owen the Laird of the Campbells.  Hannah goes into her marriage with her own set of secrets regarding the events that took place ten years ago as well.  Determined to make her marriage work, Hannah struggles with the fact that Gavin doesn't remember her.  United against a common enemy the Clans fight together, but it is an unknown enemy that has the ability to tear them apart.  <br />For her first novel Ms Pepio wove together a fabulous love story set in the Scottish Highlands during the 1100's.  With well rounded characters and unexpected twists Hannah will amaze you with her ability to trust and love, while poor Gavin doesn't stand a chance of keeping his word not to touch her.  Both are strong willed and while honor maybe everything, love is worth fighting for.  As part of a historical, something almost always happens to the heroine, where the hero must come to the rescue--this scene was so unique!  I thought this book was slightly reminiscent of Julie Garwood's Scottish romances.  HIGHLAND HONOR is an excellent novel that will touch your heart- a definite keeper and author to keep your eye on!	2003-11-08

Except, every time she is in his company he treats her as a Lady, even if he is out to seduce her!  For Jack, women are only good for loving and leaving, hence the title Master of Seduction.  However, every time he has a verbal sparing match with the enchanting Lorelei he finds himself more entangled in a web he doesn't understand.  <br />From tantalizing art work to a ship wreck (as only one near death experience), MASTER OF SEDUCTION will enthrall anyone looking for a good story and provide many opportunies to laugh.  Oh and when I mention art work, I should add, Lorelei's version of painting fruit... it is the best!  I can say no more!  As I really enjoyed Jack and Lorelei's story, I highly recommend this book.	2003-11-06

Instead of the clean get a way she hopes for, her just paid off ship explodes before her very eyes.  The ship she hijacks to escape turns out to be possessed by a computer that thinks it's alive.  Nicoli Romanof doesn't want to rely on the child pilot that in several daring moves launched his ship.  However in the middle of a top secret mission to bring down the Harvestors, he must rely on &quot;Michaels&quot; (the name Angel gives Nicoli), to aide him in regaining his body from  the Harvestors - a species that kidnaps people and sells the bodies on the black market.  When the recovery mission fails to go as expected, the pair are forced to work together as they fight for their very survival.  Angel must return to her own past and face her worst fears while Nicoli must discover that while women can be feminine, not every woman wishes to be protected from experiencing life.<br />A very fast paced space adventure, TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN is the ultimate game of cat and mouse.  Facing both known and unknown enemies Nicoli and Angel really can only trust each other.  The worlds created are something right out of the movies and the tension between characters will leave you wondering 'who is the bad guy?' until the surprising conclusion!  I loved the humor woven into some of the scenes as well.  This was such a different story and so refreshing.  I would highly recommend this book as an excellent space adventure with a heroine with more guts than brawn and a hero larger than life.	2003-11-06

Shadow in Starlight follows the standard romance theme: man meets woman, they fall in love, something happens to tear them apart and then they get back together. However, what makes this novel so special are the characters themselves. Set in the Middle Ages of a mythological world where dragons still fly and wizards do roam, Moreya Fa travels as an unwilling royal bride to a neighboring country as a weapon to annihilate the family of her future husband. You see, when ever she is outside, she calls the dragons within the vicinity, who kill everyone around her and carry her off to their caves. Our hero, Preece the Warmonger thinks himself immune to the beautiful woman he is escorting through treacherous borders to her fiancé. An outcast, that hires out his sword to save money to go to Atarxia, an island where he wouldn't have to live with constant scorn, he doesn't understand how Moreya could see the person he is behind the dark cowl he hides behind. However, when they are attacked, and the dragons come, somehow after rescuing Moreya, she pleads with him to take her to his Island sanctuary. Unable to deny the beauty her request for assistance, Preece takes her as both his wife and life mate, but before they are able to flee the continent, they are betrayed. When each of them tries to save the other, the new lovers are torn apart when Moreya is prevented from escaping with the dragons.<br />SHADOW IN STARLIGHT is a very fast paced magical journey with many twists. Both our characters are well developed. Although there are few descriptive details, somehow the world itself is alive and creates a visual masterpiece that stands out with exceptional clarity. With unique ideas, the romance is heartbreaking and achingly sweet. This is a real page-turner that will keep you enthralled till the happy end!  I am greatly looking forward to future books by Ms Biondine!	2003-11-06

What happens when you mix four Dark Hunters (that for the most part hate each other), three wanna be Gods (that are trying to release the Destroyer), and several packs of Were-Hunters?  Mardi Gras!  In the process of kicking Daimon rear lon gets run over by a runaway float and taken home with Sunshine Runningwolf, an artist that doesn't believe in coffee and eats soy cheese.  Wanting nothing more than to keep her safe and call her his own Talon can't, fearing a curse set on him by an ancient Celtic God:  any mortal that gets close to him (including a squire) will die.  Sunshine understands that Talon only wants a one-day stand, and yet the \\"Not Exactly a Vampire\\" man seems to keep coming back.  Which makes it all the harder, because she knows she'll have to let him go.  Then the more time she spends with him, the more she starts having all these past life dreams about herself and a Talon that hasn't really changed.  <br />In true Kenyon form, NIGHT EMBRACE is full of jaw dropping hysterical one-liners.  I'm amazed each of the characters has such a huge difference in personality.  While I'm trying not to give anything away, with this story the world expands as each character brings their own form of chaos to New Orleans regardless of the reasons they are present.  And while this is Talon and Sunshine's story, each \\"bad-boy\\" introduced will leave you yearning to hear their tale.  This is another hit from Sherrilyn Kenyon.  If you haven't read any of the previous Dark Hunter novels, Sherrilyn has a fabulous off beat sense of humor, with guys that sleep all day and play all night (and kick Daimon rearYou can't miss NIGHT EMBRACE as the Dark Hunter saga continues.	2003-11-01

Sammie didn't need rescuing she had scared her fiancé off!  So being the gentleman he was, he retuned her home.  Wanting to make sure the consequences of the Bride Thief's actions weren't disastrous for Sammie, Eric Landsdowne, Earl of Wesley attends a soirée held in her honor where he suddenly discovers that Sammie is more than a Miss he can just forget.  For Sammie having decided she never wanted to marry because no doubt her husband would demand she stop her scientific research, doesn't know what to do with the Earl.  While physically attracted to him, how could she have a relationship with a man bent on capturing the Bride Thief?  <br />A happy story every reader of historical romance would enjoy; where the heroine refuses to bend to society and her match making mama.  Although a very enjoyable read, you know the causes as to why our hero became the Bride Thief.  This added humor to Sammies predicament as well as making Eric's story more poignant, but also made the story a little predictable.  However Ms. D'alessandro has the wonderful ability to tell a story so I would recommend this book.	2003-11-01

Our heroine, Lady Adriana St. Ives is a fallen woman. Five years ago, when her lover cast her aside and publicly denounced her, Adrianan's two brothers fought in a duel for her honor. Having killed the bastard son of the Prince, Julian and Gabriel fled the country to save their own lives. Only when she marries Tynan Spenser, an Irish Earl, do they return to try and save her once again. Arriving too late to prevent the wedding, Julian is incarcerated on the charges of murder. Fascinated by the woman he now calls his wife Tynan vows to help free her brother in exchange for her assistance in aiding him to gain a much coveted seat in the English House of Commons. Finding her a reserved but passionate creature he also vows to win her heart with one kiss a day for a hundred days. With so much at stake, Adrianan finds herself fighting her own womanly urges as her new husband has sworn to reawaken the passion she sees as her fatal flaw. Facing society after five years reawakes her old scandal, and as our couple deals with the animosity she must face for both her brother and to regain her own dignity, as a reader we watch her grow from a wallflower back into the raving beauty that she has hidden so well. But before Tynan and Adrianan can live happily ever after, the secret he guards with his own life must come out. <br />Ms. Samuel's has written an excellent story about love and fighting for what you believe in. Adrianan is a refreshing character for two reasons: she isn't a virgin when she marries and she actually is fighting against her own passion, and because she is facing her own faults (to grow back into a self reliant woman that she should be) caused by of the pain of her scandal rather than already being a strong female heroine. While sometimes there seems to be too much focus on Jilian, he is the main reason for her self-discovery into the womanAdrianan wants to be. ...After thinking about this book, I think I was expecting something light hearted and funny. Instead \\"The Black Angel\\" is a novel dealing with powerful emotions. Humor is a key ingredient that keeps the novel from getting to intense or our characters dull and depressing. So I enjoyed this book.	2003-11-01

Passing through Ramsgil and playing the part of a tourist, Adam Warrick, the new Earl of Spenceworth finds himself the selected \\"buyer\\" of Jocelyn Tanner the \\"wife\\" up for auction.  When he tosses the coin, and the \\"husband\\" catches it clumsily causing his purchased \\"wife\\" to get knocked unconscious, Adam feels obligated to take her to Spenceworth manor to make sure she doesn't suffer from a concussion.<br />Returning to her childhood home should have been a relief.  However nothing is as it seems for Nelwina.  Wanting to stay at Spenceworth, she dives into her new life as she tries to help restore Spenceworth to its previous grandeur.  Adam, dealing with a run down estate that sadly lacks finances has little time for romance, then, when his mother unexpectedly shows up and takes his patient under wing, is grateful to have Jocelyn Tanner to keep her occupied.  However, every time Jocelyn insists her name really is Nelwina Honeycutt, Adam chooses to continually rack it up to her head injury. But he has a hard time explaining the fact that knows more about Spenceworth manor and gardens than any other soul.  For Nelwina, living two-hundred years in the future wasn't what she had expected, nor acquiring another woman's body.  The only problem is, how can she adapt to this life and keep from falling in love with Adam, knowing that the real Jocelyn is trapped in the past?  Yet how could she leave the love she always yearned for?<br />The long awaited sequel to SixPence Bride, Virginia Farmer weaves the charming tale of Nelwina Honeycutt.  Some of the descriptions (for example of the loo) were humorous and I thought clever.  With the changing of bodies between Jocelyn Tanner and Nelwina Honeycutt, this time travel is unique.  Not only does Nelwina need to deal withlearning new technologies totally foreign to her, she must come to terms with another woman's life.  So join Adam and Nelwina on their bumpy little ride as they fall in love.  Spenceworth Bride is a delightful tale.	2003-10-31
