How oft we dream to reach our goals and get what we want? It's the determination to Grow Rich - Get what you want and make up your mind till you succeed. The theme of this book is absolutely tempting and convincing to believe and after reading the book, it really boost up ego and motivates to grow in riches and succeed. By riches, do we mean just money? I guess not. Because this book is all about building up your own self esteem and living up to your desires till opportunity strikes your door and welcomes you. Napolean Hill in his book has set an example of the Edison Dictating Machine and Barnes took the opportunity to talk to Edison and  suggested him that he can sell the product when Edison's salesmen were not enthu to sell it. Thus, Barnes became a business associate and proved he can 'Think and grow rich'. Thus, with yet more examples, the book gives an insight to use mind power and use the sixth senses and be persistent and determined until you get what you want. However, sometimes it's growing Rich in many areas and missed out is 'money power' which the author says to believe in self and things you can do. Success is ever personal and whatever you define it, you grow Rich - rich in thoughts, rich in awareness, in accumulating wealth, knowledge, etc. A good book for self betterment and feeling on high spirits. Good pick.	2005-09-09

Another author Paul Coelho comes to my mind apart from Harold Kushner,Deepak Chopra, Robin Sharma, Osho,etc whose book collection I cherish the most. However, Robert Schuller's books are great guiding light and stand a class apart in spiritual training. Robert schuller speaks the wisdom of living - Motivating, Inspiring and changing Attitudes for a better Positive living lifestyle. This book of RS reflects the most positive flow of thinking 'Be what you are, what god what you to be'. Rob shares his wisdom and power of positive thinking to be optimistic. With great personal stories and anecdotes, likewise his other books, this one has a fine line down the read that speaks of wise advice 'Don't throw away tomorrow - Live the dreams'.

I've read all his books and they are best in my library. I also make it a point to gift to the people I like and feel I wish to share Rob's wisdom.

Instinctive decision and I placed the book back on the rack when I first picked up at a local bookstore. However, again some hidden instincts made me read the book. The cover page ain't impressive and its a snap judgement, maybe. In a Blink, the decision is instinctive - That's what the Book speaks about. The best selling author of 'Tipping Point', Gladwell reveals psychological facts on behavior patterns of people. Gladwell builds his cases that are supportively influential to a reader and makes him think small and focus on the meaning of \\"thin slices\\" of behavior. He has case studies on car selling, heart attack, etc. which explains his concept of thin slices - upon the information, derive to decisions. However, I feel that often the judgements may wry wrong with the decisions if its only based on information. The sixth sense or intuition plays an important role in thought manipulation. Snap judgements turn people off-track in decision making sometimes but in a blink, first decisions do turn the other way round. Experts in the field have proven decision and are correct in their presumptions. However, Gladwell's case studies is indepth as to pros and cons on accuracy and how one can go about 'Blink' - snap judgements. The book is fine as long as you like to ponder over. The fact remains - your own snap judgements or the intution, the sixth sense always helps you to make decisions! Fine read.	2005-08-25

'Whale Done' has life techniques to master with wise advice from the author of 'One Minute Manager'. Appreciate or rathar call 'Praise everyone' with motivation and inspiration is an essential tip of the book. The skills of a five ton killer whale trainer has effective results at work place and home. The trainers are responsible for the most feared predators in the ocean, to perform amazing acrobatic leaps and dives.They build the trust, show care and warmth and 'Whale Done' - Make the positive, impossible of impossible and catching doing the thing right.The same logic applies to humans surrounding to catch them doing wrong and making them doing the right - to be better parents, better spouses, better managers, whatever. The businessman of the book Wes Kingley discusses with the whale trainers who reveal the secrets who have a whale way out and this is the unique theme using whale techniques setting up discipline and praising with 'Whale Done...Keep it up' or rathar motivate, inspire, encourage and activate - I would say, humans are much easier to get trained than these Whales through the Ken Blanchard techniques. Ignoring never works when catching not doing the right thing but redirection always bring forth the positive results. This rule applies for kids too and as parents, they can guide the kids by not saying 'Don't do' but redirecting with love and warmth. A very easy, quick read book that builds positive relationships.

As a kid, we had this book on our Literature List and every time we had to write down the answers of Literature tales, it was rather strenuous and boring as this meant to be a part of education. However, when it came to conduct a teaching class in literature, Great Expectation turned out to be an adventure. Unlike Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Pip is not really a hero and also it does not end a Happy ending but Pip is being stripped of his wealth and his position in society. Pip is sent to London to be educated as a gentleman, he is impressed by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. He neglects and abandons the honest, hardworking folk who care for him and his pride is hurt when he learns who his mysterious benefactor is. Pip express guilt for his behavior who have a violent nature and crude ways but altogether he is courageous too. Pip, his father surname being Pirrip and his Christian name Philip, that's how he is called `Pip' , has a fascination for Estella but is brought up by Miss Havisham to wreck revenge on all male sex and break hearts. Herbert Pocket is a character who has frankness was amiable and cheerful who became a friend of Pip. Dicken's novels have a central theme `rags-to-riches' tale of a poor, underprivileged boy who is finally accepted into society. Strangely, this one has a different end.

Even in US top flight uni graduates turned up their noses at business jobs and tried instead into government job service or uni teaching. Today grandmoms give latest business seller instead of Bible to their grand sons at high school graduation ceremony. The pastor who considers himself as anti business of evangelical church, is as conversant with cash flow analysis as any accountant and runs it off routinely on his personal computer. He even attends management seminars to learn how to maintain `spiritual entrepreneurship' as the chief executive officer of his fast growing congregation. 35 years ago Business was widely viewed as an anachronism to be engulfed everywhere in a rising socialist tide. An indepth study of the Author highlights the facts of past, present and future. In the chapter of Politics, the author reveals the fact that political changes has been drastic in American Politics since the period 1965-1973, as a decade passes to enter `the next century'<br /><br />He thinks that after 300 or more years in which weapons were productive and worked as instruments of policy, they have become counterproductive.He reminds of Mark Hanna's America, where farmers were half the population. The business interest which Mark Hanna mobilized for political power was not General Motors or Citibank, he says. The concept was total different.As regards Education,Peter Drucker feels that there should be serious discussion of the social purpose and responsibility of education in the new reality of the knowledge society. He details few requirements as Education fuels economy and shapes society which is a factor to be remembered.

Satirical and barbed, a distinguished read by the New York Observer columnist and author of several books. Hoax stands out to be a controversial pick as the Author hits on the Bush Administration for its diversionary tactics for invading Iraq.<br /><br />He begins his book with a quote from former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser: \\"The genius of you Americans is that you never make clear-cut stupid moves, only complicated stupid moves.\\" The Author's son is currently in Iraq in the United States Army to whom the book is dedicated. Due to his temper tantrums, the author was fired many times by editors and TV Executives and he even lost the Pulitzer prize. Hoax is the hot stepper in the best selling list of post Iraq War Books. Von Hoffman criticizes the Bush Administration and this may hurt the blind patriotic faith of Americans who believes that its government does little wrong than many others. In the beginning chapter `The Big Lie' Von Hoffman speaks of the super rich and power image of America and reveals how the American people have been gulled into cheering for a gigantic hoax by the Bush administration. \\"It happened because America has manufactured its own reality. A dome has slipped over the country, turning the nation into a unique biosphere, which causes Americans to see, hear, and interpret every event and each happenstance as no other people do. Poisoned by recycled, un-refreshed air, Americans think differently.\\" The Bush Administration invaded Iraq with the terrorism threat hanging on as the world watched over with make belief feel that Saddam is the present `Hitler' and Osama Bin Laden lured in the oblivion. Von Hoffman confirms Saddam as the butcher of Baghdad and was a ruthless dictator responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iranians, during the Iran-Iraq war, Kurds, and the random butchering of Iraqis whom he suspected as enemies of the Baath regime. Von Hoffman says that America's mission to curb the Islamic world and bring terrorism to its knees has proven unsuccessful inspite of its so-called victories over Afghanistan and Iraq. The US Government reputation shatters in the eyes of International community and even Tony Blair, the British PM's political future hangs in the balance. Von Hoffman says, \\"US coalition is busy converting Iraq into a \\"free world, \\"Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda still remain at large\\" and this is so very true and raise questions to Bush Administration. American vision gets blurred as citizens get trapped into white lies and belief `We are right, you are wrong'.  A saying goes `you can fool some people some time but you can't fool all people all the time' and perfectly this applies to Bush Administration and the US. Blunt, bold and outspoken, Von Hoffman the Author/journalist is well informed and has presented a Book that sure is a great Pick and if you have been reading M.J.Akbar's Bylines, you will definitely find similar thoughts to many topics covered up in the Hoax.<br /><br />-ilaxierrorism to its knees has proven unsuccessful inspite of its so-called victories over Afghanistan and Iraq.

Neale Donald Walsch has a way showing his readers how to be communicate with the ultimate super power 'God' and develop a friendly relation, irrelevant of the fact whether you can see him, meet him or not! Neale's dialogue with god fetches him back the answers that he could not visualize and foresee. The secret lies in talking, simple plain questions like:<br /><br />Q. God please be here. We need help.<br /><br />A. I am here<br /><br />Q. We need help<br /><br />A. I know<br /><br />Q. Right Now<br /><br />A. I understand<br /><br />Q. The world is on brink of disaster and I'm not talking about natural disaster but about man made calamity.<br /><br />A. I know. And you're right. You understand the severity of the problem. you simply do not understand the nature of the problem. You do now know what is causing it. So you keep trying to solve it at every level except the level at which it exists.<br /><br />Q. Which is?<br /><br />A.The problem facing the world today is spiritual problem....<br /><br />And the conversations goes on...The message of all the sacred scriptures is the same. What is different is how humans have interpreted them, says Neale. The argument about what Quran says, Bible says, veda says, what Bhagwad Gita says is mind set thoughts of human brains. It is who you believe in that concerns most. I guess the message of Neale Donald Walsch's Conversation with god is all about communion with God, enlightening oneself and doing what is right. It is a step to break free from illusions and bring god in our everyday life to inspire, encourage and build within the courage to face the bare facts of life. A nice read with deep meanings to digest. Good Pick.	2004-09-10

Raving Fans of Ken Blanchard love to read all his Books coz of his Innovative ideas and writing skills. I love all Ken's Reads and this one is no exception as it has all inspirational, encouraging, innovative and satisfying techniques to build better Customer Relationships. This book has proven techniques as it covers on 'After-service' facilities too and for a Corporate Insurance Executive & Advisor like me, I feel people sort for not only Service but also 'After sales Service' which builds a strong rapport with the customer and a long term, beneficial relationship, floating in more references therein. I heard a Doctor who had his Sonography Machines worth more than a 50 lacs insured but could not get the claim inspite of paying premiums only because the Company had waved off old machines and the new hubs cost him grand. The customer service is failed by Agent due to Govt. Insurance companies and in such cases, I guess it is worth a deal to strike with new better Insurance companies with affiliations. Hence, Ken's book is all about effective system and playing role as serving with style to create revolution at workplace and fetch in good business. Every Executive should read and follow Ken Blanchard's techniques and remember that Customers are not Satisfied anymore but require 'Service' and that is most important. Experiences leads to perfection with practical tips of Ken. A good pick.	2004-08-02

Mind as psychology, mind as emotion, mind as mind/body; mind as moralist, mind as belief; mind as religion, mind as history, mind as politics and social evolution -- all examined, studied, and integrated.

He exposed hypocrisy and humbug wherever he saw and this Autobiography is like a thorough journal of the most controversial and dynamic personality `Osho' who is said to have been `Never Born, Never Died' by all his followers.

New York Times in a front page review Sunday, panned Clinton's 957 page book as 'sloppy, self indulgent and often eye crossingly dull'.

Wonderful pics with Bill's childhood emotions and failures of his life revealed in a vivid manner. His extraordinary spirits and hard work serving the people is seen through the pages as he narrates various incidents of his life. A very determined global leader, I think the Book is a total revealing biography and for International readers, definitely make an interesting read. It is more a sort of Marketing Gimmicks that has clicked 'My Life' to fame as well as critics shoot up their comments negative too. However,As Fans of Bill Clinton read his Autobiography 'My Life' - there releases the Autobiography of the Life of an Indian Prime Minister. 'Manmohanomics: Journey to South Block, Life of an Indian Prime Minister' By Vivek Garg and Ravish Mishra. The book is published by Manas Publication priced at Rs.495/-(256 pages).

The Author Michael Baigent et al has all made the attempts to Challenge Faith of Christianity with the theme of the Book, portraying Jesus as not Crucified but lived to marry and bear children whose bloodline continues! A sheer mystery exploration of the Authors with twists of historical facts. At a time when 'Passion of Christ' of Mel Gibson says all about the last twelve hours suffering of Christ, here comes a controversial read challenging even the traditional accepted facts. Jesus Christ did not die on Cross? The very thought is visionary with the most provocative, researched, convincing theory in the 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail', leaves one baffled even to a non christian. It's like reading a Detective, Thriller - an illusionary tale yet making it an interesting read as one wonders : Is this true?

Almost all stories of Grimm have moral values and this one is no exception. Fairy tales were told as form of entertainment too. They show the kids the right way to behave. However, If pondered over, Hansel and Gretel is one fairy tale with Biblical resemblance. The kids view their parents house as a place of security.The two children are wandering through the woods and are hungry, tired and alone.  This closely resembles the passage where Jesus wandered through the desert for forty days.  He too was tired and hungry and completely alone.  During this time, Satan tried to tempt Jesus with food.  Satan told Him that if He were the Son of God, then He should turn a stone into bread for food (Luke 4:3).  Jesus did not get tempted but here in the story, the children saw the gingerbread house and ate parts of it until they were full. The children continued to eat pieces of it even after they were full, which is gluttony. And Gluttony is one topic in Bible is seen as one of the seven deadly sins, if I am not mistaken. Than the final part, Gretel traps the witch inside her own oven, right before she was getting ready to cook Hansel.  The witch is burnt up.  This resembles the story of Satan.  At the end of Satan's reign over earth, the Christians will be saved from the fire and Satan will be thrown into the fiery pit of Hell, where he will be tortured forever. In end, there is rejoicing; very similiar when the satan (witch) dies,the children reap the rewards and rejoice to 'live happily ever after' Moreover, the tale show abandonment, hunger, fear,friendly sibling example, family unity - issues that startles kids minds to pause and think. It makes the kids dive into imagination and with the very good illustrations and very well re-told classic, this book is a wonderful Pick for all Children - Best of the Best Fairy tale to read and instil moral values in kids.	2004-05-24

Books	4	6	6	N	N	Negotiating to Winning Edge	Everything's Nice about this Book as it teaches to Negotiate leading to be a winner. The Power of Nice works striking, suggestive ways to deal and negotiate the power skills of Negotiating in supportive mutual environment. The books by Ronald Shapiro and Mark has proven methods of Give n Take Dealing in business and offers a helpful guide for negotiations. The three Ps - Preparing, probing and proposing are the three factors detailed by the authors that prepares for the deal, probing i.e. what they want and is required to deliver and proposing is the stage when the deal fixes towards winning edge with the negotiating skills.The Book reveals observations and anecdotes with very good illustrations. John F. Kennedy's quote on &quot;Let us never fear to negotiate. But let us never Negotiate out of fear&quot; in the Negotiating chapter reveals that some people want to eat the whole cake! They fail in negotiations and refrain from being fair enough. They would raise ample questions in self interest like 'Why take a share of profit when I can take it all' Why can't I keep all commissions?' Why offer concessions?' Why negotiate when you can dictate?' and thus, the difficult Negotiater loses a second deal in future. Moreover, the authors teach negotiaters to be more Confident and possess knowledge which is power. When a person helps the other side to get what they want, automatically both the parties reach for a win win situation. The negotiating strategy here in this book gears for Niceness, the attitude to let others get what he wants in a deal and gain while in turn, the negotiater succeeds in dealing with the customer. In sectors like Insurance Business, I think 'Convincing' is also another part which the authors might have considered elaborating. However, A good book and a nice handy Guide for all people who want to reach out to their customers and strike the Deal.	2004-05-21

This book has been a valuable gift to me long ago that made me inquisite to know about World Religions. It is always said 'Avoid 3 P's - Priest, Politician and Press' if you wish the world to be in peace. Leaving this debate, I feel this book is a great reference to understand the main World Religions. Religion is a faith that is observed by a mass of people in their own special way.In their religious goals, men do not differ from one another, no matter where they live and when. All seek favour and protection against dangers of life. They pray for courage in hour of conflict, comfort in time of grief, guidance in daily concerns. They release pangs of conscience. Six great Religions:Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese, Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Some have similarities but all six obviously have supplied answers to some of the great questions raised in every human mind by the mystery of life. All of them help men to bear their sorrows. They all tell men how to live, give assurance in the presence of death. Every Religion has noble teachings and lofty moral goals and this book provides very good information on all religions. The author has taken Hindu as first chapter but that doesn't mean he's been partial to christianity or any other religion coz I found the details in this book chapterwise/religionwise, informative with illustrated pictures and religious myths and facts. A good pick and gem collection on shelf.	2004-02-20

His arguments are quite unique esp. the Love chapter is all a 'ga-ga emotional swings' The powerful emotions override circumstances with ease and a glad heart is resourceful in finding joys! Mind itself is a 'Thought Factory' and it can make a heaven or hell out of it. The author digs into psychology - neuroscience effects and how the senses perform. With indepth views, the book might seem misleading at places but to sum up, the authors leaves room for the'free' flow of thoughts. Signs of anxiety, fear, insecurity is emotional outbursts seen in some people which is totally controlled by the thinking process of the brain. Hearing, speaking, thinking are all mind triggered emotions and even memories relate to Mindful thoughts. The book is a good read on Mind functioning and if one is interested in Psychology reads, this is good Pick!	2004-02-12

People who adopt TQM (Total Quality Management) which is about constantly improving every process and product by progressive methods motivate with the Change and quip for empowerment at workplace. If there isn't Motivation, however well you want TQM, it fails as psychologically needs is not fulfilled. Self esteem is hurt too.

Apart from this, I possess Everyman's Encyclopedia, Hamlyn's Children Encyclopedia, Groliers & Microsoft Encarta CDs, Brittanica Encylopedia, Collier's two Books, Oxford and a couple of kids encylopedias. These are oceans of knowledge and great storehouse of information. Each have their own peculiarities and each encyclopedia for me is a prize collection when it comes to finding on specific topics and comparisons. For example, the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's info is missed out in World book but too informative in Microsoft Encarta. Whereas, World Book presents very good History and biography sections. Encarta has good sports, music and arts, etc section that I found interesting. Oxford and Collier's is quick easy glance for readers. Hamlyn's best for kids reference. I guess for people who are into research, students using for projects etc. should go for World Book Encylopedia, secondly sort for Microsoft Encarta CD - Rest all is ocean of knowledge, Enjoy!	2003-11-20

Authors Adele Faber & Elaine Mazlish has published books like Siblings Without Rivalry & How to Talk so kids will Listen & Listen so kids will Talk. However, my in-depth study on the psychology of childrens' minds reveal the facts that their attitudes are solely dependent on their circumstances and their upbringing levels at home & school. It's one thing sure any kid require is 'Love, patience & Self Esteem.'<br />Psychologists caution against casting children in specific roles: the quiet one, athletic one, smart one, clumsy one and even a negative type can provide harmful self image that a child may carry throughout his life. Sibling rivalry is a competition for the affection and attention of their parents. Two best known Bible stories deal with bitter feuds between brothers-The Cain and Abel and the rivalry of Joseph and hisbrothers.Even in fairy tales - in 112 of the Grimm's' fairy tales, it is found that the youngest child came out a winner in battles with everything from evil gnomes to jealous siblings 92 percent of the times.<br />Psychologists authors of `Siblings without Rivalry' suggest that instead of thinking of equality in everything from parental attention to music lessons, parents should be sensitive to each child's individual needs.Self esteem of a child plays a major role. Comparisons should be avoided as each child is born with a difference. The authors have very valuable tips telling parents to adopt various methods and outcome with cartoons illustrating key points. The book reflects on the inner instincts of kids like jealousy and selfishness. Parents need to be aware of their attitude which become homegrown sibling rivalry. Communication is also important part that a parent miss out and impatiently tackles the sibling rivalry which only worsens things. Demonstrating love is very important and telling the child that he is so special. \\"I enjoy your friendship' or `I can always count on your support' or `You make me feents with + 2 & above kids.	2003-07-31

The Philosophy of Ayn Rand is a logic, which has a major impact on the intellectual side. This book is a collection of essays appeared in The Objectivist Newsletter, edited and published by Ayn Rand and Nathaniel Branden, The issues that crop up day-to-day and the problems that arise were sorted by with every chapter. Selfish itself is regarded as `evil' word but Ayn Rand's philosophy regards Objectivist Ethics as a morality of rational self interest. An industrialist who produces a fortune and a gangster who robs a bank are regarded as equally immoral since they both sought wealth for their own selfish benefit. Since nature does not provide man with an automatic form of survival, since he has to support his life by his own effort, he would have to work in self-interest and this is not selfish means. It's like self-supporting with some moral codes and purpose of morality is to define man's proper values and interests and man must be beneficiary of his own moral actions. The Book is a high read and thought provoking. Reviewing is rather brief and so, if one is fond of philosophy, here is a good Choice Read - Ayn Rand's Best New concept of egoism with inputs by NB.	2003-04-01

The lowly mechanic of Indiana steel mills dares to fall in luv with Meredith, only offspring of President of Bancroft &amp; co.As JM grips with the story, Meredith suffers a miscarriage and anger of her dad. Meredith is forced to face Matt and there is tension, suspicion and all those bitter memories on fore. With so much drama in the novel, JM glues to make you read the plots interestingly. No wonder, the climax of the book is always a happy ending but its the expressive emotional outpours which spur emotions. After eleven years, JM brings Matt &amp; Meredith meet to decide their fate making marvellous reading and amazingly good pick on a nice summer day. JM books are always the best romance I prefer to read after Mills n Boons &amp; Barbara Cartland.	2002-06-11

Prophet Mohammed's wisdom 'Ink of a Scholar is more holy than the blood of Martyr' is right said! Great Faith, Great Reveleations, Great Concern, Great Efforts and a `Bold, Outspoken  Voice by MJ, the Shade of Swords traces the roots of Jihad - `It is not an invitation to kill; it is an invitation to die'. Islamic faith demands in  a holy war, the blood of faithful in the defense of their faith and this is Jihad. The war that started years ago whose roots were deep as MJ traces the origins of Jihad, a research of hard work that has a fantastic, gripping story journeying across across centuries and continents, written after the fall of Moscow. The triumphant rise of Islam under the Prophet Muhammad when angel of God Gabriel read the word of God. Allah's messenger said `Paradise is under the shade of swords' and the spirit of Jihad entered Islam at Badr, Arabic jhad, meaning exertion or striving. As Mj puts it, \\"A holy war, the war of righteousness, the struggle against tyranny. A passion indifferent to the fate of battle because the jihadi wins either way: in the long run, the war will be won; and in the short run, death will bring martyrdom and paradise. A jihadi strife to cleanse one's soul as no martyrdom is possible without inner purity\\"  MJ has all the way a gripping history of Islam, the collapse of the Mogul and Ottoman empires to the modern struggle for Palestine. 'The West's next confrontation is definitely going to come from the Muslim world. It is in the sweep of Islamic nations from the Maghreb to Pakistan that the struggle for a new world order will begin.' Says MJ and reveals the History as anger and a literature of revenge that divided India and created Pakistan.MJ refers to contempts lucidly expressed by Bengali novelist like Bankimchandra, Mrityunjay and Saratchandra Chattopadhyay. These Bengali infused hate and triggered differences. Saratchandra in his speech and books said \\"Hindu muslim unity is a bombastic phrase, muslims were not satisfied merely with looting, they destroyed temples, demolished idols, raped women. The kings couldn't liberate themselves from these loathsome desires and even King Akbar was no better than notorious emperors like aurangzeb. Muslims were barbarians....And the school text books covers up these lessons!<br />Further MJ says about the partition and states, the muslims in the world to enjoy sustained democratic liberty are not in Pakistan but who remained in India and they pose more problems than anyone deserves, 150 million of them, paying price for their ancestors and success of muslim league. Witnessing the Babri mosque destruction in 1992, the resultant riots have become mob barbarism with administration giving a friendly nod to violence, fresh in Gujarat recently. MJ further pens down that Osama emerged out of Afghan experience with unshakeable conviction and later Al Qaida, The Foundation, became the vehicle for his politics, he as new caliph who would safeguard Muslim interest across the world. And as we witness the terror today, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef who dreamed of toppling twin towers was arrested and yet, the towers came down over eight years because that dream was not arrested and such organizations like Taliban and Al Qaida, without a government or a country befall terror and fight a jihad against the worst enemy America who declared war on Taliban and though the defeat of Taliban was complete, Osama Bin Laden is mystery but the spirit continues as a volunteer in the war in Afghanistan says `Jihad continues, if allah chose me to die, I would have been in paradise eating honey and watermelons and grapes...as promised in quran but my fate is to remain amid the unhappiness here on earth.<br />Mj concludes `Defeat is only a setback in the holy war...and the Jihad continues, the fire that is visible on the muslim streets across the world today is fuelled by a perception of injustice and exploitation by the west.

Financial Literacy is a part never taught in schools! The Rich Dad emphasis on Pg.46, his point of view that 'The poor and the middle class work for money - The rich have money work for them' In the opening chapter, Sharon Lechter is challenged by her son when she tells him 'If you don't graduate from college, you won't get good job and if no good job, how would you plan to get rich' The boy argues that he looks for new answers - Bill Gates or Michael Jordan never went to school yet they are Rich! And so it clicks to Sharon and Mike to realize their changing jobs which would never make them scale Richer as they expected. Getting impressed with the Cash flow of Robert, the book finds way into thoughts and actions covering up Lessons :<br />1. The rich don't work for money.<br />2. Why Teach Financial Literacy?<br />3. Mind your own business?<br />4. History of Taxes and power of corporations<br />5. The rich invent money<br />6. Work to learn - Don't work for money<br />The educated Dad's personal financial statement determines the life of someone in the rat race, his expenses seem to always keep up with his income never allowing him to invest whereas the logic to a Rich Dad's financial statement speaks of assets generating more income and re-investing after covering the expenses. Result is the Richer get richer. It's thoughts that concerns 'Taking risks and greed, a common attitude' that scales for higher earnings. The Book is not a Business Lesson but a thoughtfully written wisdom to come out of the 'rat race' and plan to be rich with the changing new waves. Right Book for every parent and all who dream to be Rich!	2002-05-25

Harold Kushner's book has an insight for a heart touching, warming feeling for those who got to be content with Suffering. Some of the other time in life, we suffer. Why do we have to suffer? Why do Bad things Happen? Why Me? These and many questions surface our minds and that's when our 'Faith' is challenged. Why do we turn to the same God who makes it happen? The author came to see god when he faced the worst trials in his life of having lost his son Aaron when he was fourteen. God weeps with us and would not abandon us and can fill the deepest needs of an anguished heart says Harold. The story of job inspires and builds the strength and courage. Harold provides invaluable reassurances and his words are source of comfort in times of bad things happening just out of the blue. His logic that when bad things happen we dump our anger on others or turn it on ourselves. Sometimes angry on God. Why me? And then referring to Cain killing his brother Abel in a fit of jealousy...all through Harold soothes the mind to relax and be at peace saying 'God can't do everything, but he can do some important things' This ticks the mind Fate, not god, sends us the problem. If we are weak, we get angry, overwhelmed. Its faith strong all the way and God rewards in his own fashion; Knows much better what he has to do. A must book to be read by all people in trouble, no matter what their religios faith. Indeed, When Bad things happen, be positive, What happens, happens for good.

But the moment I got this set and paced to race to track the fantasy, it dawned to me that these are the magical witty adventure excitement that are make great readers n recites.

Challenges come their way to face wizards n dangers in fantasy world and they fight their way out for a rosy end. There is humour, the language flow and the right stuff right there for keeping you stick to turn the pages in awe excitement n fun. However, I would recommend educators n parents to make the kids dive into fantasy work lest their imagination run dry. And encourage to write the reviews n send review letters to friends about the tales which would further make them read more Harry potter or Enids.Also this would ensure that the books is really read! So, pick them cool n let this be a Reading experience n pleasure, after all! Great picks!	2002-05-06

Stars shine down...its like shimmering sparkling down with the twinkling shine...Sure Sid's book are all great but this one I felt has a theme of a beautiful Lara Cameron who is a self made billionaire whose character in the book revolves round fortune n fame. Interesting to read as Lara struggles to reign into male domain and portrays a ruthless character feeling insecure at times. She has busy appointments for the day and strive to achieve for more as she travels from London to New York and Reno to Rome and when her fortune dwindles, its the pages you never stop to read. At times the theme seems fine but bit too heavy with stepping in of Alder who offers Lara an exciting new dimensions at a price to pay that threatens to destroy them both.

Emmy Award winner CBS News Reporter, Bernard Goldberg, narrates his  Liberally biased outbursts of the very secrets of the television network media. Bias is bottomless Intellectual corruption revealed by fearless and courageous reporter. Goldberg has revealed the blunt truth, inside scoop of stories and dared to come forward to portray how liberal Bias infuse bias reporting in network television and trigger hindrance to reporting facts. Issues ranging from homelessness to aids, reporters are going over the misinformation of pressure groups they favor, to the harm of honest reporting. Fairness, balanced and integrity disappeared with changing times in network television. There has been one-sided nature of reporting of the news coverage tilting to the left as Goldberg mentions;  which is close minded and journalists honesty have become pawn to liberal opinion. Goldberg tried to voice his say from post to pillar but his critics considered him a disgruntled Reporter and his bitterness with the management made him write the WSJ op-ed story that ruined his career! The television news business is far different from the media print world and far often the primary objective is overlooked with bias reporting in television network. Political correctness in network television creates a sensation ahead of the facts and enthusiasm of the reporters mis-fires the message, often misleading the viewers to create waves over the issue. A recent example is the Riots of Gujarat, the whole print and television media journalists focused on the one major issue and harp over the incidents to raise the heat of news reporting. Balance reporting fell out of gear and the news that shoot and create waves chart to the top and the biggest scoop story of the time would probably not be heard in the evening news. The bias really affect on how people view to see the world!  Goldbergs CBS reporting experience made him opine his voice boldly about the truth that pervade the business and his trials led him to pen down Bias with the opening harsh critics of Dan Rathar who regards criticism of liberal bias as disloyalty and after working in network news for 30 years as CBS reporter Goldberg comes out with Bias with names, quotes, reports n facts. Certainly a pick and a concern for every Journalist in network television or print media, the BIAS by Bernard Goldberg would turn a new leaf in reporting facts.ls led him to pen down Bias with the opening harsh critics of Dan Rathar who regards criticism of liberal bias as disloyalty and after working in network news for 30 years as CBS reporter Goldberg comes out with Bias with names, quotes, reports n facts.

The scars of deep wounds are not yet healed when terror knock down the WTC Towers six months ago and here again, the endless natural and man made catastrophe leaves its trails of unforgetful memories of deeper wounds -  trauma and hurt with recent Communal Riots in India and Earthquake in Afghanistan. Deepak Chopra in Deeper Wounds describes the emotional states that people go through after a traumatic event so as not to get a person mired with stages of fear, anger, anxiety, shock, helplessness and depression. Deepak uses the perspective to spill off hate from the heart to scratch off the emotional wounds. The author explains that healing yourself comes in two stages-first releasing the energy of suffering, then replacing it with the soul's energy. In the face of tragedy, the first section of the book defines suffering as painful and way of life to a `Hundred days of Healing', daily assertion, exercises, lesson plans and insight to sparkle up the spiritual flame to heal the wounds inside. Deepak's book is in response to the affected people in the tragedy of the twin towers, a portion of the proceeds earned by the author and publisher would be donated to Red Cross and charities on humanitarian grounds. A deeper wound is an exceptional book that raises psychological and spiritual issues raised by the attacks at WTC. Chopra deals with spiritually acceptance of `Where was God when you need him most?' by helping to understand and cope up with trauma situations and overcome negative emotional hurt to restore strength and faith back to gear. He believes and pens down that evil is a form of egoism and describes the power of compassion and awareness.

Most successful leaders are emotionally intelligent but yet remains problems to tackle with new ideas, diversed fields and more and over, Emotionally being stable to balance to lead the organization to par excellence. Communication is the key to success and that is also one factor that misleads many Leaders to stumble the blocks with the correlated managers and staff.

Furthermore, US foreign policy has been consistently erratic, misguided and low over the same period. When confronted with aggression, US has failed and totally ineffective and a half hearted stand.
