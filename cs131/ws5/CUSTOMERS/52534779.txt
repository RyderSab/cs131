US	52534779	R3GZKLDFHKGM4D	0375422404	530251799	Mythology: The DC Comics Art of Alex Ross	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A Coffee Table Book For the Comic Book  Lover In Your Life	Alex Ross has to be one of the most talented and the most overlooked artist in the 21st century.  After hitting the ground running with the smash hit graphic novels KINGDOM COME and MARVELS, Ross has set the bar not only for comic book artist, but the art world itself.<br />Ross's style could be that compared to Norman Rockwell's.  Each piece is life like and poingnant.  MYTHOLOGY even covers the process that Ross undertakes to bring his creations to life.  Not so unlike Norman Rockwell, Ross uses models and snapshots<BR>to help him create depth in his pieces.  It was facinating to read how he accomplishes this feat.<br />MYTHOLOGY covers Alex Ross's life from his early artwork from age 5 up to present day.  A nice touch to see how his artistic style has changed and matured as he grew up.  <BR>Also covered are never before seen sample artwork for KINGDOM COME as well as MARVELS.  <BR>The Justice League is given much press with unpublished paintings and drawings that never went to the printing press.  Ross even shares his notebook with the reader, as we delve into<BR>character studies for an unpublished CRISIS ON THE INFINITE EARTHS story as well as an unpublished script synopsis for a Christian themed superhero.<br />However great MYTHOLOGY is as a coffee table book, or even an art lovers book, I did have a problem with it.<br />Main problem is the font used for the text.  Ross opted for a low font size which is printed over many of the pictures in book.  Keeping true to a comic book style, this is terrific, but extremely difficult to read. Granted this book is a book to be looked at and absorbed on its artistic merits alone, but Alex's story also holds it's own and deserved to be read. <br />Overall, MYTHOLOGY is a must have book.  <BR>Insightful for the artist wannabe.<BR>Breathtaking for the comicbook collector.<BR>Astounding for the art lover.<BR>Make it the one to place on your coffee table.	2003-12-29

My beliefs weren't an issue<BR>with our marriage until I re-affirmed my beliefs in Christ a few years ago. <BR>If I mention so much as a desire to go back to church, my wife hems and haws and threatens divorce.  I've never pushed my beliefs on my wife, and likewise she with me, but I was concerned about the backlash she unleashes when the subject of God comes up in our household.<BR>I heard Lee and Leslie talking on a radio program about their book and figure I give it a shot.<BR>On the upside much of what Lee and Leslie went through I could identify with, since they themselves went through the same thing.  In their case, Leslie is Christian and Lee was Atheist. Many of the fights and situations they described I've gone through to some degree with my wife.  The solutions to those problems are of course outstanding, but the Strobels give some tools to the reader in dealing with you and your spouses differing perspectives.  <BR>I've used those tools, and they've helped somewhat.  Not a total solution, but very helpful in keeping a hot subject from escalating into disaster.<BR>However I felt a bit letdown in the tone of their book since the Strobels have the notion that men, not women, in a majority are seperate from Christ.  Thus the reader is addressed that &quot;your husband this...&quot; and &quot;your husband that...&quot;<BR>Well, my problem isn't with &quot;a husband&quot; but with &quot;my wife&quot;.<BR>This tone sort of made me felt left out when reading the book.  The Strobels acknowledge this oversight, but wouldn't it be better to just address the oversight by being non-gender specific?<BR>Also I had a problem with lack of scripture reference.  As I mentioned, the Strobels offer many tools in dealing with spiritual conflict with your partner.  The problem is they say God wants you to do this, or something else to please your partner but doesn't give a specific scripture reference which I can follow.  The bibliography in the back of the book just references other books, which in turn doesn't do much in satisfying my hopes that I'm acting in a Christian way.<BR>Another problem I had was there were a few sections in the book that addressed Christain people that were seeking relationships with non-Christians.  Why mention this at all, since you're buying this book to solve a crisis after the fact?<BR>Its like saying, &quot;Hey dummy, if listened to God to begin with you wouldn't be in this mess.&quot;<br />These chapters have no business being in the book, since the basis of the book is mismatched married couples, not a Christian's guide to dating non-Christians.<BR>Another problem I had was Lee's salvation.  I'm very happy for Lee that he let Christ into his life, but the fact of the matter is not every mismatched couple has a resolution like this.  The Strobels mention some cases where the non-Christian partner does become saved, but how can you expect to setup your reader for this outcome. Its almost a bit pretencious.  I would have liked to have read more about situations that are more closer to home like how does one partner deal with the other partner never coming to Christ?  How do you survive that?<BR>The prayer guide in the back of the book is helpful in seeking God's help in these matters of peaceful coexistance of two people who love each other and have different views of life and eternity.<BR>This book is very helpful and I encourage anyone who is going through a mismatch to read it.  Great tools in dealing with a big problem.	2003-12-12

Ever wonder what your purpose in this world is or what lies beyond it?<BR>Are you unhappy with your life?<BR>Wish there was something better than where you are now, or how you live your life?<br />Well, there is a solution, and Rick Warren points us all to the answer. Mr. Warren has created the first self-help book at looks outside the self.<br />What do all self-help books suggest?  The answer lies within you.  Your problem and solution are within you.  Really?<br />Let me ask you a question, that the author poses.   If I gave you an invention, some device lets say, and I asked you to figure out how it worked, what would you do?<BR>Ask the person who created the device?<BR>How about look up how the device works in some form of an instruction manual?<BR>Well, when it comes to you, where is your instruction manual?  One didn't pop out of the womb when you were born.<BR>Well, actually the creator of you, and all of us did leave an instruction manual of sorts.<br />Its the bible. <br />The very word of God.  Its his message to us.  What God expects from us. How to live our life. What awaits us in the next life and eternity.<br />Rick Warren has put together the most comprehensive manual on how to live like a Christian.  He's divided the book into<BR>40 chapters, and suggests that you read only one chapter a day.   The chapters breakdown a particular area of subject matter, backed by very appropriate passages from the New Testament.  Each chapter ends on a reflection for the reader to think and pray about.<br />The author poses 5 points that a Christian should live by in order to not only life a fulfilling Christian life, but also have a meaningful relationship with God and a fulfilling life in heaven. The main points are belief in Jesus Christ and how you live your Christian life.<BR>The first point determines if you are going to heaven.  The second point determines what you are going to be doing in heaven.<br />The remaining points the author makes help clarify what is expected of us Christians.   Many Christians these days don't go to church, or go to church only 1 day a week.  God doesn't want you one day a week.  He wants you every moment of the day.<BR>The author suggests in our daily activities, no matter what they are to do them in remembrance of the Lord.  By doing so, he suggests that we are in fact worshipping God.  Also, its important to attend Church to maintain fellowship with other Christians. <BR>Fellowship can't be stressed enough as it helps us all in our walk.<br />Prayer?  Many of us don't pray enough.  Rick Warren gives some great suggestions on improving prayer.  I'm finding that I pray more often than I've prayed before.  I thank God for Rick Warren's ideas.<br />Purpose Driven Life is a great book, but I did have some problems with it.<br />What I didn't like about the book?<br />I understand that Rick Warren would like to make money from this book.  Hey, how else is he going to pay the bills and upkeep. <BR>The first chapter and final section in Purpose Driven Life covers all the Purpose Driven Life branded items you can buy along with this book.<BR>Purpose Driven calendar with inspirational quotes.<BR>Purpose Driven date book.<BR>Purpose Driven mouse pad, coffee mug...etc...etc.<BR>I found commercial aspect of these sections to border on the tacky.  It wasn't enough to detract from the book and the message<BR>presented, but it sort of put me off initially.  Perhaps a single page in the end of the book with a web address to a site that sells these items would be more appropriate.<br />Also, the author claims that God has changed many people's life in the course of 40 days.  He gives a number of biblical examples from Noah, to Daniel, to Jesus Christ.   Yes, God does work miracles in our lives over time, but to make a claim that God is going to change your life in 40 days is a bit preposterous.   God works on his time, not ours.  How do you know that someone may read this book in 1 day and not be<BR>changedby its word in a week?  How about a year?  A few years?  First time Christians or even those that are seeking the Christian life may be let down in expectations that God is going to change them in 40 days.  <br />Overall I highly recommend Purpose Driven Life to the new as well as the old Christian alike. I've been a born-again Christian for about 3 years and I feel that Mr. Warren's book has added a new dimension to my relationship with<BR>God that I've overlooked.	2003-05-30

How wrong I've been.<BR>The ultimate dystopian society is that which seeks to destroy its future. An every societies future is in its children.<BR>With so much in the news of Columbine and school shootings, Battle Royale has upped the ante with its vision of teenage violence.<BR>What a better way to control society than with seeding fear and mistrust within its children.  With such a notion planted, there would be no way for the future adults to overthrow the dictatorship that exists.<br />The story takes place in an isolationist Japan.  The government controls everything.  Music, news, clothing, you name it.<BR>Prefecture Class B is on a class trip when the entire class is drugged and knocked out.  They awake in a school house on a deserted island off the coast of Okinawa.  They're greeted with soldiers surrounding the room and a sadistic Mr. Kitano as they're instructor for this years Battle Royale.<br />What is Battle Royale? <BR>At random, an entire junior high school class is abducted and taken away to a secret location (usually an island).<BR>They have explosive collars placed around their necks and given a knapsack containing the following:<BR>3 days of water<BR>3 days of food (government issue bread)<BR>A map of the island<BR>flashlight<BR>random weapon.  <br />Its interesting the weapons they are given.  Some are given guns, knives, bullet proof vests, clubs and kitchen utensils.<BR>Students are pulled one person at a time at two minute intervals and given a pack and told to leave the school grounds.<br />The rules are simple.  Kill your fellow student. <BR>Last student standing is the winner.  After 3 days if no student is standing then the explosive collars are activated and all remaining students are killed.<BR>Every 6 hours certain zones on the island are forbidden.  Crossing into thesezones will cause the collars to detonate.<BR>So, the question running through every student's mind is, can I kill my fellow classmate to survive?<br />Can I kill my best friend?<br />My secret crush?<br />Should I take my chances and play the game, or perhaps band together with my fellow students and find a way to escape?<BR>The student portrayals are right on the money.  All 42 students are portrayed with all their ambitions, hang ups, crushes and<BR>personalities.  I could identify with every student in the class, because we're either were one of those students at one time or went to school with them.  The class clown. The nerdy loner.  The class jock.  The prettiest girl.  They are all here and the author almost makes you care about these people. They are all by no means 2-dimensional.  <br />Every chapter ends with a body count of the remaining class members.  Starting from 42 class members remaining the body count goes down from chapter to chapter and the tension increases from chapter to chapter.<br />Who wins?  You'll be surprised at the twist ending which completely comes out of left field.  The entire book is a page turner, but its the last 30 pages that you'll have a difficult time putting the book down until the very end.<br />This is a first time novel for the author Koushun Takami.  Overall a job well done, and I look forward to his future work.	2003-05-28

It looks like Gold Eagle needs to be doin' some chillin' in regards to the writers they pick to write these books.<BR>Fireblast awful.  Simply awful.<br />As of late, the Deathland books have been following a pretty lame formula.<br />1) Group arrives at a redoubt.<BR>2) Group searches redoubt for weapons/food/...etc.<BR>3) Everyone leaves redoubt to figure out where they are.<BR>4) Firefight with abligatory mutie.<BR>5) Cutscene to crazed oppressive baron.<BR>6) Ryan and Co. either:<BR>     all get captured<BR>     Half the group gets captured<BR>     Dean gets captured<BR>     all get hired as crazed baron's head of sec<BR>7) Dean exclaims \\"Hot Pipe!\\" about 10-20 times.<BR>8) Barron plots Ryan and Co demise.<BR>9) Ryan or someone from the group figure out they're in trouble and plot to take out barron and/or henchmen/sec force.<BR>10) Lots of firefights<BR>11) Barron and/or sec force meets grisley demise.<BR>12) Dean exaclaims \\"Hot Pipe!\\" a few more times to boot.<BR>13) Ryan and Co head back to redoubt.  Ryan and Krysty wonder if they'll ever find a place to settle down.  Like how many times have they had this conversation already and not acted upon it?<br />Skydark Spawn falls into this formula as Ryan and the women-folk get kidnapped by Barron Fox and his sec force to be used in a breeding farm for babies.  Okay, sounds somewhat interesting, and probably would be more interesting if this plot device hasn't been used about 10-15 times already.  Also the author of this book has some form of misconception that gritty (Thats what a true Deathlands book is) is equal to pornography.<BR>The portrayal of sex in this book, I'd have to equate with that of a teenage boys masterbatory fantasies.  Granted the Barron is a twisted pervert, but the amount of time and embellishment the author spends on the twisted sex supercedes the plot and pacing of the story.  <BR>All through the story we're treated to people forced to perform oral sex, people forced into rape situations, cut scenes of the Barron flipping through skin mags, sec people waving their gentials and fighting in the nude.  What exactly is going through Gold Eagle's mind here?<BR>Also, what was the point of the side story with the fishing village looking for new breeding material?  A pointless plot device that goes nowhere in the story and its contribution to the ending of the story seemed very rushed. Its as if the author ran out of new offensive sexual situations and had to figure out a quick way to end the story.<br />If Skydark Spawn is the example of the \\"New and Improved\\" Deathlands, then Gold Eagel, you have pretty much killed the series for Deathlands fans.<br />My recommendation is to skip this book and opine for the good all days when Laurence James wrote these books.	2003-05-21

Book #11 in the long winded Left Behind series, is another example of poor writing, and slipshod plot.<br />Writing mistakes are abound in this installment.  I can't help but wonder if LaHaye and Jenkins actually took time to run their story through a spell and grammar checker...  In the last 50 pages of the book, Chloe gives a big speech and the entire speech is encapsulated in a series of open quotes.  What?<br />...Where to begin?<br />The story starts 6 years into the great Tribulation.  Only one more year to go before the glorious appearing of Jesus Christ.  When we last left our heroes, the force had spread out.  Buck, George, Chloe and company in a bunker in San Diego.  Steele and Mac rescuing Chang from Babylon capital suffering under the judgment of God...<br />Death permeates in Armageddon.  Chloe gets a \\"close shave\\"...<br />The story ends in a cliffhanger, as to who really dies in the end between...  Yet, why worry, since everyone will be around in book 12 for the curtain call. That's of course the authors don't milk this puppy dry with a book 13.<br />As for the villains in this story, are they really villainous?  Carpathia seems to act more like a mincing housewife than the Antichrist.  The way he acts in the story, I expect him to be dressed in all black twirling a pencil thin mustache while laughing maniacally.  He's not really scary and I'd be surprised if he struck any fear into the average reader of this series.  This is the end of the world so to speak.  Satan has free reign over us.  He's suppose to strike mortal fear into our hearts.  You'd think one of the authors would portray the man like he should be portrayed.  He needs to be more ruthless than Hitler, and more bloodthirsty than Stalin.  Any mention of Carpathia's evil deeds are really glossed over in this series.  I think the story would have been more robust if LaHaye or Jenkins painted a truer picture of Tribulation life, than the cartoon they are presenting us with. I cringe at the thought of book 12.  We're talking the appearance of Jesus Christ here.  If the authors can't write a decent villain, what makes them think they'll be able to write a decent hero?<br />...

US	52534779	R2KXHAPPFVH6MO	0849917492	181376833	Paul: A Man of Grace and Grit (Great Lives from God's Word, Volume 6)	Books	5	36	38	N	N	A challenging portrait of a man devoted to Christ	Charles Swindoll's Paul: A man of grace and grit is a fascinating look at one of the New Testament's biggest<BR>contributors.  Saul of Tarusus or better known as Paul the apostle is truly a man of grit.  Born in a Jewish family.<BR>A devout follower of Judaism.  A man devoted to Jewish law and persecuting Christians.  Swindoll fleshes out Saul from the book of Acts<BR>in great detail.  Saul persecuted Christians as Hitler persecuted Jews during the 1940's.  Saul was a man who violently<BR>opposed to Christ, his teachings, and his followers.  He hunted them down.  Tried them, and stoned them.<BR>Odd that such a man would end up not only worshipping Jesus, but also writing some of the most beautiful words in the New Testament and spreading the gospel.<BR>How strange that such a man who spewed forth such hate toward Christians would turn around and write such a beautiful<BR>testament to love (Letter to Corinthians).<br />Swindoll's Paul is presented in 22 chapters, that cover everything from Paul's beginnings, meeting with Christ risen, to his ministry, and finally his death.   Each chapter refers and reflects to appropriate bible passages, mostly those from Acts.<BR>What was surprising was that each chapter also ended in a reflection.   For example, chapter 2: The violent capture of a rebel will, covers Saul's encounter with Christ.  Here a violent man is converted into a spokes person for the very person Saul hates the most.  Amazing really.<BR>Swindolls refers to this change as \\"Kicking against God's goads\\".   \\"To kick against the goads\\" was a common expression found in both Greek and Latin literature, which rose from the practice of farmers goading their oxen in the fields.  Goads were typically made from slender pieces of timber, blunt on one end and pointed on the other.  Farmers used the pointed end to urge a stubborn ox into motion.  Occasionally, the beast would kick at the goad. The more the ox kicked, the more likely it would stab into the flesh of it leg, causing pain.<BR>Saul's conversion may not have been quick, but with Saul's previous violent lifestyle and Christ haunting words, those words may<BR>have been the \\"goad\\" that pushed Saul into Paul and a past of hate into a future of preaching the gospel.  Swindoll ends the chapter on a wonderful reflection on what \\"goads\\" you?  Is God goading you perhaps?<BR>Are you holding onto some rebellious attitude that perhaps the Lord is goading you to let go of?<BR>Each chapter has a reflection like this.  Each chapter not only brings us closer to how Paul lived, but also asks us to examine our relationship with God, our loved ones, and even ourselves.<BR>This book is # 6 in the series.  I'll have to pick up the previous books, and sincerely hope that Charles Swindoll adds a #7 in the series.	2003-03-06
US	52534779	R2YD7YYLDEVPOU	0310218039	810531498	Eli	Books	5	6	7	N	N	3 Stories In 1	Eli by Bill Myers is a pleasant look at the \\"what-if\\" scenario of \\"What if Jesus existed Today?\\"<BR>Myers tackles this by inserting the events in the gospels of Matthew, John, and Luke and putting them<BR>into a modern day setting.  The events are pretty much the same, but the settings have changed.  For example<BR>instead of Jesus's \\"Sermon On The Mount\\" its more of \\"Sermon At Denny's\\".  Instead of the miracle of the loaves of bread and fishes<BR>we're treated to the miracle of feeding thousands from a bag of fries and hamburgers from the local non-descript McDonald's or Burger King.<br />Does Myers succeed in retelling this story of Jesus with a modern flair?  Yes and no.<br />The story is really 3 stories in 1.<br />Eli is pretty much told through the eyes of Conrad Davis.  Divorced and somewhat alienated<BR>from his daughter Julie, Conrad is your average workabholic T.V. journalist. His latest assignment<BR>deals with talking to a scientist about alternate worlds and quantum physics.  This sets the stage for what will rock Conrad's world.<BR>A freak car accident hurls him into an alternate reality.  A world were Jesus didn't exist 2000 years ago, but exists today.  Conrad meets<BR>up with his alternate version of his ex-wife.  His ex in this world was born-again, but in the world that Conrad has been thrust into, she is <BR>a follower of Eli.  Eli is Jesus Christ in this reality.   Plot 'A' in this book deals with a refreshing of the events marked in the gospel and adds<br />dimension and life to Jesus.  Myers does a great job of applying the teachings of Christ and how he handles his apostles in a 20th century setting.<BR>Myers also did a wonderful job in putting life into his character of Eli and demonstrating Jesus's love towards us all.<BR>The only problem I had was Myers never really set the stage enough to see really what kind of world does Conrad and Eli/Jesus live in during the 20th century.<BR>How is the world different if Christ wasn't here 2000 yearsago? Are people more hateful?  Less hateful?  Is language different?  I can imagine some <BR>aspect of language would be different since taking the Lord's name in vain is the most used exclamation. \\"Jesus Christ!\\"  The world is never<BR>really explored in depth here.  I know that wasn't the point the author was trying to deliver, but I would like to see how Myer's would see the world without<BR>Christ.<br />Plot 'B' in Eli deals with Conrad and more importantly grace.  God's grace to us.  You see, Conrad isn't saved. In this world, his ex-wife<BR>is saved.  Conrad spends more time at work than with his family.  His daughter Julie has probably taken the brunt of this issue, since she feels<BR>alientated from him.  By being tossed into this reality of a modern day Christ, Conrad is given an opportunity which many people don't take<BR>advantage of.  That is God's grace.  God's grace in giving us the chance to ask for forgiveness.  Grace to embrace Christ and turn from our sins.<BR>Conrad is given this chance by following Eli around in this reality.  Conrad sees all the miracles and listens to all the parables that Eli tells <BR>to his followers.  Yet, just by following the messiah around the country, does Conrad become saved?  You'll have to read the book to find out.<br />Plot 'C' deals with Conrad's daughter Juile.  As I mentioned she is alientated from her father.  Her story takes place in our present reality.<BR>She deals with visiting her comatose father in the hospital, all the while having flashbacks to her childhood and how little time she had spent with<BR>her father.  Her story deals with the important aspect of forgiveness.  How do you forgive?  Forgiveness is an important point that Jesus has taught us.<BR>We should always forgive.  Not once, but a thousand times if need be.  It is Julie's story that deals with this important lesson.<br />All three plots tie together in an enthralling story by Bill Myers.  I highly recommend to anyone interested in readingan innovative and compelling story.	2003-01-02

A diligent prole working for Machiavellian Foods Inc.<BR>Stuck in a dreary workaholic's paradise.  McDaniels paints a very good portrait of a man with<BR>very low self-esteem.   Micah's work life isn't right.  Belittled and dragged down by corporate <BR>life as well as eeking out a lonely life in a rundown apartment.  Life for Micah is dreary and repetitive<BR>without much change or success.  Even an attempt at an innovative resignation, to get back at the boss, ends in a <BR>failure of some sorts.<br />Tired of the failures in his life, Micah decides to end his life, but even that ends in failure, but opens Micah's eyes<BR>to something completely different.  Coltan.  Coltan is  Death's daily planner carrying assistant.<BR>Abrupt and to the point, he pushes Micah to complete the deed of committing suicide.<BR>Micah on the other hand starts to turn his life around after meeting his guardian angel Christine.<BR>From there, the story turns into a battle for Micah's life and soul between Christine, Coltran and Micah himself.<br />The story has some pros and cons to it.<br />First off the pros to this novel:<br />The character building and treatment was pretty dead on with Micah.  Adam McDaniels did a wonderful job bringing such a depressed individual to life.  <BR>After reading the first few chapters, even I was starting to get depressed at Micah's dreary life.  <BR>Also the circumstances of Micah's turn around from a person with very low self-esteem and outlook to someone that is<BR>self assured grew at an even pace as the story unfolded.  One of the toughest aspects of telling a story is keeping the pacing.  Adam <BR>McDaniels did a good job at keeping that pace of character building and growth as the story progressed.<br />The humor bordered on the slapstick, there were a few funny comments made.  One of my favorites concerns Christine talking with <BR>a fellow colleague McCormick about how she has her hands full with Micah.  His response got a chuckle out of me when he said, &quot;Think you've<BR>got it bad?  Try looking after a 7-11 cashier with a midnight shift in the Bronx, for Christ sake!&quot;<br />The cover.  The cover doesn't add much to the story, but McDaniels did paint the cover himself.  He is quite an accomplished artist, which I<BR>can't say for many writers in the field.<br />The cons to this novel:<br /> The story has a very non-christian approach to the meaning of life, God, and salvation.  Granted the story is a dark fantasy, but people with strong Christian <BR> beliefs may have a problem checking those beliefs in at the door when they read this book.  McDaniels treats salvation being attained<BR> from the good deeds you do instead of seeking forgiveness through Jesus Christ.<BR> <BR> Introduction of minor characters needed some work.  A little more time could have been spent with developing Micah's boss and Catherine<BR> Brandis.  Both are very minor characters in the book, especially so with Catherine's character, but I'm not sure the reason for having Catherine's<BR> character in the book.  She didn't really add much to the story for the exception of pointing out the mystery behind Coltan's character. Yet<BR> the readers would have been able to figure out Coltan well before getting to Catherine's comeuppance.<BR> <BR> The humor.  As I stated above, the humor sported on the slapstick, but I felt what some of the humor was forced or weak in some aspects.<BR> Definitely not on the level of Terry Prachett, or Douglas Adams.<BR> <BR> <BR> For a first novel, How To Succeed was a so-so attempt.

There have been some improvements and alot of downfall in LaHaye and Jenkin's latest Left Behind book \\"Remnants.\\"<br />First the improvements.  I guess either a ghost writer was hired by Tim and Jer, or they both learned how to use the spell/grammar checker.  The book was a lot  easier to read than the last outing \\"Desecration.\\"  The story's flow was a little better, but not much.  Secondly, I guess Tim and Jer decided to drop the stereotypical pigeon-english talk that prevails when Chang, Ming or Chang's parents talk.  They talk a little better in this story, or the mother speaks a little more fluently.  I'm glad that the authors decided to accept that not all oriental people talk in broken English.  It was either that or everyone is at the point in the Tribulation that God has dropped the language barrier.  I'm not sure.<br />Downfall is plenty here, I'm not too sure where to being.<BR>I guess my biggest beef with the story is how the authors treat people's reaction to the Tribulation.  You see, the issue here is God is passing judgements on humanity.  The people that are left behind on earth either recognize that God exist and that they sin and need to be cleansed of sin, or they ignore that God exist and follow Satan.  These judgements are nothing minor and make a full force hurricane look like a spring shower.  How do people react when such catastrophes like the ocean turning to blood, or the sun, stars and  moon loose 1/3rd of its illumination?   Nothing.  Doesn't phase anyone.  Oh well, what else is new?  Nobody is behaving in this book as if the world has gone down the chute.  No realistic behavior as the impact of plagues and environmental changes.  What do you think something like that would do to a person?  I wonder myself, and I'm sure Tim and Jerry wonder too, but never explore it here.<BR>The other thing about the story, that gets my goat, is the James Bond like plot.  Is this a book about what it would be like living during the great Tribulation, learning to forgive and ask/accept forgiveness or is this a story about Christian spies?   I think if you compare book #1; Left Behind, with this book, and you'll find the authors have de-railed completely from what they intended.<br />The characters here are ever so-annoying, and ever so 2-dimensional.  If Chloe was a real person, I'd just want to walk up and smack her as for the other characters.  Each character just gnaws on you for some reason or another.  Chloe is a major pain since she wants to spend more time on \\"mission\\" for God than on spending quality time with her child, especially when that time is very short and disaster is just around the corner.  Chloe makes all deadbeat dads look like saints.  Pathetic.<BR>The Anti-Christ, and False-prophet are reduced to a comicbook like buffoonery instead of an evil incarnate.  Fortunato doesn't do much in these stories accept to fawn over Carpathia.  There's no real prophesising by him per se.  Just alot of \\"yes sir\\" and \\"no sir.\\"<BR>Carpathia tops him all.  Not really scary, or the scariness just doesn't come out of this guy like I'd expect from someone so evil.  Actually I found on the false-prophets that Leon imbues with Satan's power more frightening than Carpathia and Fortunato put together.<BR>There is a scene 2/3rds through the book, where a character claiming to be Christ lures some \\"undecided\\" defectors from Petra to a marking station.  He amazes them with supernatural feats such as changing the weather, water from the ground, a basket of many loaves of bread...etc.  He then bestows the mark of the beast on each persons heads before killing them all in a horrible fashion.  That scene alone I found the most gripping.  A shame it was the only gripping scene in the book.<BR>Now if they only instilled that same evil that was demonstrated by the prophet onto Carpathia, then we'd have a more formidable Anti-Christ.<br />I also felt the story was rushed in some aspects, as a year in the Tribulation is covered in a couple of paragraphs.  I'm not sure the authors wanted to drag out the story another year for us readers, as they deposit us in year 5 of the Tribulation.  Only 2 more years before the appearing of Christ and a year before the brink of Armageddon starts.  Very little is covered story wise and the reader is not really left with much of a cliffhanger as the previous book.  <br />I can't say I'd recommend reading further books in this series for the only exception to see what happens to the characters.  Even then I don't think I can muster up much in the avenue of caring.	2002-08-02
US	52534779	R3JVDYJMS1M0IW	039453980X	214800958	THE THIRD MILLENIUM	Books	4	2	4	N	N	An Interesting Look At The Next 1000 years of Human History	I originally picked this book up back when it was published in 1985.  Stableford and Langford have put together a futuristic history book looking backwards from the year 3000 A.D.<br />The book it broken out in sections that cover 200-300 years of time.  For example, the years 2000-2190 are called The years of Crisis, as civillization is taken to the brink of conventional, nuclear and biological war. The predictions are presented like news articles.  They cover global events, economic stituations, entertainment, and medical advances.<BR>Its interesting at some of the future concepts that the authors posed back in 1985 in retrospect of the present.<BR>\\"The Third Millenium\\" theorizes that more 3rd world-like countries will have nuclear weapons.  Countries like Brazil, Argentina and Iraq or all places will have nuclear weapons. Its interesting, since when the book was published, Iraq was friendly toward the United States.  In no way could the authors predict the current world situation.<br />Same goes for medical situations in 2050 A.D. as a AIDs-like virus is prevalent and cured in the span of 10-20 years.  AIDs was still relatively unknown when the book was published.<br />Later centuries cover the \\"Age Of Recovery\\", as civillization start to merge into one world governments, and strides are made in peace and prosperity.  The UN is speculated as contributing a large role as the peacekeepers of the world and humanity.<br />The final three centuries deal with \\"Age Of Transformation\\", as science prevails in curing most diseases, discovering immortality, to creating new life-forms.   <BR>The approach takes on that no other intelligent \\"alien\\" life has been dicovered, implying that perhaps we are alone in the universe.<BR>I did, however, have a problem with the Christianity bashing the authors sprinkle in their book.<BR>The year 2000 has come and gone.  Christ hasn't returned, so people have lost their faith in Christianity.  They discover that religion is just pablum forthe masses, which in this day and age after Sept 11th, is the direct opposite.  Stableford and Langford selve Christianity with Maxisim, saying they are both doomed belief systems.  In their universe, in the 1000 year span they cover, Christ has never returned.  So therefore if Chist never returns, then Christianity is false.  I couldn't disagree more with that assumption.  If they disagree with the bible that is one thing, but at least know about your subject matter before making an attempt to invalidate it.  Jesus never gave a date when he would return.  \\"I will come like a thief in the night\\" he said.  Do you know when a thief will strike your house? No, I think not.	2002-05-10

As a fan of Space Operas and Star Wars, I'd have to say that George Lucas has made a vast improvement on the story line since the debacle with \\"The Phantom Menace\\".<BR>R.A. Salvatore's movie-tie in picks up the story 10 years after the events in Menace.<BR>Alot has changed.<BR>Seperatist are succeeding from the Republic.  Senator Padme` Amidala is trying to marshall Chancellor Palpatine and the senate to stop the seperatist.  An assassination attempt takes place against the senator, and from there it is only a matter of time before Obi-wan Kenobi and his teenage Padawan Anakin jump into the fray to become her protectors.  The story then dives in with Obi-wan trying to figure out who is trying to assassinate Padme' and Anakin dealing with his emotions toward Padme'.  <br />The story is puncuated with scenes of action and scenes of a budding romance between Anakin and Padme', which all rollercoaster toward an intense showdown with the dark forces that are at work.<br />What worked with this story?  The parring down of Jar-Jar Binks. <BR>Jar-Jar was a complete turn off for me and other fans.  Lukily Jar-Jar only makes a few appearances in the book, only covering perhaps a few pages in 2 seperate scenes in the story.  However, the scenes in question made me wince and only in the last 2/3rds of the story did Jar-Jar contribute anything that was worthwhile to the progress of the story.  Actually I could only wonder why he was included in the story line at all, but perhaps a rebellious George Lucas, who can't take no for an answer, stuck him in one last time (I hope)to re-iterate that \\"Yes, people love him!\\".  George, George, George.  Please kill off this character!  He really adds nothing to the story.<br />What didn't work?  The plot.  Don't get me wrong, but the plot to \\"Attack Of The Clones\\" is a vast improvement to the plot in \\"Phantom Menace\\".  Unfortunately I had a number of problems with some plot holes in the story.   For example, as Obi-wan was investigating theorigin of a dart that was used by an assassin, he discovers that the data about where the dart came from had been wiped from the Jedi library computers.  There was no real concern from any of the characters as to who or why this information was erased, and that perhaps the Jedi librarian made backup copies of the data?  Never explored to my liking as well as contradictions on how the Jedi behave or how battle scenes were resolved.<BR>The battle scenes in the end where very confusing as to who was doing what or what was going on exactly.  I, too, had to re-read paragraphs to figure out where characters were and when they appeared on the scene in the final confrontation.<BR>As for the Jedi behavior.  I found it to be contradictory to the situation that was going on.   Amidala's life has been threatened.  Yoda and Mace Windu suggest putting Obi-wan and Anakin in as body guards to protect the senator.  Well, after the 2nd assassination attempt fails, the 2 jedi split up under the suggestion of Yoda.  Anakin to protect Padme' and Obi-wan to investgate who the assassin is.  Well, if the Jedi were so keen on protecting Padme', then why put a teenage student in charge of her life?  Wouldn't it be better to put another more apt Jedi, perhaps a knight in charge?  Doesn't really make sense.<br />All in all, the story is a major improvement over Episode I.  I recommend reading the story to wet the appetite for the film, as well as fill in the blank as to character thoughts or deleted scenes.	2002-05-08

Let me just start off by saying that I enjoy Ray Bradbury's works immensely.<BR>&quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; has to be one of my all time favorites.  The book was a collection of short stories contained within a story.  The short stories where chilling, thought provoking, humorous, and sad.  The stories had a beginning, middle and an end. <br />Well Ray,  this ain't no Illustrated Man.<BR>When I picked this book up,  I was excited about the new places that Ray would be taking me. <BR>Time Travel?  I'm there.<BR>Ghosts?  Well boo me baby!<BR>What did I get?  Alot of disappointment.<BR>What is disappointing about &quot;One More For The Road&quot;?<BR>Well, for starter, the stories have no real ending, or the ending that Mr. Bradbury had chosen has nothing to do with the situation at hand, or perhaps the endings have deeper meanings in relation to the story, where we the reader have to think about how they relate to the rest of the story.  Regardless, its more work than I wanted to be satisfied with the story.  Mind you not all the stories are like this.  For example &quot;My Son, Max&quot; was well done as a lip reader uncovers some dirty laundry from a family of three at a restaurant.  The stories ending didn't leave me scratching my head at the end, and was quite poignant.<BR>&quot;Leftovers&quot; on the other hand, was a stretch and I had to re-read the ending and the last 3 pages to see if perhaps I had missed something in the story to tie the ending with what was going on in the tale.<BR>I'm not sure if &quot;One More For The Road&quot; is the last book for Bradbury.  I certainly hope not.   Ray Bradbury is a deeply talented author.  As for this compilation.  Alot of misses and a few hits.	2002-05-01

The merc's world is a reality where the nukecaust never happened, and the earth is groaning and dying under the weight of 100 billion people.   The solution for this reality's humanity is to colonize the Deathland's reality.<br />In \\"Breakthrough\\", the story picks up with a few of the characters from \\"Shadow World\\".   Dr. Huth, who is the scientist who invented the reality trans, is back, but accidently [fell] into [the]Deathlands from the doings of Cawdor and Co. in the previous story.  Dr. Huth gets a cheery Deathlands welcome, as he is truly a fish out of water in this reality.   <BR>The main protagonist, Dredds Otis Trask, is a woman on a mission.  Genetically enhanced, she is hellbent on setting up a beach head in Deathlands and enslave the locals into mining radioactive material to power her invasion force.<br />\\"Breakthrough\\" is fast paced, and seems rushed in some spots, especially the end of the story.  There were alot of unanswered questions as to how Ryan and his group got back to Moonboy via the mat-trans.  The previous reviewer mentions this, but in earlier Deathlands novels, Mildred came upon a CD with all the codes to each mat-trans unit.  So controled mat-trans jumps are possible, but never re-hashed in this story.<BR>\\"Breakthrough's\\" ending not only sets itself up for more sequels, but also reprocussions that will affect Ryan, Kristy and their friends.  It will be interesting to see how the ending of this storyline plays out in future Deathland novels as well as Outlander novels.<br />The alternate reality storyline in Deathlands seems to be a pleasant change of pace in the series.   This novel mentioned briefly on the inside cover that Deathlands would be undergoing changes come June (which is the time the next book comes out).  What ever changes Gold Eagle is considering making, they should definitely explore alternate reality stories in future novels.	2002-04-29

Character development or lack of.<BR>2. Stereotypes.<BR>3. Writting, or lack of.<BR>4. Plot, barring what is outlined in Revelations.<br />Character development.  I'd have to say after pounding out 9 books, you'd think that Lahaye and Jenkins would have spent some extra time developing the characters a little more better.  Its not like they have spend any extraneous amount of time fleshing out the story, I mean its all written in Revelations.  Carpathia and his flunkies i.e.; Leon, Viv, Mr Moon..etc are all quite 2-dimensional and have no real substance.  Okay, you're the Anti-Christ, not some mincing cartoon character.  Why is it when the Lord releases another judgement against mankind, and it ends up sticking it to Carpathia, that we're treated to some sort of comical childlike antics instead of something more menacing that you'd think a real Anti-Christ would do?  Yes, these people are evil and have abandon the Lord, but does that make them congentially stupid too?<br />I have alot of problems with how characters react in these books.  First example is Chloe, Ray Steele's daughter.  She is busy taking care of her infant son while in a safe-house in Chicago.  She's antsy about getting out and going on &quot;missions&quot; for the Trib-force.  Hello?  You have a newborn son and you want to go out an play spy during the most horrific period in human history?  Aren't you concerned on how you're going to feed your child or protect him from the trials and judgements up head?  Thats to say nothing about having a child during this period of time! Do you really want to expose a child to mass death and destruction?  This isn't a snow storm or huricane thats coming, this is God's wrath. <BR>Hattie Durham.  What is up with this character?  Granted, she does remind me of someone who I have in my life, but she hasto be the most annoying character ever created.  Even after she becomes saved, she still is annoying.  You'd think that the authors would beef up the character a little  or take her in another direction, but before they even attempt something like that, they tend to &quot;off&quot; her. <br />Stereotypes.  I want to present Mr. Lehaye and Jenkins with the 2001 KKK award for best sterotype of a race or culture.  Case in point to how he treats dialog pertaining to Chang Wong's parents.  I don't think I've heard such classic broken english since my last trip to Chinatown.<br />&quot;Okay son.  You don't tell father you believe in God.  No, No, No.  I talkie with him.  You just sit there and be good son.  I make you pork flied lice and press you shirt.&quot;  Oh puleeze!<BR>Why do all chinese people have to speak in pigeon english?  Is it necessary to insult the intelligence of the reader to assume just because somone is from another country other than the United States, that they don't have basic knowledge or mastery of the english language.  It was strange reading some of the dialog that went one between Chang and his mother.  I was almost expecting anyone with a Mexican nationality to walk around wearing a sombrero and eating refried beans, or someone of Irish decent getting crocked on whiskey every chance they got.  <br />Writting.  I believe both authors have written many books on the subject of Christianity.  I haven't had the opportunity to read any of there other works, but I believe the books had little in regards to story outline or pacing, or even dialog for that matter.  I think the greatest strength that both authors have is their knowledge in the Bible and their interpetation of the events outlined in Revelations.  Aside from that they need to invest heavily in a spell checker and a proof-reader.  Granted, I'm no Shakespeare, but if you're going to tell a story, you need to do it right.  I found that I had to read and re-read a number of paragraphs againand again because of lousy grammer and sentence structure.  I'm certain that Jenkins and Lehaye are trying to pound these books out as fast as they can type on a keyboard.  I'm sure they're rushing these books out with little thought as to checking what they are writing or saying really makes sense.  If they slowed down a little and re-read their work, I'm sure they could fix the writting up a little.<br />Plot.  Only reason why I'm reading the series is to see how they flesh out Revelations.  As a firm believer in the Bible and Christ, I shed no doubt that these events outline in Revelations will come to term.  When is anyone's guess.  What I wonder, or fear is what will the days of the Tribuation be like.  That was my hope that the authors would shed some light on.  Unfortunately, were treated to very little of post-rapture life and plenty of James Bond-like antics that don't really add up in a world that is being shaken up by God's judgements.  You'd think that these people would be more concerned for their own safety or where they are going to get their next meal or if they're going to die tomorrow than worry about situations that are completely in God's hands.<br />My recommendation for Left Behind is to leave it behind.  If you are looking for a more personal account on what the  Tribulation will be like on a more human perspective, I recommend &quot;We All Fall Down&quot; by Brian Caldwell.	2001-12-21

Don't get me wrong.  I love the Dirk Pitt adventures since reading &quot;Mediterranian Caper&quot; in the early 80's.<BR>Cussler's Pitt adventures have a formula to the story.  It goes something like this:<br />1. Some mysterious historical event takes place in the past.<BR>2. Cut to the present.  Some event/disaster takes place with the help of a meglomaniac.  Pitt and Co are nearby to soften the blow or thwart the deed.<BR>3. Queue damsel in distress at event/disaster.  Pitt charms the damsel and learns about evil plot.<BR>4.  Enter cameo appearance by Clive Cussler himself. (it was fun the first couple of times, but come on!)<BR>5. Enter evil henchmen who butt heads with Pitt and Pitt's pal Giordino.<BR>6. Evil meglomaniac introduces himself to Pitt.  Menacing banter ensues.<BR>7. Pitt with help of cute damsel and pal Giordino uncover evil plot.<BR>8. Pitt and Co. take out evil henchmen and put the kablitz on evil plot.<BR>9. Evil meglomaniac meets fateful end.<BR>10. Mysterious historical event in #1 is figured out by Pitt.<BR>11. The end.<br />Vahalla Rising as well as just about every Dirk Pitt adventure follows the same formula to some degree or another.  The story is entertaining, but tired in some spots.  I was kind of surprised that the evil meglomaniac (a psychotic Bill Gates type) doesn't appear until about 1/2 way into the story.  The story has some prophesy to it in that it deals with a potential terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (note the book was published a month before the actual WTC attacks).<BR>There is a pleasant twist on the final chapter in the book, but I felt this emotional plot twist was rushed or put in as a afterthought.  I'm guessing Cussler sprung this twist on us since Pitt complains a number of times that he is starting to feel his age.<BR>I look forward to Cussler's next outing with Pitt and I hope he breaks away or adds to the formula I've put together above.	2001-10-16

Tears of boredom.<br />I don't know what is up with Robert Silverberg and his &quot;Masterpiece&quot;, I use that term loosely, &quot;The Alien Years.&quot;  I haven't had the chance to read many of his works, and figure I'd start out with this novel.<br />The premise sounded engaging.  A mysterious alien race comes to Earth, and takes over. <br /> Okay.  <br />Its been done before.  Although I'd hardly equate this book with the likes of &quot;Indepence Day&quot;, the story had promise, but was executed poorly.<br />&quot;Alien Years&quot; covers from the present day all the way into the future 55 years from now.   The aliens, who are rarely seen, nor heard from, telepathically manipulate humanity with their psychic &quot;pushes&quot;.  The &quot;pushes&quot; are powerful will-breaking telepathic suggestions, which no one can escape.  So if an alien &quot;pushes&quot; you to slit your throat, you'll helplessly pick up a knife and run it across your throat.   The aliens also possess technology that shuts down all electrial machinery i.e.; turbines, computers, generators  at will.   With such disruption, the world is thrown in a state of chaos.  In comes Col. Anson Carmichael.  War hero, and all around patriot. He and his family hold out in his compound in Northern California.  Plotting revenge and revolution against the unyielding alien dictators who have enslaved humanity. That is,  there never really is any revolution.  Anson Carmichael just does nothing for some 300+ pages and 35 some odd years.  There is no action that really takes place.  The reason why the aliens invade the Earth is never known, and by the time humanity takes arms and strikes back...the aliens just pick up and leave.<br />The motivation behind the aliens is never explored.   The author introduces a clan of people that the reader really just doesn't care about.  I surmise that perhaps, yes, Silverberg was trying to capitalize on the &quot;Independence Day&quot; wave that hit the cinemas, but hesorely misses the mark.	2001-06-13

This is incorrect.  Its actually George Washington Carver that invented peanut butter as well as over 200 uses for the peanut. Kellogg did not invent peanut butter, but may have advocated its use as a protien substitute instead of eating meat or any type of animal flesh.<br />As for my review.  I found Boyle's take on the post-victorian era health fad to be entertaining.  I was facinated by the ignorance of health issues back in 1907 as well as the plethora of &quot;snake oil&quot; salesmen, Kellogg included, who tried to petal some of the most ridiculous cures for the most common malaise. All symptoms of aches and pains were diagnosed by Kellogg as &quot;autointoxication of this&quot; or &quot;autointoxication of that&quot; This and that being eating of meat or drinking of alcohol.  Its a marvel that so many people were eager to put their lives in the hands of people who were in no way, shape, or form trained in the medical profession. A scary journey into the birth of the health and nutrition era.	2001-06-13

Sea Of Silver Light(SOSL) is the coup de gras of the Otherland series. After finishing this story I had bittersweet feelings.  Like saying goodbye to good friends after a long journey.   The story wraps up a lot of loose ends and questions that are brought up in the previous novels.   How did Otherland came to be? What is Otherland? Why are the children in comas? Who lives...who dies?<br />Williams does a great job with this story, and I appreciate the synopsis at the begining of SOSL that covered the events of the first 3 books.  Its nice to have a few paragraphs detailing the events of the last 3 books to refresh the memory and figure out where the characters left off at the end of the 3rd book.<br />A question comes to mind, while reading this massive tome, does this story really need to be told in 900+ pages? The answer is no, not really.  Tad Williams could have easily wrapped up the entire story in 500-600 pages, but the extra 300+ pages cover side stories involving characters travels in other worlds in the Otherland network as well as characters in the real world.<br />The pacing of the story makes up for the extra verbosity of the story. As for the ending of SOSL, be prepared as not every character makes it out of this story in one piece or even alive. Good or bad, some characters bite the dust.<br />An excellent series by Tad Williams.  I look forward to his next story, which will available on the internet only and not in bookstores.	2001-05-31

I would consider this book, written in 1954, to be the most sobering book about nuclear war written to date.   The story is told in diary form, written by a missle technician only known as x-127.  The story starts out as the solider x-127 and 250 other soliders (men and women) head down deep into a underground bunker called Level 7.   The bunker is a immense system of tunnels and bunkers about 4000 ft underground.  Room enough for the buton pushers, engineers and scientist to continue our way of life after a nuclear holocaust strikes.  The mood of the story is grim, as X-127 realizes that once he makes the desent down into Level 7, there is no turning back to the outside world.  The government has deemed the soliders in the bunker the saviors of our way of life.  They have enough food, water, and air to last them 5 lifetimes.<br />Well, eventually it gets to a point where a war breaks out.  There are not descriptions of nuclear explosions, or firey death raining down on the populace's heads.  Instead the author portrays the war through the eyes of radar technicians and button pushers who only see blips on radar screens and are told via a loudspeaker on what buttons to push.<br />After the war, which is totally destructive.  Radiation spreads and wipes out life on the surface.  A clautrophobic life in a bunker becomes stiffeling for X-127 has he watches and listens to his fellow soliders start to loose it in a &quot;not so&quot; hermetically sealed bunker.<br />This story is very sad, and chilling.  The last paragraph of the story has to be the most riveting paragraph I've ever read.	2001-03-28

As a fan of post-appocalyptic fiction, I picked this book up on a recommendation from a fellow Amazonian. I was intrigued at the prospects of 2 teenages, Nell and Eva, trying to survive after the collapse of civillization, disease, hunger..etc.<br />Granted that about 2/3rds of the book deals with 2 normal everyday teenagers living with their parents in the boonies of Northern California. A war, economic depression, rampant plague or a combination thereof causes a collapse of the United States government. Nell and Eva loose their parents, the mother to cancer, and the father to improper use of a chainsaw. The 2 teenagers must survive on their own without any modern convience i.e.; supermarkets, electricity, running water..etc<br />It is only in the last 1/3rd of the story that we are treated to the brutality of the world that Nell and Eva now live in. Eva is raped by a passing transient while she was chopping wood. Okay, I was expecting this to happen in a story of this nature. Well, Nell, in trying to heal her sister, has sex with her?!?!<br />Hello? Did I just fall of the Earth? I have no clue to where the author came from with this scene. Granted in the entire scope of the book, it takes up a small percentage of the story, but kills any sympathy I have for the characters in exchange for disgust.<br />Granted Jean Hegland's writing is very moving, and she seems to have the making of a great story teller, but her choice of situations to expose her characters to are something to be desired. If the scene of incest was left out of the book, I would have given this story 5 stars with hopes that Amazon raise the scale higher so I could give this book more stars. Yet that scene with the sisters having incestual sex together? Nothing poetic about it.	2001-03-27

The story is really about a small band of people under the supervision of a college professor and a drunken bigoted outdoorsman.  Look at the outdoors man as a Archie Bunker on steroids.  The small band leave the rat race behind with the threat that civilization is soon going to meet an impending doom from pollutions, mismanagement of government, and high crime. They sell off all their posessions and hike off to the Great White North of the Canadian wilderness.  While stopping at different portages along the trail, the survivalist are picked off one at a time by some freak of nature, in the form of either a giant hawk,  frog or skunk (I'm not making this up). I'm guessing that this is Hugh's first book, since the character developement was left somewhere on the back burner along with a decent plot.  The situations where quite predictable, and by page 10 you figure out who in the group is going to be the &quot;bad guy that gets it in the end&quot;.  The thought of earth itself being the deadly antagonist was promising when mentioned on the back cover, but how the idea was handled within the book was very slipshod. Over all, the story the story stops short with a 2 page epilogue of what happens next.  Like the author didn't really know how to end this abysmal story. My recommendation is to skip this clunker.	2001-03-01

The Story:<br />After the Flood is set 33 years after a all out nuclear war practically wipes out humanity and civilization. The story takes place in 2032, somewhere in Scandinavia. The narrator and main character in the story is Edvin.  Born in a bomb shelter, and quite ignorant of the workings of the old world, the harelipped Edvin is a survivor. At the start of the novel, Edvin, is a 1st mate aboard a pirate ship.  He is used by the captain and crew as a sexual object, and abused considerably.  He is sent on a reconnaissance mission to a island for supplies, where he is then abandoned.<br />On the island Edvin meets Henry. Henry, who is dying of some sort of kidney discease (possibly brought on by a urinary tract infection) enslaves Edvin and uses him somewhat like a nurse.  The relationship is recipcated not with sexual favors, as the abused Edvin expects to be treated, but instead taught religion by Henry.  Edvin eventually meets a friend of Henry's called Petsamo.  Petsamo is a traveling doctor, of an ex-army medic with self study in the medical arts. He is basically  the closest you can get to a doctor in a world without any form of medicine or medical supplies. Petsamo is a cynic, who treats people the best way he can, which is mainly easing their suffering to the point of euthanasia.  Petsamo sets the tone for the story and its eventual outcome, as the world after this all out nuclear war is a harsh place where hope is almost non-existant, and the surviving people make no effort to rebuild the world that once was.<br />As a reader of post-appocalyptic fiction, I found this story very moving and cold.  Out of all the appocalyptic stories I've read, this story almost seems like a possible outcome of the unthinkable distruction that we as humankind could rain down upon ourselves.  The characters appear very old in the story, even Edvin, who is roughly 33 years of age in the story, appears to other almost as a old man.  The characters and situations are graphically horrible and ugly.  This is not light reading for the reader, like other post-appocalyptic stories ala &quot;Deathlands&quot;.<br />The actual meaning of the &quot;Flood&quot; is never really explored in this book. It could be surmised that a number of missles detonated near a fjord and caused a tidal wave that flooded the island, or that all the fallout caused a global warming the melted the icecaps and raised the sea level.  It is never really known for sure.   <br />After the Flood is translated from PC Jersild's original text. The book is regretfully out of print, but can be easily found in the public librar (that's how I got my copy).  I recommed this story greatly for those who like to read appocalyptic fiction.	2001-01-26

I'd recommed this book for the die-hard Survivor fan in a need of a fix until the January post Superbowl debute of Survivor II.<br />The book shed very little light on the behind the scenes that most viewers weren't aware were going on.  There were a few interesting tidbits on the history of the island, where the camera and production crews stayed on the island and interaction between crew, host, and castaways.<br />Burnett's &quot;Survivor&quot; reads like a journal, as he rehashes each episode from day 1 to day 39.   He reviews the survivorlist interactions with each other like a arthopologist would view a band of gorrilas.  Mind you there were a few insights into each contestant on this show, like the motivation behind BB and why he is the way he is. (his father was a overbearing perfectionist and expected his son to exceed in everything he did). Aside from the sparce revelations that Burnett has burried in this book,  Survivor doesn't cover much new ground. I found the book to be rushed, as Burnett and CBS were quick to pump this book out to capitalize on the quick burning flame of success that Survivor has become. This tribe has spoken!	2000-10-27

I felt as if I had entered the story <br />in the middle of  a situation that I new nothing about.  It felt like the story started  somewhere in the middle and <br />that I missed out in some previous  background history.  The story from there deals with mutants, pillaging,  rape, as the main characters of Thea and Evan search for a sanctuary.  Thea  and Evan move from situation to situation as they try to survive one  encounter after the other. The appocalypse, though never really explained  in any detail appears to be a series of events over a 30 year period, from  evironmental disasters, to chemical spills, to limited nuclear war.   As  quickly as the story starts, does it mysteriously end, as if the author  didn't really know how to end the story, or have some sort of conclusion  for the characters.  Like an elusive sanctuary, there is an elusive ending  to Yarbro's story.	2000-08-24

Pandora's Redoubt has alot going on in the story, but lacks the depth needed to flesh out characters and story.   The story starts off as Ryan and his band are in the mist of escaping a redoubt that is collapsing under  a torrent of lava.  The survivalist escape by the skin of their teeth to  another redoubt.  All is not well in this new redoubt as they discover they  are not alone.  Apparently raiders have invaded the redoubt.  After a brief  battle against some mutie dogs, Ryan and JB discover the raiders have been  building a gigantic tank that is dubbed &quot;Leviathan&quot;.  Being the  perfect vehicle to tour the new area the group has jumped into, Ryan and  Co. take Leviathan out for a spin.  In doing so, they a cybernetic battle  tank called &quot;Ranger&quot; that guards the redoubt and a city nearby.    After an intense battle the survivalist defeat the tank, but not without  risking damage to Leviathan.  Ryan decides to take Leviathan to the city in  hopes of finding a garage to inflict repairs.  Meanwhile, Ranger, not so  defeated as we are led to believe follows Leviathan to the city.  In the  city another battle ensues and Ryan manages to topple a building under  Ranger burying it.  Afterwards, the group stops at a gas station to look  for tools and parts to repair Leviathan.  While investigating the area,  Ryan and his son Dean come upon a woman being brutally raped by a bike  gang.  Ryan tells Dean that they cannot help, since their survival is more  important than helping the woman's.  Dean however disobeys, and in turn  help frees the woman.  The freedom comes with a unwelcome repayment as the  woman manages to knock out the entire group with a knock out gas.  The  woman, a heir to the nearby ville, wants the tank for herself to defeat the  Ranger that guards the city and redoubt.  Riches await in the city, and  dommination of Deathlands is her aspiration. What happens to Ryan and his  group?  Taken prisoner?  Tortured?  Someone put to death? You'll have to  read the book and find out...<br />Pros for reading Pandora's Redoubt:   <br />There is alot of action and gritty violence going on in the story.  Alot  of interesting characters and strange new technology are introduced.  The  Ranger tank was also a interesting antagonist in the story.  A benevolent  machine doing it's duty in protecting the redoubt and city, but unaware  that it's creators have wipped themselves out in the nukecaust.<br />Cons For  Pandora's Redoubt:  With everything that was introduced into the story  i.e.; characters and tech, there was little exploration into the how's and  why's on how things came to be. Why was the Ranger made?  What are it's  full capabilities?  The city covered in ivy, what advanced technology is  contained in the city? Also, what is up with Krysty?  It seems that the  writers for Deathlands are trying to make Krysty into some sort of  super-mutant with special powers.  In the last book, Krysty had this  ability to move had hyper-fast speeds.  In this book she has the ability to  infuse energy into people like a jolt of caffine for sleepy individual.  I  personally don't like how the character is being handled in this manner.  I  have a sick feeling that in upcoming books, Krysty will have more and more  powers.  I find these new powers to almost be silly and beyond what makes  up the character.  I hope they center more on the human side of Krysty  instead of the magical side.<br />All in all, Pandora's Redoubt is not a bad  book. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.   Recommended for the Deahtlands  fan. I look forward to the next Deathlands book: &quot;The Rat King&quot;  coming in September.	2000-06-29

I was interested in the background of a dreadfully overpopulated Earth, and a exploration to Earth's nearest neighbor Alpha Centauri.  I was expecting  some action, suspense, and some revelation.  Instead, I was treated to  severe boredom, nauseating sex scenes, incest, and assorted  perversions.<br />I was disappointed with time travel scanner, that allowed  the crew to observe alien life as it existed billions of years ago.  I felt  the time scanner device was out of place in the story as is the gross  sexual content that really didn't contribute to the story at all.  After  reading about 100 pages of the book, I decided to stick with it in hopes  that in some manner the story would become interesting.  In approach of the  last 50 pages with no action or suspense in sight, I wearily finished the  book with a lesson learned.  <br />What is that lesson you ask?   Stay away  from these 2 authors.  Hard to believe it took 2 people to write this book.  A real time waster.	2000-06-26

After the 5th and disastrous outing in &quot;Voice's Of Hope&quot;, I was a little skittish in picking up &quot;Patriarch's Hope&quot;.  Next time I should listen to  my intuition.    This is an exhaustive book with very little care towards  the supporting characters.   <br />The story is set in futuristic version of  19th century British Navy.  The Earth is collapsing environmentally under  the heavy industry that the Navy is putting forth to beef up their fleet.    Seafort, now Secretary General, leads his wife, friend, joeys, and middies  alike to certain and uncertain doom and demise.<br />I had alot of problems  with the book in the way the author has his supporting characters fawn over  Seafort and his every move and whim.   We're constantly treated to  Seafort's unbearable temper and devotion to the Navy and Lord God above.   It is with constant goading of &quot;Level it out middie!&quot; or &quot;2  demerits! No! 4 demerits! &quot; at anyone beneath him that crosses him  that racks on your nerves.  I can't understand why this guy has friends, or  why midshipmen would want to look up to this overbearing ogre.  <br />I agree  with the previous reviewer's comments about how Feintuch treats the female  characters in his books.  The females in his stories are either deranged  villains, insane wives, or helpless damsels in distress.   The universe in  Seafort's reality holds little in regards to a strong female or independent  woman. The pacing of &quot;Patriarch's Hope&quot; is also off.  There is  alot of flying around on Earth and discussion on the effects of the  military on the environment along with &quot;Belay that!&quot;,  &quot;Report to Mr. Tammarov for a canning&quot; to all the sniveling  unfortunate middies that cross this guy's path.  <br />It is only in the last  75 or so pages of the book that the action commences in such a pace that  you wonder if Seafort is ever going to catch his breath.  Thenovel ends  with the possibility of another sequel, which in all intents and purposes I  wish Feintuch would drop in favor of some other tale he could tell.	2000-05-18

The story starts off about 1000 years after a plague has wiped out most of humanity. The society has rebuilt itself into feudal-like  states.  The knowledge of the past and its workings have long been  forgotten.  All that is left are buildings, computers, and roads.  The  people of the world of the past are referred to as &quot;Roadmakers&quot;,  since the highways and streets are the only things left behind that are  intact and usable.  Since knowledge of the past is so valuable, ancient  books are worth more than a king's ransom.  Thus is the start of  &quot;Eternity Road.&quot;<br />The main character, Chaka Milano has inherited  a book from her deceased father.  Mark Twain's &quot;Connecticut Yankee In  King Arthur's Court&quot;.  The book is invaluable to the people in this  story since, in it leads to the question of  where did Chaka's father get  the book and are there anymore? Turns out that Chaka's father went on an  expedition to a almost mythical place called &quot;Haven&quot;.  A city  with fantastic sights, such as a dragon, ghosts and a wealth of Roadmaker  books.  Knowledge of the past, which would prove to be invaluable to the  people of the future. It is Knowledge of the things we consider mundane  that become almost magical to the  primitive people of &quot;Eternity  Road&quot;. The dragon for example is nothing more than a subway train or  commuter rail.  The train's long body and bright headlight take advantage  of the people's preconceived notion and lack of knowledge that the beast is  not a beast but a simple vehicle of mass transit. The disembodied voice  that greets Chaka and her companions at the train station is at first  mistaken for a ghost of a long dead Roadmaker is discovered to be in fact  an artificially intelligent computer that runs the rail system. You almost  grieve and marvel at the same time the loss of the wealth of information,  and the lack of know how by the people that have inherited the earth.  When Chaka visits a radio telescope array, she is greeted by the AI that  runs the SETI research.  The AI informs mistakes her for the professor that  is conduction the search for alien intelligent life.  Chaka is informed by  the AI in a matter of fact way, that the project has discovered 17 star  systems that have 'intelligent' signals from them.  A discovering that  would alter the way life is today, but to Chaka it means very little to her  and to her quest for Haven.<br />The characters and story are very moving to  almost poetic, but where McDevitt fails is in trying to end the story. The  constant and steady flow of the book comes to an abrupt ending has he hits  the breaks.  McDevitt finishes the story with a 2-page epilogue outlining  the lives of the characters.  It's a shame that the author chose to end the  story in this manner since there were many unanswered questions.  A sequel  was surely worthy of the book, but as too why McDevitt choose to hit the  skids is beyond me. I'd recommend this book, but only with a warning that  the story ends on a brief note.e lack of know how by the people that have inherited the earth.

The New Madrid fault is very real, and the last  time it errupted was back between 1811-1812.  8.9 on the richter scale.   Literaly liquifide solid earth.  It knocked down forests, and changed the  course of mighty rivers, in this case the Mississipi river.   &quot;The  Rift&quot; takes place in modern day America (today).

Omar's hatred of  all  that is not white anglo saxon protestant ignites after the quake hits  and he is cut off from the government.  He takes his hatred so far as to  imprison all of black people of the town in quasi-concentration like camps.   <br />Rev. Noble Frankland.  Fanatical Christian who forsees the coming of  the Tribulation aka: Judgement Day.  His visions become all to real to him  as he mistakes the quake and its aftershocks as the start of the 2nd  coming. He is the flip side of Omar Paxton, as he imprisons all that do not  kowtow to his sermons or his warped views on Christianity.  <br />Jason Adams.   The son of divorced parents.

Jason is pulled into a nightmare no child should ever go through as he  witnesses his mothers death to flooding brought on by the quake.  He is  practically orphaned as his father tries to push him on a distant relative  aunt in N.Y.<br />Nick Ruford.  A unemployeed African-American engineer  traveling to Lousiana to present a birthday gift to his daughter before she  takes off to school in France.  He and a friend are caught in the quake.   Nick goes from one tense situation to another as his traveling companion is  mistaken for a looter and killed, to getting caught in a ravaging flood of  the Mississipi.  He is saved by Jason, but only to fall into more dangerous  ground elsewhere in the story.  <br />General Jessica Frazetta.  Heads the  Army Corps Of Engineers.  She fights against the time, the quake, and a  emotionally and mentally impaired President Of The United States.  Up  against insurmountable odds as she deals with coordination a an enormous  relief effort, to say nothing about helping contain a critically damaged  nuclear reactor.<br />This is a fantastic piece of fiction, that depending on  wheither the New Madrid fault ever slips, could become a piece of  non-fiction.   I give this book the highest recommendations for summer  reading.	2000-05-12

Matter  of opinion I guess, but I found the humor in a pie fight lacking.  I really  don't think slapstick humor in Trek suits very well.  This is humor that  you'd see in a 3 Stooges episode, not Trek.   Only redeeming factor that I  enjoyed from the book is the Federation survey team that crash lands on the  planet.  I'm glad to see that not every starship, no matter what size, has  access to holodecks (yeah I know pre-generation), rec-decks, and libraries.

There they discover Mark Tomwun, a scientist working at The Institute of Peaceful Oceanographic Research.  The band of survilist soon discover that the work  that Tomwun is doing is not all that peaceful.  Tomwun is training dolphins  to kill. Particularly pirates that have been threatening the Insistute.  On  top of the killer dolphins, and the threatening pirates, there is also the  impending erruption of a volcano.  All this ties together in a lackluster  Deathlands story.  There are some exploration in a plot B side story  concerning Abe's search for the Trader, but only adds a teaser to the  reunion of Ryan, JB, and the Trader later on in the series. The Abe/Trader  side story almost seems like an after thought to try to beef up an  anti-climatic story.  I'd recommend this book only to a true fan of the  Deathlands series, but to someone who is just beginging to read these fine  books, I'd suggest passing on this adventure.	2000-04-12

The story deals soley with Dr. McCoy, has he is inadvertantly captured by Romulans and taken to Romulous.  McCoy is kept at a Romulan Cmdr's home  until he can be tried for his crimes against the empire.  While  incarcerated, he learns about Romulan history, which acts as the main story  in the book.  We learn about how the Romulans were the off shoots of  Vulcans, the dissention between Surak, and those Vulcans that didn't hold  Logic as the way out of Vulcan's bloody and violent past. The story opens  many doors into the minds of a little explored race in the Star Trek  universe.	2000-04-12

My only thoughts after reading 20 pages of this novels is, &quot;When is he going to write a sequel?&quot; Wolf's Hour is a definite pages turner and a book that is  almost impossible to put down.  A man with Lycanthropy.  The ability to  change at will from human to werewolf to a wolf.  The story has a plot A,  plot B storyline going on, where plot A deals with Peter on a spy mission  during WWII against the Nazis.  Plot B runs just about every other chapter,  and deals with how he shed his mortal human life for the life of a  werewolf. The book leaves itself open for a sequel, which I dearly hope the  author considers writing.	2000-04-12

As humanity dies out for the exception of a few bands of people that hold out in the city. Scavenging by day and hiding by night.  A small group of people come  together to fight the cause of the plague, and to save the few survivors  that are kept and bred like cattle by the head vampire.   A quasi &quot;I  Am Legend&quot; like novel with a almost spirtual like ending.  The book is  a page turner, and was my first introduction to Navarro's works.	2000-04-12

The idea of psychic vampires, who can control others with a thought.  A splendid mix of characters from a ex-nazi concentration camp commadant. A former Jewish  concentration camp survivor that dedicates his life to finding and brining  this man to justice as well as discovering the power the man holds on  others. A seedy, somewhat swarthy porn producer who's power is to make any  woman move and act to his slightest desire.  A long but enthralling book,  but worth the time to read.  I had a hard time putting the novel down.	2000-04-12

We learn the  events that happened as Doc was time trawled forward from the 1860's to the  year 1999 by the team of scientist for the Totality Concept. One scientist  being Dr. Silas Jamaisvous.  We learn about the torture that went through  Doc Tanner's mind has he is thrusted into a world completely different than  his own.  Then taken from this new worlds and thrusted again into the  future that is known as Deathlands.  Dark Emblem answers many questions on  why Doc is what he is. What the book lacks in action it makes up for in an  explorative story of an integral main character.	2000-04-12

I found the character, portrayed as their future selves, to be old haggard and somewhat cynical. Bruce Wayne/Batman forsakes his minimal violent approach for a more &quot;shoot first, ask questions  later&quot; approach. Gotham City is portrayed as a violent microcosm  compared to the violence and decay that exist as the USA fights a  Vietnam/Granada type war in Maltese Coro.  This is a book that exists on  many levels.  It's not Batman Vs. The Joker, or Batman Vs. The Mutants, but  Batman Vs The World.	2000-04-11

A less than entertaining post-apocalyptic book, that mixes post-nuclear war survivors with a Stephen King patriotic seer-like old woman.  Delves into time traveling quantum physics using of all things a Indian Shaman.   Guest appearances by a Civil War General, General Patton, and a dinosaur.    Seems like the author threw in everything but the kitchen sink in hopes  that he'd strike a cord with some sort of audience.  A real stinker of a  book.  If you're looking for post-apocalyptic reading material, then look  at Deathlands by James Axler.	2000-04-11

I have not had the honor to read any of the Honor Harrington novels, although my friend tells me they are on the &quot;must-read&quot; list. Apocalypse Troll starts off  promising, but quickly falls into a semi predictable fish-out of water  story mixed with Robin Cook's: Invasion storyline.  The characters were put  togher haphazardly and didn't command much from my attention as well as  feelings.  The book is good for a light read and I wouldn't rate it high on  my reading list.	2000-04-11

Your friend may be you enemy, and your enemy  just may turn out to be your friend. The story exemplifies the addage,  &quot;Politics makes strange bedfellows.&quot; I found the character of  Morgan Roche to be as engaging at Ellen Ripley character from Alien. A  strong enduring woman, who is an unwitting pawn in a grand scheme where the  reader is unsure as to who is pulling the strings. The culture is portrayed  in a richtapestry, where humanity exist in genetically modified caste  system. I recommed this book for anyone looking to get involved in a space  opera of a grand scale.  Only downfall is that once you finish Emgerence,  you're going to have to wait for the next book in the series to come out.	2000-04-11

Once you pick up this blockbuster of a space opera, it will be hard to put down.   Greene does an excellent job of stringing together  non-stop action with unusal characters, technology, and intriguing  villians. Downfall to this book are the sequels, which fail to hold much  attention as the 1st book.	2000-04-11
US	52534779	R1TARYE4AK5VSF	0812545486	491521082	Ignition	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Die Hard Lite	Not his best writing to date.  I would equate the story as a &quot;Die Hard Lite.&quot;   Half the action and suspense without all the calories.  I found the villian to be a regurtitated Hans-like villian ala Die Hard,  with all the gun toting half-cocked henchmen in tow.   The plot was  intriguing in holding the astronauts and space shuttle hostage. The story  fails in a predictable plot, a improbable hero, and tired ending.  I'd  recommend this book for beach reading only.	2000-04-11

Ryan and Co find themselves jumping to a redoubt in Arcadia National park in Maine. In exploring the forest of park, the band of post survivalist encounter a scientist working with pre-dark  (pre-nuclear war) technology for the most evil of purposes.  I particulary  enjoyed the author's exploration of the &quot;Failed Experiments&quot;  section of the facility that Ryan and Co visit.  Such grisly experiments as  2 sisters who have their heads joined on one body.  The 1st sister is  always promising to aphyxiate the other sister in her sleep.   There is  also the hunter locked in his cell.  Completely normal for the exception  that he has bear paws for hands. The books also explores some of the nature  behind the Mat-trans chamber, and the cryonics  that kept Mildred in  suspended animation during the nukecaust. The only failure in the story  would be the cloning experiments which create a duplicate Krysty. Naturally  a battle will insue.  Which Krysty will survive?  The original Krysty or  her doppenlanger? A fight that is lackluster and hardly climatic.  The  books saving grace is the in depth exploration of the horrors of genetic  manipulation that are performed on the unlucky few that stray too close to  the Cryonics facility. I'd rate this book a 3 out of 5.  Lotta of gritty  hard edge sci-fi, but fails at the end of the story.	2000-04-10

This book is broken down into a number of short stories with the same premise.  That is, a post apocalyptic explosion of vampires.  They rule our world.  They've enslaved mankind as their food source.  I found the story  of the freedom fighters in the antartic holding out against a military made  up entirely of vampires to be engaging.  The tired vampire colonel who  wishes to have the bloodshed stop was a great character that I wish could  have been explored more indepth. The stories are unique and show a mad  world where humanity is 'under the fang'.	2000-04-10

Out of all the titles that have come out since then, I find 'Shadow World' to be one of the most  entertaining.  The story starts off with Ryan Cawdow and crew escorting a  family through cannibal infested area. After getting involved with a  confrontation with one of the 'cannies' (cannibals), Ryan looses his  beloved Steyr rifle to one of the lunatics.  Ryan and Co then embark on a  vendetta for the loss of the family's father and for the retrieval of his  rifle.  At the same time these events are happening, a gateway opens in the  town of Moonboy.  The gateway unbenounced to the inhabitants of the town  leads to an alternate earth where the nuclear exchange never happend.   Instead a population time-bomb went off on that cold January day.  Now, in  the future this alternate earth has a staggering 100 billion inhabitance.   Through the gateway appear amored soliders who decimate the towns  inhabitants for the exception of one prospector who flees.  The prospector  runs to the next town, where entertains the inhabitants with the tales of  the soliders that appeared from this mysterious gateway.  The cannies  overhear this story and make a deal with the prospector to attack the  soliders and divy up the spoils (armor, laser rifles etc.)   As Ryan and  friends track the cannies to Moonboy, Ryan inadvertanly gets captured by  the soliders and taken away to a dredfully overpopluated earth. What does  Ryan learn about this strange new world? Does he ever return back to his  own reality? What happens to the cannies?  Read this entertaining book and  find out	2000-03-31
