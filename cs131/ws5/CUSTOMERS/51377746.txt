The concepts are tired (this is mere repackaging of 1987 material by a designer/design firm who is trying to drum up business). The writing is self-aggrandizing. This book could have been written in less than a three-page memo.     If you still speak with an arrogant dot.com era vernacular; if you enjoy using mantras like \\"recontextualizing the brand\\"; or if you enjoy hearing yourself breath, then you will thoroughly enjoy this book.     In the end, this book says a lot without saying anything at all. Buy something by Aaker (though he is a bit dated) instead.	2004-11-12

It is funny how everything is soooo wonderful during the Clinton years (the years of a Republican congress who fixed welfare, among other things) but now we have Bush to blame for everything that is wrong with America. Get over it, Paul. Socialism doesn't work which is what you continue to preach in your innumerable columns. I loved \\"Peddling Prosperity\\" it was great. During B-School we had the pleasure of dissecting and tearing apart your obvious pro-Socialist agenda. <br /> <br />Government programs need to be fixed and even eliminated in favor of more market driven programs. That's the truth. The FDR era did more damage to our current govt. structure than anything. This country will go bankrupt if these programs aren't radically reformed--even, eliminated. <br /> <br />Sorry, Paulie.

It has been proven over the last thirty years that the Muslim extremists have been trying to thwart any non-Muslim religion in favor of the whacky muslim way throughout various parts of the world: Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Chechnya, Bosnia, China.<br />I love the Moveon.org types who, as part of tactical campaigning and Kool-Aid drinking sessions, visit Amazon.com and write reviews without ever reading the books about which they write. It is clear several of the reviewers on this list are purely here to spread disiniformation. <BR> <br />Rabbitruns (the below reviewer) is a prominent leader in the Moveon.org effort who promotes such tactics.

Again, the songs contained on SNLJ2 are renditions of popular Japanese children's songs. Again, all of the words sung throughout are inaudible. While the accompanying workbook aids in comprehension, it isn't enough to get you through the painfully annoying vocals of SNLJ2. <br />In fact most of the songs contain screeching, skull-splitting vocals accompanied by low fidelity musical arrangements making listening to the songs unbearable. (My kids asked me to turn it off after one song). One cause (maybe): The songs sound if the only instruments being played are extremely primitive (e.g., pots and pans, washboards, zithers and the like) and the vocal quality is generally poor and grating at best. There are street vendors who can carry a better tune.<br />As a language instructor, I agree with the attempts that this series makes, but it is the execution that ultimately weakens this product. To be sure, there are much, much better ways to learn Japanese. I would recommend this title only as a last resort and after you've thoroughly exhausted traditional ways to learn Japanese.<br />The overall quality of SNLJ2 is exceptionally poor, the workbook is cheap, cheap, cheap and the audio is exceedingly horrible.

Save your money	This book has a \\"creative\\" (if not downright silly) approach, there is no doubt. However, I wouldn't advise using Heisig's back-of-the-napkin approach. Far too dated (this book came out in 1978), far too gimmick-y. You are better off buy something from Hiroko Storm, Michael Rowley or Peter X. Takahashi. This way, you know you are at least learning Japanese properly.	2003-07-15

If you'd like to learn Japanese effectively, properly and in a way that will allow you to grow as a student of Japanese, then don't buy this book. Save your money and instead buy something instead from Hiroko Storm, Peter X. Takahashi or the like. You'll be much smarter for it.	2003-03-11
