While I can appreciate the labor it must take to put a story in such format, I frankly find the poetics of it hard to read.  That makes the commentary (which is about half of this version) very helpful to people such as myself.  By reading the corresponding notes, I was better able to put the story together with the style, making for an exciting tale.  I would highly recommend this version to people who have difficulty deciphering Shakespeare's style.	2003-06-12

Naturally, at the time it was written, that was a valid threat, but now it is almost amusing to read such speculations about that particular superpower.  <br />This is a well written book that provides solid information that the end of time IS near.  I would recommend this to both Christians and non-Christians alike.	2003-06-12

I didn't, but it helps. Plot: a couple of Hutts get together and try to build a death star, with the help of the bio-re-engineered creator of the first two. (see, the emperor kept killing him, and re-creating him) Some Imperial Leaders reach an agreement to focus on the destruction of the \\"rebellion\\" It's a good book, and I think worthy of your time.	2003-06-03

This has about 10 stories in it, the last being of 4 parts, written by both master authors, Timothy Zahn(my personal favorite) and Michael A. Stackpole, a great author in his own right. This last tale takes up about 100 pages and is really good. In fact, Many of these tales are quite good. One is about a medic assisting a recue team at an Imperial prison, one describes how Mara Jade came into Talon Karrde's service, and the others are good too.

These bounty hunters are included: (they were all on screen in The Empire Strikes Back, when Vader had them come aboard Executor and breif them as to how the Millenium Falcon was to be captured, not destroyed.) Boba Fett, IG-88, Dengar, Bossk, and the team of 4-LOM and Zuckuss. IG-88's Tale is good, Dengar's tale is quite thick, almost painfull, Bossk's Tale is Okay, Boba Fett's Tale is interesting (it's all about him being in the Sarlacc) and Zuckuss and 4-LOM's tale is quite good.

This novel is set just hours after \\"Return of the Jedi\\" A group of super aliens (from outside Star Wars' Galaxy) have come to invade this outer world, Bakura. The Imperials and Rebels form a truce (which is held loosely on both ends) in order to prevent these aliens from entering the Star Wars Galaxy. I think this plot has been done, though (Earth forces team up to stop evil aliens?) and that detracts from the uniqueness of Star Wars. It is an okay book, but I've read better.	2003-06-03

Set five years after Return of the Jedi, this tale tells about the struggles of a new government (The New Republic) led by Mon Mothma. Grand Admiral Thrawn is the leader of the fleeting Empire, and proves that he, indeed is worthy of that title. He is cunning, and impressively intelligent, not wasteful of personell, quite opposite of the way Darth Vader would handle things. Talon Karrde, the successor to Jabba The Hutt's group is mentioned, and so is Mara Jade, as Karrde's sidekick. This is a great book, and mentions a Dark Jedi, Joruus C'baoth, a clone. It brings up several interesting ideas as tohow some things work. <br />I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE, EVERYONE, AND OTHER PEOPLE TOO<BR>So go read it, NOW!.	2003-06-03

Fun intergalactic entertainment!<br />Lando Calrissian and the MindHarp of Sharu <BR>Lando just got the Falcon, and has little ability as to how to fly it, you see, this is several years before A New Hope, and Lando is the only character you know of that will be mentioned of in these 3 books. He goes to a system, gets a droid, Vuffi Raa (Don't call me Master) and goes looking for treasure. He makes folks mad at him. This is one of my all-time favorites. The combination of Adventure, mirth, star Wars and Lando himself make this a great book. Read it, and may the Force be with you.<br />Lando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon<BR>Lando gets arrested. His punishment: deliver some goods, though he's not supposed to during the time when the Flamewind is occuring, making it dangerous. He cuts some deals, gets into trouble and gets away. It's good but not the best of the three. Read it anyway.<br />Lando Calrissian and the Starcave at Thonbaka <BR>This is very interesting. Several new concepts are introduced by this book. These creatures that live in vaccuum are very interesting. Lando begins to Learn how to control the Falcon. As You read on it gets better. He even gambles with these creatures. It's throughly well written and I think should be read by all who claim to have seen, heard of, or had anything to do with Star Wars.	2003-06-03

This is the last book in the trilogy (I should hope so, 'cause it's no. 3) And nothing to be scoffed at. Exciting doings occur and the conclusion offers many suprise outcomes. I'll give you one hint: Look closely at the cover. Luke has a BLUE lightsaber. That *hint* *hint* may or may not have something to do with one of them. The Noghri are an interesting group, and Leia provides them with insight as to why the New Republic is superior to the empire. This is a story that is indeed worthy enough to have the phrase Star Wars on the cover. I highly approve of this book for readers everywhere.	2003-06-03

This novel is set wedged between &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; A shorter book, than most of the other Star Wars Bantam Paperbacks, at just over 300 pages, but let that not draw away from this overly hyped book. It features such marketed characters as Dash Rendar, Prince Xizor, and the ASP Droid (several of them, actually). Most of the main characters are present in this tale, and it is very interesting, once you get past the first page (That's For you, Josh!). Dash is a Han Solo-like smuggler and Xizor is battling Vader for favortism in the Emperor's Eyes. Things progress, mighty dubiously, I must attest, and the space battles are well choreographed.

In addition, new leaders, like General Bel Iblis and and others. Lando is found in this book, too. It is very exciting and extremely well articulated by Mr. Zahn.

This book is divided into several short stories about various creatures that you saw lurking around Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi. Some memorable characters that are discussed are: Ephant Mon, Gartog, the dim-witted Gammorrean Guard (this one's hilarious), and Bib Fortuna. These are all kind of spooky, set in Jabba's dungean-like palace, but I've found that it was great to read in the winter(Minnesota Winter, which lasts for about 8 months, usually), because of the descriptions of the warm, hot, desert of Tattoine. This is a good collection of stories, and enjoyable to read.	2003-06-03

Clancy jumps around from one location and set of characters to the next, driving the reader on to get to the rest of the previous portion's story.  This helps solidify tense aspects and speed up slower sections.  This work is very entertaining as well as demonstrates how a lone ship had the potential during the cold war to stir up a plethora of panic.  Great military fiction.	2003-06-02

Wedge is setting up a new X-wing squadron, that is instead of Pilots that have commando capability, this squadron is comprised entirely of commandos that have pilot capability (they still do more flying than commando things, but act more as commandos. This is a really good book, if you can get over the fact that Wedge is the only person on this squadron that was mentioned in the previous four books. I think Mr. Allston showed a greater sense of humor and jovialness within his book, as opposed to Mr. Stackpole's subtle jokes. He also explores the trauma of being a pilot- losing friends in battle, and the mental struggles to overcome that. This is really a good book, and at 403 pages lasts a little longer than most Star Wars books.	2003-06-02

At first it seemed like a sorry excuse for a gift, but as I read this one first, I found that it was a challenging endeavor of the mind.  Lateral thinking, it seems, is taking a situation and finding a solution that is not the most obvious, but usually the most logical.  That said, this is challenging to say the least.  A good book for people who enjoy mind games.	2003-06-02

Isard (IceHeart) has captured Corran Horn. Tycho Celchu is on trial for spying. It's a mess, but exciting. This is one of the best books ever! All *stuff* breaks loose and it is very riveting. If you want to read a good book, this is it. (assuming you've read the previous two, they might help you grasp some of the basic concepts at hand)	2003-06-02

This book is basically a mother, undoubtedly upset with the unfortunate death of her daughter, trying to put a positive spin on her life.  It details all her struggles with different social groups and changing schools to make things better for her.  As to whether or not she actually said 'yes' I'm not sure.  I would give it the benefit of the doubt, but she apparently, by the details of her life, was not a very devout believer.	2003-06-02

This is the first book in the X-wing series, set 2 years after &quot;Return of the Jedi.&quot; It focuses on rebuilding the legendary Rogue Squadron (by, the way, in Star Wars: A New Hope {the book} there was no Rogue Squadron, it was known as Red Squad or Blue or something like that) rebuild after the fall of the Empire. Wedge Antilles and this Corran Horn guy make up a large portion of the plot though their are other pilots. In this book they go around on various missions in service to the New Republic.	2003-06-02

If you've read the first 6 books, you'll probably want to read this one, but be warned, its not real impressive.	2003-06-02

Having been to Frost a few months ago, I realize that the town has slowed since the 1950s into little more than a bedroom community where residents primarily work in (larger) neighboring towns.  Kittlesen presents an interesting account of what it was like growing up in a small rural village, where everybody knew everybody and life was much simpler, and it is presented in a familiar, slow paced fashion conducive to leisure reading.	2003-03-19

The author cites an example of some 'entity' pulling airplanes from time and space as we know it such as we would grab a ladybug from a bush and then replacing it, possibly infecting it with some parasite just as the planes became infected with Xenos.  The question it asks is that if we are not alone, who, or what, else is with us, causing this collision of worlds?	2003-03-19

Computer Organization deals primarily with the nuts and bolts of the hardware and how circuitry works.  Difficulties arose when the author talks about long since past data storage punch cards and the old IBM machines.  FORTRAN is used as the 'familiar' language for many examples, which becomes slightly confusing to new generation OOP programmers.  There's more than likely a better book about Computer Organization utilizing newer concepts, terminology and programming, but this makes for a good read into the history of computers.	2003-03-19

After an arduously prolonged development of a mystery, the book is nearly over.  The only factors it has going for it are an impressive use of vocabulary and it beats starring at a blank wall for entertainment.	2002-12-31

I really enjoyed Ender's Game for what it was, albeit somewhat sad.  This book is not like that.  Some of the characters have remained, but the context is all different.  Ender has lived another several thousand years at this point by traveling through space which slows down his actual aging.  The concern is about researchers in a small Catholic colony-planet and their research on the native creatures.  There are few meaningful events spurring on the reader which makes it drag along like a dying buffalo at times.	2002-12-31

Dr. Bierle's book is a curious collection of anecdotes and diagrams with little actual content.  While the book notes that he holds an M.A. and Ph.D in the life sciences, he also has a M.A. in New Testament Studies, which leads the reader to assume that all his conclusions are due to his scientific expertise.  However, many of his arguments are weak, although they are accompanied by bizarre, incoherent diagrams.  The copy of the book I have is a special edition printing by the Billy Graham Association, which lends the book some credit, but for the most part I found very little in the way of conclusive evidence to present to unbelievers.	2002-12-31
