I think she was definetly writing about her life but the part that is exaggerated was that her first film  was a huge success. hahaha. And the parts where she talks about being on set of her two shows were so boring, I couldn't wait to read past those parts. ps: She's a bit full of herself but who cares. It's a fun read.	2005-09-22

How Ben felt about himself and his symptoms of cerebral palsy were so true. I applaud the author on deciding to write about someone with cerebral palsy. This is a topic never touch on in fictional books. This story is great as in you get to see Ben mature as he gets with Stoner... But I hated how Stoner never really cared for him, she just used him basically and Spaz (Ben) knew that and kept rolling with it. He was that desperate for affection I suppose. I wish the story ended a different way, that is why I knock off two stars.	2004-11-09

The other stories are okay but the first and 'Rave' are worth a read. Sometimes I read the stories and wished for more, but most of the time I wished that FLB wrote with better grammer skills.

I hate how she can write about the same things over and over again in each book. Some times I feel like I read all her work in one book and thats it. I wish she'd expand her mind more and touch on different topics. In this one as well as the others she talks about anorexia, oleanders, sugary doughnuts, mermaids, and molestation. This story should be read by teenagers (15 and up) because the sex parts are graphic. I feel like we hardly got to know the narrator (Laurel) well enough. All she did was talk about her father and how her mother is crazy. She meets a man named Jack and they have sex. Her friend Claudia sounded interesting but no character development there. She just does drugs and alot of them. This book is good though if you've never read Ms. Block before. Read this and skip on Primavera and I was a teenage fairy!	2004-10-05

He had really crumby parents. For Gemma well her parents were just being a bit too protective over her. No need to run away, but she did a couple weeks after tar ran off. This book was excellent. I agreed with them, disagreed, felt bad for and nearly cried for them. They thought they could handle the world on their own but alas they could never because they weren't ADULTS yet. They didn't know between right and wrong. They thought they did but don't all kids think this way? All the characters in the book were lively and so interesting, even mister scholly who is a raging racist and hypocrite. The confusing parts about the book are you have to get used to the title at each different chapter. If it says Gemma , gemma is talking , if it says Tar on Top its Tar talking, if it says Richard.. get my drift ?
