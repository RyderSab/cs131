Lucky had left Dundee, Idaho six years ago, ready to be free of her mother's bad reputation and the hatred the citizens of Dundee held for her entire family.  She comes back to Dundee in an attempt to find her father, the father she has never known.  It doesn't take long for her to run into Mike Hill, her teenage crush - and member of the family who hates her the most.  She still has a crush on him, but it's hard to love someone who hates you because of who your mother was. <br /> <br />Mike Hill hated Red Caldwell for marrying his grandfather, Morris.  He hated it even more than Morris had left the Victorian house and a substantial amount of money to Lucky, Red's daughter.  Now Lucky's all grown up, and he can't help but find himself attracted to her.  With his parents hating Lucky with all they have, and most of the town backing up the Hills, Mike knows nothing can ever be allowed to develop between them.  Now, if only he could convince his heart of that. <br /> <br />I loved Brenda Novak's \\"A Family of Her Own,\\" and I was hoping that I would love this book just as much.  I wasn't disappointed.  I really felt for Lucky - she'd been through so much, and she had enough courage to return to a town where nearly everyone hated her just because of who her mother was.  I felt so bad for her sometimes, because behind the tough exterior she was a really nice girl - most people just didn't care to know that.  I was just rooting for Lucky the entire book, because with all of the hurt she had been through in her short life, she needed a happy ending in the book.  Mike was a pretty good character, too, and you definitely see the struggle he goes through, loving Lucky but loving his family as well.  This book definitely doesn't do the typical \\"small towns are pieces of heaven\\" routine.  This small town was vicious, people were hurtful and held on to grudges long after they shouldhave been let go.   <br /> <br />The only thing that I didn't like was - you never find out who Lucky's father is!  I suppose that is going to be revealed in the next book set in Dundee (\\"Stranger in Town,\\" coming out in May 2005).  With all of the emphasis placed upon Lucky's search for her father, I really think the author should have revealed who he was in this book.  Other than that, this was a great emotional romance that really tugged at the heartstrings.	2004-12-21

Ten years ago, Susan Monroe's heart was broken by Mac Conlon, a member of a secretive and highly trained unit called Charlie Squad.  She didn't realize at the time that it was a ruse, and she managed to get caught in the middle of a sting operation and was nearly killed.  Now, every day she looks at herself she's reminded of that - she has a scar along her neck, and her shattered knee joint doesn't let her dance or run any longer.  But when she sees the assassin once more, she knows that she has to get in contact with Charlie Squad - and she has to learn how to trust the man who had broken her heart all those years ago. <br /> <br />Mac hadn't wanted to break Susan's heart, but he'd been young and had followed orders as he had thought best possible.  He had been ordered to get Susan far away from the site where the bust would go down.  Trouble was, he hadn't figured that Susan would come charging into the middle of the sting and almost get killed.  Now, the assassin was back to finish the job, and Mac had to protect Susan better this time.  And even though he held himself responsible for Susan's wounds, could there possibly be another chance for them? <br /> <br />This book was really good, and earned a solid 5 star review in my opinion.  The action starts early in the book - the assassin makes his appearance a mere four pages into the book, and he's there pretty much throughout the entire story.  The action never really slowed down, either.  You'll feel your heart racing as Susan and Mac manage to once again elude the assassins, but you have to wonder how long their luck will hold out.   <br /> <br />The romantic tension starts as soon as the characters come in contact with one another, and honestly I read through this book wondering if the characters really could try again at their relationship (even though you know they will!) or if they would be unable to get past their mistakes.  Mac was a great character, definitely strong but sensitive enough to become a really likeable guy.  And the author definitely knew what she was writing about - enough technical detail to give you an idea of what is going on, but not enough to bore you.  And what a great balance of romance and action - it was great! <br /> <br />This is the third book in a series of sorts about Charlie Squad.  Captain Folly's book (first in the series) is called \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" and Tex's book (second in the series; Tex is Susan's brother) is \\"Line of Fire\\" (both by Cindy Dees).  I can't wait to read their books, and I'm looking forward to reading more about Charlie Squad!	2004-12-16

Meredith Malone was a woman who knew what tragedy and hardship were.  Her fiance dumped her as soon as he learned that she had breast cancer, but Meredith survived that obstacle.  She decided that she wanted to have a baby, but the donors got mixed up and she gave birth to a half-black, half-white baby girl.  She loves her baby, but her mother Jacqueline is not quite so accepting of the baby and encourages Meredith to give the baby up for adoption because people will think she had relations with a black man (that seems to be Jacqueline's biggest concern).  Offered an extended stay on the Oregon coast, Meredith takes the opportunity to get away - and meets the man of her dreams. <br /> <br />Justin Weber had lost his wife a few years ago in a freak accident.  Now he was a dedicated father to his two young boys, and he wasn't looking for a relationship.  As soon as he meets Meredith, however, his wounded heart seems to come alive, and soon they're in love with one another.  The couple has a lot to face, though - not only will Meredith's mother disapprove of the match because Justin is black, but Meredith finds it hard to trust him because of the hurt she experienced in her past.  Her faith in him will really be tested once she learns that he's the attorney for the clinic that mixed up the donors... <br /> <br />I usually don't judge a book by its cover, but that's what made me pick up this book in the first place.  I don't see a lot of interracial romance books, unfortunately, so this one immediately caught my eye.  The picture on the front is great - it looks real and loving.  And the story is what we have come to expect from the wonderful author, Cheryl St. John - one that creeps into your heart and touches your soul with its heartwarming characters and emotional depth.  I fell in love with Justin, Meredith, and the three children; honestly, I didn't want the book to end.  Ms. St. John deals with this interracial relationship in a respectful, touching way; and despite being a part of the Logan's Legacy series, is a great stand alone book.	2004-12-16

Rule #1 - don't get involved with a cop.  Even though most of her extended family were police officers, Patience had grown up with an emotionally distant, sometimes abusive cop for a father, and she didn't want to live like her mom had.  But when she confides in loner Brady Coltrane that she was being stalked, she found herself wanting to get to know the K-9 cop much better...    Brady Coltrane was a loner.  He didn't get involved.  The only living being he allowed himself to deeply care about was his partner, King, a German Shepherd.  But when Patience tells him that she's being stalked, he agrees to help her so her family won't get involved with the mess.  She thinks the stalker is harmless, but Brady knows better than that.  He knows how violence can destroy lives.  As Brady gets to know Patience a bit better, he feels the walls he constructed around his heart begin to crumble.  He thinks the noble thing to do is to walk away from Patience, but how can he do that with her stalker on the loose?    This book really deserves 4.5 stars.  It was shorter than it may first appear (the font was big and the lines were spaced wide), so it was a quick read.  It kept my interest from the first page all the way to the last.  Brady was a great hero, I just wish that his turmoil had been fully explored; instead, he appeared rather two-dimensional for part of the book because his emotions about what had happened in his past were never fully tapped.  I liked Patience and could identify with her.    The book didn't get five stars for two main reasons.  One, Brady's past wasn't treated with the depth I think it deserved.  Two, I knew who the stalker was as soon as he was introduced in the book.  So it was very frustrating to know who the stalker is, and yet the characters in the book had absolutely no idea who he was and were going down the wrong path for much of the story.  I wondered why neither of them could think a little harder and get to who was really sending Patience the flowers and spying on her.  Oh well.  It was still a great book, one that I'll probably read again, and I'm definitely interested in reading Patience's brother's story (\\"Internal Affair,\\" by the same author).	2004-12-13
US	23595366	R1YZQ495B1B1Y9	B0001OOUFG	994558302	Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper -- Case Closed	Books	2	13	16	N	N	The case isn't closed, no matter what the title says	While meandering through the library, I picked up a copy of this book.  The title interested me, so I checked it out.  I was expecting a pretty solid case since the author was claiming the case was closed, but I didn't find that.  Instead, a weak circumstantial case was presented, and I was left wondering how the author could have convinced herself that Sickert was Ripper, for she surely didn't convince me.    Ms. Cornwell is very fond of drifting far away from the topic at hand - she starts talking about how the bodies of the prostitutes weren't studied well, and ends up talking about a man who died on a toilet during her career, and she devotes a few pages to \\"The Elephant Man,\\" Joseph Merrick, who has absolutely no connection with either Sickert or the Ripper except they lived in England during the same time period.  Annoyingly enough, Ms. Cornwell pretty much uses \\"Sickert\\" and \\"Jack the Ripper\\" interchangeably, leaving me wondering how much of the information Cornwell presented about Sickert was factual, and how much was conjecture or something Jack the Ripper did.    Ms. Cornwell may be fond of going off in tangents, but she's even more fond of leaping to conclusions that have little, if any, basis in facts.  She knows that Sickert has a \\"fistula\\" that required three surgeries when he was a boy.  She believes the nephew of Sickert's third wife when he describes what the fistula is (honestly, how much could he have possibly known about Sickert's medical history and problems?  That just struck me as odd), and suddenly concludes that Sickert is a deformed psychopath (a word she loves to use, very frequently) who is unable to have relations with a woman, so he must kill and steal parts of prostitutes' organs because he wants to see what had brought his deformed self into this world.  Seriously.  And that's not the only leaps she made, either.    Ms. Cornwell put much emphasis on the Ripper letters.  Most people, including those who were working the investigation as it happened, discounted many of the Ripper letters as fake.  Cornwell believes that most of the Ripper letters are not hoaxes, but are mostly written by Jack the Ripper/Sickert.  There is no concrete evidence of this, although she does bring in a few experts to claim that she could be right (although other experts would disagree with them).  She just asks us to believe her.  Even if Sickert HAD written a Ripper letter or two, that wouldn't implicate him.  People write fake letters in high-profile cases all the time.  Remember the anthrax letter scare in the fall of 2001?  People sent fake anthrax letters in the mail.  Sure, they had very warped senses of \\"humor,\\" but come on, that doesn't mean they were responsible for the real letters.  In a similar vein, even IF Sickert had sent a Ripper letter in, that didn't make him Jack the Ripper.  In Ms. Cornwell's world, though, if Sickert sent in a Ripper letter, he HAD to be the Ripper.    Ms. Cornwell does not make much of an effort to convince the reader that Sickert is really Jack the Ripper.  Instead, she pretty much says that Sickert is Jack the Ripper, and spends several chapters trying to determine why Sickert did what he did.  The book read like a prosecutor's weak case - it would only take a moderately good defense lawyer to rip the case against Sickert to shreds.    It's obvious that she did a lot of research for this book.  I think the book does a pretty good job of painting a realistic, dismal picture of what life was like for the poor living in Victorian London.  She even raises a few interesting points about Sickert.  Maybe he is Jack the Ripper.  Maybe he's not.  Who knows?  At this point in time, I think it's virtually impossible to close this case.  And for Ms. Cornwell to state \\"Jack the Ripper...is caught\\" at the end of the book is ludicrous.  He's not caught, the case is not closed.  To claim otherwise, especially with such a weak circumstantial case, is pure nonsense.	2004-12-12

Roz Matthews knew what she wanted in life - she wanted to be her own woman, independent, and not tied down to a man she didn't love or want!  She had seen how painful love could be as she watched her parents' marriage self-destruct, and she didn't want any part of it.  She just wanted to be a spinster and become a journalist just like her father.  When she's abducted by a man she believes murdered her best friend's father, her first instinct is to flee at her first opportunity - but she is soon convinced that Eli isn't a guilty man, and she wants to clear his name. <br /> <br />Eli McCain doesn't fit into any world - he's half white, part Mexican, and part Cheyenne.  He's spent the last decade or so of his life wandering around from town to town, job to job, never putting down permanent roots.  Once he realizes that someone in Denver is framing him for murder, and that Roz may be killed because she may have seen too much, he abducts her for her own good.  As he travels with her towards his adoptive father's cabin, though, he can't help but feel forbidden feelings for her.  He may love her, but he'll have to leave her. <br /> <br />I thought this book sounded good, and it did have its moments.  I found myself laughing aloud a few times, and the first few chapters held my interest.  But after the first few chapters, the first half of the book was primarily devoted towards Eli and Roz's lust for one another.  Seriously, much of the interaction between Roz and Eli was Roz trying to convince Eli to sleep with her and Eli trying to convince himself and Roz that he shouldn't.  Of course, you know what happens.  After that was resolved, the next half of the book was dedicated to an overly complicated, long, drawn out, and silly (at times) hunt for who was setting up Eli for murder.  Roz, for being portrayed as a smart character, could be dense, and the independent beauty we saw in the first few chapters became a rather submissive and subdued woman who couldn't function without Eli around.  I didn't care for Roz in the slightest, Eli was okay.   <br /> <br />I just expect more out of Ms. Finch than this.  I've read books by her before, and I was always drawn to them, but this just seemed below her usual writing level.  The book was so predictable and I really had to work hard to finish this one.  Hopefully her next book will be better.	2004-12-12

Not only are some of the charts designed for cross stitch, but many are also easy to convert to cross stitch if needlepoint is not your forte (such as it is with me).  There are several dragons (including blackwork), unicorns, sea serpents, and fairy beings. <br /> <br />The gem of this book, however, is the Mythical Character Alphabet sampler.  From Anubis and Basilisk to Yama and Zeus, each letter has a fantasy animal or being attached to it.  I'd never heard of some of them - a Wyvern, a Re, and a Karkadann, just to name a few.  It obviously took a lot of research and work to chart each of these.  The color photo of the finished project is gorgeous.  The beautiful Dragon of the Sea picture is wonderful too. <br /> <br />The book has a lot of features - instructions for beginners, finishing techniques, descriptions of the materials you'll use, etc.  Most are charted with DMC floss, but some use Persian yarn and DMC perle cotton.  Many of the charts come with small descriptions of what inspired the artist to chart the graphs, and what cultures the creatures are from.   <br /> <br />The two problems I have with this book: <br /> <br />1.  The graphs are way too small to see well.  Many of the charts' symbols are so small, I have to lean really close to the page to figure out what they are.   <br /> <br />2.  Some of the \\"charts\\" are really patterns you have to transfer to what you want to stitch on, and then do some guessing from there.  I don't know how to do that.  The blackwork patterns are especially disappointing - the blackwork dragon isn't charted out at all, and you are pretty much left on your own to figure out how you are supposed to get his outline onto the fabric, and then fill him in. <br /> <br />Still, the book has a lot of good patterns that are charted decently enough.  Although I wouldn't recommend the book for a complete novice, some of the smaller patterns areeasy enough for a beginner, and none of the charts are very complicated (some of them are quite big when finished, though!).	2004-12-11

Small-town veterinarian Maisie McDowell couldn't believe it when she was told by Doctor James Sutherland (who is also her new neighbor) that she was pregnant.  The tests proved his diagnosis was correct, however, and Maisie is left wondering what she is going to do now that a baby is on the way.  Worse still, she can't fight the growing attraction for James, but when she's carrying another man's baby, how could she possibly pursue a relationship with James? <br /> <br />James Sutherland was attracted to Maisie as soon as he first saw her, but after he diagnoses her unexpected pregnancy, he is determined to put Maisie and her baby's feelings and needs before his own.  So he'll help Maisie as much as he can through this pregnancy - while secretly wishing that she was his wife and she was pregnant with his child! <br /> <br />I was greatly disturbed by the rather blase treatment of the conditions under which Maisie got pregnant.  Her friend suggested that Maisie go to counseling, but Maisie didn't think it necessary because she had a few heart-to-heart chats with James.  And once Maisie figures out how she got pregnant and who the father was, her main concern was expressing that her baby's father had good genetic material!  What?!?  After she's been through all of that, she's concerned about telling James that her baby had good genetic material, as if that downplays what happened to her?  Having lived through something similar to Maisie's situation, I can say for certain that you cannot just brush it off and expect to keep your mental health.  If Maisie was a real person, I would be very concerned about her, because you can't just repress everything like that.   <br /> <br />Since Maisie's reaction was just so wooden and unrealistic, I never got attached to her character at all.  James was a bit more likeable, but he eventually bought into Maisie's beliefs that everything was just ducky with this pregnancy and the circumstances surrounding it.  The pieces just fell together, the loose ends were tied neatly, and left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  I just cannot believe that Maisie was just so calm about everything.  Ick!  Skip this one, it's not worth your time.	2004-12-06

She's attracted to him, but it's almost as if he's afraid to admit that he's attracted to anyone, because of his wheelchair.   <br /> <br />The story was pretty good until it came to the end.  There was no ending!  At least, there was not a satisfactory ending at all.  There was no commitment at all.  Sex does not equal commitment.  Ryan was doubting entering into a relationship at the end, so who knows if the characters ended up together or not.  If the author had bothered writing an ending for this story, the story would have gotten a higher rating. <br /> <br />\\"Maybe This Christmas\\" by Jane Blackwood - 5+ stars <br /> <br />Ever wish that you could go back in your life and relive an important moment to change its outcome?  Laura Randall sure does.  We first meet Laura when she is an old woman, dying in the hospital and regretting her life and the mess she made of her children's lives.  Her hospital roomie asks her if she'd like to go back and change things, and magically Laura is young again, still married, and her children still love her.  Laura only has until Christmas Eve to recapture the love she and her husband once shared. <br /> <br />This was really the only story worth reading in this anthology.  Oh, this story was so good!  This is probably the best romantic short story I've ever read.  It was so emotional and heart-stirring, I didn't want it to end. <br /> <br />\\"The 24 Days of Christmas\\" by Linda Lael Miller - 3.5 stars <br /> <br />Addie Hutton returned to her hometown after a scandal destroyed her journalism career.  Frank Rayner, her former fiance and now a widowed father, offers to let her live in a house on his property for free.  As Addie's step-son and Frank's daughter become friends, Frank and Addie realize that their feelings for one another were still alive. <br /> <br />I think I may have enjoyed this story more had it not been placed after such a warm, emotional romantic story.  But since it was, it seemed to fall flat.  I didn't get attached to Addie or Frank.  This story was fluffy and nice enough, but didn't pack an emotional punch like the previous story. <br /> <br />\\"A Bright Red Ribbon\\" by Fern Michaels - 2 stars <br /> <br />Morgan Ames, a surprisingly childish 29 year old, had been waiting for two years for her ex-boyfriend to propose to her.  He had dumped her on Christmas Eve, but had promised to propose to her two years later if he felt they were meant to be together.  But as Mo tries to return home, she is stranded in a blizzard, rescued by a dog, and holes up with Marcus Bishop.  Mo begins to wonder if she really wants Keith to propose to her after all. <br /> <br />This story was the worst of the four.  Not only is Morgan incredibly childish (waiting TWO YEARS for her ex-boyfriend to come back to her, with no word at all from him, and knowing that he's sleeping with other women?!), but the characters just seemed incredibly flat.  Mo and Marcus were in love with one another, although they didn't even know one another.  During the year, they had probably spent less than 48 hours in one another's company, but it was true love for both of them.  Yeah, right.  Something with the author's writing style didn't click with me - the characters talked a LOT, and there was little description of their feelings or the situation.  The characters just didn't talk - they rambled without rhyme or reason.   <br /> <br />So, in brief, the only story worth its salt is \\"Maybe This Christmas\\" by Jane Blackwood.	2004-12-02

French model Xandra Fortune's world came crashing down in a matter of hours.  Her lover, Dimitri Petronides, dumps her because he is going to marry another woman, evicts her from their apartment, and denies that he is the father of her child.  Heartbroken, Xandra leaves Paris and her modeling career behind, and becomes plain old Alexandra Dupree once more.  She doesn't think that she'll ever see the man she loves again - until he shows up at her sister's house, offering marriage!    Dimitri knew he had made a horrible mistake when he threw Xandra out of his life, all in a misguided attempt to appease his ill grandfather.  As soon as Xandra leaves Paris, he attempts to find her, but he searches for months and comes up with nothing.  It's not until fate, and a little help from Xandra's brother-in-law, brings them together again that he realizes he can't allow Alexandra to leave again.  He wants her, he wants their son, and he'll do just about anything to keep them in his life!    Although the little summary on the back of the book intrigued me, I didn't really think I'd like this book too well.  Specifically, I didn't think I would like the character of Dimitri, throwing out his pregnant lover so he could marry someone else.  But it didn't take me long to realize that there was so much more going on here than meets the eye.  There's Dimitri's childhood, his perceptions of love, his grandfather's illness, and emotions that he can't put a name to.  There's also Alexandra's belief that love is always conditional, that she must protect herself from being hurt, and that no one will really want her for herself.      There is not a saint in this book - the characters are both flawed, but the reader grows to love them both in spite of those flaws (or, maybe even because of them).  The author manages to weave together such a convincing, wonderful romance full of ups and downs, promises and disappointments, that you can't help but fall under the author's spell.  What an incredible, emotional book - I didn't want to put it down, and when I finally finished, I immediately wanted to read it again.  This book deserves more than 5 stars, and is a wonderful tale of second chances.	2004-11-29
US	23595366	R1EAR7XL8GL02F	0373750455	224079236	Burning Bright	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Three winter holiday romances	This book was fairly unusual - each of the stories was set in a different religious context with each of the main female characters celebrating a different winter holiday.  Each story took place in Crescent Cove, Vermont, a small town with love in the air!  I'll review each story separately. <br /> <br />\\"Star Light, Star Bright\\" by Anne Stuart - 4.5 stars <br /> <br />Angela McKenna is back in Crescent Cove after a painful divorce, and soon finds that Brody Jackson is also back in Crescent Cove after a financial scandal.  Brody had had a crush on her when they were both teenagers, but Angela had married her childhood sweetheart and moved away.  Once Brody sees Angela again, he realizes that he still has a crush on her, and Angela wonders why she was so blind when it came to Brody in the first place.  Can a little Christmas magic bring Brody and Angela together? <br /> <br />This story was really good and laid down the foundation for the next two stories by introducing a lot of the town's places and residents.  I don't have much to say about it - it was a good \\"second chance at finding love\\" story.  My only complaint is that the character of Brody wasn't developed as well as he could have been, but there's always limited space in short stories. <br /> <br />\\"Return of the Light\\" by Maggie Shayne - 5 stars <br /> <br />Dori Stewart thought she had it all - a job she loved, a great salary, and a wonderful apartment.  The publishing house she worked at was acquired by a conservative publishing house, though, and she found herself fired for her religious beliefs (although the new company cleverly disguised this fact) because she was a practicing Wiccan.  Dori went back to Crescent Cove, where she met Jason Farrar, her old boyfriend.  She had left Jason behind years ago for the big city, but Jason had never forgotten her.  In fact, he still loved her madly - but he wasn't going to get his heart broken by her again.  As Dori tries to reignite her waning faith this wintersolstice, will she come to the conclusion that she was meant to return to Crescent Cove because she and Jason are destined to be together? <br /> <br />I absolutely loved this story, it was the real gem of the book (although the other two stories were good too).  Not only does Ms. Shayne manage to create two endearing characters in less than 100 pages, but she also accurately portrays the struggles of a pagan trying to fight against the stereotypes so many have against the faith.  It was a wonderful story, I absolutely loved it.  The letter Ms. Shayne wrote that appears before the story is also great - don't skip over it! <br /> <br />\\"One for Each Night\\" by Judith Arnold - 4.5 stars <br /> <br />Alana Ross is instantly attracted to big-city lawyer Jeffrey Barrett.  Too bad he's in town trying to clear his uncle's name, a man Alana believes is guilty of stealing money from the school budget.  Although they're adversaries, they can't deny the chemistry between them, especially as Jeffrey helps Alana prepare for hosting her first Hanukkah open house.  Can Jeffrey and Alana forget the circumstances keeping them apart and focus on what could draw them together? <br /> <br />This was also an enjoyable story.  Much of the story focuses on the mystery of the missing funds - did Jeffery's uncle take the money or not?  I was left wondering until the truth came out.  Each of the three stories also provide details about the faith of the main female character, so I learned things about the pagan and Jewish faiths (I already knew Christian beliefs, having been raised a Catholic).  This is definitely a great book for anyone who loves a winter-themed romance, regardless of their faith.	2004-11-21

Jessica Trent had come to Paris with one mission in mind - to save her inept brother, Bertie, from the hedonistic lifestyle that was leading him straight to bankruptcy.  She holds his friend, the infamous Marquess of Dain, responsible for Bertie's decline, and she is determined to put a stop to it.  But she's not prepared for the overwhelming attraction she feels for Dain, despite his attempts to remain aloof from her.  Still, marriage isn't exactly what's on her mind - until her reputation is compromised, and he offers to wed her. <br /> <br />Sebastian Ballister, Marquess of Dain, had had a rough life.  His father was a cruel man who never liked his \\"ugly\\" child.  His mother ran away with a shipping magnate and died in the West Indies of a fever.  Once his mother died, he was sent away to a boarding school where the other boys constantly ridiculed his looks, his coloring, his nose, and his mother's infidelity.  Sebastian learned to harden himself against the world, especially against feminine wiles.  He couldn't even hope that a lady would want to marry him for himself - until he finds himself tempted beyond belief by Jessica. <br /> <br />This book was so good, I literally could not put it down.  This is an unusual romance, as another reviewer mentioned, because the circumstances keeping the hero and heroine apart are so realistic.  There is no Big Misunderstanding that would be resolved if the characters only talked with one another.  There is only Dain's horrid childhood, memories and experiences that still cloud his vision of the present, and affect how he interprets circumstances.  He truly believes he is ugly, and that no one wants him for himself.  This was drilled into him by his cold father, his peers, and his mother's abandonment.  So when Jessica shows tender feelings for him, not only does he not know how to react, but he is suspicious of her.  Watching them work through this was an amazing journey.  Jessica was just the right type of heroine for him -strong enough to stand up to his demons and challenge them.  I imagine that I will read this book several more times.  Definitely a keeper!	2004-11-16

After losing his brother because of Nathaniel Wylde, an infamous pirate, Stuart has finally tracked down, captured, and watched Wylde hang for his crimes.  After one more trip to the Barbados, Stuart expects to retire to his family estate, find a wife, and have children.  While on his last trip to the Barbados, he finds a woman who is as beautiful as she is spirited - Cassandra Everson.  He marries her quickly, and is happy to have found such a woman to be his wife - until he learns who she really is. <br /> <br />Cassandra Everson knew that her father, Nathaniel Wylde, was a notorious pirate, but she couldn't help but love him.  After watching him hang, she is determined to leave London and those who scorn her because she is Wylde's daughter.  She helps steal Wylde's impounded boat and cuts down Wylde's body, both of which are crimes in England, and sails to Barbados with her father's former crew to visit her guardian, John.  While in Barbados, she meets the dashing Captain Marston, and soon finds herself in love with him.  Although she believes she should tell Stuart about her father, she has no idea the role her father had played in the death of Stuart's brother, nor the role Stuart played in the death of her father.  But once Stuart finds out who Cassandra is, he is enraged.  How could he have married the daughter of his arch nemesis? <br /> <br />For those readers who like romantic pirate heroes, this isn't the book for you.  The pirates in this book are villains, no matter how dashing and charming they may be at times.  The author emphasizes this several times - pirates are murderers, thieves, and whatnot; and I must say, that is far more realistic than the dashing pirate heroes who often appear in romance novels.   <br /> <br />I thought the book was okay.  Cassandra was quite spirited and independent - until she married Stuart.  Then she just became a weeping mass of hysteria for most of the passageback to England.  Her character totally changes, and it's not a good change.  They fell \\"in love\\" with one another way too quickly - Stuart has spent less than a few hours in her company but is already proposing marriage?  And Cassandra swears up and down that she is in love with Stuart once they are married, but then she keeps saying that Stuart is such a stranger to her, she's not sure what he'll do or what he'll say, or even how he is feeling.  Stuart also blames Cassandra for her father's crimes, nevermind that she had no knowledge of them and played no part in them.  Even worse, Stuart just couldn't forgive Cassandra because her father killed his brother (and Cassandra didn't play any role in his brother's death), but Cassandra had apparently forgiven Stuart of his role in her father's death in less than a minute (and Stuart was pretty much responsible for his death, since he brought him back to England to be hanged).   <br /> <br />The author's style of writing seemed disjointed and time didn't flow smoothly.  Mere moments would stretch for pages and pages, and then weeks would fly by with only a paragraph or two.  Transitions were pretty much non-existent between scenes - the author just stopped at one paragraph, there was a space, and another scene was started, with no transition or explanation.  This could be quite confusing at times.   <br /> <br />I have read another book by this author, and must say I'm disappointed in this one.  It started out good, but after Stuart and Cassandra's rushed declarations of love, I just couldn't stay involved with the story, especially since much of it was spent with the main characters arguing and Cassandra weeping.  I can't say I recommend this book - hopefully her next will be better.	2004-11-13

She had been ruined in the eyes of her family four years ago, and she was kept away from most Society events by her overbearing brother and waspish sister-in-law.  But when Lord Wyatt's sister runs away to elope with a most unsuitable man, Sophia finds herself traveling along with Hal in search of his sister.  Along the way, Sophia's feelings for Hal only grow, but she knows that since she is already ruined, he'll never look at her with any more intent than making her his mistress. <br /> <br />Lord Hal Wyatt has found himself in an incredible jam.  Not only is his sister running off to Gretna Green with a disgraceful man, but he knows that he'll be duty-bound to marry Sophia, since she wasn't really ruined at all.  His sense of honor demands that he do the right thing by her, but as he gets to know the enigmatic woman along the trip, he realizes that it will be no hardship at all to marry this charming young lady.  Still, Sophia won't settle for anything less than love, and she'll rebel every step of the way until she has it. <br /> <br />This book was pretty good.  It started off very well.  I was instantly drawn into the story, and caught myself laughing out loud several times as I was reading the first few chapters.  Hal seemed like a very likable hero - at first.  After he decides that he must marry Sophia, he had a complete change of personality and became more possessive, more angry, and more disagreeable.  He eventually reverts to the normal Hal, but while he was acting unlike himself my heart hurt for Sophia, who loved him but didn't want to marry him out of duty or honor.  Still, all's well that ends well, I suppose. <br /> <br />One peeve of mine that I noticed several times in this book - the author introduced a plot element but never finished it, so the reader is left with questions at the end of the book.  For example, Hal continually referred to himself as a \\"reformed rake,\\" but there was some doubt to his claim; however, it was never explained if he was just trying to charm Sophia or he was telling the truth.  Another time, Hal may or may not have slept with a prostitute while he was traveling with Sophia.  Sophia is understandably upset, but the reader is never told whether he actually did, or if Sophia was wrong in thinking that he had.  Not finishing up things like that bothers me.   <br /> <br />There was nothing exceptionally extraordinary about this book, but it was an engaging read and I enjoyed it.	2004-11-12

It wasn't until she met Anton, Lord Wraith, at the altar that she saw why - his face was marred by a hideous scar (and his temper is hideous, too, as we soon learn).  Still, Rosina is determined to make this marriage work.      Okay, sounded good at first to me.  I love regency romances and I have a thing for wounded men.  Lord Wraith, however, was a totally unlikable character.  He really should have been named Lord Wrath, for he was constantly lashing out at Rosina, saying some very hurtful things.  He had his tender moments, but those are hard to appreciate when he's constantly switching back and forth from devoted husband, to casual indifference, to downright cruelty.  His temper turned on a whim, and poor Rosina never knew when he'd strike out at her.    There was also an overtone of violence that I absolutely did NOT appreciate.  A few times, Anton mentioned that he should beat Rosina.  Another time, he grabbed her wrist so hard that he injured her and bruised her wrist.  And worst of all, when he was particularly angry at her, he wrapped his hands around Rosina's throat and told her how easy it would be for him to choke the life out of her.  Tender hero?  I think not!  And his behavior did not improve as the book went on!    The blurb on the back of the book was also quite misleading.  Sure, Anton's scars and insecurities played a big role in the book (especially the first third), but that wasn't the main plot in the book.  Much of the book was devoted towards Anton desperately trying to figure out if Rosina was truly a virgin or not.  Nevermind that he talked to her about his going ons with prostitutes (at the dinner table, no less!), if Rosina was anything less than a virgin, he didn't want her (even if she had been raped).  Upon deducing from her actions that she had suffered some sort of sexual trauma in her past, he was lessconcerned with Rosina's feelings and more concerned about finding out what had happened and who had done it.  In the process of trying to find out what had happened to Rosina, he called her vile names, insulted her terribly, and spied behind her back.  Ick.  If he couldn't be Rosina's first, he was determined to destroy her...and he nearly did.  And it didn't matter what Rosina said to him, because he wouldn't believe her anyway.  Instead, he thought to get the truth from the men he thought had abused her?  Yeah, sounds like a plan to me.    Usually, I am always rooting for the heroine to get with the hero, but in this book I was sincerely hoping Rosina would not end up with Anton in the end.  He was a cruel, abusive man, and this \\"romance\\" was nothing more than a glorification of an abusive relationship.  You had Anton, an abuse victim who grew up to be an abuser, and Rosina, who had been abused and so love-starved that she grew to love her abuser.  That is definitely not what I want to read in a romance novel.  This book was painful to read, and I kept hoping it would get better - sad to say, it kept getting worse as time wore on.	2004-11-09

I love Christmas-themed romances, and this one was pretty good.  I rated each story for four stars, but will review them individually. <br /> <br />\\"A Heavenly Christmas\\" by Carole Mortimer <br /> <br />Olivia Hardy had spent the last ten years of her life trying to forget her past, Christmas, and anything remotely emotional.  So when her upstairs neighbor, good-looking Ethan Sherbourne, gets a baby practically dumped into his lap a few days before Christmas, she doesn't want to care.  She thinks that Ethan is the father of the baby, and that the baby's mother is one of the parade of girls that go into Ethan's apartment.  As Ethan, Olivia, and baby Andrea spend time together over Christmas, however, both Ethan and Olivia realize that there is more than meets the eye about the other. <br /> <br />This story was okay, four star material.  Mrs. Heavenly and Faith got on my nerves, the angels could have been left out entirely of the story.  There were a few Big Misunderstandings keeping the hero and heroine apart, and if they had bothered to ask questions instead of just assuming things, they would have sorted out the stuff much quicker.  It was a good romance, but a little too annoying for my tastes. <br /> <br />\\"Christmas Passions\\" by Catherine Spencer <br /> <br />Ava Sorensen, a nurse who currently worked in Africa, is returning home for Christmas for the first time in three years.  She can't wait to see her best friend, Deenie, even though Deenie is practically engaged to the man Ava had had a crush on for years, Leo Ferrante.  But when Ava sees Leo and has to spend a night with him stranded in a barn, the feelings she thought to suppress come to the surface once more.  But Ava is torn between her friendship with Deenie and her passion for Leo - can there be any reconciliation? <br /> <br />This one, I didn't really know what to make of it.  On the one hand, it was pretty despicable that Ava was going around kissing her friend's supposed fiance, even though she kept telling him to leave her alone.  But, on the other hand, things weren't exactly what they seemed.  It was a good romance, but I couldn't completely get over the repulsion I felt for making moves on your best friend's man. <br /> <br />\\"A Seasonal Secret\\" by Diana Hamilton <br /> <br />Beth Hayley had loved Carl Forsythe since she was a young girl, but she knew that she was way out of his league.  So, when she found herself pregnant, she thought she'd do the right thing and not tell him.  Now, eight years later, Carl has returned to Bewley Hall to take care of his late uncle's estate.  Newly divorced and bitter, Carl runs into Beth - and her little secret.   <br /> <br />This one was predictable, as expected.  There's only so many ways one can render the \\"secret baby\\" plot.  Still, it was fairly good.  Carl was a pretty good hero, even though he was (justifiably!) angry in much of the story.  Beth was noble in motives, even though she was wrong in keeping the pregnancy from Carl.  It earned four stars in my book.	2004-11-09

Although Marcus, the Earl of Rutherford, is a confirmed bachelor and a most notorious rake, he knows that he must resign himself to marriage in order to produce an heir.  His current air, his cousin, has no desire to become a duke, and would rather spend his time in scholarly pursuits than the duties of a duke.  So Marcus, intent on marrying someone just as cynical and hardened as himself, decides to propose a marriage of convenience to a widow with a dubious reputation, his mistress.  But before he can do so, he is called out of town to settle his dead great-uncle's estates - and returns to London with a wife! <br /> <br />Miss Marguerite Fellowes had spent her life suffering from the scandal of her parents' deaths, always the unwanted relation.  When Marcus comes, she is near death from influenza, and because Marcus nurses her back to health, her reputation is in shambles and no one will want to employ her again.  So when Marcus proposes a marriage of convenience to her, she accepts, but soon discovers there is a vast difference between Marcus, the private person, and the Earl of Rutherford, his public personality.  <br /> <br />I read this book directly after reading \\"The Unexpected Bride\\" by the same author, and quickly realized that the plot was virtually the same, with a few minor alterations here and there.  That was a bit disappointing, since the plot of the former book was still fresh in my mind.  Still, I did enjoy this book, but not as much as I probably would have had I waited to read it.   <br /> <br />As mentioned by another reviewer, all of the disagreements between the hero and heroine could have probably been solved by a long talk, but after learning more about Meg and Marcus's childhoods and personalities, the occurrence of such a talk looked pretty remote unless extenuating circumstances forced them to come clean to one another.  I didn't understand Sir Winterborne's fascination with desiring to harm Meg, nor did I understand why Winterborne was so hateful towards Marcus.  An explanation was eventually given, but it wasn't a credible one in my view.  Also, Marcus' tendency to distance himself from his emotions was never adequately explained for my liking.  Oh well, this book was still pretty good, and I'd probably read it again.	2004-11-08

Sylvan Miles had danced with Lord Rand Malkin once, before her reputation was in complete tatters and before Rand was wounded on the battlefield and left confined in a wheelchair.  So when Rand's brother, Gavin, convinces her to become Rand's nurse, she is expecting a physically and emotionally broken man.  Instead, she finds Rand more than physically fit, and very vocal (and physical - when he breaks windows constantly!) about his displeasure of having her as his nurse.  Nevertheless, she is determined to help him in any way she can, even though she thinks she is an abject failure when it comes to nursing, since so many of her patients died. <br /> <br />Lord Rand didn't want a nurse - and he most certainly didn't want Sylvan as his nurse!  She had entranced him when he had last seen her, but now his bitterness doesn't allow him to see her as a respectable person, and he is determined to hurt her and chase her away.  Sylvan seems to be hardier than he expected, though, and before long he finds himself madly in love with her.  But there is something wrong with Clairmont Court - a man is stalking women and attacking them at night - and Rand must discover who this man is before he can settle into happiness with Sylvan. <br /> <br />This book didn't really do much for me.  I thought I'd like it because of the summary on the back, but I never clicked with Rand or Sylvan.  Rand was a jerk and never really apologized for saying some really hideous things to and about Sylvan, and he just expected her to forgive him because of his injuries or because he thought to protect her from something else.  And Sylvan was too weak for my tastes.  She might have been strong, once upon a time, but being exposed to the horrors of war, losing her reputation and incurring society's wrath, and being placed near the acidic Rand didn't do anything for her personality except harm it even further.  Furthermore, I felt like I was being told about the romance, rather than experiencing it throughthe eyes of one of the characters.  The author's writing style and I never meshed well. <br /> <br />The whole \\"ghost story whodunit\\" plot was absurd and disappointing.  Not only had I figured it out within a few chapters, but the whole melodramatic scene at the end was just silly.  And as for who Gail's father was - geesh, as soon as she was mentioned I figured that out, how ignorant could Sylvan be?  There was a lot of promise in this book, but it just didn't work for me.	2004-11-08

Miss Amy Bainbridge had seen what gambling could do to a man and his family as she watched her father lose his money repeatedly, eventually taking his own life in desperation.  Amy is determined to not follow his path, and abhors gambling and those who gamble.  So when she meets the dashing Earl of Tallant, she is determined not to fan the flames of attraction because he is a gambler just like her father.  Once Amy gets a fortune quite by accident, she finds herself being pursued by several eligible men.  So why is that her mind keeps drifting to the Earl of Tallant? <br /> <br />Joss, Earl of Tallant, had not had an easy life.  He had watched his parents' marriage fail dismally, and he was determined to not fall in love or to marry.  When he first sees Amy, he doesn't think she'll be any temptation to him at all - not only does she not inspire his amorous attentions, but she abhors him and his lifestyle.  As he gets to know Amy better, however, he finds that his carefully constructed facade of polite detachment may just crumble after all! <br /> <br />I really thought that I would like this book, and there were some good parts to it.  The reason I am giving it only one star, however, is because I was left wondering where the romance was!  The love story was crammed into the last 75 pages of the book, and it wasn't that good at any rate.  Joss was still sleeping with his mistress with 100 pages left in the book, and he didn't dismiss his mistress until there was only 50 pages left to the book!  That is just not what I find attractive in a romance novel at all.  The hero should NOT be keeping a mistress for 5/6 of the book.  Ick. <br /> <br />I realize that it may be realistic to have Joss so portrayed, but honestly, I do not read romance novels for realism.  If I wanted history, I would read a history book; and if I want to look at a man who is supposedly in love with one person but is sleeping with another, I can just look around my town and surely find many!  I read a romance novel to ESCAPE from reality, and this offered no escape at all.  If Joss and Amy were real characters, I would be warning Amy that Joss would most likely be putting up another mistress in less than a year, so be prepared to have her heart broken!  It's a good thing that I have read other Nicola Cornick books before this, or I surely would have never read one of her books again.	2004-11-07

I'll review each story separately. <br /> <br />\\"Comfort and Joy\\" by Margaret Moore - 5 stars <br /> <br />Griffin Branwynne, Earl of Cwm Rhyss, had been disfigured in a tragic fire years ago.  After his fickle fiancee and his \\"friends\\" deserted him, he retreated to his home, where he had been rarely seen since.  Despite his fearsome reputation, Gwendolyn Davies is determined to see him a few days before Christmas, to beg for money for the orphan's home she runs.  But a snowstorm strands her in Griffin's home, and she soon learns that despite Griffin's gruff exterior, he is a remarkable man.  Gwen has no illusions - she knows she is the orphaned daughter of paupers and that Griffin is an earl - but she can't help but feel a growing admiration for this man. <br /> <br />I really liked this story, it was in my opinion the best in the book.  The author, in less than 100 pages, manages to weave a wonderfully tender romance with interesting characters.  I loved Gwen - unlike many romance heroines, she is utterly realistic when it comes to society's reaction if she was involved with an earl.  It was a great story about two wounded people learning how to trust one another. <br /> <br />\\"Love at First Step\\" by Terri Brisbin - 4 stars <br /> <br />Lord Gavin MacLeod was visiting his foster brother, Orrick, in England for the holidays, which were a bit gloomy since Gavin had lost his wife three years ago.  While there, Orrick asks Gavin to try to discover why the village prostitute, Elizabeth, is a prostitute.  Elizabeth's well-bred manners show that she was gently reared, and Gavin is intrigued with the task.  He soon realizes that he could lose her heart to her - but could he and Elizabeth manage to look over the past and start afresh? <br /> <br />I liked this story once I got into it.  The heroine and hero were both atypical - the hero was in his early 40s, and the heroine was a prostitute.  I had absolutely no qualms about having the heroine being a prostitute.  Why shouldn't she have a happy ending in romanceland, too?  The only part I didn't like was when Gavin and Elizabeth were first together...but Gavin eventually redeemed himself a few times over in my eyes.  A good, but unusual, story.  And for those who are interested - in January 2005, the story of Lord Orrick and Margaret is being released by Harlequin - \\"The King's Mistress\\" by the same author. <br /> <br />\\"A Christmas Secret\\" by Gail Ranstrom - 4 stars <br /> <br />Miss Charity Wardlow is expecting a proposal from her sweetheart this Christmas.  But she has no idea that while she is helping her best friend prepare for her Christmas wedding, her sweetheart is playing her false.  When she overhears a conversation that seems to indicate that her best friend's future husband has an illegitimate child that he refuses to tell her about, Charity is convinced that she must tell her friend at once.  Only Sir Andrew MacGregor, a friend of the groom, convinces her to investigate further before she tells her friend.  As Charity investigates, she learns that everyone has a secret of some sort - and maybe her secret is that she is falling in love with Sir Andrew! <br /> <br />I liked this story.  Charity is a member of the Wednesday League, which has appeared in previous books by Ms. Ranstrom.  The story was well-written and interesting.  Although Charity is a bit naive and immature in the beginning of the story, she grows nicely throughout the story.  I'm looking forward to reading more from all three of these authors.	2004-11-02

His first wife, the beautiful but faithless Melissa, had cheated on him when he needed her the most, and had been killed while running away with one of her lovers.  Believing all women to be somewhat like Melissa, Peter was content to be a widower until his young cousin and heir died unexpectedly.  Since Peter does not want his title and lands to pass to his new heir, his despicable cousin Jack Frobisher, Peter knows he must remarry and produce his own heir!  He proposes to Miss Phoebe Ffolliot, but unknowingly marries her twin sister, Penelope. <br /> <br />Penelope Ffolliot had met Peter twice, and thought he was likeable enough, but she had no plans to marry since she was blind and hated meeting new people and receiving their pity.  But when her odious half-brother loses 30,000 pounds in a gambling debt to Peter, Peter offers to forgive the debt if Miss Ffolliot will marry him.  Penny's brother tries to force Phoebe to marry Peter, but she is newly engaged to the man she loves and Penelope bravely takes her sister's place at the altar to save her sister from a loveless marriage.  Peter is angry at the switch, but as he gets to know Penelope better he finds himself in danger of losing his heart to her, something he swears not to do. <br /> <br />The author's style of writing, although it took me a while to get used to, was engaging once I had gotten through the first couple of chapters, and I had a hard time putting this book down.  I couldn't quite decide if I liked Peter or not for most of the book - on the one hand, he could be quite charming and compassionate towards Penny, but on the other hand, he could be downright cruel to her, as well.  After learning that she is blind, for example, he cruelly tells her that he has apparently married into a family of cheats for he has no wish for his heir to be blind as well (although her blindness is due from an accident, not heredity).  He also tellsher later in the book that it is not her business who his mistresses were or are!  And then he wondered why Penny was so distant from him, perhaps because she could never tell if he was going to be kind to her or treat her like she was a leper. <br /> <br />Still, I couldn't quite give up on Peter, since he reminded me of a wounded animal of sorts, and wounded animals can strike out at those who would even show them kindness.  He had been deeply hurt by his first wife, so I could understand why he would want to keep Penny at arm's length, but he didn't seem to realize that by protecting his own feelings he was hurting her.  Penny was a great heroine, independent despite her blindness, and strong despite the obstacles thrown her way.   <br /> <br />The subplot of trying to decide who was attempting to kill Penny was extremely predictable and could have easily been excluded from the story.  It is obvious who is at fault and why they are trying to harm the Countess of Darleston.  Still, I found the book to be a good one, and wouldn't be surprised to read about George Carstares (Peter's best friend) and Sarah Ffolliot (Penny's younger sister)'s romance once Sarah is of age.  I would read more from this author.	2004-10-29

But in the coming months, he wonders if he shouldn't have listened to her, for not only is Clarissa having difficulty adjusting to Shawnee life, but Wolf Heart finds himself falling in love with her - which would only be a disaster for all involved! <br /> <br />Clarissa Rogers may have been tentatively accepted into the Shawnee tribe after surviving the gauntlet, but she doesn't plan on staying there forever!  As soon as she gets the chance, she is going to run away back to white civilization, no matter how difficult it is!  But as the months pass, and she gets to know Wolf Heart and the Shawnee people more, she feels her heart becoming bound to the village.  When her chance for escape comes, will she choose to return to Fort Pitt - or will she choose to stay with the man who has stolen her heart and his adopted people? <br /> <br />This book was excellent.  Out of all the Native American romances I have read, I would say that this is the most realistic of them all.  Not only is the historic detail amazing in the book - from the clothes, to the language, to the customs - but Clarissa and Wolf Heart seem like they could be real people.  Wolf Heart is torn between his allegiance to the Shawnee tribe and his feelings for Clarissa.  Clarissa is a totally believable captive - she doesn't want to stay with the Shawnee forever, she wants to escape, but as she learns more about the culture and befriends some of the people, sheis torn between staying and leaving.  I think at least some captives went through similar feelings, struggling within on whether to stay or try to leave.  Clarissa's internal struggle made her much more believable, as were her misconceptions of the Shawnee, which although untrue, were common.  An excellent book for those who enjoy history and romance, especially Indian romance, and if the ending doesn't make you sigh, I'll be surprised!  :)	2004-10-28

Rachel Sinclair was an 18-year-old girl trying to care for her two younger brothers after their parents died along the trail west and the trio was left in Green Rapids.  At first squatting in an abandoned shack, Rachel is desperately trying to provide food and shelter, but she knows it will be only a matter of time before they run out of money.  Then Cord McPherson, the owner of the land she is living on, shows up one day and offers her a job as the cook and laundress for the ranch he runs.  Rachel thinks he's an answer to her prayers. <br /> <br />Cord McPherson is attracted to the feisty girl who is so determined to provide for her little family.  She's beautiful, she has a mind of her own, she's loving, and she can cook and clean well, to boot.  So when the preacher's wife demands that Cord marry Rachel to protect her from the gossip circulating around town, it's definitely no hardship for Cord to walk down the aisle!  Cord has no idea what love truly is, but perhaps in time he will find out what it means with Rachel :) <br /> <br />I really loved this book.  Rachel was my kind of heroine - independent, smart, and strong.  She wasn't clingy or the type who couldn't live without a man in her life.  Cord was a pretty good hero, although he was a little too cocky and possessive of Rachel for my tastes.  The two main characters interacted well with one another most of the time, and they didn't fall in love as soon as they met one another - also something I liked.  The author gave them time to develop their relationship and love for one another. <br /> <br />The cast of secondary characters was excellent.  There was another romance in the book - that of Jake (who was a skilled pianist before he joined the Union army and lost his legs in the war) and Lorena (who had been Jake's fiancee before the war, but now Jake avoided her).  Jake could be a beast, but Lorena stood right up to him, so she wasn't spineless either.  Also, fellow rancher Beau Jackson was briefly introduced in this book, and he has his own book (Maggie's Beau by the same author).   <br /> <br />Altogether, a wonderfully tender romantic read that I would definitely recommend.	2004-10-20

Lord Robert Selborne, if he intended to inherit his beloved home Delavel, had to marry one of the women present at his cousin's wedding according to his father's will.  The number of candidates were slim - exactly two, to be precise - until Rob meets the charming chimney sweep's daughter after the wedding.  Since the sweep's daughter, Jemima, interested him, he chose to ask her to marry him.  Of course, he would let her know that it would be a marriage in name only, but wouldn't exactly tell her why - his grandmother's will had stated that if he wanted to inherit the 40,000 pounds she left him, he would have to be celibate for 100 days.  But when circumstances happen that keep bringing Rob and Jemima together, can Rob manage to keep his hands off Jemima that long?<br /><br />Jemima Jewell had grown up on the rough streets and knew better than to believe in anything like love.  Love was a tale for children, and it only brought hurt in the end.  But when her abusive father was about ready to force Jemima into an unhappy marriage, Jemima took the lifeline Rob had thrown to her and decided to marry him, instead.  Rob assured her that their sham marriage would be annulled, and that he would buy her a house in London while he lived in the country.  It seemed like the perfect arrangement to Jemima, until circumstances forced her to join Rob in the country.  Could she keep her heart from falling in love with this man?<br /><br />This book was pretty good.  I liked both Rob and Jemima.  Rob seemed like a pretty easy-going guy, and although he tried to fight it, he couldn't deny his growing attraction for his wife.  Jemima was intelligent and fairly independent, and had no desire to fall in love with anyone.  I could identify with that.  Rob and Jem seemed like real people, unlike a lot of romance book characters.  The secondary romance of Jemima's brother Jack and Rob's cousin Letty was an interesting one, too.  I would read their story if they had their own book :)<br /><br/>The story was unrealistic, especially towards the end when the truth came out about Jemima's humble beginnings.  I just don't see people accepting a sweep's daughter into society.  Still, a very good book and I enjoyed reading it.	2004-10-20

Beau knows that the girl, Maggie, must have been abused for a long time by the way she refuses to trust anyone male.  Nevertheless, Beau is determined to win her trust.  He offers her a place to stay, a job helping out in the kitchen and on the ranch, and even offers to help her learn how to read and write.  And as he watches Maggie blossom from a scared girl into a confident, beautiful woman, Beau knows he wants to offer Maggie one more thing - his hand in marriage. <br /> <br />Maggie O'Neill had only known abuse and hatred at the hands of her father, but she quickly realized that Beau was nothing like the man who sired her.  Beau was patient with her, much more patient than she would have ever expected, and he was determined to protect her at any cost.  As Maggie's heart learns to trust a man for the first time, she finds herself feeling things for Beau that she had never experienced before in her life.  Can she find love after so much heartache in her young life? <br /> <br />This book really just grabbed me from the first page, and I didn't want to put it down until I had finished it!  Beau was a wonderful hero, everything that you would want in a man :)  He was patient and tender, and knew that Maggie needed him to take his courting slow so he wouldn't scare her.  Maggie's transformation was a joy to watch.  She was a frightened girl and slowly became a strong, proud woman.  I loved watching her come into her own.  Maggie and Beau's love story was incredibly tender and romantic.  <br /> <br />The cast of secondary characters was also good.  Cord and Rachel McPherson make an appearance in this book, as well as Jake and Lorena very briefly (both couples were in \\"The Wedding Promise\\" by the same author).  Shay Devereaux was also introduced, I can't wait to read his story (\\"The Seduction of Shay Devereaux\\")!  The last half of the book seems a bit rushed when compared to the first half of the book, but that can be looked over since the romance is SO good between Beau and Maggie :)  This is a wonderful romance, I enjoyed reading it immensely!	2004-10-20

He knew that if he associated with his beautiful neighbor, Molly Thompson, that he could do her reputation damage, but he couldn't keep away from her.  Molly was also drawn to Jesse, although she is the widow of a brutal man, and she believes that no man will ever be attracted to her again because of an accident that left her face scarred.  A litter of orphaned puppies bring them together, can love keep them together? <br /> <br />This story was fantastic, as has been every Carolyn Davidson story I've ever read.  Jesse was a great hero, full of compassion and trying to do his best by Molly, who he knew had been very hurt by her abusive husband.  And Molly was a brave heroine, full of insecurities but determined to go on living despite whatever was thrown her way.  The story seemed a little too action-packed at times, but I realize that is one of the downsides to shorter fiction.  Altogether, a lovely story about two lost souls finding each other. <br /> <br />\\"Home for Christmas\\" by Carol Finch - 5 stars <br /> <br />Former bounty hunter Seth Gresham was determined to bring his dying best friend's daughter, Olivia Ramsey, to Oklahoma Territory for a visit.  Seth thought that Olivia was a spoiled brat at first, but soon learned that first impressions can be deceiving as he spends more time with her on the trail.  Olivia has been burned before by love, and she's determined not to fall in love again because it hurts too much.  But as she spends time with Seth, she wonders if the \\"love\\" she had felt for her treacherous boyfriend had only been make-believe, and perhaps what she was starting to feel for Seth could really be love.  Once the pair discover that Olivia's father isn't dying, merely trying to get Seth and Olivia together, can they get over the betrayal and stay together? <br /> <br />This story was the best of the three in my opinion.  It was full of humor, passion, and romance.  I really liked Seth, he was trying his best to be an honorable guy.  And I could relate to Olivia's heartache.  Perhaps they fell in love a little too quickly, but once again, that has to happen in a short story romance since the pages are limited.  Seth and Olivia were a great pair. <br /> <br />\\"Hark the Harried Angels\\" by Lynna Banning - 4.5 stars <br /> <br />Adam Garnett had spent the last 15 years of his life imprisoned for a murder he had not committed.  Now free, all he did was pace in his backyard, trying to figure out how to get the will to live once more.  His neighbor, Russian immigrant and widow Irina Likov, caught his interest, but both were rather shy and didn't talk to one another much.  So their neighbors, three French ladies, decided to hatch a plan to get Irina and Adam together.  Will it work? <br /> <br />This story was different from the other two stories.  It was a slower, less emotionally-intense romance.  It was really a sweet little story about two lonely people falling in love around Christmas, but there was no great emotional attachment formed with the reader.  Still, the story was a nice read, and a sweet ending to the book.	2004-10-16

The last eight years of Susannah Chapman's life had been a living nightmare.  In the space of only a few months, she had lost her fiance, been framed for the murder of the man responsible for her fiance's death, and discovered she was pregnant with her fiance's baby, knowing the whole time that she would have to give her baby up for adoption.  No one seemed to believe Susannah that she was innocent...that is, until a day eight years after the trial, when the assistant district attorney came to visit Susannah with the news that the man she had been convicted of killing may still be alive!  Before she knows it, Susannah is free, and doesn't have a clue where to start.  Her life is in shambles, her heart aches for the child she had to give up, and no one seems to want to give her a fresh start.  Until the assistant district attorney, Jared Walker, offers to help her get on her feet. <br /> <br />Jared Walker feels horrible over having been partially responsible for sending an innocent woman to prison for the last eight years.  He had become the assistant DA because he had wanted to make sure justice was done - but it wasn't in this case.  So, to right the wrongs committed against Susannah, Jared is determined to help her anyway he can.  He helps her get a job, find an apartment, and get on with her life.  But as he spends more time with Susannah, he realizes what a wonderful person she is, despite all that has happened to her, and he wonders if he could possibly have a chance with the woman who was falsely imprisoned because of his boss's mistakes. <br /> <br />As soon as I read the synopsis on this book, I knew I had to buy it.  The book sounded so different from the other romance novels I have read - and it was!  It was packed with emotion, and you can feel both characters' frustrations, anger, guilt, hurt, bitterness, and eventually love and forgiveness.  Susannah was an amazing character.  She had went into prison a young woman, younger than me, and hadn't let theplace kill her or destroy her.  And now when she was given the chance to be free once more, even though it was extremely difficult to pick up the shattered pieces of her life, she managed to do so.  As for Jared, his determination to try his best to right the wrongs done to Susannah was touching.  I didn't like him at first - he had played a role in Susannah going to jail, but he wasn't the lead prosecutor - but as he tried to mend fences and hunt down the real killer, he won me over.  What an incredible love story! <br /> <br />I also really liked how this book portrayed prison and the struggle to get your life back on track once you are released.  I thought it was a very realistic portrayal.  My younger cousin was in prison for a few years, and when he got out, his behavior and thoughts were a lot like Susannah's, so I could completely understand where Susannah was coming from.  Although Susannah was innocent, her friend Marissa was most likely not, but the author portrayed Marissa in a positive light, which shows the truth, that not everyone in prison is a murderer or a maniac with an antisocial personality.   <br /> <br />There's no explicit sex scenes in this book, so those who prefer clean reads shouldn't have much of a problem with this book.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who was looking for a very emotionally-charged read.  If your heart isn't moved by this book, I'll be very surprised.	2004-10-14

Elaine Lowry had always wanted a child of her own, but her ex-husband Kevin had never thought the time was right.  Now Elaine finds herself a 37-year-old divorcee with no children of her own, while her ex-husband's new trophy wife is expecting Kevin's child.  So Elaine decides to take matters into her own hands and try artificial insemination as a way to get a child of her own.  And she's content with her plan, until the lawyer that represented her ex-husband in their divorce shows up at her doorstep, challenging her notions about artificial insemination and stirring her long-dormant heart. <br /> <br />Mitch Ryder had always felt guilty about representing Kevin in the divorce, although he had had little choice in the matter.  He has been trying to discretely look after Elaine for the past nine months, and he just bought her apartment before it was sold to someone who would probably charge her a lot more money to live there.  He's definitely tempted by his colleague's ex-wife, but he doesn't believe in love or happily-ever-afters.  But when she tells him of her plan to have a child, Mitch wonders if maybe he wouldn't be the perfect father for her children! <br /> <br />This book was really good!  I was laughing aloud several times, especially during the \\"Pick a Daddy\\" party.  Elaine was a really likeable character, and I think a lot of women can identify with some part of her struggles.  As for Mitch, he was sinfully delicious.  Who wouldn't want a Mitch showing up on their doorstep?  :)  The cover art on the book is beautiful!  I usually don't buy a book because of the cover, but the cover art was really what drew my attention at first.  The cast of secondary characters was excellent, from Mitch's workaholic meat-loving sister, to Mitch's sugary sweet but surprisingly attuned step-mother (and Elaine's neighbor).  This book really just about had it all.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet, funny, and tender romance with realistic characters.	2004-10-12

Enrico DiRinaldi was left paralyzed after he saved a woman from being mugged.  Despite his paralysis, which may be either temporary or permanent, he wants to have a family of his own.  So, after playing his friend Gianna Lakewood and his fiancee Chiara off of one another, he dumps the heartless Chiara and proposes marriage to Gianna.  Despite his marriage proposal, there is no love involved in this match on his part.  But is that good enough for Gianna?<br /><br />Gianna Lakewood has loved Rico since she was a young girl, and she rushed to his beside when he was in the hospital, unlike his fiancee.  She'd love to marry him and have his children, but he had never looked at her that way.  To him, she was only the daughter of his mother's best friend, a sisterly sort of girl, not a desirable woman.  So when Rico proposes marriage to her, she's shocked to say the least, but she says yes because it's like a dream come true - except Rico doesn't love her.  Can she be satisfied with a loveless marriage, or can she change Rico's heart?<br /><br />Well, I thought this book was going to be better than it actually was.  I didn't like Rico or Gianna.  Rico was a complete jerk and treated Gianna like she wasn't worth hardly anything to him.  Not only did he order her around constantly, ask her embarrassing questions in front of other people, act like a Neanderthal when it came to her sharing a hotel suite with his brother because she couldn't afford a hotel room of her own, but he was just plain rude.  He would say and do the most hurtful things to Gianna, and then just excuse it because he was in a temper.  I'm sorry, that is NOT a good excuse.  And when he flirted with the flight attendant on the flight back to Italy, mere hours after marrying Gianna, because he didn't think Gianna was paying enough attention to him - it just showed what an immature jerk he was, and sad to say, he didn't do much growing up in the book at all.<br /><br />Gianna was a doormat.  She let Rico walk all over her in the name of her love for him.  She let him say hateful things to her.  She let him use her to make his fiancee jealous.  She didn't stand up to either Rico or Chiara when they were accusing her of trying to break them up while Rico was in the hospital.  She NEVER stood up to Chiara and just let the other woman use her as a punching bag.  Gianna spent much of the book whining because Rico didn't love her, but saying that she'd rather live with him in a loveless marriage than be out of his life for good.  Please.  She needed to grow a backbone.  Unfortunately, she never did, either.  So, basically, if you like a spineless heroine and a caveman hero, this is the book for you.  If you like a heroine with just an ounce of courage, read something else.o walk all over her in the name of her love for him.  She let him say hateful things to her.

While Hallie viewed the twins akin to younger siblings, Paul has other ideas and buys her a very expensive ring and proposes to her.  Hallie isn't going to accept his proposal, for not only is Paul several years younger than her, but she is returning to California in two weeks to take her vows and become a nun in every sense of the word.  Paul's father walks in on Paul proposing, accusing Hallie of all sorts of deception and trickery.  But when Paul tries to kill himself shortly after, Paul's father has no choice but to invite Hallie to his home in an effort to keep Paul's mental state stable. <br /> <br />Vincent Rolland is attracted to Hallie, but he knows that nothing can come of it.  Not only has he been brutally betrayed in the past by a former love, but Hallie is about to become a nun and his son fancies himself in love with Hallie.  Despite all of the obstacles set before them, however, Vincent craves Hallie's company.  Will Hallie truly become a nun, or will she become Vincent's bride instead? <br /> <br />This book never really captured my attention, unfortunately.  There were so many unrealistic coincidences, and the characters were so predictable and dull.  A lot of the book didn't make sense - a teenage boy has a crush on an older woman, so the solution is to bring her home and show that she isn't perfect?  The strong, loving relationship between father and children is potentially irrevocably broken because he calls them to task on one thing?  The similarities between Vincent's doomed love affair and Paul's are so similar, without Paul knowing a thing about his mother, that they are practically the same?  I just didn't get into this book at all.  The characters were flat and the plot didn't make too much sense.  I won't be reading this again.	2004-10-07

Her witty writing style, tempered with tried and true advice, is a hit with men and women alike.  But her new assignment is making her have serious doubts.  Her editor wants her to see if military men live up to their expectations of being great lovers.  Cyn bets her editor that military men are just playboys with a girl in every port.  Heaven knows, her emotionally cold, bigamist, career Navy father was like that.  So Cyn goes undercover at a military bar, covertly writing down her observations and determined to prove herself right.  But once Cyn meets Ethan, she begins to question if all military men are \\"love 'em then leave 'em\\" kind of guys...because she's tempted to have Ethan for keeps! <br /> <br />Major Ethan McCormick is the ideal Marine, and the ideal candidate for a promotion.  But all of the other candidates have significant others, and he thinks it will be a detriment to his chances if he doesn't show up with at least a fiancee.  The problem is, he's been so hurt in the past by a betrayal, he's devoted his entire life to his career and hasn't dated in over a year.  Once he spots Cyn in a bar, however, he knows that she's the ideal candidate for his \\"fake fiancee\\" for the next two weeks, until he snags that promotion.  Ethan discovers that his feelings for his \\"fake fiancee\\" are becoming all too real!  But once he discovers that his J.C. is really Dr. Cyn, the woman who has been trashing the reliability and sexual prowess of military men in her column, will he walk away from her for good? <br /> <br />This book was a joy to read, I had a very hard time putting it down!  I laughed out loud on several occasions, the book was hilarious as well as wickedly sensual.  The sparks flew - literally.  I never knew reading about learning how to dance or making dinner could be so hot ;)  Ethan was just yummy - a Marine in every sense of the word, tall, handsome, strong, dedicated to country and family, and trust-worthy.  As for J.C., I really identified with her.  Having a bad father figure really works on you when it comes to adult relationships.  She was a fun character - witty, smart, independent, yet painfully lacking in trust at times.  Since Ethan had his own heartache in his past to work through, it was interesting to watch them work together on making their \\"fake\\" relationship a real one. <br /> <br />Did I mention how hot this book is?  Be prepared to take a cold shower once you get done reading this one!  ;)  This book is definitely a winning combination of romance, humor, trust issues, sensuality, and a bit of a mystery (someone's stalking J.C. - who is it?).  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a passionate read.	2004-10-05

Lincoln Slade, the town's former bad boy, comes along and not only manages to save Jerald Randolph's life, but also claims responsibility for Tracy Lynn's child!  Jerald demands that Tracy Lynn and Linc marry, so they agree to a marriage of convenience.  But once the marriage ends, can Tracy Lynn let go of this man? <br /> <br />Linc Slade had had a crush on Tracy Lynn for ages, but he always knew they could never end up together.  Tracy Lynn was a society girl, a woman more comfortable at fancy parties than living on a ranch.  Linc, on the other hand, was a loner, the younger son of an abusive drunken father, and preferred the company of animals over the company of people.  But as he gets to know Tracy Lynn better, he's wondering if maybe she couldn't fit in with ranch life, after all.  She brought joy to his bitter heart, but could he let go of his past to embrace a future with Tracy Lynn? <br /> <br />The book started out a bit slow, but definitely earned five stars in my opinion by the end!  Linc was a wonderful hero - brooding, emotionally scarred from his childhood, and noble.  He could rescue Tracy Lynn from being an embarrassment to her father, but he didn't know just yet that he needed her to help rescue him from his past!  The cast of secondary characters was also quite good.  The ending just left me breathless.  You could honestly feel the emotions of both Linc and Tracy Lynn throughout the book.  I'll definitely be looking forward to reading the rest of the Texas Sweethearts series!	2004-10-04

Her greatest fears are that he will offer her a marriage of convenience for the baby's sake - or he will send her a support check every month, but will write her and the child out of his life for good.  So Natalie decides to keep her little secret, and that's not the only secret she's keeping! <br /> <br />Doctor Patrick Barr is very attracted to his secretary, even though she shows no inclination to repeat the passionate night they shared together on his yacht.  She seems withdrawn since their experience, not like the bubbly person she had once been.  Once he accidentally discovers she's pregnant, his immediate thought is that the baby is his, although she denies it.  So, thinking that she is carrying another man's child, will he find that he loves her enough to accept her and the child that isn't his...or will he let them walk out of his life? <br /> <br />I didn't like the character of Natalie at all.  She didn't even have the decency to tell Patrick that she was pregnant, and when he did find out, she deliberately let him think that the child was her ex-husband's, not his!  And then she wondered why Patrick wasn't asking her to marry him!  Well, let's think this one out.  Patrick thinks that, not only is Natalie pregnant with another man's baby, but she was sleeping with two different guys during the same time period and doesn't bother to tell either about the other.   <br /> <br />The worst part about the whole book was, Natalie was just going to pretend the baby wasn't Patrick's and never give him the opportunity to know that he had a child, never give him the opportunity to spend time with the child, and never give him the opportunity to help raise his child.  That's just sick.  If a man is the father of your baby, and he is a good man and would love to be an active part of the child's life, how can you deny him and your child that?  My daughter would LOVE to have a father who cared anything for her!  So I felt absolutely no sympathy for Natalie.   <br /> <br />This book was a real chore to read.  I ended up gritting my teeth and wanting to throttle the heroine.  I won't be reading any of the other books in \\"The Babies of Doctors Circle\\" series, and most definitely won't be reading this book again, either.  If you're looking for a good book to read - skip this one.	2004-10-03

Cecily Peterson had always loved Tate Winthrop, ever since he had rescued her from her step-father.  And though she loves him still, she has gradually come to accept that there will never be a future between them.  Tate is obsessed with keeping his bloodlines pure, and refuses to have a \\"half breed\\" child.  If he marries, it will be a 100% Lakota woman.  So Cecily buries her love in her studies, majoring in archaeology.  But once she learns that Tate had lied to her and had been paying for her living expenses and tuition all along, she quits graduate school, moves into another apartment, and gets a job in a new museum dedicated to Native American culture.   <br /> <br />Tate Winthrop ended up with a lap full of crab bisque once Cecily learned that he, and not a scholarship, had been funding her schooling.  Still, despite his anger, he was still attracted to Cecily, but he wouldn't cross that line - until a moment came along that swept them both away.  But Tate is in the middle of a shocking political scandal, though he doesn't yet know it, and once he learns the truth, he may turn his back on his family, and Cecily, forever. <br /> <br />This book was okay.  I bought the reissue from HQN books, a new line from Harlequin.  Tate left me cold as a hero.  Not only was Cecily's friend, Colby Lane, much more interesting and exciting to me, but Tate was a racist - or at least was hiding behind racism to justify not getting involved with Cecily.  That just made my blood run cold.  I'm 3/4 Hispanic and originally from Mexico.  My race is a mixed race, a mixture of native peoples, white (Spaniards especially), and black.  Since there were very few slaves in Mexico, we are primarily a mixture of white and native.  So the whole time Tate was waxing on about how he didn't want a mixed baby, I felt like he was putting me down, and my entire people down.  So Tate did absolutely nothing for me except to infuriate me. <br /> <br />As for the character of Cecily, I don't know what she saw in the guy.  Sure, he helped her escape from her step-father, so of course she should be grateful for that, but he kept pushing her away, being mean to her, and deliberately flaunting his relationships with other women in her face.  The funny thing is, all of his other women were white and blonde but he wouldn't date Cecily because she was white and blonde.  Yeah, that makes sense.  I was really hoping Cecily would hook up with Colby, but oh well.  Hopefully Ms. Palmer will give him his own book, he was worth 10 of Tate! <br /> <br />Tate did attempt to redeem himself in the end, but it was too little too late.  I'm not going to give up on Diana Palmer as an author, but I surely hope she doesn't write more about more racist heroes.  I'll definitely look forward to a book about Colby, however, if one is written about him (and I hope so!).	2004-10-03

Maggie Barton rushed home from Morocco after she discovered that her foster brother, Cord Romero, had been injured in a bomb explosion.  Three days later, after enduring numerous airport delays and lack of sleep, she arrives to find that Cord doesn't want to see her or have anything to do with her.  Dejected because she had turned down her job to rush to Cord's side, she needs to find a temporary job until she can leave Texas - and Cord - far behind her.  But Cord's in the middle of a dangerous job, and her new job puts her in harm's way, too.  Cord is going to have to protect her...    Cord Romero didn't really know what to do with Maggie.  He found her incredibly attractive, even though she wanted little to do with men because of a childhood trauma he knew nothing about.  He's on the trail of a dangerous child pornography ring, but before he knows it Maggie has involved herself and he's going to need to keep her very close to keep an eye on her.  He doesn't count on falling in love with her - and wanting to keep her by his side, forever.    Okay, this is only the third Diana Palmer book I have read, but already they are starting to run together and sound awfully similar.  The plot seems to be: white younger woman who isn't drop-dead gorgeous is completely inexperienced when it comes to sex and men; dark, handsome, and dangerous man with issues falls in love with heroine after treating her cruelly.  This book was the same.  Cord treated Maggie like a jerk, but she still loved him despite his cruelty towards her.  Maggie was totally naive about just about everything, especially men.  She had the emotional maturity of about a 10 year old girl.  I didn't really care for either the hero or the heroine.  Reading this book once was enough - I won't be picking it up again.	2004-10-03

Gretchen Brannon was a small-town Texan who had lived a very sheltered, protected life.  She had never done anything adventurous in her life - until she took a vacation to Morocco with her best friend Maggie, who is going to be the personal assistant of the ruling sheikh of Qawi.  Maggie is called away unexpectedly, and insists that Gretchen take her place as the sheikh's personal assistant.  Gretchen agrees, but before she goes to Qawi she intends to enjoy her vacation in Morocco.  While at the hotel, she meets a charming man who goes by the name of Philippe.  She finds herself falling for him, but little does she know that Philippe is her new boss! <br /> <br />Philippe knew right away that Gretchen wasn't Maggie, but he found himself completely charmed by Gretchen.  He hired Maggie to play the part of his lover because he must appear powerful and virile even though he hasn't been a \\"true man\\" since a landmine accident nine years ago.  As his feelings for Gretchen mature, even though he knows he can never have a \\"true\\" marriage or children, he finds himself offering her marriage so her reputation won't be sullied.  His enemy, however, is shadowing Sheikh Philippe and he knows Gretchen won't be safe as long as she is by his side. <br /> <br />This book was really good, so good that I couldn't bear to put it down!  Every time I was going to put the book away and do something else (like study for one of my college exams!), I promised myself that I would read \\"only one more chapter,\\" and before I knew it I had finished the book.  I was absolutely fascinated by the characters and the setting!  Philippe, although he could be high-handed at times, was an incredible hero who made my mouth water :)  After finishing the book, I really wanted to start all over from the beginning! <br /> <br />The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five was Philippe's treatment of Gretchen once Brianne, his former flame, came into the picture.  Quite frankly, he was a jerk, but he more than made up for it in the end :)  The book was a captivating piece of escapist literature.  If you want to relax for a few hours and escape from reality, this is an excellent way to do it.	2004-09-28

Marc Wilde had once had everything he desired - an exciting job as a foreign war correspondent, athletic prowess as a snowboarder and skier, and dozens of beautiful women who wanted to get to know him better.  Now, after a bomb blast in the Middle East, Marc was confined in a wheelchair, not knowing if he would ever be able to walk again.  He spent most of his days getting drunk in a nearby town, bitter against the world.  That's how he met Fiona Gordon - a pretty substitute teacher who worked part-time as a barmaid to help pay the bills.   <br /> <br />Fiona didn't like men who drank a lot, and she surely didn't like men with attitude problems.  Yet, there was something different about Marc Wilde, something that told Fiona that he needed help to deal with all of the physical and emotional pain he had.  Fiona had her own problems - a teenage brother who was also a paraplegic, too many bills, and not enough money - but she is still drawn to Marc in an effort to help him.  She is determined to not get too close to him, though.  Marc tells her that he will fully recover in time, and Fiona knows that once he is able to walk, he'll be out of her life and never look back.  Still, how can she protect her heart from him? <br /> <br />Well, this book really lived up to the \\"emotional\\" part of the Harlequin Superromance tagline!  The ups and downs of Fiona and Marc's friendship/romance could really tug at the heartstrings.  I even cried during one part of the book, and I rarely cry when I read.  The romance seemed realistic.  It wasn't a music in the air, roses every date kind of romance.  Instead, it was down-to-earth, with Fiona and Marc needing to deal with their own insecurities and fears as the relationship progressed.  Fiona was a bit too sugary-sweet sometimes, and Marc was a bit too crass at times, but altogether this book was very well put together and offered a heart-warming romance.	2004-09-26

Plus-sized model Jodie Marsh had spent an incredible weekend with Texan architect Travis Whitaker.  The weekend led to Jodie getting pregnant, however, which frightens her.  Her career is just starting to take off, and she had just signed a contract with a cosmetics company.  The company had made her sign a morality clause, and Jodie knows the company will fire her if she's an unwed mother.  So Jodie shows up on Travis' doorstep, trying to convince him to marry her for convenience's sake.   <br /> <br />Travis Whitaker is a confirmed bachelor and doesn't plan on marrying again.  He's already failed at one marriage, and he is sure that he doesn't want to go through that again.  But when Jodie shows up in Texas begging him to marry her, he actually considers marriage once more.  He doesn't want a love match, but he does want a real marriage, with Jodie living with him in Texas.  Jodie's main focus seems to be on her career, however, and Travis is concerned that she's not focusing enough on the baby.  Can Travis and Jodie find love and happiness with one another? <br /> <br />This book was pretty good.  Travis was a good guy, even though he was too domineering in some parts of the book.  He admitted that he usually dated wasp-thin women who pretty much didn't have backbones of their own, so he didn't know how to react to Jodie some of the time.  And Jodie, well, I liked her fairly well, but she could be a jerk at times, too.  She had been alone for so long that she pretty much shrugged off any help anyone else could provide.  It was interesting to watch them reconcile their differences. <br /> <br />Like a previous reviewer, I also believe that some of the size references were forced.  Jodie seemed to be confident in herself most of the time, but then she'd make some off-the-wall comment, like when Travis said he was going to pick her up and carry her, she said something like \\"you and what army?\\"  I don't like it when people put themselves down like that.  Still, she was more confident in her size and beauty than some women I know who are her size.  Altogether, a good book, but probably not one I'll read again.	2004-09-26

Advertising executive Richard Wells thinks he has created the perfect reality TV show, one that will ensure the creation of his own agency.  His idea: take a soap opera hottie and have 15 gorgeous women duke it out to become his wife.  But when a \\"cosmetic enhancement\\" complication keeps one of the contestants from being on the show, Richard is in a panic.  Everything is set up for 15 contestants, not 14!  He manages to convince his assistant, Bridget Connor, to fill in for the missing beauty, never guessing that she would make it past the first cut.  But she does...and Richard finds himself insanely jealous, although he doesn't know why! <br /> <br />Bridget Connor has had a crush of Richard for a while, but she hasn't admitted that to anyone, not even to herself.  So when he convinces her to go on his reality show, she only does it to show herself - and maybe to show Richard - that other men can and do find her attractive.  When she makes the first cut, she's ecstatic, but it puts a strain on her friendship with Richard.  As Bridget is continually picked for the next rounds and creeps closer to becoming a heartthrob's wife, can she find the courage to tell Richard her feelings? <br /> <br />This book had some truly funny moments in it, and some very interesting secondary characters.  Fluff-head Raquel, who means well but usually says the wrong thing at the wrong time, and Raquel's \\"ex\\"-boyfriend Lars with the fake Swedish/French accent were both amusing characters.  The dynamics behind the reality show were interesting, as none of the characters truly wanted to marry a heartthrob off camera (of course, they said something different on camera).  Most of them were using the show to further their own acting careers.  The book pokes a lot of fun at the reality tv phenomenon and the people who take the shows very seriously. <br /> <br />The romance between Bridget and Richard didn't really sizzle that much.  Richard, I must admit, was a jerk.  He tried to rationalize everything he felt for Bridget away, and even when it looked like he and Bridget were getting close to one another, Richard had to deliberately ruin it all.  Bridget spent much of the book wondering why Richard didn't love her and/or trying to decipher what he was saying to her.  Eventually the romance got kicked up a few degrees, but this book is more of a funny story than a romance.	2004-09-26

Tyree St. James had been cursed by his best friend, Sullivan Fouquet, after he accidentally killed both Sully and his ladylove Elizabeth.  Tyree was doomed to spend the next 200 years wandering the earth, a soul caught between life and death, until he found a woman who was willing to die for him.  Since Tyree didn't want another death on his hands, he didn't even try to find such a woman.  Now, with only a week left to the curse, Tyree is sure that he will be dying and finally figure out if he's going to heaven or hell.  Unfortunately, he finds Clara Ferguessen in his bed, and he finds that he doesn't want to die after all, but for him to live Clara  must die... <br /> <br />Clara Ferguessen, a distant descendent of Sullivan Fouquet, was in Magnolia Cove to write an article about the pirate legend for an adventure magazine.  She's shocked to see Tyree lounging in her bed, but he convinces her that he's just a figment of her imagination and they spend an incredible night together.  The only problem is, the next morning she wakes up and realizes he's a flesh-and-blood man, even though he's talking crazily about being a 200 year old dead pirate.  Still, despite believing Tyree has serious mental problems, Clara finds herself falling in love with him, but Tyree insists their affair will have to be shortlived.  But as Tyree and Clara work together to find out who is setting fires to historical houses in the area, Clara realizes she doesn't want a short-term affair.  She wants Tyree forever, and she'll do nearly anything to have him. <br /> <br />I'll admit it, I'm not usually a big fan of pirate romances.  This one, however, was excellent and does much credit to the genre.  Tyree was sinfully delicious, and Clara was a pretty good heroine, although she was very resistant towards believing that Tyree might actually be a ghost.  Of course, if someone claimed that they were a ghost, I probably wouldn't believe him either!  The love scenes were hot, and the tension between Clara and Tyree was amazing.  Since the reader really knew that Tyree was a lost soul, the book was heart-wrenching at times as you wonder how this story could ever end happily. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that some of the story just wasn't developed well enough, and the ending didn't wrap up all of the loose ends.  The fire-setting mystery was pretty anticlimactic, and I was wondering if it was thrown in the mix just so it could be classified as an Intimate Moments romance (which seems to be very open to paranormal stories, much more so than other lines of Harlequin).  Still, this book was a great read, and I definitely see myself reading it again in the future.	2004-09-15

His wife Cecilia had recoiled in horror and disgust when she had discovered her husband was missing part of his leg.  She had run away and committed bigamy soon after Garrick returned home from the Civil War.  Garrick never heard from her for years - until she was near death; then she had sent the son he had never known about to live with him.  Garrick is content to raise his son, forget about women in general, and run the new newspaper in a small Texas town.  He is furious to learn that the pressMAN he had hired not only a woman, but a Yankee woman! <br /> <br />Maggie Harper was a good pressman - well, pressperson - and knew she'd do a great job for Garrick's fledgling newspaper, if only he'd give her a chance!  Maggie was fleeing her own disastrous love affair.  She had been engaged to a Yankee captain who had \\"forgotten\\" to mention he was already married!  Her reputation in shambles in Austin, Texas, she applies for a job as a pressman and never discloses her gender one way or the other.  She'll show Garrick a thing or two - and as they work with one another, the more determined she is to show Garrick that not all women were like his faithless wife. <br /> <br />I liked this book fairly well.  This is one of the few Civil-War-era books I have read where the South isn't portrayed as evil, and the real story of what happened during Reconstruction isn't made more palatable.  Since I lived in Texas for a while, I think that is great :)  Garrick was an interesting character, although he was a bit too cruel to Maggie for much of the book.  Maggie was a good heroine.  At first I thought she was making too big of a deal over the fact that she wasn't a virgin, but after seeing reactions once the information was made known, maybe she wasn't overreacting after all!   <br /> <br />Besides Garrick's cruelty to Maggie, the only other complaint I had was the band of thieves that took up much of the book.  Too much of the book was focused on capturing the thieves, and not nearly enough of the book was spent on Garrick's and Maggie's romance.  Secondary plots shouldn't overwhelm the main plot, and that is what happened in this book.  Still, it was an enjoyable book and I may read it again.	2004-09-08

She had the love of her life, Mark Steele, and she was expecting his baby.  Then, when she was traveling to see Mark off at the airport when he was deployed to Iraq, she had been in a car accident and lost her baby, her sight, and Mark.  Claire was now a workaholic, devoted only to her radio psychology show and her work at a research center.  A serial killer, uncreatively named the Midnight Murderer, was calling into Claire's show and taunting her before he killed his victims.  Claire could be his next target - and she might also be able to help the FBI catch the man.  When FBI Agent Mark Steele, her former love, is assigned to be her bodyguard, though, sparks fly. <br /> <br />Mark Steele had been raised in the military, so he had joined as soon as he could.  He had proposed to Claire Kos before he left for Iraq, but she had never showed up at the airport and two weeks later had returned his engagement ring with a brief typewritten note.  Stung at her rejection, Mark devoted his life to his men, but an ambush left Mark the sole survivor.  Burdened with guilt, Mark returned to the United States and joined the FBI.  When he learns that his duty is to guard Dr. Claire Kos, he's both intrigued and hurt.  How could she have broken his heart like that?  When he learns that she's blind, he wants to help her, but she doesn't want him near her.  Once they catch the Midnight Murderer, can Mark and Claire still have a future together if they both survive? <br /> <br />I didn't really like the character of Claire at all.  She seemed to blame Mark for everything for half of the book, and then blamed herself for the other half of the book.  She was angry that Mark hadn't tried to contact her - well, let's see, if someone didn't show up at the airport to show me off (he had no idea that she had been in a car accident, and she refused to tell him) and then sent my engagement ring back with a one-sentence typewritten note while I was off serving my country in the military, I wouldn't contact that person, either.  But, of course, it was all Mark's fault.  And then Claire never gave Mark a chance because she just assumed that because she was blind, he wouldn't want an \\"imperfect woman\\" (I hate to tell her, but she was \\"imperfect\\" before her blindness, no one is perfect!).   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Mark was loaded down with guilt from the ambush that left all of his men dead and himself gravely wounded, so he just tacked on some more guilt when Claire was concerned.  Everything bad that happened to her was his fault, according to Mark.  I liked the character of Mark besides his tendency to internalize every little thing.  It really got tiresome reading about how Claire blamed Mark, Claire blamed Claire, and Mark blamed Mark.  Some things just happen, and it's nobody's fault, it's just the way the dice fall. <br /> <br />The book wasn't a total waste, if you can get over how everyone blames everyone else in the book.  The identity of the killer is interesting to try and figure out, although I did figure it out pretty quickly once the facts started piling up.  It was a pretty decent book, but one that I probably won't re-read.	2004-08-19

Nurse practitioner Nell Dolan, also known as the \\"Angel of Ark Street\\" because of her work at a free clinic there, was hoping that any extra exposure the clinic received from the press would bring in some badly needed donations to keep the clinic running.  Nell, however, didn't want negative exposure - and it looked like the clinic just might receive that, for as soon as a reporter showed up to discuss the clinic, Nell realized that someone was stealing drugs from the clinic and trying to blame her.  If the cynical reporter, Joe Reilly, broke the story, Nell's career, not to mention the clinic, might be in ruins.  She tries to keep Joe at bay, but her heart doesn't seem to want to listen to her.  How can she be falling for a man who could unearth all of her past secrets? <br /> <br />Joe Reilly was a bitter man after he returned to the United States from Iraq.  He had been an embedded reporter until a badly broken ankle had made him give up on his jet-setting ways.  Now the former world correspondent was stuck in Chicago writing for the metro page.  Joe didn't believe in altruistic motives, but his cynical beliefs were challenged by Nell Dolan, who seemed to have no ulterior motive when working at the Ark Street Free Clinic.  Despite his bitter nature and his own secrets, Joe is drawn to Nell.  Can these two bitter, broken hearts find solace in one another? <br /> <br />This book was pretty good, I really liked the author's writing style.  The pace was fast enough to keep things moving, but not fast enough to confuse the reader.  Joe's two brothers, especially Mike the police officer, were interesting characters and I'd like to see them have their own stories someday.  Joe was a bit too gruff and bitter for my tastes at first, but once I learned more about his history and why he had become that way, I began to warm up to his character.  Nell was way too co-dependent and needy.  She liked to be in control, but she had to be needed, too.  The result was an aloof, yetneedy, control freak who had a tendency to act like a jerk.  She was way too much of a doormat in her past life and didn't seem to show much improvement throughout the book.  The ending really didn't do a thing for me, which was a disappointment. <br /> <br />Altogether, this book is good reading and merits four stars easily.  Had Nell been a little more independent and a little less of a jerk, perhaps I would have rated the book higher.  I just really don't like characters who mean one thing yet continually say another, then wonder why the other characters can't read their minds.	2004-08-19

He finds both in Johanna Patterson's farm.  The only problem is, he'll have to marry Johanna because she refuses to sell the farm to anyone.  A marriage of convenience seems to be the solution for all involved - Tate will have a place to raise his boys, Johanna will have the help she so desperately needs, and the boys will have a mother.  Love doesn't figure into the equation, or does it? <br /> <br />Johanna Patterson was used to being alone.  Her mother had died ten years before, and her father had never been one to show her much affection or consideration.  Once he died, Johanna found herself the sole owner of the farm, but unable to keep up with all of the work.  Johanna didn't want to marry Tate, or anyone for that matter, but it really was for the best she decided.  Johanna didn't want to rely on any man again.  She had been hurt by her father and her former lover, and she knew better than to trust a man.  Still, Tate and his two boys find a place in her heart, and she begins to wonder if this marriage of convenience could turn into a love match. <br /> <br />I know that other reviewers gave this book a high rating, but I just couldn't.  I read the first 100 pages or so, and never did I feel a connection with any of the characters.  The book was so dull.  I'm a fanatic about reading a book to the end, but there is no way I'll be able to finish this book because it is just so dull.  I'm really disappointed because I expected a heart-warming emotional read.  Instead, the only tears I could possibly shed after reading this book are tears of boredom.	2004-08-09

He had nearly ruined her reputation by kissing her in full view of the entire town, and the next day he had been gone without a word.  Emily spent the next seven years nursing her broken heart and trying desperately to find a way to support her father (the town vicar) and her young brother.  Emily is about to embark on a journey to London as a governess when she learns that Nicholas, and her young brother, have returned from a voyage at sea.  Emily sneaks into the house only to discover that her brother and two other sailors have blue cholera.  Emily must remain at Nicholas' house until the epidemic has subsided, which is surely to shred her reputation even further! <br /> <br />Nicholas had fancied Emily when she was a young girl, and the ill-fated kiss had proved ruinous for both of them.  Not only was Emily's reputation shattered, but Nicholas had been forced to travel to India the next day by his overbearing father.  Nicholas spent seven years in exile, returning to England only once his cold-hearted, manipulative father died and left Nicholas earl.  Nicholas regretted leaving Emily all those years before, but he had had no choice in the matter.  His chance to redeem himself in her eyes, however, presented itself when Emily unknowingly walked into the middle of a cholera outbreak.  Nicholas offered to marry her to save what was left of her reputation, and Emily agreed.  Can this marriage of convenience turn into a love match? <br /> <br />I am fanatical about reading books until the end, no matter how much I dislike the book.

Emily was more than \\"mischief,\\" she was a real jerk.  All she did was yell at Nicholas and treat him shabbily, and Nicholas, for the most part, acted like he deserved to be treated so badly.  Emily jumped to preposterous conclusions at the drop of a hat and never asked any questions to actually straighten out matters.  She is one of the most immature, self-righteous, shrewish heroines I have ever had the misfortune of reading about.  Nicholas was way too good for her, even though he could be a little ill-tempered at times (who wouldn't be after hanging around Emily for so long???).  Maybe the rest of the book got better, but with such an awful beginning, I don't think there is much that can be done to save the rest of the book.	2004-08-09
US	23595366	R1X1OTDX4R04EA	0373291795	173359685	A Western Family Christmas	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Christmas western style	This book contained three stories, which I'll talk about and rate individually.  Altogether, the book earned a solid four stars, thanks to the wonderful \\"Cowboy Scrooge\\" story by Liz Ireland. <br /> <br />\\"Christmas Eve\\" by Millie Criswell -- 3.5 stars <br /> <br />Eve Barlow hated the Christmas holidays.  Although she had been born on Christmas Eve, it seemed that bad things had to happen around that time.  First, she lost her parents in a horrible train accident the day before Christmas ten years ago, and six years ago she had been left standing at the altar by her no-good-fiance on Christmas Eve.  So Eve was content to keep to herself and not celebrate the Christmas holidays - until drifter Gabe Tyler showed up at her door, asking to rent one of her rooms while he was in town.  Gabe too had faced his share of sorrow in life, and he drifted from town to town searching for his son, who had been disappeared with Gabe's faithless wife several years ago.  An unlikely friendship forms between Gabe and Eve, a friendship that blossoms into romance as an unexpected Christmas gift finds its way on Eve's porch. <br /> <br />This story was moderately good.  Eve was a bit silly when it came to the \\"Christmas curse,\\" and I don't know why she saw her fiance leaving her at the altar as such a bad thing.  I'm sure being left at the altar isn't much fun, but it's got to be better than marrying a real jerk and being stuck with him forever.  This story seemed like it had too much crammed into it.  I know it's a short story, so space is limited, but the author tried to shove way too much stuff into the story.  Take out a few subplots, and maybe the story wouldn't seem so rushed.  The ending, however, will leave a fuzzy feeling in your heart. <br /> <br />\\"Season of Bounty\\" by Mary McBride -- 3.5 stars <br /> <br />Matilda Favor ran a small mercantile in a small town and squirreled away every penny she earned.  The town thought she was pretty batty, considering she consulted her deadhusband's ghost, Charlie, on everything related to the business and her personal life.  When Matilda does something without consulting Charlie, namely helping a ne'er-do-well named Will Cade who was attempting to steal an expensive hairbrush from her store, she tells Will he needs to help in her store to pay off his moral debt to her.  Will is incredibly drawn to Matilda, but he thinks she is still married since she continually talks about Charlie (even though he's been dead for years).  Will isn't who he seems to be, though.  Although he's a gambler now, he was a doctor in the Civil War until personal tragedy caused him to give up his practice.  Can these two lost souls help one another? <br /> <br />I really liked the premise of the story, but the story itself was somewhat a disappointment.  The whole \\"consulting with Charlie's ghost\\" was just weird, I was beginning to wonder if Matilda really was crazy after all.  Will Cade was a much more interesting character, despite Matilda constantly snipping at him and being generally rude.  If Matilda had had some sense and manners, this story would be more enjoyable. <br /> <br />\\"Cowboy Scrooge\\" by Liz Ireland -- 5 stars! <br /> <br />Ivy Ryan headed for a small Texas town to be the mail-order bride of Josiah Murphy, fleeing from her past and convinced men are all jerks.  Upon arriving in Otis, Texas, however, she learns that Josiah is dead, and the town is now thrusting the care of his three orphans into Ivy's less than capable hands.  Ivy discovers that the three orphans, who are bratty beyond belief, have an uncle nearby and is determined to dump them off at his ranch.  Once she meets Justin Murphy, though, Ivy knows that she has her work cut out for her.  Justin shows no interest in the children, and although he does agree to take them, he insists that Ivy stay to take care of the children.  Although each is wary of the other, soon they find romance blooming between them. <br /> <br />This story was, by far, the bestin the book, and is worth the price of the book alone.  The story was wonderful, with a great cast of characters and a surprising level of character development considering it was a short story.  Liz Ireland really made the characters come alive, and the romance between Justin and Ivy was realistic and heart-warming.  It was a wonderful story that made you laugh out loud and left you with that warm fuzzy feeling at the end.  Out of the three stories, this is probably the only one I will read again.	2004-08-07
US	23595366	R167R3J4SGTOGL	0373290012	791206635	By King'S Decree	Books	5	7	7	N	N	The king had granted them a year of love	Ardith of Lenvil had loved Gerard of Wilmont since Gerard's father had asked for a betrothal between Ardith and Gerard.  Ardith's father refused, however, declaring that Ardith had been left barren due to being gored by a wild boar.  Crushed, Ardith lives her life as well as she can under her father's oppressive and critical thumb, knowing that she will never have the man she desires or a family of her own.  Upon meeting Gerard again, however, Ardith begins to hope for the impossible when Gerard returns her interest.  Could the midwife be wrong, could she bear the man she loves an heir? <br /> <br />Gerard is immediately attracted to Ardith, but has no idea that she is considered barren.  He offers for her hand in marriage, and only then is told the horrible news.  Gerard must have an heir, since he is a baron and has no lawful heir yet, although he does have an adorable three-year-old boy named Daymon who was born on the wrong side of the sheets.  He thinks Ardith would be the perfect wife and mother to his young child, and he's not willing to give up on her yet.  When King Henry gives Ardith and Gerard a year to conceive a child, can they accomplish the impossible so they can spend the rest of their lives with each other? <br /> <br />Shari Anton is a wonderful writer, and it's obvious whenever you read one of her stories.  This book earned a solid five stars.  Ardith was a wonderful woman, and a very realistic heroine.  Gerard of Wilmont was also a great hero, full of passion for the woman he loves and fatherly love for his child.  When Ardith and Gerard come together, sparks fly!  The love scenes between the two were very passionate, and their love story was enough to make your heart melt.  They faced so many obstacles when it came to their love - the king's decree, the possibility that Ardith might be barren, Gerard's enemy Basil of Northbrye who is intent on destroying Wilmont and all he holds dear, Gerard's overbearing shrew of a mother - but nothing stops them from loving one another. <br /> <br />I read this book because I started reading other books in the Wilmont series and wanted to see how Gerard and Ardith got together.  I definitely wasn't disappointed in this book.  The other titles in the series (in order) are: Lord of the Manor (Richard and Lucinda), By Queen's Grace (Corwin and Judith), and Knave of Hearts (Stephen and Marian).  All of the books are great reads, and I've thoroughly enjoyed reading the series (although I read them out of order!).	2004-08-06
US	23595366	RHEBIHPDS40XG	037329316X	453329507	A Scandalous Situation	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Her past was a dark country...	Iantha Kethley's life had been ruined beyond repair.  Raped at the tender age of 18, Iantha now fears the touch of anyone who is not a child.  Her dreams for children of her own have been ripped from her, for even if she could find a man to marry her, she could not bear the thought of him touching her.  Then, one snowy night, her carriage is caught in a snowdrift, and a most intriguing man stops to help her.  He's everything she fears - very masculine and very tall with broad shoulders - and as she holds a gun on him to keep him from coming any closer, she has no idea that he may be everything she needs to move on with her life. <br /> <br />Robert Armstrong, Lord Duncan, had no idea why the woman insisted on holding a gun at him when his only intention was to help her.  And help her he does - not only does he rescue her horse and Iantha herself, but he offers her shelter from the storm brewing outside in his home.  While he gets to know her, the gentle widower is thoroughly intrigued by Iantha, and makes a plan to offer for her once he returns her to her home.  Iantha's dreams appear to be coming true, until the madmen who raped her six years ago begin to step up the threatening messages sent to her.  They swear they'll kill her, only after they rape her once more.  Can Rob protect the woman he loves, both from herself and from the men who are bent on destroying them both? <br /> <br />To be honest, I cried through most of this book because I related with Iantha so much.  Having endured an ordeal similar to Iantha's (without a Rob at my side, unfortunately), I could relate to her every emotion and reaction.  The author did an absolutely wonderful job of exploring Iantha's reactions to Rob, and really knew how difficult it is to pick up the pieces and try to move on with your life after this has happened to you.  Rob was wonderful - considerate, compassionate, and understanding of Iantha's limitations and fears.  He never tried to push her into something she didn'twant to do, but instead usually stayed back and let Iantha take the lead in their relationship.  As for Iantha, she was a fragile but tenacious beauty, and I admired her courage and strength.  The love scenes between the two were aching tender as well as wildly passionate.   <br /> <br />The only thing that detracted from the story was the villains who still wanted to make Iantha's life miserable and kept threatening her at every turn.  Sometimes that plot took away from the tender love story developing between Rob and Iantha.  Had the author wrote a book dealing just with Rob and Iantha's relationship, with no evil men shadowing them, I think I would have rated the book five stars.  Still, this book is wonderful, and shows the true healing power of love.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep, heartfelt stories that go way beyond the mere fluff often found on the romance market.	2004-08-06

Having been married to a philanderer and a child abuser, she vowed to never make that mistake again. Her intention was to just enjoy one summer of luxury, a summer where she swapped identities with her rich friend, Elizabeth Carlyle. So when she met Matthew Dixon, she was more than a little weary of him. Not only was he a man, and a very attractive one at that, but he was a lawyer. Not just any lawyer, either, but the successful son of Lawrence Dixon, the man who was responsible for getting Sierra's ex-husband a slap on the wrist for child abuse charges. Still, there's a connection between Sierra and Matt that just won't go away, so Sierra wonders how much harm a summer fling could bring. <br />  <br /> Matt Dixon is skeptical of marriage and relationships thanks to his parents. His mother had walked out on him and his sister when he was only 10, and although his father had tried to be a decent parent, he wasn't very good at it and his work always took first place in his life. Matt is determined to not be like his father at all. He doesn't want to marry until he's 35, he definitely doesn't want to raise anyone else's children, and he doesn't know if he even wants his own kids. He's drawn to Elizabeth Carlyle, who prefers the nickname Sierra, but only for a summer fling. He finds himself increasingly drawn to Sierra, but he can't help but wonder what she's hiding from him. <br />  <br /> I really thought this book sounded good at first, but I was very disappointed upon reading the book. The book opens up with Sierra declaring that she'll never even notice another man, and then what happens a few paragraphs later? She's interested in another man. How chiche and flighty. This book was surprising - it was much more risque and sexual than other Love Inspired books I've read. There's mention of premarital sex (although Sierra's against it, Matt sees nothing wrong with it), sexually transmitted diseases, and a lot of very passionate kissing. That doesn't bother me, but I can imagine it'd bother some. <br />  <br /> What did bother me was Sierra. I thought that I would identify with her, but I never did. She kept saying how her faith prevented her from having sex outside of marriage, but obviously her faith didn't prevent her from being a liar. She lied about many things - her real name, her real mother, her real father, where she lived. She kept her daughter's identity a secret from Matt, and told Matt she was &quot;babysitting&quot; a child when really she was spending time with her own daughter. I cannot IMAGINE keeping my daughter a secret from someone I was dating. My daughter is my world. <br />  <br /> And, of course, when the lies eventually were discovered, Sierra and her friend Libby acted like it was all Matt's fault and that he had no right to be upset. Yeah, sure. Let me see...if I thought I had fallen in love with someone, and it turns out that nearly everything he had ever told me was a lie, I'd be very upset too! I really felt sorry for poor Matt. He could be a jerk sometimes, but he really got the raw end of the deal. <br />  <br /> There are other things that annoyed me about the book, but Sierra's duplicity was my main beef. Believe me, you're not missing anything if you don't read this book.	2004-08-04

Her royal blood meant that she would be a pawn in the King's hands, married off to the man Henry chose for her.  Judith dreamed of a love match, the kind of marriage her friend Ardith had.  Still, she knew this wasn't likely and spent her days in a convent, not by choice.  In an effort to rebel a bit from the convent's strict ways, Judith goes out of the walls to pick herbs and is kidnapped.  Once again, her royal blood is proven a curse because the men responsible for kidnapping her want her to marry their lord, a man determined to take over England and make Judith his queen!  Still, Judith is not alone.  The man who she loves, Corwin of Wilmont, is there to protect her.  Still again, her royal blood proves a curse, for no matter how much she desires to marry Corwin, a royal heiress could never marry a Saxon knight! <br /> <br />Corwin of Wilmont was attracted to Judith and was determined to protect the feisty heiress from harm.  Pretending to join the rebels who kidnapped Judith, Corwin is determined to discover who is trying to overthrow the King and save the kingdom from a bloody civil war.  If he is successful in thwarting the rebellion, Corwin knows that King Henry will gladly reward him with land and coin, but the only reward Corwin desires is the one he can never have - Lady Judith as his wife! <br /> <br />This book had everything and I found it very difficult to put it down!  Judith was a wonderful heroine, feisty and opinionated, yet tender as well.  Corwin was a perfect hero - brave, talented, kind, and willing to risk his life for the woman he loved.  There was intrigue, a bit of a mystery, attempted rebellions, and court politics all woven into a tender and heartwarming love story.  I have become a great fan of Shari Anton's work, and this book is definitely up there with the other books by Ms. Anton that I have read.   <br /> <br />For those interested, there are several inter-related books by Ms. Anton.  There is By King's Decree (Gerard and Ardith's story), Lord of the Manor (Richard and Lucinda), By Queen's Grace (this one), and Knave of Hearts (Stephen and Marian's story).  I've read three of these now, and each of the books have been excellent!  Ms. Anton really has a gift for writing wonderful romances.	2004-08-03
US	23595366	ROQCBDK5QQN3O	037319711X	302033636	Dylan's Last Dare (Silhouette Romance # 1711) (The Texas Brotherhood)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	He never turned down a challenge	Dylan &quot;The Devil&quot; Gentry had been a champion bullrider with women flocking toward him - until his debilitating accident. Now bound to a wheelchair and believing he'll never walk again, much less ride a bull again, Dylan lives on his brother's ranch and has been chasing away all of his physical therapists. That is, until determined Brenna Farren showed up as his door and refused to be chased away. Dylan found himself very attracted to the pretty red-head, but her only concern seemed to be getting him to walk again. Dylan loves a challenge, and he definitely sees Brenna as one! <br />  <br /> Brenna Farren needed this job. A new graduate, she was pregnant and alone. Her worthless boyfriend had been killed in a hang-gliding accident, and now she alone was going to have to care for her baby. She didn't need any more complications, especially Dylan, with his dangerous eyes and warm embrace. She knew it wouldn't be long until everyone found out about her pregnancy, but she was more than surprised when Dylan offered to marry her in order to give her child a name. Shocked into complying, Brenna wonders what she has gotten herself into! <br />  <br /> This book was pretty good, but almost seemed antiquated with its theme. Marrying temporarily to give the baby a last name? The threat of a shotgun wedding if the man doesn't do right by someone's daughter? That seems like something I'd read in a historical novel, not a contemporary one. The whole Gentry/Randell clan was more than confusing. I suppose if you've read all of the Texas Brotherhood books, you'd be able to understand it, but I got bogged down in all of the names and all of the characters that were left with little introduction, as if I was supposed to know who they were already.  <br />  <br /> Dylan was a pretty good guy. Brenna was a bit too co-dependent and whiny for my tastes. She was determined to change Dylan, and I'm of the opinion that a woman should never enter a relationship with the intent of changing her man. The baby's true father was barely mentioned, and for Brenna supposedly loving him, she didn't seem too broken up over his death. Brenna's fury over Dylan chasing his dream of bull riding, however, got on my last nerve. She knew before she even met him that he wanted to go back to bull riding, and yet she acted really surprised and hurt when it happened. Of course, the message of the book was if a man loves a woman enough, he'll give up what he loves, but I just don't think that's healthy. <br />  <br /> Despite the cliches and all of the characters that were tossed at the reader, the book was still fairly good. I may read it again. It'd be a lot easier to follow if you've read the rest of the books in the series, however.	2004-08-02

She gambled, she had dubious friends, and her reputation was nearly beyond repair.  So when she presented herself nearly naked at a bachelor party and found herself staring into the eyes of a stranger, Juliana was surprised that she actually felt embarrassed by her actions.  Upon examining herself further, she began to realize the reasons for her shocking behavior.  She rebelled against her father, who never loved her; love, which had left her heart-broken; her mother, who had deserted her family and never looked back; and society in general, with its snobbish attitudes.  And all because of the look of a stranger... <br /> <br />Martin Davencourt was no stranger to Lady Juliana, but she didn't remember that.  They had met while in their teens.  Martin had been drawn to her beauty then, but he was even more drawn to the shocking widow now.  For although everyone else saw a woman with loose morals and hideous behavior, he saw the innocent, vulnerable girl she had once been.  He fought his attraction for her viciously, but he was still drawn to this incredible woman.  Could stuffy Martin, an aspiring politician, and shocking Lady Juliana truly make a match? <br /> <br />The book opened up with a heartbreaking scene from Juliana's childhood, and that scene gave much insight into Juliana's character.  I felt an immediate bonding with Juliana's character, and therefore never saw truly her as the wicked, scandalous widow.  Juliana had never been secure in love, for her father loved her not, her mother had deserted her, her first husband had died, and her second husband had left her and died in a prison stabbing.  With so much heartbreak in her life, it was no wonder Juliana reacted so. <br /> <br />Martin was an interesting character, as well.  Although he was a bit stuffy at first, he did have an overwhelming attraction to Juliana.  Once he saw past her scandalous facade, he saw who she really was and wanted to protecther from herself.  Their love story was entirely credible, and I felt that this was something that could have almost really happened, once upon a time.  The characters seemed so real. <br /> <br />I initially thought the ending was going to be hokey and a horrible ending to the book, but I really did feel at the end that the ending was brilliant.  It was poetic justice to the extreme, and brought a real sense of finality to the book.  For those who enjoyed the character of Juliana, she also appeared in two of Nicola Cornick's previous books: The Earl's Prize and The Chaperone Bride.  Altogether, this book was a wonderful read, and I see myself reading it again in the future.	2004-08-02

She'd moved on with her life and tried to put those dark memories behind her, but they still haunted her from time to time, like when she looked up into the handsome face of Sherrif Cameron Durango.  Cameron had seen her when she was at her weakest, and she didn't want to be reminded of that.  Still, Cameron was hanging around her stables pretty frequently since he wanted a horse, and Kendra had to be nice to her customers... <br /> <br />Despite Kendra's gruff exterior, Cameron knew there was a heart beneath begging to be loved.  He'd seen one of the worst moments of her life, but had managed to help her through it.  Cameron had lived with his share of pain, having lost his beloved wife to cancer four years ago, but he wanted to move on with his life, and he thought he could do that with Kendra if she'd give him a chance.  He'd do all in his power to show her that not all men were the same, and that he'd be willing to stand by her and protect her for a lifetime. <br /> <br />I initially connected with Kendra more than Cameron, since I'd been in a similar situation to Kendra.  Kendra was going through a lot of hurt, and being around Cameron only brought the wounds to the surface.  About halfway through the book, however, I began to identify more with Cameron.  He was such a good guy, and Kendra treated him very shabbily, yet he continued to try and win her heart.  He was one of those men you read about but never meet in person ;)  Anyway, Cameron was about perfect.  He was loving, patient, considerate, and protective (but not overwhelmingly so).   <br /> <br />Kendra's past comes to the reader bit by bit, but is confusing because there is never a point in the story where the author puts all those bits together.  I mean, I figured out the gist of what happened to her, but it was never very clear.  That is my only complaint (aside from Kendra's behavior, which is fairly understandable, however) with the book.  The book really flowed and was an interesting read.  I'd recommend it to any fans of romantic Christian fiction.	2004-08-02

Jake Montgomery had already survived one bad marriage, and danged if he was going to get hitched again. He had his little girl, Annie Jane, to take care of, and that was about all the female influence he wanted or needed in his life. Besides, Jake was convinced that he was incapable of being a good husband, and the ghosts of his past are haunting him. So Jake's content enough to just be a father and work on his struggling ranch - that is, until he finds a bride strung up on his barbed wire fence!        Madeline Tate was leaving Vegas in a hurry, after her no-good fiance ditched her at the altar and took off with all her luggage. The only thing she had to wear was her wedding dress, and she was in such a hurry to get away from Vegas that she didn't care if people were staring - and didn't notice that her gas tank was hovering dangerously near E until it was too late. After finding herself snared upon a barbed wire fence, she feels an attraction for her rugged rescuer, Jake Montgomery. Jake makes it abundantly clear, however, that he doesn't want Madeline hanging around for long. Only when his daughter, Annie Jane, takes a shining to her does Jake relent and ask Maddie to stay for a few weeks and help out with his daughter. Can Maddie convince Jake in those few weeks that he'd make a perfect husband, or will both of them leave with broken hearts?        I really enjoyed this book. Madeline was pretty confident despite being a ditched bride, and Jake was delectable despite the ghosts of his past. Annie Jane was adorable, despite her penchant for mischief, and they made a great family of three - if only Jake would realize it! :) The townspeople were really funny and added a lot of character to this book. I often found myself laughing out loud after reading something, or groaning in embarrassment for one of the characters.  The author leaves you guessing about what exactly is eating at Jake for quite some time, and is skilled at weaving an emotional tale that will tug at your heartstrings. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a heartwarming, yet funny, love story.	2004-08-02

They had explored their lust for one another, and after Stephen left Marian had found herself pregnant. Her father demanded she tell him the baby's father, but Marian refused and was forced from her home. She took refuge with her uncle William and cousin Carolyn. Now, for nearly six years, Marian has lived in a small hut with her two twin daughters, Audra and Lyssa, eking out a peaceful and simple life for them. Marian's peaceful world shatters, however, once she discovers that Stephen is courting her beautiful cousin Carolyn, and she wonders if she made the right decision six years ago when she had not told Stephen of his daughters. <br />  <br /> Stephen had no idea that he had two daughters. In fact, he had had no idea that Carolyn and Marian, his first love, were related until after he started pursuing Carolyn. Marian had been his first love, but he thought that Carolyn would make a suitable wife. Stephen loved to travel and detested being tied to any woman, and Carolyn was accepting of that. Still, once he saw Marian again his heart was drawn only to her and her beautiful twin daughters. Could he truly marry one cousin while being in love with the other? <br />  <br /> I read this book because it was a sequel to Ms. Anton's &quot;Lord of the Keep.&quot; Although this book was also good, it didn't match &quot;Lord of the Keep's&quot; appeal to me. Still, it was a good read. Stephen, the wandering soul, finds himself wanting to be tied down to his first love, after all, but wonders if he'll make a suitable husband and father. Marian doesn't want to crush Stephen's wandering spirit, and fears that he will only grow to resent her and the children if he must marry her and settle down. Several characters in the book appeared in other novels by Ms. Anton, most notably Gerard, Ardith, and Richard. Both Stephen and Marian visibly grew in depth during the tale, so it was interesting to watch them blossom. This book is a fine addition to any historical novel library.	2004-08-02

Yet Richard found himself in the awkward position of being the protector of Lucinda's son, Philip. With Lucinda and Philip in tow, Richard returned to his holdings, the holdings that had once suffered from the cruelty of Lucinda's husband. Despite Lucinda being his enemy's widow, however, Richard is insanely attracted to the brave woman. Can he ever forget whose wife she was, and make her his wife now? <br />  <br /> Lady Lucinda had known the meaning of suffering. She had been married to a cruel man who beat her regularly, her family cared nothing for her, and she had gone into hiding after her husband's death to protect her son from his greedy relatives. When she petitions the court for a protector for her son, she has no idea that it will be Richard, one of the men her husband nearly killed! Richard had been kind to her while traveling, before he knew who she was, but she saw the glint of hardness in his eyes upon learning who she had married. Can she convince this man that her son is not like his father, and convince the people that she is not responsible for her husband's crimes? <br />  <br /> I enjoyed this book immensely. Shari Anton has a gift of creating realistic, likeable characters woven into thrilling stories. Reading this book was almost like being transported back in time and watching love blossom between two real individuals. Both of these characters had faults - Richard was a bit too hard-headed, and Lucinda was a bit too aloof - but that only made them more believable and more interesting. Characters from some of her other stories, most notably Gerard and Ardith from &quot;By King's Decree,&quot; appeared in the story, as well, but the reader was left with a desire to read their stories, as well. I really can't praise this book enough - it is one of my favorite historical romances of all time now! <br />  <br /> For those interested, other books in this series include: By King's Decree (Gerard and Ardith), By Queen's Grace (Corwin and Judith), and Knave of Hearts (Stephen and Marian). I plan on reading them all! :)	2004-08-02

While Cassie had been the loving and devoted wife, Tom had neglected to tell her that he was already married to another woman.  Now, with Tom dead and his deception still fresh in her mind, Cassie is determined to steer clear of men.  But when she is about to give birth on the side of a road and the only helper available is a man, she has to rethink her plan to keep men out of her life, especially this good looking sheriff who makes her heart flutter!<br />Sheriff Noah Wheeler was a notorious commitment-phobe, but when he helped bring Cassie's beautiful twin girls into the world, he couldn't help but feel an instant connection with them and their gorgeous mother.  Still, Noah knew that he wasn't what Cassie and her twins needed.  She needed a forever kind of guy, a man who wasn't afraid of commitment, and that just wasn't Noah.  He'd already experienced one bad marriage, thank you very much, and there was no way he was willing to walk down the aisle again, no matter how much he adored Cassie and her daughters!<br />Quite frankly, this book was not very good.  The only redeeming graces in the entire book were the characters of Noah - a truly good guy, who was determined to do right as much as he could - and Brenda, a feisty waitress who stuck up for Noah when no one else in the town did.  Cassie was a real jerk, I never grew to like her.  She was a man-hater, through and through, and although I may be able to understand why she would be upset, that's no excuse for treating Noah worse than a dog.   <br />The entire support group for Noah's ex-loves was childish.  Apparently it was supposed to be funny, that Noah's exes all got together and commiserated about how evil Noah was, but honestly, it wasn't funny at all.  It was completely petty.  Noah seemed to have a tendency to date psychotic women, and I felt quite sorry for him.  His exes were so bitter towards him because he didn't marry them, butI can't see why he would want to marry them!  One of his exes complained that Noah had strung her along by preferring to stay at home instead of double-dating (his ex said Noah was supposedly trying out 'married life' by doing so) and by taking her to an event where there was children (his ex said Noah was supposedly trying to show her how good he was with kids).  Umm, hello?  What planet is this woman from, and how did she ever arrive to those conclusions when Noah had meant no such thing?  This book gave women a bad name.<br />The fact is, all of the women in Noah's life KNEW that he was marriage-shy, and yet treated him like he was the scum of the earth because he didn't marry them.  I felt incredibly sorry for Noah, especially since most of the town seemed to agree with his psychotic exes.  Even worse, Noah started agreeing with them on how horrible of a person he was because he wasn't married.  This book is really geared toward those who hate men, and although I am many things, I am definitely not a man-hater.  The only reason I could give this book two stars was the fact that I liked Noah's character so much.  This is definitely a book I'll never read again, and I can't recommend it for anyone else to read, either.	2004-07-16
US	23595366	R3E4GNAX6HV3VE	0373197268	334724219	Her Second-Chance Man (Silhouette Romance)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	He'd broken her heart years ago	Brian Kemp had broken Jessica Moran's heart years ago, after he promised to call her but had never followed through with his promise.  To Jessica, the high school misfit, Brian's broken vow was the ultimate sense of betrayal.  Now, fourteen years later, Jessica had changed into a woman who was as beautiful on the outside and she was on the inside.  She'd started her own successful horticulture mail-order business, and things couldn't be going better - until Brian showed up at her door with a dying puppy and his broken-hearted 13-year-old niece.  Jessica hoped she could heal the niece's puppy, but as she looked at Brian, she knew that he needed to be healed from his hurts, too.  <br />Brian Kemp had a gift - or a curse, depending on how you looked at it.  No matter what, no matter how hard he tried, he always saying or doing the wrong things when it came to women.  His niece hated him, he'd messed up when it came to love and relationships more times than he could count, and there he was on Jessica Moran's doorstep, the betrayal shining in her eyes.  He just couldn't win.  Still, when he got to know Jessica better, he realized that the connection he had felt with her many years ago was still there, stronger than ever.  Jessica was something wonderfully unique, and he knew that he would just break her heart again if he ever got involved with her.  That knowledge, however, can't stop his heart from wanting more...<br /> If I could give this book four and a half stars, I would.  Jessica was a wonderful heroine, a forgiving, kind spirit who was often misunderstood by peers, especially in those awkward high school days, but still had an amazing gift of healing.  As for Brian, I didn't have a favorable view of him at first, because of what he had done while he was in high school, but after few chapters, you could really see there was more to him than met the eye.  Although the entire book was in third-person, the author seemed to alternate between giving more details aboutBrian, and then more details about Jessica, which really gave you a better picture of what was happening between them, and what they were both thinking.<br />The only reason I didn't give this book five stars was the fact that the drama at the end of the novel didn't really need to be there.  It almost seemed like it was slapped in there as an afterthought.  That part of the novel was the only part that seemed too predictable and cliched.  The rest of the book was absolutely great, and was a bit different from most romance novels I've read.  I highly recommend this book, and really look forward to reading more from this author.	2004-07-15
US	23595366	RI7WQQ5YKOII	0373218176	654415740	The Man Behind the Mask	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Out of the shadows came her prince...	Dulcinea Samples was just an average girl from Bakersfield, California.  An aspiring writer, Dulcie spent most of her time working at low-paying jobs that helped her survive.  Her best friend, Brit, was now a princess in a tiny kingdom in the Adriatic Sea, and Dulcie was invited to Brit's wedding.  Dulcie thought that her stay in the kingdom would provide her with a great setting to a new novel she planned on writing.  Dulcie had no idea that while in Gullandria she would meet the love of her life - a scarred prince named Valbrand, Brit's brother.<br />Prince Valbrand had gone mad from the terrors that he had faced while at sea, terrors that had left half of his face burned and horribly twisted.  He had survived the attempt on his life, and had returned to Gullandria, unable to pick up where he had left off in his life.  His only thought his consuming need for revenge for his would-be assassins, until he met his sister's American friend, Dulcie.  For the first time in many months, Valbrand found himself happy again, and living again, thanks to Dulcie.  A prince couldn't marry a commoner, so Valbrand's affair with Dulcie would have to be short-lived, unless love found a way.<br />I absolutely loved this book.  I tried to start reading the book a few times, but I always got hung up in the first chapter when Dulcie chatters with little rhyme or reason about falling in love, dickies, and her life in California.  Once you get past the first chapter, though, things are much improved.  I could hardly bear to put the book down after the first chapter!  <br />Something unusual about this book is the fact that it is written entirely in first person, with Dulcie and Valbrand each narrating parts of the story.  It can be a bit confusing to follow at times, but it really gives a depth to the story that wouldn't have otherwise been there.  It offers the opportunity to really see inside the heads of these characters and to see what makes them tick, or what makes them take a particular action.  It almost felt like two dear friends were telling me the story of how they met, from their own perspectives.<br />Dulcie was an interesting heroine - not as assertive as her friend, Brit, but definitely brave in her own way.  She was also not the typical heroine.  She was not a svelte supermodel with a perfect body.  She had red hair that she hated and she thought she was too heavy, and a couple of the other characters in the book called her fat.  Valbrand was an incredible hero - strong, yet vulnerable, and incredibly sexy despite his scarred face.  <br />This book was a perfect blend for those romance readers who love historical and contemporary novels.  Although the book was set in the present, it really had an air of being swept back in time.  The book really had everything - humor, tender scenes, adventure, suspense, and most of all, a breath-taking love story.  It really reminded me a bit of Susan Kay's 'Phantom,' with the scarred hero, the enchanting heroine, the mystery surrounding the hero, the labyrinth of tunnels, a presumably doomed romance, etc.  This book was just incredible, and I can definitely see myself reading this book again in the future, probably several times over.	2004-07-14

Peta and Liam Farrell had married a year ago with the express purpose of not falling in love.  The only two things that held their marriage together was their desire to have a child and the incredible passion that existed between them.  So when Peta found herself falling in love with her husband of convenience, she knew she was in trouble.  How could she give him a child, knowing that she and Liam didn't love one another like they should love one another?  She despaired of ever gaining Liam's love, and the prospect of always loving Liam without him loving her back was almost enough to tear her up inside.<br />Liam had been hurt all of his life, so he didn't need love, or at least, that is what he told himself.  If he was honest with himself, his feelings for Peta were beyond anything he had ever imagined they could be.  But after a year of marriage, and with no baby on the way, Liam was wondering if he was unable to have children, and he couldn't stand the thought of not being able to give Peta what she wanted so badly.  Then, just a few days before Christmas, a baby appeared on Liam and Peta's doorstep - maybe this baby could bring Peta and Liam together, close enough to admit their love for one another!<br />I really enjoyed this book.  Peta was so torn between her love for Liam and the belief that she would do her baby a disservice by bringing it into a loveless marriage.  Liam was a wonderful enigma, a man who believed that he didn't need love, but soon realized that no matter what he told himself, he really needed Peta, although he couldn't admit that to her.  The passion between the two was unbelievable, almost enough to singe your fingers as you read the book.  My only complaint about the book was the fact that Liam and Peta said some awfully hurtful things they didn't mean to one another.  I'm talking about things that were almost painful to read.  Their argument lasted for several pages, and it was difficult to read because they were so vicious to one another.  Other than that, I enjoyed this book immensely, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to read a passionate, seductive romance.	2004-07-13

Karen Downing wakes up in a strange hospital bed in Rio de Janeiro with a dark, brooding man by her side.  The man promptly informs her that she is his wife of three months, but Karen can't remember the last three months of her life for anything.  The man also informs her that she had left him for another man.  Karen can hardly believe that she would cheat on her husband - especially a man such as handsome and virile as this one - but then again, she can hardly believe that she'd marry a man she didn't even know for a week!  When her husband takes her back to the home they had shared, will Karen be able to remember the reason she ran away from this man?<br />Luiz Andrade couldn't believe that his wife had left him for a sniveling jerk, but she apparently had.  Luiz didn't believe in divorce, though, so he went after his wife, and had found her in a hospital, apparently devoid of her memories of him.  Despite the fact that he can't get the picture of her in the arms of another man out of his mind, he is determined to make this marriage work, whether Karen wants it to or not.  There has never been a divorce in the Andrade family, and he won't be the first to get one!  The passion is still there between them, but Luiz doesn't trust it, and doesn?t trust her, either.  Can their marriage be saved?<br />I enjoyed this book a great deal.  I was intrigued from the first page of the book, and I wouldn't put it down until I had finished the story!  There was definite tension throughout most of the book while Karen wondered why she had left the man of her dreams, and the reader keeps guessing along with her.  I was surprised once the reason she left was revealed, which is a rare thing since I usually figure out the 'surprise' endings before I read half of the book.  Not this time!  I also enjoyed the tension between Luiz and Karen, because the attraction was obviously still there even though her memories of him weren't there.  <br />The only reason I gave this book only four stars was the fact that Luiz was too domineering for my tastes.  He was sexy, yes, and he was also intriguing, but he believed that his wife had to do exactly what he said at all times.  I felt like he was treating Karen like a child instead of a wife and an equal.  The ending of the book also left several loose ends, the epilogue tried to tie them up but I just wasn't satisfied at how rushed the ending of the book was.  Still, this book was a great read, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a quick, interesting romance.	2004-07-11

She wanted to fix up her house, which was in horrible shape, but didn't have much money.  That's why Dan Holden seemed like such a godsend to her.  The former marine had returned to his hometown, and he was an excellent carpenter.  As Becca grew to know Dan, though, she knew he was hiding something - she just couldn't figure out quite what it was yet.<br />Daniel Holden had lost his hearing in an explosion while in the military.  He had returned to his hometown to lick his wounds and to get his life back on track, but he hid his deafness from the townspeople.  Once Becca discovers his problem, however, Dan wonders why he was ever keeping his deafness a secret to begin with.  As Dan works on Becca's house, he grows very attached to her two children - and to Becca herself.  Dan had pledged to stay single and alone once he lost his hearing, but the more time he spent with Becca, the more he was questioning the wisdom of his decision!<br />This book was pretty good.  I liked the character of Dan, although I wondered why he had lost the ability to make a complete sentence once he was deaf.  I spent part of my nursing clinicals working with hearing impaired individuals, and none of them had lost their grammar once they lost their hearing.  Dan's ability to lip read was also way too good - even experienced lip readers can make mistakes or not follow some conversations well, especially at long distances.  Still, I liked Dan, because he was sincere, and thought of others instead of being completely self-centered.<br />I didn't care so much for Becca.  She was a fair enough character, but the fact that she thought a mere 21 months without a man in her life was a long time almost made me laugh out loud.  Her faith was simplistic, almost too simple and childish at times.  Furthermore, Becca was sometimes mean to Dan in an attempt to push him away, and I just didn't care much for her.  The only thing I could say about her is that she was a good mother.  That's about all I liked in Becca.  <br />This book was focused a lot on God, so if you are less spiritually inclined, you may want to skip this one.  The book was pleasant enough to read, but seemed too unrealistic some of the time.  If you enjoy a quick, easy read, this may be the book for you, but if you are looking for something to sink your teeth into, you may want to pass this one over.	2004-07-11

Lord Lucas Fox had spent the past decade in political exile from England, as he had remained loyal to the crown instead of Cromwell's Protectorate.  During his years of exile, Lord Fox had managed to acquire quite a fortune, but also suffered from treachery that almost left him dead.  With King Charles II now securely on the throne, Lord Fox returned to England in triumph, determined to weed out those who would assassinate Lucas.  While riding his horse in a welcoming parade, Lord Fox spies the most beautiful woman he had seen in quite some time and pulls her upon his horse to kiss her.  He later learns that the woman is the youngest sister of his close friend, Thomas Fairworthy, and that the more Lucas grows to know the bewitching young woman, the more determined Lucas is to make her his bride!<br />Prudence Fairworthy had held a torch for her brother's friend, Adam, and had hoped that Adam would notice that she had turned into a woman during his absence.  Adam, however, is married now, and Prudence feels the pangs of a broken heart.  She also feels vexed by her brother Thomas' friend, Lord Fox, who seems to ignite her temper every time she sees him.  Everyone warns her that he is nothing but a rake - but what will she do when she discovers that he has marriage on his mind?<br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  I was caught up in the story from the first page.  There was such a wealth of details and history in this book, I almost felt like I had been transported back in time and was actually watching the story unfold with my very eyes.  Unlike many books that have a lot of details, the details were not overwhelming and only served to enhance the story itself.  <br />The only reasons I didn't give this book five stars were the tempers of Lord Fox and Prudence.  Prudence acted like a spoiled, selfish little girl, and she seemed to delight in causing trouble for her brother Thomas and for Lord Fox himself.  She spent so much of her time berating everyone that I couldn't form an attachment to her character.  As for Lord Fox, he was often considerate and charming, but sometimes he flew off the wall for no reason and made Prudence's life, and those around him, very unpleasant.  He seemed to enjoy scolding her, often for behavior that is typical for a teenager.  <br />Still, I enjoyed this book immensely, and if I could give it four and a half stars, I would.  The sexual tension between Lord Fox and Prudence is tangible and you can almost feel the sparks when you touch the book.  So if you enjoy a Regency romance filled with history, adventure, and romance, I am sure you will not be disappointed in this book.	2004-07-11

Adam was so confident of his skills, however, that he was arrogant to a fault.  He made sure that the nurses, technicians, and other staff members knew they were below him, the mighty surgeon.  When someone shot Adam, nearly killing him, Adam begins to rethink everything, including his cocky attitude, his faith, and his feelings for Nurse Darling.<br />Nurse Kate Darling had been on the stinging side of Adam's cruel barbs, but she still found herself caring for him more than she liked to admit.  After being flown back to Colorado Springs, she stays by his bed as much as she can, desperate to make sure that Adam is going to recover.  It seems that his would-be assassin has followed him back to Colorado Springs, however, as Adam nearly dies a few more times.  Not only does Kate need to sort out her feelings for Adam, but she needs to discover who wants to kill Adam - before it's too late.<br />This book was a bit different from the usual Love Inspired fare, as 'Adam's Promise' is a romantic suspense novel.  Unfortunately, I was able to figure out who the 'bad guy' was within the first few pages of the book, and the 'bad guy' was given away several times before the actual revelation of his identity (I won't give it away, but I can say he's a he because the author mentions it many times over).  If I hadn't been able to guess who he was, though, it would have been more suspenseful.  There are even a few passages when the 'bad guy' is talking, so you can see his thoughts and you can even feel a bit worried for Adam and Kate in the process.<br />Adam is really annoying at first with his 'I'm better than everyone here' attitude, but he eventually loses the attitude and becomes pleasant enough.  Kate is the more spiritual one of the two, but she's troubled with her 'past.'  I didn't really see what she was so worried about.  Yes, Adam came from money, and yes, Kate had a rough childhood, but quite honestly, her past was completely mild and tame compared to what I went through growing up, so I don't know why she made such a huge production over it.  She needed to grow up a bit and get some self-esteem while she was at it.<br />Still, the book was rather entertaining to read.  There were frequent mentions of Jesus and God for those who like that in an inspirational romance.  This book is the first in a series of six, I don?t know if I am going to read the rest of them, but 'Adam's Promise' was good enough to stand on its own.	2004-07-01

Nicki had stopped believing in fairy tales the day her mother walked out on her family with $800 she stole from the church building fund. Instead, Nicki was painfully practical - she'd marry her neighbor, Lester, and she'd stay in Dry Creek for the rest of her days on her land, the only thing that could never abandon her. One day, though, a handsome man in a tuxedo showed up on her front lawn with a white limo and an engagement ring...and Nicki was left wondering if fairy tales really did come true sometimes, after all.<br />Garrett Hamilton wasn't a forever kind of guy. Growing up with an alcoholic father who didn't care about him at all had left Garrett without any knowledge of how marriage was supposed to be. Garrett was content to drive all across the country in his big rig. But when he helped out his cousin Chrissy by offering to serve as a temporary chauffer for her friend, Garrett met Nicki Redfern, the only woman in his life to ever make him seriously reconsider his carefree bachelor ways. <br />This book was really an amusing little tale about the whole town of Dry Creek trying to match up two people around the Thanksgiving holiday. I laughed out loud several times while reading this book, especially at the antics of the townspeople trying to throw Garrett and Nicki together. Both Nicki and Garrett had had a lot of hurt in their lives, and I could relate to both of them in different ways. Nicki's way of dealing with her hurt was to give up on her dreams, while Garrett's way of dealing with the pain was being afraid of commitment. Both Nicki and Garrett grew emotionally, although we watched more of Nicki's transformation than Garrett's. <br />Although this book is classified as inspirational, there is little mention of God anywhere, so if you are less spiritually-inclined but still enjoy reading a fun, clean romance, this is the book for you. You'll laugh and be left with a smile as you read this book.The book also has cameos of several couples who have had their own books previously, and there is another book about Reno (Nicki's brother) called &quot;A Baby for Dry Creek.&quot; Altogether, this is a wonderfully quick and quirky read.	2004-06-30

Carson's wife and daughter had been brutally murdered, and Carson had been shot in the back, once Carson's cover was blown, and he was sure Alex, his former DEA partner, was behind the shootings.  Carson had seen Alex with the gun in his hand, and now all Carson wanted was to get justice for his family.  Alex is a wily fellow, though, heavily involved in a biker gang known as Hade's Claws.  So when Brenna Lupe claims to be Alex's sister, and potentially has information on her brother;s whereabouts, Carson has no choice but to take her with him.<br />Brenna Lupe is worried about her twin brother, Alex.  She hasn;t heard from him in six months, and she knows that he;s in trouble.  So she seeks out Carson Turner in an attempt to find her brother.  It isn;t long before the bullets are whizzing by their heads, though, and Brenna realizes just how much trouble her brother, Carson, and she are in.  While hunting for Alex, Brenna feels a growing attraction for Carson, but she knows that nothing permanent can ever come out of it.  Carson is a hollow soul searching for vengeance, and Brenna carries with her a secret that she is sure will drive him away - Brenna and her brother Alex are shape shifters.  They must guard their secret carefully, for if the outside world ever discovers that there are wolves among them, the results could be catastrophic for The Pack.<br />This book was one of the best books I have read all year.  I loved the paranormal element to the story, and I do hope that Intimate Moments carries more paranormal stories in the future.  Brenna is a tough, no-nonsense woman who can take care of herself, which I really liked.  She definitely wasn't the weak heroine and she was more than capable of defending herself and those she loved.  Carson, although a hollow shell of his former self because of the tragedy that befell his family, was still a tough, yet sensitive, hero who grew strongeremotionally as the book progressed.  The plot itself was fast-paced and never lagged, and the reader was always left wondering if Alex had really been involved in the deaths of Carson's family, and also wondering who exactly were the bad guys trying to kill Carson and Brenna.  The tension in the book was so thick you could feel it, and the story left you guessing until almost the very end.  I really hope to read more from this author, and I hope for a sequel to this book using some of the characters introduced.  Easily five-star material, this book is an incredible thrill ride that will leave you wanting more stories from this author!	2004-06-25

Daddy (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1602)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Stranded in a blinding snowstorm, pregnant and alone	Dan Sorenson was alone in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, healing from being shot in the leg in the line of duty.  When a blinding snowstorm comes, he leaves the light on - and discovers a very pregnant, nearly frozen woman standing on his doorstep.  His immediate reaction is to warm her up, but he then discovers she's in labor.  Dan delivers her baby and manages to take care of mother and daughter while Fay recovers.  He's immediately drawn to the little baby, and the baby's mother as well.<br />Fay Merriweather was immensely glad that she had found Dan Sorenson's cabin.  Without him, surely she and her baby would have died out in the wilderness.  She fights her attraction for him, blaming it on close proximity and her gratitude towards him.  Her baby's father had died of leukemia, and she's determined to never marry or have any more children.  So when it's time to go back to her hometown, will she be able to put Dan out of her life for good?<br />This book was okay.  I really liked the character of Dan, because he seemed so real.  He was also patient, kind, and just about everything you'd want in a romantic hero.  Fay, on the other hand, was not so likeable.  No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't bring myself to like her.  She was very childish.  She held grudges against people for an unhealthy length of time.  She refuses to get involved with anyone who she doesn't view as ambitious enough, because she likes the power and money that comes with it.  She looks down on anyone who she doesn't think is ambitious enough when it comes to their jobs, regardless how happy they are with their jobs.  She was also completely irrational.  She was complaining that Dan didn't call her for a week, but never did it even enter her mind that she could call him.  In fact, through the entire book, I don't think she ever called him, she always relied on him to call her, and then she'd complain when he didn't call her when she wanted!  She was very emotionally insecure and insanely jealous for no reason.  She also refused to tell Dan that she had named her baby after him, for no good reason at all.  It was really tiring to read about Fay.<br />Other than Fay, the book's characters were pretty good.  I liked Fay's father, who Fay seemed to dislike for most of the book because he had tried to talk her into getting an abortion (he was only doing it because he was afraid of all the stress that would come with being a single parent).  I also liked Nell, Fay's father's companion, although Fay seemed to dislike her because her father was showing interest in anyone.  I really wanted to shake some sense into Fay.  She was supposed to be a grown woman, not some petulant child who sulked because everything didn't go her way.   Altogether, the book was a three-star story.  It would have rated higher if Fay would have acted like an adult, but sadly enough, that never happened.	2004-06-23

Max had married someone else, though, and had left Amarillo, Texas.  Now, several years later, Max has returned to help run his mother's diner while she recuperates from a broken leg, and Lily finds herself still in love with Max, and loving Max's little boy Nate, too.  Max, however, had given up on his faith in God, and Lily longs to show Max that God is always there for him, through good times and bad.  As obstacles come into their path, though, can Max and Lily find love with one another, or will they be torn apart once again?<br />This book was almost bipolar in nature.  There was Lily, who was considered to be superhumanly kind and compassionate, almost to the point where she was a doormat, allowing everyone to walk on her.  Even though people would say things to rile her, she'd just let it go and take it, instead of saying anything about it.  The few times she actually stood up to someone bullying her, she felt guilty about it later.  She was very weak-willed for most of the book.  Then, suddenly, there was this transformation in her towards the end of the book, and she became a vengeful shrew-like person.  It was like watching her dramatically change into someone completely new, and it was kind of weird.<br />Most of the book was spent trying to convince and cajole Max into becoming a Christian again, which got really repetitive and annoying after a while.  I felt really sorry for him, trying to be guilted into becoming a Christian again.  The author also had the tendency to introduce something into the plot, and then forget about it.  For example, Max's son Nate had a prominent role in the first half of the book, but was barely even mentioned in the second half of the book.  It was almost like Nate didn't exist.  Another example is the guilt Max supposedly felt for his wife's suicide, and yet it was barely mentioned at all.  <br/>There was a glaring error in the book when Lily donated blood to Nate.  Nate's blood was AB-, and Lily's blood was o+.  Granted, I'm not a nurse yet, but I know that people who have negative blood cannot receive donations from someone with positive blood.  Maybe most people wouldn't give that error a second glance, but honestly, if someone was given the wrong type of blood, the results could be disastrous.  Also, Max also admitted in the book that he was in love with Lily when he used to live in Amarillo.  The idea of an 18-year-old man being in love with a 12-year-old child made me VERY uncomfortable.  <br />All of these pale in comparison to a lovely sentence found on page 212.  The author said, in so many words, that if someone didn't trust Jesus, he or she can't be trusted as a person.  I don't know what kind of fantasy world this book was supposed to be set in, but I know that this statement is patently false.  The person I trust most in this world is an atheist, and I would trust him with my life and the life of my daughter.  Just because someone is not of a particular religion does not make them untrustworthy, and to assume so is just plain wrong.  This elitist and false comment got under my skin, big time.  I could give no more than two stars for this book, and that was a stretch, to say the least.	2004-06-22

While staking out a club in search for the killer, Diana sees club owner Ryder Latimer, an enigmatic man with whom she instantly shares chemistry.  Diana's not looking for a relationship though - not only is Ryder initially considered to be a suspect in the murders, but Diana refuses to get too close to any man.  After losing her father in a drive-by shooting as a teen, Diana knows the pain of losing someone you love more than life, and she reasons that if she stays away from emotional attachments, she'll avoid the pain that inevitably comes with them.<br />Ryder Latimer had seen her in his dreams, and there she was right before him.  She is forbidden, though - she is a living, breathing woman, and he is a vampire.  After being attacked by a roving band of vampires during the Civil War, Ryder has been one of them, and he knows that involving himself with a mortal woman could unleash his darkest impulses.  Still, Diana is too desirable to dismiss from his thoughts, but if she learns the truth about him, will she hate him?<br />This book was pretty good, and unusual because of the vampire element.  The tension between the two main characters was incredible, as they both fought against their desire for the other.  I also enjoyed the fact that the heroine was a latina like myself.  The only thing I didn't get with the book was the ending, it seemed a bit too abrupt and left me wondering exactly what had happened.  I can't describe it in detail or I'd give away the ending, but I was left a bit confused.<br />I would like to see another story that includes Diana and Ryder as secondary characters someday in the future.  Perhaps some of the secondary characters in this book could have their own story.  Altogether, this book was definitely interesting and unique, and I look forward to reading more stories from this author.	2004-06-21

Now she was 21 years old with a college degree and had a promising job lined up in New York City.  For the summer, she was staying at her father's ranch, where she couldn't help but run into Beau again.  They agreed to have a summer fling, and after Labor Day Starr would go to New York City and Beau would remain as foreman on a local ranch.  Starr gets pregnant immediately, though, and thus the problems begin.  She can't find the courage to tell him, especially since she knows that he's so dead-set against being a father and a husband, scared that he'll be like his own father.<br />Beau Tisdale was the only Tisdale to amount to something.  His father had been a drunk, one of Beau's older brother had died in prison, and Beau's other brother sat on death row for killing a police officer.  Beau himself had been involved in a cattle rustling scheme because of his brothers' influence, but he had served his time at the state's honor farm and had made a decent life for himself.  He had always loved Starr, but he knew deep in his heart that he wasn't good enough for her.  She deserved to chase her dreams, and he would only tie her down.  Still, he could definitely handle a summer fling, even though he knew it would probably break his heart again.  Will he admit to loving her, or will he let her leave his life once more?<br />I really liked this book, especially since there was so much more depth to the story than I expected there to be.  Beau was physically and emotionally scarred from being abused as a child.  His pain was so real, you could almost feel it as you read the story.  Starr was also nursing the hurt that she had suffered from Beau's hand, in his efforts to protect her from himself.  This book was really an emotional roller coaster, and the reader was privileged to personally feel it all, from the heights of dizzying love to the depths of a broken heart.  Tears came to my eyes a few times, as I watched Starr and Beau try to make sense of their attraction in light of their pasts and their vastly different futures.  The love scenes between Starr and Beau were so incredibly hot and sensual.  I could barely force myself to put down this book until I had read all of it!  This book was an incredible read, and I look forward to reading more from this author.	2004-06-21

Leslie Hopkins was a gifted photojournalist who had made one mistake - getting engaged to the wrong man.  Now that man, Ed Strickland, was stalking her, breaking into her apartment, and making Leslie fear for her life.  Leslie's sister, Diana Farrow, gives Leslie her ID and Leslie assumes Diana's identity, ending up in Salt Lake City, far from New York City and Ed.  The separation from her sister, niece, nephew, and brother-in-law is difficult for Leslie, but when she spies an ad in the paper offering a position as a live-in nanny, Leslie thinks it may be just the job for her.  Isolated away in the Grand Teton Mountains, surely Ed would never be able to find her there, and maybe she could actually step out into a public place without looking over her shoulder all of the time.<br />Chief Ranger Pierce Gallagher is desperately searching for a nanny for his young son, Cory.  If he can't find one that Cory likes, he and his son will be moving away from Grand Teton National Park, and Pierce will have to give up his job, although Pierce is more concerned with his son's happiness than his job.  When Pierce sees Leslie, he's awestruck - and a bit suspicious.  Leslie is all that he has been searching for in a nanny, and she seems a bit too good to be true.  He knows she's hiding something, but he can't figure out what it is.  As Pierce and Cory begin to form an attachment to Leslie, Leslie knows she has to share her secret with Pierce soon - or the results could be disastrous.<br />This book really caught me from the first page.  The reader is immediately thrown into the terror that haunts Leslie's life, as Leslie discovers that her ex-fiance has once again broken into her apartment, despite the fact that she has repeatedly changed the locks.  Leslie is courageous in spite of her fear, and she's a wonderful heroine.  She's hunted, and she knows that, but it doesn't stop her from reaching out to a motherless child and helping the child and his father address their own issues.Pierce was wonderful, as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading about him and Cory.<br />Ms. Winters has a remarkable ability to make you feel like you are actually part of the story.  I could almost smell and taste Leslie's fear and courage at the same time.  The last twenty pages of the book were a bit too hokey for my tastes, and way too predictable as well, but the rest of the story was so incredible I had to give the book five stars.  Reading this story is definitely a good way to spend a few hours.	2004-06-21

She was sure that no man would ever want her as his wife, she had surely heard that enough from her late husband.  The dream of having her own little family, complete with a brood of children, would just be a dream, and nothing more.  But when Rafe McCade shows up on her front doorstep with his injured daughter, asking Mary to heal his little girl, Mary can't help but feel a tug at her heartstrings.  She loves the child, but can she love the man, too?<br />Rafe McCade and his daughter were nearly killed in an attack.  His daughter injured, his first thought is to get her medical help, but the only doctor nearby was completely soused.  The shopkeeper recommended Rafe take his child to the Merry Widows, which Rafe mistakes as a brothel.  Once he lays eyes on Mary, he feels a stirring in his heart he hadn't felt for a very long time.  Rafe has to concentrate on getting his daughter well - and to discover who is trying to kill him, and why.<br />I liked the premise of this book, and the reviews were good.  It sounded like something I would like.  Unfortunately, I never got involved in the story at all.  The writing style just seemed so boring to me.  I kept looking at my watch and the page numbers, and wondering when this book would end.  That was disappointing, because I really thought that I would like this book.  Mary was incredibly quiet and reserved, and even when she wasn't, I never really bonded with her as a character.  I liked Rafe's love for his daughter, but I never grew attached to him as a character, either.  Two stars for the ideas behind the story, but I can't give it any more than that.	2004-06-16
US	23595366	R1NXOG925LID0W	0373292759	831950614	In the King's Service (Warrior)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	He couldn't afford to fall in love with a traitor's daughter	Sir Blaidd Morgan was on a mission for his young monarch, to determine if Lord Throckton was plotting to overthrow the king of England.  As a ruse to explain his presence at Lord Throckton's castle, Blaidd pretends to be only interested in courting the lovely Lady Leila, Lord Throckton's eldest daughter.  Although Lady Leila is gorgeous, she doesn't infatuate him like Lady Rebecca, Throckton's youngest daughter.  Blaidd can't afford to get too close to her, though, for his mission of espionage may be compromised, but he can't get her off his mind.<br />Lady Rebecca Throckton was unconventional.  She could ride a horse better than most men, shoot arrows with the best archers, and was incredibly strong-willed and headstrong.  When she first met Blaidd, she was sure that he would be like the others who had tried to court her beautiful older sister, but she soon finds herself infatuated with him.  Becca walks with a limp since she had an accident as a child, and she believes that no man will ever want her for a wife.  When she learns of Blaidd's true motives for being at her home, will she believe him, or tell her father of Blaidd's plans?<br />I liked this book pretty well.  Becca wasn't one of the silly, helpless women that too often appear in historical romances; she was strong, independent, and fierce in her own way.  Blaidd was also strong and fierce in his own way, he seemed a lot more masculine than a lot of heroes I have read about, really.  He didn't sit around all day talking about his feelings (which I can't stand in romance books), but he was tender and gentle when appropriate.  <br />The ending didn't work for me, it was way too cliched and I saw it coming a mile away.  I just knew what would happen, and what do you know, everything happened exactly as I suspected.  Also, the fact that no man would ever marry Becca simply because she limped a little was a bit far-fetched.  Surely someone would have married her, even if for her dowry alone (not romantic, I know, but love matches were rather rare at the time).  It wasn't even a genetic thing - she just broke her leg as a child.  Much ado over little, in my opinion.  Still, the book was a good way to pass the time, and I'll probably read it again someday.	2004-06-15

Australian supermodel Charmaine has had enough with men in her life.  Although she portrays a sexy siren in advertising campaigns, in reality she's been celibate for a while and has no plans to change that fact.  So when she meets arrogant Prince Ali at a horse race, she flatly and rudely refuses to go out to dinner with him - ever.  Eleven months later, Charmaine is auctioning herself off for charity, when Prince Ali bids five million dollars for a dinner date with her.  While on the dinner date, the handsome Prince makes another proposition - he'll donate five hundred million dollars for a week's worth of Charmaine's time - in his house, in his life, and in his bed.  Charmaine, who lost her little sister to cancer and has been quite devoted to funding cancer research since then, decides the offer is too good to pass up and accepts.<br />Prince Ali had been fascinated with Charmaine ever since he saw her in a television commercial.  Even after she quickly turned him down for a dinner date, he's still intrigued by the curvy blonde beauty.  So intrigued that he's willing to donate half a billion dollars to her favorite charity for a week spent with her.  He's not just desiring one week with her though; the plan is to make her fall in love with him!  Charmaine is guarding a secret very close to her heart, and he knows that she has to release whatever has troubled her so in the past to have a future - with him by her side!<br />This book is different from the types I usually read, but I still enjoyed it.  Parts of Charmaine's story were so like my life, it was painful to read about it.  I could completely understand her resentment, her simmering anger, and her inability to form close attachments to the opposite sex, once her entire story came out in the last twenty or so pages of the book.   Ali, I liked a bit less.  He was very arrogant, annoyingly so at times, and too much of a know-it-all for my tastes.  He was okay, but I liked the character of Charmaine a lot better.  <br />What didn't work for me: The profuse physical descriptions of a certain part of Ali during the first love scene, which seemed a bit too hokey for me.  Ali and Charmaine thinking they were in love with one another after such a short period of time was a bit too over the top for me, too.  The fact that both of the characters were more angry with each other than anything put me off a bit, too.<br />Still, the book was pretty good, especially if you want something to read that's a bit more spicy than your usual fare.  Miranda Lee can write, and write well, there is no doubting that.  So if you're looking for a passionate, quick read, this may be the one for you.	2004-06-14

During the night, however, there was a terrible accident, and Sarah awoke in a hospital with a broken leg, a newborn son, and the hospital staff calling her Mrs. Halliday.  Sarah, penniless and unable to provide for her son or herself, wanted to set things right, but upon seeing the grief of Stephen's brother and mother, she just couldn't do it quite yet.  Things snowballed out of control, until she found herself in love with Stephen's older brother - and knowing there could be no future between them because of her lies.<br />Nicholas Halliday could hardly believe that the somber Claire Halliday was the same person his younger brother Stephen had described in his letters, but she was his brother's widow, and he would take care of her and her son.  The only problem was, he didn't expect to have feelings for his brother's wife!  He couldn't let his feelings get the best of him because he had a foundry to run, and he was still unsure of Claire's motives for marrying Stephen in the first place.  Was she just a gold digger, or had she truly loved his brother?  Either way, it was going to spell trouble for him if he couldn?t keep his feelings for her in check.<br />As usual, Ms. St. John has written another emotionally charged story.  The first Harlequin Historical I ever read was 'The Tenderfoot Bride' by Ms. St. John, and I've been hooked on her work ever since then.  In this story, the character of Sarah is wonderful - she's desperate to provide a safe place for her son, but torn with guilt at her deception.  One really has to wonder what they would do if put into a similar situation.  At first, I didn't care too much for Nicholas, because he was always suspicious of Claire/Sarah being a gold digger, so he was rude to her and didn't trust her, but he couldn't fight his feelings of attraction for her.  There were times when he let his hair down, though, and he was very tender and gentle, especially with Sarah's baby.  In the end, he redeemed himself in my eyes.  I won't tell you what happened at the end, but the last 50 pages or so were excellent!<br />Altogether, this is a lovely book.  Once I started reading it, I found it almost impossible to tear myself away from it.  Ms. St. John has a wonderful gift when it comes to writing and creating heart-warming characters, and I can't wait to read more of her books!	2004-06-14

Julianna Reynolds had left her small Oklahoma town behind ten years ago to pursue her dreams of being a model in Los Angeles.  Unfortunately, she also left behind her heart behind with Tate McIntyre, a wild boy who had captured her soul.  Five months after leaving Seminole County, Julianna discovered she was pregnant with Tate's baby - but Tate had already married another woman, and Julianna kept their baby to herself.  That is, until one day when her daughter needed a bone marrow transplant - and Julianna was sure Tate would match and donate the bone marrow needed to save his secret little girl's life!    When Tate saw Julianna in his hometown again, he was floored.  She was as gorgeous as ever, but Tate was completely changed.  He was no longer the bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks, but the county's beloved sheriff.  He's loved Julianna forever, but when she left him, his whole world collapsed and he made some huge mistakes.  He's determined not to let her destroy him again, for surely she'll leave after the charity bone marrow donation she was organizing was through.  But once Julianna learns that Tate is not a match for her child - she knows the only way to save her child is to tell Tate about his daughter, and ask him to help her create another baby!    I loved this book.  Ms. Goodnight wrote so much emotion into the pages, you could almost feel it as soon as you picked up the book.  Julianna was a totally wonderful heroine, full of grit and determination to save her daughter, and still harboring the love she had always felt for Tate.  Tate was an exceptional hero, as well - he still carried a torch for Julianna, and as soon as he learned he had a daughter, he wanted to make up for lost time and be as involved with her as he could possibly be.  The romance story of Julianna and Tate, combined with the heartbreaking ordeal of their young daughter as she struggles for her life, creates a story that you won't soon forget.  Be prepared with tissues when youread this book - I cried profusely in a few different parts, and I'm not usually the type to shed many tears over books.  This book is five stars all the way!	2004-06-13

She didn't have time for any type of serious relationship, despite the advances and the offers she has received.  She is content to spend her life caring for Davina (Davy), her spirited daughter - or at least, that is what Sarah tells herself.  But when she darts out in front of a car in a thunderstorm, she meets the most intriguing man - and she suddenly wonders how she can let this wonderfully intriguing man walk out of her life.  If he stays in her life, though, she will be forced to divulge a secret that could destroy her daughter and the life Sarah has eked out for the both of them.<br />Jake Hogan had dreamed of running into the woman of his dreams - although he never meant literally!  But when the business tycoon accidentally hits Sarah Tracy in the middle of a thunderstorm, he is transfixed by her beauty and charm.  He is determined to get to know this woman better, but she seems so withdrawn and standoffish most of the time.  He can tell there is something in her past that is preventing her from getting too involved with him, but he won't let that stop him, for one way or another, Stacy and Davina are meant to be a part of his family for keeps!<br />I enjoyed this book as something different from what I usually read.  Although the book is clearly set in England, the lingo was usually toned to a minimum and even I, an English-is-my-second-language reader, didn't have too much difficulty deciphering what the author meant by using British lingo.  I liked the character of Sarah, and could identify with her as a single mother myself.  Sarah had a difficult time because she was always looking for a potential step-father to Davy, as well as a mate, all rolled into one package.  I could definitely relate to that.  I also liked the character of Jake Hogan because he wanted to include Sarah's child in their relationship too, instead of just shutting Davy out.  <br />As for Sarah's secret, it was not what I expected it to be at first.  After being told halfway through the book what the secret was not, it didn't take too much to figure out what it was.  The secret itself was a bit of a let-down, and although there was much tension leading up the revealing of the secret, the secret itself was rather anticlimactic.  Once the secret was revealed, the rest of the book had a few subplots shoved into it to spice up the story, but those subplots were rather rushed and one was just solved way too easily.  Altogether, though, this wasn't a bad book, and was actually quite enjoyable for the most part.  The book earned a solid four star rating from me.  This book was reissued by Harlequin Presents in June 2004.  The cover is different, but the text is the same.	2004-06-13

Not only did the head of the MacCarthy clan desire Lady Moira's keep, but he also desired Lady Moira's child, which he believed to be his slain brother's child.  Desperate to save her people and her unborn child, Lady Moira turns to her overlord for help, who sends his brother, Sir Connor FitzClifford, to protect her.  Lady Moira is leery to trust any man, but she knows for the sake of her people and her child, she must learn to trust Sir Connor.<br />Once condemned as a coward by his kin, Sir Connor has perfected his physique and his mind to take advantage of any mistakes made by the enemy he can find.  He will not be made to feel weak and defenseless again.  One look at the beautiful and intelligent Lady Moira, though, and he can't help but feel the defenses around his heart to begin to crack.  Perhaps she can help him heal the wounds of his childhood, and perhaps he can show her how freeing love can be!<br />I really liked this book.  It was easy to read, the pace was always quick enough to keep it interesting but slow enough so I didn't get lost, and the characters were so easy to grow to adore.  Lady Moira was a great heroine - strong, independent, and yet craving the love she had never had from any man in her life.  Connor was excellent because he was a strong and brave warrior, yet gentle and patient when it came to Moira.  He readily would have lay his life down for her, and to see their love developing and blossoming under such tense circumstances was lovely.  I know I'll be reading this again.<br />I do wish that more information had been given on both Lady Moira's and Sir Connor's backgrounds.  There was a bit more information on Moira, because her brothers made appearances in the story, but Connor's past was relatively hazy.  It was clear early on that he was physically and emotionally abused as a child by his domineeringfather, but beyond that, there was little information about him.  The smooth, flowing writing style of Ms. Schulze and the wonderfully warm characters she created, however, made up for that lack of information in my opinion.  I am looking forward to reading more of Ms. Schulze's work!	2004-06-13

Melanie Stafford was the half-owner of Classic Cars, a professional restoration business.  It wasn't her dream, or even what she wanted to do, but it paid the bills and gave her some freedom.  She was content enough to manage the restoration business and pay half of the shop's earnings to her partner, Jackson, whose only interest in the business was the small paycheck he received every month for being the other half-owner.  Jackson always said he was going to sell his half of the business, but Melanie never believed he'd really do it - until Wyatt Reynolds walked in to the shop one day, saying he was her new boss!<br />Wyatt Reynolds really had no idea about restoring classic cars - or why the red-haired manager of the shop seemed so put off when he identified himself as the new boss.  He soon realized that he wasn't her boss, but her partner.  She was interesting, and intelligent, but he wasn't looking for anything serious.  All he wanted to do was sell his half of the business and make a tidy profit before moving on.  So why was he so taken with his new partner, and why did he want to spend all the time he could with her?<br />This book was a nice little romantic story, something sweet but nothing too memorable.  Both of the characters were a bit flat and were never really fleshed out.  The reader grew to know Melanie more than Wyatt.  Wyatt was a rather reclusive fellow who didn't seem to volunteer much personal information, and at the end of the book, I felt like I knew next to nothing about him.  Melanie was a bit more forth-coming about her personal life, but only in fits and spurts, and I didn't know her that well, either.  There was a lot of car-talk in the book, which I hate to say really went over my head.  Still, the book was a nice, pleasant read, good for beach reading.  If you're looking for something that pulls at the heartstrings or delves into more emotional waters, you may want to skip this one, though.	2004-06-09

Eleanor Scarborough Miller had been a schoolteacher in Charlotte, North Carolina, when a young man from the Carolina hills had wooed her at the most vulnerable time in her life.  She married him and went with him to his mountain home, only to discover that he had married her because he thought that she had money.  Now, widowed and alone, Eleanor lives atop a hill that is rumored to hold more gold.  She's a prisoner in her own home, kept there by her greedy in-laws who won't let her leave.  Her in-laws are scared that if Eleanor leaves, gold-hungry hordes would flock to their backwoods area; and Eleanor is scared that if she doesn't leave, her in-laws will eventually kill her to keep the gold they think is there. Her in-laws' brutality is confirmed when Eleanor finds a man nearly beaten to death, stumbling up the mountain toward her home, nearly killed by her in-laws because he had innocently trespassed upon their land.<br />Jed Blackstone was a happy-go-lucky sort who managed to eke out a living by playing cards.  In his free time, he chased women and liked to read encyclopedias in the libraries.  His no-responsibilities lifestyle abruptly came to an end when he received word that his half-brother was going to lose his farm if Jed didn't have the money to help him.  Fortunately for Jed and his brother, Jed had acquired a valuable piece of land in a poker game.  While heading toward his hometown, though, Jed stepped onto the wrong piece of land - and was nearly killed for it.  Eleanor takes him in and begins to nurse him back to health, but Jed can't wait to leave, desperate to get back to his family before they lose their farm.  When it comes time for him to leave though, will he be able to leave Eleanor behind?<br />This story was different from most I have read, I noticed that right away.  The hero and heroine were a bit unconventional.  Eleanor was older, more educated, and more mature than Jed.  Jed was not rich, did not possess superhuman strength, and seemed to have more issues than Eleanor.  It was refreshing to break free from the typical hero and heroine, no matter how small the break actually was.  <br />Unfortunately, the book tended to drag for the first 200 pages, and after that the plot moved too fast.  Much of the book was spent with Eleanor chattering on about escaping, with Jed lying in a bed while his cracked ribs healed.  Eleanor was a bit too annoying for my tastes, but still a fairly good character.  After the first 200 pages, though, everything seemed to happen.  The author had a lot of plot holes to close up in a short amount of time, and she accomplished this task, but left me feeling too rushed.  Some of the subplots, and characters, added on at the end of the book really could have been left out without any damage to the story itself.  <br />Altogether, though, the story is a good one.  If you like a romance story that is a little different, this may be the one for you to read.   I'm looking forward to reading more from this author in the future.	2004-06-09

Patsy Prichard is a nurse at an Air Force base, where she sees more than her share of attractive, single men who would love to take her out on a date.  'Prickly Prichard,' however, will have none of it.  She's determined to keep herself cool, calm, and detached as can be - even if Sergeant Ray Darling makes her heart skip a beat or two.  A painful secret in Patsy's past urges her to keep Ray out of her life.  Patsy's eccentric Great-Aunt Myrtle, however, isn't content to let Patsy keep to herself, and 'buys' Ray at a bachelor auction for her niece Patsy!<br />Raymond Darling was sure he wouldn't fetch a good price at the bachelor auction, but it was for charity and he'd be glad to do his part.  He's shocked when he learns that the older woman who 'bought' him for a date is 'Prickly Prichard's' great-aunt, and Aunt Myrtle is determined to set up the two of them!  Not that it would be so bad, in Ray's mind - Patsy was a beautiful, caring woman, and if he could get her to open up to him, he was sure she could be a warm person.  Ray, however, is plagued with his own difficulties in the past.  Can these two battered hearts find a home in one another?<br />This book was a solid military romance, and fans of Bonnie Gardner will note that there are several cameos of past characters in her other books.  For example, Rich Larsen and his bride from 'Uncle Sarge' both make a short appearance in this book.  The story itself was pretty good - there was good dialogue between the two characters, and enough issues to work through to keep the story going.  I did notice, however, that the two main characters seemed to act a bit juvenile toward one another, getting in petty arguments and acting in childish manners (especially Patsy, unfortunately).  I realize that neither Patsy or Ray had much experience with the opposite sex, but honestly, I thought most people outgrew such behavior by the time they hit high school.<br />Nevertheless, the story was a good one.  I am a fan of militaryromances, and this one was one of my keepers.  One of the things I love about Bonnie Gardner's books is the fact that her heroes are not macho men who cannot show their more tender sides.  Ms. Gardner paints her heroes as much more human than many other military romances do.  If you don't mind characters who have a bit of growing up to do, then this book is definitely worth reading.  Altogether, this book earned a solid four stars in my opinion, and I'm looking forward to reading more from Ms. Gardner.	2004-06-08

Dr. Rachel Maguire left her hometown of Sonora twelve years ago to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor.  She left part of her heart in Sonora with her high school love, Josh, but Rachel, fueled by the memory of her biological mother's tragic and needless death, was certain that God's will for her life was to become a doctor and help save lives.  Rachel found herself returning to Sonora, though, when her adopted mother, Mom G, was diagnosed with a terminal tumor.  Rachel hopes beyond hope that she can save Mom G, but her efforts fail, and she realizes just how alone she is in the world.  <br />Josh Taylor dreads seeing Rachel again, but he tolerates Rachel's presence for the sake of his friend, Mom G.  He makes a death bed promise to Mom G to take care of Rachel, but he doesn't know how well he'll be able to fulfill that promise.  Rachel lives across the country in Chicago, and Josh's home is in Sonora with his eight-year-old son, Griff.  As Rachel cares for Mom G's estate, though, Josh notices that Griff becomes enamored with Rachel - and although he doesn't want to admit it, Josh also realizes that he never stopped loving Rachel.  Rachel's life is elsewhere, though, and Josh is determined to keep his heart from breaking again - is there any hope for them to become a family?<br />I gave this book three stars for the character of Rachel and the writing ability of the author.  I loved Rachel - she was emotionally wounded, but she managed to triumph and work to improve others' lives.  Some people would allow the horrible tragedy of losing their mother at a young age to completely overwhelm them, but Rachel persevered and made sure her mother's life wasn't lost in vain.  The author, new to the Steeple Hill line, is also talented.  I'd like to read more from her.<br />That said, I could not stand the character of Josh at all!  That's why I only rated this book with three stars.  If the hero had been rational and/or kind, the book would have easily earned four stars.  Instead, Josh was usually quite cruel and bitter toward Rachel, I could count the number of times he actually had a nice thing to say to Rachel on one hand.  You'd think that someone could show some kindness to a woman who had just lost her adoptive mother, but that just wasn't the case for Josh.  Josh always prattled on about how Rachel had hurt him when he left, but he never took the time to consider how it must have hurt her to be put into a position where she had to choose between a career in medicine and marriage, or how much it had hurt her to learn that he had married someone else a mere six months after she left for college!  <br />Instead, Rachel seemed to think that she deserved to be blamed for everything, and be the only one apologizing for atrocious behavior.  Josh completely left me cold.  If he had truly loved Rachel, he could have waited for her to finish college, or even moved to be closer to her, but those were never options in his mind.  He made her choose between an education and marriage, which was completely wrong of him to do.  He also presumed to know what God's will for Rachel's life was, and he wasn't afraid to tell her that he knew what God's plan was for her, either.  He was so arrogant and insensitive, I had to wonder how Rachel could ever fall in love with him!  She must like to be treated badly.  The last 50 or so pages of the book were the worst.  I just wanted to toss the book and say, 'Ick,' but I managed to stick it out and finish it.  I definitely won't be reading this one again.<br />If you like romance books where the hero is a jerk most of the time and the heroine accepts being treated badly, this is the book for you.  If you don't like books like that, you will probably want to skip this one.  You may also want to skip this book if you don't like overtly religious books.  Unlike most of the Steeple Hill books I have read, this one is less of a 'general clean-read romance' and more of a 'religious romance, with frequent mentionsof Jesus and the Christian faith.'   The book had promise, but I was really disappointed with it.  Hopefully the author's next book (if she writes one) will be better.	2004-06-05

Josey St. John and Nate Bennington had become fast friends after he crashed into her apartment wielding a baseball bat.   He had thought she was being attacked and was ready to rescue her, but in reality, she had just been getting into the football game a bit too much.  Ever since that day, however, they had been practically inseparable.  One day, though, Josey's biological clock began to tick, and she was determined to find a husband and to settle down to raise a family.  She's sure that Nate is the perfect man to screen her dates to make sure that they're marriage material, but as she commences on her quest, Josey begins to think that maybe Nate is the perfect man for her!<br />Nate is a quiet, serious lawyer hiding from the pain of an abusive childhood.  He's managed to make something of himself despite all of the obstacles in his life, but he believes that he's unable to be a loving father and husband, sure that his father's abusive tendencies are lurking somewhere beneath the surface.  So when Josey wants him to help her find Mr. Right, he can't understand why he's so jealous of Josey's dates - surely he can't be falling for her?<br />When I bought this book, I thought it was going to be a cute little story about two best friends falling in love with one another.   Before I read three pages, though, I knew that it was going to be much more than that.  Even though the author states pretty early that Nate had been abused as a child, I knew that as soon as he began to think his neighbor was being attacked.  I knew because I overreact the same way, and I've had a similar childhood as Nate.  Once I knew for sure that my suspicions had been correct, I knew that this book was going to be unlike anything I`ve read before.<br />Don't get me wrong, there is a sweet love story in this book.  The conversation between the two characters was amazingly smooth and realistic, almost as if the reader is actually peering into the life of two real people.  There are plenty of funny moments, misunderstandings, and romantic tension between the two main characters, too.  The story itself, without the element of child abuse added into it, would definitely rate at least a four in my opinion.<br />The real gem of this book, however, is the fact that it does deal with the touchy and painful subject of child abuse.  This book really shows the effects of child abuse on adults - happy, normal, and successful people on the outside, who are still too often burdened with the guilt, shame, and hurt from their pasts.  Through the character of Nate, we see the importance of letting go the past as much as we can so we can have a future, perhaps a future that even includes a family.  <br />Overall, this book was absolutely wonderful.  I rarely cry when reading books, but this one had me pulling out the tissues.  Once I finished the book, I had a deep sense of peace and satisfaction, definitely time well-spent.  The author managed to combine a sweet romantic story with a serious issue, which was just phenomenal.  I am looking forward to reading more from this author, and am hoping that perhaps she'll write a book about Derek (Nate's older brother).  This book is an excellent read and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good love story.	2004-05-21

Alexandra Lexington had come back to her hometown of Laurel Glen fleeing from her abusive husband with barely enough money for a meal.  The only person willing to take her in was Elizabeth Boyer, the woman her brother had raped years before.  When Beth took Xandra in, Xandra's life changed forever.  She was slowly able to rebuild her broken life, thanks to the helpful people at her church and a lot of prayer.  Now divorced, Xandra worked as a high school guidance counsellor.  When she meets Beth's nephew, Mark, she is determined to help him form a close relationship with his father, Adam.<br />Adam Boyer is immediately distrustful of Xandra because she was the sister of the man who had terrorized his sister.  He soon begins to realize, however, that Xandra may be the only person who could help his teenaged son become close to him.  Adam had quit the Navy SEALs to become the full-time father Mark needed after his mother's death, but Mark seemed to despise him.  Before he knows it, Adam begins to develop feelings for the mysterious Xandra, despite the fact that she seems to be distrustful of him.  Can they form a relationship despite their troubled pasts?<br />If I could give this book 4.5 stars, I would.  Xandra and Adam were both believable characters who seemed like regular people caught in a mire of emotions that many people have to address sometime in their lives.  The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was the tendency to either overdevelop sub-plots at the expense of the romance, or to introduce subplots without developing them much.   Other than that, this book was just about as good as you can get for this genre.  There was enough spiritual talk to mark it as a Christian book, but not enough to make the less spiritually-inclined too uncomfortable.  <br />The best part of this book, in my opinion, was the fact that the author dealt with the sticky situation of divorce.  Adam was divorced but his ex-wife had died, but Xandra's abusive ex-husband was still living.  I really liked how the fictional pastor was so loving and not judgmental about Xandra being divorced.  Having grown up in a church were divorce was akin to apostasy, I was really glad to see such a loving response to Xandra's obvious emotional and spiritual distress over her divorce.  The letter to the readers at the end of the book from the author is also wonderfully supportive.  That was so refreshing to me.<br />Altogether, I highly recommend this book for anyone, whether you are Christian or not, who enjoys a clean read that actually deals with real-life struggles.  This book was not \\"fluffy\\" like so many romance novels tend to be - and I liked that.  I'm looking forward to reading more from this author, and I'm also looking forward to reading books she has already written about the other residents of Laurel Glen (particularly the story of Elizabeth Boyer and Jack Alton).	2004-05-14

Rachel Peters was an up-and-coming chef who was about to open her own restaurant in New York City when she heard of her Aunt Flora's death.  She hurries back to her hometown of Magnolia Blossom to take care of her younger sister and brother, planning to move her siblings to New York with her once she gets the okay from her parents, who were busy researching things in the jungle and never had time for their three children.  Her plans quickly fall to pieces, though, when she discovers that her younger sister absolutely refuses to leave Magnolia Blossom, and her younger brother barely knows Rachel.  Worse yet, Rachel ran into her high school sweetheart, Michael Hunter, and the confusing feelings that she still feels for him don't help the situation, either.<br />Michael Hunter had moved on with his life.  He had married, had a son, and divorced since he saw Rachel last, but that didn't mean that he had forgotten about her.  He was bitter towards her, though, because she had left Magnolia Blossom and him far behind her ten years ago.  He didn't want to be around her any more than he had to, but his son was friends with her younger brother, and Rachel desperately needed his help to win her siblings' loyalty.  As he spent time with Rachel, though, he couldn't help but feel the love he once had for her.  Can that love grow again?<br />This book was pretty good, with fairly realistic characters and situations.  I could completely understand why Rachel had fled Magnolia Blossom ten years ago, but what I couldn't understand is why Michael was so mean to her.  He was almost downright cruel to her a few times, and he didn't lessen up even though she was grieving her aunt's death and was stressed about her siblings, although at other times he was disarmingly nice to her.   I know that she had hurt him when she left, but there's really no excuse for that kind of behavior.  I felt really sorry for Rachel because not only was Michael treating her shabbily, but so was her sister Amy.  Other than that, I enjoyed the book, especially the character of Rachel.  I really identified with her, and the author did a great job of explaining her reasoning for wanting to roam the world instead of staying in Magnolia Blossom.  I would love to read more from this author.	2004-05-14

Grace Stanton was in a serious car accident after another car drifted into her lane.  Rather than put the family in the other car in danger, she swerved to miss them, running into a concrete wall.  The good news was, the other family was fine and thankful that Grace hadn't hit them.  The bad news was, Grace was scarred, bruised, suffering from internal injuries, and had severed a tendon in her hand.  To beat all, her shallow fiance Patrick couldn't deal with the fact that Grace had been so horribly injured and, although he didn't come outright and say it right away, he wouldn't marry her.  Her body and faith damaged, Grace retreats to her aunt Ruth's small town to nurse her internal and external wounds.<br />Noah Brady was an excellent plastic surgeon who may have been able to make more money elsewhere, he prefered the small town of Rosewood, Texas.  As soon as he sees Grace, his determination to keep only professional relationships with his patients wavers a bit.  He wants to help Grace heal, not only physically, but also spiritually.  He begins to befriend Grace, purposely putting her in situations and circumstances that require her to come out of her shell and begin to live again.  As he becomes more involved in Grace's life, however, he can't help but realize that he wants to be much more than friends with Grace, he wants to marry her!<br />I really liked this book because it did a very good job of detailing the healing process that anyone goes through after a severe trauma, whether that trauma is physical or emotional.  Grace's feelings, which ranged from deep depression to anger, were so clearly portrayed that I could almost feel them myself.  Noah was a perfect hero - strong, capable, determined, and always wanting the best for Grace.  Grace was also a great heroine because she seemed so real.  She didn't assume a pious attitude and try to cover up her true feelings with religiousity - her faith was shaken, and she was willing to admit that and work through that.  The author did a wonderful job with this book, and I'm looking forward to reading more from her.	2004-05-12

Kay Lovell was normally a strictly law-abiding citizen, but the tempting blackberries in a neighbor's neglected garden called to her.  She took some of the berries and, feeling a bit guilty, came back the next day to replace the broken lock on the garden gate.  While in the garden, a thin, haunted-looking Dominic Ravenscar spied her from a window in his house.  Believing that Kay is really his dead wife, Sara, Dominic enters the garden and kisses Kay.  Kay is shocked by the kiss; not only is she shocked that a stranger is kissing her, but she's more shocked that she is responding to the kiss - something she hasn't done in a long time.<br />Dominic Ravenscar is also shocked - shocked that he could have mistaken Kay Lovell for his beloved deceased wife.  Sara has been gone for six years, and for six years Dominic has lived in a shadowy world, never pausing to fully grieve the loss of his wife.  He believed that if he kept running, the pain wouldn't catch up with him.  Six years of running, however, hadn't done him much good, and so he returned to his old home to sell it.  He wants Kay's help in selling his home, but can Kay help him more than he imagines and heal his broken heart?<br />At first, I was really into this book.  There was a mystery surrounding Kay and her daughter, Polly, which I thought could be quite interesting.  I also loved the premise of the story with a dark, brooding hero.  It almost reminded me of a gothic novel, and I like those once in a while.  The more I read, though, the more boring the story became.  The first half of the book was pretty good - Kay is determined to help Dominic overcome the ghosts of his past while she keeps her own secrets to herself - but after the 100 page mark, things went downhill fast.  Kay became a rather weak heroine as time wore on, and Dominic went from miserable one day to completely healed over night.  The timeline was pretty unrealistic after the first 100 pages, as well.  There was a huge development in the story that was pretty much glossed over with just a few pages devoted to it, and a huge potential hindrance to the relationship went away without much discussion at all.  The book was okay, but I won't be reading it again.	2004-05-11

Lady Gastonia Cavendish had only wanted to start her own nunnery far away from the secular world, but her devotion to the Catholic religion was a dangerous thing in Protestant-ruled England.  Tried and convicted of heresy because of her religion, she was sentenced to death and banished to the crumbling castle of Hawksnest until her executioner arrived to carry out her death sentence.  <br />Sandor Matskella is the unlucky man who has been chosen to be Gastonia's executioner.  A Gypsy, his people are despised in England.  He was an unwilling executioner; his young cousin was held in the Tower of London until the dastardly deed was done, and Sandor's uncle was too ill to perform the execution himself.  Once he lays eyes upon the beautiful and charming Gastonia, however, Sandor isn't sure how he could possibly execute such a wonderful woman.  Will he follow the King's orders, or his own heart?<br />I decided to read this book after reading 'Beloved Enemy' by Mary Schaller (Mary Schaller and Tori Phillips are the same person, Tori Phillips is Ms. Schaller's pen name).  'Beloved Enemy' had been such a good book, and I was hoping that Ms. Schaller's other books were just as great.  I was not disappointed!  I loved the story of Gastonia and Sandor, especially the wonderful bits of information interwoven with the story about Gypsy culture and customs.  The emotions and conflicts experienced in this book are powerful.  <br />The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was because Sandor and Gastonia seemed a bit juvenile.  One of them would say something, and the other would just jump to a conclusion and lash out at the other.  It was kind of sad to watch!  Other than that, I think the book is excellent.  I am definitely looking forward to reading the rest of the Cavendish Chronicles, and am very excited about reading more from this author!	2004-05-06

Daniel and Luke McLain decided that one of them just had to marry - they were fed up with cooking for themselves, their house was filthy, and if something happened to both of them they had no heirs to whom they could leave their ranch.  The only problem was, neither of them wanted to be married!  To decide who had to pick a wife, the brothers drew straws - and Luke McLain drew the short straw.<br />Luke McLain didn't demand too much in a wife.  He just wanted someone who was somewhat pretty, had a calm demeanor, wasn't afraid of hard work, would do what he said, and could give him the sons he wanted.  The tall, rugged cowboy thought that it couldn't be TOO hard to find a woman with those qualities.  Nevermind that the preacher in town told him that you couldn't look for a wife the way one would look for a horse - Luke thought he didn't need a love match, even though his parents had had one.  So when he met shy, sweet Eleanor Williams, he thought he had found the perfect candidate for the new Mrs. Luke McLain.<br />Eleanor was fast reaching the age of spinsterhood, as her cruel younger cousin reminded her.  Eleanor secretly dreamed of a love match, but she knew that she had to be practical about marriage.  Practical, however, was the last thing on her mind when she caught sight of the handsome McLains, especially Luke.  She was certain that he would never show any interest in her, though...until he proposed a marriage of convenience!  There was still something missing, though - and Eleanor wouldn't give up until she had her husband's love.<br />I liked this book rather well.  It was a very fast read, particularly because my copy of the book had very large margins and a lot of space between the lines of the text.  Eleanor was an interesting character, as was Luke, but quite frankly, I was more interested in watching Daniel (Luke's brother) and Letty (Eleanor's best friend, a young widow) spar with one another.  The story's premise was very promising, but it just fella bit flat for me.  There didn't seem to be much depth to the story.  There was some good parts in the book that made me laugh out loud.  It just seemed to me that the storyline could have been developed so much more, and the characters could have been fleshed out better.  There was a lot of potential material with which to work, but the story seemed fairly superficial to me.  Still, it was a fairly good read, and if you are looking for some light reading with a bit of humor stashed away in it, this is a good book for you to consider reading.	2004-05-03

Julia Chandler was a sheltered bookworm who never rocked the boat like her feisty younger sister, Carolyn. Julia was mostly content to bury herself in books and lose herself in dreams of becoming a teacher and what might have been had the Civil War not happened. With her sweetheart, Frank, killed at Manassas two years ago, Julia's scheming mother has decided that Julia will marry her cousin Payton. Although Julia's mother is fond of Payton, Julia thinks Payton is a toad and is only after her inheritance. Determined to refuse marriage to Payton, Julia and her sister sneak uninvited into a masquerade ball where Julia wants to find a Yankee to ruin her - although she doesn't exactly know what that means.      Robert Montgomery is a bitter major in the United States Army. After being shot in the hand at Gettysburg, his fickle fianc?e broke their engagement because he had lost the use of the wounded hand. Now he trusts no woman, but he can't help but be entranced by the lovely Julia. He can't help but be drawn to her, especially after the rather inebriated young woman asks him to have his dastardly way with her. Ever the gentleman, Rob declines, but he is determined to see her again - even after he learns she is loyal to the Confederacy. Can love triumph in the midst of war?      This book was excellent! If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Ms. Schaller obviously did her research on the Civil War, and perfectly blended real historical figures with the fictional characters in the book. I loved Julia because she was so determined and intelligent. I also loved the character of Rob because he was brave and devoted. There were some twists and turns in this book, so you were never really sure what would happen next! There was something for everyone in this book - romance, political turmoil, war, intrigue, misunderstandings, social scandal, espionage, and a host of other things that blended into an awesome story.      I didn't discover this until after I read the book, but Mary Schaller has also used the penname &quot;Tori Phillips&quot; and wrote several books for Harlequin set in the medieval era. So if you are a fan of Tori Phillips, you'll probably love this book too, even though it is set in a different time period. I love books set in the Civil War era, although Harlequin really doesn't seem to publish many of them. I wish they published more, especially if they were as well written as this one! This is easily one of the best romance novels I have ever read.	2004-05-02

So Piper needs to find a man - now!  The only problem is, all of the local guys don't treat her like one of the guys, instead of a desirable female.  She needs someone to show her what it takes to attract a man, and fast!<br />Gabe Rivers has been Piper's friend ever since she was a little girl.  Now she's all grown up, and he can't get over how attractive she is.  He's reluctant to show her how a woman can entice a man, but she's so determined, what can it hurt?  As he spends more and more time with her, Gabe feels like he won't be able to let her go...but he was severely injured in an automobile crash, a crash that ultimately ended his beloved military career, and his life is in too much disarray to possible offer Piper that he has anything to offer her...right?<br />I enjoyed this book, but I had a difficult time understanding some of it.  English is not my first language, and although I would like to think that I have mastered the language fairly well, all of the Australian lingo confused me.  I spent some time looking up the meaning of some of the words in the book, but on the bright side, I did learn some new words, such as ute, jillaroo, and bloke.  :)<br />The story line was pretty good.  I have a thing for military heroes in books, and Gabe was definitely one, and a good one at that.  I also liked Piper, she was quite head-strong and independent.  I would have given the book five stars, except the plot seemed to drag for the first third of the book, and then things sort of went into warp-speed in the last third of the book.  Altogether, though, I thought the book was very good, and I would recommend it.	2004-05-01

When Madeline Hale came back to her old hometown for a friend's wedding, she was a totally different girl from the chubby bookworm she had been 12 years ago.  She still had the brains, but now she was the chief chemist for a hot cosmetics company, and she definitely had a much-improved body to go along with her new image.  It doesn't take her very long to run into Austin Jericho, her old crush.  He's as gorgeous as ever, and Madeline can't help but want a little fling while she's back in town, just to prove to herself that she's in control...<br />Austin Jericho can't believe how much Maddie Hale has changed.  She's no longer the shy, innocent schoolgirl who brought him blueberry muffins and tutored him after school.  Now she's drop-dead gorgeous and sinfully sensuous, as well.  The only problem is, Austin has just decided to settle down with a sweet little wife, and although he hasn't met that sweet little wife yet, Maddie's definitely not fitting the bill.  Maybe a fling wouldn't be such a bad thing, but Austin wants more - not only does he want a sweet wife, but he also wants that prime piece of property he's been offered if he can find marriage material before Miss Marshalyn leaves for Florida.  Will he give in to his desire for Maddie, or will he push her away to find someone like she used to be?<br />This book was h-o-t!  It definitely lived up to the Blaze standards, and then some!  I could identify with Madeline, since once upon a time I was an ugly duckling.  I was glad that she was able to make something of her life and take control.  Austin was also incredible, and you could just feel the sparks when you picked up this book!  I can't wait to read the next book in the series, 'The Fantasy Factor,' by the same author.  The author of this book just draws you into the story so well, and uses humor as well as sizzling passion to make this a great read.  Definitely a keeper, but be forewarned - if you aren't already hooked on the Blaze line of books, you probably will be once you read this book!   :)	2004-04-21

Nolie Lang is determined to get a grant for her program for training service dogs.  In order to prove her program worthy, the charity potentially funding the grant has picked a candidate to prove Nolie's program works - injured firefighter Gabriel (Gabe) Flanagan.  As soon as Nolie meets Gabe, however, it's very obvious to her that she;s going to have a fight on her hands - Gabe doesn;t want to even acknowledge that he has a problem.  But Nolie's determined to fight - and win - for the sake of her program, whether Gabe likes it or not!<br />Gabe Flanagan could only groan when he realized that he was going to work with this plain Jane to improve a problem that he believes doesn't exist anymore.  As Gabe gets to know Nolie, though, he realizes that she's not a plain Jane at all - and the heart she has for animals and children is incredible.  Nolie continues to hold herself back from most adult interaction, preferring to spend most of her time alone on her farm for abandoned animals.  He's feeling things for Nolie, though, that he can't explain, and he know she's feeling the same way.  Can these two injured people be healed through love?<br />I loved the character of Nolie - although deeply wounded from her childhood, she still persevered and didn't let her bad experiences defeat her.  She's the perfect counterpart for Gabe, because he refuses to face the problems that threaten his beloved career, and Nolie has faced her demons and tried to move on as best as she can.  They both helped one another, and that is what I enjoyed the most about this book.  Although a Christian book, I think anyone who likes clean reading can enjoy this book.  I have always liked Marta Perry's books, and this book was as good as the rest!  Even better, this book is the first in the series 'The Flanagans,' so be watching for more books involving the Flanagan family!	2004-04-21

Katie Rogers made a horrible mistake when she left the small town of Dundee, Idaho two years ago. She thought that she would make a great life for herself in San Francisco, especially since she was leaving with a man she was sure she'd marry. The only problem was, she was leaving the man she truly cared about back in Dundee. Her parents and friends had convinced her that she would be making a huge mistake if she stayed with Booker Robinson, an ex-con and the town's outcast. Katie didn't realize that leaving with Andy was the mistake - until two years later, when she was forced to come back to Dundee, penniless and pregnant.<br />Booker Robinson can't believe that it's Katie, the last person he wantd to see, standing in the rain beside her broken-down car. He's spent the last two years trying to forget the woman who had rejected his marriage proposal and broken his heart. He offers to take her to her parents' house, but once her mother slams the door in her face, telling Katie she's made her bed so lie in it, Booker finds himself offering Katie a place to stay until she gets settled. He's determined to keep his distance from her, but how can he do that when he's never stopped loving her?<br />I really loved this book, I had a very hard time putting it down! I could sympathize completely with Katie, since I had been in her position before. Booker was an incredible character - strong, protective, loyal, and understanding. I kept wondering through the book how Katie had been able to leave him behind two years ago! There was an excellent cast of secondary characters, including Josh and Rebecca Hill, who had their own story in Brenda Novak's 'A Husband of Her Own.' Although there were several running subplots, the book didn't seem too 'busy,' and it just painted a great picture of real-life people struggling with real-life problems.<br />This book was an excellent story of second-chance love. Best of all, Brenda Novak is writing more stories about the characters in this book, so I will definitely keep my eye opened looking for more books from this great author! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great book to read. It's definitely a keeper!	2004-04-21

So when the opportunity for romance with Dr. Kyle Bingham, the most handsome available doctor at the hospital, presented itself, Milla wasn't exactly looking for a steady relationship.  If Kyle was anything like his famous playboy daddy, Milla wouldn't need to worry about commitment, anyway.  After one romantic night together, Milla was determined to push him away - until she discovered that she was pregnant with Kyle's baby.  <br />Dr. Kyle Bingham knew what it was like to grow up without a father - his own father had always financially supported him, but had never shown a personal interest in his life.  Now that Kyle's all grown up, he's following in his father's steps when the ladies are concerned.  That is until he meets Milla.  There's just something different about Milla, and he wants to get closer to her, except she kept pushing him away.  Kyle knew that Milla deserved a faithful husband and a dedicated father to their child - but could Kyle be that man?<br />For those who like medical romance, this is a great book to read, since a lot of it takes place in Merlyn County Hospital.  It's also great if you like books where the hero and heroine come from two different social spheres.  I enjoyed this book and read it in one sitting.  Milla's character is great - I love how she is so dedicated to caring for the baby she's going to have, and also the way she tries to be her orphaned cousin's mother-figure.  Dylan, her cousin, is completely adorable and loveable.  I didn't care for Kyle's character too much, since he spent most of the book trying to justify his womanizing ways, but he redeemed himself in my eyes eventually!  There's also plenty room for sequels, so that's something I like.  This one's a keeper.	2004-04-21

Tess Bucek can't help it that she has a wild imagination.  Living in the small town of Alouette on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan can be pretty boring, so the librarian escapes the monotony through reading books and using her very active imagination.  Fantasy is better than reality, after all, for in reality, she's the town spinster with a deceased fiance, and no one has treated her the same since the night Jared died.  Once she sees a tall, dark, and particularly handsome man lurking around in her library, she's quick to imagine that he's a smuggler...<br />Connor Reed is no smuggler, but he;s running from the big city in search of some peace and quiet.  A true crime writer, Connor inadvertently uncovers evidence that sets a notorious murderer free, and now everyone is quick to blame him for what isn;t his fault.  His elderly grandfather is in a nursing home near Alouette, and Connor is determined to fix up the lighthouse his grandfather used to run before his grandfather passes away.  He;d also love for his grandfather to learn how to read, and Tess seems like the perfect teacher for him.  Connor doesn;t realize, though, that Tess will be the one teaching him how to live again.  <br />I really enjoyed this book and the characters in it.  Connor is a great hero, but sometimes he was way too hard on himself and was a little too angst-ridden for my tastes.  There was an excellent cast of secondary characters, but sometimes I got lost trying to remember who was who and what ties they had to other characters in the book.  There is plenty of room for several sequels, so I am looking forward to reading those in the future!  I would especially be interested in reading a story about Cassia.  This book is definitely a keeper!	2004-04-21

At a young age, her drug-addicted mother and step-father sold her into prostitution to pay for their habits.  Angela, her street name being Gelina, refused to give in to despair, though, and after working as a prostitute for a few years, finally ran away from the horrible situation.  While fleeing, Tony spots her and Angela ducks into the first building she comes into, which happens to be a church.  While there, she hears the salvation message from a visiting evangelist and becomes a Christian.  After becoming a Christian, she flees from the city and sets up a nice life for herself in a small town, where she has friends, a steady job, and a good home.  One day, however, everything is turned upside down by her new preacher - Hosea Stevens.<br />Hosea Stevens never forgot the prostitute who had been saved six years before.  He was extremely happy to see that she now lived a well-adjusted life, but every time he got near her, she seemed to clam up and become flighty.  As his pastoral interest in her increases, so do his personal feelings, until he is sure that Angela is the woman God intends for him to marry.  The only problem is, Angela doesn't see herself as anything of value, and she's determined that her past doesn't come out.  Can Hosea convince her of his love, and of God's forgiveness?<br />I usually don't read Christian literature, but this one really caught my interest, perhaps because of the completely unusual heroine - a former prostitute.  It seems that you find virginal heroines in most Christian romance, so it was refreshing to find someone different!  I liked Angela and could completely relate to her feelings.  I also liked Hosea, who was determined and strong.  If you're looking for something a little different in Christian romance, I highly recommend this book!	2004-04-12

Marina Beaumont's family was in desperate straits, so she accepted the job as a companion to an older woman in London.  The country girl had no idea what she was getting herself into.  The older woman was Lady Luce, a notorious gambler who liked to wager high and often.  Worse yet, the Lady's son demanded that Marina keep Lady Luce from gambling - or Marina would be sent packing back to Yorkshire.  It didn't take long for Lady Luce to accrue a debt of 12,000 pounds to a mortal enemy, Kit Stratton.  If Lady Luce's son found out Marina had failed, he would surely send her back to her family penniless.  She somehow had to convince Kit, a notorious rake, to forgive Lady Luce's debt...and she'd do whatever it took!<br />Kit Stratton had lost big to Lady Luce once before and had been exiled to Austria after his older brother, Hugo, had bailed him out.  Kit returned from Austria five years later, determined to exact revenge on Lady Luce, by turning the tables and letting her feel how it was to have an unpayable debt.  The only problem was, Marina, Lady Luce's companion, was trying to convince him to forgive his debt - and his revenge on Lady Luce.  He agrees to pardon the debt on one condition - Marina must come willingly to his bed.  Will Marina take the chance of having her reputation ruined by this devilish rake to keep her position?<br />This book is a sequel to Joanna Maitland's &quot;Marrying the Major,&quot; and I enjoyed this book.  Hugo and Emma are both excellent secondary characters in this book, but the main focus is definitely on the turbulent and twisted world of London Society.  I like Marina - not only was she no raving beauty (she was described as being rather plain, and was often called &quot;the gray lady&quot;), but she had enough spunk and determination for two or three heroines.  I'm sorry to say, Kit was much less likeable.  I didn't particularly care for him in &quot;Marrying the Major,&quot; and I didn't particularly care for him in this book, either, although with age he did seem to gain a little more honorable behavior.<br />The plot was fast-moving and complicated, to be sure.  Life with Lady Luce was never boring!  So much time was spent on the plot, however, that love seemed to take a backseat in the book.  Once love came into the picture, I thought to myself, where did that come from?  I mean, I know it's a romance novel and love will pop up eventually, but there was little to no warning.  Kit and Marina seemed to just spar with one another, and then suddenly she knew she was in love with him.  Nor was there much passion in this book, either.  Altogether, though, it was an enjoyable book, and worthy of four stars.  It was definitely an interesting sequel to &quot;Marrying the Major,&quot; but can also stand on its own.	2004-03-22

The 22-year-old works as a waitress in Silver Wolf, Idaho, and has been taking care of her young brother, Corey, ever since their parents died.  After being diagnosed with skin cancer, though, she realizes how short life really is.  While in Lewiston, she decides to take a chance and is determined to lose her virginity to the handsome stranger who keeps eyeing her from across the bar. <br />James Dalton can't keep his eyes off the cute little blonde in the bar, but he knows if she knew who he really was, she'd run for the hills.  James Dalton is a man haunted by his past, a man who fears he has no future.  He can't help his attraction to the beautiful Emily, but he's determined to fight it.  Good thing he's moving to Silver Wolf, Idaho the next day, a few hours away from this town, and he'd never see the bewitching blonde again...<br />To be honest, when I first read the blurb on the back of the book, I thought that this would be an uncomplicated novel with some sizzle but not much substance.  Wrong!  I was hooked from the first page, and I was delighted to see a plot that was much more substantial than I thought it would be.  Emily had her own secrets to hide, and so did James.  I really liked both of the characters; Emily, because she was strong and determined, and James because he was desperately trying to do the right thing by Emily and her brother.  I really have a thing for complicated heroes, and I was not disappointed by James.<br />This book is a some-what sequel to &quot;Cherokee Dad&quot; by Sheri Whitefeather.  I haven't read that book yet, but I'm ordering it tonight!  Another book, &quot;A Kept Woman&quot; by the same author (to be released in April 2004), is going to deal with one of the secondary characters in this book, Zack Ryder.  &quot;Cherokee Stranger&quot; certainly stands on its own, and I really enjoyed it.  This book wasn't what I expected it to be, and I liked that.I definitely recommend this one!	2004-03-10

Dr. Rose Doeber never let anyone see her soft, emotional side.  She didn't earn the nickname Dr. Doeberman for nothing, after all.  Trust always equaled disappointment, and she was tired of being disappointed.  One night, though, as she sat beside the bed of three-year-old Dylan, a child who was abandoned and unwanted as she had been as a child, she let down her guard - and as soon as she did, Brendan MacDougal made his appearance like a man out of her dreams.  Only Brendan was flesh-and-blood...and although he made Rose's pulse quicken, she knew that she could never risk a relationship with him, or anyone.<br />Brendan loved kids, and although he came from an obscenely wealthy family, he chose to spend his time as chairman of a charity that raises money for children's causes.  His cause du jour is an expansion of the pediatric wing of the hospital Dr. Doeber works for.  His reputation has been severely tarnished, however, because he had trusted a woman who had absconded with millions.  Now even his most favorable donors are weary of donating their money to his charity, and Brendan needs someone to help him regain their trust.  Once he discovers that Rose isn't perfect, however, can he think of a future with her?<br />This book was pretty good, and those who love medical romances will certainly like this book, as a good portion of the book occurs in a hospital.  I found the subplots to be interesting and kept the book moving.  Every time I would come to the end of a chapter, I just HAD to read &quot;one more chapter,&quot; which ended up me staying up most of the night so I could finish the book!<br />The time frame of this book was completely unrealistic.  I think it spans about two weeks of their lives...I'm sorry, but how can you KNOW someone well enough to REALLY marry them in that space of time?  I just don't think it could happen.  Brendan's past is virtually ignored, and I doubt that Rose would know more about him than the reader, and marrying a virtual stranger just gives me the creeps.  <br />I really liked the character of Rose and I can completely relate to her.  Brendan's character never really clicked with me, though.  I don't know what it was...perhaps it was because he was so sketchy, not much was ever really told about him.  The focus was always on Rose, and though I didn't mind that, it definitely prevented Brendan's character from standing out.  Nevertheless, the book was a good read, and I liked it.	2004-03-06

Once the elder Mr. Hartwell passed away, her world came crashing down upon her.  It didn't help matters that Mr. Hartwell's only child, forest ranger David Hartwell, came into her life like a whirlwind and upset everything in his path.  Not only did he expect her to leave the isolation of the mountain she called home, but he stirred up feelings in her she had never felt before.<br />David Hartwell was used to women cringing once they looked at his face.  Scarred in an accident as a teen, he had given up on most human interaction and generally liked to keep to himself.  He was content to be a loner for most of the time, but now his father's pesky will insisted that he take care of Ellen until she had her upcoming surgery that may restore her sight.  So now he had to share his life with a woman he thought had been his father's mistress...and face the feelings that she evoked in him, longings for a family and a wife that he might never have fulfilled.  He was afraid to get too close to Ellen, but as she blended in with the small mountain community David now called home, he wondered if he could bear to have her leave.<br />This book was pretty good.  Neither of the characters were perfect; David had enough emotional baggage for a dozen people, and Ellen also had her own emotional hang-ups.  Sometimes they rubbed each other the wrong way - but as you read the book, you could see both Ellen and David grow in character strength and depth.  This book was a refreshing break from perfect people falling perfectly in love with no major obstacles in their way.  David was initially rough, Ellen was initially weak, but watching David soften and allow people into his heart, and Ellen gaining strength and independence she'd never had before...let's just say, I definitely got my money out of this book :)<br />There were a few rough patches, and a few parts when I thought David was a bit cruel when he dealt with Ellen...but altogether, a lovely book that not only shows the depth of human emotions, but allows you to experience them as you read this book.  Definitely a keeper!	2004-03-06

That was exactly what he found waiting for him in his quarters one night, though, and he was completely shocked at the &quot;joke&quot; that had been played upon them both.  Although he was fast approaching 40 and had always longed for a family of his own, he was dedicated to serving as a doctor in the Mounties regiment.  He valiently tried to save the lives of his fellow soldiers and the locals, but he couldn't get over the fact that he had lost his best friend, Wesley, to a raid by a cattle-rustling gang.  It'd take a special woman to put up with the demanding life he led!<br />Sarah O'Neill was a special woman...John just didn't know it quite yet.  She had come west with an ulterior motive, but John didn't know THAT, either.  Once John told her of the cruel joke that had sent her out west, Sarah was determined to stay in town and make it on her own!  As John and Sarah spent time around one another, though, neither could deny the attraction that was building between them - but was attraction enough when neither could trust the other?<br />This book was really different.  Not only was it set in the Canadian West (something I know very little about, and was such a refreshing break from the traditional American West), but the heroine wasn't a virgin (a &quot;non-traditional&quot; heroine - I love it!), and the relationship between the two wasn't perfect right away.  This book was, therefore, was quite different - and that made it that more interesting.  Even better, there was real character growth in the book - something that I always enjoy to read about.  Unfortunately, I usually have a knack at figuring out the ending, and I did this time, too.  Nevertheless, this was a good book, and a keeper in my opinion.	2004-03-06

Maria Markham was a spunky Southern lady who had survived the Civil War, and now was surviving the Union occupation of her state, as well.  Sometimes it was difficult, though, with the Union commander of the town staying in her own house.  The new commander of the town, Colonel Max Woodard, seemed a bit different from the previous commander, though; and sometimes Maria was disarmed by his kindness toward his vanquished foes.  There are secrets, however, that Maria is determined to keep to herself - and no matter how different Max appears to be, she can't share them with anyone.<br />Colonel Max Woodard was once a prisoner at a squallid prison camp located in the area; now he was the commander of the entire town.  Despite his bitter memories of the place, he is determined to act in a fair manner, even when Maria seems intent to keep him at a distance or openly snub him.  Could they learn to love one another, or would any feelings they had toward each other be denied because of their pasts?<br />This book was an okay book, but I wasn't particularly thrilled with it, either.  Maria is nothing short of confusing, and once things are revealed later in the book, I was even more confused.  I can't give away what I'm talking about, though; suffice to say that her feelings seemed to wax hot one moment and cold another.  She also never really gave Max a chance most of the time; instead of getting to know him a little, she would avoid him as much as possible or snub him when she got the opportunity to do so.  Max showed her several kindnesses early on, but that didn't matter to her.<br />Max's character was obviously very impacted by his stay in a prison camp, but that really wasn't discussed much.  I don't know if it was discussed in Ms. Reavis' prequel to this book (The Prisoner) or not, but it would have really helped me if she had fleshed that part of Max's character out a bit.  <br />Really, this whole book seemed a bit blah to me, and it never really got me too interested in it.  It's an okay read, but I doubt I'll read it again.	2004-03-06

She hopes to teach them to read and write to help them in their freedom, and she loves working with the &quot;contrabands,&quot; as the former slaves are called.  Elizabeth soon finds herself unexplicably drawn to Quinn Erskine, the commander at the refugee camp.  <br />When Quinn first sees beautiful Elizabeth, he's convinced that she won't stay.  No one from the Northern &quot;do good&quot; societies ever stay for very long.  He soon learns, however, that Elizabeth is quite the determined lady and isn't so easily put off.  Quinn still isn't sure if Elizabeth is strong enough to help him ease the pain and bitterness gnawing away in his heart.  A native of Tennessee, Quinn chooses to be loyal to the Union - and loses nearly everything.  Can Quinn and Elizabeth rebuild their lives in this war-torn land, or will their love be destroyed just like everything else?<br />I am a fanatic about finishing a book once I start it.  If I don't finish a book I start, I feel incomplete until I do so.  Therefore, there are very, VERY few books I ever leave unfinished.  This book was one of the ones I couldn't finish.<br />The premise of the book isn't so bad.  I rather like historicals set in the Civil War, although Harlequin doesn't seem to publish many of them.  The pro-Union rhetoric in this book was so thick, however, that anyone with a remote sense of what actually happened in the Civil War probably won't be able to stomach this book.  I only read 124 pages, but in those pages, all of the native white Southerners were evil (except, of course, pro-Union Quinn), whereas nearly every white Northener there was just a wonderful human being.  President Lincoln was akin to a saint; President Davis was akin to the devil.  It really got tiresome.<br />Elizabeth was one of the most annoying characters I have ever read about in a historical romance.She is so utterly GOOD, she doesn't even have one little flaw.  She's completely perfect, or at least this is how the author wants to portray her.  As I read the book, however, I began to notice something that disturbed me.  Much ado was made about Elizabeth helping the &quot;contrabands,&quot; but she never really refered to them as people.  They were always &quot;contrabands,&quot; or &quot;former slaves,&quot; or something of that nature.  All of the African-Americans were remarkably flat, had no character at all, and just about worshipped the wonderful Miss Whitley.  It felt like the African-Americans in the story lived only to please Miss Whitley.  That really upset me - at least treat the African-Americans as PEOPLE, not as pet projects or, even worse, objects.<br />Finally, the love story didn't pan it for me.  The two characters rarely saw one another and practically never spoke, but they were in love with one another.  There was no sharing of ideas, no romance, they just fawned after one another from afar and then labeled whatever they felt as love.  I felt like I was getting dumber just reading this book, it was written on such a juvenile emotional level.<br />Save your money and your brain cells, don't read this book.	2004-03-02

Three best friends made a pact with one another - find their first loves, and see how they are doing.  Charlotte Moore's first love was Liam Connery, a friend of her older sister's with an accent and dreams of being a pilot, someone she hadn't seen since she was a kid.  She discovers he's not a pilot, though, and instead raises dogs in the rural town of Petty Cove.  Liam is also very different from what she thought he would be - he's quiet, brooding, and really down-right rude at times.  There seems to be an attraction between them, but he keeps pushing her away, leaving Charlotte confused.<br />Liam can't deny that he feels attraction for the real estate appraiser who threw herself into his life unexpectedly, but there are secrets in his past that force him to keep her at bay.  His self-control doesn't seem to be a match for Charlotte, however, especially since she warms up quickly to his blind and lonely mother.  Once his secrets come out, however, will Charlotte still want to be with this dark and mysterious man?<br />This book nearly bored me to tears.  I am obsessive about finishing books, but this is one of the very few books I have ever not been able to finish.  I got to page 170, got sick of the entire story, and put the book down.  The back cover says that Charlotte is like Jane Eyre, and Liam is like Mr. Rochester, and yet that couldn't be farther from the truth.  Sure, there are a few similarities, but not enough to warrant a favorable comparison to one of the best books ever written (Jane Eyre) in my humble opinion.  Liam is definitely NO Mr. Rochester, and Charlotte is NO Jane Eyre.  Charlotte Moore is an incredibly boring book, and a total waste of time to read.<br />I'd recommend you read Jane Eyre instead, it's much better :)	2004-02-16
US	23595366	R170T06L3ULVVU	0373218338	582397391	Charmed Destinies: 3 Novels in 1	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Three good short stories	Each of these three short stories were very good, and I had a hard time putting the book down!  The first story in the book, &quot;Counting Crows&quot; by Mercedes Lackey, was the darkest of the three romances.  Lady Gwynnhwyfar and her maid, Robin, travel to the borderlands to meet Gwynn's new husband - a man she has never met before in her life.  Once Gwynn arrives, however, she discovers that Duke Bretagne is hardly the ideal husband - he is brutal, vicious, and disgusting.  After cruelly raping her on their wedding night, Gwynn is determined to use her magical powers to better her situation.  Meanwhile, her old childhood crush, Sir Atremus, lives in Clawcrag Keep as well, a knight who is now crippled thanks to Bretagne's blasé treatment of his knights.  Lady Gwynn and Sir Atremus establish a quick friendship, but nothing can ever come of it - unless Gwynn's magical powers can truly change her life.<br />I loved &quot;Counting Crows,&quot; even though it was a rather dark romance, not of the light and fluffy variety.  Bretagne's treatment of Lady Gwynn is disgraceful, and more than once I almost set the book aside because I could no longer bear to see the heroine treated in such a way, while her love is in the same castle with her, knowing what she is going through, yet pretty much powerless to do anything about it.  Whoever typed the descriptions on the back of the book did a horrible job - not only did they butcher Gwynnhwyfar's name (it was spelled Gwynhefar), but Sir Artemus is called &quot;Sir Elloran.&quot;  There is no Sir Elloran in the book, and I kept wondering when Sir Elloran was going to make his appearance, meanwhile wondering why Sir Artemus was getting closer to Gwynn when she was supposed to fall in love with Elloran!  It took me a while to figure this out, because I'm slow like that :)  An excellent story, though, and probably quite true to life - I am sure there were a great many loveless marriages in medieval times.<br />The next story is &quot;Drusilla's Dream&quot; by Rachel Lee.  Every night Drusilla goes to the same boring job and secretly daydreams while she enters in boring data.  This particular night, however, cute Miles Kennedy, her boss, keeps popping into her fantasy.  Things aren't going the way Drusilla wants them to go in her fantasy, either - the hero in her story (Miles, of course!) never reacts quite in the way she would expect him to.  What's really going on in Drusilla's dream?  This story was a fun little story and definitely lightened the mood after reading the &quot;Counting Crows&quot; story.  The characters were funny, realistic, and quite clever.  This is a light, quirky romance, something that makes you feel good when you read it, but something you don't rememeber the details of once you've completed the story.<br />The final story is &quot;Moonglow&quot; by Catherine Asaro.  I loved this story as well!  Iris Larkspur feels out of place learning how to use the magic her teacher believes is deep inside of her, but Iris seems to be unable to harness.  It doesn't help matters that Chime, her classmate, is just about perfect, from her golden hair to her feet.  Iris, in an amazing moment, however, discovers her power - and also discovers that the prince of her land, long thought dead, is actually alive.  Once Prince Jarid is found, he must return to assume power of the kingdom, but he is blind, deaf, and mute.  And since Iris is now the most powerful mage in the land, she must marry the Prince - and at the same time, try to heal his broken spirit.  <br />I really liked Iris and Jarid - both of them were outsiders, and yet there was such a bond between them, almost instantly.  &quot;Moonglow&quot; was an interesting story, and I'm really looking forward to the next book by Catherine Asaro.  Altogether, I liked all three of the stories, just in a different way.  Each story appealed to me on a different level, and it's rare to find that in a book.  I'll definitely be reading this bookagain!	2004-02-16

She loves playing with the kids in her care, and even comes in on her off time to spend time playing with the children.  Even she's surprised, however, when she invites her boss Sam Taylor, called &quot;Mr. Frosty&quot; because of his glacial demeanor, to an after-hours hangout.  She's even more surprised when he accepts - and his frosty exterior starts to warm up a little.<br />Sam Taylor keeps himself closed off from everyone - his staff, his family, even the children under his care at the pediatric unit.  So he's more than a little surprised when Jodie - fun-loving, adorable, interesting Jodie - tries to engage him in conversation.  He finds Jodie irrisistable, but he knows that the only thing he can offer her is a short-term affair.  Sam knows that he is infertile, and the bittersweet torture of spending all of his professional time around children doesn't compare to the tortue of knowing that he can't give Jodie what she'll eventually want - a baby.  His first marriage broke up over his infertility, and he's convinced that he's completely unsuitable for marriage - especially to someone as wonderful as Jodie.  So after a short affair, Sam is determined to cut himself out of Jodie's life - but Jodie isn't so ready to give up on him!<br />I really liked the premise of this story, but something just fell flat in this book.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, and I really did enjoy it.  I loved both Jodie and Sam, they were a perfect match for one another, and the fact that the romance was set in a pediatric ward was a definite plus to this nursing student :)  I loved the cast of secondary characters, who were all sufficiently fleshed out, but not to the point of taking over the entire story, and even the foreign lingo didn't slow me down, although English is not my native language.  I was never quite sure if this story was set in Australia or England, though.  <br />Anyway, the part that somewhat annoyed me was the repetitive arguments between Sam and Jodie once they know they like each other.  I mean, there is only so many ways to say, &quot;Hey, you want a baby, I can't have a baby, let's not get together.&quot;  The fact that Sam and Jodie didn't even seriously consider the alternatives to having a biological child - adoption, for a very big example - kind of rankled me.  I just wanted to yank them each out of the story, give them a good shake, and say, &quot;It's not the end of the world, you know!  You can always adopt!&quot;  <br />That was really the only thing that bothered me, however.  In short, this was a very interesting book, and a reversal on the &quot;woman is infertile, man wants children&quot; theme that I have read in several books.  Pick this one up, even if you don't usually like medical romances, I'm sure that you'll like this one :)	2004-02-16
US	23595366	R28P66YV0TUSAE	0373290276	675110448	The Last Rogue	Books	1	25	29	N	N	A good premise, but falls far short of the goal	Raleigh is not surprised when he wakes up one morning with a hangover - but he is very surprised when he discovers that he has spent the night with an unattractive virgin in his bed, and now he must marry her since he has compromised her!  Raleigh does the honorable thing and marries Jane Trowbridge, the sister-in-law of one of his friends, and takes her with him to his parents' home, and then to the estate he inherited from his late great-uncle.  Raleigh is disappointed, however, that he, the match maker of all his friends, is now saddled with a wife who does not love him, nor does he love.<br />Jane Trowbridge, the compromised virgin with an inferiority complex the size of Wales, never thought that she would marry someone like Raleigh.  In fact, she wondered if she'd ever marry at all.  And now that she was married, she couldn't have married a more unsuitable fellow, in her opinion.  Not only was Raleigh from a wealthy family, but he was obsessed with fashion, food, and pleasure - things that Jane found frivilous at best.  How could this unlikely pair even grow to LIKE one another, much less fall in love?<br />Okay, I will be quite honest and say that I do not like this book at all.  I won't go so far as to say I hate it, because hate is too strong of an emotion, but I was pretty apathetic while reading this book.  Raleigh is a bit &quot;fluffy&quot; for my tastes, and I doubt that he has more than one serious bone in his entire body, but I felt very sorry for him to be forced to marry someone like Jane.  Jane is absolutely unlikeable.  I really tried to see where she was coming from, to have sympathy for her, to understand her motivations, but frankly I have come to the conclusion that Jane is just the most nasty, sour, temperamental, irritable, cruel, unkind shrew known to mankind.  From the start of her marriage, she never tried to make things work with Raleigh, although he was doing his best to be kind and considerate of her.  I felt so incredibly sorry for Raleigh, to be tied to such an unpleasable woman.  Several times, I wish I could just reach out and slap Jane a few times.  There is no excuse, no matter how big your inferiority complex is, to treat someone in such a way.<br />I was incredibly concerned for Raleigh's sanity, therefore, when he fell in love with Jane's personality.  I do not know what there was in her personality to fall in love with, unless he had a serious desire for emotional harm to come to him.  Jane was very rarely kind to him - she was kind to everyone else, it seemed, but her own husband - and I never could understand what he would ever see in her.  And quite frankly, both characters had me annoyed with their sniffs and squeaks (Jane) and hums (Raleigh).  If Jane sniffed so much, I would think she was coming down with the flu, and if Raleigh hummed constantly around me, I would be more than a little annoyed with him.  This book was just bad, and nothing could really salvage it after Jane's high-handedness came into full view.  Don't waste your money with this one - there are plenty of better regency novels out there!	2004-02-16
US	23595366	R3RBPJY4789S5Y	0373750080	316556333	Want Ad Wedding	Books	5	0	0	N	N	An excellent small-town romance!	Molly Flynn has had just about enough of her new boss.  Not only is he trying to completely change the newspaper she works for around, but he's so darned smug about everything!  One day Molly's temper gets the best of her, and she writes a fake want ad describing her conceited, arrogant, unresponsive, and cold boss.  She never meant for it to end up in the paper...but it did, and now Molly is sure she'll lose her job.<br />Sam Reed is surprised when he reads the personal ad in the paper - and intrigued.  For weeks, he has been incredibly drawn to the ace reporter at the Sentinal, and now he sees his chance to get to know her better.  Sam convinces Molly to pretend that they have been seeing each other for a while, so the townspeople and editorial staff at the paper will believe that they only had a lover's quarrel that led to the publication of the now-notorious want ad.  Only Sam doesn't want this relationship to be a pretend one at all...<br />Sam and Molly were both interesting characters.  Molly is impulsive (as evidenced in the want ad placement), energetic, and warm.  Sam, on the other hand, holds himself aloof, likes to think things through (sometimes he thinks way too much), and more sedate.  Not only are Molly's and Sam's personalities completely opposite, but they come from different environments and have different goals in life.  Molly loves her small-town life, her close-knit family, and the people of Payne.  Sam grew up in Boston, the illegitimate son of a newspaper tycoon, and is not nearly as trusting as Molly.  He also has little sense of permanence and forever - and those are the two things Molly wants most.  <br />Their differences set up a lot of conflict, and Molly's temper was quite interesting to watch.  The book didn't sag in the middle, as so many do, and in fact the entire story was pretty fast-paced and interesting.  The secondary characters were good, and I especially liked Sam's flamboyant half-sister, Taylor Reed.  Best of all, this bookseemed real, almost like it could really happen.  So many times in romance novels, everything seems like it's taking place in some alternate universe.  This book felt like something that could happen to you, or your best friend.  I like that :)  Excellent book, excellent love story, and a definite keeper!	2004-02-16

One day, she believes that she has a perfect life - a wonderful, caring doctor husband who adores her, a baby on the way, and a comfortable, financially-secure lifestyle.  The next day, her life literally goes up in flames - she discovers that her &quot;devoted husband&quot; really had a mistress on the side and had died in her arms from smoke inhalation, her life isn't so financially secure thanks to her husband's reckless spending, and everything she had ever hoped for is gone.  The only small comfort in her life is the child she is expecting, her own little miracle baby.<br />Dillon, Emily's brother-in-law, is determined to take care of his brother's wife, despite having kept her at a distance for the seven years of her marriage.  Emily does not know that her handsome, brooding brother-in-law has been in love with her since he first met her.  Emily also does not know that it isn't her husband's child she is carrying, after all - but Dillon's child.  Can Dillon win Emily's heart after finally given the opportunity, or will the secrets he keeps tear them apart before they can begin?<br />I really enjoyed this story.  Dillon was a great hero - strong, intense, and fiercely devoted to Emily and the baby.  Emily was also a great heroine for him - she too had a strong character, which was obvious when she kept going even after the fullness of her husband's betrayals became known to her.  Some of the secondary characters (particularly Adele, Emily's mother-in-law) were one-dimensional and could have been fleshed out a little more, but that's not a major flaw in the story line or anything like that.  Dillon and Emily's relationship progressed over time and seemed completely natural, almost like this could really happen in real life :)  So if you want to spend a few hours with a pleasant, heart-warming read, pick up this book!  :)	2004-02-02

Born and raised in North Carolina, she was brutally raped as revenge for her father's Northern sympathies.  With nothing left for her in North Carolina, she flees to Richmond, only to become a singer in a saloon.  She soon finds herself singing for soldiers in the Confederate army, and nursing the wounded back to health.  She herself is still wounded from her rape and the rejection by her former fiance after he discovered she was raped.  She does not remember everything from that night, but she remembers the Hardin boys raping her - and the strange cat-like eyes of a stranger.<br />Confederate Captain Ryan Tanner is the unfortunate owner of those cat-like eyes.  He knows that he remembers the flaming-haired beauty from somewhere, but he just can't place it, desperate as he is to discover why Belinda recoils in horror every time she sees him.  Through a series of events that bring the pair closer together, Belinda feels a flutter of hope - but will she allow it to grow, or will it be crushed by the demons of her past?<br />This is a really good Civil War era romance.  For those who like historical detail along with the romance, this is a good one for you.  I am no Civil War scholar, but I did pay attention in history class in high school sometimes :)  Some of the battle descriptions did get a little boring to me, but then again I have always been a bit distracted when it comes to such things.  The scene, however, is always well-described.<br />The characters were both intriguing to me.  Belinda was a complex character, and the depths of her emotional scars were visible even as she displayed immense courage in other areas.  Ryan was also a complex character, although not as well-developed as Belinda.  Much ado was made about Belinda's past, and yet Ryan's past remains pretty much in the dark.  I also didn't like how arrogant he was - at times he was sensitive and loving, and at other times he would adopt the &quot;me man, you woman, you obey me&quot; caveman routine out of the blue.  He didn't seem to be very stable.  There are also some secondary characters, but most of them are only in the story briefly and are rather flat in comparison.  <br />My major complaint with this novel is the fact that there are WAY too many coincidences to be believable.  Although Belinda travels around a lot (I don't want to give any of the plot away), she keeps on meeting up with people from her very small hometown in North Carolina, or with people she met previously in the story.  I would think, with nine million people in the Confederacy alone, it would be a small miracle to run into anyone from your old hometown, but to constantly run into people from her past was just plain weird.  It may have helped the plot along, but it sure didn't have much logic to it. <br />Speaking of lack of logic - it was also strange that everywhere Belinda went, someone inevitably wanted to rape her.  Okay, being raped for revenge is believable.  Being threatened with rape constantly every time you move into a new situation or location is not so believable.  The ending left a little to be desired, there wasn't as much closure as I could have wished for.  Still, I think the book is still pretty good overall, and definitely worth the few hours I spent reading it.	2004-01-23

The embittered Civil War veteran moves to the Double F ranch, which had belonged to the man he had called uncle, hoping to find a place to rest.  The place offers him little refuge from the emotions and memories that plague him, however, and he is presented with new problems - dealing with his uncle's death, trying to make a broken-down ranch prosperous once again, and fighting his growing attraction for the housekeeper, Amber, who is rumored to be a \\"soiled dove\\" and the former mistress of his uncle.  <br />Amber knows what it is like to be alone in the world - she had virtually no one left.  Her father was dead, and so was her protector, Richard Fontaine.  She buries her hurt and painful memories in her heart, trying to appear indifferent to the world.  She soon realizes, however, that she is hardly indifferent to Derek, despite the mental torment from his own pain.  Can this pair face their demons and conquer them, or will they always be ruled by hurt and pain?<br />I really, really liked this book.  Amber and Derek were both amazing characters.  In so many romance novels, the characters fall flat or are two-dimensional, but that is definitely not the case in this book!  Both of the primary characters were rich in detail and complex individuals.  The cast of secondary characters was also incredibly awesome - Gideon and Beau both deserve their own books, and I will be very disappointed if I never hear from either again!  The devastation, emotional and physical, from the Civil War was so obvious in this book, something that is often overlooked in other books.  People didn't come home from the Civil War without mental baggage, and this book portrays that in an incredible, believable fashion.<br />This is an amazing debut - I couldn't get over how the author could just get inside of the characters' heads and manage to beautifully convey each character's motivation, thoughts, and feelings.  Even though I didn't agree with some of the characters' choices, I could perfectly understand why they chose to act a certain way, because the author made sure to let the reader know what the characters' thought processes were.  My only criticism is a couple of loose ends left in the book, but it's a perfect set up for a sequel (please, please, please let there be a sequel!!!).  I really can't sing this book's praises loud enough or long enough - it's an awesome book!!  This book easily earns five stars, and I really hope that I read more from this author in the future!	2004-01-17

He stole her heart, but when he discovered that she was the daughter of Saul Donovan, the owner of the NHL hockey team he had just joined, he had to break up with her.  He left to pursue his hockey dreams, leaving a broken-hearted Emma behind without a second glance.  Emma forged a quiet life for herself, becoming a wedding planner and working for Joe's mother, who had no clue about the history between Emma and her youngest son.<br />Joe Hart still remembered Emma.  He had loved her, but once he discovered who Emma really was, he found himself heartbroken and sent packing by her father, back to the minor leagues.  Seven years later, however, Joe returns to the Carolina Storm - with the condition that he will steer clear of Emma for good.  Fate, however, has different plans for Emma and Joe.  As Joe stays the night at Emma's parents' house, he unexpectedly runs into Emma again, creating a public scandal.  To make matters worse, it is soon revealed that Joe and Emma eloped seven years ago - and they're still legally married!  Can the couple recapture the love they once had for one another?<br />I loved this book!  The plot was fast-moving and exciting from the first few pages of the book, and it didn't let up until the end!  The author makes this story seem entirely plausible, even if the secret elopement is a bit far-fetched.  Both of the characters seem so real, however, that the practicality of the elopement is long forgotten.  Emma is completely believable, from her fears to her emotions, and Joe is a hot Southern boy who has to struggle with his own emotions towards Emma.  They're an awesome combination!<br />The struggles that the couple goes through are realistic, and the author does an excellent job of creating engaging sub-plots as well.  A cast of realistic, interesting secondary characters is introduced.  The sex scenes are hot andnever stale.  Altogether, I can't think of anything this romance is lacking!<br />This book is the first book in a 6-book series, \\"The Brides of Holly Springs,\\" and I can't wait to read the other five!  This book is definitely on my keeper shelf, and I can't wait to read more from this author.	2004-01-12

An immigrant from Ireland, where she starved in the streets after her parents died, she was sold to Blackjack Kingston, a cruel miner who chained her to a bed, raped her for four months, horribly scarred her, and then left her to die in the South Dakota wilderness.  Serena, alone in the wilderness, hears a group of Lakota women being raped and comes to their rescue, saving the life of at least one Lakota child with the group, but sustains injuries herself.  The Lakota, thankful for her help, take her back to their village, and she is placed in the tent of Black Wolf, the tribe's medicine man.<br />Black Wolf, intune with the spirit world as the medicine man of his Lakota tribe, instantly names Serena &quot;Cante Tinza,&quot; or Brave Heart.  He can see that her heart is brave, but she has been mistreated for so long, would she ever learn to trust a man and grow to love him?  He's determined to be gentle and show her the way love is supposed to be, but there are so many obstacles to their love - Serena's distrust of men, a jealous Lakota maiden, Blackjack Kingston, to name a few - will their tender love be allowed to bloom, or will it be crushed before it has a chance to heal both of them?<br />I was in awe of the historical detail of this book - the author's knowledge of Lakota customs, from the mundane to the sacred, is absolutely incredible!  For the historical detail alone, the book earns at least 5 stars, but interwoven with the history is such a tender love story, tears were brought to my eyes several times over.  <br />Cante Tinza (Serena) is such a wonderful heroine, and Black Wolf is the perfect hero.  Neither are the typical stereotypes found in many historical romance novels.  Black Wolf is not an arrogant jerk, but is a healer, a lover, someone who treats women with respect and kindness.  Cante Tinza (Serena) is not the starry-eyed virgin who is repulsed by prejudice against Native Americans.It's quite easy to see how love develops between them and sustains them through it all.  <br />This book was absolutely amazing and incredible, easily one of my favorite historical romance novels ever!  I am definitely placing this book on my keeper shelf, and I imagine that I will read the book several more times in the future, just to immerse myself in such a tender love story between two absolutely wonderful characters.	2004-01-12
US	23595366	RSKB543TOIWE9	0373292899	184929306	Marrying The Major	Books	4	4	4	N	N	An enjoyable afternoon read	When Hugo Stratton left England for the Penninsular Campaign, Emma Fitzwilliam was a young hoyden, more at ease climbing trees and playing rough than being the proper lady.  In the years since, however, Emma has become the epitome of womanhood, from her polite conversation to her manner of dress.  The toast of Society, Emma is still unmarried at age 23, wary of fortune-hunters who merely want to acquire her fortune.  Once her childhood acquaintance returns from war, however, she finds herself aflame with desire for him.<br />Hugo Stratton is bitter and weak from his wounds.  When a friend found him in Europe, he was barely alive and had been dreadfully wounded.  He is not the man Emma remembers so fondly from childhood, for Hugo has lost most of his teasing ways and has become a jaded man.  His fondest wish is to retire to the country and stay far away from society, but Emma is determined to draw him from his self-imposed exile and help him regain his strength, humor, and abilities.  Hugo has feelings for Emma, but he knows he can never have her - until fate presents him a golden opportunity he simply cannot refuse.<br />One of the biggest positives of this book is the strong cast of secondary characters.  In many romance novels, secondary characters are rarely mentioned and are even more rarely fleshed out to any degree.  This is not the case in Marrying the Major - there is a delightfully complete cast of secondaries, including Emma's meddling aunt, Emma's friends and neighbors Richard and Jamie, the Dowager (Richard's mother), Hugo's younger brother Kit, and Emma's indulgent father.  Richard and Jamie are the most prominent in the story, offering support, advice, and a glimpse of wedded bliss.  For those who are interested, Richard and Jamie's story appears in a book entitled &quot;A Penniless Prospect,&quot; by the same author.<br />I have two minor criticisms of the book, the first being some of the underdeveloped sub-plots.  Hugo's fued with someone from his past, for example, was woefully underdeveloped and left me with a &quot;huh?&quot; at the conclusion of that sub-plot.  Some of the sub-plots seemed like mere filler.  My second minor criticism is the amount of time that lapses in the book before any real romance starts.  The first half of the book is dedicated to events and situations leading up to the romance that will eventually develop, but I thought too much time was spent on events that could have been dealt with in a chapter or two.  <br />Still, the book is a good one, and I'd probably read it again.  It was an enjoyable read, with solid history interwoven with a blossoming romance, and I did end up reading it straight through!  I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.	2004-01-09

After she learns that her wealthy father is going to travel west for adventure, Lily decides that she simply must go with him - she dreams of spending time with the father she barely knows and building their dreams in Santa Fe.  She isn't prepared for the hardships she faces on the trail, her father's untimely death, the well-kept secret he tells her, or being deserted at a fort by her wagon party.  Worst of all, she has accrued a debt at the fort, and the men of the fort insist she pay it back - one way or another.<br />North Walker, a half-Cheyenne horse trader, knows that Lily St. Claire is trouble from the moment he saw her, but that doesn't stop him from &quot;buying&quot; her once she's in trouble.  He wants her to teach his young sister the manners and customs of the East, and once she completes this task, he'll be more than happy to take her back East and be rid of Lily once and for all!  The west is filled with danger and is no place for a lady like Lily...but when it comes time to take her back East, can North really let her go?<br />This book really had a good premise, and I believed that I would enjoy it immensely.  Although it was an okay book, it's not one that I would read again.  The book lags considerably in the middle, and it's quite boring in the middle - I was debating over whether I could actually bring myself to finish this book.  For much of the book, the only setting is North's remote cabin or the immediate surrounding area, and I just got bored of it.  There was not much to keep my interest!  The book picked up in the end, but by that time it was too late to save it, and it felt like everything was crammed into the last 50 pages.  There were loose ends left at the end, which disturbed me, as I like everything to end up nice and tidy at the end of a book.  The book also read more like an Intrigue novel, which I suppose isn't too surprising since this historical series is the forerunner of the &quot;Colorado Confidential&quot; in the Harlequin Intrigue series.  Unfortunately, I don't care much for Intrigue novels...<br />Despite the title, there is little &quot;Cheyenne&quot; in the book.  The Cheyenne village pops up once in a great while, but it's never a major theme.  North seemed almost completely divorced from his Cheyenne roots, which was disappointing, especially since he presumably spent at least part of his life growing up in a Cheyenne village.  Although the stereotypes Lily has of Native Americans at first are historical, I didn't like her harping on them.  Altogether, this book was okay, but it's not something that I will read again.	2004-01-08

Investigative journalist Brooke Hollister's professional life couldn't be better - after she completes a story on the Rancho Encantado, she has the opportunity to interview a reclusive, yet popular, star that is sure to boost her career.  Her personal life, however, is in shambles - her boyfriend told her that he wasn't ready to commit and walked out of her life, Brooke discovers that she is due to have his child in about six months, and her rat of an ex wants nothing to do with the child!  Brooke is sure that all of the hoopla surrounding the Rancho Encantado is nothing more than a publicity stunt, and she's determined to prove it, while keeping her pregnancy a secret.<br />The ranch manager of Rancho Encantado, Cord McCall, is lucky to be alive, and he knows it.  After surviving a rough childhood, he survived the rodeo and getting his back broken in a traffic accident.  His past still haunts him though, along with unnamed secrets that are best left in the back of his mind.  He adopts his aloof, unapproachable manner to keep people away and to avoid hurt, but he can't seem to get rid of Brooke Hollister.  Once he is assigned to show her around the ranch, he is pulled into an emotional quandry, battling feelings for her that he believes he has no right to feel.<br />I enjoyed this book.  It was well-written, with a bit of romance and a bit of history wrapped together.  I especially liked the setting - in the middle of a desert with mountains surrounding the area.  The American West does something for me!  I was a little annoyed at the author's overuse of &quot;to the extreme&quot; and &quot;to the max,&quot; a little too Valley Girl for my tastes.  The characters were complex and interesting, and I could really empathize with Brooke's predicament.  I definitely took her side, so much so that I wanted to slug Cord a few times!  The book didn't have much &quot;romance&quot; in it though - both of the characters were dealing with a lot of emotional issues, and the romance almost seemed to be a subtheme instead of the main theme.  Still, it had enough oomph to keep my interest, and earned four stars in my book.	2004-01-07

She's successfully managed her own estate for over a year, but the king declares that she must marry one of his knights.  Determined to outfox the king, Aisley picks the Red Knight, a fearsome warrior by reputation who has not been seen in months.  Rumor has it that the Red Knight is in league with the devil and practices black arts as he hides in perpetual darkness, but Aisley is undeterred - she wants someone to refuse to marry her, and she believes the Red Knight is the only one who will reject the king's edict.<br />Piers, the Red Knight, has been shrouded in darkness for too long, and when Aisley disrupts his sedate life, she is like a bright ray of sunshine.  He has no intentions of rejecting the king's request, and before he knows it, Aisley is staying in his castle Dunmorrow for good.  Piers is loathe to give away all his secrets, however, and Aisley is left wondering - why does her husband keep himself locked away in the darkness?  Is he truly a sorcerer, or is he hiding some other secret?<br />I usually don't go for medieval romances, but this one was excellent!  I could scarcely bear to put the book down - as another reviewer said, start this book in the morning or you will be up all night (like me!).  The characters are lovely and complex, the author keeps up a slight mysterious tension throughout the first half of the book as you wonder why exactly the Red Knight cloaks himself in darkness, and there is a wonderful literary play between light and darkness, sunshine and shadows.  The book was also incredibly sexy, with powerful love scenes and a clear view of the tender love growing between the two characters inspite of the hardships they faced.  The book had a Phantom of the Opera feel to it, and I loved it, I was completely captivated by this book!  Definitely a keeper, and I am looking forward to reading the sequel to the book, Maiden Bride by the same author.	2004-01-06

Compromised years ago through an unfortunate incident with a cowardly soldier, she has resigned herself to living a good life helping the less fortunate on the seedier side of London with her friend, a penniless vicar, and is quite content to remain the spinster.  Lady Rowe's grandmother, a rich widow, has other plans for her only grand-daughter, however.<br />Viscount Stratton is an adventurer, a man who lives for self-indulgence and reckless behavior.  Although many women had tried to lure him to the altar before, each one had left sorely disappointed.  As a new viscount, he inherited a run-down manor near the sea.  A great deal of money is required to fix up the place, and he loans money he needs to a good friend, Lady Elizabeth's grandmother.  When Lady Elizabeth's grandmother insists that she cannot pay her debt, the only solution the grandmother presents is for the Viscount to marry Lady Elizabeth for her sizeable dowry.  The Viscount agrees to the marriage...but is it for Elizabeth's dowry, or is it for love?<br />I really enjoyed this book after I got past the first 50 pages or so.  It took me quite a while to get into the characters of the book, particularly the grandmother (Mrs. Sampson) and Lady Elizabeth.  After I got interested in the sparring matches between Elizabeth and the Viscount, however, I couldn't put the book down!  The last 200 pages are so much better than the first couple of chapters, and there isn't really a dull point in the book after the first couple of chapters.  The characters are realistic, three-dimensional, and thoroughly delightful.  Best yet, the author clearly goes through the steps to show us how and why each character chooses their actions - something that is often lacking in many romance novels.<br />For those readers who don't like hot and heavy sex scenes, good news - there aren't any in this book.  Instead, the author focuses more on dialog and plot instead of sex, although there is unmistakable attraction between the Viscount and Elizabeth.  Quite frankly, this is one of the best historical romance novels I have read lately, and it's definitely staying on my keeper shelf!n dialog and plot instead of sex, although there is unmistakable attraction between the Viscount and Elizabeth.

He is even more shocked to learn that he is expected to marry Ophelia, a reportedly beautiful woman who he has never met.  Thanks to his half-Scottish ancestry, however, Duncan is determined that he will pick his own wife!<br />Sabrina is not a great beauty, but she has a gift for making others laugh.  Unfortunately for her, the little family scandal in her past is making the rounds of the London ton, and she'll have no chance of marriage there.  She lives with her two spinster aunts, and she doesn't really care if she becomes a spinster too - until she meets Duncan by chance.  The pair become fast friends, but there is so much working against them - will they ever be more than friends?<br />I liked this book, as I like all of the Lindsey books I have ever read.  As others mentioned, this book was bland compared with other Lindsey romances - when I picked up this book I was expecting a scorching romance that Lindsey so excellently authors on most occasions.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed in that regard - the book is very sweet, but there's little fire in the romance, even at the end.  <br />Still, not all was lost.  The book has other great qualities - I did like the main characters, Sabrina and Duncan, and I also greatly enjoyed the witty exchanges between Duncan and his friend Raphael Locke (I'd LOVE to read a book about Rafe!).  Lindsey is great at describing what the characters are feeling at particular times, and explaining why they do what they do, and I love that.  There was a lot of witty sparring in the book - Duncan and Rafe, the two spinster aunts, and the two grandfathers were all quick witted and funny.  The plot was good and moved along quickly, never becoming stagnant.  The book would have received five stars, in my opinion, except for the lack of passion in the book...it just didn't seem like a typical Johanna Lindsey book at all!  Other than that, though, I really did enjoy the book :)	2003-12-19
US	23595366	R297IBX4IQL9SX	0373835396	928905497	Four In Hand	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Four romances for the price of one!	The new Duke of Twyford had inherited more than his uncle's estates: he, the most notorious rake in London, had also become the guardian of four drop-dead gorgeous women, all of whom were determined to net a husband during the Season!  Twyford's duty was to secure suitable husbands for them - and yet he was irrevocably drawn to his oldest ward, Caroline.  It was completely improper for Twyford to attempt to seduce his own ward, but, as the most notorious rake in London, he could hardly allow the opportunity to pass him by!  As three other rakes also attempt to seduce the Twinning sisters, each rake soon learns that only one word, the most dreadful word in a rake's vocabulary, can get the Twinning sisters into their beds - marriage!<br />I was frequently confused when reading this book.  Not only were there the four Twinning sisters (Caroline, Bella, Sarah, and Lizzie) and their beaux, but there was also Amanda Crowbridge, the Jennings girl (don't remember her first name), who were both friends of the Twinnings, and Sir Ralph.  I found it difficult to remember who was pining away for whom, and which Twinning sister was which.  Besides being confused, it was also difficult to develop any of the secondary romance plots to any great detail in 300 pages.  I would have prefered it if the author would have devoted AT LEAST four different books (Amanda Crowbridge and the Jennings girl could have had their own books too!) to the Twinning sisters' exploits during their Season, rather than try to cram it all into one book, which left a lot of unanswered questions and too little background information.  For example, although the Twinnings' experiences in America were hinted at, for being such a pivotal time in their lives, their experiences were not described in any detail.<br />Still, I can't write off the book because I was thoroughly confused through about half of it.  The premise was good, and I did get a good laugh out of the antics of the sisters.  I also had a great laugh at the expense of the poor beaux who were attempting to seduce the sisters without the tangles of marriage!  The book is really good, just incredibly fast-paced and bare-bones when it comes to descriptions, previous histories, etc.	2003-12-15

In exchange for a much-sought after commission for her brother, Angela will pretend to be Lucius' fiancee to please his dying grandfather, of whom Angela is also quite fond.  To make the old earl happy in his final months (Angela initially rejects the commission for her brother), Angela agrees to carry off the charade with the intent of breaking off the engagement after the earl has passed on.  As Angela and Lucius grow to know one another, however, will they want to break off their engagement?<br />What can I say, I have a suddenly intense weakness for scarred heroes.  I therefore liked the character of Lucius, although I wish that he would just tear off his mask once in a while if not for anything more than dramatic effect!  Having never seen his wounds, I have no idea how horrible they might be, but as one reviewer mentioned, so many soldiers were returning with scars, missing limbs, etc, and non-combattants also had pock marks, missing teeth, etc.  Perhaps the mask was a reflection of his vanity - after all, he had been exceptionally handsome before Waterloo, and perhaps he did not want others to see how much he had changed in regards to looks.  Perhaps the mask was a way of escape - perhaps his soul was tortured enough inside to want to block out the world in any way possible, including putting on a mask.  I don't know, but the mask thing gave the book a mystery about it that I enjoyed.  I, for one, have no qualms about a heroine potentially falling in love with a masked man - it's rather dashing, in my opinion.  If the hero is masked, then the heroine has no choice but to fall in love with the person, rather than the looks!  :)<br />At any rate, I liked the character of Angela.  She wassweet and kind, although a bit too meek for my tastes.  Angela and Lucius went well together, sparring and all.  In his heart, Lucius wanted Angela to find happiness, even if that meant she didn't end up with him, and that was noble, if not frustrating to some extent.  For the last 50 pages, I really just felt like thwacking Lucius on the side of the head.  The story could have wrapped up 50 pages or so before it did, and I would have been happy, but there was yet another subplot to rear its not-so-attractive head.  Sometimes there felt as if there was too much going on at any particular time, as if additional subplots were thrown in to keep the story going.  <br />Nevertheless, I did enjoy this book greatly, so much so in fact that I stayed up late to finish the book because I couldn't bear to put it down!  Despite a few minor flaws, the plot was good, and I never get tired of another retelling of the classic Beauty and the Beast story, especially when it involves engaging characters such as Angela and Lucius.  This book earned four stars in my opinion, and a place on my &quot;keepers&quot; shelf!	2003-12-10

Pagan Penhurst is bored with life, that is until his friend Hazard Maitland wagered that he could find a woman who would not be won over by Pagan's charms.  The intended target: Scholastica Hornsby, an educated young woman who was determined to remain independent.  Scholastica seems immune to Pagan's flirtatious attention at first, but Pagan won't give up until he has won his wager!  <br />&quot;The Notorious Duke&quot; got off to a slow start, and I was about to put the book down, but half-way through the story started to pick up more.  My most favorite part of the story was the ending - of course, I won't give it away, but the last few lines of the story had me laughing out loud!  Unfortunately, most of the story was entirely too predictable, and I could almost imagine exactly how the story ended after reading the first five or so pages (and guess what, I was right!).  Still, the story was relatively short (around 100 pages) so it wasn't too bad.<br />&quot;Cupid Goes to Gretna&quot; by Deborah Hale was my favorite story of the three included in the book.  Ivy Greenwood convinces Oliver Lyte to pretend to run away to Gretna Green, a notorious spot in Scotland where English lovers ran away to elope, so Ivy's brother and Oliver's aunt will come after them together and hopefully get back together (the aunt and brother had been a couple, but for reasons unknown to us, had split before Ivy wanted to run away to Gretna).  <br />About halfway through the story, I realized that I had read Ivy's sister's story as a promotion elsewhere, so that helped a bit when they referenced Ivy's sister in the story.  Ivy and Oliver were witty and entertaining, but the story was really too short for a good development of their characters since most of the story was taken up by their false elopement to Gretna Green.  The story was also predictable to an extent.  The thing that bothered me the most about this story is the ending - there is no finality in the ending.  Perhaps the author intends to write another story as a conclusion, but I felt like I was left dangling after I finished reading the story.  Still, the story was funny and more interesting than the other two, in my opinion.<br />The last story included in the book is &quot;The Rake's Bride&quot; by Nicola Cornick.  Theodosia (Thea) Shaw was left in dire straits when her father died six months ago, leaving her in charge of the family with little money and no income.  Desperate, Thea agrees to marry an old friend, Bertie, who promises to take care of her debts.  Thea is unable to go through with the marriage of convenience, however, and ditches poor Bertie at the altar.  Meanwhile, Bertie's cousin Jack, the Marquis of Merlin, traveled to the church to stop the wedding.  When he runs into Thea, however, the sparks fly!<br />This story was entertaining, and the least predictable of the three stories in the book.  I didn't care much for Thea or Jack, although their sparring was quite amusing at times.  The ending was a bit strange, but by this time I was just relieved to be finishing the book.  <br />None of the stories in this book are particularly awe-inspiring, but then again they are short stories and do not have as many pages to flesh out the characters as full-length novels do.  None of the stories were excellent, but none of them were horrible, either.  Altogether, the stories were mediocre, and I could think of much worse ways to spend a rainy afternoon than reading this book.	2003-12-09

Fairy tales just don't happen in modern-day times, or at least practical Penny Doyle didn't think so. Penny's only concern was to earn enough money to build a pre-school in her mother's honor, a pre-school that would have been built already if she hadn't been charmed out of the money by a good-looking swindler. After being given an opportunity to work in El Zafir for a great wage, Penny is determined to follow her dreams - and not let any man stop her again, good-looking or not.<br />Prince Rafiq Hassan was more than surprised when he noticed that his new assistant was plain Penny Doyle. Despite her shapeless clothes, thick black glasses, and severe hairstyles, Rafiq finds himself intrigued by the innocent American woman in his employ. The prince, known as the family charmer and a bit of a rake, is determined to get to know his assistant better - but is he willing to learn how to love?<br />I loved Penny and Rafiq! Penny was witty and intelligent, and the teasing matches between Penny and Rafiq had me laughing so hard I almost had to put the book down! Rafiq is quite the charmer, but has a sensitive, romantic side as well, and he is everything one could hope for in a dashing sheik hero role. The whole book had a Cinderella feel to it, and some of the trademarks of the fairy tale were also used in this romance. &quot;Cinderella&quot; in this case, however, had much more pluck and backbone, which I thoroughly enjoyed. <br />What I loved best about this book is the development of the relationship and romance between Rafiq and Penny was examined. In some romance books, there is a lot of lust but no substance to a romance, and I always leave such books wondering how such a relationship would survive for decades. In this book, however, I saw how each character fell in love with the other, from Penny's first days in El Zafir to the ultimate conclusion of the book. Although there was some lingering looks and passionate kisses, much more of the book focused on their relationship - which I enjoyed.  I never understood why this book was entitled &quot;To Catch a Sheik;&quot; when I think of &quot;catching&quot; someone in a romantic sense, I think more about entrapping someone, and yet that was never Penny's objective.  <br />This book is the first in the Desert Brides trilogy. The other two books are also by Teresa Southwick and are called &quot;To Kiss a Sheik&quot; and &quot;To Wed a Sheik.&quot; I haven't read &quot;To Kiss a Sheik&quot; yet, but &quot;To Wed a Sheik&quot; is also a great book!	2003-12-09

Valentine Sinclair, the Earl of Dare, is a spy living a double life: for most of the time, he spends his time in London, pursuing the pleasures afforded to the upper echelon of British society.  At other times, however, the Earl travels over to France and garners intelligence through his intelligence network positioned in Napoleon-controlled France.  Unable to save an associate from a brutal, painful death, Val \\"saves\\" someone else instead: the beautiful Elizabeth Carstairs, the mistress of a French gambler who owns a gambling hell in London.  After winning Elizabeth in a hand of cards, Val takes her to his London townhouse, where he offers her shelter.<br />Elizabeth Carstairs, however, isn't clamoring for the Earl's attentions.  She protects herself from the harsh realities of life by wearing a carefully constructed mask of indifference and secrecy.  Once Val learns Elizabeth's secrets, can he ever see her as anything more than a Frenchman's mistress?<br />Although this is the first book in the Sinclair brides trilogy (the other two are Anne's Perfect Husband and Her Dearest Sin, both by Gayle Wilson), I read this book last, and I wasn't sure I would like it.  In the other two books, Val and Elizabeth appear as secondary characters, but he always seems to be a bit snobby, and I thought that I most likely would not like him as the main hero.  Wrong!  <br />It took me a while to get into this book, but after the first 50 pages went by, I was hooked!  I loved the character of Elizabeth, she was a wonderful, noble soul who still retained her elegance and poise even after the horrible life she had been forced into.  Val was dashing and actually sensitive and romantic (even though he was a real jerk in a few scenes), which surprised me to no end, but in a pleasantly shocking way!  The ending was quite heart-warming, and I was left with that \\"awwwww\\" that ends every good romance novel :)  <br />I gave the book four stars because it took a while to get me involved in thestory, and also because the double standard of the era is smacked in the reader's face quite a lot, which irked me.  I know that the double standard existed then, and to some extent still exists today, but I was angry that because Val had slept with a lot of women, he was a handsome rake (at the beginning of the book, for example, he was keeping a mistress in his other London home!), whereas when Elizabeth had slept with a lot of men, she was called a whore and treated as if she were trash.  That burned me.  Altogether, though, the book is quite good!<br />The book also introduces the character of Ian Sinclair, who is the hero in Anne's Perfect Husband.  Ian is one of my favorite romantic heroes ever, so I really enjoyed having him in the book.  So if you are looking for a good regency book, or even a good regency series (I can't get over how good Anne's Perfect Husband is!), pick up this book!	2003-12-07

After standing up her third prospective groom, Francesca has decided that she's staying single, no matter how her mother tries to push her into another marriage!  The third groom, however, has a step-brother who wants to serve up a little revenge to Francesca.  If Mark Felding, a photographer for the AP, has his way, Francesca will become engaged once more, except this time, SHE will be the one left at the altar!  <br />I loved the idea behind the book - if this had happened to our relatives (or heaven forbid, happened to us), who wouldn't fantasize about a little revenge?  I don't know anyone irl who would go THROUGH with it, but in the book, Mark was determined to try!  The thing that bothered me most about the book, however, was how Francesca just let her mother bowl her over and bully her into a decision as monumental as marriage.  You'd think after the first, or even the second time, around, she'd tell her mother that it was her life and she would live it the way she wanted and marry who she wanted, if she married at all.  I never liked Francesca, because she never really thought about the consequences of her actions, and she seemed like an airhead.  Personally, I would have liked it better if Mark really had ditched her at the altar ;)  <br />Nevertheless, I did get a few laughs out the book, and things all turned out happily in the end.  Still, the book warrants three stars only in my opinion, and I'm not keeping this book around.	2003-12-05

Now, he saw potential in the island, and began to buy up property and hotels.  Fiona, a sculptress who also lived on the island, was less than glad to see Lachlan returning to the island.  He had left long ago, and now that he was back, she can't get over how he had rejected the island she loved and how he had unknowingly broken her heart.  Lachlan, however, couldn't get Fiona out of his mind, and knew he had to have her!<br />I loved this book!  The sparring between Lachlan and Fiona is quite funny, and I made the mistake of drinking some water while reading the part about what the King of the Beach (Fiona's sculpture on the beach, which infuriates Lachlan) was holding.  The book just about got a shower as I laughed out loud!  :)  Fiona was a wonderful heroine: smart, devoted to her father (who died before the book took place), witty, and determined!  During the ultimate resolution at the end, I &quot;awwwed&quot; :)  If you are looking for a book that makes you laugh and leaves you with a good feeling once you are finished, I recommend this one!	2003-12-05

She didn't need to be bothered, didn't need companionship (except for phone calls from her sisters), and most certainly didn't need a man!  Stefan, a boisterous Russian immigrant and her new next-door neighbor, didn't seem to respect Paige's desire for peace!  He finds numerous reasons to spend time at Paige's house, and Paige takes pity on him because his English needs work and he has virtually no friends in the States.  Stefan wants to be more than friends, though!<br />I really liked the character of Stefan, because he was intelligent, funny, and cheerful.  He had me laughing numerous times, from his actions to draw Paige out of her shell, to his attempts to use American slang.  I also liked Paige, and I could certainly relate to her attempt to shut away her heart and to just live the rest of her life alone out of fear of hurting someone else, or being hurt herself.  The reason for her self-imposed isolation, however, was a let down and I had to wonder why in the world she had allowed this tragedy to prevent her from getting into adult relationships.  It seemed like just an excuse (and not a very good one at that), and I was wondering if there shouldn't be some deeper reason for self-imposed exile!  <br />A warning - the book is a bit dated.  Stefan (a physicist) was still dealing with the fallout from the Soviet collapse in the USSR, and although Russians are still dealing with the collapse, it's not like what was described in the book anymore.  Still, this book is a good one, and I'm keeping it! :)	2003-12-05

Kamal, the crown prince of El Zafir, will be taking the reins of power from his father soon, and to ensure the royal line, must produce an heir.  Before Kamal settles down to a sedate married life, he decides to have one last fling, and chooses Ali as his target!  Ali, a nurse from the United States, had been in El Zafir before, and Kamal had kissed her.  Despite the passion in the kiss, she had assumed she would be shortly engaged after she returned to the States, and so she turned down his offer of a job in the new El Zafir hospital.  Six months later, however, Ali was back, having been jilted by her doctor boyfriend for a &quot;better prospect.&quot;  Despite Ali's desire for the Crown Prince of El Zafir, she doesn't want just an affair - she wants love!<br />I've always had a fascination with the Middle East, so I love the setting.  Ali is a character I can sympathize with, and I can't help but feel a little sorry for her after being dumped by her former boyfriend.  I also liked the character of Kamal, he was everything you would expect - strong, loyal, regal without being domineering, and a bit aloof.  He's passionate, but controlled.  The secondary characters are good, and the sub-plot about Kamal's young sister, who is pregnant, unmarried, and causing a royal scandal in the process, is an involving one.  This book, pretty much, is just about all I look for in a contemporary romance - an exotic setting, engaging characters, and a plot that keeps me entertained.<br />This book is the last in a trilogy, so it's a good &quot;sequel&quot; book to the other two romances preceding it.  The lives of Kamal's two brothers, Rafiq and Fariq, are touched upon as well, but do not dominate the romance between Ali and Kamal (which is a good thing! :))	2003-12-05
US	23595366	R3QWWMKHX0DCVB	0373291418	463226903	Last Bride In Texas	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Not horrible, but a boring book	Miss Elizabeth Hill wanted nothing more than to live her life in a small Texas town in peace.  At age 27 she was a spinster, well beyond marrying age according to the townsfolk, and she'd be the very &quot;last bride in Texas.&quot;  Then, one day, as she went to the bank on a regular errand, her life changed forever.  Connor Wade was an enigmatic man who just happened to be at the right place at the right time.  When he saw a bank robbery taking place across the street, he jumped in and shot the robbers - saving Elizabeth's life.  His reward?  A punch to the stomach from Elizabeth for ruining her favorite shawl when he shot the robber threatening her life.  Connor stays on in town, helping Elizabeth convert her spacious home into a boarding house.  Can a handyman with secrets in his past convince Elizabeth that she can be a bride after all?<br />The premise of the book was good, and sounded interesting.  I found it difficult, however, to get into the book.  For one, I spent most of the book just wanting to shake some sense into Elizabeth.  She allowed the townspeople to run roughshod over her for no apparent reason, and it just drove me to distraction reading about how she'd take their scorn AGAIN and internalize it AGAIN.  I wished that she'd grow a backbone sometime in her life, but by the time she started to show some promise, I was already bored of her.  Connor was a more interesting character, especially since the secrets in his past remained hidden for quite some time and kept you guessing.  <br />The ultimate resolution at the end of the book was somewhat unrealistic, especially Connor's &quot;real&quot; reason for coming to town.  Quite frankly, after Connor's explanation of his presence in town, I was just wondering if he was trying to con her!  Too much drama was thrown into the last part of the book, with little drama in the beginning of the book.  It wasn't a horrible book, but I was bored through most of it.  I won't be reading it again.	2003-12-04

She believes that every person has one true love, and she has found her love, a co-worker named Brandon.  Brandon, however, is not too concerned about settling down, and in fact flirts with just about every girl he can!  Corrine decides that she needs to take action, and she announces that she's leaving Brandon - but, in reality, she is only leaving for two weeks on vacation to a beautiful tropical island.  Corrine's best friend, Matthew, tags along on the vacation, determined to show her that HE is her one true love, not Brandon.<br />At first, I thought this book had real potential.  I was really looking forward to the new Flipside line, as I like contemporary and witty romances.  I like to laugh when I'm reading a romance!  And although I did laugh a few times, most of the time I was wondering when the book was actually going to get good.  Unfortunately, it never really did.  Although Matthew is a great character - charming, funny, loyal, intelligent - he is in love with Corrine, a completely unlikeable character.  Most of the time, I just wanted to slap her, and I didn't root for her to get together with Matthew.  Quite frankly, I was hoping that Matthew would meet some nice girl on the island and leave Corrine in the dust (or, in this case, the sand).<br />I never saw what Matthew liked in Corrine.  To me, she was a childish brat who was prone to wild ideas and too much dramatics.  Her whole reasoning behind the &quot;one true love&quot; stance was just plain odd, and I never got into her melodramatic life.  I also never got what she saw in Brandon, or really WHY she had to cling to him, but of course, I could say the same thing about many of my girlfriends' men, too.  I did finish the book, with much relief (as I absolutely CANNOT start a book and then not finish it).  This book is going in the yardsale next spring!	2003-12-04
US	23595366	RH011III584A4	0373441789	440982858	Forget Prince Charming	Books	4	5	5	N	N	An okay read...	Haley is sick and tired of being cheated upon by her handsome boyfriends.  After discovering her last boyfriend steaming up his office with his secretary, Haley is ready to do something drastic - start dating only sweet, lovable geeks who surely won't break her heart.  As soon as she makes this vow, she runs into a handsome new neighbor - Rick, the owner of a small bike shop.  Despite Rick's interest in her, Haley is determined to rebuff all his attention, because Rick is a handsome prince charming type who will surely squash her heart like so many other handsome men have done.  Rick, however, is ready to break down Haley's stereotypes about handsome men!<br />The book was interesting, and there were some funny parts during Haley's geek hunting.  Although I could relate with Haley's heartache about being hurt again, I just didn't like it that she grouped all handsome men as heartbreakers.  Her stereotypes just rubbed me the wrong way, maybe it has to do with the fact that I have been stereotyped way too much in my life!  LOL  The geeks=happiness equation didn't work for me, either.  Other than that, though, I did find the book to be entertaining, although a few parts in the story lagged, and the ending was predictable.  Rick was an interesting character, although he had a tendency to jump to conclusions way too much for my tastes.  But, if you'd like to spend an afternoon rolling your eyes and laughing a bit inbetween, here's a good book for you!  :)	2003-12-04

After returning from the Peninsula Campaign with a scarred face and a pronounced limp, he is jilted by his shallow fiancee because he was ugly and nearly destitute, as his father had left him practically nothing.  Jack retreats to the home his father left him, content to drink away his life in the country.<br />His grandmother, however, is not content to see her grandson waste away his life in such a manner.  A feisty older lady, she learns that her godmother's daughter, Kate, is destitute and is nearly about the enter &quot;service&quot; as a maid.  She &quot;kidnaps&quot; Kate on the way to visit her grandson, and soon discovers that Kate is able to bring Jack out of his black mood because she has a temper that rivals Jack's!  Kate, who is determined to become a housekeeper because she believes she has no prospects of a respectable marriage because of an incident that happened during the war, becomes Jack's housekeeper (although Jack insists that she is NOT his housekeeper).<br />Jack and Kate are hilarious, especially since they were always at each other's throats and are constantly bickering.  There was little substance behind their relationship, however, in my opinion - there was a good deal of lust, and anger, and anger that led to lust, but little else (so if you're looking for a tender romance, you may want to pass on this book).  On the other hand, if you enjoy a good laugh, this book is excellent!  I could certainly identify with Kate, especially since I have a similar temper problem!  :)  I also liked the fact that the heroine was not a virgin, although the circumstances surrounding that were a little unrealistic.<br />The ending of the book was also unrealistic, from what I know of the era (and I must admit, that's not much), it would be highly unlikely for such a course of events to take place.  In the end, however, I think this book was a good one, and I especially loved the sparring that occurred among Jack, his grandmother, and Kate.  It's going on the keeper shelf!	2003-12-03

Sebastian Sinclair (nicknamed &quot;Sin&quot;) has always been known as impetuous and a little reckless when it comes to making choices, and when he meets a woman (Pilar) running away from her horrible guardian, he is quick to come to her defense.  Sin walks away from the encounter, but with a scar across his face that will always be a reminder of what happened.  When he chances upon Pilar at a party, he knows what he must do - get revenge against her cruel guardian, and steal her heart!<br />I must confess that I read this book primarily to see what happened to Anne and Ian from the second book in the Sinclair Brides Trilogy (Anne's Perfect Husband).  I was a bit disappointed in this book.  There is not much romance at all, and is mostly an adventure story with a few strands of romance wrapped in along the way.  I have no idea why or when Pilar falls in love with Sin, and I have no idea why or when Sin falls in love with Pilar, as their relationship is rarely discussed.  The plot was also a bit predictable, after reading about 30 pages of the book I knew exactly what was going to happen in the end.  It's an okay book, but doesn't have the bite that the first two books in the trilogy had, in my opinion.	2003-12-02

I usually don't go for Regency romances, I tend to prefer contemporary romances, but this book was incredible!  Ian Sinclair, a handsome war hero who is devoted to the principles of honor, comes back from war with potentially fatal wounds.  He discovers that he is now the legal guardian of a child he has never met, the daughter of the man whose actions nearly killed Ian.  Ian, however, does not wish to hold the father's shortcomings against the daughter, and travels to the rural school to take her to his home for the holiday season.  Ian is shocked to discover that his ward is no child, but a young woman who steals his heart.  Ever the gentleman, however, Ian could not bear to subject her to a life of anything less than perfection, and he knows he is hardly perfect.  He instead plans a Season for her, to introduce her to the eligble bachelors of London society.  When will he learn that he's Anne's perfect husband?<br />This book is almost perfect itself, and the characters are quite charming and realistic.  I wish that more attention had been spent on the events that occur in the last part of the book.  I also wish that some of the other themes had been emphasized - Anne's father's actions against Ian, for example, as well as the age gap between Anne and Ian (which seemed to be a slight problem in the beginning, but was not addressed at all in the remainder of the book).  Altogether, however, Ian is everything a romantic hero should be, if you go for those war-hardened, gentlemanly types (and I do!  WOOHOO!  ;))  An excellent book, and definitely a keeper.	2003-12-02

Will Tucker is the gruff owner of a ranch and realizes that his cooking just won't do.  He asks his city-living sister to get him a cook, expecting his sister to choose a stout, middle-aged widow for the job.  Instead, his sister sends Linnea, a small, fragile woman who looks like a strong wind will knock her over.  Will is determined to send her back to the city, but Linnea is equally determined to prove that she will be a good cook and companion to Will's step-mother, who lives with him.  Linnea, however, is hiding some secrets from her employer - secrets he is bound to find out sooner or later!<br />I enjoyed this book.  I took it with me on a trip and finished it in one day.  I even stayed up late at night so I could finish it!  Will and Linnea's romance was incredibly tender and believable, I have been in a situation like she had been in (sans &quot;the big secret&quot;), and I could surely sympathize with her.  Will, despite his gruff exterior, turns out to be a big softy.  The secondary characters, particularly Cimarron, were equally charming.  The book seemed neither hurried or lagging when it came to the plot, things meshed together quite well.  This is on my shelf of keepers!	2003-12-02
