There may be some truth in this idea.  The central character, Willy Loman, is a man who has worked hard for the same company for over thirty years. According to all the tenets of capitalism, his qualities of diligence and loyalty should have been a guarantee of success, and yet his life ends in failure when he is dismissed by his employers without a word of thanks. Arthur Miller is sometimes attacked by political conservatives on account of his left-wing opinions, but in my view such an attitude is misplaced, as he was generally better as a writer of human drama than as a political propagandist. \\"The Crucible\\", for example, remains a great play even today, worth reading or watching not as an attack on McCarthyism but as a powerful drama with the strong figure of John Proctor, a flawed but genuinely tragic hero, at its centre. Similarly, the human side of Willy Loman's downfall is much more interesting than any political lessons that might be drawn from it; the play concentrates far more on Willy's relationships with his family than it does on that with his boss Howard Wagner.<br /><br />Willy is a much weaker character than Proctor. He is the salesman of the play's title, a man in his early sixties, approaching retirement. Despite his long service, travelling from his New York base all over New England in the service of his employers, he has never enjoyed great success in his job. He is in financial difficulties, struggling to pay the mortgage on his house and the instalments on the consumer goods- refrigerator, vacuum cleaner, car- which were becoming popular in the forties but which represented a major commitment, even in middle class households. In order to make ends meet, he has taken to borrowing from his old friend Charley. His sense of failure, however, does not derive solely from his unsuccessful career. He also sees himself as having failed in his private life. Although his marriage to his loyal wife Linda has survived, despite the fact that he has on occasions been unfaithful to her, his relations with his two sons are strained. Biff, the elder, showed promise when young in both the academic and sporting fields, but failed to win a place at university after failing a maths exam at school, and since has become a rootless drifter, alternating between dead-end jobs and petty crime. Biff has been particularly alienated from his father since discovering one of Willy's affairs. Happy, the younger, has been more successful than Biff in his career, but in his private life is a selfish, cynical womaniser.<br /><br />Willy is a character much given to violent mood swings, alternating between exuberant over-optimism and despairing pessimism. The younger Willy's optimism was largely focussed on his own prospects, believing that he had a talent for making himself \\"well liked\\" which would lead to a brilliant career. The older Willy's hopes are mostly focussed on his sons, especially Biff, whom he still believes (in the teeth of all the evidence) to be capable of great things. When his son disappoints him, Willy turns on him fiercely, accusing him of being a \\"lazy bum\\". Biff's lack of success in life does indeed derive partly from his own weaknesses, but Willy's unrealistic expectations are also partly to blame. There may be a connection between Willy's job and his capacity for self-delusion. As Charley says of him \\"A salesman's got to dream. It comes with the territory\\".<br /><br />The play is written in two acts and a brief epilogue, but without any further formal divisions into scenes. On a number of occasions the action switches abruptly from the present into the past, as the characters act out episodes from earlier in Willy's life. Some of these episodes, in fact, may exist only in Willy's imagination, particularly those involving his older brother Ben, who is now dead although that does not prevent him from making several appearances. He seems to have been a wealthy man, although there are two versions of how he acquired his wealth, one involving business dealings in Alaska, the other diamond mining in Africa. Ben, in fact, is not really a character in his own right, but rather functions as a symbol of the failures and missed opportunities in Willy's life. This structure can make the play rather confusing when read from the printed page, but any confusion is generally quickly resolved in a well-directed stage or screen performance. (One particularly good filmed version is that starring Dustin Hoffman from 1985).<br /><br />There is much more to the play than a critique of the capitalist economy or of the American way of life. It is also a character study and an exploration of the relationships within a family, especially father-son relationships (which was also an important theme of Miller's \\"All My Sons\\"). On a wider level it touches on the plight of the elderly, especially those whom society no longer seems to value, on the human need, too often disappointed, to aspire to a better life, and on the gap between appearance and reality. It is a play that deserves the high reputation it has acquired since it was written in the late forties.oes not prevent him from making several appearances.

US	36348634	RDX1F01X1IIMP	0140481389	907196342	The Crucible (Penguin Plays)	Books	5	6	9	N	N	Forget the Politics; This is a Great Play	It is perhaps unfortunate that \\"The Crucible\\" has become so closely associated with McCarthyism. It  was, of course, the playwright's deliberate intention to use the Salem witch trials in order to attack McCarthy, and he succeeded in his intention to such an extent that it is today difficult for any historian to write about the proceedings of the House Un-American Activities Committee without using the phrase \\"witch hunt\\". Whether this has done the play's long-term reputation any good is another matter. McCarthyism may have been a burning issue in the fifties, but today, at least to anyone under the age of seventy, the HUAC seems nearly as remote in time as the witch trials themselves.  <br /> <br />Moreover, the parallels that Miller draws between Salem and McCarthyism are not, in my opinion, persuasive. Fear of Communism in the nineteen-fifties was not the equivalent of the fear of witches in the sixteen-nineties. Miller is never able to argue convincingly against the objection that the danger which the people of Salem feared- malevolent witches armed by the Devil with supernatural powers - was wholly illusory, whereas the danger from the hostile Stalinist dictatorship which confronted America in the Cold War was real. It is no answer to state that people (or at least some people) in the seventeenth century believed in witches; the fact remains that we today do not and that our view of the events at Salem is inevitably coloured by our disbelief. (If we did still believe in witches today, we would view those events in a very different light). The central moral question raised by McCarthyism was \\"How should a modern democracy protect itself against the adherents of anti-democratic totalitarian philosophies?\\" By setting his play in America's remote past, Miller avoids answering this question. Senator McCarthy was open to criticism on the grounds that his measures were not only unconstitutional (given that the Communist Party was never an illegal organisation) but also actually destructive of the very freedoms which they were ostensibly aimed at protecting. To criticise him, however, on the grounds of a fanciful comparison with the superstitions of the seventeenth century seems perverse.  <br /> <br />Why, then, given that I disagree fundamentally with the author's political position, have I awarded this play five stars? The reason is that it has become a play that has taken on a life of its own, independent of the political concerns that prompted it. We do not today worry ourselves greatly that Shakespeare's \\"Richard III\\" was originally written to demonstrate the legitimacy of the Tudor dynasty to which his patron Elizabeth I belonged, or that his \\"Macbeth\\" was written to ingratiate himself with her successor James I. We read those plays because they are two of the greatest tragedies in the English language. Similarly, we can read and enjoy \\"The Crucible\\" even if we disagree with Miller about McCarthyism, or even if we have never heard of McCarthy, because it is one of the greatest tragedies written in English in the twentieth century.  <br /> <br />The modern play which comes closest in theme to \\"The Crucible\\" is, in my view, Robert Bolt's \\"A Man for All Seasons\\", another play inspired by real historical events and which has as its hero a man who would rather forfeit his life than tell a lie. Bolt's Thomas More, however, is a somewhat idealised figure, whereas Miller's hero, John Proctor, is a classic flawed tragic hero, a man who becomes involved in the tragedy because of his human frailties. Proctor, a prosperous farmer, has been unfaithful to his wife Elizabeth with their maidservant, Abigail Williams, but has repented of his adulterous affair and, at his wife's request, has dismissed Abigail from his service.  <br /> <br />These events come back to haunt him. As the play begins, Abigail is the leading figure in a group girls and young women who begin to accuse their neighbours of witchcraft and who, in the prevailing climate of superstitious Puritanism, are readily believed by the authorities. Abigail, still obsessively in love with Proctor and consumed with hatred for his wife, accuses Elizabeth Proctor, who is arrested. Proctor's attempt to prove his wife's innocence backfires, and he is himself accused and sentenced to death. He is told that his life will be spared if he confesses; he therefore faces the dilemma of whether he should save his life by confessing to a crime he did not commit, or whether he should continue to maintain his innocence, which means that he will be hanged. Besides Proctor, there are a number of other memorable characters, such as the spiteful, hysterical and vindictive Abigail and Rebecca Nurse, an old woman in her seventies who maintains her dignity despite the absurd charges that are brought against her. <br /> <br />Paradoxically, the factors which make the play a failure as a political allegory are the ones that make it a success when seen as a human drama. Miller could, had he wished, have written a play which dealt with McCarthyism directly, just as Charlie Chaplin did in his film \\"A King in New York\\", but there would have been a risk that such a play would quickly have become dated. (Chaplin's film is all but unwatchable today). By setting his play in the past, and by concentrating on the human aspects of the Salem witch-trials, Miller has produced a timeless work which still speaks to us today, not as a satire on a long-dead American politician, but as a play about injustice and the struggle against it, and as a study of a man fighting to retain his integrity in a world gone mad.  <br />	2005-09-05

His first major independent work was as the designer of the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol (in the event not actually completed until after his death). He is, however, best remembered today for the role he played in revolutionising two modes of transport, railways and steamships. He was responsible for building the railway line from Bristol to London, at that time the longest railway ever built, and for continuing that line into the West Country to create the Great Western Railway. He was also the first man to realise that steam power could be used for ocean-going ships. It had previously been assumed that no ship could carry enough coal to power itself across an ocean; Brunel showed that this was a mistaken assumption and that by increasing the size of the ship it would be possible to create a vessel capable of crossing the Atlantic by steam. To prove his point he designed two ships, the \\"Great Western\\" and the \\"Great Britain\\", each larger than any steamship previously built, for that purpose. His final masterpiece, the \\"Great Eastern\\", was designed to make the much longer journey from Britain to Australia. This book details all these feats, as well as some of Brunel's less familiar achievements. I was not, for example, aware that he was responsible for designing a portable military hospital during the Crimean War.   <br /> <br />Rolt's book, which came out in 1957, was the first-ever full-length biography of Brunel apart from one written by his son Isambard junior in 1870. Rolt was clearly an admirer of Brunel, but I do not think that his attitude to his subject was one of uncritical hero-worship as one reviewer claims. He discusses Brunel's failures as well as his successes, such as his disastrous enthusiasm for the unworkable \\"atmospheric system\\" whereby trains would be propelled by atmospheric pressure rather than pulled by engines. Brunel was, surprisingly, not very successful when it came to designing the locomotives themselves; most of those used on the GWR were actually designed by his great friend and colleague Daniel Gooch. As for the \\"Gauge War\\", Rolt demonstrates that the seven-foot broad gauge, which Brunel championed and which survived on the GWR until the 1890s, was actually better terms of speed and power than the rival narrow gauge. The triumph of the latter was due not to any engineering considerations but to the vested interests of those railway companies that had already adopted it, largely because it was the gauge used by colliery railways in George Stephenson's native North-East.  <br /> <br />Viewers of a recent BBC television series voted Brunel the second-greatest Briton of all time, with only Churchill ahead of him. The reason why he is so revered today is that he was a great pioneer, a man ahead of his time who showed what was possible, often in the teeth of opposition from the scientific establishment of his day. (Rolt has great fun at the expense of \\"the egregious Dr Dionysius Lardner\\", a university professor who seemed to specialise in dire predictions of failure for all Brunel's projects, only to be proved wrong by events). The Great Eastern, for example, was a commercial failure as a passenger ship, but showed that it was possible to build iron ships on a massive scale, paving the way for the great liners of the early twentieth century. She also achieved success as a cable-laying vessel, laying the first transatlantic cable, something that Brunel had predicted but did not live to see. (Rolt does not discuss the theory that I have heard elsewhere, namely that the ship was far larger than she needed to be because Brunel had wrongly been informed that there were no coal deposits in Australia and that his ship would therefore need to carry coal for both the outward and the return journeys). It is perhaps therefore unfair to criticise Brunel for failure to keep to budgets and deadlines; it is far easier to produce accurate costings and time schedules for tried and tested procedures than it is when one is attempting something never attempted before.  <br /> <br />Rolt writes elegantly and fluently, and although he was himself from an engineering background, his book is clearly intended as much for the general reader as for the specialist. I would, however, have liked to have seen greater explanation of technical matters for the non-technical reader such as myself. Some diagrams and more illustrations would have been of great value in enabling me to appreciate the various mechanical innovations for which Brunel was responsible. My other criticism of the book is that I would have liked to have seen more information about Brunel's personal life; what there was seemed sketchy and based on conjecture. (Rolt, for example, leaves us with the impression that Brunel's marriage was not a happy one and that his wife Mary was a spoilt and superficial society beauty, without ever presenting much evidence to support these assumptions). Nevertheless I found the book an excellent introduction to the life and work of our greatest engineer.  <br />	2005-08-25
US	36348634	R1AQICDENJR09B	038082101X	694565872	Daughter of Fortune: A Novel	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Enjoyable HIstorical Adventure	This is a historical novel set in the Chile of the 1830s and 1840s and in the California of the Gold Rush era. The main character is Eliza Sommers, an orphaned foundling, who is adopted by Jeremy Sommers, the strictly moralistic representative in Valparaiso of the British Import and Export Company, and his sister Rose and brought up as an English lady in a foreign land. As a teenager, however, she falls in love with a young revolutionary named Joaquin Andieta, but he abandons both Eliza and his  revolutionary principles and leaves Chile for America hoping to make his fortune in the Gold Rush. Distraught, Eliza stows away on a ship in order to follow him to San Francisco, where she is befriended by Tao Ch'ien, a Chinese doctor.  <br /> <br />The book's main attraction for me was its unusual setting; nineteenth century Latin America not being a common background for a British readership. The Chilean scenes, which form the earlier part of the book, were the most interesting, giving a vivid picture of life in that country during the early Victorian period. Ms Allende was perhaps most at home writing about her own country. Although the author seemed to have researched the historical background, the Californian scenes were never quite as vivid as the Chilean ones, and some of the incidents in this part of the book seemed far-fetched. For example, in order to avoid being mistaken for a prostitute (the occupation of most of the women who made their way to Gold Rush California) Eliza disguises herself as a man, and even for a time passes herself off as Chinese, without her deception ever being discovered.  <br /> <br />I found that the weakest sections were those dealing with Tao Ch'ien's youth in China. When dealing with the Far East, Ms Allende's research seems to have let her down, as I spotted a number of errors. There was, for example, no such country as \\"Malaysia\\" in the nineteenth century; before independence from Britain in 1957 it was always known as Malaya. Confucius did not live \\"fifteen centuries before Christ\\"; he was born in or about 551 B.C., so Allende's estimate is inaccurate by nearly a thousand years. Chinese family names precede personal names, so the doctor should have been Ch'ien Tao (or Qian Dao in the pinyin system used to transliterate other Chinese words in the book) rather than Tao Ch'ien. The Chinese scenes refused to come to life, and the characters (apart from Tao Ch'ien himself) seemed more like stereotypes based upon Western preconceptions than individuals. Old men are sages imbued with the mystic wisdom of the Orient and Chinese women are gentle, submissive and know two hundred and twenty-two ways (a surprisingly precise figure) of pleasing their husbands sexually. Whereas Allende's Chile (and to a lesser extent her San Francisco) come across as real societies, her version of China seems more like a magical kingdom from a fairy-tale for adults.  <br /> <br />As with the settings, some of the characters in the book are more credible than the others. Both Eliza and Tao Ch'ien emerge as memorable individuals, but many of the minor figures do not. Joaquin, for example, is an insubstantial figure, a plot device for getting Eliza to San Francisco, rather than a believable character. Rose Sommers is a potentially interesting character, but Allende never really seems to have made up her mind as to how she should be portrayed. At times Rose seems like a prim Victorian spinster, at others as a beautiful and independent-minded young woman, and this inconsistency tended to undermine her credibility.  <br /> <br />One thing that does stand out is the description of social conditions in both Chile and California. Like her uncle, the late Chilean president Salvador Allende, the author's political sympathies are on the left, and this comes out in the passages about poverty in Victorian Chile and about the darker side of Gold Rush California; the frequent exploitation of the miners, the racism directed against blacks, Hispanics and Chinese, and even slavery. Although California was officially a free state, the authorities seem to have turned a blind eye to abuses such as Chinese women being forced into prostitution against their will. We are reminded that the Gold Rush was not simply an exciting chapter in the history of America's expansion westwards to the Pacific.  <br /> <br />Ms Allende is sometimes regarded as a member of the Latin American \\"magic realist\\" school of fiction, but I wonder whether it is really possible to categorise the literature of an entire continent in this way. Certainly, she occasionally makes use of the supernatural (Tao Ch'ien is visited by the ghost of his late wife), but book seemed closer to the traditional historical romance or adventure story than the sort of work we normally think of as \\"magic realism\\". It has both strengths and weaknesses, but is on the whole an enjoyable read. It lacks, however, the depth and significance found in the work of some of the author's Latin American contemporaries, such as Marquez and Llosa, to whom she is sometimes compared.   <br />	2005-08-15
US	36348634	R1HGFRAZSVZI03	B0006C08H2	20446308	A bouquet of barbed wire	Books	1	16	22	N	N	The Half-Hearted Pornographer	Most of Andrea Newman's works are now out of print, but during the late sixties and seventies she had the reputation of being the enfant terrible of British literary fiction. \\"A Bouquet of Barbed Wire\\" became her most controversial work after it was serialised on television in 1976. Many books, films and television programmes which were considered scandalously explicit during that period have since become part of the cultural mainstream, but this one, with its themes of incest and domestic violence, still seems shocking shock even today.  <br /> <br />The novel is reminiscent of the works of Newman's exact contemporary Margaret Drabble and her older contemporary Iris Murdoch in that it deals with the love lives of members of the prosperous middle classes of London and the Home Counties, although Newman seems to deal with her themes with a greater sexual frankness. At the centre of the book is a complex web of relationships between five main characters; Peter Manson, a well-to-do middle-aged publisher, his wife Cassie, their nineteen year old daughter Prue, Prue's American husband Gavin, and Sarah, Manson's secretary with whom he is having an affair.  <br /> <br />The most controversial element in the plot is that Manson's feelings for Prue go far beyond a normal father-daughter relationship, verging on incestuous desire. All the other plot developments flow from this. Manson does not dare to break the legal and social taboo against incest, and his affair with Sarah, a girl around Prue's age, can be seen as a sublimation of his feelings for his daughter. He resents Prue's marriage partly out of suspicion that Gavin will not prove a good husband, but also partly out of ill-concealed sexual jealousy. Prue discovers her father's affair, which she sees as a betrayal and informs her mother, leading to a separation between Manson and Cassie. In revenge, Cassie begins an affair with Gavin.  <br /> <br />Although this is a work which deals with strong emotions and sexual passions, Newman's style is cold and emotionally detached, as though she were trying to distance herself from her characters, who resemble pieces pushed around a chessboard more than they do living human beings. They never come to life and the motives for their actions often remain obscure. Particularly baffling are the relationships between Gavin and Cassie and Gavin and Prue. Manson's suspicions of Gavin's suitability as a husband prove well-founded, as he turns out to be violent and abusive, on one occasion beating his wife so badly that she has to be taken to hospital. His appalling treatment of her daughter, however, does not prevent Cassie from taking him to bed. Even more offensive is Newman's implication that Prue herself, motivated by masochistic tendencies, deliberately provokes Gavin's behaviour.  <br /> <br />Although this is not an overt piece of erotica, Newman's approach to sexual matters resembles that of the pornographer. Whereas the growing climate of liberalism enabled other writers of the period to make use of sexual frankness as a means for exploring the human psyche with greater honesty, for her it seems to have become an end in itself, or at most a means to win herself a reputation for controversy and thereby to achieve a succes de scandale. \\"A Bouquet of Barbed Wire\\" resembles a piece of half-hearted pornography, an erotic novel with the most erotic passages bowdlerised. I found it cold, pretentious and lacking in any insight into human relationships, more concerned to shock than to illuminate. Having read this book (the first I have reviewed which I have awarded only one star) it did not surprise me that Newman's reputation has declined so much since the seventies.  <br />	2005-07-22

The main character, Bjartur of Summerhouses, is a small independent crofter who takes his name from the holding he has purchased. In keeping with the book's title, Bjartur's independence is, in his own eyes, the most important thing about him. He is defiantly self-sufficient, proud of the fact that he calls no man his master and that he owes no man money, despite the fact that his life seems to be a succession of disasters. His first wife dies giving birth to a daughter, Asta Sollilja, who is not his. His second dies after a long illness. Several of his children are stillborn, one of his surviving sons disappears and another leaves him to emigrate to America. Bjartur expels the unmarried Asta Sollilja from his home after learning that she is pregnant with an illegitimate child. His sheep are hit by disease and  he fails to rise out of poverty. He prospers for a time during the First World War, when there is an increased demand for Iceland's agricultural produce, but this is only temporary, and after the war ends he sinks back into financial difficulties and gets into debt. In the end he is forced to abandon his hard-won and much-prized independence, and in order to pay off his debts sells his croft to his enemy, the aristocratic Bailiff of Myri.<br /><br />Besides the story of Bjartur, the novel also touches on the social and political development of Iceland during these years. The Bailiff's son, Ingolfur Arnarson, has assiduously promoted a farmers' cooperative movement, ostensibly with the aim of freeing them from dependence upon a handful of wealthy merchants, but really in order to further his own interests. The book ends with Arnarson Prime Minister of Iceland and most of the members of his cooperative scheme, including Bjartur, impoverished or ruined.<br /><br />Bjartur, who is very much at the centre of the novel, is an ambiguous character. On the one hand, his determination to succeed and stoicism in the face of misfortune can be seen as admirable characteristics. On the other hand, there is also criticism of him, and of those like him, on account of his stubbornness and excessive pride in his self-reliance. His independence is not only economic but also emotional; he seems emotionally detached from all around him, including his family.  The book can be seen as a critique of Bjartur's \\"independence\\" from two viewpoints, one political and the other psychological. Laxness seems to have been politically on the left, and Socialist ideas are introduced into the book near the end, when a strike takes place among Arnarson's workmen against their low wages. It is significant that the title of the work is plural- \\"Independent People\\"- rather than singular- \\"An Independent Man\\". Laxness's criticism of Bjartur's stubborn self-sufficiency may have been directed not simply at one fictitious individual but rather intended to have a relevance to Icelandic society as a whole. The political message is that Icelanders- particularly the Icelandic working class from which Bjartur stems- need to maintain solidarity and social cohesiveness which are being put at risk by the excessive pursuit of self-interest. Psychologically, the theme of the work is that \\"No man is an island\\". Those, like Bjartur, who attempt to live as one, will end up becoming isolated from their fellow-men.<br /><br />Laxness has been compared to Hardy, and there are certainly some similarities to the great English novelist's work in that \\"Independent People\\" makes use of the lives of the rural working class. A closer comparison, however, might be with the younger generation of British rural writers, such as Mary Webb and Sheila Kaye-Smith, who came after Hardy. There are close thematic links between \\"Independent People\\" and Kaye-Smith's \\"Sussex Gorse\\", another novel about a proud and independent-minded small farmer whose obsessive pursuit of wealth drives his wife into an early graveand alienates his family and children. The difference between the two works is that Kaye-Smith's protagonist, Reuben Backfield, is successful in material terms, although a failure in spiritual ones; the novel ends with him in a wealthy and complacent old age, having become the greatest landowner in the district. Whereas Laxness takes as his theme \\"No man is an island\\", the devoutly Christian Kaye-Smith takes as hers \\"What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul\\"? Backfield's tragedy is that he does not even realise that he has a soul to lose.<br /><br />Bjartur, however, seems too cold and detached to be the hero of a Hardy novel. Michael Henchard in \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\",  for example, might  be as stubborn and headstrong as Bjartur, but he is also an emotional man of strong passions; as a result it is easier for the reader to empathise with him. Henchard, like Tess, Jude and other Hardy heroes and heroines, can be seen as a tragic victim of fate, whereas Bjartur seems more like the victim of his own stupidity. \\"Independent People\\" also lacks the strong narrative drive of Hardy and his sense of the tragic. It is in many places ponderous and heavy-going. (I do not know Icelandic, so am unsure if that was the fault of Laxness or his translator). Although it is in many ways an interesting work, bringing to life a society in a remote part of Europe which is little-known in Britain, I did not really find it a very readable one.	2005-07-06

Janet, the central character of this novel, tries to keep a foot in both camps. On the one hand she is Janet Stockwell, the wife of a successful insurance company executive, on the other, she is Janet Belle Smith, moderately successful writer of short stories. (She writes under her maiden name).<br /><br />The novel is set during the two weeks in midsummer which Janet spends at Illyria, a New England stately home. (The story is told in the first person, and is written as though it were being told in Janet's diary). Once the mansion of a wealthy family, Illyria is now, under the terms of the will of its last owner, a colony for creative artists. The name \\"Illyria\\" is probably a pun on \\"Bohemia\\"- both were former names of counties in Eastern Europe, Croatia and the Czech Republic respectively, and both were used by Shakespeare as settings for plays. Every year, various writers, musicians, painters and sculptors are invited to spend a few weeks or months in the house in order to escape from the pressures of the outside world (what Janet calls \\"the world of telegrams and anger\\") and concentrate on their work.<br /><br />Among Janet's fellow-guests at Illyria are Charlie Baxter, a disillusioned Marxist novelist, now a self-destructive alcoholic suffering from poverty, Gerald Glass, a young hippy poet, Nick Donato, a modernist pop-art sculptor from a working-class immigrant New York background, and Leonard Zimmern, an eminent literary critic. The guest Janet is most looking forward to meeting is Kenneth Foster, a more traditionalist artist. Although there has never been any sexual relationship between them, Janet is secretly in love with Kenneth; he is trapped in an unhappy marriage to a drunken and unfaithful wife, and Janet sees him as a kindred spirit, someone who, unlike her husband, understands her creative impulses.<br /><br />Janet has always enjoyed her stays at Illyria in the past, and at first she is happy to be once again in a place she describes as a \\"small private Eden\\". (The title \\"Real People\\" derives from Janet's theory that at Illyria one becomes one's real self, the person one would be in a decent world). Even in Eden, however, there was a serpent and forbidden fruit, and as Janet's stay progresses she finds quarrels breaking out among the guests and she herself becomes more discontented. (The changing weather seems to reflect Janet's feelings; at first pleasantly warm, it later becomes oppressively hot, with a thunderstorm at the end coinciding with her emotional crisis).  The catalyst for much of the discontent is Anna May Mundy, the teenage niece of the administrator of the Illyria foundation. Anna May is an attractive but superficial girl, uninterested in art but fascinated by celebrity, and it is her flirtations with the male guests which are the cause of much of the dissension. The crisis for Janet comes when she discovers that Kenneth is secretly a homosexual, and she allows herself to be drawn into a brief sexual liaison with Nick.<br /><br />Although this is a short novel, of less than 150 pages, it is a profound one, partly a character-study of Janet and her housemates, partly an examination of the nature of artistic creativity. Janet's discoveries about Kenneth and about herself lead her to re-examine both her personal life and her art, yet she emerges stronger from this crisis. Paradoxically, her adultery with Nick strengthens her marriage, as she comes to appreciate her husband's good qualities and abandons her fantasies of leaving him. As far as her art is concerned, she is forced to confront the fact that there has hitherto been something dishonest about her fiction and that she has been too concerned to avoid writing anything that might upset her family to her middle-class neighbours. The book ends with Janet resolving towrite with greater honesty in future. \\"If nothing will survive of life besides what artists report of it, we have no right to report what we know to be lies\\".<br /><br />For all the high-mindedness of its closing line, this is not a heavy-going or sententious book. Alison Lurie has the talent of combining serious themes with both readability and the ability to draw vivid, and often satirical, pen-portraits, and \\"Real People\\" is a good example of this talent. The novel is, in fact, often comic, as the author satirises  the pretensions of various members of the American cultural establishment.

A Medieval Mystery	Books	4	6	7	N	N	A Revisionist Reinterpretation	I was rather surprised by the title of this book, as I had always assumed that Chaucer had died of natural causes and that it was mere coincidence that he died in the same year (1400) as his former patron, the deposed King Richard II. The book puts forward an alternative suggestion, namely that Chaucer's death may have been deliberate murder on the part of the new regime of King Henry IV.  <br /> <br />Despite its title, the parts of the book that I found most interesting did not deal directly with Chaucer at all but rather offered a revisionist reinterpretation of the reign of Richard II and of his downfall. Richard has generally been seen either (following Shakespeare) as an incompetent weakling or as a would-be despot whose ambitions to impose a tyrannical system of government were only thwarted by his overthrow. The picture we are presented with here is a very different one. Richard emerges as an enlightened philosopher-king, a patron of the arts and of literature (particularly literature written in English), an advocate of peace with France and a ruler who allowed his subjects a remarkable degree of freedom of speech and conscience by the standards of the day. He certainly aimed to create a strong, centralised monarchy, but in the fourteenth century this would not necessarily have been regarded as a bad thing, as the alternative would not have been a parliamentary democracy along modern lines but rather a continuation of the corrupt, self-serving and quarrelsome oligarchy of nobles and prelates who had misgoverned England during Richard's minority, provoking the Peasant's Revolt of 1381 and plunging the country into civil war several years later.  <br /> <br />The events of 1399, when Richard was overthrown and replaced by his cousin Henry, were therefore not a mere family quarrel, but rather an ideological counter-revolution. The chief ideologue of Henry's revolution was Thomas Arundel, a former Archbishop of Canterbury whom Richard had deprived of his position and exiled for treason. Arundel's agenda was not merely to regain his lost position but also to instigate a crackdown on heresy, a concept which he defined as including criticism of the church authorities as well as unorthodox theological teaching. The late fourteenth century had seen the development of the proto-Protestant movement known as Lollardism, which had combined attacks on Church corruption with denials of certain Catholic doctrines such as that of transubstantiation. In 1401 Henry and Arundel were responsible for the introduction of the statute De Haeretico Comburendo, which allowed the Church to burn heretics at the stake for the first time in English law. <br /> <br />Chaucer was one of the first great English satirists, and, as the authors point out, the most frequent target of his satire was the state of the Church during his lifetime. He had some sympathy with the Lollards- certainly sympathising with their criticisms of corrupt and venal churchmen, if not necessarily with all their theological positions. Several of the pen-portraits in the General Prologue to the Canterbury Tales- the Monk, the Friar, the Pardoner, the Summoner and so on- are of worldly or dishonest clergymen or Church officials. In contrast to them stands the idealised portrait of the genuinely devout Parson, whose poverty, honesty and devotion to God mean that he is everything that the clergy of the day should have been but all too frequently were not.  <br /> <br />Chaucer's writings would therefore have been most uncongenial to Arundel's new regime, and the authors succeed in establishing that there might have been people who had cause to wish Chaucer dead. That is not, however, the same as establishing that someone actually killed him. The latter chapters, in which the authors consider the possibility that he might have been murdered or that he might have died in prison in 1402 (rather than the traditionally accepted date of 1400) are long on speculation and short on facts. Moreover, possible arguments against the murder theory are never really considered. The strongest argument against seems to be that if Henry and Arundel had wanted Chaucer dead they could have achieved this by putting him on trial on trumped-up charges of treason or heresy, thus allowing his death to serve as a warning to other potential enemies of the regime. Now there may have been good reasons why they did not act in this way, but these reasons are never explored in any depth, beyond a brief statement that Chaucer was a prominent figure in court circles and it would not have been a good idea to make his disappearance spectacular. (In fact several courtiers more prominent than Chaucer, including peers of the realm, did meet a spectacular end at the hands of the regime). Moreover, if England's greatest poet really was murdered by a usurping king and an autocratic Archbishop, one wonders why no rumours of the deed survived to be resurrected by Yorkists seeking to discredit the Lancastrian dynasty during the Wars of the Roses or by Protestants seeking to discredit the Catholic church during the Reformation.  <br /> <br />The authors, however, describe their book as not so much a \\"whodunit\\" as a \\"wasitdunatall\\". They admit that we cannot arrive at any definite answers to the questions \\"Was Chaucer murdered?\\" and \\"If so, who was responsible?\\", but point out that sometimes even unanswerable questions can be worth asking. This book explores just such a question. It is written in relatively informal and colloquial language compared with most history books (on just one page I found \\"bite the bullet\\", \\"stump up\\" and \\"he wants his ego massaging\\"). Unlike some, however, I did not find this language irritating- indeed, it made the book an easy read, one aimed at the general reader rather than the specialist historian. The authors are to be congratulated on taking an obscure episode in English history and the works of a poet with a reputation for being \\"difficult\\" (largely because of the differences between his language and modern English) and using them as the basis for an interesting and original work.  <br />  <br />	2005-07-06

Whereas the earlier book, however, was set in a wintry New England, \\"The Nowhere City\\" takes place in sunny California. Paul Cattleman, a young university historian, accepts a job with a big corporation based in Los Angeles to write the company's history.<br /><br />One of the major themes of the book is cultural differences between America's East and West coasts. Paul and his wife Katherine are both Easterners, she from an upper-class New England family. At first they react to their change of scene in very different ways. Paul loves Los Angeles for its sunny climate and its relaxed lifestyle. Katherine, on the other hand, hates the city. This is partly because the atmospheric pollution aggravates her allergies, but mostly because she regards it as a cultural wasteland, the \\"nowhere city\\" of the book's title. Los Angeles, to her, appears to have no sense of history, to be a place living in \\"an eternal dizzying present\\", where the differences between the seasons, and even between day and night, are less distinct than they are in the north-east.<br /><br />The differences between the couple create tensions within their marriage. Paul begins an affair with a young waitress named Ceci and gets drawn into her circle of unconventional friends living in Venice Beach, at that time a centre for the beatnik community. (The book is set in the early sixties). This leads into another theme of the book, the way in which California became for Americans in the second half of the twentieth century what America in general had been for Europeans of earlier generations- a frontier, a place of refuge for those dissatisfied for one reason or another with life at home and seeking a better life elsewhere. The Los Angeles area was therefore a natural magnet for the beatnik and hippie movements. (This idea of California as \\"The Last Resort\\" was alsoto be the theme of the Eagles' song of that name; it is interesting that Lurie later borrowed the title for one of her own novels, although that book is set in Florida rather than California).<br /><br />Katherine, seeking something with which to occupy herself, finds work as a secretary at the University of California, where she too begins an affair with her boss, an academic psychiatrist who is the estranged husband of a glamorous Hollywood starlet named Glory Green. This leads to a complex emotional entanglement. Paul's affair with Ceci comes to an end; she knows full well that he is married, but cannot accept the idea that he is still having sexual relations with his wife. Paul is then seduced by Glory, who is seeking  revenge against her husband. Eventually, Paul finds himself falling out of love with the California lifestyle, especially after the company refuse to publish his history which shows them in too harsh a light, and decides to move back East to take up a teaching job at a prestigious New England college, a decision which provokes the ironic role-reversal of the book's ending.<br /><br />I can't agree with the earlier reviewer who said that you begin the book hating Katherine and sympathizing with Paul. My sympathies were with Katherine throughout. Paul is a selfish character who has always put his own needs before those of his wife; he bullies her into moving to California, and Ceci is by no means his first extra-marital affair. It seemed to me that the book was written from a subtly feminist viewpoint and can be interpreted as the story of how Katherine learns to stand up to, and say no to, her self-centred husband.<br /><br />As is normal in Lurie's work, the tone of the book, despite some serious themes, is relatively light, with plenty of satirical humour aimed at the characters' pretensions. The big Nutting Corporation like the social kudos of having a Harvard-educated historian of their payroll, but do not like it when he tells them some truthsthey do not want to hear. Dr Einsam the psychiatrist is so busy analysing life that he is unable to experience it. Glory and the film industry types who surround her are shown up as shallow, vain and insincere. (The satire on the Hollywood of the sixties reminded me of that in Joan Didion's \\"Play it as it Lays\\", although that book is darker and more serious in tone). The beatniks are childish, and more economically dependent than they like to think on the \\"square\\" society they despise. Although they see that society as intolerant and narrow-minded, the same could be said for their own system of values with its \\"them and us\\" mentality.<br /><br />At times I found some of this satire to be somewhat unfair. The beatnik and hippie movements may have had their hypocritical side, but at least their unconventionality and idealism did force Middle America to ask itself some difficult questions it might have preferred to avoid. And are there really no unpretentious or sincere people working in the entertainment industry? Nevertheless, the satirist's role is not to be fair-minded; satire that strains to see both sides of every question and nails its colours firmly to the fence is hardly worthy of the name. The theme of cultural differences between East Coast and West Coast America was perhaps less interesting to me, as an Englishman, than it would have been to an American readership. (It has always struck me, anyway, that the two coasts have more in common with each other than either does with America's interior heartland). Although this is not my favourite Alison Lurie book (I prefer some of her later books such as \\"Real People\\" and \\"The Truth about Lorin Jones\\" which have a greater depth and insight), \\"The Nowhere City\\"  is certainly an enjoyable read	2005-04-29
US	36348634	R16WFLSMXGC71F	0679772871	380732504	The Magic Mountain	Books	3	18	29	N	N	Six Thousand Feet Above Reality	Hans Castorp, a young, newly qualified engineer arrives at the Berghof, a sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps, in order to visit his cousin Joachim, a patient in that institution. Hans intends to spend only three weeks there before returning to his home in Hamburg to take up a position with his family's shipbuilding firm. During his stay, however, Hans is himself diagnosed with tuberculosis and is admitted as a patient. He eventually stays in the sanatorium for seven years.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Although there are some genuinely serious cases, many of the patients, including Hans himself, are not seriously ill. Their most pressing concern is how to occupy their time; lacking any productive employment they have to find various pastimes. One of the favourites is engaging in philosophical debate; much of the book is taken up with the details of Hans's conversations with two men with radically differing views, Ludovico Settembrini and Leo Naphta. Settembrini is a man of the Enlightenment, a free-thinking liberal republican. Naphta, by contrast, despises the Enlightenment and all it stands for, advocating an ideology that combines obscurantist Catholicism with Communism. That mixture is perhaps less strange than it sounds; Mann perceptively  realised that Communism, despite Marx's insistence that it was a materialistic philosophy, had by the early twentieth century started to take on many of the characteristics of an exclusivist religious sect.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Hans is a largely passive young man; he listens avidly to the debates between Naphta and Settembrini but takes little part in them. There are hints that his lengthy stay in the sanatorium may owe more to his passive nature than to any genuine illness, as he prefers the gentle, if uneventful, routine of the Berghof to the more active life he would lead if he were to return to his family business. There is perhaps also a suggestion of collusion between him and his doctors, who have a financial incentive to diagnose patients as being ill and in need of treatment on dubious grounds. Although Hans finds hobbies such as botany and skiing to occupy himself, his one great passion is his love for a fellow-patient, Clavdia Chauchat, a married Russian woman. Clavdia's main attraction for Hans seems to be that she reminds him of another boy on whom he had a brief homosexual crush during his schooldays. Hans's passion for Clavdia, however, (like his earlier one for his schoolmate) is fated to remain largely platonic; indeed, for much of the time he does not even speak to her. Another important character is Clavdia's lover, Pieter Peeperkorn, only introduced near the end of the novel. He is presented as a Dionysian figure, determined to enjoy life's sensual pleasures to the full, as opposed to the more Apollonian, intellectual figures of Settembrini and Naphta.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The novel is set in the years immediately preceding the First World War, and one theory that I have heard is that the sanatorium is a microcosm of Europe during those years and that the sickness of its inhabitants is symbolic of the moral and political sickness that led to the war. Although the patients are indeed drawn from various European countries, and although there would have been an obvious temptation for anyone writing from the viewpoint of the 1920s (as Mann was) to analyse the Edwardian era in that way, I did not find the book to be a political work of that sort. It is a \\"novel of ideas\\", but only in the sense that ideas are endlessly debated between the characters. Settembrini and Naphta put forward their ideas about politics, but no attempt is made to tie these in with the wider European political situation or, indeed, any aspect of life on the \\"flat land\\", as the sanatorium's inmates refer to the world outside.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />This was, I felt, the novel's major weakness. I have always been of the opinion that novels of ideas, particularly political ideas, should exemplify the points under discussion by reference to the plot or to the situation in which the characters find themselves, but here there is little plot in the conventional sense. (To my mind, \\"Dr Zhivago\\", for example, is a much better political novel than \\"The Magic Mountain\\".) Like the Swiss mountain air, the atmosphere of the book is too rarefied.  Ideas are discussed, but in a vacuum away from the real world. Politics is not something that affects people's lives, but rather a set of abstract propositions for discussion among a group of acquaintances intent on putting to rights a world from which they have withdrawn. Clergymen are sometimes said to preach from a pulpit six feet above criticism; Mann's characters seem to be preaching six thousand feet above reality.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Other ideas are discussed in a similarly detached way. There is, for example, much talk of love, but few of the characters, with the exception of Peeperkorn, have any serious romantic interest in their lives. Even Hans and Clavdia only seem to be playing at love. Mann has some interesting theories about the subjective nature of time, but it is difficult to make these into the basis for a lengthy seven hundred page novel. Mann was a highly gifted writer (I have greatly enjoyed the other works of his that I have read, such as \\"Buddenbrooks\\", \\"Death in Venice\\" and \\"The Confessions of the Confidence Trickster Felix Krull), but \\"The Magic Mountain\\", which always seemed rather cold and unreal, was something of a disappointment to me <br />	2005-04-22

I have never, in fact, read a novel which has this precise combination of geographical location and subject-matter, but \\"A Long Walk in Wintertime\\", which is about adultery and is set in the neighbouring North London district of Camden, comes close. Daniel McDonald, a lecturer in philosophy at London University, has a brief affair with Lisha, a nineteen-year-old student. Daniel hopes to keep the affair secret, but when Lisha's parents learn that their daughter has had an abortion they write to the University authorities to complain about his behaviour. Faced with losing his job, Daniel is forced to confess to his wife Alice. He resigns from his position and takes a new job at the University of East Anglia, leaving the family home in London to live in lodgings in Norwich. <br /> <br />Unlike many studies of adultery, the book concentrates less on the adulterous affair itself than on the effect that it has on Daniel's family; the relationship is already over when the story opens, and Lisha only plays a minor part in the ensuing developments. Alice, who has lost her own job at around the same time, is left wondering whether she can forgive her husband. The person who seems to have been most deeply affected, however, is their twelve-year old son, Jamie. Already unhappy at his comprehensive school where he is doing badly, Jamie is upset by the separation between his parents and goes missing while on a train journey to visit his father.  Most of the rest of the book is concerned with Alice's search for him in the bleak Norfolk countryside.  <br /> <br />Perhaps unusually for a novel of the nineties, there is a strongly Christian (often specifically Catholic) atmosphere. One of the most important characters is Daniel's godmother Violet, a devout Catholic, and there is a sub-plot involving Violet's friendship with Geoffrey, a retired Army officer, with whom as a young woman she had a wartime affair despite the fact that he was married at the time. The themes of forgiveness, of making amends for past wrongs, particularly sexual wrongdoing, and of reconciliation are present throughout. In the book's opening scene, Alice and Daniel visit the opera; it is significant that the work they choose to see, Verdi's \\"Stiffelio\\", is about a husband who forgives his unfaithful wife. There is an attempt to contrast Catholic and Protestant attitudes to forgiveness; in Ms Purves's thesis, Catholicism places more stress upon release from guilt through confession, whereas Protestantism, at least in its evangelical form, is more concerned with making amends for the harm one has caused. It must be said that the plot itself does not always support this analysis; the Catholic Violet, for example, finds it difficult to forgive herself for her past sins, despite presumably having confessed them and received absolution.   <br /> <br />The novel is critical of certain aspects of modern British society, particularly the education of the young. Although Jamie is not academically gifted, he has strong artistic talents which his school has failed to recognise. (There is a contrast with his older and more confident sister Clementine, who attends an independent boarding school which is able to nurture both her academic and her sporting talents). During his wanderings in Norfolk, Jamie comes across a traditional steam-driven travelling funfair and, through a misunderstanding, is allowed to help with the task of repainting the horses on the merry-go-round, a task which enables him to make use of his artistic and creative gifts. It seemed to me that Ms Purves was challenging the British state school system to abandon its central ideal of a grammar-school academic education for every child and to do what many independent schools have done, namely to acknowledge that some children's talents lie in different directions. The funfair also acts as a symbol of an idealised past, a past wherechildren's entertainment was more innocent than it is today. The innocent thrills of the funfair are contrasted with modern computer games, obsessed with violence and death. Jamie has been playing truant from school in order to take part in a war game called \\"Battlezone\\", which involves the use of laser guns to kill imaginary enemies.  <br /> <br />Although her view of the past seems a rather conservative one, Ms Purves tries to take the standard politically correct liberal line on matters such as feminism and homosexuality. I say \\"tries to take\\" because she is not always convincing in these areas. One of the weaknesses of the book is the way in which the minor characters are often seen in stereotypical terms.  We might conclude, for example, from Alice's gay friends Simon and Stevie that gays are warm-hearted, spontaneous, creative, artistic and sensitive but also over-emotional, effeminate and (in Simon's case) wildly promiscuous. Quite. To complete this seventies sitcom picture, they even address people by such terms of endearment as \\"sweetie\\" or \\"ducky\\". (Ducky? I thought that one died with the Carry On films). Alice's other close friends are a snobbish, upwardly-mobile couple and Yasmin, a ruthless and embittered career woman with no time for serous relationships or family life. Yasmin comes across as so unpleasant that I was surprised that she was the best friend of anyone, let alone of a woman as different from her as the artistic, bohemian Alice.  <br /> <br />The title \\"A Long Walk in Wintertime\\" is perhaps misleading, for two reasons. First, the action actually takes place in autumn rather than winter. More importantly, the title tends to suggest a book that is both leisurely and sombre, but in fact the narrative moves at a brisk pace, and the tone, particularly of the ending, is optimistic. Despite its weaknesses, this is an interesting, if unfashionable, attempt to analyse modern family life in Christian terms.	2005-02-19
US	36348634	R36VP6UFAGJ4F3	014017737X	779170984	The Pearl	Books	5	8	10	N	N	The Song of the Family	The novella, midway in length between the novel and the short story, was a popular literary form in 19th-century Germany, where the writer and critic Paul Heyse put forward what he called the \\"Falkentheorie\\", or \\"falcon theory\\". Heyse's idea was that each novella should be distinguishable from others through a specific image, a physical object that not only played an important role in the story but which also had a symbolic meaning. (The name is taken from a story by Boccaccio which features a falcon).  Steinbeck's \\"The Pearl\\" is a good English-language example of a novella in Heyse's sense.  <br /> <br />The story is set in the Mexican city of La Paz in southern Baja California, once famous for pearl fishing. A poor fisherman, Kino, finds a huge and valuable pearl, and dreams that it will bring him a better life. The town's pearl buyers, however, are part of a corrupt cartel, and will only offer him a price much less than its true value. A gang attempts to rob Kino of the pearl, and he is forced to kill a man in self-defence. Kino and his wife Juana flee into the mountains, hoping to make their way to Mexico City, but they are followed by those who would steal the pearl from them, and their story ends in tragedy. It ends with a disillusioned Kino throwing the pearl back into the sea.  <br /> <br />The pearl is not only the object at the centre of the story, but is also a symbolic image. Its symbolism is twofold. On the one hand, it represents the aspirations of Kino and Juana towards a better life. Their hopes are comparatively modest- they do not dream of a life of luxury, but rather of new clothes, a hunting rifle, a church wedding (the local church denies the sacrament of marriage to those unable to pay for it) and, most importantly, an education for their young son Coyotito. Kino, significantly named after the great philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas, may be illiterate, but he has a great respect for learning.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, the pearl also represents evil in the world, symbolising the sins of envy and avarice. Kino hopes that the pearl will change his life for the better, but it changes it for the worse. Wealth is not an unqualified benefit; riches are likely to provoke greed and jealousy in others, and may also corrupt the character of those who possess them. The wealthy characters in the story are all shown in an unflattering light- the pearl buyers, the hypocritical and mercenary doctor, who refuses to treat Coyotito for a scorpion-sting while the family are poor but is happy to do so when he believes they have become rich, and the priest, who cares more for the financial welfare of the church than he does for the spiritual welfare of his parishioners. The men who pursue Kino and try to rob him are vague, shadowy figures, but Steinbeck leaves us in little doubt that they are in the pay of the rich of the city. It is not his poor neighbours who resent Kino's good fortune, but rather the rich, European-descended citizens. These men despise him for two reasons, because he is poor and because he is an Indian, and cannot bear the idea that a stroke of fortune might bring him wealth. Even Kino himself becomes stubborn, and insists on keeping the pearl when Juana wishes to get rid of it for fear that it will bring further misfortune. <br /> <br />A frequent image in the book is that of music. Kino experiences the world in terms of songs- not those written by others, but what Steinbeck calls \\"personal songs\\" in his head. When he is content with his life with Juana and Coyotito, he hears what is referred to as \\"the song of the family\\". When, however, the family unit is threatened, by the scorpion or by the robbers, he hears another song, \\"the song of the enemy\\". There is a third melody running through the book, the \\"song of the pearl\\", which may harmonise with either the song of the family or with that of the enemy, depending upon whether the pearl is seen as a blessing or a curse.  <br /> <br />Contrary to what some have stated, the book is not set in Mexico's distant, colonial past, but in the twentieth century. (This is made clear by references to the four centuries since the Spanish conquest, which occurred in the 1520s). Whether or not it is actually based upon a folk-tale, it is certainly reminiscent of one in style- unsurprisingly, as Steinbeck was deliberately aiming for this effect. The story is told simply, in a limpid prose with relatively short sentences. Although it is a short book of less than a hundred pages, it is not simply a terse recounting of the story; Steinbeck still finds space for some fine, poetic passages of descriptive writing, capturing the vivid colours and hazy light of the coastal landscapes of the Gulf of California. \\"The Pearl\\" is both the particular, and deeply moving, story of two young people and a symbolic fable with a wider human significance. Writing about this book, the English writer Richard Church stated that Steinbeck showed \\"that simplicity of spirit which is the most distinguished feature of a true poet\\".  <br />	2005-02-07
US	36348634	R1ENDT4C37E65D	0394757602	877332594	The Enigma of Arrival	Books	3	13	13	N	N	One to Read in Winter	The title of \\"The Enigma of Arrival\\" is borrowed from a mysterious, haunting picture by Giorgio de Chirico, and the novel is as enigmatic as the painting from which it takes its name. It is not a conventional novel; in many ways its tone is closer to that of an autobiography than to that of a work of fiction. The narrator, like Naipaul himself, is a Trinidadian of Indian ancestry who arrived in Britain in the early fifties to study English at Oxford University and with an ambition to become a writer. The greater part of the work is taken up with a description of three years spent by the narrator living in a cottage in a small village in Wiltshire, probably during the seventies.  <br /> <br />There is no plot in the normal sense of the word, and little in the way of characterisation, although Naipaul does give sketches of some of the individuals he came to know during his time in the village. The most impressive aspect of the book is Naipaul's descriptions of his country walks, giving detailed accounts of the downland, farmland and water-meadows of Wiltshire in beautifully descriptive prose. Being a keen country walker myself, I marvelled at the author's powers not only of description but also of observation, as he brings the English countryside in all its moods to life with a vividness to rival such masters of descriptive writing as Thomas Hardy and H.E. Bates. There is also a strong sense of England's historic past.  Unlike some of those who have reviewed the book, I did not find these accounts boring. The book is slow moving, certainly, but that is not, in this case, a fault; it is a book to be read slowly, to linger over.  <br /> <br />The overall tone of the book is one of melancholy and disenchantment. Naipaul's aim in his descriptions of the countryside is not simply to celebrate its beauty.  He frequently describes it in its more sombre moods; many of his walks seem to take place on cold or overcast days. He has a good eye for prosaic details- barbed wire, derelict buildings, farm machinery. A theme that runs throughout is that of exile. The narrator (who is clearly intended to be identified with Naipaul himself) is, in a sense, a double exile. For all his love of the countryside, he is an outsider in England, a voluntary exile from the land where he was born. He feels like an exile in Trinidad, however, aware that his family are exiled from India, their ancestral homeland.  <br /> <br />In an sense, many of the English people whom the narrator meets are also exiles, although not, of course, in a geographical sense. They are exiles in the sense that they find themselves alienated or left behind by social change, like the narrator's landlord,  an aristocratic figure from a once wealthy family which has come down in the world. The less wealthy among the villagers also find themselves affected by the changing social order, and many of them are unhappy, dissatisfied or disaffected.  <br /> <br />Perhaps my main criticism of \\"The Enigma of Arrival\\" would be one originally made by Salman Rushdie, namely that it is \\"devoid of either passion or love\\". The narrator is as disillusioned as any of those people about whom he writes, perhaps more so, without any room for enthusiasm or joy in his life. He appears to be a childless bachelor, without any romantic attachments or even close friendships. The result is a bleak book, but still a fascinating one. One to be read in winter.	2005-01-21

A spirit of revolt grows among the animals, inspired by Major, the old boar, who develops a philosophy known as \\"Animalism\\", which urges animals to revolt against their human masters, to take control of the agricultural system and to run it in their own interests. After Major's death the animals seize their chance to rebel against Jones and succeed in ousting him and taking control of the farm, which they rename Animal Farm. The leading role is taken by the pigs, portrayed as the most intelligent of the animals, and after the success of the  revolution a power-struggle breaks out between two of their number, Napoleon and Snowball. With the aid of a trained pack of dogs, Napoleon banishes Snowball from the farm and makes himself a barnyard dictator. From then on, the farm is run in the interests of Napoleon and the pigs. One by one, the principles of Animalism are abandoned and the other animals are treated as badly by the pigs as they were by Jones.<br /><br />Orwell intended the book as a satirical allegory of the Russian Revolution and of the way in which Communism had developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin. Major personifies Marx, Snowball Trotsky, Napoleon Stalin and Jones the Tsar. Other animals on the farm stand not for individual historical figures but for types- for example the simple-minded but strong and good-hearted horse Boxer stands for that section of the Soviet working class which continued to support Communism wholeheartedly even during the Stalinist era. The dogs represent the security apparatus of the Red Army and NKVD, the pig Squealer the propaganda system, the mare Mollie who deserts Animal Farm the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; community, and so on. The allegory is somewhat simplified- there is, for example, no character precisely equivalent to Lenin- but most of the main developments in Soviet history have their equivalents in the book- the revolution, the Stalin-Trotsky split, the Five Year Plans (symbolised by the building of a windmill), the purges, the Nazi-Soviet Pact and the German invasion of 1941.<br /><br />Orwell wrote the book in the winter of 1943/44, at the height of the Second World War. To criticise Russia in Britain at this point in history took courage, as there was a consensus on both Left and Right of the political spectrum that Stalin was our gallant ally; many on the Left  still clung to the illusion that the Soviet Union was a utopian workers' paradise, while the Right regarded criticism of a British ally during wartime as unpatriotic. Orwell himself was politically on the Left, but he had become disillusioned not only with Stalinism but also with what he called \\"violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people\\"; such a revolution could only lead to the people exchanging one despotism for another.<br /><br />Orwell not only satirised the history of the Soviet Union up to 1943, he also used the book in order to predict the way in which the Soviet system might develop in future. He correctly predicted that the Soviets would defeat Nazi Germany (represented by the vicious farmer Frederick). The book ends with the pigs becoming indistinguishable from the humans who still run the other farms in the district; this can be taken as a prediction that Stalinist Communism would inevitably end by reverting to a capitalist system indistinguishable from that prevailing in the West. When he wrote \\"1984\\" a few years later, however, he seems to have changed this view, because the system over which Big Brother presides is not capitalism but what Orwell called \\"Oligarchical Collectivism\\". Although Orwell continued to believe in democratic Socialism, it seems that by the time \\"1984\\"was published he no longer believed that Socialism and democracy were indivisible, but rather that it was possible to sustain a totalitarian system in which property would nominally be owned collectively but would be controlled in the interests of an elite group of Party leaders.<br /><br />A few years after Orwell's death, \\"Animal Farm\\" was made into a cartoon. Although the film was a success, it was criticised for reversing Orwell's ending by having the other animals rise up against their pig masters. During the Cold War, an implied prediction that Soviet Communism would ultimately be overthrown was obviously a popular message in the West. So who was right, Orwell or the film-makers? In a way, both were. As far as post-Stalin Russia was concerned, the film-makers appear to have got it right. The Soviet Union and its satellites never re-introduced Western-style capitalism, but remained collectivist oligarchies until the system collapsed in the late eighties and early nineties. As for the other Communist superpower, however, Orwell's prediction was spot-on, even though Mao's regime did not exist when \\"Animal Farm\\" was written. In recent years China has transformed itself from a Marxist dictatorship into a capitalist one without a revolution or even a change in the name of the ruling party.<br /><br />Orwell himself described the book as \\"a fairy story\\". It is very brief, a novella rather than a novel, and is told in a deceptively simple style. It can, in fact, be enjoyed by children who know little or nothing about Russian history, but it is clearly more than a children's story about animals. It is, in fact, in my view, the most devastating piece of political satire in twentieth-century English literature. By showing that even the most brutal dictatorships have something ridiculous about their pretensions, Orwell did for Stalin what Charlie Chaplin did for Hitler. Since \\"Animal Farm\\" it has no longer been possible to see Stalin as a heroic revolutionary leader, or even as a grandiose figure of heroic evil, like Milton's Satan. He was simply the biggest pig in the barnyard.erty would nominally be owned collectively but would be controlled in the interests of an elite group of Party leaders.  <br /> <br />A few years after Orwell's death, \\"Animal Farm\\" was made into a cartoon.

The body is believed to be that of John Harmon, the heir to a fortune amassed by his eccentric and miserly father, a \\"dustman\\" or refuse contractor. (In the 19th century, the word \\"dust\\" was often used in the sense of waste or refuse). Old Harmon had left his fortune to his son on condition that he should marry a young woman named Bella Wilfer, although there is no reason for this condition other than the old man's eccentric perversity. Upon the announcement of young Harmon's death, the money passes under the terms of the will to Nicodemus Boffin, a trusted employee of the old man, who adopts Bella as his ward.<br /><br />Unlike some of Dickens's other novels, such as \\"Oliver Twist\\", \\"David Copperfield\\" or \\"Great Expectations\\", \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" does not have a single principal character at its centre. It has three main plots. Two of these are love stories. Bella is loved by John Rokesmith, the mysterious young man who finds employment as Boffin's secretary. The spoilt and mercenary Bella (Dickens may have chosen her surname because of its closeness to the word \\"wilful\\") initially rejects him as being too poor, but later comes to appreciate his good qualities. The other love story concerns Lizzie Hexam, a poor working-class girl who, with her father, finds the body in the Thames. Lizzie has two men contending for her affections, a young barrister named Eugene Wrayburn and an obsessive schoolteacher named Bradley Headstone. The third main plot concerns an attempt by a dishonest acquaintance named Silas Wegg to blackmail Boffin and defraud him of his wealth.<br /><br />The method of publishing novels in monthly parts doubtless made economic sense in the 19th century, but artistically its effects were less beneficial. It tended to result in books which were overlong and which bore all the hallmarks of having been written in a hurry. \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" seems to have suffered from this more than many of Dickens's other novels. Many passages- even whole scenes- seem to have been inserted for no other reason than that Dickens needed to write a few extra pages in order to meet his monthly quota by the deadline for publication. The attempts at humour often fall rather flat and are not well-integrated into the rest of the book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is still a powerful work. Dickens's main theme (as in some of his other works) is money, and its power to corrupt both those who possess it (such as old Harmon) and those who aspire to it (such as Wegg). Money is associated with images of waste and decay; old Harmon's fortune, which Wegg hopes to acquire, is based on the fact that he possesses large amounts of other people's rubbish. At a lower level, Lizzie's father Gaffer Hexam earns his living (albeit a meagre one) as a \\"dredgerman\\", one who salvages flotsam from the river. As the Thames was notoriously polluted during Dickens's lifetime, this can hardly have been a pleasant occupation.<br /><br />Even when money is not literally earned from dirt, it can still come from morally polluted sources or have corrupting effects. Dickens has some sharp comments to make about grasping usurers and corrupt financiers such as Fascination Fledgeby and about the frantic mania for investing in shares which swept Britain in the 1860s. This seems to be a permanent feature of our economic system; Dickens could just as easily have been describing the speculation boom of the Twenties which preceded the Wall Street crash and the Great Depression, or the \\"Greed is Good\\" mentality of the Eighties, or the more recent \\"dot com\\" bubble. The sleazy nouveau-riche politician Hamilton Veneering is also a figure instantly recognisable to modern eyes. Even worse, in Dickens's view, was the callousness of many wealthy people of his day towards the poor; as in other novels such as \\"Oliver Twist\\" he attacks the Poor Law, the workhouse system and those individuals such as the complacent Mr Podsnap who would defend the system by denying the reality of poverty.<br /><br />This is, however, not just a fictional treatment of the theme that money is the root of all evils. Boffin and his wife remain kindly, good-hearted people despite their unexpected prosperity. There are also villains whose villainy does not spring from greed or avarice. The most notable example is Bradley Headstone, a brilliant portrait of a man in the grip of both obsessive love and obsessive jealousy. He reminds us that stalking, like political sleaze, is not an exclusively modern phenomenon.<br /><br />Perhaps the most complex character in the book is Bella Wilfer. Dickens has been criticised, often with some justice, for his inability to create credible heroines. He can create memorable female characters if they are old, ugly or wicked, but his young, beautiful and virtuous heroines are frequently pale and unconvincing figures who refuse to come to life. Everyone, for example, remembers \\"Great Expectations\\" for Miss Havisham, but few readers will remember it for Estella. Even in \\"Our Mutual Friend\\", Lizzie Hexam tends to conform to the type of the impossibly pure and noble beauty; only her social background sets her apart from Dickens's other, more middle-class, heroines. Bella is one of the few exceptions, precisely because she starts off as an unsympathetic character and gradually becomes more likeable. Initially a spoilt brat, she comes to realise that Rokesmith's unselfish love for her is more important than her hopes of wealth.<br /><br />The River Thames is a constant presence in the novel; several important scenes are set on it or by its banks, either in London itself or upstream or downstream of the capital. This helps to give the novel a thematic unity and draw together what is otherwise a rather sprawling, diffuse book. It reminds us that Dickens's London is one of literature's great fictional landscapes, a landscape rooted in the real Victorian city but given extra vividness by the power of his imagination. (Apart from the marsh country of North Kent, where he spent much of his boyhood, no other geographical locations come to life in his writing in quite the same way). \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" is not Dickens's greatest work, but it contains one of his best evocations of this urban landscape.

The official police view is that he slipped and fell while playing on the roof. Smilla Jaspersen, a neighbour of Isaiah and his mother, does not accept that his death was an accident. Isaiah had a fear of heights, so was unlikely to have been playing on the roof; moreover, the footprints in the snow do not support the police version. Smilla therefore decides to start her own investigation to find out what really happened.  <br /> <br />Isaiah and his mother belonged to Denmark's Greenlandic minority, and Smilla herself grew up in Greenland, the daughter of a Danish father and Greenlandic mother. She is in her late thirties, and works as a freelance mathematician and expert on the physics of ice and snow, although she has no formal academic qualifications, having left university without taking a degree. She is also known to the police as a former left-wing activist, which means that they do not welcome her intervention in the case. She discovers, however, that Isaiah's father was an employee of a Danish mining corporation and that he died in mysterious circumstances during an expedition to Greenland organised by this corporation. She begins to suspect that Isaiah's death was also in some way linked to the company, and learns that they are organising another voyage to Gela Alta, a small island off the coast of Greenland, although she does not know what the object of this voyage is. Nevertheless, she joins the crew of the ship as a stewardess, just ahead of the police who are trying to arrest her, believing that the key to the mystery lies on this remote island.  <br /> <br />In many ways the plot of the novel reminded me of a film. (It was itself made into a very good film by Bille August).The first part of the book, set in Copenhagen itself, was reminiscent of the films noirs of the forties and fifties. It could almost be the plot  ofa Humphrey Bogart film, if one can imagine a female, Danish Humphrey Bogart translated from Los Angeles to Copenhagen. A dogged, resourceful individual begins an investigation into a single event, and uncovers an increasingly complex web of corruption and wrongdoing. The second half of the book, set on the ship or on the island of Gela Alta, is more reminiscent of a standard thriller, with Smilla, in danger from ruthless villains and not knowing whom she can trust, desperately trying to unearth the secret at the heart of the mystery.  <br /> <br />In some ways Smilla is a not very appealing heroine. She seems cold and unemotional and can be appallingly rude and sarcastic. On the other hand, she is courageous, determined and has a strong sense of justice- another similarity with the private eye heroes of film noir, who often hid a code of honour and a determination to see justice done beneath a surface veneer of world-weary cynicism. For all her surface coldness, Smilla seems to have an extraordinary ability to persuade people to help her in her task when they have no obligation to do so, and even when to do so would involve them in breaking the law. (At times this ability struck me as rather unrealistic- I kept waiting to see who would be the next person to come forward and offer her their assistance).  <br /> <br />The book has some interesting points to make about the native Inuit people of Greenland and the way in which their traditional way of life has been affected by Danish colonialism. The descriptions of wintery Copenhagen and of the Arctic snow and ice are very atmospheric. Despite this, however, I am rather surprised by the extravagant praise which the book has attracted, both on this site and from outside reviewers. The reviews quoted in the publicity material include comparisons with Melville and Conrad, which seemed to me to be exaggerated- a closer comparison might be a sort of Alistair MacLean for intellectuals. Although it follows the traditional MacLean-style thriller in structure, Hoeg's novel does not really succeed as such. The plot is excessively complex and the pace of the book is too slow moving, often slowed down by the weight of the author's intellectual interests. (Besides the  physics of snow and ice, the Greenlandic language and parasitology play important roles). Like a number of others, I found the ending unconvincing, when Hoeg finally reveals the nature of the \\"McGuffin\\" for the sake of which the voyage to Greenland has been undertaken. I must say that I preferred August's film, which  simplified the plot and had a more satisfactory pace.  <br />	2004-11-19

Like many others in a similar situation, they spend their meagre savings on the purchase of an old car to take them to California, which they believe to be a land of plenty and opportunity where they will be able to make a good living as agricultural workers. When they arrive there, however, they find that they have been misled. California, its population swelled by thousands of migrant workers from other parts of America, already has a surplus of labour. Unemployment is therefore high, work difficult to find, wages low even when any work is to be found, and decent accommodation unavailable.<br /><br />The novel tells the story of a journey, and there are echoes of two other well-known stories about journeys; the Biblical book of Exodus and the true historical story of the nineteenth century American pioneers who opened up the West. Like their ancestors, the Okies, as the migrant workers become known, travel westwards in search of a better life. Like the Children of Israel, they journey out of what they perceive as a land of bondage towards what they see as a Promised Land. There are other echoes of the Bible in the book. The very title \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is taken from a line in The Battle Hymn of the Republic, a poem which uses Biblical language and imagery to convey America's vision of itself as a land of freedom. Several of the Joad family have Christian names taken from the Old Testament (Noah, Ruth, Rose of Sharon). Their friend Jim Casy, a former preacher who has started to doubt his former religious beliefs, nevertheless takes on an increasingly prophetic role as the story progresses. (He significantly has the same initials as Jesus Christ).<br /><br />In the Bible, of course, the Children of Israel did indeed reach the Promised Land after years of wandering in the wilderness, and many of the pioneers, despite dangers and hardship, did succeed in making better lives for themselves. In the novel, there is no such happy ending for the Joads or for the others who travel the same route. Steinbeck alternates between longer chapters, narrating the story of the Joads themselves, and shorter ones commenting on the general situation of the Okies. These shorter chapters are often used as vehicles for the author's left-wing political opinions, as he attacks the various individuals and corporations who have contributed to the plight of the dispossessed. The banks and landlords, in their desire for profit, force the tenant farmers off their land. The big Californian landowners lure them with misleading advertising promising abundant well-paid work, hoping to create a labour surplus and thereby keep wages down. The motor dealers exploit their desperation to get to California by selling them overpriced, unroadworthy vehicles, which they can only afford by selling off their few remaining possessions. When they try to dispose of these, however, they find that the dealers in second-hand goods are not prepared to offer anything other than rock-bottom prices. In California itself, the agricultural employers try to keep wages as low as possible, and vigorously resist, aided by a brutal police force, any attempts on the part of their workers to form unions or to combine to raise wages. Neither the State authorities nor the ordinary people of California welcome the newcomers in their midst, seeing them as a threat to either public order or to their living standards. The result is that the Okies lead a life of great hardship, living in squalid accommodation, desperately seeking work, however low-paid, in order to keep themselves from starving.<br /><br />As I said, there is no happy ending for the Joads, or even a hopeful one. Indeed, there is not even an unhappy or tragic resolution to their situation. The final image of the novelis the striking one Rose of Sharon using her breast milk, after giving birth to stillborn child, to feed a dying man. There is, however, no definite conclusion to the story of the family as a whole. We do not hear what becomes of Noah, who leaves the family shortly after their arrival in California, or of his brother Tom, who has gone on the run after killing a man, or of Rose of Sharon's husband, who has abandoned her. This lack of a definite ending is not, in my view, a fault. In other works of fiction, such as \\"The Pearl\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\", Steinbeck showed that he was well able to write logical, satisfying endings to stories when need be. His failure to provide such an ending to the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" was quite deliberate. There is no conclusion to the story of the Joads because there is no conclusion to the story of the Okies. Their tomorrow will be the same as their today; a desperate struggle for the basic necessities of life.<br /><br />In some ways- his indignation, his social concerns and in the clarity of his prose- Steinbeck reminds me of his British contemporary George Orwell. Certain passages struck me as particularly fine pieces of descriptive or polemical writing- notably the opening chapter, which describes the harsh drought which led to the creation of the Dust Bowl, and Chapter 25, in which the author contrasts the beauty and fruitfulness of the California landscape with the inhumanity of the big landowners, wilfully destroying their produce to keep prices high while other men go hungry.<br /><br />Criticisms have been made that not all economic migrants to California during the thirties suffered the same hardships as the Joads and that many of them actually did manage to find well-paid work and to raise their standards of living. It has also been claimed that not all Californians were as unwelcoming or hostile to the newcomers as those shown in the book. There may be some truth in these claims, but to dismiss the book on these grounds is no more reasonable than to refuse to read Dickens on the grounds that not all Victorian boarding-schools were as bad as Dotheboys Hall and not all factory owners as stony-hearted as Mr Bounderby. There can be no denying that the Depression was a time of poverty and hardship for many, and Steinbeck's novel is possibly the most powerful and memorable fictional evocation of that era.

The world is ruled by a single World State. Babies are no longer born, but are mass-produced in \\"hatcheries\\", or baby factories. One advantage of this method of reproduction is that it allows the State to create five main classes of people, each sub-divided into various sub-classes. At the top of the social pyramid are the physically and mentally superior \\"Alphas\\", who are the intellectuals and rulers of society; at the bottom are the \\"Epsilon semi-morons\\", the unskilled manual workers, with \\"Betas\\", \\"Gammas\\" and \\"Deltas\\" in between. Everyone, from their earliest childhood onward, is conditioned by \\"hynopaedia\\", or brainwashing, to accept their place in society and to obey its rules unquestioningly. The family has been abolished; people are conditioned not to fall in love, but are encouraged to have promiscuous recreational sex with as many partners as possible. (The idea of sex for reproductive purposes is regarded as disgusting; \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\" are obscene words). Christianity, culture and any form of science other than that officially approved by the State are all forbidden. The greatest good for the individual is \\"happiness\\"; negative emotions can be banished by the use of a psychoactive drug named \\"Soma\\".<br /><br />The State's \\"conditioning\\" of its citizens is, in most cases, a great success; nearly all spend their lives in the state of smug complacency which is what is meant by \\"happiness\\". Dissent and disaffection are the preserve of a few Alpha intellectuals who are generally dealt with by banishment to remote islands. One of these intellectuals, Bernard Marx, has started to question<br /><br /> the values of his society. He enjoys solitude, loves nature and believes in exclusive love, all of which are officially forbidden or discouraged. He uses his position as a psychologist to travel to a \\"Savage Reservation\\" in New Mexico. \\"Savages\\" are those peoples who live according to values other than those of the World State; the New Mexico \\"savages\\" are mostly people of American Indian descent who follow a traditional, non-industrial lifestyle. They still live in family units and produce children by the time-honoured method. Their religion is a mixture of primitive Christianity and indigenous beliefs. Their culture places great emphasis on marital fidelity and on stoicism and courage.  One of the \\"savages\\", John, travels back with Bernard to London, where he becomes an object of great curiosity to the members of the Alpha intellectual society. John, however, is not impressed by the \\"brave new world\\" he discovers, and the climax of the book arises out of the clash of two different sets of cultural values.<br /><br />\\"Brave New World\\" is often bracketed together with the other great British dystopian novel, George Orwell's \\"1984\\". During the days of the Cold War it was fashionable to say that, whereas \\"1984\\" was based upon the Communist East, \\"Brave New World\\" predicted the future of the capitalist West. There was some truth in this, but it was never more than a half-truth. There are two reasons for this. The first is that, whereas \\"1984\\" was written in the late forties, in the early days of the Cold War, and is indeed (among other things) a satire on Soviet or Nazi-style totalitarianism, \\"Brave New World\\" was written in 1932, a year before Hitler's accession to power, seven before the outbreak of World War II, and a decade and a half before it became fashionable to talk about a bipolar Communist/ capitalist world. The values of Huxley's imagined world are reflected in the names that he gives to his characters. Henry Ford is the most revered figure in this society, and the highest-ranking character that we meet, the World Controller Mustapha Mond, is named after another industrialist. (Sir Alfred Mond was the founder of the British industrial giant ICI). On the other hand, the most important female character in the book is called \\"Lenina\\", and one of the most important male ones has the surname Marx. Another character is called Benito; had the book been written a few years later there would doubtless have been an Adolf. The World State, in fact, represents a synthesis of Soviet-style Communism, Fascism and modern-day industrial capitalism. Just as Evelyn Waugh's Guy Crouchback saw the enemy in 1939 as \\"the Modern Age in arms\\", so Huxley's dystopia represents the Modern Age triumphant. His satire was aimed at all aspects of his society, not merely one particular political ideology.<br /><br />The other big difference between Orwell's vision and Huxley's is that Orwell's book is set only a few decades after the date of its publication; Huxley's is set several centuries in the future. Although it has some original features, such as the telescreens and the \\"Newspeak\\" language, Orwell's Oceania is largely a traditional dictatorship on the Nazi-Soviet model. Propaganda plays an important role, but in the last resort the power of the Party depends upon coercion by force of arms and fear of the secret police. The Party official O'Brien describes his chilling vision of the future as \\"a boot stamping on a human face forever\\", a vision with which he is quite happy because he knows that he will be one of those doing the stamping. Huxley's World State is a much more advanced and efficient tyranny. In his foreword to the novel (written in 1946) he states that his aim was to portray a society \\"in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude\\". Unlike the cynical O'Brien, Mustapha Mond believes in all sincerity that the control of the World State by himself and his fellow-members of the Alpha-plus elite will achieve the Utilitarian dream of \\"the greatest happiness of the greatest number\\".<br /><br />In many ways, \\"1984\\" is the better book when seen as a piece of literature. It has a better plot, the prose is more fluent and the characters are more credible. Huxley's characters are little more than mouthpieces for ideas; neither Bernard nor the Savage has the depth of Orwell's Winston Smith. For most of the second half of the twentieth century, \\"1984\\" also seemed more politically relevant. In the twenty-first, however, things may be changing. We may not yet have baby factories churning out groups of Gamma-pluses or Epsilon-minus semi-morons (although recent developments in cloning and genetic engineering suggest that that may be a distinct possibility), but many of Huxley's other predictions are coming true. The family has not yet been abolished, but its importance as an institution has declined since he wrote his novel Youth, beauty and sexual vigour are eulogised, improved contraception has led to a growth in promiscuous recreational sex dissociated from reproduction, psychoactive drugs (called Valium or Prozac rather than Soma) are increasingly used to control negative emotions, the increasing consumption of material goods is regarded as necessary for the economic good of society.

Despite their family relationship they are quite different in personality. Michel, a molecular biologist, is a cold, rational intellectual, an almost sexless bachelor, with little time for love. Bruno, on the other hand is a divorcee, a highly-sexed libertine whose main obsession in life is the pursuit of casual sex with as many women as possible. He is originally a teacher, but suffers a nervous breakdown after sexually assaulting a pupil, and resigns his post to take up a position as a civil servant in the Education Ministry.  <br /> <br />The book pursues the story of their lives from their birth in the fifties through to the early part of the twenty-first century. The author, however, was clearly aiming at something far more ambitious than a mere family saga. Michel Houellebecq uses the lives of these two ill-matched brothers to analyse the state of French and Western society in the second half of the twentieth century and the possible future of humanity.  <br /> <br />Houellebecq's analysis is a bleak and pessimistic one. To describe modern society he borrows metaphors from science. We are living in an \\"atomised\\" society where individuals are reduced to \\"elementary particles\\". Social cohesion and loyalty to others have broken down to be replaced by selfishness and isolation. Love and the family have been replaced by the selfish pursuit of sexual gratification and traditional religion by inane \\"New Age\\" cults. A hedonistic obsession with youth and beauty stemming from the \\"sexual revolution\\" of the sixties, combined with the decline of religious belief, has given us a morbid horror of old age and death.  <br /> <br />Midway through the book, Bruno and Michel discuss Aldous Huxley's novel \\"Brave New World\\". We may not yet have baby factories churning out Bokanovsky groups of Gamma-pluses or Epsilon-minus semi-morons (although recent developments in cloning and genetic engineering suggest that that may be a distinct possibility), but Houellebecq points out that many of Huxley's other predictions are coming true. The family has not yet been abolished, but its importance as an institution has declined since he wrote his novel Youth, beauty and sexual vigour are eulogised, improved contraception has led to a growth in promiscuous recreational sex dissociated from reproduction, psychoactive drugs (called Valium or Prozac rather than Soma) are increasingly used to control negative emotions, the increasing consumption of material goods is regarded as necessary for the economic good of society. \\"Atomised\\" can, in fact, be seen as an updating of Huxley's novel from the viewpoint of the late nineties.  <br /> <br />There is, however, one important way, besides the absence of baby factories, in which our age differs from Huxley's imagined future. Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" is the very opposite of an atomised society; it is a world in which \\"everyone belongs to everyone else\\", where the individual's sense of identity derives from his place in society and where social stability depends upon everyone knowing and accepting their place. Everyone, or almost everyone, seems to live in a permanent state of smug contentment; discontent is confined to a few intellectual misfits. In Houellebecq's view, angst-ridden unhappiness is the universal lot of late twentieth-century man. The novel ends with an ironic science-fiction postscript; Michel's scientific researches are used as the basis for a future in which human beings as we know them are replaced by a new species of human able to reproduce by cloning themselves. In this imagined future, humanity is too depressed and apathetic to do anything to prevent its own extinction, indeed, positively welcomes the prospect.  <br /> <br />Houellebecq has been described as a reactionary, but I find thisdescription inaccurate. What he is is a cynic. Reaction is a fundamentally optimistic philosophy; the reactionary believes that a return to traditional values is not only desirable but also possible, and that society will be greatly improved by this reversion from the status quo to the status quo ante. Others may strongly disagree with both his diagnosis and his prescribed remedy, but he himself is in no doubt that a cure is possible. The cynic, on the other hand, believes that the patient is terminally ill (to continue the medical analogy) and can prescribe no cure other than euthanasia.  <br /> <br />There is a good deal to enjoy in this novel, including its satire and cynical black humour. Particularly striking were his accounts of Bruno's stay in a New Age commune complete with workshops on crystal healing and Siberian shamanism (New Age philosophies seem to be one of the author's betes noires) and of his visit, together with his mistress Christiane, to a nudist colony for the sexually liberated. Those easily offended by sexually explicit material would do well to avoid this book, although Houellebecq's descriptions of Bruno's desperate and joyless sexual encounters are far from erotic.  <br /> <br />There is certainly room for disagreement with Houellebecq's view of society, and many of us may take a more optimistic view. (Neither religious faith nor romantic love, for example, is as dead today as he seems to assume). Nevertheless, as a novel of ideas, \\"Atomised\\" is provocative and stimulating. Its ambitious themes led the British writer Julian Barnes to say of it that it \\"hunts big game while others settle for shooting rabbits\\".	2004-09-11

Although the war is coming to an end, the country is still under German occupation, and the book's title refers to the special military trains which need to be kept under close guard as they travel to the front.  <br /> <br />The central character, Milos Hrma, is a young apprentice traffic controller, and the opening scenes of the book tend towards the comic, as Milos describes the attempts of his colleagues to get on with their everyday lives, seemingly oblivious to the historic events taking place around them. Milos's boss, Station-Master Lansky, is a ridiculous figure, obsessed with promoting himself both in the social hierarchy (he lays claim to aristocratic lineage) and in the hierarchy of the Czech railway system. Despite his eagerness for promotion, however, he pays more attention to his hobby of pigeon breeding than he does to the requirements of his job. Lansky's subordinate, Dispatcher Hubicka, is equally neglectful of his duties, although his main obsession is pursuing women; he is facing disciplinary proceedings for the offence of misusing Government property by using the station's official stamps to decorate the backside of an attractive young female telegraphist.  <br /> <br />As the story progresses, it takes on a darker tone. We learn that Milos has recently returned to work after three months in hospital following an unsuccessful attempt at suicide. The cause of this attempt was depression brought on by impotence and his inability to consummate his relationship with his girlfriend. The latter part of the book has two themes- his continuing obsession with losing his virginity and the plot he forms with Hubicka to help the Czech Resistance by destroying one of the Germans' special trains.  <br /> <br />The expression \\"tragi-comedy\\" is perhaps over-used in literary criticism, being all too often a category to enable the lazy critic to pigeonhole works that resist neat pigeonholing- certain of Shakespeare's plays, for example. It seems to me, however, that the adjective \\"tragi-comic\\" is indeed an appropriate one to use about \\"Closely Observed Trains\\" because of the contrast between the tragic situation of the Czech people under the German occupation and the many comic incidents that take place, such as Hubicka's adventures with the telegraphist, or Lansky's habit of shouting his criticism of the morals of society down the ventilation shaft in the station kitchen. The same incident, indeed, may have both comic and serious overtones, as when Lansky, in protest against the German invasion of Poland, kills his German pigeons and replaces them with Polish ones- an act both cruel and ridiculous. The book is full of gruesome but absurd details, such as the three dead horses thrown from a train and left by the railway lines. This is a book of less than a hundred pages, but Hrabal is able to fill that space with a fantastic amount of detail, both trivial and serious. <br /> <br />The central theme of the book is the various strategies people use to survive in the tragic circumstances of war and occupation- courageous acts of resistance, petty acts of defiance (such as using the metal from a downed German plane to roof rabbit-hutches and chicken-coops) and continuing to pursue the trivia of existence. Sometimes they use a mixture of all three. One can easily see why the Communist authorities disliked Hrabal's work; they had no objection to tales of heroic deeds in the fight against fascism, but these had to be viewed through the simplistic ideology of Marxism-Leninsm and placed in the context of the class struggle. Hrabal's world was more complex and less ideological. There is a place for courage in that world, but also a place for compromise and for the apolitical details of everyday life. Seen in this context, Milos's bravery seems both moreimpressive and the book's ending more poignant. This is a fine piece of writing and, given that it was written under Communist rule, a brave one.	2004-09-08

This ambitious series of novels aimed to tell the story of a man's life as seen through the eyes of his contemporaries (\\"Killing Mr Watson\\"), the same man's life as seen by posterity (\\"Lost man's River\\") and finally his life as seen by the man himself. In \\"Bone by Bone\\" Edgar Watson tells the story of his own life, starting with his childhood in South Carolina during and after the Civil War, and ending with his killing by a mob in Southern Florida in 1910.  <br /> <br />The early parts of this novel are probably the best, particularly the descriptions of Watson's miserable childhood at the hands of his brutal, drunken father Elijah (\\"Ring-Eye Lige\\"). Elijah Watson (who himself played a less than glorious part in the war) stands as a symbol of the defeated post-bellum South -its disillusionment, its senseless racist violence, its desperate attempts to justify itself through the myth of the \\"Great Lost Cause\\". The teenage Edgar, hard working and determined, attempts to rise above the poverty and degradation into which his once-proud family have fallen, but his attempts are doomed when he is falsely accused of the murder of Selden Tilghman, a relative who has angered local opinion by his liberal, anti-slavery sentiments, and is forced to flee his home state.  <br /> <br />The novel proceeds to relate Watson's life as seen through his own eyes. The rest of his life is mostly spent in Florida, with brief spells in Oklahoma and Arkansas. In time, Watson rises out of poverty to become a prosperous sugar-cane planter in the Everglades, but at the same time his character deteriorates, until by the end of his life he has become as violent and ruthless as his father, ready to exploit, bully, threaten or even murder those who stand in his way and to sacrifice or alienate his family and friends in pursuit of his ambitions.  <br /> <br />\\"Bone by Bone\\" is better than its predecessor in the trilogy, \\"Lost Man's River\\", the dull story of Watson's son Lucius and his attempts to find out the truth about his father's legacy. Neither of the two later books, however, are as good as the first volume, \\"Killing Mr Watson\\", which tells Watson's story through the eyes of a number of those who knew him using a \\"multiple narrator\\" technique. This technique enables Mr Matthiessen to maintain an intriguing ambiguity. There is no authoritative author's voice to tell us whether Watson is good or evil or a mixture of the two, or whether his killing was bloody murder or a justified act of self-defence. The fascination of the book is that the reader must work this out for himself or herself, and different readers will (I suspect) come to different conclusions.  <br /> <br />In \\"Bone by Bone\\" we finally get to hear the authoritative version of Watson's life- his own- and the ambiguity is lost. In the early part of the book, Watson may come across as a man more sinned against than sinning, but by the end any sympathy we may have had for him has been lost as we realise that his neighbours' suspicions of him were, by and large, justified. (This revelation will come as no surprise to those who have read \\"Lost Man's River\\"). The first-person narrative means that Watson dominates this book to an excessive extent; selfish and self-obsessed, he takes little interest in those around him, except insofar as they can be useful to him or stand in his way. The other people in the story do not therefore emerge as characters in their own right as they did in \\"Killing Mr Watson\\", and we have no voice to counterbalance Watson's own. The book works as a powerfully-written character-study of a villainous character, but its lack of any sympathetic figure to balance its central villain meant that I did not find it a very enjoyable read.  <br />	2004-09-08

Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, two twenty-something lovers from the Manchester suburbs, were convicted of murdering a twelve-year-old boy, a ten-year-old girl and a seventeen-year-old youth between 1963 and 1965. (We now know that they also murdered two other young persons during this period). The name \\"Moors Murders\\" derives from the fact that they buried their victims on the desolate moorland outside the city.  What made these crimes so shocking, apart from the youth of the victims, was that Brady and Hindley were an outwardly respectable young couple and that they had no motive for killing their victims, all of whom were complete strangers to them, other than a Sadistic delight in killing for its own sake. (I spell the word with a capital letter because Brady was a devotee of the philosophy of the Marquis de Sade). The nation was particularly shocked to learn that they had made a series of photographs and tape recordings documenting the sufferings of some of their victims.  <br /> <br />\\"True Crime\\" books are normally written either by journalists or by academics specialising in criminology or psychology. Whether the author's interest is journalistic or academic, however, the books tend to be dry and factual in style. Emlyn Williams's book, however, is very different. He was neither a journalist nor an academic, but an actor and playwright, and \\"Beyond Belief\\" shows the clear hallmarks of the creative writer.  <br /> <br />Whereas most \\"True Crime\\" writers stick to fact and the interpretation of fact, Williams, as he states in his introduction, adds a third element, \\"surmise\\". By this he means that it is his intention to write an imaginative recreation of the crimes, speculating on the thoughts and feelings of the two murderers and on conversations that they might have had with each other and with third parties. Williams believed that this method would enable him to tell the storywith what he called \\"dual accuracy\\"- the accuracy of history and the accuracy of imaginative understanding. The result is that the book reads more like a novel, with Ian and Myra as the principal characters, than it does the traditional non-fiction book.  <br /> <br />This method certainly allows Williams to create a vivid picture of the two murderers. The portrait of Brady is particularly memorable. The illegitimate son of a Glasgow waitress, he was fostered by a local couple as a young boy and moved to Manchester as a teenager to live with his birth mother and her new husband. He had three names; Ian Stewart (his mother's maiden name), Ian Sloan (the name of his foster-parents) and Ian Brady (the name of his stepfather). Williams suggests that these changes and the lack of a stable background might have led to him suffering an identity crisis. He was a strange, obsessive loner, whose main interests were cinema going (mostly watching violent crime thrillers) and reading about sado-masochistic sex and Nazi atrocities. He had neo-Nazi political sympathies, but never joined any organised political party. He was involved in petty crime during his teens, with the result that he spent time in Borstal, but by his late twenties, when the murders were committed, he was, to the outside world, a reformed character, holding down a white-collar job with a respectable firm.  <br /> <br />Myra Hindley, who worked for the same company as Brady, was, before she met him, even more ordinary, with little to mark her out from thousands of other working-class girls. Williams suggests that she may have been deeply influenced by an incident in her teenage years, when a childhood friend died in a drowning accident, and that this left her with a deep sense of grievance against the world. As a result, she may have been an easy convert to the nihilistic philosophy of Brady, particularly as she had fallen obsessively in love with him.  <br /> <br />The book was originally published in 1967, the year after the trial. As a result it gives not only a vivid picture of its main characters but also a vivid picture of the era in which it is set, a decade in which trams still ran through the streets, LPs were the latest in musical technology, tower-blocks were still trumpeted as the solution to the nation's housing problems and \\"Bonanza\\" was one of the most popular programmes on television. There were, of course, other books published about these crimes, but Williams's is, I believe, the only one still in print, forty years after the events it describes and nearly twenty after the author's own death. The reason is probably his aim of pursuing \\"accuracy of imaginative understanding\\"; his imaginative technique means the book reads much more easily than do many dry, factual accounts of true crimes. <br /> <br />The exact motive for these murders was probably never known to anyone except Brady, Hindley and their Maker, and now that Hindley is dead and Brady is confined in a hospital for the criminally insane, it is unlikely ever to come to light. No doubt the reason lay somewhere in their psychological makeup, but we will never know what psychological factor led them to become vicious killers when thousands of others from similar backgrounds became law-abiding citizens or, at worst, only minor criminals. We cannot, therefore, ever be sure whether Williams achieved his aim. Nevertheless, his theories are never implausible; if we can never be sure that this is how it was, we can at least think that this is how it might have been. If this were a work of crime fiction, Williams's Ian and Myra would be psychologically believable, if monstrous, characters. The book is, of course, a work of non-fiction, but nevertheless highly readable.	2004-07-31
US	36348634	R1W2YESIT5OGT4	0452277760	615906025	Bedrock	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Something Nasty in the Woodshed	An earlier Lisa Alther character, Ginny Babcock in \\"Kinflicks\\", once described herself as \\"The Emma Bovary of Stark's Bog\\", and Clea Shawn, the central figure of \\"Bedrock\\", also has much in common with Flaubert's heroine. Indeed, she can be diagnosed as a sufferer from what in French would be called \\"le Bovarysme\\"- a state of restless discontent coupled with a firm belief that the next major development in one's life, whatever it may be, will bring lasting happiness and cure one's discontent for ever. <br />Clea is a successful, middle-aged art-photographer, married to a wealthy New York business executive and the mother of two children, both students at university. She and her husband Turner have an \\"open marriage\\" which allows them to conduct affairs with other parties, and Clea has thrown herself passionately into a number of such relationships in a vain attempt to find a greater intimacy than she enjoys with her husband. Neither wealth, success in her career nor her other lovers, however, have brought Clea much happiness, and she is continually in search of something that will bring her the satisfaction she craves. <br />At the start of the book Clea has just fallen in love again. Not, this time, with a person but with a place- Roches Ridge, the small town in Vermont where she has (against her husband's wishes) bought a house as her rural retreat. Clea has an idealised view of small-town life as a peaceful retreat from a bustling, crime-ridden city like New York. It is, however, a standard literary cliché that the more idyllic and tranquil a small town appears on the surface, the more likely it is to prove to be a place of rampant corruption, raging hatreds and illicit sexual passions, and Roche's Ridge proves to be no exception. <br />There are two distinct threads running through the book, one basically serious, the other basically comic. The serious thread concerns Clea herself, her attempts to find happiness and her relationships with those around her. Themost important figure in her life is neither her husband (a remote figure who spends most of his time away from her on business trips abroad) nor any of the other men she takes as lovers but her closest female friend, Elke, a German-born sculptress. Clea and Elke are contrasting characters. Both are discontented, but only Clea looks for a cure for discontent. Whereas Clea is an eternal optimist, persuaded that every change in her life, be it a new love affair or the purchase of a rural property, will bring her the contentment that has hitherto eluded her, Elke is a pessimist, convinced that life is both cruel and meaningless and that happiness will forever elude her and the rest of humanity. Both see themselves as creative artists, but their attitude to art is as different as their attitude to life. Clea's photographs are deliberately composed to be aesthetically appealing, with anything sordid excluded, whereas Elke's sculptures focus on cruelty and suffering.<br />The more serious scenes in the book generally take place in New York. The comic thread concerns the people of Roche's Ridge. The portrait that Ms Alther draws of the small community is a broad and satirical one. Just about every inhabitant is either mad, or bad, or both. The town is home to two groups of outsiders, one an apocalyptic religious cult, the other a lesbian-feminist commune, both led by sinister guru-figures. The natives of the town itself, however, are scarcely less eccentric; each seems to be prey to his or her own private obsession, such as Calvin Roche, who longs to escape to Texas to live the life of a cowboy, the bodybuilding hairdresser Jared McQueen who tries to persuade all the town's women to adopt punk hairstyles and Dack Marsh (real name Dacron), an artist who specialises in making arrangements of animal bones. (The scene where the simpleton Dack is taken up by New York sophisticates as a \\"primitive\\" artist allows Ms Alther to aim some sharp satirical barbs at the modern art scene). Underlying the placid surface of Roche's Ridge is an undercurrent of sexual perversity and lawlessness; one of the book's key moments comes when Clea makes an unwelcome discovery about the nasty goings-on in the shed owned by her neighbours, the disreputable Marsh family. <br />The book's main weakness is perhaps that its serious and satirical threads are not wholly integrated. At times I felt that I was actually reading two novels at once, switching from one to the other at the end of each chapter. There is an attempt to bring together all the book's themes at the end, but I did not find this wholly successful.  I felt that Ms Alther achieved a more satisfying blend of the serious and the satirical in her two earlier novels \\"Kinflicks\\" and \\"Original Sins\\", possibly because in those books the satire had some serious points to make. In \\"Bedrock\\" it seems more like satire for satire's sake. I also found myself growing bored with the depressing figure of Elke, with her tendency to wallow in her own misery and in the misery of others. <br />Nevertheless, I have still given this book four stars because of the wit and style of Ms Alther's writing, particularly when she is in her comic mode. Although her satire has less political edge than it did in her earlier works, I still found myself laughing at the eccentric townsfolk of Roche's Ridge. Clea, for all her idiosyncrasies, is a likeable heroine, an older (but not necessarily wiser) version of Ginny Babcock. At least things finish more happily for her than they did for Emma Bovary.	2004-07-16

Bawn, an idealistic Socialist, was during the fifties, sixties and early seventies, the chairman of Glasgow City Council's Housing Committee, and was responsible for building the tower blocks which at the time were seen as the answer to the city's perennial housing problems. At the time when the book is set (the mid-nineties), however, Bawn is a sick and dying old man, living in a flat in one of his own blocks. He is visited by Jamie, his grandson whom he has not seen for many years. Ironically Jamie, who now lives in England, is a demolition contractor who makes his living by demolishing blocks of the type that his grandfather was instrumental in building. The story is mostly told from Jamie's viewpoint, although there are also passages of third-person narrative filling in the details of Hugh's past life. Besides narrating what occurs during the three months or so that he spends in Scotland with his grandparents, Jamie also tells of his own past, particularly his miserable childhood at the hands of his brutal, alcoholic father, Hugh's son Robert. <br />The book raises a number of interlinked questions concerning the conflict between idealism and pragmatism, the conflict between the desire for change and the desire to preserve the past and the conflict between the generations. Building, of course, is frequently used, especially by the political Left, as a metaphor for effecting social or political change, in phrases such as \\"building the future\\" or \\"building a new society\\". Hugh sees himself as a builder in both the literal and the metaphorical senses of the word. His quarrel with Jamie's generation is that they are, both literally and metaphorically, demolishing what his generation built. In Hugh's eyes modern politicians, both Conservative and New Labour, are undoing the social reforms of the past. <br />There is no doubting the sincerity of Hugh's desire for social reform, rooted in his own impoverished Glaswegian childhood. Nevertheless, his plans to improve the world have proved less successful than he hoped. The buildings he constructed are unpopular with those who have to live in them and with the wider public who regard them as eyesores. At the end of his life, he finds himself under attack, accused of cutting corners and using cheap materials in his zeal to build as many housing units as quickly and as cheaply as possible. It always struck me that the attraction of the high-rise tower block to the planners, architects and housing officials of the third quarter of the twentieth century stemmed less from a sober calculation of its benefits and disadvantages than from an emotional commitment to \\"modernity\\" for its own sake. From their perspective, the main advantage of the tower-block was precisely that it was radically different from any form of housing that had preceded it. Today, it is the tower blocks themselves that look like outdated relics of a bygone age, far more than do conventional houses built during the same period. Nothing dates more quickly than yesterday's view of tomorrow. <br />As one might expect with a book dealing with the dying days of an old man, there is little in the way of dramatic action. Mr O'Hagan's main concern is with his characters'- especially Jamie's- thoughts and feelings. In some ways it struck me, despite its length of nearly three hundred pages, as being closer to a long short story than to a traditional novel. In places it can seem static, but overall there is, nevertheless, a sense of movement, as Jamie comes closer to reconciliation with his grandfather and a partial understanding of what the old man and his contemporaries were trying to achieve. There is also a sense that Jamie is moving closer to forgiving his own father, whom he meets again at Hugh's funeral. <br />The writing struck me as uneven. Mr O'Hagan has a good eye for the details of modern urban life, and conveys the beauty of the Scottish landscape in some of the finest passages in the book. On the other hand, some of the lengthy dialogues tended to drag, as did passages such as the description of Hugh's funeral. I was both fascinated and frustrated by the characters, especially the flawed idealist Hugh- frustrated in that I found myself wanting to know much more about his previous life than I was actually told. I wanted to know more about his childhood, his time as Glasgow's \\"Mr Housing\\" and his relationship with his own son Robert. I wanted to know why the son of an idealistic reformer should have become a cynical, drunken ne'er-do-well. (There is a hint, not fully developed, that Hugh was too preoccupied with political affairs to have much time for his family). If Mr O'Hagan is considering writing a sequel, there is certainly enough material here for a second novel. <br />Although this is not a great novel, it is both a readable and an interesting one, introducing an fascinating character and touching upon such major topics as religion (Hugh and his wife are devout Catholics), the decline of traditional Socialism, the clash between ideals and reality, the Scottish national identity, the relationship between the generations and the burden of inheritance.	2004-06-25
US	36348634	R27A06LZ6H09Z4	0299186547	192394669	Tieta (THE AMERICAS)	Books	2	7	20	N	N	A Cross between a Tract and a Soap Opera	\\"Tieta\\" is set in Agreste, a small coastal town in north-eastern Brazil, whose main occupations seem to be fishing (often a cover for smuggling) and goat-breeding. The central character, Tieta herself, left the town as a teenager after being banished from her parents' house for her promiscuous behaviour. After nearly thirty years she returns as a wealthy woman; the local people believe her to be the widow of a prominent businessman, but the truth is that she was the man's mistress rather than his wife and that her wealth was earned as the owner of a high-class brothel in Sao Paulo. Upon her return, Tieta becomes caught up in a campaign against the building of a titanium dioxide factory on the coast near the town. <br />The novel was written in the seventies and is set in the sixties, and its theme reflects the growing environmental awareness of those decades. In his youth, Amado was an enthusiastic communist, and \\"Tieta\\" can be read as an attack upon capitalism, although from an environmentalist viewpoint rather than from a Marxist one. Amado makes it quite clear that his sympathies are with those who hope to prevent the erection of the factory. He paints the industrialists who plan to build the plant as greedy polluters of the environment, and has great fun at the expense of those local people, particularly the local government official Ascanio, who support them out of an abstract belief in \\"progress\\" but who have no idea what titanium dioxide is and cannot even say if it is a gas, a liquid or a solid. <br />Unfortunately, by the end of the novel the reader, unless he or she has some previous knowledge of chemistry, will be just as ignorant of the true nature of titanium dioxide as the hapless Ascanio. In the nearly 700 pages of a novel in which the titanium dioxide industry plays an important part, Senhor Amado does not find room to impart this seemingly important information. Neither does he find room to tell us what this chemical is used for, what economic valueit has, how toxic it is, why it poses such a pollution risk, and what measures can be taken to overcome that risk. One is simply left with the impression that it is a deadly poison and that only a particularly evil person would want to manufacture it. <br />Besides giving us an obviously slanted view of the chemical industry, Amado also gives us an idealised picture of Agreste and its surrounding area. I had always got the impression that the north-east of Brazil was an impoverished area, but in the novel Agreste is frequently described, particularly by Tieta and her travelling companion Leonora, as a \\"paradise\\", and some of the local residents echo that description. The town is peaceful and law-abiding, and the only unemployed person seems to be an old beggar named Goatstink. The inhabitants are not exactly rich, but they seem to be content and to have sufficient for their needs. Their main complaint is that life in Agreste is too quiet and that their lives lack excitement. Amado seems to be afraid of the argument that industrial development might relieve poverty and unemployment, so he denies that those factors exist. The area where the new factory is to be built is, of course, a stretch of coastline famous for its beauty. Although the novel was clearly written in support of the \\"green\\" cause, it is too biased and one-sided to be of any real help to it. <br />Besides environmentalism, the novel also deals with another preoccupation of the sixties and seventies, sexual liberation. As well as grasping industrialists, Amado also targets the sexual hypocrisy of Brazilian society. The townspeople of Agreste welcome Tieta because they see her as a rich, respectable widow; if they knew the truth about her, they would reject her, even though most of the male inhabitants of the town themselves frequent the local brothel. One of the few sexually continent characters, Tieta's widowed sister Perpetua, is portrayed as mean-spirited, hypocritical and money-grubbing. Amado's view seems to be that sexual activity, in virtually any form, is a good thing, and that trying to control it only leads to hypocrisy and repression. This is not an erotic novel in the sense of one that contains detailed descriptions of bedroom activity, but it is one in sex is frequently mentioned. There are allusions to most forms of sexual activity, all presented with lip-smacking relish. Amado was so keen to present the arguments for sexual liberalism that he did not stop to consider questions such as whether a brothel is the ideal workplace for a fourteen year old girl. No doubt only a confirmed reactionary like Perpetua would allow herself to be troubled by such questions. <br />Although I have given the book a largely negative review, readers should not allow that to prejudice themselves against Amado's works in general. This was only the second of his novels that I have read, but the other, \\"Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon\\" was much better, and, to my mind, justified the claims that are often made for him as a great novelist. \\"Tieta\\" does not. It is overlong and overly propagandist and the characters, with the partial exception of the colourful if shameless Tieta herself, tend towards the stereotypical. (Ruthless businessman, tart with a heart, randy teenager, corrupt politician, frustrated old maid, etc.) The end result resembles a cross between a tract and a soap opera, written by an old man (Amado was in his mid-sixties when he wrote it) trying to be more trendy than the younger generation. <br />PS. Titanium dioxide is a solid, chiefly used as a white pigment. It is classified as a low toxicity risk except in cases of chronic inhalation.	2004-05-30
US	36348634	R3E0OZ56OBSIVY	067973564X	201686026	Lost Man's River: Shadow Country Trilogy (2)	Books	2	9	9	N	Y	Bogged Down in an Impenetrable Swamp	I sat down to read this book with a sense of eager anticipation, having greatly enjoyed Peter Matthiessen's first book in the Watson trilogy, \\"Killing Mr Watson\\". I put it down, nearly a month later, with a sense of profound disappointment. \\"Lost Man's River\\" is not a book in the same class as its predecessor. <br /> \\"Killing Mr Watson\\" told the story of Edgar Watson's life in Southern Florida and his eventual death at the hands of a posse of his neighbours. \\"Lost Man's River\\" tells the story of Watson's son Lucius, a historian with both an academic and an emotional interest in finding out the truth about his father's life. (Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that, while Lucius's academic interest lies in finding out the truth about his father's life, his emotional interest lies in confirming his own preconceived ideas about his father's life). By the time of the events narrated in the book (around 1960) Lucius is an elderly man. The book follows his journeys around Florida and his meetings with the surviving few people who remember Edgar Watson, including his reunion with his long-lost brother Rob. <br />The sentimental journeyings of a septuagenarian historian do not make for an enthralling plot; indeed, the book has a loose, episodic structure and very little in the way of coherent plot at all. In \\"Killing Mister Watson\\" the characters were vividly drawn, especially the dominating figure of Watson himself. In \\"Lost Man's River\\" there is much less in the way of characterisation. Although Watson is an ever-present thought in Lucius's mind, he obviously cannot be introduced as a character in his own right as he has been dead for fifty years. Lucius is merely a bore, and the other characters are stiff and lifeless. The old people's reminiscences of the past are tedious and confusing, and tend to get bogged down in an excess of genealogical detail. In an attempt to add to the interest of the plot, Matthiessen provides a brief love-interest for Lucius in the formof a much younger woman, but this episode struck me as very unconvincing. <br />Not everything about the book is bad. There are some vivid descriptions of the natural beauty of the Everglades. There is also some sharp commentary about the way in which that natural beauty has been despoiled by the modern world, and about Southern racism. Unlike most of what has preceded it, the ending is genuinely gripping, as old feuds end in violence and Lucius makes an unwelcome discovery which forces him to reassess his view of the past. Unfortunately, to get to the ending one has to wade through some very tedious passages; like some of the characters, I often felt that I was bogged down in an impenetrable swamp.	2004-05-30
US	36348634	R37QA3OGC6NXAG	0618346244	669379389	The Lord of the Rings. 3 Vol. Set	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A World of His Own	I have come late to Tolkien's works, despite (or rather because of) the fact that they were cult reading when I was at school. One of my classmates, then aged about sixteen, proudly boasted that he had read the entire work about fifty times, and ever since I have tended to associate Tolkien with obsessive fanatics. I was, however, eventually persuaded to read the books by Peter Jackson's excellent trilogy of films.<br />The plot of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", a novel of well over 1,000 pages, is too complex to be summarised here in any depth. At its centre is a magic ring (a motif Tolkien seems to have borrowed from Wagner). This ring can give its owner immense power, but can only be used for evil purposes. At the beginning of the work the ring is owned by the elderly hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who acquired it many years before (the story of how he did so is told in \\"The Hobbit\\") and has no idea of its power. He is warned, however, by the wizard Gandalf that the evil Dark Lord Sauron, who originally forged the ring, is trying to regain it in order to enslave Middle-Earth (the imagined world in which the story is set).<br />The story has two interlocking themes. Firstly, there is the journey of Bilbo's nephew Frodo to destroy the ring, something that can only be achieved by casting it into Mount Doom, the volcano in which it was eventually forged. (During the early part of his journey, Frodo has a number of companions- the \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\"- but only one of these, his faithful servant Sam, stays with him to the end). The second is the war that is waged by Sauron and his allies against the peoples of Middle Earth- humans, hobbits, elves, dwarves and ents (walking trees)- and of their courageous resistance.<br />The book is much more than a fantasy adventure. Many have tried to read hidden meanings into it, both religious and political, even though Tolkien explicitly stated that it was not an allegory. Certainly, it is not an allegory in the sense of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\" or \\"Animal Farm\\"- a book where every detail has a symbolic meaning or can be related to an actual historical event. (Sauron, for example is not simply another name for the Devil or a disguised portrait of Hitler). This does not, however, mean that there is no symbolism in \\"Lord of the Rings\\". The main symbol is the ring itself, which represents evil and its power to corrupt the human spirit. The heroes such as Gandalf and Frodo do not dare to use the ring against Sauron because they fear that if they do they will be corrupted by its power and become as evil as he is. The various races who people Middle Earth also have symbolic functions, especially the Elves and the Orcs. The former, in Tolkien's world, are not small fairy-like creatures but an ancient race, beautiful, wise and noble who represent the higher, spiritual side of human nature. The brutal and aggressive Orcs, by contrast, represent its lower, bestial side.<br />The theme of good versus evil is one that is capable of either a religious or a secular interpretation, but Tolkien himself was a devout Christian, and some of the themes of the book seem to be directly related to Christian ideas. There is no single Christ-figure, but three of the heroes have Christ-like attributes. Frodo, the ring-bearer, symbolically bears the sin of the world. Gandalf the wise and benevolent sage rises from the dead after dying in a struggle with an evil adversary. The final part of the book is entitled \\"The Return of the King\\"; this relates to the reappearance of Aragorn, the lost heir to the throne of the kingdom of Gondor, but can also be taken as a reference to the Second Coming.<br />So far, I have discussed the work in largely abstract terms, but it is not principally a book about abstractions. What sets it apart from many other fantasy works is that Middle-Earth is brilliantly imagined in all its concrete reality. It is a world that is in some respects a familiar one. Its geography, climate, flora and fauna are closely based on those of Europe. The hobbits, for all their small stature, hairy feet and habit of living in holes, are also reassuringly familiar; conservative and phlegmatic by temperament, they seem like the Middle-Earth equivalent of tweedy, pipe-smoking Englishmen. In other respects, Tolkien's world is highly exotic one. He spent many years of his life developing his ideas about the races who inhabit it, working out full details of their cultures, their histories, their mythologies and (most important from his point of view as he was an academic philologist) their languages. Many of these details are set out in the Appendices which, although they do not form part of the main story, are nevertheless a fascinating part of the work.<br />Against this background, Tolkien creates a cast of characters who, even when they have a symbolic function, also come to life as individuals. (Something else that sets him apart from many other fantasy writers). Besides those mentioned above, I should also mention Sam, Frodo's loyal and steadfast servant, Saruman, a former colleague of Gandalf who was tempted by cynicism and self-interest to throw in his lot with Sauron, and especially Gollum. Gollum is the mysterious creature from whom Bilbo originally won the ring, and whose life is dominated by the desire to recapture it. He is vicious and treacherous, and yet at the same time capable of arousing pity. He both desires the ring and fears its power; at the end he will play an ironic yet vital role in its destruction. From evil, good can sometimes spring.<br />Having read the work, I can now understand why it has such a fascination for many people, even if I have no immediate plans to read it another forty-nine times. In some literary and academic circles there may be a prejudice against the heroic fantasy genre, which is regarded (with some justification) as tending to produce shallow, one-dimensional works. The miracle of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is that Tolkien has taken this unfashionable genre and used it to produce a rich, multi-layered work, one which has taken its rightful place among the masterpieces of twentieth-century English literature.y based on those of Europe.

(A hobbit, for those not familiar with Tolkien's world, is a small, hairy-footed person who lives in a hole in the ground). Along the way, they have various adventures at the hands of the other inhabitants of Tolkien's imagined realm of Middle Earth- trolls, goblins, elves, animals and even humans.<br />If the above brief synopsis makes the book seem like a twee Enid Blyton tale for infants, all I can say is that it is not. Unlike the more adult The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit probably was written primarily with children in mind, but it is the sort of children's book that can easily be enjoyed by adults. Indeed, it can in many ways be read as an introduction to The Lord of the Rings, because it introduces characters such as Gollum and Gandalf, who will play an important role in the later work, and because it tells of the earlier history of the Ring, which it will later fall to Bilbo's nephew Frodo to destroy.<br />The Hobbit can be divided into two parts, corresponding to the time before and the time after the finding of the gold. The earlier part is lighter in tone. Although Bilbo and the dwarves face dangers in the course of their journey, they are able, by courage, ingenuity and luck, to overcome them; they are always the heroes, and the reader's sympathy is with them as they battle with the malevolent trolls, goblins and wolves they meet along their way. Bilbo is a particularly well-drawn character. He starts out as hesitant and nervous about the enterprise (hobbits tend to be conservative and unadventurous), but as it progresses finds within himself reserves of courage and resourcefulness, which enable him to rescue his companions from danger. (The dwarves, on the other hand, do not really come across as sharply-defined individuals, apart from their determined, headstrong leader Thorin Oakenshield and the fat, lazy Bombur).<br />After the gold is found, the tone of the book becomes darker. The dwarves become less heroic and more morally ambivalent as disputes over the true ownership of the recovered treasure threaten to lead to war. The issue is not finally resolved until a bloody and destructive battle has taken place. What started as a light-hearted children's adventure story becomes a parable about the corrupting nature of greed and the destructive power of violence.

US	36348634	R2KKILPIV8BZXZ	038000545X	255713733	Victoria	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Jewel	Knut Hamsun has sometimes been described as the Thomas Hardy of Scandinavian literature, and the theme of Victoria- love between two people of different social classes- is one which Hardy treated several times. Here the protagonists are Johannes, the son of a miller, and Victoria, the daughter of the local squire, who meet and fall in love as children. Although they continue to love one another throughout their lives, they are separated by circumstances and the story ends tragically. <br />The forces that conspire to thwart their love are more complex than simple snobbery or class-distinction. During the period in which the book is set (the 1890s), the marriage of an internationally successful author (which Johannes becomes in adult life) to the daughter of a minor nobleman would not have raised too many eyebrows in society. Although Victoria's family are aristocratic, however, they are not wealthy; indeed, they are in desperate financial straits and need to secure a financially advantageous marriage for their daughter to re-establish their fortunes and to restore the Castle, as their crumbling manor-house is called. She is therefore pressurised, much against her will, to become engaged to Otto, the son of a wealthy official at the Royal Court, even though she does not love him. Johannes also enters into an unsuccessful engagement with another woman; only at the end of the novel, when it is too late, do Victoria and Johannes discover how much they mean to each other. <br />This could easily be the plot of a Hardy novel, but Hamsun tells this story in a style which is very different to Hardy's. Hardy's novels are generally complex, discursive and with a large cast of characters both major and minor. Victoria is a very short novel (at 170 pages much shorter than any of Hardy's), told in a simple and direct manner and concentrating very much on the two lovers. The other characters are not developed in any detail, with the partial exception of Otto, who is presented asan arrogant and unpleasant lout. <br />Although the story is told in a straightforward manner, this does not mean that the prose is plain or unadorned. Although this is a third-person narrative, the action is mostly seen from the viewpoint of the poet Johannes and narrated in an appropriately poetic style. (This, at least, is the effect of Oliver Stallybrass's translation; I do not speak Norwegian so I cannot compare it with the original). The lyricism of the writing complements the pathos of the loves' plight; the result is a book that can be compared to a jewel, small, but beautiful and highly polished.	2003-12-31
US	36348634	R1CM09UVSDEQME	0140447954	198612908	A Hero of Our Time (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Wicked Irony: An Anti-Hero for All Time	This was Lermontov's only novel, published a year before his death in a duel at the age of 27. Although it was written in the late 1830s, it is strikingly modern both in its structure and in its treatment of the hero. <br />In structure, the book consists of a collection of short stories and novellas rather than a single narrative. These stories, however, are linked in two ways. Firstly, all feature the same protagonist, Grigoriy Pechorin, a young officer serving with the Russian army in the Caucasus. Secondly, they are bound together by a complex framework featuring a single anonymous narrator (not to be identified with Lermontov himself), a traveller in the Caucasus. The first story, Bela, is supposedly told to this narrator by Maksim Maksimych, a brother-officer of Pechorin. The second, Maksim Maksimych, is related by the narrator himself and deals with a meeting between Pechorin and Maksim. The other three, Taman, Princess Mary and The Fatalist, are all told in Pechorin's own words, taken from his journal which has come into the narrator's hands after Pechorin's death. <br />It is the fourth tale, Princess Mary, which is the longest and the one which lies at the heart of the work. Bela and Taman are adventure stories with an exotic setting (the Caucasus had the same sort of appeal for nineteenth-century Russians as India had for their British contemporaries). Maksim Maksimych is a linking narrative, and the final story, The Fatalist is an unsettling, spooky treatment of the concepts of fate and predestination. <br />In Princess Mary, the mood changes abruptly from the romantic exoticism of the earlier stories. Pechorin is stationed in a fashionable spa town in the northern Caucasus. Here he has little to occupy his time, and becomes embroiled in liaisons with two women, the Mary of the title (the daughter of an aristocratic family), and Vera, a former mistress of his, now unhappily married to an older husband. As a result of these intrigues, Pechorin quarrels with Grushnitsky, a rival for Mary's affections, and the story culminates in a duel between the two men. <br />The loose, episodic structure of the novel must have seemed very radical to readers in the first half of the nineteenth century. Lermontov also seems to prefigure later developments in the novel in his treatment of the character of Pechorin, a cynical, amoral figure who does not conform to the normal nineteenth idea of a literary \\"hero\\". This may make the title of the book seem ironic. Lermontov himself recognises this when he invents a dialogue between his narrator and his imaginary readers. The narrator says that the title of the book would be his reply should anyone ask him for his opinion of Pechorin's character. \\"But that is wicked irony!\\" Lermontov imagines his readers replying, to which the narrator's only comment is \\"I don't know.....\\". The suggestion is thereby given that the title can be taken both in an ironic sense and also at face value. <br />In a limited sense, Pechorin can indeed be seen as a heroic figure. A common usage of the word \\"hero\\" (possibly its original usage) is a person of great bravery, and there is no doubt that, in his duel with Grushnitsky, Pechorin shows both physical courage and indifference to death. What he lacks is the moral stature of the true hero in the unqualified sense of the word. We may admire someone who shows courage in order to help others, or in the service of his country, or in defence of a moral principle. Although this is difficult for us to understand today, people in the nineteenth century (or at least the upper classes from which Lermontov came) may also have admired someone who was prepared to risk death in defence of his honour or the honour of a loved one. What does not seem admirable, either from the perspective of the nineteenth century or from that of the twenty-first, is a contempt for death arising out of boredom with life, and it is this boredom which is the motivation for many of Pechorin's actions. His pursuit of Mary and Vera (like his earlier relationship with the Caucasian girl Bela) is born not of love or affection for the women involved, or even of sexual desire, but rather of a lack of anything better with which to occupy himself. He fights the duel with Grushnitsky not out of a belief that some things are worth dying for, but rather out of a belief that nothing is worth living for. <br />If Pechorin is not a conventional hero, neither is he a conventional literary villain in the sense of a brutal or Machiavellian evildoer, whose evil serves as a contrast to the virtue of the hero or heroine. Although there is something demonic about him in the way he brings misery to others, he is not wholly evil. A surprising side of his character brought out in his journals is his sensitivity to the beauty of nature; vivid descriptions of Caucasian scenery alternate with details of squalid intrigues. This is more than the stock Romantic cliché about wild characters being drawn to wild scenery; Lermontov uses these passages to suggest that even Pechorin sometimes aspires to a better way of life. After the literally breathtaking description of his duel with Grushnitsky, Pechorin concludes the story of Princess Mary with an unexpectedly poetic image, comparing himself to a mariner who has become so used to storm and strife that he cannot abide a peaceful life ashore and who paces the beach, watching for the sail that will take him back to sea. <br />Although there are similar characters in Romantic fiction, such as Pushkin's Onegin, the restless, cynical Pechorin can also be seen as prefiguring the \\"outsider\\" anti-heroes of the literature of the mid-twentieth century. (Camus's Meursault and Osborne's Jimmy Porter are examples that come to mind). More than a century and a half after his creation, Pechorin still seems a very modern figure; an anti-hero for our times as much as his own. I finished the book with only two regrets; firstly, that Lermontov's untimely deathprevented him from writing any more novels, and secondly that there do not currently seem to be any English versions of his poetry in print.	2003-12-11

In his interesting introduction to the book, Nabokov states that his original working title was \\"Romanticheskiy Vek\\", or \\"Romantic Times\\"; this was later changed to \\"Podvig\\", which can be translated as \\"gallant feat\\" or \\"exploit\\". <br />The hero of the book is Martin Edelweiss, a young Russian of Swiss ancestry. Like Nabokov's own family, Martin and his mother are forced to leave Russia following the Communist revolution of 1917, and take refuge in Switzerland, where Martin's mother marries his Uncle Henry, a cousin of his late father. Martin is sent to be educated in Cambridge; after graduating, he refuses to find a profession for himself, but travels around Europe, taking casual employment in Berlin and the south of France. The book ends with Martin performing the \\"exploit\\" of the Russian title, a clandestine crossing of the Soviet border from Latvia, but the ultimate outcome of this deed is left obscure. <br />Nabokov's two Russian titles for the work are both significant. Martin is a man of artistic temperament but without artistic gifts. He is bored and restless, something he has in common with the \\"superfluous men\\" of earlier Russian literature, such as Eugene Onegin or Pechorin from Lermontov's \\"Hero of our Times\\" (a novel Nabokov translated). (There is also, possibly, an echo of their obsession with duelling and honour in the rather ridiculous boxing match between Martin and his Cambridge friend Darwin). There are, however, important differences between Martin and these earlier anti-heroes. Their restlessness and boredom lead them into cynical, callous nihilism; Martin's lead him into a search for sense of purpose, something he remains optimistic about finding. As another reviewer has put it, he sees life as a \\"series of romantic possibilities.\\" Whereas their sense of purposelessness is internal, arising from something in their characters, Martin's is external, deriving from his situation as an involuntary exile, cut off from his country by political events. It is notable that when he goes to Cambridge he chooses to study Russian literature and culture, rejecting Henry's advice that he should follow a vocational course. Memories of his childhood take on great importance for him; he chooses, for example, to live and work for a time in a particular French town because of the (mistaken) belief that it was the town whose lights he once briefly glimpsed during a night-time train ride as a boy.   <br />Although the story is told in the third person, it is similar to a first-person narrative in that the whole of the action (except the last few pages after he has disappeared) is told as it appears to the central character. One of the most striking features of the work is the vividness of its descriptions of the physical world. Whether the scene is set in the Crimea, Greece, Switzerland, Cambridge, Berlin or Provence, there are plentiful references (at times in almost every sentence) to not only the sights of the locality but also to its sounds, smells, tastes and sensations. Martin is highly sensitive to the beauty of the world around him (something else, incidentally, that he shares with Pechorin)- lights seem from a train, the moon shining on the sea, a jay flying through blue sky above a snow-covered forest, or the scents of a Crimean summer. <br />Because Martin is so much at the centre of the book, the other characters are less prominent, although there are one or two sharp portraits- Uncle Henry, whose cautious pragmatism contrasts with Martin's romanticism, Martin's first love, the married Decadent poetess Alla Chernosvitova, Sonia Zilanova, the fickle, flirtatious daughter of another émigré family with whom he later conducts an on-off romance, and Darwin. (Darwin, incidentally, is not a fop, as some have called him. \\"Fop\\" seems an odd word to use about a winner of the Victoria Cross, and heoften seems more practical and down to earth than Martin himself).    <br />The motivation for Martin's \\"gallant feat\\" is left as obscure as its outcome. Was it some secret mission on behalf of his fellow émigrés? A desire for adventure? An attempt to impress Sonia? Nostalgia for his native land? Simple bravado? Nabokov provides no definitive answer to this question. Unlike some other reviewers, however, I did not find that the book was spoilt for me by the deliberately vague ending. In literature, as in life, mystery and ambiguity can be as interesting as precision and hard fact. Certainly, \\"Glory\\" is not a novel of the traditional sort, with a well-rounded plot with a beginning, a middle and an end, and should not be read as such. The fun of \\"Glory\\" lies elsewhere (to quote its author in a different context). The sensuous prose and the memorable portrait of a romantic young man in an age when romanticism was perhaps not in fashion make this a superb novel.	2003-12-05

He was a senior government official with responsibility for the Navy (the biggest spending government department in his day), a Member of Parliament, on speaking terms with two kings (Charles II and James II), President of the Royal Society and an Elder Brother of Trinity House. It is not, however, any of these achievements which have made him a household name, but rather his famous diary, which gives us such a vivid picture of both his life and his times. Had he not kept a diary, it is unlikely that his name would be known today except to historians of the seventeenth century navy and to those who are, like me, members of Magdalene College, Cambridge. (Pepys was a student at the college and its best-known benefactor; one of the college buildings is named after him). <br />This presents a problem to any biographer of Pepys. Although he lived for seventy years, from 1633 to 1703, his diary covers only the nine years between 1660 and 1669. (He abandoned it because of fears about his eyesight). We therefore know a great deal about a period covering just under one seventh of his total lifespan, and much less about the remaining six sevenths.  As might be expected, therefore, this book covers the 1660s in much greater detail than it does the rest of his life. <br />Fortunately, that decade, the decade of the Restoration, the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London, was not only one of the most eventful in English history, but also the most important in Pepys's life, as it saw him rise from a minor clerk in government service to being a high official of the State. One of the main attractions of the diary, however, is that it deals with Pepys's private affairs (including matters that show him in a bad light), not merely with his official duties, and Ms Tomalin does not neglect this colourful side of his life. The portrait that emerges is one of a complex, contradictory figure. On the one hand, Pepys was a highly competent and hard working civil servant; on the other, he had little compunction about accepting bribes. Married to a beautiful young wife, to whom he professed devotion, he kept two long-term mistresses (Betty Martin and Mrs Bagwell) and was always ready to attempt the seduction of any other attractive woman who crossed his path. To some of his friends he showed great kindness; others he treated badly. In private, he could be disrespectful about his royal masters, yet in public he remained steadfastly loyal, even when it would have been in his interest to be otherwise. (Pepys's public career ended when he remained loyal to James II after the revolution of 1688 and refused to swear allegiance to the new King William III).<br />When dealing with the years 1633-60 and 1669-1703, especially the earlier period, Ms Tomalin has less material to work with. Nevertheless, she succeeds in giving a good overall account of the course of Pepys's life, as well as an entertaining portrait of the times in which he lived. That period, for the modern reader, can be as contradictory as the man himself; at times the men and women of the seventeenth century seem surprisingly modern, at others they bear out the truth of the dictum about the past being another country where they do things differently. <br />I was surprised, for example, by the description of Pepys's operation for a kidney stone; seventeenth century medical knowledge and surgical techniques were clearly more advanced than I had realised. The period was also one of greater social mobility than we are often led to believe; Pepys's father was not (as I had wrongly thought) part of the landed gentry but a poor London tailor. His first cousin Edward Montagu, however, was a wealthy and influential landowning magnate, made an earl by Charles II for the part he played in the Restoration.    <br />The religious and political struggles of the time, however, can often seem very alien from a modern viewpoint. Even when we understand them at an intellectual level, it can be difficult to have much sympathy with either side. The traditional Whig interpretation of history, of course, viewed the period as marking the birth of English constitutional liberty, but this seems today to be, at best, a half-truth. Certainly, Charles II and James II can appear at times as quasi-mediaeval despots, trying vainly to hold on to their arbitrary power in the face of a nascent democracy. At others, however, they seem more like enlightened philosopher kings, defending toleration and liberty of conscience against a parliament of bigots who valued no freedom more highly than the freedom to persecute others. (It may have been this aspect of their character that inspired Pepys's loyalty to the Stuart dynasty; he shared a certain religious scepticism with Charles, although not with James who was a devout Catholic).  <br />It is to Ms Tomalin's credit that she contents herself with giving the political background to Pepys's career and does not try to advance one historical interpretation at the expense of another (even though her subject was himself very much a Tory). This is, in fact, in many ways a fair, well-balanced book that I can recommend to anyone who is seeking an introduction to the colourful life of Samuel Pepys or who has an interest in seventeenth century history.	2003-11-27

Miles confides to Bendrix that he suspects his attractive young wife, Sarah, of having an affair, and that he has considered having her watched by a private detective. Miles is unaware that Bendrix himself was Sarah's lover for several years, although she broke off the affair without explanation in 1944. <br />Bendrix, who has been tortured by jealousy ever since Sarah ended their affair, and who suspects her of having abandoned him for another lover, instructs a private detective himself to watch her and to obtain her diary. From this he discovers that the truth is stranger than he had thought. During a bombing raid, Bendrix was knocked unconscious when his house was struck by a V1 flying bomb. Believing him to be dead or fatally injured, Sarah (who was baptised as a Catholic but has never previously had any religious faith) finds herself making a vow that she will end her relationship with him if God will let him live. When she realises that Bendrix has only suffered minor injuries, Sarah believes that she must fulfil what she has vowed, even though does not know whether she believes in God. <br />Several of Greene's other novels deal with the moral dilemmas confronting those who are already believing Catholics. Characters such as the \\"whisky priest\\" in The Power and the Glory and Scobie in The Heart of the Matter can be seen as being in search of a God in whom they believe, yet who seems to elude them. In The End of the Affair, by contrast, God is in search of Sarah, although she attempts (like Francis Thompson in his poem) to flee from Him. She is very much in love with Bendrix, and her marriage to the dull and cold Henry is a dead, loveless one. She therefore tries to convince herself that God does not exist, believing that, if there is no God, a vow made to Him is not binding on her, and that she can resume her affair with Bendrix with a clear conscience. She befriends Richard Smythe, a militant atheist whom she hears making an impassioned diatribe against religion from a soapbox on the common. In a series of meetings he lectures her on the falsity of all religious doctrines, but these have the opposite effect to that intended. The more Smythe tries to persuade her (and the more she tries to persuade herself), the more she comes to believe in God's existence. Moreover, she realises that Smythe himself (whose rage against God arises from his having been born with a disfiguring birthmark) is, in his heart, a believer. True, his is an angry and resentful belief, but anger and resentment are meaningless unless there exists a being against whom they can be directed. <br />The geometry of the novel is more complex than a love-triangle or even than the love-quadrilateral which was suggested by another reviewer. A more accurate analogy would be with an irregular, and variable, pentagon. The five corners of the pentagon are Sarah, Henry, Bendrix, Smythe (who falls in love with Sarah) and God, separated by metaphorical distances that shrink or lengthen as the novel progresses. <br />All the characters in this novel are flawed, but none is unsympathetic. Greene (both in this novel and more generally in his work) has a great talent for eliciting sympathy and understanding for his characters despite (or because of) their human weaknesses. This is true of the three main characters, Bendrix, Sarah and Henry, and also of lesser ones such as Smythe and Parkis, the private detective retained by Bendrix, who retains a certain dignity despite the seedy work in which he is employed. (Parkis was memorably portrayed by John Mills in the otherwise unmemorable 1955 film of the book; I have not seen the more recent film). It is because the characters are sympathetically portrayed that we can believe in their spiritual journey, as not only Sarah, but also Bendrix and Smythe, are drawn reluctantly towards God. <br />This is a short novel, of less than 200 pages, but in that short space Greene is able to explore in some depth not only the complexities of human emotions (Thompson's phrase about \\"labyrinthine ways\\" seems particularly apt) but also philosophical issues relating to faith and the existence of God. An excellent book.	2003-11-08
US	36348634	R2R976TKDDN8D1	0679734058	365281145	Killing Mister Watson	Books	4	40	41	N	Y	Murder in the Wild South	As the title implies, this is the story of a murder, one committed in the Florida Everglades in 1910. The book opens with a description of the death of Edgar J Watson, a pioneer homesteader, at the hands of a mob of his neighbours, who believe him to have been responsible for a number of killings that have taken place in the area. It then proceeds to tell Watson's story through the eyes of those who knew him, each chapter being related by a different narrator to the previous one. Interspersed with these are a number of brief chapters related by the author himself, assuming the role of a historian trying to find out the truth about what he calls the \\"Watson legend\\". (Watson was, in fact, a real person, and, although this is a work of fiction, it is based around historical events.) <br />The one voice we do not hear in the course of this novel is that of Watson himself; he is always referred to in the third person, never in the first. As a result of Mr Matthiessen's multiple-narrator technique, the truth about Watson's character and the events surrounding him, even those following his move to Florida, remains ambiguous. (We hear rumours, but no direct testimony, about his previous life in several other states). Was Watson good or evil, or a mixture of the two? Was his death the work of a vindictive lynch mob or justifiable killing in self-defence? Was he really guilty of the murders attributed to him, or the victim of unjustified suspicion? Mr Matthiessen never gives a final answer to these questions, but allows the reader to decide for himself or herself. Certainly, the various narrators disagree among themselves; while some clearly hate Watson, others point to his good qualities- his love for his family, his capacity for hard work, his honesty in his business dealings. Although this is the story of a murder, it bears little resemblance to the conventional whodunit, in which there is always a Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple to act as deus ex machina and to reveal thetruth to the reader and to the other characters. Rather, it is more similar to a real-life crime, in which all concerned, be they witnesses, police officers, prosecutor, defender, judge and jury have to try to make sense of a mass of conflicting evidence and testimony.  <br />The air of ambiguity with which Mr Matthiessen invests his narrative would, in some books, be a weakness; here, it is a strength. By allowing his characters to tell the story in their own words, with no omniscient narrator to give the definitive version of events, he is able to achieve a greater depth and complexity than would be possible with a conventional third-person narrative. Although Watson is an enigmatic character, he is nevertheless a powerfully-drawn and memorable one. <br />Equally powerful is the description of the novel's setting. The dense, steamy, low-lying mangrove forests and swamps which made up much of Southern Florida in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were very different geographically to the high plains, deserts and mountains of the Wild West, but in cultural terms they had much in common. Both had only recently been settled by white settlers, who brought with them a culture that incorporated much of the best and the worst in American society. The best- the virtues of independence, self-reliance and hard work. The worst- the lawlessness, the obsession with honour, the willingness to settle all disputes at gunpoint, the racialism directed against both blacks and Indians. Florida today may be America's vacationland; a hundred years ago, it was the Wild South, the last remaining frontier on the east coast, a place where man was not yet in full control, where Watson and those like him struggled to make a living in the face of a hostile nature. (A hurricane plays an important part in the final turn of events in the book). <br />In this book, Mr Matthiessen has succeeded in the creation of a highly believable fictional world, with a fascinating character at its centre. A novel well worth reading.	2003-10-16
US	36348634	R2ET0LUQKJDTJ7	0007154615	958226210	Unless: A Novel	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Goodness! Gracious! Great Balls of Fire!	There can be few works of literature whose title consists solely of a single conjunction. (Kipling's &quot;If&quot; is probably the most famous). The word &quot;unless&quot; here refers to Ms Shields's theory that human life, like the English language is held together by a few linking words (conjunctions, adjectives and prepositions such as &quot;unless&quot;, &quot;although&quot;, &quot;nevertheless&quot;) which are meaningless in themselves but which gain importance by what they join together).   <br />The narrator and central character of this novel is Reta Winters, a middle-aged writer living in a small town near Toronto with her husband and two of her three daughters. Although Reta would appear to have a comfortable middle-class life, the family faces a crisis when their eldest daughter, Norah, drops out of university and goes to live on the streets of Toronto as a beggar, holding a sign with the single word \\"GOODNESS\\". The reason why only becomes clear at the very end of the book; for most of the time, both the reader and her family are left in the dark. Not only are Reta and her family unable to understand Norah's behaviour, they are also unable to change it. Norah is legally an adult, and not of unsound mind, so she cannot be compelled to return to her family, and their attempts to persuade her to do so or to reason with her are met with silence. <br />Unable to alter the situation, the family have to get on with their lives as best they can, and much of the book is taken up with descriptions of the defence mechanisms they use to cope with Norah's loss. Her two younger sisters Natalie and Christine get on with their everyday school lives, Tom returns to his work and to his all-consuming hobby, the study of fossil trilobites (which means more to him than his day-job as a doctor), and Reta continues with her round of housework, meetings with friends and work on her latest novel. <br />As one would expect, however, Reta continues to be preoccupied with Norah and tries desperately to understand her. The family come up with various theories- problems with her boyfriend, academic difficulties at university, some unknown trauma- but the explanation which comes to obsess Reta is intimately tied to her own feminist views. Reta believes that Norah has dropped out of a male-dominated society which denies women the chance to achieve \\"greatness\\". Deprived of this opportunity, Norah is forced to pursue the only alternative, \\"goodness\\", which she is seeking through renunciation of the world. Reta elaborates this theory in a series of letters written to various authors and journalists whom she considers to have undervalued the role of women. (In the end, however, she never posts any of these letters). <br />Unlike some reviewers, I did not see \\"Unless\\" as \\"feminist rant\\", or even as a feminist work at all. Indeed, it seems quite possible that Ms Shields wrote it as a subtle critique of feminism, or to be more accurate of the ideological tunnel vision to which certain types of feminism (and certain other viewpoints) can lead. By \\"ideological tunnel vision\\", I mean the tendency to see all misfortunes as being caused by the one single phenomenon against which one's ideology is directed. As a feminist, Reta blames Norah's condition on male dominance of society, but if she had been a Marxist, she would no doubt have blamed capitalist oppression of the working class. A Freudian would have blamed neuroses arising from psychosexual traumas in childhood, a Christian fundamentalist would have blamed the godlessness of modern society and a militant atheist would have blamed the baleful influence of religion. A flat-earther would probably have blamed the persistence of the illogical belief in a round world. Without wanting to give away the ending of the novel, I can say that when the truth about Norah becomes known, it has nothing to do with Reta's feminist theories.        <br />Ms Shields can write well, and some parts of the book are very effective, particularly Reta's memories of her own childhood, and the satirical portrait of her pushy, gushing literary editor Arthur Springer. Nevertheless, the book as a whole is rather static, with little development either of plot or of character. Too much of the book is taken up with the minutiae of Reta's everyday life, and her meetings with her various friends, none of whom emerge as interesting characters in their own right. Indeed, apart from Springer and Reta herself, none of the characters are particularly memorable, even Norah, around whom the plot turns. (At the risk of sounding like Springer, who wants to rewrite Reta's latest novel for her, I felt that the book might have been made more interesting if it had been told from Norah's point of view or using a multiple-narrator technique). <br />Even if the book is seen as a novel of ideas, Ms Shields does not develop her themes as fully as she might. Although Reta spends much of her time musing on \\"goodness\\", there is no serious exploration of the theme of what it means to live a good, in the sense of virtuous, life. The point is not, for example, made that in some cultures (especially Hindu and Buddhist ones), to renounce worldly goods and concentrate on spiritual matters while living off the charity of others would be regarded as a deeply virtuous act, whereas in the West, although it has its own hermitic traditions, \\"goodness\\" is more often equated with service to one's fellow-men. Given that the novel revolves around Norah's apparent decision to seek \\"goodness\\" through renunciation, I felt that more could have been made of these two contrasting concepts of virtue.	2003-10-02
US	36348634	R30PK8KTP0HYBY	0679765018	298470233	Feast of July	Books	4	24	25	N	N	A Neglected Master	H E Bates is an author whose reputation has declined somewhat in recent years. During his lifetime, and for about two decades after his death in 1974, he was one of the most popular authors in Britain. Interest in him reached a peak in the early 1990s when his \\"Larkin Family\\" novels were serialised on television. In my view, those are far from being his best works, but the series was a huge success, tapping as it did into a vein of rural nostalgia and introducing to public view the most beautiful young actress that Britain has produced for many years. Since then, however, that interest has declined and, apart from the Larkin books and one or two wartime stories, his works are now largely out of print.<br />I had thought that \\"The Feast of July\\" was one of those neglected works, and was pleased to see it is still in print. Its setting is a small town in the East Midlands, probably during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. The mood, however, is not one of nostalgia. Like Hardy's \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\", the book deals with a young unmarried mother who is abandoned by her seducer and whose child dies in infancy. While searching for her lover, the heroine, Bella Ford, arrives as a homeless and friendless stranger in town, where she is rescued and befriended by Ben Wainwright, a shoemaker, and his family. (Shoemaking is the principal industry of the area). Bella is welcomed into the family and becomes like a daughter to them, especially after their own daughter dies. Ben and his wife have three sons, and, after brief dalliances with the two younger boys, she eventually finds love with the eldest, Con. The climax of the story comes on the Feast of July, a traditional festival in the area, celebrating the first crops of the new season. Bella's lover Arch Wilson reappears in her life, provoking a confrontation that ends tragically.<br />The novel is reminiscent of Hardy in more ways than one. There is the book's late Victorian/Edwardian setting (although it was not written until the 1950s). There is the triangular relationship between Bella, Con and Arch, which parallels that between Tess, Angel and Alec. Most importantly, there is Bates's deep love of the countryside, which he shares with the earlier writer. Although the Wainwrights live in an industrial town, it is small enough for the surrounding countryside to be an inescapable presence in the lives of its inhabitants. The Feast, second only to Christmas in importance in the area, is celebrated by town and country dwellers alike, and the townspeople are expected to set aside their normal work to join in the harvest. Throughout the book we are made aware of the changing of the seasons; most of the chapters start with a reference to the time of year, to the weather and to the changing landscape. (Winter, when the demand for shoes is depressed, is a time of hardship even for industrial workers). As in many of Bates's other novels, the beauty of countryside in its changing moods is described with what the Times Literary Supplement described as \\"lyrical intensity\\".<br />It would be wrong to see this novel as merely a pastiche of Victorian writing. Bates's style is terse and urgent, rather than the more discursive style favoured in nineteenth century literature. As a result, this is a brief novel of about 200 pages; a Victorian novelist dealing with this theme would in all likelihood have done so at much greater length. This brevity of style has its drawbacks. The characters are less developed than they would have been in a longer work; Arch Wilson, in particular, is a two-dimensional figure, a plot device rather than a believable character (whereas Alec d'Urberville emerges as a complex and credible human being). Nevertheless, brevity has its advantages as well. By concentrating on the essentials, Bates develops his plot with a speed and urgency that gives the impression of events rushing to a headlong climax and makes the culminating tragedy seem all the more terribleand inevitable.<br />This, then, is a fine piece of writing, evidence that Bates deserves to be remembered as more than the creator of the dreary Larkin clan and as the man who unwittingly gave her big break to Catherine Zeta Jones. Let us hope that the recent decision by ITV to repeat The Darling Buds of May will lead to a revival of interest in Bates generally. The publishers could help by reissuing some of his other novels (Love for Lydia, The Distant Horns of Summer and The Jacaranda Tree are examples that come to mind).le and inevitable. <br />This, then, is a fine piece of writing, evidence that Bates deserves to be remembered as more than the creator of the dreary Larkin clan and as the man who unwittingly gave her big break to Catherine Zeta Jones.

A member of an ethnic minority community, wrongly accused of a serious crime, faces prejudice from the white majority but is defended by a liberal white lawyer. The action takes place on San Piedro, a small island in the Pacific North-West, in 1954. The island's inhabitants are mostly white, but there is a sizeable Japanese community. A young Japanese-American fisherman, Kabuo Miyamoto, is accused of the murder of a white man, Carl Heine, and it is his trial that lies at the centre of the action. (The alleged motive is a long-standing family dispute about land). <br />Intertwined with this story is a second familiar plot, the Romeo and Juliet theme of two lovers from opposite sides of a divided community. In a series of flashbacks, we learn that Miyamoto's wife, Hatsue, was before her marriage romantically involved with a white boy, Ishmael Chambers, the son of the editor of the local newspaper. The romance, however, ended after Pearl Harbour, when Ishmael was drafted into the armed forces and Hatsue, along with her family and the rest of the Japanese community, was sent to an internment camp on the mainland. Hatsue's mother found out about the relationship and compelled her to write to Ishmael ending it.   <br />At the heart of the novel is an analysis of the nature of prejudice. Relations between the white and Japanese communities have never been easy, but they are worsened by the attack on Pearl Harbour and by the subsequent internment of the Japanese. This is not the murderous, lynch-mob mentality of the old South (there are few racially-motivated incidents worse than vandalism or shouted abuse), but rather a continuous underlying suspicion and distrust that poisons the atmosphere and makes normal relationships impossible. <br />Although plenty of whites hate the Japanese, Guterson makes it quite clear that racism is not a white monopoly and that the Japanese community has its own racist elements. The most bigoted Japanese character is Hatsue's mother Fujiko, who pledges her loyalty to America, but in her heart despises white Americans and their culture, which she regards as inferior and spiritually corrupting. The two communities may attend the same schools and work at the same trades (most islanders are either fishermen or strawberry farmers), and there are occasional same-sex friendships, but there are few other points of contact between them. Inter-racial love and marriage are particularly frowned upon, especially from the Japanese point of view. (Japanese girls are taught to beware of \\"lustful\\" white men, just as girls in the South were taught to view every black male as a potential rapist). Contrary to what some reviewers have thought, therefore, it is easy to realise why Hatsue deserts Ishmael; by falling in love with him, she has violated one of her society's deepest taboos. To have continued the relationship, in defiance of her parents' wishes, would have meant cutting herself off not only from her family but also from the wider Japanese community which, in the internment camp, is all she has to cling to. <br />One of the most pernicious effects of racism is the way it destroys trust by making people see prejudice where none exists. Ishmael wrongly assumes that Hatsue has abandoned him out of anti-white feelings. Many whites see all Japanese as potential traitors, even those like Miyamoto who have served with the American army. Most seriously of all, Miyamoto is responsible for his own misfortune in that he brings suspicion on himself by first concealing, then lying about, the circumstances of Heine's death; he assumes that whatever a Japanese says will not be believed by the whites. His defence lawyer, Nels Gudmundsson, tries, probably mistakenly, to make race an issue at the trial by ignoring his client's lies and attributing racist motives to the police and prosecution.<br />The estrangement of the two communities, however, goes deeper than simple prejudice. Although there are tolerant figures in the white community, such as Gudmundsson and Ishmael's parents, their tolerance arises out of a belief that, give or take a few quaint old-country customs such as tea ceremonies and ceremonial stick-fighting, the Japanese are loyal to the same values as the whites. The liberals are unaware of quite genuine cultural differences which could give rise to conflicts of loyalties. The main Japanese criticisms of whites are that they place too much emphasis on individualism (which the Japanese see as egoism) and that they are unwilling to accept misfortune stoically. Yet a belief in the value of the individual and a belief that one can improve one's lot- and the lot of others- by battling against misfortune are two of the key tenets of Western democracy. The Japanese ideal of \\"bowing to the wind\\", by contrast, can easily be used to justify unquestioning obedience to authority, whether it be the authority of a warmongering emperor and his generals or that of domineering parents.  <br />The climax of the story comes when Ishmael, who has succeeded his father as editor, finds evidence that could establish Miyamoto's innocence. He, however, is still embittered both by the loss of an arm while fighting the Japanese and by the failure of his romance with Hatsue, and hesitates to reveal it, thinking that if Miyamoto is hanged as a murderer that romance may yet be rekindled. The ending of the book is not particularly satisfactory, as Guterson places too much emphasis on Ishmael's supposed dilemma. (In moral terms, of course, there is no dilemma: do you save an innocent man from the gallows or do you let him hang in the hope of gain to yourself? You don't need a first in moral philosophy to realise that there is only one answer to that question). Despite the predictable and disappointing ending, however, there is much to enjoy in the book, such as its analysis of a divided community or the lyrical descriptions of the island's scenery which form the backdrop to the love story of Ishmael and Hatsue. Overall, a very good first novel, and considerably better than the film.	2003-08-08

In her teens, she was one of America's female swimmers and, but for the outbreak of World War 2, would have competed in the 1940 Olympics. She was then persuaded to sign a contract with MGM by Louis B Mayer and over the next fifteen years she starred in a series of movies which centred around spectacular swimming-pool sequences. Her career, however, was damaged when in 1955 she walked out on her MGM contract rather than appear in The Opposite Sex as the studio wanted. She made a few more non-swimming pictures in the late 50s and early 60s, but these only confirmed Mayer's famous view that \\"Wet, she's a star; dry, she ain't\\". In 1961 she gave up her film career altogether.    <br />There can be few film stars who have written an autobiography nearly forty years after making their last film, and Miss Williams has set herself the difficult task of interesting her readers in events which took place so long ago. Largely, she succeeds. There are several reasons for this. The first is that although the book is ghostwritten, Miss Williams's ghostwriter, Digby Diehl, writes with greater style and wit than most ghostwriters. The second is that because the events took place so long ago, many of those concerned are now dead and she can therefore write with greater candour than the libel laws would otherwise allow her. The third is that she balances her account of her professional activities with a vivid portrait of her private life.<BR> <BR>The contrast between public and private life is probably the book's greatest strength. In business affairs, she was a tough and determined young woman, ever ready to fight her corner against bullying or sexually predatory studio executives. In her private life, she seems to have had much greater difficulties. After a brief unsatisfactory first marriage, she married a musician named Ben Gage. Were this a work of fiction, the drunken, idle, dishonest, gambling-addicted, childish and irresponsible Gage would qualify as a great comic character; in real life, such a man must have been virtually impossible to live with. The wonder is not that the marriage ended in divorce, but rather that it lasted for fourteen years. <br />Esther's third marriage was rather more successful, although it is difficult to understand why. Fernando Lamas, an Argentine film star. was conceited, vain and sex-obsessed. Worse still, he refused  to have anything to do with the children of her marriage to Gage, with the result that they had to live with their feckless father. He also insisted on her giving up her film career, and there is nothing in her account of their marriage which really explains why she stayed with him for twenty years until his death. <br />Despite the vivacity of Esther's narrative and the interesting light she sheds on the making of her films, some things in her book leave a bad impression, which is why I have not given it more than three stars. There is too much standard Hollywood gossip on the lines of \\"who-was sleeping-with-whom\\" and \\"who-had-what-vice\\", none of which is really enlightening. The revelations about Jeff Chandler's private life fall firmly into the category of things you never wanted to know about Hollywood but have been forced to find out. Esther certainly should not have repeated Lamas's insinuations that Lana Turner was responsible for the murder of her boyfriend now that Lana is no longer here to defend herself. <br />Miss Williams also occasionally seems insufficiently critical of her own behaviour and that of those close to her. She can find little wrong in Lamas's blackmail of his previous wife Arlene Dahl, for example, or in her accepting the hospitality of General Franco, or in her sarcastic gesture in sending a deliberately cheap and tacky bouquet of flowers to Joan Crawford who was going through a severe crisis of self-confidence atthe time. <br />The book is also occasionally philistine in tone. Miss Williams is so keen to defend her own films from the charge of being mere \\"fluff\\" that she tends to undervalue films made with a serious purpose or on a small budget. The Red Badge of Courage, one of the finest war films ever made, is dismissed as a \\"grim little message film\\", although she probably disliked it because it was made by Dore Schary, a studio executive she loathed. The Opposite Sex is no cinematic masterpiece, but it does not fall so far beneath the artistic standards of the average Esther Williams movie as to make worthwhile the loss of the $3 million in deferred contract payments which she forfeited by refusing to do it. <br />Esther points out that, in their day, her films did better at the box office than those starring MGM's other big female stars, Lana Turner, Ava Gardner and Deborah Kerr. Unfortunately, the claim that there is no arguing with the box office loses force with the passage of time, and time has been kinder to those ladies than to her. Fifty years on, some at least of their movies are regarded as classics, while hers are little more than cheesy curiosities. Whatever else they may have been, however, there is no denying that her movies were unique. Even while she was at MGM, no other studio tried to imitate them, and since her retirement, although choreographed water ballet has made a curious move to the sporting arena (Esther claims the title of \\"godmother of synchronised swimming\\"), it has vanished from the cinema screen. Yet there is a modern parallel. Action largely taking place in the water, limited intellectual depth combined with glossy production values and tricksy camera work, family entertainment with plenty of shots of attractive girls in swimsuits? Could Esther also be the godmother of Baywatch?	2003-07-15

On the one hand, it has been celebrated as the repository of all that is best in the American national character. On the other, it has long been a standard literary and Hollywood cliché that the more idyllic and tranquil a small town appears on the surface, the more likely it is to prove to be a place of rampant corruption, raging hatreds and illicit sexual passions. This cliché was at its height in the 1940s and 1950s in films such as King's Row and Peyton Place, and is still to be found even today; Mr Keillor's home state of Minnesota was recently the target of some particularly crude and ill-natured satire in the film Drop Dead Gorgeous. <br />Mr Keillor's book is set in the fictional small town of Lake Wobegon, Minnesota. It is not an easy book to categorise. It is certainly not a conventional novel, but rather consists of a spoof history of his fictional town, followed by a lengthy series of anecdotes and personal reminiscences set in and around it, organised either by theme or by the time of year when they take place. The author's intention seems to have been to give a realistic but humorous view of small-town life, avoiding the traps of portraying Lake Wobegon either as an earthly paradise or as a sink of depravity. Unfortunately, although he succeeds in avoiding these traps, he does not succeed in injecting much humour into his account of the town. The book has been described as \\"gently humorous\\": in this context, the adverb seems to be simply a euphemism for \\"not very\\". The fictional history of the town struck me as being particularly dull reading, lacking in either wit or satirical bite. (I have some sympathy with those readers who gave up reading the book in the first hundred pages or so). The remainder of the book improves somewhat, and there are some genuinely funny passages. (I enjoyed, for example, Mr Keillor's satire at the expense of the narrow, bigoted religious sectin which he grew up). These passages, unfortunately, are far between, and much of the intervening material is just padding. Besides the two stereotypes of small-town life quoted above, there is a third stereotypical view: that small towns are dull, boring places where nothing of any interest ever happens. This is a view that Mr Keillor has, perhaps inadvertently, perpetuated in this book.	2003-07-04
US	36348634	RPKWP1PURVX7Q	0679750185	147498198	The Cement Garden	Books	4	18	20	N	N	A Midsummer Nightmare: A Gothic Tale of Callaghan's Britain	This short novella deals with a similar theme to that of William Golding's Lord of the Flies, namely the behaviour of children and adolescents when free of the constraints of adult behaviour. Four siblings from a working-class family - Jack, the teenaged narrator, his older sister Julie, younger sister Sue and the youngest, Tom- are orphaned by the death of their mother, their father having died about two years earlier. In order to stay together and avoid being put into the care of the local authority, they conceal their mother's death by hiding her body in a trunk, filling it with cement and leaving it in the cellar of their house. As it is the summer holidays, there is no school for them to attend, and they spend the long, hot days in idleness. Apart from Tom, who occasionally plays with boys from a nearby tower block, the youngsters avoid contact with the outside world, until Julie introduces an outsider into their home in the shape of her older boyfriend Derek. The final denouement arises as a result of the conflict between Julie's relationship with Derek and the growing incestuous feelings between her and Jack. <br />The book was published in 1978 and, although there are no explicit period references, in many ways it reflects the mood of Britain in the late seventies. That was a time of economic recession, of industrial unrest, of unemployment, of concern about declining public services and the condition of the inner cities. (The period also saw some of the hottest summers of recent decades).  The weak minority government of Prime Minister James Callaghan was widely perceived as being unable or unwilling to do anything about the country's problems. The era also saw a growing sense of youthful rebelliousness and resentment of adult authority which found its most extreme expression in the punk movement. Although a generation gap was not a new phenomenon, the mood of the young in the seventies was quite different to that of their older brothers and sisters in thesixties. Youthful rebellion in the hippy era often took the form of altruistic idealism, and even in its hedonistic forms tended to be joyous and optimistic. The rebellion of the young in the seventies, by contrast, tended to be more sour and resentful, characterised by a cynical pessimism. <br />The setting of the book is a bleak, impoverished district of an unnamed British inner city. The children's house is one of the few remaining in an area marked out for redevelopment, and is surrounded either by soulless tower blocks or by derelict, rubble-strewn wasteland. Their garden, one of the few islands of green in the area, has been concreted over by their father (hence the title of the book). A dustmen's' strike means that refuse is not being collected. There is a pervasive atmosphere of stifling heat and noxious odours. The children- Jack in particular- are cynical, apathetic and suspicious of the adult world in all its forms. Their independent life together has few positive attractions- its main features are boredom, squalor and quarrels- but they prefer it to the alternative of submitting to adult authority. The incestuous relationship between Jack and Julie can be seen as both the ultimate expression of family solidarity and as a conscious rejection of the taboos and conventions of the adult world. <br />A word that has been used by other reviewers about this book is \\"gothic\\". With two qualifications, that is a useful categorisation. The first qualification is that the so-called \\"gothic\\" movement in literature, a literature obsessed with death, darkness, gloom and despair, has very little connection with Gothic architecture, an architecture that celebrates life, light, colour and faith. The second qualification is that McEwan's work represents a modern development of the \\"gothic\\" tradition; he has abandoned the supernatural elements and exotic settings beloved of Georgian and Victorian gothic authors, but has retained their fascination with death, decay and the macabre and their emphasis on the darker side of human nature, including human sexuality, which can be treated with a greater freedom than was possible for earlier writers. (Besides the incest of Jack and Julie, Tom, the youngest child, who loves to dress as a girl, is presented as a budding transvestite). <br />McEwan's prose in this work is deliberately simple- the sentences are short, with few dependent clauses, and mostly describe concrete actions with little room for speculation or analysis of thoughts and feelings. (This is not surprising, given that it is narrated by a young boy of both limited education and limited experience). Despite the terseness of the prose and the desolate urban setting, however, this is not a work of social realism. If one tries to read it as realistic fiction, a number of details do not ring true. (Would the disappearance of the children's mother, for example, really have gone unnoticed by the outside world for so long, especially as she had been receiving medical treatment for her illness and had even arranged to go into hospital?) If, however, one reads it as a work of grim fantasy, it can be seen as an accomplished and powerful piece of work. The combination of matter-of-fact narration and bleak modern setting with macabre horror and bizarre happenings gives the work an eerie, hallucinatory quality; not so much a midsummer night's dream as a midsummer nightmare.	2003-07-02

Kosinskis book, however, is just as remarkable in its own right. <br />The hero of the book is Chance, a mentally retarded adult who works as the gardener at the home of a wealthy retired New York lawyer. During the whole of his adult life, Chance has never left the house and garden; his only contact with the outside world is through television, which he watches obsessively. His life changes, however, when his employer dies, the house is sold and he is forced to leave. Chance is slightly injured when he is hit by a car belonging to Elizabeth Eve (EE), the wife of Benjamin Rand, a rich and influential Wall Street financier and a friend of the President. EE, mishearing Chance the gardener as Chauncey Gardiner and mistakenly believing Chance to be a successful businessman, invites him to stay with her and her husband at their home. A series of misunderstandings leads all concerned to believe that Chance is not only a businessman but also an economic prophet. He is invited to speak on national television where he talks about the only thing he understands, gardening. A series of platitudes about the changing of the seasons in the garden is taken to be an extended metaphor forecasting an upturn in the economy, and his supposed optimism strikes a chord with the viewing public. The book ends with the elderly, terminally ill, Rand about to name Chance as his heir and successor, and the President about to nominate him as his vice-presidential running-mate. <br />The book is short, a novella rather than a novel, of around 100 pages. The style is direct, simple and like a fable. It has been interpreted as a satire on the role of television in the modern age or on the American political system. Those elements are certainly present and were emphasised more in the film than in the book. (In Britain the film was widely taken to be a direct attack onthe Reagan administration, even though it was actually made during the Carter years but not released here until after the presidential election). The significance of the book, however, is a deeper one. <br />In the film, Peter Sellers portrayed Chance as a lonely, pitiable character in late middle age, young only by comparison with his aged employer and the ageing Rand. It is an affecting performance, but subtly different from the Chance of Kosinskis book. Kosinskis Chance is relatively young, good-looking and emotionally detached from his surroundings. This detachment allows others to treat him as what in German would be called a Wunschbild, that is to say a picture of ones wishes, a blank canvas onto which one can paint ones own desires. Each of the other characters sees in the supposed Chauncey Gardiner whatever he or she wishes to see. Rand, who has no children with EE and who is estranged from the children of his first marriage, sees him as a potential successor to his business empire and almost as an adopted son. EE, sexually frustrated in a marriage to a much older man, sees him as a lover and a possible second husband after Rands death. The President sees him as the ideal candidate for Vice-President, a position he has been struggling to fill. The Soviet Ambassador to the UN sees him as a liberal, Russophile capitalist who will use his influence to further east-west relations. The American TV audience see him as the man who will lead them out of recession and into prosperity. <br />The book certainly is, in part, a commentary on the television age. It certainly is, in part, a political satire. (We can all think of politicians who have the ability to be all things to all men). Most importantly, however, it is a brilliant fable on the human capacity for self-delusion and for seeing others not for what they are but for what we would wish them to be.	2003-06-04

John Wheelwright is the illegitimate son of a daughter of the town's most illustrious family; Owen Meany is the son of a local quarry owner. The two boys have quite differing characters. John (the narrator) is quiet and shy; Owen, although short in stature and cursed with a loud, high-pitched and rasping voice, is confident and outgoing. <br />The central incident in the novel comes early on. John's mother is accidentally killed by a baseball struck by Owen during a Little League game. Despite this tragedy, the boys remain close friends, but Owen becomes convinced as a result that he is God's chosen instrument with some special purpose in life. This conviction remains with him throughout his life, and becomes the central theme of the book, as we follow John and Owen through their school and university days and into adult life. Without revealing too much of the plot, I can say that Owen's faith is vindicated and that he dies tragically but heroically, in a manner which he has, in part, foreseen. <br />This is a book which (perhaps unusually for a novel written in the last quarter of the twentieth century) treats religious faith seriously. John has become a non-believer following his mother's death, but is inspired by Owen's example to return to faith in God. The religious life of the community is a theme that runs throughout the book (there is, for example, a hilarious account of a school nativity play) and a local clergyman plays an important part in the development of the plot. The theme of religious faith, however, is balanced by another theme, that of war. In Britain, we tend to look back nostalgically on the sixties as the carefree era of the Beatles, Swinging London and free love. For Americans, however, there was a darker side to the decade in the shape of the Vietnam War, and throughout the latter part of the book the war isan inescapable presence, casting its shadow over all, especially the young. Owen helps John to escape the draft, but volunteers for military service himself in order to achieve what he sees as his ordained destiny. <br />Some other reviewers have complained that the book is too long. It is certainly a long book (about 630 pages in my edition), but there is little in it (apart, perhaps, from some of the Canadian scenes- in later life John is a schoolteacher in Canada) which I felt should have been cut. Perhaps episodes such as the nativity play and the accounts of Owen's battles with the headmaster of his school (surely the most obnoxious fictional headmaster since Wackford Squeers) are not strictly necessary in terms of plot development, but they are so brilliantly written that the book would be poorer without them. One criticism that is perhaps justified is that Mr Irving devotes too much time and energy to the Iran-Contra affair. My objection is not necessarily political - there was, after all, much to criticise in the Reagan administration's behaviour during that affair - but rather artistic, in that political analysis of a scandal from the eighties seems misplaced in a novel which is mainly about the fifties and sixties. <br />On the whole, however, I found this an excellent book. Mr Irving develops his characters with great skill. Owen himself is a particularly memorable character, but there are others who also stand out, such as John's eccentric cousin Hester, who later becomes Owen's girlfriend, John's kindly stepfather, Dan Needham and the doubt-ridden clergyman Lewis Merrill. The author also displays great skill in weaving together his various themes of faith, war and friendship to produce a book which is not only highly readable but also thought-provoking and (despite its serious subject matter) at times very funny.	2003-04-09

This is a stronger term than the mere \\"boredom\\" which is its literal meaning, because the word also implies a state of indifference and moral and spiritual deadness. It is a state of mind frequently invoked in Baudelaire's poetry, and one which is also at the centre of Joan Didion's novel.  <br />The central character is Maria Wyeth, a Hollywood actress in her early thirties. Fate has, in many ways, been unkind to her- her mother died in a car crash, her career is in trouble, her marriage to an uncaring husband is also failing and she has a mentally-handicapped daughter. Maria reacts by retreating into the sterile world occupied by most of the novel's other characters, one of casual and promiscuous sex, drink, drugs and \\"Ennui\\", both in its literal and its extended Baudelairean senses. <br />Told in a series of very short vignettes, the novel traces the progress of the disintegration of Maria's life. She is bullied into an abortion by her husband. (It is interesting that a novel by a woman writer treats abortion not as a woman's right but as another weapon of male dominance). Her marriage ends in divorce. In the final scene her moral nihilism means that she deliberately fails to prevent the suicide of a friend. <br />Much of the book is set in the deserts of southern California and Nevada, and Maria spends much of her time driving on long but aimless car journeys through this landscape. The imagery of the desert is clearly used to suggest the aridity of the spiritual world in which the characters live, and Maria's meaningless journeys are a symbol of her inability to escape this world. It is noteworthy that although the book is set in the late sixties or early seventies, a time of great ferment and social change in America, news of the outside world plays virtually no part in the book; Miss Didion's characters seem able to shut it out completely.<br />The bleakness of the world inhabited by Maria and her acquaintances means that this is certainly not a feelgood novel. It is, in many ways, not an easy one to like. It is, however, certainly one worth reading.	2003-02-02

(The title refers to the lawn in front of the house, which later becomes a symbol of their carefree pre-war youth). The novel then follows the changing fortunes of these five, of their Uncle Richard and Aunt Helena, of Max and Monika, an Austrian Jewish refugee couple, of the local Rector and his wife and of their twin sons, through the war. Intercut with the wartime scenes are scenes set in the 1980s, at Max's funeral, when his surviving friends and acquaintances meet to reveal what has happened to them during the intervening years. <br />The above synopsis might suggest that this is a lengthy novel; in fact, it is quite a short one (in my edition only 330 pages), and in my view it is the shortness of the novel which is its major problem. Miss Wesley has set herself the task of telling the stories of a large group of people, but has not allowed herself adequate space in which to perform that task. As a result, the complex story is told in insufficient detail, which means that the characters fail to come alive. <br />The major theme of the novel is the challenge posed to conventional ideas of morality by the changed conditions of wartime. (Most of the characters either form adulterous liaisons or indulge in casual promiscuity). This theme could have been an interesting one, but unfortunately the characters are under-developed and lack any sense of an inner life. It is therefore difficult to understand their motivation or the reasons for their behaviour, and the oportunity to develop this major theme is lost. Most of the main characters, in fact, simply come across as self-centred and lacking in feeling. Even those described as being in love are frequently unfaithful to each other. This would not matter if Miss Wesley's aim had been to create a portrait of a cold, selfish group of people, but I was left with the strong impression that she wanted to make many of them sympathetic or attractively unconventional and failed to do so. This is not a book I could recommend. <br />I noticed a few factual errors in the book. I will not go through them all, but I must say that, contrary to what Miss Wesley states, the conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler was not \\"very pro-Hitler\\".	2003-01-24

Among the more popular ones are \\"What if there had been no Reformation?\\", \\"What if the South had won the American Civil War?\\" and,of course, \\"What if Hitler had never been born?\\" and \\"What if the Nazis had won World War Two?\\"<br />Stephen Fry exercises considerable ingenuity in combining these last two questions with the science-fiction theme \\"Could we travel back in time and alter the past?\\" The central premise of his novel is that two Cambridge academics, Michael Young, a young historian, and Leo Zuckerman, an elderly German-born physicist, decide to prevent the birth of Adolf Hitler by using a time-machine to introduce contraceptives into the water-supply of his home town of Braunau shortly before his conception. <br />Unfortunately, this experiment goes awry. Then second half of the novel is set in a world where the Nazis still came to power in the early 1930s led by one Rudolf Gloder, a man as ruthless as Hitler but more subtle and cunning. Under Gloder's leadership, Germany develops the atomic bomb and uses it to dominate Europe. America remains independent and nominally democratic, but develops into a deeply reactionary society, racist, anti-homosexual and with an intrusive secret police. <br />This is a clever idea, and Stephen Fry writes with a good deal of wit and style. There are a couple more, very dark, twists of the plot, which I will not reveal. Nevertheless, the book suffers from structural weaknesses. The main one is the decision to set the second part of the book in America rather than Nazi-ruled Europe. (In the alternative universe he has conjured up, Michael is a student at Princeton rather than Cambridge). This means that we never see the effects of the tyranny of Gloder and his successors for ourselves, but merely hear about it at second hand. Nor is it explained why an America engaged in a cold war with Nazi Germany should have become so much more reactionary and backward-looking than an America engaged in a cold war with Soviet Russia. The concentration on the failings of American society in the alternative universe makes the book seem rather unbalanced; indeed, when Michael and his Princeton friend Stephen Burns come up with a scheme to undo the damage by ensuring that Hitler is born after all, one is left with the impression that they are motivated less by the desire to liberate Europe from Nazi rule than by the wish to make America safe for long hair, gay pride marches and Ecstasy.<br />The second structural weakness is that, although most of the book is written in the form of a first-person prose narrative, lengthy (and key) sections are written in the form of a film screenplay. The two styles of writing do not mesh together well, because the screenplay mode of writing does not serve to convey characters' feelings and motivations as well as does prose narrative. In a film, of course, the bare bones of the screenplay are fleshed out by the contributions of the actors and director, who have other techniques of conveying emotion, but when the screenplay stands by itself it makes for very flat reading. This adversely affects the book in one very important way. During the first half of the book, Michael is heterosexual with a girlfriend. During the second half, he becomes a homosexual and he and Stephen fall in love. Unfortunately, the scene where they realise their love for each other is one of those written in the screenplay form, so the reader is left with no idea what has prompted this sudden reversal of the sexual orientation of the central character, and Michael's sudden conversion to homosexuality seems completely implausible.  <br />Another point that interested me was the tension between Stephen Fry's obvious political liberalism and the deeper conservative theme of his book. The Law of Unintended Consequences - the law that says that in seeking to make a thing better we often make it worse and that the more radical the change we seek, the more likely it is that it will lead to disaster - is, after all, a basic element of conservative political thought, but one that is generally rejected by liberals and radicals as too pessimistic. I wonder if Mr Fry was aware of this contrast- something I would have like to have seen explored more deeply <br />As another reader has pointed out, Hitler's home town is named Braunau, not Brunau, the spelling that appears in the book throughout. Mr Fry, however, seems to have researched the historical background thoroughly, so I presume that this error is the fault of an editor or proof-reader rather of his own. <br />The idea behind this book is an interesting one; I would, however, like to have seen it better handled. Hence the title of this review- my grandfather's favourite expression for something done clumsily that could have been done better. <br />To declare an interest, Stephen Fry and I were at Cambridge together, and I knew him slightly. I doubt if he remembers me (if he is reading this, he is probably thinking \\"James who?\\"), but I certainly remember him. I hope this has not coloured my review.	2002-12-25

Although the first part of the book dealing with the love affair is well done, the main strength of the novel lies in the vividness of its descriptions of the life of the trenches. Mr Faulks does not shy away from describing the privations and suffering of the soldiers who fought in that most terrible of wars, and the result is a sombre but inspiring work which increases the reader's respect for the bravery of those men.     The book also has its weaknesses, which is why I have only awarded it four stars. Like others who have reviewed it here, I found the modern scenes dull and unconvincing, leaving a sense of anti-climax after the powerful battle-scenes. The character of Stephen himself is perhaps too cold and detached fully to engage the reader's emotions (although there are other characters who do, notably the sapper Jack Firebrace,whose death near the end is perhaps the most poignant scene in the book). The wartime affair between Isabelle and the German soldier Max (something that at the time would have been regarded by most French people as a betrayal of her country)is a potentially interesting theme but is treated all too briefly.    It would, however, be wrong to end this review on anything other than a positive note. This novel fully deserves the praise it has won as a powerful treatment of both the brutality and the heroism of warfare.	2002-11-28
US	36348634	RPE83LWNK2OJF	0393315711	522619283	The Beatles	Books	5	9	10	N	Y	An Excellent Introduction to the Beatles	I was too young to remember much of the Beatles in their heyday, and although I was familiar with a lot of their songs, I did not know a lot about them as individuals. Two things happened towards the end of last year to arouse my interest. The first was the death of George Harrison, with all the media interest it generated. The second was when I asked my niece Imogen (then aged seven) what she wanted for Christmas. \\"A Beatles CD\\" came the reply. And this from a little girl whose parents are too young to remember much of the sixties. So much for those who say that the Beatles are only relevant to ageing ex-hippies, not to modern youngsters.  <br />I decided to look for a book which gave the full story of the group. this was surprisingly difficult to find in the shops, but I eventually came across Hunter Davies's book on Amazon. This was just what I was looking for. Most biographies of popstars and showbiz celebrities are very lightweight affairs, but Davies's book is solid and workmanlike and full of useful information, despite having first been published in 1968 at the height of the Beatles boom.<br />The sections about the Beatles' early years are excellent. My only criticism is that their later years are not covered in such detail, although there are possibly reasons for this. When the book was first published, Davies may well have thought that the events of 1966-68 (when the Beatles did much of their best work) were too well-known to be retold in great detail. The book also includes a postscript dating from 1985; I would have liked this to have been more detailed, but perhaps the author, who knew the Beatles personally, felt that it was not appropriate to go into detail about the events surrounding the group's break-up in 1969-70. He may also have felt that the details of their post-1970 careers were beyond the scope of his book. <br />All in all, I felt that this was an excellent book which I could recommend to anyone looking like me for an introduction to the Beatles' lives and work.	2002-09-07
