This reference book is easy to use and understand. When I first leaned of this home edition version of the Merck manual I was hesitant. Over the years many books have been published that are medical in nature, some published by doctors, but the content is watered down or so vague that a layperson doesn't derive much information from it. Some books are actually condescending in attitude, some patronizing. So many books briefly skim symptoms and then caution to call a physician for more information.<br /><br />My son was diagnosed on the phone by our pediatrician with chicken pox and it was made clear that they did not want to see him for a physical exam. I was given a tiny bit of information by the office staff but was still curious for more information. I spent over an hour surfing the Internet looking for information but found watered down information, repeated many times over on multiple websites, including some written by physicians intended for laypeople to use. I looked at my parenting books written by doctors (one titled \\"The Portable Pediatrician\\") and was still lacking any substantial information.<br /><br />But when I consulted the Merck Manual home edition, (which I had forgotten I bought recently and had not yet used), I was surprised at the level of information given. There are many details that I had not found elsewhere, such as number of days from exposure to outbreak, how long it takes the pox to change from first appearance to crusted over, about how long the infection lasts, and treatment suggestions. Reasons why some children have a mild outbreak vs. a severe outbreak were even provided, something I had not found anywhere else.<br /><br />The information here is not dumbed down in that it is not so vague that it is not useful. There is a lot of information here but it is written in a style for the layperson to understand. I appreciated the writing style, which presents information to the non-physician without putting on airs.<br /><br />Anyone who, like me, prefers to gather information and learn about things rather than making a call or office visit to their doctor to get just one opinion will appreciate owning this book. At about 1500 pages it covers many illnesses and ailments. If you are interested in this book I suggest you buy it so that you have it at your fingertips 24 hours a day, for whatever may arise. I am not suggesting this take the place of a doctor, but I know from working with physicians that there are certain calls that are non-emergent in nature that are not appreciated when the office is closed!<br /><br />Note: I write this review in 6/2002 and don't know why the review never appeared here.

I received this as a gift in 1994, the year it was first published. Although I have a large cookbook collection now, I use less than ten on a regular basis. Classic Home Desserts is a great cookbook and is my staple for baking desserts, especially for cake recipes.<br /><br />I feel that healthy eating is best, but desserts do have a special place-mostly reserved for holidays and special occasions in our household.  My policy is that if I am going to eat a dessert, I want it to be worth the calories, fat and carbs. There is nothing worse than eating a dessert that is flavorless or just inferior quality-but you won't have that problem with baking from THIS cookbook.<br /><br />After getting married and then, later, after having children, I began a tradition to bake a birthday cake for my family members from scratch and this cookbook is my recipe source. Each time I serve a dessert from this book I receive numerous compliments. Several people have also suggested that I open a bakery or start a home business baking desserts. This always surprises me as all I did was follow the directions in the recipes in this book-nothing special was done on my part and certainly the recipes are not my original creations. For the cakes, I am always surprised when people are shocked when they find that the cake actually has flavor-because they have grown used to grocery store baked cakes which have almost no flavor!<br /><br />Our family favorite for yellow cake is the 1-2-3-4 cake, it is very moist and flavorful and always receives rave reviews. I also use the 1-2-3-4 cake recipe, as per the books directions, as the cake portion of the Boston Cr&egrave;me Pie. The Applesauce-Carrot Cake is the absolute best carrot cake I've ever had in my life, and friends and relatives agree. (I amend the recipe by omitting the lemon from the frosting and use vanilla extract instead for a traditional cream cheese frosting that is not lemon flavored). The Chocolate Cloud Cake is to die for, and a must-try for chocoholics (use the best chocolate you can find for the best flavor). The All-American Fudge-Chunk Brownies are delicious and a far cry from supermarket boxed mixes.<br /><br />I was raised in a home where cakes were baked from boxed mixes from the grocery store. I now know that cakes from scratch with quality ingredients are far superior in taste. Baking cakes from scratch is also not difficult at all and takes just a few minutes more than using a boxed mix (the extra time is the 3-4 minutes it takes to cream the butter and sugar).<br /><br />A Kitchen Aid stand-up mixer is also a kitchen must-have and makes baking so easy!<br /><br />Cookbooks that have different recipes than Classic Home Desserts which are also staples for baking in my kitchen are: The King Arthur Flour 200th Anniversary Cookbook for the bread recipes (easy to make with the stand-up mixer) and for Italian cookies and Christmas cookies: Sweet Maria's Italian Cookie Tray: A Cookbook by Maria Bruscino Sanche.<br /><br />This book would make a wonderful gift!t-try for chocoholics (use the best chocolate you can find for the best flavor).

In any event this book or at least the good items in it should be taught to all children by their parents, and reinforced at school.<br /><br />Please take note and consider this when reading other Amazon customer reviews:<br /><br />McKnight-Trontz explains in the introduction that both the information and images in this book were culled from civic textbooks, scouting manuals, government pamphlets and citizenship manuals from the 1920s through the 1960s. See my comments on the illustrations near the end of my review.<br /><br />There is a lot of good information here and many different viewpoints on what the definition of a good citizen is, and how children and adults can do things that constitute being a good citizen. Some of the information seemed a bit comical to me yet other parts were things that (sadly) I had never discussed with my children before just because it had not occurred to me to discuss them, therefore the book served as a basis for some good discussion. I am happy that I read this to my children and think it could and should be re-read periodically, perhaps a few times per year! I also thought, as I read this, that I was never taught many things in this book when I attended public school in the 1970s and 1980s, as part of social studies/civics (which is a shame). I also think that much of this SHOULD be taught to all children in school. If they can teach sex ed and programs to discourage drug use, then they can and should teach this stuff as well. I also was surprised at the high level of patriotism here. I was surprised that in my public school experience, I did not learn any of this \\"patriotic attitude\\" and was surprised that from the 1920s-1960s this stuff was being taught in schools. I think we need a revival of this!<br /><br />The book is divided into chapters covering different areas we can and should be good citizens in: with ourselves, in the family, at school and work, in the neighborhood, in the community, in our country and in the world. The section about ourselves includes personality traits, behaviors, character traits and values as well as health recommendations such as avoiding infection, how to cough and not spread germs, how to stand with good posture and what to eat. The comical parts are the examples which highlight things that someone thought to be very important such as that a good citizen eats \\"plenty of meat\\" which made me wonder if this was from a government publication connected with the USDA. Behaviors such as not talking back, controlling oneself and obeying the law are other high points. A section titled \\"Your Happy Family\\" contains good advice:<br /><br />\\"The urge to get more and more luxuries consumes many Americans. In the \\"old days\\" the members of the family had very little in the way of luxuries or even comforts; they depended mainly on one another to make life happy and interesting. Today, we are more \\"gadget-minded.\\" We tend to think less of human relations, and more of things that we and buy and use, often to impress other people. This has had its effect in weakening the home.<br /><br />Think less of what the \\"Joneses\\" are doing or buying, and more about how to have a good time with your family without spending money. Think about what really makes you and your family happy-important things such as each other's company, a good story, exercise, and learning.\\"<br /><br />I loved that section!<br /><br />The section on school and work includes what we now call \\"anti-bullying\\" advice: play fair, play with \\"the laws of clean play\\" which includes not cheating. I grinned at some of the phrasing such as \\"Clean play increases and train's one's strength, and helps one to be more useful to one's country\\" and goes on to make a few recommendations about being a good loser or a generous winner and to treat opponents with politeness.It seems to me all children should hear all the information in this book.<br /><br />Regarding social ills, the section on community includes a page encouraging the avoidance of being a drunkard and warns \\"alcoholism means death to the nation\\". I am not faulting the book but will mention that missing from the book due to the fact that such things were not discussed in the 1920s to 1960s are warnings against cigarette smoking, illegal drug use, other unhealthy acts such as sniffing glue, and sex issues and warnings of sexually transmitted diseases.<br /><br />The section on our country contains information about voting, jury duty, how to write our legislators and politicians to voice our concerns, and recommending that we be happy to pay our taxes. The patriotism level here is high!<br /><br />In response to the negative reviews which some claimed was due to non-inclusion of non-white people in the illustrations: I want to state here that this is false. Images of black Americans are rare but not totally (see pages 54, 100 and 103). People of other cultures are discussed on the \\"good citizenship in the world\\" section and show Asian people on pages 130, 131, and 136. However we should all note as described in the introduction, that this author was really an editor and the text and illustrations were taken from other sources dating back to the 1920s through the 1960s. The fact that the textbooks and government documents used primarily Caucasians in the illustrations should come as no surprise to anyone who is familiar with American history. Take this for what it is worth. This book was published in 2001 using old information. There is no reason to slight the author or the book for not writing in modern terms or addressing modern issues or showing people of all ethnicities.ss.

This book is intended for parents of homeschooled children of all ages and grades.<br /><br />There are essays written by 50 different experienced Christian homeschoolers who write what their mistakes were and how they fixed them. They want you to avoid making the same mistakes. All of them seem very happy now, some were facing homeschooling burn out at some point in the past. Some of the essay-writers are well known in the Christian homeschooling community such as curriculum-authors, Christian homeschooling book authors, homeschooling magazine column writers or homeschooling conference speakers.<br /><br />It is not mentioned on the front or back cover but this is very religious content to the point where it may not be helpful to every reader (such as saying if you don't like your curriculum to pray about it).<br /><br />Many of the homeschoolers wrote that at first they were very rigid and doing \\"school at home\\", some even requiring the Pledge of Allegiance, having a flag and desks, and taking attendance. These parents learned over time that learning can be fun (which was a revelation to them) and many ditched the rigid schedules for a looser or very loose learning environment. Some people remain shocked that learning can be fun and are trying to get this point across to the reader. If you already are in that groove you will not learn much.<br /><br />I found many of the essays to be repetitive of each other, with the same issues and the same resolutions. I have the suspicion that all were included as they are respected and often well-known people in the Christian homeschooling world. Some of the writers are now curriculum authors, are homeschooling conference speakers, are Christian homeschooling book authors, or are authors of regular columns in Christian homeschooling magazines.<br /><br />Despite the title implying that the book is written to new homeschoolers so they avoid burnout, I felt the book also speaks to a parent who is already using a highly structured form of homeschooling and is burning out. With all the homeschooling books, magazines and free online chat lists I would think that all parents considering homeschooling would be aware that a more loose method is an option that is being used by many happy homeschooling parents and that those children are actually learning! But if someone is not aware of this, then this may be the book to introduce that concept and underscore that a more loose method works for both a harmonious home and results in smart children. If you want a book of advice that is full of Christian references then this is the book for you (there are others on the market without a speck of religious reference that may not appeal to you if you want religious references).<br /><br />I read this book after we had already begun homeschooling. I also had done research about homeschooling before we \\"officially began\\" and for whatever reason was under the impression that more homeschoolers had a \\"loose\\" style than a \\"rigid\\" style. I already knew learning could be made fun. This book did not reveal much new information to me. I also was a bit bored by the amount of repetition, for example, multiple essays driving home the same point. I don't know if that was done so that the major point was repeated over and over so the reader would believe it or if the editors wanted an essay from those specific writers, or 50 essays, or what. I am sure many Christian homeschoolers will enjoy this book.e implying that the book is written to new homeschoolers so they avoid burnout, I felt the book also speaks to a parent who is already using a highly structured form of homeschooling and is burning out.

The story begins with a daydreaming Giotto, a sheep-shepherd boy, who draws on anything he can find such as rocks and in dirt, and with anything he can find, such as chalk or charcoal. His talents go unnoticed by his family and he is scolded for neglecting his shepherding duties, which at one point in the story, resulted in losing a lost sheep. He meets the painter, Cimabue, and learns that there is such a thing as paint and the people paint on wood panels just for the sake of making art. Cimabue asks Giotto's parents to let him become his apprentice and they refuse. Giotto is kept shepherding sheep at home for seven more years, and then his parents let him receive art instruction from Cimabue. Cimabue teaches Giotto how to paint a fresco (not an easy task) and as the book closes, we see Giotto going on to start a new assignment: painting the fresco at a church dedicated to Saint Francis. The story ends there, nothing more is said of how his life turned out and of the many wonderful works of art he produced, or that this sheep shepherd born in poverty ended up a wealthy man.<br /><br />Some parents may not like that the parents come across in a negative way when they refuse to let their eight year old boy leave them to go into apprenticeship with Cimabue. The father states he wants him to stay home to work as a shepherd (with no positive messages about the value of a child helping their family make a living). The mother says she feels he is too young, and for some reason, it comes across in an overly protective way. I got the impression that the parents were being stupid not to let their very talented son leave for an apprenticeship at age eight. Nothing is said to indicate that the next seven years that he remained with his family to work and mature was a good thing. In other words this is not portrayed as a positive work ethic/helping the family type of situation. Another moral issue that a parent may take with this story is that Giotto meets Cimabue when he sneaks out of his house after being grounded as punishment for losing a sheep; Giotto's entire future was changed for the better as the result of not respecting his father's authority. I mention these, as I know some parents will take issue with these moral issues.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story, especially for the message that young children can have natural talents that can be valued by people, and that if natural talent is combined with further training, wonderful works of art, and fame, may be achieved.  The illustrations are just beautiful. I was disappointed that the beginning of the story didn't even state the time period or location. Since this is a true story why not have the opening sentence contain the place and time that this happened? Children who don't know anything (yet) about Giotto will have no clue as to the time period that this is taking place in, or where. Perhaps it would be best if the child receive some background information about Giotto before they read or hear this book read aloud.  Since the book does not contain any reproductions of Giotto's work, I suggest following up by showing the child(ren) some of his actual work (some can be viewed on the internet for free). Usually nonfiction books like this are followed by an afterward or some author's notes containing more detailed factual information that the parent or teacher can read and then discuss with the child(ren). Unfortunately this book does not provide that. For these reasons I give the book 4 stars instead of 5.amily type of situation.

The writing style is not dumbed down or patronizing in tone. This is book is one in a series, others are about other musical composers and artists.<br />The first few pages explain what the musical climate was like in Mozart's life and explains how people used music for entertainment purposes. This is brief and a very good opening to put Mozart's life in perspective. The rest of the book is a full span of Mozart's life. Unlike other books for children about Mozart, the fact that Mozart was a boy genius is not the main content of the book. Oddly, Mozart's children are never mentioned. Mozart's marriage is briefly mentioned as is Mozart's death.<br />I have mixed feelings about the illustrations. I appreciated that the illustrations documented the various time periods of Mozart's life. I loved the illustrations that were photographs, fine drawings, or copies of fine paintings of the places Mozart visited, of Mozart and his family, and scenes of his operas. I did not at all like the eight cartoons whose illustrations and accompanying text were sarcastic and silly. These eight cartoons were completely out of character with the text of the book and I didn't appreciate them at all. My children and I have enjoyed other books by this author that did not have dumb cartoons and jokes. My children, aged 4 and 6 haven't needed these silly and sometimes insulting jokes to make the subject matter enjoyable. The interesting biography's text and other illustrations are high quality and are better off without these cartoons. The cartoons downgrade my rating to a 4.<br />I recommend this book and others by Mike Venezia to teach young children about important people in history.	2004-06-28

With each going to 100, it is a great way to learn or reinforce counting up to 100 skills. The pages have only black print on them, so the resulting image may be colored in. The images are cartoon-like silly pictures such as a smiling monkey, a rabbit licking a big lollipop, and goofy animals wearing clothing and making silly faces. There are a few that try to be scary, a mean-faced cobra, a frowning monster and a mean looking sheriff-bulldog.<br />These are perfect for young children who are learning to count to 100. Older children may find the puzzles too easy or the images too juvenile.<br />I also recommend for older children, the educational dot-to-dot books by Monica Russo and others by Evan and Lyle Kimble. Fun books for older kids to adult level are the \\"Greatest Dot to Dot book in the world\\" of which there are 4 different books in the series.	2004-05-04

Each puzzle goes from A to Z (which is wonderful and better than other books such as published by School Zone which have less number of dots and don't always go all the way to Z), so this also helps with learning the letter names and their sequence, always from A through to Z.<br />The paper is good quality white paper stock. The images are in black and white, so when the puzzle is complete, the child may color it in. The images are goofy and silly looking animals, some of which are wearing clothing.<br />Wonderful for preschool aged children! Dot to Dot books make great gifts for young children, especially children who seem to have enough toys!<br />This author also has a book in which all puzzles go from 1-100, which I recommend. If you are looking for dot-to-dots for older children, see the series \\"Greatest Dot to Dot Book in the World!\\". For books with text with educational content, one book per topic, see books by Monica Russo and by Evan and Lyle Kimble.	2004-05-04

The dots are arranged in a way that when you begin working on it, you can't guess what it will turn out to be. The highest number in the book is 250, so this is appropriate for any aged person that can count to 250, although most of the puzzles are under 160.  Unlike most dot to dot books, the page/puzzle size is 9.5 x 11 inches. The spaces between dots is sometimes very small which lends to a detailed image. Keep in mind, though, that young children may lack the fine motor skills to draw very straight short lines in order to make the best looking image. Adults who like dot-to-dot puzzles will find these fun. The paper is high quality and white, (not cheap newsprint paper). I am not sure of the papers' pound weight but it is heavier than 20 lb. copy paper.	2004-05-04

Puzzles are large sized, 8.5\\"x11\\" and the facing page has the name of the constellation, the legend in a one paragraph summary, the number of stars, star facts. Some of the pages have \\"did you know\\" facts added to them. The paper is much nicer than most consumable workbooks, and is heavier than 20# copy paper. Books by this author are much higher quality than the typical drug store dot-to-dot workbooks.<br />The youngest age for this book would be whatever age your child is willing or able to learn to count up to about 165. Using dot-to-dot books to reinforce counting skills to higher numbers is a great way to \\"sneak in\\" math. Ignore the publisher's age range of 9-12 if your child is younger and can count to 165. My 6 year-old son is going through a phase of loving dot-to-dot puzzles that go to a high number and he will sit and do an entire book (if allowed) and will beg for more! Some of the connections are of a short length and therefore are helpful when developing fine motor skills, for the younger children. Of course this makes a great addition to any unit study of space, the constellations, or Ancient Greece, as it contains a good amount of educational content that is well written.<br />I highly recommend all of the dot-to-dot books by Evan and Lael Kimble and also those by Monica Russo.	2004-04-13
US	51212167	R1NEHFF356ODY4	061823151X	581502777	On Sand Island (Golden Kite Honors)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	About a 10 year old boy's hard work and independence	This is based on a true story, a 10-year-old boy whose mother is deceased, living on Sand Island (in Lake Superior), a community of Norwegian's, with his father and with his younger sister. His father is a fisherman and he longs for the day when he can have his own boat. His younger sister tells him he is too young to own his own boat. He decided to make his dream a reality and one step at a time, and does build his own boat. He does not have a full plan at the beginning but takes it one step at a time. He finds male neighbors and friends to help him along the way, by borrowing a tool or bartering his work for their time and labor. I found it odd that he never asked his father for help, a little odd that there was more help from neighbors than his own father, but I assume his father was very busy fishing to support his family! The last step in the process was getting oars and his father did give him some old oars that they had in storage, which Carl had to refinish.<br />The themes in the book are of independence, hard work, perseverance, and ingenuity. I thought the boys resourcefulness in finding help wonderful. The boy's positive attitude is wonderful. With each step of the boat-building project we see the amount of hard work that he had to put into making it, a wonderful thing to see in a 10 year old.<br />The book ends first with Carl's peaceful and rewarding solo boat ride then with a party to celebrate the newest boat on the island including music and dancing.<br />The illustrations are gorgeous, pale paintings that look as if painted atop a canvas laid with sand!<br />In the author's note at the back of the book, I learned that this tale is set in the early 1900s and is based on a real person named Carl Dahl. In the 1940s sea lampreys came into Lake Superior and killed all the whitefish and trout, essentially killing the fishing industry there. The site of Carl Dahl's home is now being used to house a ranger's cabin for the National Park Service.	2004-03-16

Text is very short with rhymes for reading to younger readers, and each topic also has 2-3 paragraphs of longer, more detailed and educational information. The subjects are the state bird, state flower, state tree, famous places, and famous people from Connecticut. A sampling of the topics are P.T. Barnum, Groton where the first nuclear submarine was built, composer Charles Ives, the first law school: the Litchfield Law School, Amelia Simmons, author of the first American cookbook, Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe. I was a little surprised that Y was not for Yale, but instead, \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\" with an unknown author and not a unique to Connecticut link was selected.<br />The illustrations are in watercolor and are beautiful!<br />This is one in a series of books on individual states in America. Note there are different authors and illustrators. I feel the illustrations in this book are superior to some of the other books (although perhaps this is tainted by my love of watercolors).<br />This book is appropriate for every child who lives in Connecticut and for any child who is learning about Connecticut. I believe every child should know about the state they live in. This book is nice to look at and the content is not too long, so it will appeal to many children. I am impressed by the quality of the content of the books and plan to use each of the books in the series when teaching my children about each of the States.<br />This would make a great gift for a child, and a copy should reside in every public library and in every school library. I also feel that public libraries should have the entire series in their collection!	2004-03-16

The writing is eloquent and is a fresh change from the usual content of most history books. Using first-person narrative, the worker tells what their job is like. Some examples of the vocations covered are launderer, scribe, farmer, pyramid-builder, embalmer, and dancer.<br />There are two pages of background information about the 13 vocations, and a list of source materials at the back that is helpful for locating more resources to use when learning about life in Ancient Egypt.<br />I can't say enough about the beautiful illustrations by Barry Moser. The cover's illustration is exactly the type of high-quality work that lies inside the book. The background paper for the entire book looks similar to papyrus. A wonderful book! I hope that National Geographic makes this one in a series and that future book have equally high quality writing and illustrations.	2004-03-14

This is a picture book format biography of Eratosthenes, who lived in Ancient Greece, focusing on how he calculated the size of the Earth using a mathematical formula and measurements taken by measuring shadows and length of footsteps from one location to another. Eratostehenes had many roles and talents, one being that he was a mathematician and author of books on several topics. He wrote the first geography book, which included the first map of the world and the first documentation of the size of the Earth.<br />The publisher says this is for ages 4-8 however the math concept of the formula he used to determine the size of the Earth was too complex for my 6 year old to grasp. The text is long-ish compared to a typical picture book as well, so I think this can extend a little beyond 8 yrs. if it is acting as a brief biography. I am not sure how many chapter book format biographies are out there for kids 9 and up on Eratosthenes, so this may be better than nothing for older kids!<br />The colorful pictures are nice and really compliment the text, especially when showing how he thought about measuring the Earth and comparing it to a grapefruit. It also addresses the idea of asking questions, curiosity, and making guesses at answers about things in the world that they did not yet know about.<br />This is a combination of history, math, and geography with a little scientific thought thrown in. It laid out his first questions and theories and how he came up with different ideas to come up with a way to measure a part of the land. We learn about what worked and what failed, leading up to how he finally came to a method that he thought was accurate, and why he thought this formula would work. His computation was about 200 miles off of the distance we measured in this century!<br />Within the story we learn about what schools were like for boys in Ancient Greece, that books were in scroll format, what libraries were like (and that they were rare) and other tidbits.<br />There is a bibliography included that can be used for further reading resources as well. This book is also a great example of how one book can cross over several subject areas: math, history, science and geography./>There is a bibliography included that can be used for further reading resources as well.

It also contains two photos from Boston's Museum of Science's electricity show, which are interesting, and a special treat for those of us who have seen that wonderful show.<br />The content of the book is great and gives more detail about lightning than I've found in other children's books on this subject. An example is giving a list of all the different types of lightning and even revealing three new kinds of lightning discovered in 1995. Who knew? Three other books I read about lightning and storms failed to give the level of detail that Simon chose to include.<br />Simon tells us what to do if we are caught in a lightning storm but it is done in a careful way with statistics given such as the number of people hit by lightning who lived through is almost double the number who are hit and die as a result of it.<br />As usual Simon writes in a non-patronizing tone, which I appreciate. We really enjoyed this book. A must-read for learning about the weather!	2004-03-09

There is plenty of information about what we know about how the storm is created, the role of electricity in the storm, etc. What people should do if they are caught in a storm so that the risk of personal injury is lessened is also explained in detail. Hail is explained with a wonderful photo of a cross-section of a large hailstone. The damage and injury that hail can do is explained in detail. There are brief descriptions of two types of clouds. Simple rainstorms are not discussed, and not every type of cloud is addressed.<br />I felt that the author should have included an explanation of how certain storms are regional or more likely to occur in certain areas of North America. Warnings of death, airplane flight issues, and injury are given, so be forewarned if you are reading this to very young readers. There is no mention as to the frequency of the storms, which had my child worried that we'd soon encounter a tornado (even though they are extremely rare in our area of the country and despite the fact that I censored out some of the scarier results of the storms).<br />NOTE: After I read \\"Storms\\" and wrote the above review I read his separate books focused on one topic: \\"Hurricanes\\" and \\"Lightning\\". The books which focus on one topic are actually more interesting in style of writing, contain more information about where storms hit, details of how dangerous they are or are not, and give many more specific and wonderful photographs. Therefore I prefer the books that focus on one individual topic. \\"Storms\\" seems to boil down the information in a way that is not equal to reading the individual books. For this reason I will rate this book a 4, and I rate the individual books a 5.<br />The photographs are stunning and depict everything covered: from gorgeous lightening to large storm fronts, to hurricanes with the eye visible, to a series of photos of a tornado, going from its' beginning to end. I feel the high quality photographs are key to maintaining the interest level of the child and they help the child understand and remember the information.from its' beginning to end.

When my 6 year-old son saw the cover he begged for me to read it immediately. He loved the book and is asking if there are others available (which there are because this is one in a series).<br />We had just finished \\"Growing up in Ancient Greece\\" by Chris Chelipi which I thought was a bit boring. \\"Adventures in Ancient Greece\\" duplicated the same information and included additional information. So if you are wondering if this comic book style book (less serious tone) is lacking in content, I can assure you that it is not.<br />The format of the book is comic book style with sidebars that read more like a regular text. The storyline is that a boy and his two sisters enter a time travel-travel agency and request to go to the next Olympic games in the future. By mistake they are transported to Ancient Greece. A boy gives them a tour of Athens and explains daily life in Ancient Greece. They experience daily living such as the role of women, slaves, and foreign visitors vs. men, voting, worship, parties, and common foods eaten. They also find themselves in the middle of a war that is called to a truce before casualties occur, at the Olympics, and finally on a warship that is engaged in a war before coming back home, magically. There is some sarcasm and some silliness. Some of the sarcasm borders on disrespect, such as when the boy gives them olives to eat, and proclaims they are the best in the world and the boy thinks, \\"this is a treat?\\" The girl is annoyed that women lead subservient lives and makes some sarcastic comments. I chose to skip over some of the silly and sarcastic comments. In the end I know my son learned important content from this book, which is the goal!	2004-02-25

There are plenty of facts about Venus.<br />I am impressed by the entire series of picture books by Seymour Simon and our family has been enjoying his books, one about each planet, which we are using as part of our homeschooling.  I have found that many of the books that attempt to cover all topics about space end up skimping on important general information that Simon easily communicates, such as the temperature and how it compares to Earth, why humans could not survive on the planet, and the general weather conditions and how they compare to weather on Earth. The way these comparisons are made really helps children understand the conditions on the planets. This series by Simon is also superior to other books about Venus and space because the photos are in color; they are real, stunning photos, not lame illustrations drawn by hand. This book also features images made with data captured by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter spacecraft in 1980, from bouncing radio waves off of the surface of Venus. Photographs taken by the Soviet spacecraft, Venera 13, when it landed on the surface in 1982, shortly before the weather conditions and atmospheric pressure completely destroyed it. Images and information learned from NASA's Magellan in the 1990s is also included in this book.<br />As with all the books in this series, the content begins with what we can see with our naked eye from Earth (Venus looks like a brightest star in the night sky).<br />I highly recommend that any parent read these books to their children.

Bright and lovely illustrations by Jos. A. Smith and reproductions of van Gogh and Gaugin's works comprise the illustrations. There is not much coverage of the impressionists in general. If this is read as a first exposure to van Gogh, Gaugin, or impressionism, the child will be confused or not understanding. I feel this is a great accompaniment after the child knows something about the Impressionist movement, van Gogh, and Gaugin. The bright and lively illustrations really make this a special book.<br />The story covers the time when van Gogh invited Gaugin to visit through their visit and then ending with a description of their pen pal relationship after Gaugin left Arles. The story explains the different painting methods they used, even when painting the same subject at the same time. The author explains their use of their favorite colors for backgrounds is shown and how van Gogh preferred to paint exactly what he saw while Gaugin preferred to paint from his imagination or from the content of his dreams.<br />Their explosive relationship is discussed, including a fight that culminated in van Gogh cutting off part of his ear, which was the last straw for Gaugin, resulting in Gaugin's departure. Depending on the sensitivity of the child, learning of this event this could be disturbing. At the back of the book is a one-page biography of each artist. I am not sure if this part was intended to be read to the child; within the van Gogh bio, it is explained that van Gogh suffered from strange moods since boyhood, then goes on to say that after the ear-cutting episode the townspeople \\"demanded he be locked up in a mental hospital\\" and goes on to say he did end up in a mental asylum. Whether you want to read this to your young child is up to you. I take issue with the idea of telling young children that townspeople can call for someone to be locked up and then knowing it came to fruition! There is also the question of how much information you want your young child to know, or how much can they understand, about depression, mental illness and the mental asylums of the 1800s. I am not calling for censorship or shaming of depression or mental illnesses, but I have issues with as to the appropriate age to venture into a discussion of mental illness, depression and self-mutilation. Other van Gogh biographies for children aged 4-8 have not included information about the ear-cutting or about the mental asylum visit, although adults seem to always be interested in this part of van Gogh's life.<br />If the book did not contain the ear-cutting incident in the main body of the story I'd rate this 5 stars; I'll rate it 4 stars due to the content potentially being disturbing for children aged 4-8 which the publisher states this is appropriate for.omeone to be locked up and then knowing it came to fruition!

I appreciate the large, color reproductions. There is very brief biographical information at the beginning of the book. I don't feel the biographical information was quite enough, even for my 6 year old, so we will supplement with another children's biography on Gaugin. This was a great first book to read about Paul Gaugin. However, this book is not to be missed.

This is a wonderful tale of a 4-year-old boy's close relationship with his 94-year-old great-grandmother. His great-grandmother lives in the upstairs bedroom of the house with his grandmother and grandfather, who play a lesser role in the book. The little boy has a weekly routine of visiting \\"Nana Upstairs\\" and sharing mints with her. It is nice to see an elderly person being cared for in the home of relatives rather than in a nursing home! She is so frail that she can't sit upright unassisted, so she is tied into a chair. Don't worry; this is not a scary thing! The little boy also insists on being tied in, so they can be alike. Eventually Nana Upstairs dies. This is not over dramatized and my children were not upset about this, perhaps because the boy is comforted when he sees a falling star in the sky and thinks it is a sign that Nana Upstairs is sending him a kiss. Years later we see the boy as an adult and we find out that Nana Downstairs has died, and he sees another shooting star and is again comforted.<br />This is a lovely picture book representing a strong bond between a grandparents and their grandson. If you enjoy this book, you'll also like Tomie DePaola's \\"Now One Foot, Now the Other\\".<br />I learned of this book by reading an analysis of it in the book \\"Inside Picture Books\\" by Ellen H. Spitz, which is a very detailed analysis of the content of picture books focusing on themes of bedtime, separation, grandparents, death, children's behaviors/manners, and a child's self-concept and self-esteem.<br />My 3 and 6 year old sons love the book as do I! We originally borrowed it from the library but this is one we'll have to buy so I can keep up with their repeated requests for it!<br />The older version has pictures in pink, tan, and black. The new version has more colors in the illustrations. Both versions are illustrated by Tomie DePaola.	2004-02-13

I found this book to be a perfect opening to our homeschooling studies of Ancient Greece. The illustrations are colorful and high quality and the text is lively and interesting.<br />After showing a map of Greece, the book plunges into demonstrating that the Ancient Greeks invented formal education/schools and libraries, inventions such as the iron, catapult and large map of land and sea, and the first map of the stars. Other discoveries covered are architecture including inventing the first bridges, plays, the Olympics, the stadium, and the marathon. The democratic form of government and voting, and the creation of cities and states. Hippocrates' diagnostic method of medicine, the Hippocratic Oath, and the first diagram of human anatomy. The book winds up with some Greek foods and some common English words that have roots in Greek language. The book ends with a glossary of terms, a list of English words and the Greek translation, and a list of other educational resources.<br />Our family loves Kevin Davis' books!	2004-02-06

The text of this book was perfect: just enough information and written clearly and concisely. A huge draw, though, is the wonderful photographs used throughout the book. All but one image are photographs, most from NASA.  The detail of the photos is amazing and makes learning about this planet come alive.<br />I am thrilled to see that Seymour Simon has written other books on our solar system, including a book for each planet.<br />This book is the perfect combination of just the right amount of information, written well, and complimented by wonderful illustrations. A book of this caliber outshines all the other books I've seen, including those written for older age ranges, including the large volumes that attempt to cover all aspects of space. A special, visual impact is made because of the large pages full of brilliantly colored images in this picture book format. Wonderful!	2004-02-05

Best for children aged 2-5	I felt this book is most appropriate for children aged 2-5. The concepts are very basic and are not enough content for a child of age 6 and older. The topics touched upon are things such as answering if the stars are there during the daytime and is there a man in the moon? The book does a good job in some parts of trying to explain some tricky ideas to young children, such as how the earth rotates and how we have day and night. However other areas are not thorough enough, such as showing only 3 phases of the moon, new, full and crescent.<br />I read this as the first book to a space unit, with my 6 year old. It was a great overview but we needed another book to go in depth more. My 3 year old got the gist of the content of this book. I just realized there is another book in the series called \\"What's out in space\\" which may have touched upon other space topics that were missing from this book.<br />I think this is best for the very young.<br />This is one in a series by Usborne called \\"starting point science\\". Some others in the series are \\"What makes it rain?\\" and \\"Why is night dark?\\".	2004-02-05

Books	4	5	6	N	N	A nice overview in a Q&A format	Although slotted for the age range 9-12, I read it aloud to my 6 year old and he understood and enjoyed the book. The format is question and answer, which you may or may not like. We found it fine, as many address common questions. The answers are detailed with many statistics and what some would call \\"trivia\\". The tone of the writing is not patronizing and it seems to cover just enough information for an overview.<br />The subjects covered are: stars, our sun, explanation of \\"sun rising and setting\\", galaxies, the Milky Way, constellations, planets, orbits of plants, earths rotation, earths composition, Earth's atmosphere vs. space, our moon, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, meteors, and meteorites, is there life elsewhere and what are some unanswered questions we still have? This is a good overview. Note that each planet is discussed in one paragraph. I feel that for a more thorough study we will need to delve into each planet a bit more, but this book was enough information on all the other topics it covers. The picture books on each planet by Seymour Simon are wonderful for getting more information on each planet and for their great illustrations.<br />The illustrations in this book are drawings, which are nice but not as great as some of the wonderful photographs that are available. I am granting this 4 stars due to the illustrations being all drawings, and because of the lack of detail on each planet. I suggest supplementing this book with at least browsing through some other books such as coffee table books or other adult books about space so that the child can get a different perspective and to appreciate the beauty that is captured in our modern high tech photography.	2004-02-05

I used this as a read aloud for my 6 year old and the content was fully understandable. This is a non-consumable puzzle book. My son enjoyed it and thought much more of it than I did.<br />The format is comic-book style with cartoon-like illustrations. The storyline is a bit silly. Two school children on a field trip to a space center walk into a horizontal-lying space shuttle, which then suddenly takes off and lands on the moon.  The shuttle is running on autopilot. The moon is inhabited by a human who was an engineer for the government; he runs an army of robots that attack the children. They escape unharmed and take off for Mars. En route they are hit by a comet, which results in minor damage to an external camera. They teach themselves to fix it while the shuttle continues on its' journey. When they arrive on Mars they meet \\"rock people\\" who are talking, walking red rocks with legs that talk backwards and eat rocks. Suddenly the man from the Moon appears and is happy to meet the rock people. He decides to live there. The boy and girl return to the ship. They are told they were accidentally locked inside for 20 minutes. Their pockets are full of proof that they really did go space traveling, though.<br />On each double-page spread there is a question that must be answered. Sometimes the answer lies on previous pages and other times it takes careful looking to find the answers.  An example is where did they see the man on the Moon before? Answer: his face was on a poster at the space center.<br />The entire storyline is silly and unrealistic. Children who love learning about space may not appreciate the parts that go against reality (i.e. a man living on the moon alone).  Most of the questions are not very challenging, even for a 6 year old.<br />This is one in a series by Usbourne.	2004-01-29

The book does not go into detail about the various kinds of sharks or where in the world they live, but we have a brief glimpse at the various kinds of sharks and we get a gist for the variety: from the gentle and slow-moving whale shark to the predator great white shark to the very strange, camouflage-capable wobblegong. Clear explanations of the anatomy of the sharks are given, fully understandable to my 6 year old. An example of what is thoroughly explained is how they get oxygen from the water, how the gills operate, and how the plankton eaters filter the plankton from the ocean. There are also interesting comparisons between fish and sharks, highlighting how they are different from one another.<br />The text is detailed and the writing style not dumbed-down or patronizing, which I appreciate. There are many full color photographs, some of which are downright gruesome! The cross-section of the heart and the cut-open stomach showing partially chewed-up contents was a bit much.<br />This was a great part of our homeschooling unit on sharks. It is very thorough regarding the anatomy of sharks. To get a broader overview of sharks, additional reading is required.	2004-01-29

Just enough text to keep the attention span of kids aged 6 and under. Illustrations are drawings and photographs. A nice addition to learning the history of our United States of America. The content focuses mainly on daily living such as who does what type of job and how people live, such as what their kitchens were like, how they cooked, and about how they dealt with the hazards of chimney and roof fires. Slavery is touched on very briefly and it is implied that all Colonials owned slaves.	2003-11-06

Glen Rounds both wrote and illustrated this true story about a summer that he and his sister spent trying to figure out how to get onto a gentle horse and ride it. The boy is about 8 and the girl looks to be about 6. The brother and sister have a close, loving relationship and they have a ball despite many thwarted efforts. These young children show wonderful problem-solving skills, creative thinking and perseverance. The old gentle horse even comes to love these children although he does not make it easy for them. Repeatedly they struggle to get their short bodies upon the horses' back only to slide off and fall to the ground (uninjured). My two boys aged 3 and 6 love this story and beg to hear it over and over. I found it by scanning the stacks at the public library; now we must buy our own copy to keep. Just a very cute story with simple themes, it is \\"good stuff\\" for the soul.	2003-11-06

The boy grows to love farm life and his relationship with his grandfather grows close as the year progresses. Life is simple and their farm life changes with the seasons. The family can barely afford to buy a turkey from a store for Thanksgiving (for $1.82). Grandfather has been trying to hunt the elusive tom turkey for years. Grandson accompanies Grandfather on numerous hunting trips without finding the elusive tom turkey. Finally before Thanksgiving the tom turkey makes his appearance and they are stunned to see how very old the tom turkey is (judging by the length of his beard). Before the boy can shoot, Grandfather intervenes to allow the old Tom to live, and they wonder if the Tom has lived in those woods for as long as Grandfather has.<br />A wonderful tale with stunning watercolor painting illustrations.

YIKES! This is a story that reinforces that children should be afraid of the dark and that crazy weird monster creatures ARE in the woods at night and they are real. The repeating stanza warns of this \\"You must not go to the wood at night\\". In the end the boy is safe but we are told again to not go into the wood at night. The monster looks like a werewolf man with claw hands and other scary weirdness.<br />The paintings are dark, eerie and scary.<br />I rate this one star because I think the subject matter and effective illustrations are completely inappropriate for a picture book for this age range. This book would be enforcing the notion that monsters do exist and that the dark IS to be something for young children to be afraid of.<br />Skip this one entirely unless your child is older (8 or more) and concretely understands that monsters are fictional, woods are not a scary place to be, night is not scary, and that this story is nothing but that, a fictional story (poem). Then again it may be useful to show how words and illustrations can be truly fiction and how the power of persuasion exists, especially enhanced by effective illustrations.	2003-09-30

After reading reviews questioning the authenticity of the content of this book, I did an Internet search for factual information. A source at the National Archives and Records Association of the USA shows an article by Jerry Clark, which contains information to support the text of this picture book by Susan Jeffers. That article is footnoted with references to source material. There is apparently a huge debate over the authenticity of what Chief Seattle did or did not say. Because I found information to support the content of this book, I will go ahead and do a review and grant it 5 stars for the eloquent text and beautiful illustrations.<br />Text is based on an adaptation of a speech made by Native American Chief Seattle to the new Commissioner of Indian Affairs, during negotiations between the white settlers and the Suquamish and Duwanish tribes in the 1850s. The speech tells of the views held by the ancient peoples, such as humans cannot own land or air or water. The sacredness of the earth and all of its' inhabitants is explained. The connectedness of the human Native Americans to the Earth is eloquently described. This speech is a plea that if they sell the land to the white men, that the land and animals not be ruined. This message is thought to be the first plea and a forewarning of ecology, as Chief Seattle pleas that the land be preserved for the enjoyment of future generations.<br />The first and last pages (an unlabeled introduction and an unlabeled afterward) are factual and historical explanations to explain the body of the text. The text itself is a wonderful and poetically written explanation of the views of the Native Americans. If one wishes to explain these beliefs to a child without getting into the historical elements, simply skip the introduction and the afterward, which may be recommended for reading to the very young who are not yet ready to grasp historical facts and concepts. (My three year old was enthralled with this book, and I think even a two year old would be interested in the main text.)<br />The illustrations are stunning and detailed and are difficult to describe.

The island is rainforest. The boy and his father enjoy the wilderness surroundings. The boy plays by exploring the rainforest alone and using his imagination to think about the creatures that inhabited this place in years gone by. The illustrations are creative as they show the imagined creatures as transparent. I loved the use of illustration in this way as we \\"see\\" what the boy was imagining. The story is very nice until the end. When the boy and his father are preparing to leave for the day, the next scene shows the future when the whole island is over-populated with tourist attractions and it shows two children sitting and eating in front of a TV set. This scene is in the imagination as the buildings and such are shown in transparencies.<br />I loved the story until the end. I think we need to think carefully what thoughts and concepts we are putting into our children's heads. This book is for ages 4-8 and is a picture book. Can we let them have some innocence and wonder before they learn of rainforest destruction? I don't recommend this book unless you skip the last page entirely! At what age is it appropriate for a child to be worrying about destroying rainforests in the name of tourism? My issue with the book is that it gets the reader excited about the Australian rainforest then gives them a punch by warning of rainforest destruction. This is a book with a message, it is obviously written to get children to to worry about serious envionmental threats at a (TOO) young age.	2003-09-26

Actually this follows the Tiwi tribe of Aboriginal peoples who live on a small island off the coast of Australia. High quality photographs accompany the text.<br />The format is \\"a day in the life of a child\\", and we follow a tribe who is doing their walkabout. The Tiwi tribe is nomadic and they take journeys called walkabouts, the same journey on foot that their ancestors walked. We see photos of, and text explains, such things as a mother telling a story to her daughter before bedtime near the fire, hunting for snakes and bandicoot. We see how children are equally responsible for hunting and gathering as their parents and grandparents. As the book progresses we learn of certain animals and reptiles that live in the area. We share in a ceremony to honor the dead and see the adults playing with the children at the beach.<br />The author learned this information by personally traveling with this tribe on their walkabout. The introduction and an afterward explain more details about that to the adults who are reading this book.<br />This is a wonderful book and it rounded out our studies of Australia.

Each topic is not covered enough. For example, a two page spread with 3 paragraphs of text attempts to discuss plants, animals, and birds! The two most commonly known animals of Australia are not even illustrated: the kangaroo and the koala.<br />The main focus of the book is the modern living environment of the non-Aboriginal citizens. Fifteen double-page spreads explain modern living such as shopping, sports and leisure, cities, and transportation. There is only one two-page spread about Aboriginal peoples, followed by a brief history of the European settlement.<br />The book doesn't even mention the Great Barrier Reef, nor does it mention the sea life or anything to do with the coast or the ocean that surrounds Australia.<br />The writing is extremely dry and boring and after skimming through it I decided it was not worth to read aloud to my children. The photographs are not even that great. I found many other excellent books about Australia, which we used in our home school instead.	2003-09-24

There are long captions for each photo so if your child is younger and won't sit to hear the longer text read aloud, you could just read the long captions and still get a good amount of information.<br />The front and back pages show a map of the world with all the coral reefs and which areas are under threat<br />I found this book interesting as most books on the life of animals on and around a coral reef focus on daytime only.

The book opens when Tutankhamen was a very young and sickly child. The author explains that this youngest son attended school but was unable to participate in very physical games due to his fragility. While Tut walked to his school he admired the temples, appreciated the fine art work which glorified the numerous Egyptian Gods and his spirituality grew. In the beginning of the story, his father, Amenhotep III was Pharaoh. Upon the death of his father (which is not really dealt with or discussed enough),Tut's older brother, Amenhotep IV, took over the throne. Under his rule, he banned worship of all God's except for the Sun God. Temples and artwork were destroyed and Tut was upset about this, as it seems was most of Egypt. Soon he was assassinated and Tut took over at the age of 9 or 10. The focus of the story is that Tut then restored the right of the people to worship multiple Gods and work began to restore and rebuild temples to all of the Gods. Tut seems to have been appreciated for this and his gift to the people was this act. The story ends there, with Tut still alive, young, and ruling Egypt.<br />In the teacher's notes at the end of the book, it states that Tut was killed at the age of 19 or 20 from a severe head injury, which is speculated to be either from a hunting accident or an intentional assignation. So the story does not go as far as his death, but it is mentioned in the endnote.<br />Since most of what people know of King Tut was of the riches found in his tomb, this book gives a different perspective of the important thing that King Tut did for his people. I think children will enjoy reading of a child King, and they will like the storytelling being in the time frame of before his rule and during his rule.<br />The artwork is bold and bright. The swirls and bold lines remind me of stained glass windows. There is a lot to look at and the illustrations certainly held our interest.<br />My 6 year-old son enjoyed this story as an accompaniment to learning about Ancient Egypt. The story about a young boy that became King was a refreshing change from the usual spin and perspective found in most books, which can be dry or portraying Egyptians as just mummies and the idea that Egypt is just desert and pyramids.ing about Ancient Egypt.

All of the illustrations are Van Gogh's famous paintings. We see the exterior of the building he rented, the interior of his rented room, sights he saw as he walked, on and on throughout his day. Woven amongst the daily events are facts about this famous artist and explanations as to why he used his unique technique and signature bright colors.<br />The style of writing makes this suitable for reading aloud to children aged 3 and up. The story is easy to read but is not patronizing in tone. It is perfect for a first biography about Van Gogh for young children. It is also interesting to hear what children have to say in reaction to Van Gogh's unique artwork. My sons loved hearing this book, at ages 3 and 6.	2003-09-11

Often a parent who is planning to homeschool has the same greatest fear: how will they teach the child to read?  Reading these 28 pages will not take long and the wisdom contained in it is unbelievable. Beechick cuts to the chase and minces no words when it comes to boiling down how to teach reading with the phonetic method. She points the finger at curriculum companies that lead parents to believe that teaching a child to read is difficult and that it requires purchasing expensive curriculum.<br />In this little booklet Beechick tells you all you need to know to teach your child to read. Her writing is concise and she doesn't waste time, space, or add to confusion by repeating herself. The language of the book is very simple and easy to understand, making this a fast read. Her method is laid out very simply and directly. Beechick feels that a parent can take this information and use homemade flashcards to teach a child to read. If you choose her method, you will spend less than $10, maybe even less than $5 total to teach your child to read, mostly due to the inexpensive price of this booklet and the inexpensive blank flash cards that you will use to make your own flashcards.<br />Beechick also gives instructions for doing your own testing to assess your child's independent reading level and their reading comprehension level. With this fast and easy method you can quickly tell if a book you select from a library or bookstore is below, at, or above your child's reading ability level. This little test is so easy that you can teach a very young child to give themself a test while standing in a library or store with the questionable book in hand. I love this idea, as it does not make the parent reliant on finding lists of books graded by ability level; the child can select books with subjects they are interested in reading about, and see if they are capable of reading them. In this manner the child can select books that they can read easily for relaxing practice or select books that give some challenge to help build their reading ability in a gradual way.<br />If you have already begun to read about how to teach a child to read and are feeling confused and overwhelmed, then take the time now to read this book. If you have also purchased some curriculum and feel it isn't a good fit with your child and you may be panicking, now is the time to read this book! That is the place I was at when I found out about this booklet, bought it and read it. I felt as if the heavy fog of conflicting reading instruction theory and opinion was instantly lifted. In this booklet Beechick lays out the basics of teaching a child to read in a systematic method, step by step. Teaching reading is portrayed as completely do-able for any person to follow. No degree in education or reading instruction is needed to help a child learn to read.<br />Beechick doesn't get into debating theory about whole language, sight-reading, vs. phonetic reading methods. She doesn't get into the history of reading instruction in America nor does she state statistics of good or bad literacy rates. She just tells the reader how easy it is to teach reading. She also explains how to tell if a child is ready to read or not.<br />Finding this same information in another source is not easy; I have not yet found it anywhere else. I have been reading about how to teach a child to read, in homeschooling magazines, books, and in online articles for three years, and never have I found such a wonderful resource until I found this booklet. Many of the articles and books about teaching a child to read are about theory, followed by the author is laying out their own opinion and argument for following their preferred way.  Many of the reading curriculum programs tell the parent what to do, but not why. Without understanding the basic steps of learning to read with the phonetic method, if you want to buy a packaged curriculum, it is difficult to make an informed choice. Beechick makes it clear you may teach a child to read using homemade materials but she also says if you want to buy a program, go ahead and do so!<br />This book is perfect for homeschooling parents who are responsible for teaching their child to read. However it is also equally useful for any parent if the parent is interested in teaching their child to read outside of school, or to help the child read while the child is learning to read in school. If a child is having trouble learning to read in school, this booklet provides information that can help the parent work with the child at home.

Friends and family are visiting her parents and giving presents to the newborn baby. After they leave Sara's mother nurses the baby. We see tidbits of Sara's life as she grows into adulthood, her graduation from school, her wedding. Later when Sara gives birth to her baby boy, she is showered with gifts from friends and family. When alone with the baby, she nurses her newborn while Sara ponders that \\"the best gifts can never be bought\\".<br />I loved the theme that breastfeeding is one of the best gifts that a baby can receive. The book is written in a sweet style. The illustrations are pretty, in pastel tones.<br />It is difficult to find picture books for children that portray breastfeeding; this is a nice book to fit that niche. The two babies in the book are nursed as newborns, there is no mention of when they stopped; it does not address nursing to a certain age or anything. There are no bottles portrayed in this book.<br />My complaint is that the two nursing scenes occur when the mother is in a nightgown, which reinforces some people's opinion that nursing mothers must be in their nightgowns all the time in order to nurse or that they must always stay at home to nurse. Additionally the mother chooses to button her nightgown from the top down, exposing her chest..., which perpetuates another notion that in order to breastfeed the mother must completely expose herself. Please realize that nursing can be done with real clothes on, in a discreet manner that leaves the mother covered for both her own comfort and for the comfort of others. Nursing can be done at any time of the day and anywhere, in public or private, in a more discreet manner than is portrayed in this book. (See the cover illustration for an idea of how the nursing scene is illustrated throughout this book.)<br />Despite my issues I still rate this as 5 stars for the quality of the writing, the quality of the illustration, and the wonderful message that this book communicates.book communicates.	2003-08-19

She talks of the darkness in the room. Then they move out into the hall and outside, each step along the way she is pointing out what is in the darkness (the same things as were there when it was light). When they go outdoors they see both wild animals and farm animals and they see what they are doing in the dark. In the beginning the rhyme points to one item, then goes up to ten as the pages are turned. The last page summarizes that all the animals are \\"safe and still and warm, deep in the dark and free from harm, in the dark of the midnight farm\\".<br />The text does not say so but it is apparent that the little boy was afraid of the dark and that this is the mothers' creative way to show him what is happening in the dark and that \\"life goes on\\" in the dark and that everyone and everything is safe in the dark. The last image is of the boy sleeping in his bedroom alone while mother looks over him.<br />The illustrations are beautiful. My children and I loved the rhyme and the repetitive nature, along with the counting up from one to ten.<br />Despite the publisher's age range, I feel this is fine for two year old's.	2003-07-09

It starts with one animal and builds to a family of 10 animals. Animals that live in a meadow are presented which includes: turtle, red fox, robin, chipmunk, honeybee, beaver, frog/pollywogs, owl, spiders and rabbits.<br />At the end the musical score for singing this as a song and all the lyrics are printed.<br />The illustrations are lovely and unique. Some are full colored and others are pencil-gray with a yellowish color.<br />My children loved the singsong rhyming with the obvious cadence. The last illustration is of a scary predator-owl swooping down upon many of the animals, which are trying to run away! But that is all part of the life of the animals in the meadow!	2003-07-08

As with all Eyewitness books, the photographs are lovely. However, they concentrate mostly on large images of butterflies and moths, concentrating mostly on their beauty, rather than showing more close range photos that show body parts. Most annoying is the complete lack of a photographic and text chronological process of egg to caterpillar to chrysalis to butterfly or moth. How can they leave this out? They show bits and pieces of the life stage scattered throughout the text, which I found confusing and disjointed. If an adult is confused or lacking a feeling of thoroughness, I wonder that the children aged 4-8 which the publisher has this categorized for will think.<br />I advise to skip this book completely and move on to \\"Eyewitness Butterfly and Moth\\" which is slotted for ages 9-12 (but my younger children are able to handle as a read-aloud). That book has more detail and more of the wonderful beautiful photographs.<br />As a comparison, the book for children titled \\"Life of a Butterfly\\" by Heiderrose and Andreas Fischer-Nagel does a superb job of showing high quality photographs of the life cycle. There are more stages than I was expecting and detailed photos such as the caterpillar shedding its' skin.	2003-07-01

Children who are familiar with some or all of Laura's stories (or the TV show) will delight in hearing of her entire life. I have yet to meet a child who does not delight in Laura's life and stories. Even if a child has read the Little House series of books, there is something new to learn here as her life continued beyond what we know from the Little House series.<br />If a child has never heard of Laura before, I suspect that they may not be very interested in this book because the challenge of cramming a biography covering 90 years of a person's life within the publishing industry standard of a 32 page picture book, has hindered the author's ability to present many captivating stories and interesting details about her life. They may also not \\"get\\" the interest in her life (in particular) and perhaps may view this more as a story of \\"just\\" a life of a pioneer girl in more of a historical context of hearing what life was like in America back then. There is much to learn about \\"just\\" the Pioneer Days aspect of this book, though. (Although my wish is that all children would read and know the wonderful stories contained in the Little House series.) The book doesn't really capture the unique and endearing qualities of Laura's personality and it is not a funny book. The text sometimes seems to rush through her life seeming to mostly focus on why they decided to move to a new place and what they liked there and then repeating the format through her many moves. (Those of us who already know these basics about her life won't see a problem with this, it will then be seen as more of a nice synopsis and summary of her life.)<br />There is a greater amount of text per page than in most picture books; perhaps explaining why the publisher has determined this is for a 9-12 age range. However, the font size is quite large and the language and information is so watered down that a 3 or 4 year old could understand it. What suffers here is the illustrations. The illustrations sometimes are of a more boring scene in the opposing page than could have been chosen. For example one page shows Laura and Mary doing homework at the kitchen table and while that is a part of the opposing pages' text, so is the more dramatic story of a terrible blizzard, which forced the family and other families to live together in the town building. While the people were starving, two boys (one being Almonzo Wilder) risked their lives by braving the storm to get food for everyone, not only surviving themselves but saving the lives of the townspeople. It seems to me that this exciting story would have made a better illustration.<br />As a read aloud, my two boys aged three and five sat quietly to listen to this story, they are familiar with the Little House chapter books and with the reruns of the TV show from the 1970s. They both enjoyed this story, as did I. If you want more details of Laura's life I advise you to read the entire Little House series of chapter books. I feel that children as young as 2.5 or 3 enjoy that series of books as a read-aloud. There are also books on the market that discuss Laura and her daughter Rose's life in much more detail if you are interested. There are also craft books and cookbooks as a companion to the Little House series.<br />I appreciated the author's focus on trying to capture what life was like in Pioneer days. The author did a great job at expressing the hardships of life and really appreciating how much physical hard work must be done to survive. He portrayed the hopes and dreams of Laura's father, why they wanted to move to a certain place, why they had to move on, etc. There were always good reasons for doing a certain thing. The strong family bond is very apparent and their love for each other is very clear, for example, when Laura was 15 and working as a teacher and lived away from her familyshe missed them and was happy to come home on weekends to be with them. Laura's adult life was full of change and adapting, and both she and Almonzo's commitment to do hard work in order to survive is expressed. ...<br />This book summarizes Laura's life, explains the values and commitment they all shared, and expresses the difficulty of life in Pioneer Days. It is interesting for both Laura-fans and for anyone interested in learning about life in the American Pioneer Days.she missed them and was happy to come home on weekends to be with them.

(The other customer review and the professional reviews contain a very good summary of the entire story so I won't repeat it.) When I found this in the library I was excited to find a picture book of an orphan singer from Venice. My children have been listening to the music and story CD \\"Vivaldi's Ring of Mystery\\" from the Classical Kids collection and they love that story which is about the orphanage, which is also a school of music. My older son has been asking to learn more about Venice and Vivaldi so I thought this may be a great addition to learn more about it, in a fiction children's picture book format.<br />I didn't like that the main character was not truly an orphan. The poverty stricken family had an older son who had a lovely voice so they were happy but not totally surprised when their baby daughter also had a naturally lovely singing voice. Knowing they were unable to pay for singing lessons or musical schooling, when she was just a baby they anonymously gave her to the musical school/orphanage so she could develop her talents, albeit growing up without a family. Frankly I think it is more important for a baby and a person to grow up in a loving family than to be given up by their parents to be raised in an orphanage. My children seemed a bit perplexed about this as the values of this family put a singing career above providing basic love to a baby from its own parents, since the concept of giving a baby away to be raised by strangers 24/7, is so foreign to them.<br />There is also the issue of honesty. Thinking about this further, I wonder if this girl who did have a family took a spot in the orphanage that could have been filled by a real orphan who also had natural musical talent...<br />If this baby were a real orphan who had an admiring family watching her performances and if the story were taken from there it would have been better, and would have worked very well, in my opinion.<br />In the end she does end up as a famous singer and as an adult she spends time with them, loves them, and financially supports them: so all are happy. The ending seems to be an effort to make everything seem perfect and the issues of being raised apart from the family seem non-existent and unimportant. It also seems to put the notion of financial success above a basic need for forming healthy attachment relationships in infancy and throughout childhood.<br />The illustrations are absolutely beautiful. The writing is high quality; I just don't like the foundation of the story.<br />(About my rating, quality of writing style would get a 5, storyline would get a 1, and the illustrations would get a 5. So I've come up with a 3 to rate it as a whole!)up as a famous singer and as an adult she spends time with them, loves them, and financially supports them: so all are happy.

The story is mediocre and contains violent scenes--I usually don't read stories with violent content to my children. The original Little Toot book contained no violence.<br />Little Toot the tugboat is driving around Venice while we learn of some unique aspects about life in Venice. The last thing we learn is that there are still special police who are in charge of watching and protecting the city from pirates. It states that there are no more pirates. Suddenly, though, there are pirates who arrive and begin stealing jewels and other treasures in the city. The police pursue the pirates and there are scenes of sword fighting, and gun fighting, with numerous scenes of bullets flying around the air. The police fail and while they are getting ready to sail away, Little Toot comes to the rescue. Oddly, after breathing in air from the glass blowing factory, he is able to puff out beautiful glass balls instead of smoke. The pirates want the glass balls, and in their greed, and as they try run after them, they ran right into the prison and were jailed. The message is that greed led to their undoing. Because Little Toot saved the day and was given a prize for his help, his favorite decoration in Venice, a candystick cane.	2003-06-30

After reading and loving Bantock's Griffin &amp; Sabine trilogy I stumbled upon this book. I was thrilled to learn background information straight from the author. I loved the trilogy but was left curious about the author and the works of art themselves. I enjoyed seeing his work develop over time and found it interesting to read about how he got started in his professional art career. I also appreciate his candid comments about the publishing industry and that he shared some negative opinions of his work with us-it shows he is not arrogant or an egomaniac!<br />I loved that the images are laid out chronologically. This book contains a lot of previously published work but that is fine with me-how else would he discuss his works if we could not look at them while reading about them?!? I liked reading what led him to begin working on a certain project or what drew him to continue working with a medium (i.e. designing his own stamps). I liked hearing where he gathers pieces to use in his collages and how he puts his collages together. After reading this book I have an even deeper appreciation for his books and artwork.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this cover-to-cover and delighting in his gorgeous artwork. It is truly inspirational. As a person who is naturally better at writing than making art, I envy Bantock's ability to make such beautiful and thoughtful artwork!	2003-06-25

Definitions are given to easy (common) terms such as saplings, seedlings, limbs, and the trunk. Leaves of 27 different trees are identified. The book is way too oversimplified to be very useful; for example, it states things live in three zones in a forest, the ground, the middle branches, and the upper branches, but it does not give examples of what lives in these zones.<br />I was very disappointed in the content of this book.  It is way too dumbed-down. Perhaps it would be useful for the very young reader (2 years old through 4) who has no knowledge of trees at all. I felt that other than knowing (all of) the different leaf identifications, my five year-old already knows this information based on casual conversation and his own observation!<br />The illustrations are hand drawn and charming, and the main character is an elderly man named Crinkleroot who gives a mysterious and weird explanation that he was born in a tree.	2003-06-25

When I found this book the beautiful cover and the title excited me. I was looking for a book that had activities having to do with trees and thought this would be perfect.<br />The beautiful cover is similar to the nice color photographs that are in the 8-page centerpiece. The rest (majority) of the illustrations are black and white boring photographs or are simple line drawings. The photos of the flowering trees would have been more appreciated if they were in color!<br />The text is very boring, reminding me of the textbooks I used in my public school education. The author writes in a very dry and boring manner. The book covers information about trees in good depth but unfortunately the text is dry. I also found the very short sentences used with double columns per page made for difficult reading, much like reading a newspaper article.<br />I was most annoyed that the title states there are year-round activities. There are only a handful of activities and they are the same old basic activities it seems everyone already knows about, gathering leaves to press, ironing them between layers of waxed paper, etc. These activities are buried into the text and are not highlighted in the table of contents or the index.	2003-06-25

A tribe is starving and suffering with a lack of food and enduring a drought. The tribe's shaman has died and she passed the job onto her adolescent daughter named Mishoo. Fearing this responsibility, she has chosen not to \\"catch dreams\\" which is apparently the cause of both the drought and the lack of hunting success. Finally Mishoo follows the commands given by her mother and grandmother in her dreams...she goes to a sacred cave. Once in the cave she builds a fire and sees how the rock walls seem to come alive with shapes of animals. She uses her gathered clays to paint the walls.<br />The writing is poetic and eerie. The illustrations are gorgeous and set the mood perfectly.<br />When Mishoo returns to her tribe after three days of painting, it has just begun to rain. The rain will stimulate growth of the grasses, which will lure the animals back to the land. It ends by saying their hunting was successful and the tribe is thriving again.<br />Both the writing and the artwork drew us in and made us feel a part of the story. This is the first fiction historical book for children that I have found. It is the perfect addition to our homeschool curriculum for learning about early man and cave paintings.<br />Both my 3 and 5 year old boys enjoyed this story, although I needed to explain some of the passages such as what \\"moon of the singing grass\\" and \\"dream catcher\\" meant. I loved the way the author captured an artist's imagination and ability to imagine and \\"see\\" the finished piece before even starting work on it, how the rock walls seemed to speak to her and how she then created what she already saw in her mind's eye. This type of explanation is seldom seen in children's literature; I appreciated that.<br />A list of suggested related readings and background information about cave paintings are included at the end of the book.<br />We read this after borrowing it from the public library and we loved it so much, we must own a copy for our home library!ublic library and we loved it so much, we must own a copy for our home library!	2003-06-25

There is one half page of blank lines to write in. The concentration here is to write about nature and to do activities related to nature and to document those as well (rather than drawing or painting what is seen).  At the bottom of that same page is the author's own dated eco-journal entry. For our inspiration, the author presents what she has written when observing nature in her own 20 acre, wooded backyard located in Pennsylvania.  The author suggests that children document what they see, even a short listing such as when a tree first blooms, when an animal such as a deer is spotted, etc. Also suggested are longer descriptions and poetry. There is a whole page of ideas of what to write about from reports about a favorite animal to writing a book report on a nature book that was read.<br />The book begins with tips and encouragement to observe nature. The author urges us to spend time observing the same place on a regular basis (daily or weekly), so we can see the many changes that occur over short and long periods of time.<br />In addition to having writing space there are directions for 24 activities. Some of the activities are how to grow tadpoles indoors, making a map of a place in nature that will be visited regularly, pressing flowers and how to construct and maintain a birdhouse. The authors have a desire for children to become conversationalists and discussions of endangered species and how children can help save whales and wildflowers, among other things, is presented. I was confused by the page devoted to collecting birds' nests, as it is still illegal in America to do so, even if one is not being used presently. (Some birds deconstruct nests and use the same materials to build new nests.) A page about caring for wounded wildlife is amongst the activities.<br />I like this book and appreciate the easy to understand information and activities. However I prefer that a journal have more freedom, to make longer or shorter entries, more entries, and to have blank pages for drawing or sketching. For our family I have decided to use this book as a non-consumable reference book and to use a different type of blank book as an eco-journal.<br />There seems to be several (or many) books that provide lists and directions for nature activities. The unique thing about this book is the strong urge to have a child be an observer and writer of what is seen. This book provides the seeds to let a child open up to seeing and appreciating our natural world.  To treat animals and our environment with respect and admiration is clearly a goal. There are many tips and ideas to prompt journal entries. I would say the main strong point of this book is the emphasis on stimulating a desire to create an eco-journal-the activities are secondary. You don't need to do all the activities, they are separate from the writing, however, doing them may excite the child about nature or be the basis of something to write about.However I prefer that a journal have more freedom, to make longer or shorter entries, more entries, and to have blank pages for drawing or sketching.

Colorful hand-drawn graphics are throughout the book, such as showing the parts of a tree, the difference between deciduous and evergreen trees, and single and compound leaves.

It does not mention that sugar maple trees produce maple syrup-a way to get a food out of a non-flowering deciduous tree is interesting and something that kids would like to know.

The language is pretty simple and it is a short book (32 pages). Perhaps this would be a good read-aloud as one part of a unit study or to act as a first non-fiction lesson for young children about trees.

US	51212167	R2QNK0XMLZECWO	0964074230	304054269	A Kid's Spring Ecojournal: With Nature Activities for Exploring the Season	Books	5	7	7	N	N	encourages kids to write about nature, includes activities	This book is meant to be a consumable eco-journal (aka nature notebook; nature journal or discovery journal). There is one half page of blank lines to write in. The concentration here is to write about nature and to do activities related to nature and to document those as well (rather than drawing or painting what is seen).  At the bottom of that same page is the author's own dated eco-journal entry. For our inspiration, the author presents what she has written when observing nature in her own 20 acre, wooded backyard located in Pennsylvania.  The author suggests that children document what they see, even a short listing such as when a tree first blooms, when an animal such as a deer is spotted, etc. Also suggested are longer descriptions and poetry. There is a whole page of ideas of what to write about from reports about a favorite animal to writing a book report on a nature book that was read. <br />The book begins with tips and encouragement to observe nature. The author urges us to spend time observing the same place on a regular basis (daily or weekly), so we can see the many changes that occur over short and long periods of time. <br />In addition to having writing space there are directions for 24 activities. Some of the activities are how to grow tadpoles indoors, making a map of a place in nature that will be visited regularly, pressing flowers and how to construct and maintain a birdhouse. The authors have a desire for children to become conversationalists and discussions of endangered species and how children can help save whales and wildflowers, among other things, is presented. I was confused by the page devoted to collecting birds' nests, as it is still illegal in America to do so, even if one is not being used presently. (Some birds deconstruct nests and use the same materials to build new nests.) A page about caring for wounded wildlife is amongst the activities.<br />I like this book and appreciate the easy to understand information and activities.However I prefer that a journal have more freedom, to make longer or shorter entries, more entries, and to have blank pages for drawing or sketching. For our family I have decided to use this book as a non-consumable reference book and to use a different type of blank book as an eco-journal. <br />There seems to be several (or many) books that provide lists and directions for nature activities. The unique thing about this book is the strong urge to have a child be an observer and writer of what is seen. This book provides the seeds to let a child open up to seeing and appreciating our natural world.  To treat animals and our environment with respect and admiration is clearly a goal. There are many tips and ideas to prompt journal entries. I would say the main strong point of this book is the emphasis on stimulating a desire to create an eco-journal-the activities are secondary. You don't need to do all the activities, they are separate from the writing, however, doing them may excite the child about nature or be the basis of something to write about.	2003-06-15

I was not having fertility problems but before reading this book was going on information from my OB/GYN about how to achieve pregnancy regarding timing of relations and the \\"window of opportunity\\" for conception. I figured I'd read the book for the heck of it to see if there was something useful in it that went above and beyond the information my doctor already provided me with.<br />I was happy to find a very easy to read format and very understandable information. I was surprised to find different information regarding timing of relations with ovulation than my own doctor had given me. Specifically I learned that if I followed my doctor's method, conception would be far less likely to take place (according to the author/doctor) than if I followed the information recommended in his book. I learned the details of the fertility cycle and specific information about using (the inexpensive) ovulation predictor kits to help narrow down the fertility \\"window\\". At the time, I thought it humorous to read of intentional gender selection. I learned that gender selection does have a scientific reason and factors under the control of the woman and man can determine the gender of the baby. I did have a thought that a certain gender as a firstborn would be nice. I decided to follow the instructions in the book exactly and see if I'd conceive a certain gender. With the use of (the least expensive) ovulation predictor kits from the drug store I was happy to achieve pregnancy on the first month of following these directions. Additionally I ended conceiving a baby of my \\"choice\\" of gender, after following the instructions for that gender.<br />Women talk to each other about pregnancy and infertility; it is a natural thing between women, especially between pregnant women and women who are already mothers. As my friends and co-workers would tell me of their infertility problems or mention they want to begin trying, I explained that this book helped me, and I recommended that they read this book and educate themselves rather than just follow what their OB/GYN or Infertility specialist said to do. (I did not and am not recommending to ignore a doctor's advice, but to supplement it with self-knowledge obtained by reading this book.) Eleven women that I lent my book to ended up pregnant after reading this book and following the directions regarding timing, understanding their fertility cycle, and general nutritional recommendations. (I was so surprised at the success rate that I kept track of the numbers.) The women undergoing infertility treatment and procedures told me this book recommended more frequent intercourse than their own doctors did. The women who wanted a certain gender followed those instructions and every one of them conceived the gender they tried for. The women who didn't have a gender preference achieved pregnancy with a \\"surprise\\" gender and were happy.<br />What bothered me about the book was the detailed information about miscarriage and infertility treatments. Since I was not officially considered infertile I didn't have an interest in this and found those sections scary. I chose stop reading those chapters because at that point I was not considered medially \\"infertile\\". Instead I concentrated on the lifestyle recommendations that were definitely under my control such as nutrition, what to avoid eating or being exposed to, fertility cycle information, and conception and gender selection tips. My point is that this book is helpful even if you have not yet officially begun trying to conceive and is still helpful if you are not officially deemed \\"infertile\\".<br />Knowledge is power. I feel that every person should educate themselves about issues they are concerned with. Even if you are seeking the advice of a doctor or even an infertility specialist, I recommend you educate yourself about the topic. This is a very good book about achieving pregnancy, read it! Don't just rely on experts, become informed yourself. The price of this book is so much lower than expensive ovulation predictor kits and ovulation predictor computer programs. Rather than immediately think there is something wrong with your body, read this book first and see if you really are setting yourself up for success. Before rushing off to get a consult with an infertility specialist read this and make sure you have been \\"doing things right\\".  If you have already been diagnosed with an infertility problem, then you definitely should read this and educate yourself, as it will help you have meaningful discussions and more able to make informed choices when talking with your infertility specialist.ok about achieving pregnancy, read it!

The tiny strokes that make up the Egyptian hieroglyphics, the plant leaves, and the wall decorations are unbelievable. Great care and thought was given to both the drawings and the painting. The painting of the background of the pages and of the skies contain beautiful combinations of color.<br />Unfortunately I don't think the writing matches the quality of the illustrations.

I actually was laughing out loud while reading some of it. My intentions to feed my children healthy food have been a problem since they turned one year old! I am ashamed to admit my kids live on water, chicken nuggets, bread, and minimal fruit and vegetables.<br />I was disappointed that there was no nutritional content for the recipes. I was curious about that because many recipes are laden with (what I consider lots of) dairy! There seems to be an over-reliance on recipes that contain butter (in large amounts), cream cheese, shredded cheese, or sour cream. For example the puffy pancake contains 2 Tablespoons of butter per serving. The Oven Fried Chicken also has 2 Tablespoons of butter per serving. There are many recipes with a lot of butter and/or other dairy products. It seems to me that the success of most of these recipes lies in that most children love to eat cheese and other dairy products, so it is added to almost everything.<br />Many of the recipes are more appealing to me than my children. Because my children have dairy and soy allergies, unfortunately, most of these recipes cannot be converted for their use! (Many substitutes for cow milk products cannot be baked, for example.) If your children have dairy allergies or sensitivities or if you are looking for foods with a lower fat content, this may not be the book for you. If your kids love cheese and dairy products and are at all open to trying new foods, you probably will have more success with this cookbook than I did!	2003-02-24

The book discusses the type of houses that were used, the yard, how they sit to eat, what type of food they ate, how they cleaned up, and how they didn't have electricity. Some other facts are how they went fishing, the types of boats they used, types of tools they had, how they harvested crops and what people did \\"for a living\\" back then. These are not stories out of the Bible.<br />The illustrations are cartoon-like and nothing special.<br />The writing is geared toward beginning readers. The compromise here is that the information is overly simplified and dumbed down.<br />Our children prefer to get much more detailed information from books with real photos such as the Eyewitness series of books which are supposedly for the 9-12 age range. I find using the Eyewitness books as a read-aloud with my children, beginning at age one is preferred by them and me. At the time they are one year old, I allow them to ask questions about the pictures and I read as much as I can before they turn the page. Also starting at one year old, both of my children loved to look over the Eyewitness books by themselves and study the pictures, and would ask me questions about what they were looking at. Eyewitness has books on prehistoric life, early man, Ancient Egypt, and others.<br />The only benefit to this book is that a beginning reader can read this to himself or herself. I wonder what is better: to read a book with more detailed content aloud or to have them read an overly simplified book to themselves? I am not sure what the correct answer is. Perhaps the best answer is to have a child read this book to themselves if they are truly interested in reading this type of content to themselves, and to supplement with the more detailed read-aloud books.	2003-02-24

Just know this is not for children's tree houses or play houses. These are very rustic retreats, such as a lean-to to use as a nature retreat, or for the shack-like building the size of a garden shed for sleeping in as a weekend getaway,(sans electricity or toilets).<br />The one I loved the most was a rustic arbor for grapevines that was basically 4 poles with a semi-roof--for the vines to grow up and over the top to form a roof. The idea of sitting under it with a table and relaxing outdoors was quite tempting. However, where I would get the rustic tree trunks to make this is beyond me (but it looked wonderful).<br />There are no photographs. This is not a glitzy-beautiful tempting type of book. It is about the nuts and bolts of really building one of these structures. I suggest browsing this book first to see if there is a structure you are interested in.<br />The plans are quite detailed and seem more than adequate to use as building plans.	2003-01-23

Smith has gathered games and advice for presenting breastfeeding classes. This is a source of inspiration and an aid for breastfeeding instructors.  This book is a tool to use to help design and deliver professional-style presentations that are spiced up with games and activities in lieu of a straightforward lecture.<br />Smith feels that using games and activities adds an element of fun to the learning experience, increases the learners' attention span, and aids with the retention of the presented information. Smith has combined auditory, kinesthetic, and visual elements to appeal to the three different learning modalities.<br />Chapter one contains basic presentation skills combined with Smith's tips based on her many years of experience as an instructor and as a Lactation Consultant. Smith covers the structure, flow, and appropriate timing of each component of the presentation. (This information is pretty standard. If you already have read or learned the components of presentation skills this will be repetitious for you. If you have no training in presentation skills, this is useful information for you.)  Discussion about the use of breastfeeding props, and the pro's and con's of using audio-visual equipment are included.<br />The challenge of deciding what to present is acknowledged as a common stumbling block. With all we know about breastfeeding, it can be hard to decide how to limit content to fit within a certain time frame. Smith provides good tips about how to pare down everything we want to present.<br />In Chapter Two, Smith provides five icebreaker activities to choose from. Later chapters contain six games for use with the general public and fourteen games for presenting specific topics or concepts in depth (such as to health care professionals or lay breastfeeding counselors who already know about breastfeeding). The last chapter contains ten games for any audience that contains \\"neat and nifty ideas from master teachers from around the world\\" which \\"convey the uniqueness of BF in creative and effective ways\\".<br />All of the games and activities in the book are well organized and easy to understand. Key information is easily scanned on the first page: the goal, the best audience for the game, the amount of time required to play, and how to play. Details such as trivia facts with source citations are included. Almost every game is complete and requires no research on the part of the presenter. However, thought must go into the planning of the presentation and some prep work with game pieces, game cards, etc. may need to be prepared ahead of time. Smith also recommends a practice run-through before the actual presentation.<br />Some examples of the activities are: learning the composition of breastmilk, really hearing what a mother is trying to communicate with sample statements, figuring out if a medication is compatible with breastfeeding, and how to evaluate research studies about breastfeeding. Games for the general public include a handful related to emotions such as exploring negative feeling related to feeding choices or past guilt about not breastfeeding. There is a breastfeeding trivia game complete with questions and answers. For games where the attendees discuss opinions or emotions, Smith includes the typical answers and details to elaborate on them. The games are categorized into trivia type games, multiple choice questions, and fill in the blank questions. Some games require the players to use breastfeeding references to look up answers and come to conclusions.<br />This book can save loads of prep time by giving all that is needed to play these creative and informative teaching games. Smith's years of experience in the field of lactation are obvious.<br />The only complaint one may have is that for the price, the reader may have wished for more presentations for different audiences. Meaning if you only want presentations for the general public you may wish there were more or if you only want presentations for breastfeeding counselors you may wish there were more. What is here is of high quality and very detailed, and still will save you loads of prep time.ntations for the general public you may wish there were more or if you only want presentations for breastfeeding counselors you may wish there were more.

This book is not a book of plans or a quick-read instruction manual of how to build tree houses. This is a serious book about the most important part of the process: the planning.<br />Nelson begs us to realize that first we must select the tree(s) and that the characteristics of the tree(s) will dictate what size and type of structure can be built. Nelson includes information about which trees are best suited for building in, taking their strength and growing characteristics. This is great information to know, and something I think my tree landscaping books don't include. We learn that the growth of some trees will actually crush the structure over time, while others are too weak to safely hold up a structure, let alone one with people inside it.<br />The key element in this book is safety. Nelson gives detailed information about how to build a structure that is safe to inhabit, whether it is a playhouse for children or an actual house for adults to use to work or live in. I was surprised to see that some of the tree houses in the book are for actually living in and working in!<br />Several different methods to attach the structure to the tree are outlined in detail. Exactly what type and how many tree \\"attachments\\" to use is explained, such as too many direct nailings into the tree will kill it. I think this information is key.<br />Looking at the plans for the tree houses in the book, I realized the quality of the workmanship surpasses houses that I have lived in. These are not quick slap-up tree houses, not the type where you use scrap wood that you have lying around. The houses featured have fine edgings, safe banisters and ladders for climbing, beautiful doors and windows. Some have balconies!<br />Anyone considering building a tree house should read this book first lest they waste their time building a tree house that later kills the tree, ends up being not-secure, or is flat out unsafe for people to use. As a non-carpenter, frankly I am feeling intimidated and doubt I have trees on my property that are worthy!flat out unsafe for people to use.

As a breastfeeding counselor I have a personal interest in the history of infant feeding in America. I truly am interested in how and why Americans got away from breastfeeding in the early 1900s.<br />I found the book extremely boring and could not finish it. There is no introduction and the book lacks a general logical sequential flow. I found it difficult to hold my interest, as I had no sense of where the author was going with this book. The writing is very dry and only the very dedicated reader would read it through to the end. I wondered what the authors overall opinions are. Why did she want to write this book? What is the broad summary of the books content? What are her opinions after doing all this research and writing this book? It reads like a long string of facts rather than having a story-telling type of style.  It also lacks the authors opinion.<br />Before I began reading this book, I was perplexed by the title.  I felt that the title implies is if the baby is not breastfed the baby will die. Since we are living in the present day, I wondered if the author was implying that a non-breastfed baby born now would die if not breastfed; that was my first impression. I read ahead to find out that the title is based on an early 1900s public health dept. campaign to promote breastfeeding and discourage feeding baby cow milk supplements in lieu of breastmilk. This was at a time when the shipping and storage conditions of cow milk were so poor that much of the cow milk that was available to parents to feed their babies was high in bacteria that resulted in many babies becoming ill and with large numbers dying because of the infection. It should also be noted that this campaign that said, Dont kill your baby also encouraged the infant not to smoke cigars and from drinking beer. On page 125 the poster ad-campaign image is given and it advises that parents avoid meat, bread, potatoes, fruit, sweets, coffee, tea, beer, etc. and avoid the dread summer complaint. The image also includes what looks to me like a cigar. The promotion side of the ad states mothers milk is best of all, lots of cool bottled water to drink, clean milk (properly prepared) from a clean bottle give only these and a baby will keep well.  I found the image and the message very bizarre! I can understand wanting to reduce infant mortality but this campaign recommending against not giving a cigar and beer to a newbornvery strange! Yet the ad was not being extremist in recommending only breastfeeding, they had instructions for bottle feeding of clean milkvery strange, as we all know, bacteria are invisible to the human eye and how could parents know which milk was not-tainted vs. tainted? The fact that the title of the book would be pulled from that bizarre ad campaign makes me question the entire books worth.<br /><br />This is a documentation of the Chicago areas public health departments efforts to promote breastfeeding in the 20th century and the negative impact on not breastfeeding (i.e. increased infant mortality).

US	51212167	R8X2CA3LC2WIT	0380976196	347221724	Bruce Springsteen: Songs	Books	5	22	25	N	N	Springsteen's short essays and song lyrics up to 1998	\\"Songs\\" is available in both softcover and hardcover formats, with very different prices for each. If you want to spend a higher amount for a beautiful hardcover, here it is, or if you want to own the book for more of the content and to save money, there is a softcover version. I own the hardcover and am enjoying it very much. The paper is thick and glossy. This is a very hefty tome. The hardcover with its' large format pages does make for a great coffee table book.<br />As a preface to each album's lyrics, Bruce provides a short essay about what was going on with his life and what his idea for the message of the album was. There are great photographs throughout. Sometimes there are color photocopies of his handwritten lyrics, taken from the spiral notebooks that are his \\"blank slates\\". I really enjoyed reading the songs whose original lyrics were different, and the places where he inserted 2 or 3 different adjectives as he tried to find the best one for what he was trying to convey. I especially enjoyed \\"Candy's Room\\" as it is one of my favorite songs, and I was surprised to see that the original lyrics were quite a bit different and I got a gist for the original intent of the meaning of the song vs. my own interpretation of the final product, which were two different things.<br />Artistically, the book could use some improvement; after all, this is a coffee table book! The font is very plain for the lyrics of the songs, and the same font is used for every song, and every page of lyrics has a plain white background. I assumed since this is a coffee table book that the text would have been stylized a bit, perhaps with different fonts for each album or for every song, to match the mood of the song or such. For example, the printed lyrics in \\"The Rising\\" CD special edition package are printed with a very funky font (which are actually a bit hard to read when printed with such tiny font). Where in the CD case I am fine with clearly printed, plain style tiny font, I thought this large format book would have used the space and artistic flair to stylize it up a bit, as was done with \\"The Rising\\" lyrics inside the CD package. Another way the book could have been stylized more is to have the background of the song lyrics not plain white but at least a color or having a textured look, a border or a collage of sorts, with small photographs around it or something to jazz up the look of the pages. However, with it the way it is, with plain font on white paper, it allows for clear reading and forces the words to stand on their own and for what they are. Without clutter, we are easily able to use our imagination and form our own opinions. Perhaps that is what Bruce Springsteen wanted for us: to have his lyrics speak for themselves, to not overload our eyes and mind with images, to have a clear canvas and allow our own minds to use the words to form our own thoughts and images.<br />Despite my desire for it to be more artsy, I love the book and am treasuring it. This is about letting the songs speak for themselves. If you are looking for a biography of Springsteen, this is not it; there are other books already out there that fill this market. I hope at some time in the future a second book will be published with all of the songs that this book lacks, such as the recordings on the \\"Tracks\\" album that are not featured here and all of the recordings released since this book was published in 1998.<br />I agree with other reviewers here, I also crave more detail directly from Bruce Springsteen about his own reflections on his life, his songs, and his general outlook on things. We have plenty of information from other writers (i.e. Dave Marsh) but we are critical enough to know that we can't fully trust biographers, rock critics, and other spin-doctors. We want the information right from Bruce, not filtered through interviewers for television programs, and not through biographies. We know Bruce is a real person with strong convictions and firm opinions and we crave the information (the pure truth) directly from The Boss. However, I can appreciate that at some point, Bruce Springsteen and other musicians (and celebrities) who have reached a high popularity status level want to keep at least some of their lives and thoughts private. But I will ask anyway: \\"please...can we have more directly from you, Bruce\\"?inions and we crave the information (the pure truth) directly from The Boss.

Chapters are: Activities for listening and talking, for physical development, creative activities, and for learning from the world around them. Within each chapter, the activities are inside of a box approximately 5\\" x 7\\" in size. The information contains the activities goal and objective, whether it is indoors or outdoors (or both), how long the activity lasts in length of time, and how many children can do it at the same time. The activity is explained very clearly and even includes the suggested wording the authors feel the teacher should use to explain how to do the activity. Each material necessary to do the activity is underlined so you can quickly scan the activity to see what you need to have ready (i.e. cardboard box, string, etc.).<br />In addition to the 471 activities, the book contains useful information about basics such as setting up learning centers, using the block center, and recipes for different clays to use for modeling. There are also over 50 pages of basic information about setting up a preschool, how to make schedules, how to plan activities, and other information such as helping the child say goodbye to their parents and safety issues.<br />All in all this is a well-written and clear guidebook for preschool administrators and preschool teachers. Given the large amount of information, the price seems quite low. I think this book encompasses lots of information that other books duplicate-in other words, this book contains a lot and if you start off with this book, there will be little need for buying supplemental books that contain crafts and activities. Buy this one first and then supplement, as you feel necessary.<br />Throughout the book, the authors have included information as to what is developmentally appropriate for the four-year-old child. Every activity has information about why and what the activity serves to accomplish (learning objectives).<br />This book has simplified things and the writing is so clear that I can't think of a way to improve on the writing style of this book!<br />If you are a parent and are wondering if this is a good book for activities with your child, I would recommend against this book. This book is so very detailed for a school environment and much of it doesn't apply to the home. Many of the activities are for multiple children of the same developmental stage. There are many other activity books on the market, which more directly apply to use in the home.information as to what is developmentally appropriate for the four-year-old child.

Samalin's latest book is a fast, easy read specifically about how to discipline children aged one through the teenage years. Samalin gives so many examples of the typical way children are and then good and bad examples of the various ways parents can/should react, with the consequences of doing things a certain way. The examples of \\"issues\\" were surprising to me because our family has experienced so many of these and I didn't realize that the scenarios were so commonplace!  Samalin discusses communication methods, setting limits, making rules, and the like.<br />Samalin divides parenting styles into three categories: 1) permissive (bad); 2) too strict (bad) and 3) \\"simply authoritative\\" which she recommends. What Samalin describes \\"simply authoritarian\\" is very appealing to me, and is much of what I already practice, although I have disagreed with and disliked previous authors' descriptions of the term \\"authoritarian\\" and never considered myself \\"authoritarian\\". I say this to let you know that if presently you bristle at the idea of being an authoritarian parent, be open to the possibility that how she defines it may be different than your present definition. This book is full of great advice and recommendations!<br />Regarding parental emotions, Samalin acknowledges that it is all right to feel some negative emotions but is quick to point out that as the adults we are responsible for not choosing to act in bad ways out of anger. For example, to calm ourselves down before saying something that is negative (such as name calling or using a demeaning tone of voice) or lashing out in physical ways such as spanking or inflicting any other act that causes physical pain. As mature adults it is our responsibility to use good judgment when deciding how to react to some problem. She recommends we become aware of our negative emotions and acknowledge their presence but not let them rule our choices and our behavior. For more detail on this subject, see Somali's earlier book \\"Love and Anger: The Parental Dilemma\\".<br />I feel that parents who live the lifestyle that Samalin labels as \\"too permissive\\" will strongly dislike this book. Also parents whose goal is to be their child's best friend, or those who hesitate to set limits or those who waffle on their rules or consequences will dislike this book. The reason is that Samalin explains why those actions actually cause undesirable behavior in children; they cause the very behavior that parents wish would not exist!<br />This book is friendly toward mothers employed outside the home and there are sections about reducing motherhood guilt due to separation. This book does not in any way get into the debate of whether a mother should be at home with her children or go to work.<br />In case you are wondering about Somali's stance of punishment methods, she is against spanking and spends a good number of pages discouraging it (tip 49). She never once mentions the use of the ever-popular \\"time-outs\\" so, sadly, we miss her opinion on this entirely. Samalin recommends using consequences-warning of their impending use and if the offense occurs, to follow through on it and administer an appropriate consequence such as loss of playing with a certain toy, etc.<br />Samalin endorses prevention of parental burnout as essential to good parenting and I agree wholeheartedly. She gives only one remedy, however, separation. I was disappointed that other options are not discussed at all for the parents of children who are not yet ready to separate. Samalin encourages finding and using a good babysitter and then separating.  Unfortunately here again is an area where I feel Samalin misses the mark by not stating that the developmental stage of the child and the child's unique personality and temperament should be taken into consideration before separations, especially for weekends or a longer vacation, are made. I personally feel that first and foremost whether the child can handle the separation should be the deciding factor. For a great book about motherhood stress and burnout see Dr. Kendall-Tackett's book \\"The Hidden Feelings of Motherhood\\".<br />All in all I found this book helpful and interesting despite some advice that I disagreed with, however I realize that no one book will be an exact copy of my own opinions unless I am the author!  I honestly feel that to cram parenting advice for the broad range of ages one through teenage years is a daunting if not impossible task. I encourage parents of toddlers to read \\"The Discipline Book\\" by William Sears M.D.-I found this most helpful for the first year and the toddler years (although the author says it is for birth through age 10). This book by Dr. Sears really stresses the developmental stages of babies and young children and what we are to expect from certain ages and then how best to avoid problems.  With that said, I do love Samalin's book for use from age 3 and up.e deciding factor.

Both Dr. and Mrs. Moore have careers in the education field and so are well aware of what goes on in primary and secondary education in America. They don't spent time bashing the schools in this book but instead promote homeschooling as a superior education.<br /><br />My short summary:<br />This book encourages children to be at home with a stay-at-home mother from infancy through school-age (avoiding preschool). Then they recommend not teaching reading until the child is ready, and that can fall between 8 and 12. They discourage forcing learning to read before age 8 citing that it may cause eye problems to occur. Formal lessons in other subjects are to begin no sooner than age 8. There is no one right curriculum or method that they espouse. The most important lessons in the early years are character formation and to form a close knit family bond. They feel strongly that homeschooling parents should not run their `home school' just like a government (public) school. And lastly, they feel it is essential to have the child do volunteer work and be of service to others on a daily or weekly basis starting at a very young age. This they call \\"The Moore Formula\\" for success. Be forewarned: anyone who doesn't agree with these ideas will dislike portions of the book or the entire book.<br /><br />My longer summary:<br />First off the book jacket states the book will help you pick a curriculum. Whether that is something you want or something that turns you off please know that I could not find that information anywhere in the book and I did read it cover to cover.<br /><br />The book starts of with the most convincing argument I have found anywhere (including in general parenting books) as to the value of young children staying home with their mothers rather than attending preschool. In \\"Miseducation: Preschoolers At Risk\\", author David Elkind speaks to the problems that can occur when children go to preschool instead of staying at home with a parent. Elkind doesn't focus hugely on the value of an intact and close knit family. In contrast, the Moore's book does cover the value of a close-knit family in extensive detail.<br /><br />Character formation, instilling values, ethics and good social skills are the main goal of raising young children, according to the Moore Formula. This can only be accomplished when the children have a close relationship with their parents and when they are physically with their parents so the parent can guide them. Separation at young ages (i.e. going to daycare or preschool) prevents the parent from seeing the bad or inappropriate behavior and therefore not being able to correct it. (I take it a step farther by saying tha this separation can actually cause problems that then need to be fixed.)<br /><br />The authors have spent years researching child physiological development, cognitive development, and reading readiness. The Moore's feel that children should not be taught to read before the age of 8 as a minimum and possibly until 12. If you want even more detailed information on this topic, read their book \\"Better Late than Early\\". They state that if  reading instruction begins too early, whether at home or at school, if they have difficulty they are labeled learning disabled whereas if they waited until later to learn to read that would not happen. Additionally they feel other problems may crop up due to the learning disability label, such as self-esteem issues, acting out with bad behavior, et cetera. How you feel about this opinion on reading will heavily influence how you like the book. If you are looking for proof that waiting a bit to teach reading is okay then you will like this book and also \\"Better Late than Early\\". If you have strong opinions against this idea then you will not like that portion of the book!<br /><br />In lieu of formalized lessons and reading instruction before age 8 or so, the Moore'srecommend character formation as the main goal of home educating your child. Television viewing is to be kept to a minimum of quality programming if not banned entirely. Reading aloud to young non-readers is strongly encouraged. Being of service by volunteering is recommended on a weekly basis from a very young age. Parents should also model being of service to others by doing volunteer work themselves (the family should do the volunteer work together).<br /><br />The bottom line is that if we as parents spend time raising children with good personalities and social skills they will be fun to be around and well liked by others. By delaying reading and formal teaching until at least age 8, a lot of stress is avoided.<br /><br />The Moore's are Christian and I am guessing there are about 10 religious references overall made by the authors; that is not much compared to some of the Christian homeschooling books on the market. Their faith is not noted on the book jacket. I mention this as some people seek out books written by Christian homeschoolers, and some may want a heavier hand with Christian content while other people prefer secular homeschooling books.<br /><br />There are also 17 essays written by homeschooling families using the Moore method and some of those are more laden with religious references  than the Moore's own writings, such as saying that the Lord called them to homeschool or that they feel homeschooling is a responsibility as outlined in the Bible. I have read other books where religious references outweighed the content, such as saying \\"to get the best curriculum for your child pray to the Lord and he will guide you\\". This book does not do that. The book is loaded with ideas, opinions, and references to studies, which provide information-rich content. (I am trying to explain what this book is like so that potential readers can judge for themselves if this book is right for them.)<br /><br />The most confusing thing to me was that throughout the book they reference using \\"the Moore formula\\" to have a stress-free home school but they don't say exactly what \\"The Moore Formula\\" is until the last chapter which is only five pages long. This short chapter really belongs at the beginning. I advise reading this chapter first and then as they go on to explain their formula in detail throughout the book you will understand the references they continually make to \\"The Moore Formula\\".<br /><br />Update March 2008: This was the first book I ever read about homeschooling when my oldest was just a toddler. This review was written and published here when that child was just two years old. Right now my oldest is ten years old and in fifth grade (and is homeschooled). This book was a big influence to me, it was inspiring. Since then, I went on to read many other homeschooling books, magazines, and listened to lectures at homeschooling conferences (from both secular and Christian sources). I have two children. My kids have never been to daycare or preschool or school. Thinking back on the book now I can say that it was very inspiring and left me feeling empowered and that \\"homeschooling is good and it can be done with success\\".

Both the writing and the illustrations are superior. This is one of those books that is definitely worth owning, and in a hardcover version, not a paperback that will wear and tear. Parents: it is a keeper, one that you will save for years and to read to your future grandchildren.<br />The story is of a boy's journey on a mysterious train, the Polar Express, that takes children (adorned in their pajamas) to the North Pole to Santa's village. I won't spoil the story by telling any more...<br />There are loads of Christmas themed children's books out there for this age range. Many are mediocre or just plain garbage. This book is in the superior category and a \\"must own\\".<br />Knowing nothing about this story, both my son and I were drawn to it because of his love of trains. If you don't know the story, just be aware it introduces the idea that not all people believe in Santa Claus. This was the first time my (then) three-year-old learned that not everyone believes, whether they are adults or children. It also explains that as some people grow older they change from a believer to a non-believer. Just know that before reading the story to your child. For us it introduced the idea of non-believing. Another family I know read the book after an older child told this young child there is no Santa Claus, and the book helped deal with the issue of when some believe and some don't believe.<br />The gift pack we purchased had the audio version on CD. Narrator-actor William Hurt's voice is wonderful, slow and flowing...just right to evoke the mood of the story! There is also a CD-ROM for the computer (sold separately), which is a read-aloud story with images that my children watch a handful of times per Christmas season.<br />The gift pack also comes with a Christmas tree ornament. My children are thrilled to have a Polar Express related ornament to adorn our Christmas tree because they love trains and they love this story.	2002-11-20

It was simply wonderful. They had not heard the book read aloud to them yet and they loved the story.<br />The best part of this recording is that the author is the narrator. There is something special that happens when we are privileged to hear an author read his own work. There are slight nuances we may miss when reading the book to ourselves or aloud, the tone of the voice, the slightly different voices for each character and so on. E.B. White's Maine accent is wonderful to listen to.<br />There are plenty of book summaries and reviews that discuss the content of the story so I won't repeat that. Suffice it to say this is a wonderful story about friendship, loneliness, empathy and teamwork. The mourning of a natural death of a friend is counterbalanced with the joy of birth and making new friendships.<br />Do yourself and your children a favor and listen to this audio recording. It is wonderful for long trips in the car, for listening to before bed, or while working on an art project or with Lego's.<br />A pure delight!	2002-11-19

I have not yet read the book by the same title written by Diana Waring. Waring has great speaking abilities. The tape is of good quality and the recording is clear. I don't hear an audience so I am wondering if this was spoken to a mock audience. (Other tapes I own are sometimes frustrating due to background noise from conference attendees.)<br />Waring is Christian and there are numerous references to religion in her lecture. There are references to \\"God calling\\" her to homeschool and advising us to pray to the Lord for help with whatever homeschooling dilemma we have such as choosing a curriculum that is right for us. Waring doesn't give tips about using certain curriculum, she asks us to seek the counsel of the Lord. There is no mention in the product description to indicate to us that this contains religious content, so I mention it here for those who would like to know.<br />The subjects covered are: why she began homeschooling, about starting off as running a school in her home and that it failed miserably-following a \\"school in a box\\" type of expensive curriculum. She discusses that learning can take place anywhere and everywhere. She said that reading Susan MacCauley's book \\"For the Children's Sake\\" helped her redefine what \\"an education\\" is but does not elaborate on that topic. (I know this book discusses the Charlotte Mason method of homeschooling and this book has a Christian slant.)  She discusses the importance of parents and children cultivating a strong relationship with each other, first and foremost as a goal to strive for.<br />Waring goes on to discuss briefly, the Meyers-Briggs personality/learning styles and gives great examples of how these four different personalities approach learning and living. She explains how we should all familiarize ourselves with which style we as homeschooling parents are and which each of our children are. She gives examples of problems that can happen in the process of homeschooling when parent and child are not the same learning style. She then briefly discusses learning modalities: visual, auditory and kinesthetic and how those impact how we like to take in data and information. Once we know those things we can then figure out how to homeschool each child so they learn the most and everyone has the least amount of frustration.<br />Waring briefly discusses the need for humor in our lives and she has another audiocassette lecture that delves into that subject titled \\"The Hilarious Homeschool Workshop\\". It is about how to have humor in our homes without resorting to hurtful tactics such as teasing and using put-downs to make a joke. In that tape she gives an argument that the Bible and the Lord want people to lead humorous lives, that it is not anti-Christian to have a laughter filled home.ooling when parent and child are not the same learning style.

There are 7 2-page spreads, which consist of background for placing the stickers. Each spread has a few sentences to tell a story or guide the sticker placement. The information/text about dinosaurs is very basic and rudimentary. Most pages have one sentence. There is no distinction or discussion of there being three different periods in time (Cretaceous, etc.) and all the dinosaurs are combined and mixed together. One page features flying reptiles and is correct in not identifying them as dinosaurs. Another page has underwater prehistoric creatures and is correct in saying they are not dinosaurs. Kudos for the accuracy there.<br />The backgrounds are creative and well done. There are backgrounds of swamps, forest, desert, sky, and underwater. Stickers depict flying reptiles, dinosaurs and underwater prehistoric creatures.<br />The stickers are billed as \\"reusable\\". The stickers stick very well the first time around. A bonus \\"pro\\" is since they are \\"reusable\\" stickers, if they are accidentally stuck onto floors, walls, or furniture they remove easily and effortlessly. The \\"con\\" is that (after using 5 different books in this series and having this consistent in every book) I must say that once a sticker is peeled and placed in a different spot, it does not lie flat.

US	51212167	RAQ8RBPPC5MUH	0684872722	725163780	The Educated Child: A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade	Books	2	55	88	N	N	In the end they admit the parents efforts are futile	I found this book frustrating. I read it cover to cover and found this depressing rather than empowering.  If you are not aware of the problems of public schools then this is a good book to read to learn of the issues. I wish all parents who utilize the public school system were concerned enough about their children's education to read a book about the subject.<br />This book is intended to fill parents in on what the authors think kids today should be learning in public school. Then there is a comparison and complaint as to what is really going on. There is not much in the current state of the American public education system these authors like.  Poor SAT scores and other standardized tests are cited as proof of a failing system. There is no negative discussion of the pitfalls and problems with standardized tests despite there being lots of information on this subject in other places-standardized tests are held in high esteem by these authors as proof that learning has taken place.<br />This book fully outlines all the things the authors feel are problems in the schools, from what they call \\"bad teachers\\" to what make up \\"bad schools\\" and their opinions about bad methods of teaching and curriculum. The author's conservative views and anti-multiculturalism views are very clear. The authors want to go back to basics and feel that rote memorization and drill are not only vital to a good education but character building. One thing that I am still wondering after reading this book is, back in \\"the good old days\\" of learning the basics by rote memorization and drill, do we have any statistics such as test scores or graduation rates to prove those methods actually work? I believe the answer is that standardized tests were not being done `back then' and that we know graduation rates from high school were very low although that is never discussed in this book. They don't compare apples to apples here in that regard. They are quick to cite research where it fits their agenda, such as trying to prove \\"the new math\\" has resulted in lower math standardized test scores. They never translate for us parents what \\"the new math\\" is or when it came into existence. They reference bad curriculum such as `discovery' methods of teaching math and science but don't get into enough detail so we can form our own opinions. This is very much about the author's opinions and directly trying to impose their views on the parent. It is not about offering options or remaining neutral with regard to opinion and letting the reader come to their own conclusions.<br />The authors prod and prod the parents to monitor what is going on in the schools, to go to the classrooms to see what is going on. They urge parents to \\"get involved\\".  They say parents should investigate teachers and make sure their child gets in the classroom of the \\"good teachers\\". When they are done saying parents should harangue the administrators, later contradict themselves and say to not prod the administrators too much to change classes, etc. and to not cause the administrators too much trouble. They also acknowledge that if all the kids were with the \\"good\\" teachers no one would be with the \\"bad\\" teachers. How about that for depressing? Also they take teachers out of some of the blame game when they say that poor discipline due to lack of good parenting is the cause of some of the problems in school. As you may have guessed this book does a lot of finger pointing and plays the blame game.<br />Something else the authors seem to neglect mentioning is that what goes on in one class vs. another class in same grade of same school can be very different. Right now I know of classes where one teacher is using drill and another is using puppets and songs to teach the letters of the alphabet, both Kindergarten classes in the same school. How can we label what is a \\"bad school\\" when there is so much inconsistency? Furthermore, they like to label \\"bad school\\"---tell me this, if the grade is \\"bad\\" in reading but \\"good\\" in math, does that make a good school or a bad school? If one grade is \\"good\\" but another \\"bad\\" how do we label that school?<br />The authors give a skimming of what should be covered in each grade. This is not original material, it is acknowledged as being from the books of E.D. Hirsh, the core curriculum books \\"What Your X Grader Should Know\\". They say over and over to go to those references for more detailed and complete outlines of what each child should learn in each grade. Then what bothers me is they say there is a 3-year leeway there, that what is recommended for 3rd grade may be covered in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. How is a parent to keep up with every grade that Hirsh recommends with this 3-year leeway? I also have a personal problem of so much labeling of opinion of what every person should know. There is no room left for the child to spend more time in their own studies. For example they feel all 1st grades should know Aesop's Fables but what about if the child is a dinosaur buff and is read adult level books on dinosaurs? The authors complain of a lack of teaching history in chronological order and ask the parents to somehow add in this curriculum at home. Seems like overkill to me, to do an entire chronological history at home plus do different segments of history and social studies at school.<br />And if the school is a \\"bad school\\" they say to either use their \\"free choice\\" to change schools. There is no voucher system in America! There is no free choice to select the public school of choice! They recommend private schools but caution that not all of them are good plus they seem not to realize that many people can't afford private schools. They suggest moving as an option to get into a different public school.reading but \\"good\\" in math, does that make a good school or a bad school?

They are attached into the stapled booklet but you can cut them out if desired. I am choosing to keep mine attached for now and can use the stencils right in the book. It also comes with 8 pieces of brightly pattered paper to use to make the chains. The chains made with that paper make a chain 4 animals-long. I look forward to making longer chains with paper that I supply.<br />My kids are having fun making these with me. For kids to make these by themselves they need to be able to trace a stencil on their own and cut with scissors following a curving line. Also remember that to make long chains requires many layers of paper and the thicker the paper the harder it is to cut. Since my kids can't yet do these on their own we make them together with them directing the stencil and paper used and with me doing the tracing and the cutting.<br />The animals are: giraffe, elephant, flamingo, monkey, zebra, lion, kangaroo, snake, raccoon, camel, polar bear and penguin.<br />There are other books in this series with different stencils. I wish the dinosaur book was back in print.	2002-10-27
US	51212167	RP4M2FCS8DR6H	0070579334	709707198	One Small Square: Woods	Books	5	30	30	N	N	Amazing amount of info and inspiration & [good] price!	What a gem! I was surprised when I discovered this book. The gist of the book is for the child (or adult) to mark off a square space in the woods and begin exploring and learning. This book is a real integration of activities, suggested observations, and fact. The learner is to explore, dig, look, observe and investigate every inch of this square area. While suggesting the learner look for this or that, the author provides factual information about various findings. The book goes into a lot of detail and there are many things that the author thinks may be found. I bet that the learner won't find everything that is mentioned but that is OK, at least the reader can experience it in reading about it in the book if it is missed \\"in real life\\".<br />The book starts off in autumn, assuming the learner begins in the fall and in an area of deciduous trees. A small sampling of what is addressed in this book is why trees lose their leaves, how trees store energy and make energy, examples of camouflage with animals, migration of birds and butterflies, insects, spiders and their webs, lizards and mammals big and small. As the book progresses winter then spring then summer is discussed.<br />The illustrations are drawn and in color (just like the cover), these are not photographs. There are loads of details in the drawings. At the back is an illustrated guide to creatures grouped by their classification (leaves, mammals, fungi) and an index.<br />The learner is encouraged to do creative projects such as leaf and trunk rubbings. Also keeping a nature journal or notebook to record the findings is recommended.<br />I am surprised that so much information and creative ideas packed into this small and very inexpensive book. This is one in a series of \\"one small square\\" books and I plan to buy more to use in our homeschooling adventure. Now this is science!	2002-10-26

Each spread has a few sentences to tell a story or act as a guide for the sticker placement, which includes directions that include numbers. This is really about counting, that is all the math involved. For example, it asks to find 5 more pirates to place on the page. That is the sum total of the type of math this book contains, in case you were wondering since this is labeled a math activity book. The backgrounds are creative and well done. There are backgrounds of pirate ships in the water, on the deck, inside the captain's quarters, in the galley, and on an island digging up treasure. Stickers depict children, fish and sea serpents, pirates, parrots, digging tools, treasure chests, flags and food and dinnerware.<br />Of special note, there is not one single illustration of knives or guns. There are no scenes of violence. This is a pure and innocent pirate book, where the pirates are actually cavorting with children and having fun.<br />The stickers are billed as \\"reusable\\". The stickers stick very well the first time around. A bonus \\"pro\\" is since they are \\"reusable\\" stickers, if they are accidentally stuck onto floors, walls, or furniture they remove easily and effortlessly. The \\"con\\" is that (after using 5 different books in this series and having this consistent in every book) I must say that once a sticker is peeled and placed in a different spot, it does not lie flat.

US	51212167	R21Z2V9BL4CDWQ	0439249902	263202844	Long Train: 101 Cars On The Track	Books	1	19	22	N	N	worst children's train book I've purchased	This is my least favorite train book for children. When I ordered it online I thought it would be a fun book with many lift-the-flaps and I hoped it would help teach counting to 101 to my children. What a disappointment.<br />This is the first lift-the-flap book that I've seen that has two storylines. There is one storyline that is in between the flaps and is not related to the flaps in any way, and a totally different story going on under the flaps. The two cannot be read together at all. To make sense one must first read the story on the pages, ignoring the flaps. Then go back and lift each flap and read the words inside the flap and go through all 101 cars to read that story. The text under the flaps is much, much longer and more detailed than the other \\"story\\". There actually is no real plot to the words on the pages, it is mostly train sounds and disjointed phrases such as \\"can't go back\\".<br />I don't feel this teaches counting, as there are not a certain number of objects matched to the number, for example there are not 8 of some object than the number 8. The outer flap has a number on it then the text inside doesn't relate to that number, for example the flap number 30 says, \\"got Persian rugs\\". Every inner flap says \\"got\\" and then something. The flaps are so small they don't allow for showing the number of objects represented by the number nor does the text even say \\"got 30 Persian rugs\\" (which would have made sense to me).  There are many varied and unrelated objects under the flaps, the text rhymes--sometimes. An example of a good rhyme (albeit goofy and probably not understood by young children) is \\"got CD, DVD, and movies, got party jackets for the smoothies, got 70s wigs for the groovies\\" (under 3 flaps). An example of a bad rhyme is \\" got cables that stretch for miles and miles, got telephones, faxes, and little mobiles\\". The only thing that is truly counted is if you count each train in the book, which would be a different exercise than reading the story on the page, or the story under the flaps and it is unrelated to lifting the flaps.<br />If this review sounds confusing, I apologize but this is the strangest and least organized book I've ever seen written for children. It seems to make no sense and is very jumbled up and a mess and hard to explain. I plan to get rid of this book as I dread it when my children ask to read it, and to inspire a love of reading in them I feel I should be a happy and enthusiastic reader, and I feel the books should be only good or exceptional in quality, and this is neither.ory on the page, or the story under the flaps and it is unrelated to lifting the flaps.<br />If this review sounds confusing, I apologize but this is the strangest and least organized book I've ever seen written for children.

US	51212167	R2BUOONINCIQAP	0802774520	463582037	Steam Train Ride	Books	5	0	0	N	N	great photos, good amount of detail	High quality photographs accompany a story of a young boy (looks 3 years old) who goes on steam train ride alone. The journey goes from buying the ticket to disembarking. Each step of the journey is documented in the numerous photos and explained in detailed text. The boy is treated to more than just the ride; he converses with train employees who explain in detail information such as how the steam engine works, the names of the various train worker positions (fireman, etc.) and explains what their job is. Different train signs are shown and their meaning is explained. As the train ride begins the boy gazes out the window and gazes at the passing scenes of farms and Amish people. The photos are of the Strausberg, Pennsylvania steam train ride.<br />My only negative comment is I find it strange and unrealistic to have a 3 year-old all alone on this entire journey, from buying the ticket by himself, to the ride,  to disembarking. Where are the parents? I would have rather had them along on the trip as a family experience.<br />There is a good amount of detail about trains and their inner workings compared to other books published for this age range. I appreciated this as my two young train lovers are eager for information and real photos about trains vs. the many beautifully hand illustrated fictional works about trains that are already available in the picture books published for 4-8 year olds. There is a good amount of text here, about 4 sentences per page, and 32 pages.<br />This captivated my 2-year-old train lover (despite publishers age recommendations). ... I highly recommend this book for train lovers, but beginning at age 2 not 4 as the publisher recommends.<br />If your child yearns for more information, I suggest that you move up to non-fiction that the publishers deem for 8-11 years old or even to read aloud books published for adults. Use your child's interest level not a publisher's guideline. Even if you can't read every word in the book due to the child wanting to turn the page to see different pictures, just read what you can get to and what they want to hear. I recommend \\"Cross section train\\",  \\"Eyewitness:Train\\" and \\"Railways and Trains\\" published by Usbourne books for non-fiction with much detail, all are published for the 8-11 age range.ild wanting to turn the page to see different pictures, just read what you can get to and what they want to hear.

US	51212167	R1IIA9S7DR1EO7	0195218507	784826902	The Mystery of the Hieroglyphs: The Story of the Rosetta Stone and the Race to Decipher Egyptian Hieroglyphs	Books	5	11	12	N	N	loaded with details, brings history to life	This book tells of the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and about attempts to break the code of the hieroglyphs and demotic script. We learn of the various men who tried to break the code and about the successful young man who finally did break the code. The book also tells about who currently owns the Rosetta Stone and the journey and literal fighting that took place over its ownership.<br />Through this story the reader is introduced to what hieroglyphs are and what demotic script is. Battles are very lightly touched upon, enough to explain why the Egyptians began writing in Greek as well. (The Rosetta stone tells the same story in Hieroglyphs, Demotic script, and Greek and was the key to breaking the hieroglyphic code.) The reader is kept in suspense about the meaning and the decoding of the hieroglyphs...as the discoveries are made the code is revealed to us in bits and pieces. For example we start off not knowing if the symbols stand for sounds of a spoken word or for literal translations to objects/animals, etc. In the end the hieroglyphs are spelled out and the reader is given several examples to try to interpret their meaning. Some of the basic writing rules are clearly discussed such as that the writing can go left to right or right to left, and we are to follow the face of the animal shapes to tell us which way to go. Writing can be vertical and the symbols can be backwards or forwards! There are no punctuation marks, sentences or paragraphs, it all runs together.<br />There are photographs, illustrations, timelines, and maps throughout this book, which add to the experience. This is loaded with text, it is not as skimpy in text or detail as some books that publishers group into this same age category. Yet it is not as loaded or illustration-driven as the DK/Eyewitness books (as a comparison comment, not a complaint).<br />I especially enjoyed the details about the life of Jean Francios Champollion, the man who broke the code of the hieroglyphs. Taught to read at a young age and homeschooled by his older brother for most of his life, he was devoted to reading and learning foreign languages from an early age. He disliked math and science and chose instead to study languages. His devotion to his passion lead to his decoding the Rosetta Stone and later to fundraising to pay for an expedition to Egypt. He was so passionate about the bringing history of Egypt to others that he persuaded the King of France to acquire many Egyptian artifacts and he became the curator of the Egyptian museum of the Louvre, which still is on display today. This is all told in an interesting way in this book. We can all learn something from Champollion, to follow our interests, teach our children what they are most interested in, and to excel in one area (of study) can lead to great things if the passion is allowed to flourish.

I don't think children need to be directed to think about something, it happens to each of us as we read. Perhaps we don't all wonder about the same thing at the same paragraph in a book but that is OK. Sometimes the questions asked the child to interpret something but then the true answer is never revealed which is annoying and I feel leaves the reader feeling incompetent and possibly frustrated to have a curiosity sparked but left without the correct answer, wondering if they are correct or not.<br />This is a great book to tell the story of unlocking the mystery of the Rosetta Stone and an easily understood introduction to hieroglyphics (and the two other languages) used by the Egyptians. This book really brings history to life.read at a young age and homeschooled by his older brother for most of his life, he was devoted to reading and learning foreign languages from an early age. He disliked math and science and chose instead to study languages. His devotion to his passion lead to his decoding the Rosetta Stone and later to fundraising to pay for an expedition to Egypt. He was so passionate about the bringing history of Egypt to others that he persuaded the King of France to acquire many Egyptian artifacts and he became the curator of the Egyptian museum of the Louvre, which still is on display today.

It is very sturdy and each 2-page spread depicts at least 2 train cars. Because this is a Lionel book, the illustrations of the various cars are very accurate and more detailed than other train board books that are on the market (some of which are very cartoon-y and not true to life in appearance).<br />There are many different train cars in this book, each a different color and the text includes the color, hence the subtitle referencing this is a book to teach colors. (I feel that any book with objects of various colors can be discussed during a reading to teach colors, you don't need a special board book to teach colors. Just pick objects your child is interested in and simply mention the colors and they will pick it up easily. My children happen to love trains so the fact that this book obviously was intended to write colors is a coincidence for our family.)<br />The different trains depicted are caboose, hopper car, log car, auto car, tank car, boxcar, crane train, flatcar, and steam locomotive and tender. There is a lot going on in the illustrations including children and adults doing various things near the train, a farm wit cows, and a night road construction scene. There is much to talk about to go beyond the simple and short text. The text rhymes and is catchy. This is a cute book and is not annoying as some board books are. There are ten pages (I wish there were more)!<br />Note that this is one in a series of train books published by \\"Little Lionel\\". I suggest that all young train fans buy the entire series!	2002-10-17

I chose the first book in the series because my recently-turned 5 year-old son is immersed in dinosaurs right now. It was a hit and took us through long car trip rides, (I was reading aloud as a passenger in the car).<br />Both my 5 year old and my 2 year old enjoyed this book so much that I had to read it twice in a row and each time it is read aloud the request is to repeat it at least one more time. I think this is a good starter for the chapter book genre because the chapters are short and there are some good illustrations peppered throughout. Each reading takes about 20 minutes.<br />There is some adventure and suspense in the story when the children come face to face with various dinosaurs and each time they feel they are in danger. There is a bit of suspense but nothing huge, whether your child gets scared is something I can't predict...it really depends on the child. Sometimes they dinosaurs end up being pleasant plant eaters but the Tyrannosaurus is a real threat but the children escape him and make it to safety.<br />My kids found this an exciting suspenseful story and when I told my older son there are more books featuring the brother and sister, he became very excited. The content of the book is fully understandable to a four year old and up, I think the rating from the publisher of this being for 8-12 year olds must be for an assumed self-reading level. (I think my 2 year old also \\"got it\\" but who knows? The fact that he sits through this reading is still amazing me.)  I can imagine that if children like this series that they would devour the entire series, which is presently up to number 27.<br />I rate it four stars, as it is not stellar literature; it is a good story that the children enjoy. It is a fast read and exciting though. Especially for children reading this to themselves, any good-natured story that hooks them in and gets them reading is good stuff to me!...reading is good stuff to me!...	2002-10-17

The storyline is about a streamlined steam locomotive, the Chesapeake and Ohio line, which is pulling coaches and tank cars filled with milk and chocolate syrup (!).  The trip is an overnight journey, which begins at night and ends the next morning. The passengers are looking out of the windows at the various sights and then they sleep on the train overnight. The text tells of the journey, over rails, over bridges, through tunnels, etc. The language in the text is highlighting opposite words such as above and below, up and down.<br />Because this is a Lionel book the illustrations of the train cars are detailed and accurate, much more so than other train board books on the market that are not published by Lionel.<br />Both of my children love this book and others in the series.

I found it useful for finding places to visit on a recent trip to the West Coast and to find places to visit near my home for day trips to find dinosaur-related exhibits. This book is a gem!<br />The book is divided by geographic regions. Each featured location has a descriptive paragraph about the exhibit/site/museum. Then lists give information about the specific features such as which articulated skeletons are on display, the hours, admission fees, address and even directions. Some maps are included to boot. This book was published in 1994.  Of course any travel book has the risk of being not current as soon as it goes to press so I found that the hours of operation and the fees were out of date. However, having the basic information is very helpful. Because eight years had past since the publishing date, I took sources from the book and double-checked in the information online at the websites of the museums for the most up to date information.<br />There is also a basic introduction to dinosaurs and a four page listing of Latin names with pronunciation guides and the English interpretation for each; both are helpful for beginners like our family.	2002-10-17

It is not about a train song in regular terms, it is about the sounds that the trains and train workers make as they go about their train business. Each passage contains sounds such as \\"All Aboard\\" and \\"ding, ding ding\\". The text is simple and rhyming. I love the passage \\"by now some are singing, babies giggle, grown-ups snooze-we're bouncing to the rhythm of the chugga-chugga-choos\\".<br />Because Lionel publishes these books the illustrations are realistic, much more realistic than other board books featuring trains that are not published by Lionel. The trains featured in this board book are the Super Chief diesel engine pulling silver coaches; some with dome tops and also a black steam locomotive with tender and brown coaches. The story line features passengers boarding and disembarking at a train station and looking at a traffic jam of cars and a car accident as the train goes by unhindered by the problems on the road.<br />Both my children enjoy this book as they are real rail fans. If you enjoy this book please note it is one of a series of \\"Little Lionel\\" board books.	2002-10-17

The books are titled \\"I Can\\", \\"I See\\", \\"I Hear\\" and \\"I Touch\\". Each of these books is tiny in page size and each has 8 pages. Note that these books are each published separately as regular-sized board books and I believe that those contain more pages per book.<br />The tiny books come in a little box. Both the books and the box fit perfectly into the hands of a one and two year old toddler which I feel is the best feature of this product. So many good books are just too bulky or large for a toddler to really tote around easily.  I love this little set as I feel it is a good thing when a toddler really enjoys books and the tiny size allows them to be held easily and comfortably. I did not discard the little box as my two-year old loves taking them out of the box and putting them back into the box as an activity in and of itself. He loves browsing them himself and of course having them read aloud. This little set entertained my son through a 5 plus hour plane ride and then a 2 hour car ride after that.<br />These are not stories; each 2-page spread contains one word and two illustrations for that word. The illustrations depict what looks like the Caillou character at a toddler age, although the boy and baby in the book remain nameless. Both my 2 year old and my 5 year old think this character is a toddler aged Caillou (although there is a different illustrator for the Caillou books). If you are not familiar with Caillou, he is a 4-year-old boy who is the main character in a PBS show and there are also Caillou books on the market. Since my 2 year old enjoys the Caillou show, he calls this character \\"baby Caillou\\". He loves these books and at the moment they are rarely out of his little hands.	2002-10-16

This book is the transcript of an event put together by John Taylor Gatto, featuring various educators as speakers, discussing successful alternatives to government (public) schools. The event was called \\"The Exhausted School\\" and took place in Carnegie Hall on 11/13/91. In addition to the transcript of the talk there is an introduction by Patrick Ferenga, organizational notes before the event, program notes (biographies of the speakers) and a special introduction and afterward by John Taylor Gatto.<br />The various educators present a brief speech on what their educational method is and why it is successful. Some former students of Gatto also spoke briefly about how little public schools contributed to their successful lives, and how almost all of what they consider important learning happened outside of school on a self-initiated basis.  John Taylor Gatto is the only person whose words are speaking out about what is wrong with the present American government schools and why change is needed. For more detailed opinions of Gatto, read \\"A Different Kind of Teacher\\" or \\"Dumbing Us Down\\".<br />The purpose of this talk was to get the word out to educators and parents that there are alternatives to the public schools that are successful. I believe the goal was to get parents and teachers motivated to inspire reform of the public schools or at least to know there are working models that reform can be based on. If reform doesn't come fast enough (or ever) then know there are options out there for educational alternatives for our children. Parents who want options can either use the existing alternative schools or perhaps take on the endeavor to open a new school or to homeschool.<br />The educators briefly discuss what their schools are like and a scant overview of the educational philosophy behind their schools. This is great information for someone who is not yet familiar with these educational options-a good first start in hearing about these schools. If you are interested in more detailed information there is more on the Internet or in other books about those schools. Homeschooling is one option that is discussed by Patrick Farenga.  The schools represented are: Sudbury Valley School (a democratic school), Hawthorne Valley Farm School (a Waldorf school), Alternative Community School of Ithaca (public school of choice), and the Albany Free School.<br />Gatto wraps up the book with an afterward that is a concise history of how American public schools grew to be what they are today. For a long expansion of this short afterward read \\"The Underground History of American Education\\".<br />This is a fast and short read that will be of interest to those interested in learning about educational alternatives to public school or those interested in reading about public school reform. As usual, Gatto does not mince words and gets right to the point.

This is a great rhyming story about a boy's imaginative train play. A young boy has set up a creative train layout in his room: going over the fish tank (bridge), to the freight yard, up mountains, down valleys, etc. His entire room is laid out with track and many of his toys are involved in the layout such as blocks to prop up the track and dolls to lift boxes. As we read the book we see the toys \\"moving\\" and doing jobs and the illustrations are such that we are as small as the train and looking out and around as if we were riding the train ourselves. At the end the train is said to go into the roundhouse and the boy is seen sleeping in bed with his locomotive and the track laid out on the floor all around his room! Great imagination!<br />The text itself is well written and rhyming and just has a great flow to it.<br />I bought our first hardcover edition right after it was published which was over 3 years ago. My older son has loved this since he was 2 years old and I have read it over and over and over. He is a real train lover and even now at age 5 he loves this book (over many of the other train-themed children's fiction books we own).<br />The text is not annoying in any way and I truly don't groan when I have to reread it to him several times. My second son has loved this book since infancy. Sadly, after 3 years of handling it finally fell apart and now I am buying a second hardcover edition. I browsed the board book version in a store but was disappointed. The hardcover is a larger size than usual and the illustrations are bold and large. In the board book version some of the illustrations are greatly pared down in size and much is lost. If you own the board version I highly recommend also buying the hardcover edition if your child likes the book. This would make a great gift!	2002-10-03

The poems are great; their content is funny and rhythmic. Through the poems we learn about the various insects. Some have very creative text formatting such as the inchworm; the text is shaped like a humped-up inchworm. The illustrations are very creative collages that are unique compared to most other children's books.<br />I began reading this when my first son was 2 years old and he loved the poems then and he loves them now. Neither of my children are otherwise very interested in reading about insects but this book captures their interest and they laugh hysterically at some of these poems. After reading these they have found some of the more unusual insects such as the walking stick outdoors and called it to my attention. We've owned the book for 3 years, every once in a while my now-5 year old will find it and get excitedly proclaim \\"we haven't read this in a long time\\" and begs me to read it again (and again and again).<br />Some of the insects featured are the inchworm, tick, walking stick, praying mantis, monarch butterfly, daddy long legs spider and army ants.<br />The poems are so much fun I don't mind reading the entire book two or three times in a row. A fun book to read to young children. This is good reading for just plain fun or to introduce poetry or to enhance learning about insects and nature.	2002-09-22
US	51212167	R1FEAUDIL2NTP3	0345442865	874694067	Playful Parenting: An Exciting New Approach to Raising Children That Will Help You Nurture Close Connections, Solve Behavior Problems, and Encourage Confidence	Books	5	356	363	N	Y	Great resource for parents kids aged 3 and up	The premise of the book is that children need a strong connection with their parents in order to have good self-esteem, self-confidence, happiness and good behavior. The author is a play therapist that feels that the key to getting and staying connected with our children aged three through the teen years is through play. If you think your child has great behavior then following the ideas in this book will still help foster close connections and reduce the minor issues such as whining, begging, etc. The author contends that simply by spending time playing with our children with the child in control of the nature of the play, that a strong connection can be made. Specific ideas for play \\"tactics\\" are given when the parent wants to solve some particular problem or fear. This book is not just for \\"problem kids\\" who have sought professional counseling with the author.<br />The gist of the book is that at about age 3 and up children are in the play mode, they like to play, want to play, need to play. They also at this time live in a world where they feel powerless or isolated at least some of the time, even in the best family situations. The theory is that they have \\"cups\\" that fill with love and sometimes when feeling isolated or powerless the cups run low and need refilling. When the cup is low the negative behaviors begin. The author feels that at these ages 3 through teen years, the fastest and most effective way to fill the love cup is by playing with your children. Most of his examples are with the work he has done with his child and his patients. He tells of certain games that can be played to overcome<br />this or that, such as how to deal with the child who wants to play guns and shoot at the parent, how to deal with swearing, what to do when the child is hyper and aggressive, etc. He made this seem so very simple that I didn't believe it would work. I also at first, didn't want to think my own children would ever need this. But I started using it immediately with my 4<br />YO and it DOES WORK.<br />The author discusses the negative issues of permissiveness and the negative aspects of the opposite extreme of over-strictness/authoritarian style of discipline. Regarding punishment methods, the author also is against yelling, threatening, or using verbal abusive techniques such as shaming as well as physical methods such as hitting in any way or spanking. He is also against using time-outs for punishment and explains why they don't work but instead foster more feelings of isolation and detachment. He discusses why letting a baby \\"cry it out\\" should not be done. The author is also against behavior modification tactics such as rewards and bribes, giving a brief overview of why they fail in the end, then he suggests reading \\"Punished by Rewards\\" for more detailed information.<br />The author is supportive of attachment in infancy and continuing throughout the teen years. The author interestingly enough never mentions actions to be taken in infancy that would secure an attachment. If you are looking for ways to foster this attachment in your birth through two year old I would recommend books on the subject of attachment parenting such as \\"The Baby Book\\" or \\"The Discipline Book\\", both written by William Sears MD and his wife Martha Sears RN. However, \\"Playful Parenting\\" expands on the information outlined by the Sears' and this book gives more tools and techniques while the essence of this book flows seamlessly from the philosophy as the Sears'.<br />Unlike other parenting book author \\"experts\\", Cohen is able to give the special perspective of a psychologist and really gives some useful information, psychological-wise, on the importance of fostering a close connection with our children and how and why these exercises (play therapy) can and does work. Cohen does not use psychological terminology and the writing style is easy for parents to read and understand. While some other parenting books identify certain behaviors as \\"normal\\" for this age or that age, Cohen cites these behaviors as signals that the child is in need of some attention (via play) and once given, the behavior stops. (I recently read a parenting book by psychologists that simply listed multiple negative behaviors as normal for that age. I prefer Cohen's book because he cites the reason for it and suggests solutions.)<br />He talks about power struggles and about parents who don't like to play,<br />that are serious all the time or preoccupied and begs parents to loosen up<br />and play with the kids.<br />Near the end of the book he does discuss individual issues of importance<br />such dealing with children's sex play, sibling rivalry, gun play, etc.<br />Lastly, Cohen admits throughout the book that as a parent he is not perfect and that he even has to sometimes push himself to get down and play Barbie games with his daughter. He does not write with a holier-than-thou attitude. I've done a lot of reading about parenting but have never read anything as great as Cohen's theory and ideas for parenting the three-plus year old.<br />I'm glad to see this is now out in paperback, the low paperback price will be appreciated by parents.ge or that age, Cohen cites these behaviors as signals that the child is in need of some attention (via play) and once given, the behavior stops.

He was exposed to younger children and babies who were friends and relatives, and began forming different opinions about learning, which he shares in this book. Holt is fascinated by the notion that children accomplish so much before formal schooling begins and realizes that the way school is set up goes directly in opposition to what is natural and has worked for these children up to the point they are sent off to school.<br />The beginning of the book covers the age ranges from birth up through age 3 to 5, that is, before children go to school. Holt talks about a certain type of important learning that takes place up until the time a child enrolls in school at which point the experience of schooling changes their personality. The book starts off with how children succeed in learning many important things and huge feats such as speaking and with proper grammar and pronunciation and walking without formal schooling and that children accomplish much learning without an adult being the facilitator of it. In general the style of writing is that Holt describes a situation and then gives his opinions of the learning experience. Sometimes Holt does little experiments such as introducing a toy or a non-toy (such as a typewriter) to young children to see how they react to it and what they do with it. Holt observes with delight and amazement, these young children who are friends and relatives (they are not his students or participants in a research projects). It is clear that Holt enjoys these young children and he respects them and relishes the time he spends with them.<br />This revised edition makes clear which text is original then what was added-which is new perspective as he had spent more time around children and his theories matured and changed a bit. Seeing the two perspectives clearly was very interesting and educational.<br />Regarding the discussions about babies and toddlers there are good observations here and I appreciate them. As a stay at home parent, I have already witnessed much of this (and more) and for some of the chapters I felt I wasn't learning anything I hadn't already witnessed with my own two eyes.  However, readers who are childless will definitely learn much about how learning happens from infancy and up. I highly recommend that anyone interested in going into the profession of teaching read this book, or any current teacher who is childless. Holt gives the children much-deserved respect for their innate ability to learn and figure out the world around them.<br />Later chapters get more analytical as Holt integrates his own observation of schooled children (about grade 5 and below) and compares and contrasts with other educators, scientists and child psychologists. (It doesn't seem to me that Holt is analyzing preteens or teenagers.) Here is where Holt exercises his ability to write clearly and concisely drive home his point in a convincing manner.<br />Again and again Holt shows how a child to is forced to \\"learn\\" things (such as in public and most private schools) is actually having their personality changed in the process. The act of being forced to do things and to prove oneself over and over via testing and not being trusted by adults changes their personality. Holt feels the schooling procedures have negative consequences on all children; albeit some children are more negatively affected than others. The child can develop anxiety, mistrust, and fear of all adults not to mention self-esteem problems or just killing their curiosity or interest in learning.<br />Great quotes from other books on education and learning are included here with Holt's reactions. A short list of books on school reform is included. The summary alone is almost worth the price of the book.<br />For more specific information about what goes on in school and how children learn to play the school game and how forced teaching is not always effective, read Holt's \\"How Children Fail\\".<br />This would make a great gift for expectant parents, I feel it would point out to them that babies deserve a lot of respect for being able to figure out the world around them. This notion of being in awe of and respectful of children starting at birth is seldom written about...so many of us were under the misguided notion that an adult must be the one to force learning onto babies and children (me included until I birthed my babies and saw firsthand how smart they are).For more specific information about what goes on in school and how children learn to play the school game and how forced teaching is not always effective, read Holt's \\"How Children Fail\\".<br />This would make a great gift for expectant parents, I feel it would point out to them that babies deserve a lot of respect for being able to figure out the world around them.

US	51212167	R2WWZNHE2G07FB	0698113578	973715952	The Five Chinese Brothers (Paperstar)	Books	1	9	54	N	N	About how to lie in court to avoid punishment for a crime	I bought this book from Amazon based on the positive reviews on the site. Both my husband and I were upset at the content and lessons being taught in this book.<br />Each of the five identical-looking brothers has a different supernatural power. One power is to suck up all the water in the ocean in the man's mouth; they do this to catch fish to eat and then he lets the water back into the sea. A young boy is thrilled by this power and asks this man to do it so he can walk around and collect pretty shells and such treasures. The young boy does not come back in to shore, he goes against the directions and so when the man must let the water back into the ocean the young boy is drowned. (This drowning of a young boy may be scary and reason enough to avoid this book for young readers...)<br />The man is brought to trial for the death of the boy. Just like in America, a killing need not be pre-planned to be punishable by law (manslaughter vs. first-degree murder). The punishment is the death penalty. This alone is another thing to think about: do we want to have this subject matter as entertainment for young children? At the time we read this to our son he was four and we had not yet educated him about execution for crimes committed. Quite a heavy subject for this age range, I think.<br />The different methods of killing are outlined and tried, ... head being cut off with a sword, drowning, burning to death on a stake, and then by smothering him. ...<br />My other issues with this story are introducing the death penalty to young children and going into detail about the cruel ways to accomplish this... What images and ideas are we putting into the minds of young children? (The publisher lists this book for age ranges of 4-8 years old.)<br />I take seriously what message books and stories are conveying...I won't be reading this to our children any more.	2002-09-16
US	51212167	R8XJYNPYCAKEE	0930192362	383096247	The Home School Manual, 7th ed.: Plans, Pointers, Resons and Resources (Home School Manual: Plans, Pointers, Reasons, & Resources)	Books	1	37	44	N	N	how to make your homeschool like American public schools	This book recommends that homeschooling be done one way and one way: that it be modeled exactly like American public schools, right down to regular test taking, giving and tracking grades, and attendance record-keeping.<br />The tone of the book is insulting and at times negative about homeschooling and about the thoughts and opinions of the homeschooling parent. I feel that some parts can actually instill fear in the parent and the author then recommends that unless things are done his recommended way, then the child should go to public school instead. I felt this book was dis-empowering rather than empowering.<br />You should be aware this book is very religious in content; the books front and back cover don't divulge this tidbit.<br />The book is over 500 pages long, and the pages are large-sized. There is a lot of text but the organization of the chapters is illogical and confusing. Anyone intersted in homeschooling would be better off with a shorter book that is more concise and &quot;to the point&quot;. Many of the writings by Wade make statements but these are not flushed out in detail-but then bits and pieces of that subject are mentioned here and there throughout the book. For example it mentions the benefit and necessity of knowing your child's learning style but then doesn't immediately explain anything about them let alone leave the reader feeling empowered to learn about it and then apply it.<br />You will like this book if it is your desire to model your homeschool exactly as the public schools, including using the same curriculum as they do. If you like being told there is one right way to do things, then this authors writing won't offend you. This book is not for you if you like to read about different homeschooling methods and then come to your own conclusions. Please know that if you do like this book and start out this way and it is not working, there are loads of other resources about other ways to homeschool, ways that are more flexible and define education in different ways than the public education system does. There are other books, magazines, and homeschooling support groups that enlighten you about different ways to homeschool so that you can custom design what works best for your child(ren) and you.<br />More about what I don't like about this book:<br />The first chapters start right off on a negative tone. Wade is a school administrator and much of the beginning of this book reads more like a policy manual for a public school. On page 36, Wade warns parents that choosing to pull their child out of school \\"may teach the child the wrong lesson\\". This is one example of the insulting language he uses to refer to a homeschooling parent's decision to remove the child from school is because \\"your mother hen instinct got all fluffed up because your little chick wasn't assigned to the advanced reading group\\". He is careful not to state anything negative about the public school system, which he still works within.<br />The author perpetuates myths that have clearly been debunked by others who have successfully homeschooled their children. It is sad to see these old myths included as fact in a book that is supposed to be supportive of homeschooling. Examples are that the majority of people homeschool for religious reasons and that homeschoolers have less socialization than schooled children.<br />The beauty of homeschooling is that learning can happen in different ways, custom designed to different learners. This book talks about how Wade feels homeschooling must look: it is a narrowly defined system that mirrors the American public education system. Wade is open to the unit-study approach that is initiated by the parent. Wade is opposed to children learning about what they are interested in, also known as \\"self-directed learning\\", \\"interest driven learning\\" and \\"unschooling\\". Wade openly states his opposition to various homeschooling methods such as unschooling (85) and classical education (89), such as outlined in \\"The Well Trained Mind\\". Wade makes it clear he doesn't like any curriculum that differs from the public schools and states that if a parent does not follow the public school curriculum then \\"you should let a more traditional school do the job\\". It is interesting to me that Wade is not only biased toward school but toward public school. To be so closed minded about educational choices, even to rule out various private school methodologies (such as Waldorf or Montessori) is amazing to me, and it shows his closed-mindedness with regard to education.<br />Some of this book actually is not at all applicable to the homeschool environment. The parent is called the teacher and the child is a student (which I find annoying). Textbooks are said to be the most important educational tool that will be used (68) and he recommends getting the same educational materials as your public school system uses. I thought it was widely known that textbooks contain many errors and are boring to boot. I could go on and on about what upset me about this book but will stop here. Please be aware there are more positive books on the market for beginning homeschoolers such as those by Linda Dobson and Mary Griffith, and great magazines such as \\"Home Education Magazine\\". There are loads of books about the problems with public education such as those by John Holt, John Taylor Gatto, Jonathan Kozol and James Herndon.ined in \\"The Well Trained Mind\\".

US	51212167	R3DW7N4P9PN8ID	0966793102	914075664	True Stories of X-Amish: Banned - Shunned - Excommunicated	Books	5	91	99	N	Y	why some Amish sought freedom & the bad side of Amish life	This was the second book about the Amish that I read to satisfy my curiosity about Amish life. The stories in this book were written from interviews with people who have left the Amish life for various reasons. Before I read it I worried that the goal of the book was to slam the Amish revenge purposes or some other bad reason. After reading the book I realized that these are the stories of people in search of freedom, usually religious freedom. Others left to avoid sexual or physical abuse. Being an American I cannot be upset with x-Amish who are seeking the life that they want for themselves in the name of freedom and/or religious freedom. It is interesting to note that the Amish left Germany in the 1800s to seek religious freedom but according to this book, the community that was set up then prevented those born into the faith from practicing that same religious freedom. Because the Amish are born into the faith they are faced with a choice in their late teens to either join the Amish religion or to leave the community and never speak to their Amish relatives and friends again-what a tough choice if one has some doubt about whether to join the church or not.<br />Reading this book allowed me to picture Amish life in more of a balanced and normal way than reading my first book \\"Rosanna of the Amish\\" which was written by a happy Amish man-it romanticized the Amish life and didn't have any negative aspects of Amish life. The complete lack of anything negative was suspicious to me. I was left wondering if Amish life was sheer perfection with all happiness and love (albeit laden with hard physical weather and lacking in comforts such as the use of running water and indoor plumbing).<br />Some Amish people commit crimes but the Amish try to get the charges dropped in the American law system and they deal with (or not deal with) matters in their own way. I learned that children begin hard physical labor at a young age and that boys of 5 years old are doing the work of a full-grown man. Using some of the equipment is dangerous and it is reported that at least one major injury or death happens per week to children while performing hard labor tasks. Also it was mentioned that verbal acknowledgment of emotions (love) and physical affection (hugs and kisses) from parent to child is not done in the Amish world. Sharing emotion is looked down upon (how sad). Spanking and harsh beatings are the norm even for accidents or for slow manual labor according to a story in the book.<br />This book made me realize that some Amish are as curious about the non-Amish as some of us are about them. Some younger Amish sneak in bits and pieces of \\"English\\" life. For example, some teens sneak out at night to drink alcohol and take illegal drugs experimentally, much the same as some American teens do. Some \\"English\\" sneak money to Amish children who sneak to buy candy or portable radios (both are prohibited). In one case an Amish girl is not taught about sexuality or pregnancy and ends up surprised to find herself a pregnant as an unmarried teen. Some Amish families experience incest, physical and verbal abuse, just as in American culture.<br />The most stunning thing I learned was that the Amish use a Bible written in high German whilst the women are only allowed to learn Pennsylvania Dutch and English languages and are prevented from attending school past the 8th grade. Bible study is prohibited and only the ministers are allowed to read a Bible. This means that the Amish rely solely on the ministers to relay the information in the Bible. Several of the x-Amish in this book explain that most of the hundreds of rules imposed on how the Amish may live are written by the religious men and are not directly stated in the Bible even though they are told they are living as the Bible instructs. Simply being caught reading a Bible can result in ex-communication. Hearing the stories about people leaving the Amish in search of living what they perceive as a more true religious Christian life was enlightening and interesting to me. This book tells stories and opinions of how some people have found inconsistencies in the content Bible vs. what the Amish ministers say is in the Bible. (They were able in various ways to get a copy of a Bible in English and began reading it themselves and having conversations with non-Amish about Bible content, which is against the rules.)<br />The book also describes how different Amish settlements may have different rules such as manner of dress and what types of machinery are allowed. The differences between Amish and Mennonite are explained as are the exact definitions of banned, shunned, and ex-communicated.<br />I found this book enlightening. It is a fast read, easily read in a few hours. Be cautioned that some of the content is not suitable for young children, such as details about father/daughter incest and sexual abuse.ue religious Christian life was enlightening and interesting to me.

The illustrations are very nicely done although they are not as detailed or done in color as on the cover (just so you know what to expect).<br />All the important issues are discussed in a non-frightening yet serious manner and without providing too much detail about what can happen during a sexual abuse encounter. My goal is to educate my male children about prevention of sexual abuse without enlightening them with details about what actually can and does happen during a sexual abuse encounter; there is an element of innocence I wish to protect at their young ages of two and five.<br />This is the sequence of the content of this story:<br />Privacy is defined and several examples are given, and private body parts are described as those covered by a bathing suit. The body parts for both girls and boys are named here using the proper terminology for both male and female genitals and the term \\"bottom\\" for the buttocks and anal area. The girl states she already knows that no one can touch her in any way she doesn't like, whether it involves her private parts or any other part of her body, such as not wanting to sit on her uncle's lap. Examples of touching that are enjoyed are given such as cuddling with a dog and dancing with Dad. Tickling is described as fun but that sometimes it can go too far and no longer be fun. The girl is encouraged to say \\"no\\" to anyone at any time if she doesn't want them touching her (in sexual or non-sexual ways without using the term \\"sexual\\"). The mother explains that it is the feelings of the girl that are most important, not the person who she is asking to stop or saying no to, because the girl worried that if she said no she would hurt the feelings of the other person. The mother warns the girl not to allow anyone to touch her private parts or take photos of them, and she should not touch the private parts of another person. The offending person is said to possibly be a stranger or someone she knows such as a friend or relative. The girl is told to shout \\"no\\" and to run the other way, then to tell the parent or caregiver or teacher what happened.<br />The only thing that I think would make this a more perfect book would be if the parent were talking to a brother and sister at the same time and if the example of touching that the child didn't like was not the stereotypical and common example of adult male with young girl. I'd prefer more examples to illustrate that a boy can be abused as well as a girl. I am amazed that children's books about prevention of sexual abuse never give the example that a boy can be a victim, or that both males and females can be an abuser. Lastly, the mother warns against older children inappropriately touching her and I think it should simply say \\"other children\\" as abuse can happen with both younger and same-aged peers. Despite these few issues, this is the best book that I have found to read aloud to my children and I do highly recommend it. Regarding my complaints, I realize that I can address these issues in conversations with my boys.s said to possibly be a stranger or someone she knows such as a friend or relative.

US	51212167	R2RMXVQW556S2Y	0913677175	656653210	The Beginners Guide to Homeschooling	Books	2	13	14	N	N	Not much information for too much money	This review is for the third revised edition dated April 2000.<br />As a homeschooling mother I am grateful for the work of John Holt, Patrick Farenga and have learned so much from the Holt Associates publication \\"Growing Without Schooling\\". It saddens me to give this book a low rating to a book written by Patrick Farenga.<br />If you have already read one book about homeschooling then it is likely that this book won't reveal any new information to you. I guess I am spoiled by the large number of books about homeschooling that are on the market today...there are so many books, especially books categorized as books for beginning homeschoolers that provide more words of encouragement, more detailed source lists and more detailed reviews. Because I'd already read a couple of books on the subject of beginning homeschooling I found that I already knew the almost all the information in this book.<br />This book would be most helpful if it were the first book you ever read about homeschooling and then when you chose what area you wanted to learn more about you could go in that direction and find more detailed sources of information, whether it is a book or an internet web site.<br />Despite being written by someone who supports unschooling, Farenga does a good job covering various homeschooling styles and over 30 pages are dedicated to matters such as curriculum, record keeping and performance assessments. The book is so short that the various homeschooling styles are all covered briefly.<br />I found that the most interesting part of the book were quotes from out of print books published in the early part of the 20th century. One book published in 1912 titled \\"The School in the Home\\" about how the public schools in America are failing and not measuring up to parents expectations, despite the high cost to run them. This was a surprise to me as I keep hearing that schools should change back to the way they were \\"in the good old days\\" when the schools were inexpensive, well run, and churned out well-educated students. It appears to me now that American public schools were never that great. Another out of print book titled \\"A Mother's Letters to a Schoolmaster\\" published in 1923 has detailed quotes covering six pages in which she explains her frustration with the school. Another book from 1950 titled \\"The home education of a boy\\" is briefly quoted about the success of a boy who was home schooled successfully back then.<br />The resource list of \\"correspondence schools or curriculum suppliers\\" gives names and mailing addresses (no phone or web sites) for suppliers but fails to differentiate between which they are. The list doesn't explain anything about these suppliers such as what they sell. I guess I am accustomed to lists provided on the Internet which give free information at least about whether it is a correspondence school and Christian or not, etc. Books such as Rebecca Rupp's The Complete Home Learning Source Book\\" and Jean and Donn Reed's \\"The Home School Source Book\\". Also the detailed reviews on www.Amazon.com and on [...] provide free detailed information.  Ads in homeschooling magazines reveal most of the names of the companies listed here and also contain some information to help you understand what they sell and what they are about (Christian, etc.).<br /><br />In this short book 24 pages are dedicated to listing contact information for homeschool support organizations in the United States and in other countries. Most or all of this information can now be found for free on the Internet by doing a simple search with a search engine. Many homeschool support groups or publications (such as Home Education Magazine) provide long guides of information for beginners that are free to download from their websites. I urge you to do a search for your local homeschooling support group and see what detailed information they provide for beginners as your first starting point. Then when you figure out what you'd like to learn more aboutseek out books on that specialized subject.<br />A stellar book that answers many common questions with several different people writing answers to every question is \\"The Homeschooling Book of Answers : The 88 Most Important Questions Answered by Homeschooling's Most Respected Voices\\" by Linda Dobson, editor.

US	51212167	R1WLMD4G6PVYQX	0971537402	376260955	I'm Made of Mama's Milk	Books	3	4	15	N	N	About toddler nursing, great text, poor quality graphics	The text is all about nursing and is well written. Rhyming words used to describe the nursing relationship are snuggly, warm, and heavenly. The benefits of nursing are extolled for its' nutritional benefits and its nurturing benefits. I absolutely love the text of this book and feel it definitely portrays the nursing habits of a newborn baby and going more toward hitting the first birthday.<br />My issues are with the illustrations. This book features mostly illustrations of a toddler nursing. The toddler looks to be at least 18 months old if not over 2 years old. There are a couple of shots where the baby looks about 9 months old. There are no shots of newborns or young babies. I mention this because the title and the description on the back cover don't clearly state that this book portrays images of a toddler nursing. Due to the very low number of children's books on the market with nursing toddlers. Both of my children were/are being nursed as toddlers. I'd appreciate the marketing, the title, and/or the back cover to make clear that this is about nursing toddlers because I am sure that would help increase sales and ensure it would find its' way to the families who would most appreciate this book.<br />This nursling is shown nursing in morning, throughout the day, and during the night, anyplace and anywhere. I would like people to know that while some toddlers do nurse in this frequent manner, not all babies over 6 months or children aged 12 months or older nurse so frequently (neither of mine nursed this frequently but I know toddlers that do and whose mothers are happy with it). Every child is unique. If you are a mother of a newborn just be aware that the experience as portrayed in this book is not a guarantee that this will be your future experience. I personally know some mothers who weaned before their baby's first birthday because they did not want to have a one-year old who nursed non-stop and everywhere as is portrayed in this book.<br />Another issue that people ask me about in my role of a lay breastfeeding counselor is nursing discreetly and in public. I am pro-nursing in public. I know nursing can be done discreetly and that this is in total control and choice of the nursing mother. The way the baby is held, the clothing worn, and the manner in which the clothing and baby is positioned all can be done in a way that the breast does not have to be exposed to others. Also nursing in a sling can be done in a manner so that the breast is not exposed and also can be done so that no one even knows the baby is nursing at all. I have seen mothers be counseled about this and seen them be happy with these tips for discreet nursing and/or use of the sling for discreet nursing. I know that some relatives, husbands, and sometimes even the mother that are uncomfortable with the idea of the breast being exposed during nursing while in public. I know some mothers who have cited this discomfort turn to formula bottle-feeding in public and/or go through extensive pumping so they can use a bottle of breastmilk to feed their baby in public because they mistakenly think that nursing in public requires exposure of the breast to anyone who looks at them. In this book, the illustrations show that mother is nursing in public using no discretion. Her breast is not only very large but is out, all the way, everywhere. In every scene of breastfeeding a large portion or the entire breast is totally exposed.  Even when she has the opportunity to nurse discreetly when wearing a button-down shirt she chose to button from top down exposing her whole side of her chest and breast. The illustrations when nursing in a sling the breast is out all the way and the sling is positioned in a way that the exposed breast is visible to us instead of being positioned in a way that the sling covers it. Personally I am immune to the sight of bare breasts and it doesn't bother me, but I acknowledge that others don't share this attitude and use this issue to puta negative spin on breastfeeding and may cite it as a reason for weaning.<br />A major concern is the high cost of the book with poor illustration-quality. Most board books are half the price of this book. The images have large grain and are fuzzy. They appear to be computer enhanced, such as the poor background colors and unnatural backgrounds (pink sky, beige background solid for the nature path scene).<br />With all this said, I acknowledge that children's books that portray nursing as a main subject matter are rare and books that portray toddler nursing are even more rare. This is the only board format book that I know of that is about nursing a toddler. The narrator's voice from the perspective of the child is wonderful and I really love the text.<br />If you can overlook the quality of the illustrations, don't mind the breast exposure and this nursing pattern is one that is similar to yours, I am sure you will love this book.

US	51212167	R2CIGMX1SID20N	0964115352	919471079	Bounce Back into Shape After Baby: The Ultimate Guide to a Fun-Filled, Time and Energy Efficient WorkoutWith Your Baby	Books	5	43	43	N	N	Much different than other exercise books, a must-have	This is a gentle, flexible exercise routine that begins with exercise routines suitable 24 hours after birth that start off with 5 minutes of floor exercises (with no balance ball or other equipment at this point) and 5 minutes of walking.<br />The goal for the first level of exercises is not to lose weight but to enhance the mothers' physical condition and to enhance recovery after childbirth. There are special exercises to help heal c-section incision area and simple things to do to help prevent c-section scar adhesions. Other exercises help episiotomy site healing, separation of diastasis recti (abdominal muscles) due to pregnancy and exercises for recovering from urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence (which has been linked in a study to be caused by episiotomies).<br />Another important focus of the book is the goal of not having back pain. The book teaches prevention of back and shoulder injury by teaching proper positions for holding baby, breastfeeding, and lifting baby up, such as when lifting out of crib. Using a stroller is discouraged if the woman has carpal tunnel syndrome due to pregnancy as pushing the stroller can further aggravate the pain and the condition. Use of a front pack baby carrier is recommended as a back-healthy way to carry baby and proper usage of it (so it is comfortable and doesn't cause back pain) is outlined by the author. I have witnessed many people wearning their baby carriers in a way that causes back pain, I encourage everyone to read the manufacturers directions and this authors' directions so using this style baby carrier doesn't cause you pain!<br />The program progresses in stages up to a 5-star difficulty rating, as the woman desires to get into physical shape with increased aerobic activity designed for fat burning, weight loss and increased muscle strength.<br />The book features cutout one-sided pages that illustrate an entire workout by name, order, and illustration so the mother can carry it with her for reference rather than propping up the book and trying to keep the book open during the workout. Later in the book are the longer, detailed instructions for each exercise.<br />There are loads of references to studies on everything from why a vaginal birth is easier on a woman's body to why an episiotomy can cause a woman physical problems to why breastfeeding is beneficial. I was surprised to see so many studies cited throughout the text and in side bar quotes.<br />Other than some stretching exercises, breathing and abdominal exercies, the baby is incorporated into the routine (but it looks to me that this is only possible when the baby can strongly hold up his/her neck), which is great because doing the exercises won't require mother and baby separation. The exercises can be done in short segments multiple times during the day when the busy mother can carve out these small time segments.<br />Breastfeeding is portrayed in a positive light, including a photo of the author breastfeeding and with tidbits of positive research about breastfeeding's health benefits and personal opinions of the author about enhancing bonding between mother and baby.<br />An attitude and emphasis on the woman being the expert of her body is throughout. It begins with self-tests for separation of abdominal exercises, Kegel muscle self tests, etc. and urges the woman to listen to her own body. Using the information in this book the woman can design her own workout schedule and assess her own body's strengths, weaknesses and areas that would benefit from exercising. This book does not promote reliance on exercise clubs, gyms, etc. so this is a low-expense workout. The balance ball that is used in later parts of the text costs about $30 and can be used in the home (which is far less money than most exercise shoes cost).<br />I especially appreciated that this book does not portray pregnancy or childbirth in a negative light. It is not like other books that almost treat pregnancy as a bad thing for making the woman gain weight and other body changes occur that are negative. It does *not* have the attitude that as soon as the baby is born a mission must begin to get in shape and lose fat. There is no negative language about the physical appearance of the body while pregnant or after the baby is born. The book is more focused on feeling good, developing strong core muscles, and being able to live pain-free.<br />This is not a killer-workout that requires huge amounts of time and energy; it is definitely do-able at all the stages of difficulty, and will definitely help any mother who uses it.making the woman gain weight and other body changes occur that are negative.

Because the author did the writing, the writing style and length of each chapter is consistent throughout the book. However I felt that lost in this process was a real emotional voice of each family. Half way through the book I didn't even want to finish it (but I persevered hoping it would get better). For example sometimes they tell why they homeschool but there just is no real emotion there. I was unable to really feel the flavor of some of the families and I had trouble feeling empathy for them. Each chapter is more like a summary of what some key points are in their lives (religious beliefs and if that affects homeschooling, curriculum used, what style of homeschooling they consider themselves, etc.).<br />Another reason I was disappointed is that it is mentioned which curriculum is used but the reasons for choosing that brand over another is often not given. Also reasons for not using other brands is missing as well as if they tried a brand and it didn't work out and they switched brands.<br />The majority of the families in this book had 4 children and more, one had 9 children and two families have 11 children. Completely lacking in all the chapters is anything that really acknowledges what life with so many kids is really like. I have two children and honestly cannot even imagine life with 11 children let alone homeschooling 11 children! I wanted to hear more details, more real information and perhaps why and how a family comes to a decision to have so many children. Other mysteries to me are how they can afford to have so many children on one income and if the parents plan to fund their college educations or, if the children do go to college will they make the students pay their own way?<br />The introduction to the book promised to reveal to us what life is really like for these families. I did read the book through to the end but was left without a real feeling but rather a nicely packaged summary of specific points of information was given. Sometimes a major focus took up a chapter, such as one families court struggles to fight to homeschool with $10K in legal bills and was living virtually paycheck to paycheck and the father in jail, then the author reveals it was the wife's mother who turned them in but not a morsel of comment afterward about how the family dealt with that and how they even had a relationship after that happened! All the build up about the trial and then we get the blow that the children's grandmother was the source of the problem and then not to tell us what happened from there...the subject was just dropped! Another family's chapter was loaded with information about the family's musical lifestyle, which I thought was excessive (and uninteresting) while describing regular homeschooling life with these 11 children was not really addressed.<br />Some of the families are religious and some are not. A great deal of time is spent explaining on family's religion of Judaism, as if the readers know nothing about it. On the other hand with the Christians it is assumed that we all know about it, disappointing that the two religions were not treated equally with regard to scope of explanation.<br />The families represent a variety of homeschooling styles from Charlotte Mason to unschooling. I thought the unschoolers were portrayed a bit less intelligent than I am sure they are, with not much explanation about why they choose that method of learning (which I can assure you, the unschooling parents I know of, do put a lot of thought into it and usually have strong opinions on why it is the best route for learning for their children). Better stories of unschoolers can be found in past issues of the now defunct magazine Growing Without Schooling and in some articles published in Home Education Magazine.<br />The families are all American and one family is posted with the military on an island in the Pacific.I found that no matter where they lived in the country there were more similarities aligned with their homeschooling style and/or religious beliefs rather than it mattering where they live geographically which was interesting.<br />I liked that the beginning of each chapter had a photo and highlights of their favorite resources, best advice received, worst advice received and favorite quote, but these are lists and no explanation for why they like a certain resource is given which was disappointing to me.<br />As a comparison to other books on the market that tell stories about homeschooling families:  Nancy Lande has two books, the first is \\"Homeschooling: a patchwork of days\\" in which 30 families wrote their own chapter of a day in their life. The sequel by Nancy Lande is \\"Homeschool Open House\\" in which 30 new families are featured with a 5-year follow up of an additional 27 families. Lande's two books have smaller font and lots of more detail. Those who read Lande's books and felt there was too much detail would probably like this book very much. Those who loved all the detail of Lande's books will probably find \\"Real-life homeschooling\\" a fast read, short, and lacking in depth of information. One thing I loved about Lande's books was that the families usually said why they like a certain math curriculum over another, which they tried and disliked, which is good for a certain learning style and other great information that is hard to find in homeschooling catalogs or from the curriculum vendors themselves!<br />Another great book loaded with detail written by an unschooling mother is \\"Learning at Home: a mother's guide to homeschooling, revised edition\\" by Marty Layne. As with the Lande books this goes into detail about how she taught her children to read, what resources she likes and dislikes and why and other useful information such as preventing homeschooling-mother burnout.<br />If you have not yet read a book that discusses how homeschoolers spend their time perhaps this would be a good book to read. If after reading this you are left craving more detail then move on to Nancy Lande's books and Marty Layne's book.c.

US	51212167	RF7R5HZCCEE38	0836190181	323431189	Rosanna of the Amish	Books	5	19	22	N	N	a son's story about his mother, interesting!`	The author is the son of the main character, Rosanna. Rosanna is the daughter of an Irish immigrant who is born around 1840 (my estimate as it is never given in the book). Rosanna's mother dies following Rosanna's birth. She is given to an Amish family on a temporary basis. When her father dies some months later, she ends up being permanently adopted and rasied by this old order Amish woman who later marries and bears more children.<br />The author tells this interesting story, all the while weaving information about the lives of the old order Amish. I found this an interesting read. Explanations for why the Amish do things the way they do are given. There are details about their religious services, weddings, and funerals. Why they refuse to buy medical or fire insurance, why they refuse government aide, and why they refuse to fight in American wars is all explained.<br />The author ends up going to college and later leaves the old order Amish to become a Mennonite. The old order Amish don't allow attending college as the author chose to do, to further his formal training as a teacher, so he had to change religious affiliations.<br />What is missing from this book is a true spirit for Rosanna as a woman. Specifically, there is not much emotion or thoughts about certain things such as what it is like to mother children. There was virtually nothing about the experience of pregnancy, childbirth from her point of view, or how she could balance all that work and rearing so many children. The emotional aspect of losing her only daughter when she was just a toddler was not really elaborated on. I understand that it may be the custom to not verbally express emotions but I refuse to believe that emotions are not experienced...then again, if she was quiet about expressing her emotions I guess she would not have told her son therefore making these thoughts impossible for him to know and write about. Also missing was an explanation for what an Amish childhood is like, how much do they play and work? How much do they contribute to the laborious farm work the families accomplish? How does a busy Amish mother have time to pamper and enjoy her newborn baby? Also I'd like some parenting information such as common philosophies such as \\"is corporal punishment used\\"?<br />Something else that I would have appreciated is a bit of an overview of the differences between the different orders and about the differences with the Mennonites. A better explanation of when and why people are ex-communicated, banned or shunned would put things more in perspective. There is nothing about this except a couple of sentences of inferred information. To get that information will take further research and reading.<br />The account of the old order Amish is tastefully and respectfully written about in this book. I think this would make a great read aloud book for young children or as a book for a young person to read to themselves, perhaps if learning about American history or just to satisfy a curiosity about the Amish. There is nothing in here that is controversial such as sexual content. Since they live such a clean and virtuous life, there is nothing that needs censoring here for young children.<br />The old order Amish are portrayed as a content, happy, and peaceful people. If we each changed a few things we non-Amish do to follow in their footsteps we'd be all the better for it.do they play and work?

We are taken on a journey around the world, at one hour increments to see what is happening. Some of the time frames are strange, like a 2 am snack in the pantry in England!<br />We see a child getting read a bedtime story in Brooklyn NY USA, partying in Puerto Rico, shopping at market in China, barbeque in Australia, handcrafting in Samoa, etc.<br />The pictures are cute, with lots going on in the illustrations to talk about. There isn't a real story here, I assume the point is to show various cultures and talk about the detailed illustrations. The only thing that bothers me is the snapshot of what they are doing can be so limiting, for example, having England illustrated as snacking in the middle of the night and Russia being depicted as a cat knocking an item over and waking up the inhabitants of the house. How real is that of a depiction of their society? It is a cute book but doesn't have enough of a true depiction of different countries for the parent to have a discussion with the child.<br />For a taste of other cultures I prefer \\"Children Like Me\\".	2002-07-17

This is a cute and captivating tale of Frances, the picky eater who only wants to eat bread and jam. Her parents handle her food refusal by indulging her with bread and jam at every meal and snack. She soon tires of it and wants to eat what everyone else is eating: a well-rounded meal.<br />This is a cute tale with little rhymes that Frances sings to herself with her food musings. The illustrations are adorable, they are not a visual assault as some other children's books have. This book was first published in the 1960s and as with other picture books of that time, has nice long prose, a good length of a story.<br />Both parents and children who deal with fussy eaters will appreciate this funny tale. It is a classic that is sure to be a favorite!	2002-07-17

Each chapter is a different short story about the owner of the painting at various times in the last few hundred years. Some stories are great, interesting and page-turners while others are not. Some stories are boring and I felt no real connection to the characters as people. I put down the book about half way through and had a hard time picking it up again. What saved this from a lower rating was that the end contained several great short stories that I feel were the best stories in the book, so it ends with high quality page-turning stories.<br />I found it fun to find out the origins of the painting, we do find out who the girl in the painting is, however, I honestly cannot say it was suspenseful throughout. I found myself captivated by some stories and not wanting to put the book down, but then bored and wanting to skip the chapter of the next story.<br />Lastly, I was frustrated at the idea that the first character in the book was contemplating burning the painting. Although it was stolen by his Nazi father from a Jewish family, despite his disgust at his father being a Nazi and guilt over how it was attained, he didnt want to return the painting to the Jewish organization that takes back artwork stolen by Nazis. That he would consider burning such a lovely piece made absolutely no sense to me! The painting should have been returned to the Jewish organization.	2002-07-17

The pages are thick and spiral bound. The pages are laminated so the book can be used poolside for reference by parent when teaching the child these activities. The left side of the page is a beautiful scene: photographs of children enhanced by an artist with what looks like paint. There is rhyming prose under it. The intention is to read this aloud to your child to get them interested. The writings and pictures are themed, gliding, floating, etc. and go along with activities that are on the right side of the page.<br />The problems I have with the book are that I didnt realize this book doesnt start at the beginning. That is to say, I thought it would start with ideas for getting the child used to getting their face wet at first, then going under water. Tips for getting the child used to relaxing in the water so the parent can guide them to follow the directions. This book starts right off with the first activity of the child swimming underwater, unaided, through a hoop. I think that starting off with underwater activities assumes a lot of preparation work has already been done with either parents or by taking lessons. There is also no logical order to these activities. For example the 5th activity is to hum in the water and blow water at the surface. It would seem to me that this activity should have been first. Id prefer the activities to go logically from easy and then progressing to more difficult (or scary) activities. I also feel the safety precautions should go right up front as the first set of activities rather than being at the end as if an afterthought.<br />Now for what I like about the book. This is a short book; there is no fluff or filler here. I like that there are read aloud sections for the children. The way the reading is linked to fun activities is creative and unique. There is one photograph per activity. The directions are written clearly and concisely. The method is gentle and caring, which I appreciate. However, since there are no tips for getting off to this starting point such as how to first get the child to go all the way under with trust and confidence. There are some great tips I never though of such as after having the child jump in, dont hug them but turn them back to the wall and teach to climb out. The only problem for me is that with both my kids, to get them into the pool in the first place I had to hold them in my arms (especially since the depth in shallow end is still way over a baby or toddlers head). Therefore, children used to being carried and hugged in the water have a hard time resisting that, to follow the authors directions.<br />What is covered in this book is: swimming underwater, doing things underwater (fetching toys, etc.), relaxing on back to float on surface, encouraging to go deeper underwater, jumping off side, climbing out, pushing off from bottom and going upbobbing, proper kicking method, gliding, and safety precautions.<br />Overall this book has a lot of info in a concise format with beautiful visuals and with a caring and fun attitude toward these activities. Since there are limited books for parents on teaching our children how to swim, I recommend this book. I plan to use it but will have to come up with some kind of logical progression of easy to difficult.ich I appreciate.

That object is then shown in the illustration in the proper number of items. Each has a phrase \\"and one more\\", I guess to try to show addition but the illustrated sets are not grouped accordingly. For example there are 4 bumper cars all grouped together and it says \\"3 bumper cars and one more are 4\\". Well if they are going to do that I think there should be a set of 3 then a set of 1 as two separate groupings. I like the sidebar box on each page has the number, the images that total to that number, and the word spelled out for the item and the number. For example, poem about bumper car ride, then says in the box \\"4 bumper cars, four bumper cars\\" with illustration of 4 small bumper cars lined up. I like that the word and the number are both shown along with the image of that number objects.  The poems rhyme and have a good cadence.<br />The numbers 11 through 20 don't have a poem, just the image of that number of items then the phrase \\"15 and one more are 16. Sixteen hats\\" and so on. The only thing that I find confusing is this use of the phrase \\"and one more\\" when the illustration doesn't correspond. For example there are 15 balls all grouped together and then it says \\"14 balls and one more are 15\\". In another image there are 13 horns then the words \\"15 and one more are 16\\" and next to that in another grouping are 3 more horns. If you ask me it should day 13 and 3 more are 16 and in the other images of one large set of items it should simply state there are 15 or however many there really are.	2002-07-17

Both can talk, and they visit with each other. The mountain is lonely. The bird explains she will die someday, that birds don't live long, but promises she will have her daughter visit when she is gone. She explains that she cannot live there as this mountain is barren, so she can visit only once per year. The mountain is lonely when she passes on and cries (a brook begins). The daughter does visit and she drops one seed per year. In the end the mountain is a thriving ecosystem where birds and animals can live year round, nourished by the water that the mountain created.<br />The book has longer prose than the usual picture books for this age range (more like the picture books published in the 1950s and 1960s). The illustrations are by Eric Carle, interesting and appealing collage format that he is famous for.<br />This is a tender and touching tale!

It is a story of a (rabbit) family that goes apple picking in the fall. This is a New England tradition that I have enjoyed so the book is especially appealing to me. The family goes picking apples and the farmer goes along. The farmer explains some factual things such as how many seeds are usually in the apples and how they grow the trees from rootstock.<br />Each member of the family wants a different type of apple for a different purpose. The family cooks applesauce and the recipe is included. There is a song with music notations and directions for doing an apple printing craft.<br />This family enjoys learning about the apples and there are some factual pictures such as how the apple tree is grafted onto a root and a labeling of the parts of a bisected apple. I especially like how the story illustrates the children and parents as being interested in learning about the apples.<br />This is a fun storybook, a good mixture of story and facts with a few activities! This would make a great book for preschool or Kindergarten teaches, perfect for reading in the autumn or combining with a real trip to pick apples!	2002-07-17

This reference book is easy to use and understand. When I first leaned of this home edition version of the Merck manual I was hesitant. Over the years many books have been published that are medical in nature, some published by doctors, but the content is watered down or so vague that a layperson doesn't derive much information from it. Some books are actually condescending in attitude, some patronizing. So many books briefly skim symptoms and then caution to call a physician for more information.<br />Recently my son was diagnosed on the phone by our pediatrician with chicken pox and it was made clear that they did not want to see him for a physical exam. I was given a tiny bit of information by the office staff but was still curious for more information. I spent over an hour surfing the Internet looking for information but found watered down information, repeated many times over on multiple websites, including some written by physicians intended for laypeople to use. I looked at my parenting books written by doctors (one titled \\"The Portable Pediatrician\\", no less) and was still lacking any substantial information. When I consulted the Merck Manual home edition, (which I had forgotten I bought recently and had not yet used), I was surprised at the level of information given. There are many details that I had not found elsewhere, such as number of days from exposure to outbreak, how long it takes the pox to change from first appearance to crusted over, about how long the infection lasts, and treatment suggestions. Reasons why some children have a mild outbreak vs. a severe outbreak were even provided, something I had not found anywhere else.<br />The information here is not dumbed down in that it is not so vague that it is not useful. There is a lot of information here but it is written in a style for the layperson to understand. I appreciated the writing style, which presents information to the non-physician without putting on airs.<br />Anyone who, like me, prefers to gather information and learn about things rather than making a call or office visit to their doctor to get just one opinion will appreciate owning this book. At about 1500 pages it covers many illnesses and ailments. If you are interested in this book I suggest you buy it so that you have it at your fingertips 24 hours a day, for whatever may arise. I am not suggesting this take the place of a doctor, but I know from working with physicians that there are certain calls that are non-emergent in nature that are not appreciated when the office is closed!<br />If you are looking for a book about children's ailments that encompasses not only western medicine but lists an array of other treatment methods, I suggest Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child: A Practical A-To-Z Reference to Natural and Conventional Treatments for Infants and Children by Janet Zand. I found this to be an excellent companion to the Merck manual, home edition. The Merck manual gives more information about the disease or ailment itself through a Western medicine viewpoint while the Zand's books' specialty is sharing treatment options grouped by category (herbal, homeopathic, western, etc.).ers to gather information and learn about things rather than making a call or office visit to their doctor to get just one opinion will appreciate owning this book.

Some of the characters are sad and pathetic and make what I think are bad choices, but the author writes in such a way that we \\"get inside their head\\" and I was able to understand in almost every case, why each character made the choices and took the actions that they took. It is the type of book where I found myself wanting to tell the character what to do or not to do, and to give them my own two cents worth of advice! The characters are so well described it was if I knew them personally.<br />I was riveted to this book and did not want to put it down. I found myself laughing at some parts and crying in many parts (but not depressing).<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough. A perfect escape-from-your-life book, a great summer read. I only wished some of my friends had read it so that I could call them and talk about what was happening! This would make a great book club selection because there is so much to talk about and when you are done you will want to talk to someone about it!	2002-06-30

Quindlen writes about living in the moment, feeling happiness, finding the positive in your life, and appreciating what you have because it may be our last day on earth type of stuff. There was not one original \\"lesson\\" here. I have read this and heard it on TV shows over and over. There is nothing new here.<br />There are little stories intended to illustrate the point and to expand on how Quindlen arrived at her advice. The lessons are not \\"deep\\" either.  There were no stories that were remarkable and the worst was the story of the homeless man loving his life because he gets to sit on a pier and appreciate the view of the sea.<br />The title states this is a short guide: take that literally. Not only is the size of the page very small but there are many photos that take up a whole page and there are wide margins and lots of white space on each page. The entire book took me less than 10 minutes to read and I am not a speed-reader. The photographs don't bear any relation to the text at all and I couldn't figure out the logic of why these were chosen for the book. The subjects of the photos vary greatly in subject matter: lighthouses and seashores, people, etc. I think the photos could have been better chosen to somehow relate to what was being written about.<br />Perhaps this advice would be new to someone such as a high school graduate or for someone who has not yet realized that life is short and to enjoy the moment. I bet this was written as a little gift book to be given to teenagers or young adults, perhaps by an adult who feels the younger person wouldn't listen to their advice so better to convey it through an easy and fast read!<br />If you are a mother of young children in search of reminders to live life to the fullest and appreciate your children and your life now then I recommend \\"Mitten Strings for God\\". Another great book was written by a father to his 16 year old son with life advice is \\"Letters of a Businessman to His Son\\" which has great advice for both genders but makes a great gift book for high school graduates. Anything by Robert Fulghum also is fast and easy reading full of lessons about life.n to His Son\\" which has great advice for both genders but makes a great gift book for high school graduates.

A captivating story that I could not put down until finished.<br />This is the sad story of the life of a millionaire-family and their nanny who live in Manhattan. The father is an executive who rarely sees his son, a mother who bears children in order to keep her husband from divorcing her, and of a four-year-old boy who is starved of parental love. Nanny, the nanny, evolves into a doormat who won't say no, expanding her hours from part-time to 80 per week plus going on vacation with them-an act of martyrdom. Nanny does love the neglected boy but also has a history of repeating the \\"I can save the child\\" syndrome. The nanny is clearly the main caregiver and provider of love to this child, who is being pushed to attend way too many scheduled classes and sports sessions. As a mother of two young children my heart wept for this boy, born of monetary wealth but literally being neglected by his parents, being starved emotionally.<br />I don't want to ruin the story for you, so I won't go into detail about what happens. Suffice it to say the father is a workaholic and lacks \\"family values\\". Both father and mother place too much emphasis on buying expensive things while barely paying their hired help. The mother is cold and cruel and will do almost anything to keep her husband married to her. The nanny does not stand up for herself and tries her hardest to give the boy as much of a normal childhood as possible in the time she has with him.<br />I enjoyed reading this story; it was captivating and never boring! Reading this story helped remind me that my active participation in accepting full responsibility for raising my children is laudable and that a healthy marital relationship should not be taken for granted.	2002-06-22

I began using the recipes in this book when my son was three years old. Both children love the idea of picking something out of the book to do; it becomes an activity in itself looking over the pages while I talk about the recipes. The fun is first in making the thing and secondarily actually using it. I recommend that first the adult browse the book and stock up on some items from the craft store that you will need for the projects that you think you may do, for example, buying large quantities of salt, powered tempera paint, cornstarch, borax, and liquid starch. In the end you will end up with a product that costs less than the store bought version as well as having fun making the product. These projects are great for those rainy or hot days or when I want to engage the kids in something other than watching TV or me reading aloud to them.<br />Some of these things are homemade versions of commercial products. Examples are sidewalk chalk, sidewalk paint, a goo like Silly Putty  and another goopier goo that is like the store-bought slime. Homemade finger-paints of all different concoctions from pudding to soap based to gelatin based, and other paint type projects are included. There are many clays, from a simple dough to sand dough, to dough's made from edible products. There is even a recipe for school glue!<br />Some of the projects are more finished-product oriented such as a squishy-stress squeezing ball, grass head guy, crystal rock garden, a (musical instrument) rain stick, and a tornado in a bottle.<br />Young children will need the adult to do most of the reading, instruction following and major parts of the constructing process. I think this is balanced out with having young children (toddlers and preschool aged) help with stirring and measuring and then the fact that they are the ones playing with it in the end, is a good balance of work between the adult and the child.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough for all parents and grandparents.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough for all parents and grandparents.	2002-06-22

I want to make it clear that this is not just a book list of children's fiction. There are different books on the market that list only works of fiction. This book includes lists of books for these subjects: animals, art and architecture, bible/spiritual teaching, biography, crafts, hobbies, domestic arts, dance, drama, geography, history, horticulture, humor, language, literature (in several reading levels), poetry, rhymes, math, misc. music, outdoor activities other than group games, physical education, reference, science, technology, and special days and seasons.<br />This book was written by a homeschooler who is using the Charlotte Mason method. The Charlotte Mason method uses real books also known as living books, (not textbooks or boxed curriculum). This method allows the individual to use many different books written by people who are passionate about the subject to learn about a particular topic or unit of study. Living books are great books, books that capture the attention or imagination of the reader. Living books are not boring or uninspiring. I appreciate having this reference guide available to me, a pre-sorted list written by a user of the Charlotte Mason method, someone on the lookout for quality and inspiring books. It helps sift out the exceptional books from the unremarkable.<br /><br />OK so this was published in 1987 and any book list that is written poses the risk of immediately containing out of print books. The fact that this book is 14 years old (at the time I of this writing) adds to the possibility that some of these books will be out of print.  I see that other reviewers don't like book lists that contain out of print books. I appreciate a listing that contains out of print books, because besides shopping for new books, I also shop at local used book stores, online used book store and online out of print book stores. It is helpful to know about a great book and be on the lookout for that at a used bookstore (or by simply doing an online search for that title). As a homeschooling parent, our family library is growing and I do appreciate the ability to buy used books for sometimes as low as one or two dollars, and end up with better quality book than some currently-in-print, more expensive, new book.  Let's not also forget that our public libraries are full of out-of-print books, and that library used book sales are another source of finding great books that are out-of-print. In defense of the author, to further complicate matters books come in and out of print...one never knows when a previously out of print book will go back into circulation.<br />If you are looking for a book of children's fiction lists that deletes out of print books, see \\"The Read Aloud Handbook\\"-with each revision the author deletes the out of print books and only includes the in print books (at the time of the printing, of course).<br />I appreciate the detailed index, which allows easy scanning by title or author, something that not all book list-books include.<br />I found this interesting reading and went right through it, cover to cover, with pencil in hand to circle those that I thought our family would like to read.

I am not a bird expert; I am a homeschooling mother who is interested enough in birds to feed them and provide nesting boxes in our yard. I enjoy watching birds and this has lead to a curiosity about what they are doing and why.<br />This hardback version is wonderful and will grace our family library shelves for years. The paper stock is heavy and fine. There are beautiful and detailed watercolor illustrations and very detailed explanations of bird life and behavior. This book picks up where the bird identification books leave off and is more comprehensive than other books I have read about bird identification and behavior.<br />The index is easy to use for quick referencing about specific birds. There is loads of information here, probably everything youd want to know about birds. Amazon has over 50 sample pages for you to view, including the detailed table of contents, so I wont repeat that information inside of my review. The information is detailed but not intimidating for amateurs such as myself.<br />As a homeschooling mother this has already come in handy for discussions about the activities of our chimney swifts and Eastern Bluebirds that have taken up residence in our yard and home.<br />Even if you are an amateur birdwatcher, I encourage you to buy a bird identification book and then this book, rather than others on the market. Once you see this hefty volume and all the information it contains you will see the price is worth it! This is a reference volume that will be used for years.	2002-06-22

After reading many books and magazines about homeschooling, I still didn't quite understand how people spend the time during their day (until I read this book). This book is unique in that it explains so much of what I found missing in other books. At the time I read this book my oldest child was two years old and I planned to homeschool but still had a sense of vagueness about things such as: how much time do they actually spend teaching their child, or how much time the child works with a curriculum on their own. I wondered how many people use outside structured classes or how they actually manage to keep their house clean and how mom can serve up three meals per day?<br />Being a fan of the reality TV shows and biographical books, I like to see how people live and how they interact. I am curious about not only what a family chooses to do, but why, and how it is working out. I enjoyed the book because of the detail. I liked reading about why the family chose to homeschool and to what extent are they enjoying the experience. I also appreciated the comments about different teaching methods, books, and curriculum and which works for various children and why.<br />As I read these it seemed to me that many of the families discussed religion a lot. I went back and counted and found that is was a 50/50 split: half mention religion as being a daily part of their life and for some, the reason they homeschool, and the other half never mention it.<br />Most of the families' custom design their curriculum by choosing various curricula or by using non-textbook books. Some unschool and some use a school-in-a-box.<br />Some things I learned from reading this book was that there is no one right way to learn, no one right way to homeschool, and that flexibility is key. I also learned what I don't want to do as we homeschool (such as setting an alarm clock to wake up before my/our bodies are ready and to use a structured time schedule). I saw that some families self-imposed scheduling of formal learning really stressed them out, giving them a sense of despair if they didn't keep to their planned schedule. I also gleaned insight about how some families with four or more children actually live and homeschool: something that has always amazed me!<br />I think the author did a great job trying to capture a true day in the life of these families. It is clear she tried to represent religious homeschoolers, unschoolers, eclectic homeschoolers, etc. The number of children per family ranges from one to many. The role of the father is always mentioned. The location of the residences ranges from city to suburban to rural.<br />This was great fun to read and I did appreciate the details! The book also has a smallish font and little space in the margins: it is packed full! This book made me realize that although we may use the same books or curriculum, or may be unschooling, there is still no one way that each family moves through their day.<br />There is a sequel to this book that contains new families stories and a five-year follow up on some of the families featured in this book. It is called \\"Homeschool Open House\\" and is very similar to this book but is longer in page length and in the number of families represented.fore my/our bodies are ready and to use a structured time schedule).

US	51212167	R3NQ45EFH1X3GT	0156300001	88749355	Family Matters: Why Homeschooling Makes Sense	Books	5	124	125	N	N	Well though out opinions, makes great arguments	I've read a good number of books about homeschooling and was surprised and delighted to find this book discusses some topics I've not seen covered in other books. The jacket and chapter titles are not very clear about the content of the book so I will give an overview of what the book contains.<br />The introduction is one of the best pieces in the book! Guterson's theories on why American's hold public education so near and dear to their hearts, despite knowing the fallbacks and shortcomings. To ponder the notion of not sending our children to school is seen by many as un-American. Guterson feels we are unable to objectively examine schools for what they are because we are blinded by our memories.<br />Chapter one discusses standardized tests and in the end he states they are \\"unsound measurements of learning\\". School tests, quizzes, essays and assignments don't measure learning so much as they measure the child's \\"approximate degree of adjustment to life at school\\". Despite the many differences in homeschooling reason and method, the one central theme is the parent delivering an education that is custom designed to the child. Guterson states, \\"Teaching method and content in abstract are not relevant to academic success\\". This is refreshing because even amongst homeschoolers we usually encounter opinions of one teaching method or curriculum being superior to another.<br />Chapter two is a debate the author has with a father who does not support homeschooling and is a devout public school supporter. Debates about public schools as democracies, and the notion that homeschoolers should stay in schools and work to reform them and other topics are covered.<br />Chapter three discusses socialization and what it is that non-homeschoolers worry about regarding homeschooled children and socialization. Counter arguments are made for common misconceptions and the value that homeschooled children get from forming relationships with people of all ages throughout the community.  An interesting idea that schooled students are so far disconnected from their own parents and their parents work lives that some students seek a close relationship with a teacher, to form a relationship with an adult mentor since their own parents are away from them the majority of their lives. Guterson feels that the social lives of schooled children is both dangerous and unhealthy, and that homeschooled children do have peer pressure but are less peer obsessed.<br />Chapter four is a dialogue between the teacher and his students about homeschooling and why he homeschools. To answer the question about \\"is homeschooling legal and should it be\\" the author brings his father, an attorney, in to the class for a lecture on the topic. Of note is that his father is opposed to homeschooling but supports the freedom Americans have and should continue to have to homeschool their children if that is their desire.<br />Chapter five is a history of childhood and formal education, a good broad overview, albeit dry.<br />Chapter six delves into the educational philosophies of Plato, Rousseau, Dewey, and the child-centered learning enthusiasts: Steiner, Montessori, Neill, Pestaluzzi and Froebel (although all still advocate mass institutionalized schooling as the delivery method). Then Illich and Holt are reviewed as the philosophers who advocate that learning can take place outside of a school building. This chapter gives a good overview and if the reader wants to learn more, he can research these educational philosophers.<br />Chapter seven is a dialogue with an acquaintance that opposes homeschooling. This chapter focuses on the notion that in our modern day America, to maintain our lifestyle requires dual income families and therefore schools must be used as babysitters. There is no discussion here about successful homeschoolers of single income families or single parent families. Interesting dialogue about the role the Federal Government and private businesses affect parents'abilities to be available to care for and homeschool their children. The author feels the real educational problems are rooted in the breakdown of families but doesn't spend too much time on this subject (despite the title of the book).<br />Chapter eight discusses childhood and education and learning before formal schooling. Traditional peoples are discussed and looked to for information about how children learn what they need to know to live, learning various skills and values from different people in the community (rather than inside of a schoolhouse). Guterson states that in creating schools we've removed learning from life and believe that learning can only take place inside of a school building.<br />Chapter nine covers learning theory and the notation that educational psychology and learning theory were developed after schooling was created 150 years ago. Despite knowing this information, schools have not changed their ways, which is a scary thought. Discusses Skinner, Piaget, and Bruner as having important ideas about how education should be changed.<br />Chapter ten discusses educational reform. Guterson feels that educational reform should be through strengthening families. Ideas for ways to public schools and homeschoolers to work together as a team are explored.<br />Chapter eleven is a discourse about what it is like for a homeschooling parent to be grilled by non-homeschoolers about the why's and wherefores of homeschooling. A rant about people assuming the father doesn't play a part in the education of the children is in this chapter along with a discussion of the men's movement. Guterson reminds us that parents have always been teachers and that it is only recently that teaching has become a salaried profession. Discussions about parents that can't wait for summer vacation to end so they can be rid of spending time with their children and about sports as the only link between disconnected fathers and schooled children is reviewed.<br />These are the meaty topics that are discussed in detail in this book. As I stated earlier, it is not a dry volume, it is quick to get to the point and studies and examples are given when appropriate.

I found that Plains of Passage (4th book) began to be more about anthropology and history than story line. This 5th book has the same problem. I was waiting anxiously, for about 10 years, for this book to be published and ran out to buy it in its' first week of publication. Reading the introduction, I realized the author has spent many years researching the anthropology and sociology and history and that is to be commended. It seems apparent that she jumped through many hoops to be accurate and informative in her writings. Unfortunately I felt the story was a bit lost in the details of the factual writings. (I feel sad writing anything negative about this book though, as I do love the series and appreciate Jean Auel's hard work and dedication to \\"getting the information correct\\".)<br />Despite my love of this series and of the characters, I found it hard to be captivated by this book. With her previous writings (especially the first two), I stayed up very late at night because I just could not put the book down. That didn't happen with this novel, I am sad to admit.<br />There were too many facts, more detail than I ever care to know about. Yes, I am interested in the ways of life way back then, but I don't care to hear of such detail about how a food storage bin made of rocks is constructed-to me, that is boring. I guess I am a visual person and many times in this series I have wished for small line drawings on the sides of the page to illustrate some things such as the spear-thrower, a hide being stretched out, or the weaving loom, or the appearance of an herb used for medicinal purposes. I want more story and plot and emotions than information about their lifestyle.<br />Just when I was curious about what would happen next, there was too much detail about things. For example, just taking a walk to take a bath ends up being a lesson in biology of plant life. I kept thinking, \\"get back to the story\\" and \\"for goodness sake, just take a bath\\". Another example is that near the end when Ayla is very close to going into labor (to give birth) they are talking about how to make a knife blade. At that point with less than 40 pages to go I'd had enough of the academics and wanted her to have the baby, for goodness sake!<br />In the beginning of the book the days drag through, one day's time spans many pages. With the business of the story in those first days, added in with the factual information, it was too much. Then at other times of the story they suddenly zoom by in number of weeks or months.<br />I would have preferred more story and more emotions. There were many times when I felt Ayla should have had stronger emotions and they were not written about. There were also some occurrences that I thought could have been played out in more detail or picked up later in the story, although perhaps that will happen in the next (and last) novel. For the diehard fans of the Earth's Children series, I think we'll read the book (despite any negative reviews) and cherish the book anyway, (reminding ourselves it is still superior to most fiction out there). The fans will anticipate the last installment of the series, and to see how Ayla makes out in her next phase of life.being a lesson in biology of plant life.

As I read the story I thought it was leading to something different than what is was. This story could be so much better.<br />First, the attitude in the beginning is all-or-nothing. The hired piano teacher is nasty to the young boy and calls him hopeless. Both illustrations of her show a frowning face.  She is impatient with the boy and bangs the keys. Frankly if a piano teacher used such negative comments and was so miserable with my children I'd fire her. The boy thinks he is a failure at learning the piano and at first no one else tries to convince him otherwise (such as his mother or father-where are the parents in this book?). The boy loves baseball and has tunnel vision and wants to excel at baseball and quit playing the piano. The one appearance of the mother is when the boy asks to please quit piano lessons and she says \\"we don't have quitters in this family\\". I dislike the use of name calling here and don't understand why this mother pays a nasty teacher to verbally abuse the boy and why she insists on forcing him to continue with the piano lessons (or at least try a different teacher). Why can't a person be good at two things? Why is the family discouraging the baseball at times and pushing the piano when he isn't interested?<br />I very much disliked the use of the word stupid as an adjective as in \\"but I get an urge to sit down at the stupid piano\\". I am trying to teach my children to use the word appropriately and not as a derogatory adjective so I disapprove of the authors use of the word stupid in this children's book.<br />The boy cites his grandmother as a positive role model and that she is the only one who understands him. But when the boy complains that he doesn't have the talent to learn to play the piano it states the grandmother was silent. In other cases the boy puts himself down verbally and the grandmother does not refute his statements, which I thought was sad. I was hoping for some words of encouragement! Later on she does encourage him and give him honest feedback, thank goodness (but I'd rather have seen that consistent throughout the story). Despite my negative criticism, the good part of this story is of the close relationship between grandson and grandmother.<br />I am disappointed at the complete lack of presence of the boy's father and mother. Why don't the parents take care of (one of their) mothers? Why is a young boy sent to care for the grandmother and we never see the parent ever speaking to the grandmother? I like stories where the entire family unit is portrayed in a more harmonious manner.<br />In the end he is playing better and says his piano teacher is now his grandmother. They appear to have a close relationship and I think that is wonderful. Also in the end he is playing piano and playing baseball, when previously he didn't think he could do both things. I wished the book somehow stated more directly that it is possible to do well at two very different things and that with practice and the desire, one can learn and improve skills such as piano playing.<br />Lastly, I do like to see a rare instance where a children's book demonstrates that a family member can be a better teacher and the preferred teacher, than professional teachers.!

US	51212167	RYJLR2TUKQWVA	0789434369	47212964	Big Book Of Trains	Books	2	209	219	N	N	a big disappointment	Although I am a huge fan of DK books, and my two boys are huge train fans, this book was a big disappointment. Our family owns many train books for children and I am sorry to rate this the poorest of the lot. I feel this is too high of a price for this book.<br />The title says it is a big book but what that means is the page size is large and the photos are huge. The huge page size makes it hard to hold up to read aloud to, it works best to lie it flat on the floor or the bed and sit beside it to read it aloud. Many of these photos are published in other/better DK or Eyewitness published books on the subject of trains and railroads (see below) so if you own those books already then this one will be a repeat. (Also note that the DK board book on trains has some of these same exact photos in it.) Many times the photos are gigantic, covering one entire page-and they are ineffective. For example, why would we want to see this huge ½ of the front of a diesel engine? I'd prefer to use the large size of the book and/or the fold out pages to show the full length of the engine (rather than parts of one car) and to show the tender (if applicable) or perhaps use the long page length to show a full train of many cars that are all coupled up to each other.<br />There is not a lot of text to go with the photo spreads, the font size is rather large. In other words, there is not a lot of text to go with the photos; there are simply large font words with gigantic and large photos. Also note that this book is 32 pages long, so this is not a big book in the sense of containing many pages. Some of the pages fold out for really long and large pages but since these are regular paper stock, our copy quickly was bent and a mess. I feel that any children's book with fold out pages, for the age range of 4-8 should be constructed of heavier stock paper so it will last longer.<br />I highly recommend meatier books rather than this one, such as DKs \\"See and Explore Trains and Railways\\" and \\"Eyewitness: Train\\". \\"Eyewitness Train\\"... is 64 pages long, has more illustrations and more text. It is a bargain to get so much more in a book that is only a [little] more than DK's Big Book of Trains. Although the publisher states this is for ages 8-12, my two-year old son loves this book and I can partially read aloud from the pages until he wants to turn to another page. I find these books for older children are definitely enjoyed by the younger children. Not only do they contain more text but they contain more images. I also enjoy these more comprehensive books as I can read them myself to learn about the trains and I am prepared to answer the many different questions that my children ask me to answer. It is nice to have these more comprehensive books that are not \\"dumbed down\\" and that the children can grow into.Eyewitness: Train\\". \\"Eyewitness Train\\"... is 64 pages long, has more illustrations and more text.

US	51212167	R34AZ2H56BS8CE	0310263816	762286133	Honey for a Child's Heart	Books	4	194	197	N	Y	Family focused book about the value of reading	In this book, the author writes about what makes a book a good book and why reading to oneself and why reading aloud is important and then provides a long bibliography of recommended books. What makes this book special and different from other books  (i.e. \\"Read Aloud Handbook\\") is that this book is completely family focused. It is written for an intended audience of parents and stresses using reading as an important activity that bonds families together.<br />Hunt feels that good books feed the soul, teach values, and build character. When one connects with a character emotionally, lessons will naturally be learned from reading the story and getting to know and love the characters. Only good books fit the bill for nourishing the soul, only good books provide \\"honey\\". Hunt quotes Eric Fromm, who wrote that he feels that children need \\"milk\\" and \\"honey\\" to thrive: the milk is the parent providing for the child's physical needs, and the \\"honey\\" is the \\"sweetness of life, that special quality that gives the sparkle within a person\\".  Hunt and Fromm agree that only a minority of children are receiving \\"honey\\" from their parents, a parent must first love honey and have it to give, and that not every parent has it to give. Hunt feels that \\"good books are rich in honey\\".<br />There are 124 pages of discussion about good books and the value of selecting good books. Good books make children wonder, laugh, and that contains spiritual, emotional, and intellectual dimensions. There is not much dedicated to selecting books for toddlers and preschoolers although there are plenty of books for that age range in the book list. Unlike other books, this is purely opinion and the author does not spend time discussing results from studies about reading aloud. This book does not discuss issues such as problems that schools have with teaching reading or dealing with children who are not read to, or discussing problems with illiterate children and adults, or other societal educational matters-this book is focused on the family unit and speaks to parents about using reading and books to enrich the lives of their children.<br />Not a lot of time is spent talking about what makes a bad book, and specific examples are not given of bad books. I was a bit disappointed that the issue of guns and violence in books for preschoolers was not mentioned. Hunt does discuss negative content in books for upper elementary grades and teens. Hunt states it is a bad idea to fashion stories around common life problems for the sake of dosing up the books with realism: no matter how sad or pointless it is. To inject these negative issues in a manner that leaves the reader feeling sad and hopeless accomplishes nothing positive, and only serves to squash the child's spirit. Hunt states that it is now common for books to feature rape, sexual problems, and illicit drug and alcohol use.<br />Hunt is Christian and evidence of this is speckled here and there but I don't think it will be offensive to non-Christians. There are 12 pages dedicated to a chapter about reading aloud from the Bible as a daily family experience.<br />This edition contains 85 pages of book lists. The books are first divided into three age ranges, then by type such as picture book or series. From there the books are arranged by complexity of content, and then alpha by author. There is an index by author name only. Trying to look up a single book title to see if Hunt recommends it is not possible. Some of the entries contain no description, most contain one sentence description, and some contain 2 or 3 sentences for a description. This book lists contain works of fiction, not non-fiction such as books about trains or other \\"real\\" things that young children do love to read about-there are plenty of other ways to find those books, though.<br />I loved that Hunt brings into the discussion, the role of family and creating a safe and comfortable home for the child. There is a chapter about influences in the child's life: good and bad. Television is discussed, very lightly, for its problems such as helping contribute to short attention spans in preschool aged children, squelching creativity, and that the violent content of many shows and evening news programs does nothing but corrupt the soul. Good books are often translated into movies (Disney and such) but rarely compare to the quality and depth as the story as told in the book version. Hunt basically cautions to selectively watch TV but to make sure children get a daily dose of reading good books rather than spending valuable time sitting in front of poor content television shows and commercials. There are other books on the market that cite the studies and discuss the problems with television such as \\"Endangered Minds\\", if that is something you are interested in learning more about.<br />I love that Hunt is writing about the importance of family life and the value of reading as a family bonding experience, rather than the more common urging of parents to read anything at all to their children just so they would be interested in reading when the time comes to teach them to read. I am sick of hearing that parents should read anything, anything at all, to their children as a way to interest them in reading-I believe that content does matter!<br />Hunt's analysis of what constitutes a good book and her urging to use books to elevate the child's spirit is refreshing to read about. Hunt writes with clarity and this book is quick read but the important message will stay with you and inspire you. This book would make a great gift for new parents or grandparents; it makes an easy \\"wish list\\" to use as a buying guide. The price of this book is inexpensive and will save you time searching for good books in the library or bookstores, and it will save you money when you are buying books so I recommend it for every parent and grandparent.'s life: good and bad.

This is definitely written for people who've already researched it and are now making up their own curriculum. The book lists books and curriculum that Ms. Berquist recommends for all subjects, organized in a per grade level format. It is well written, easy to follow, and makes designing your own curriculum seem not only possible but easy. The author inputs her personal opinions about various books and curriculum, stating what has worked for her and what did not; the majority of the content is a description of what did work for her. I love reading homeschooling parent's opinions of what worked, what didn't and why; I learn more from their opinions than from reading marketing materials that the companies write.<br />The listings of books and curriculum is limited to just what Berquist personally used. For example, one math curriculum company seems to be used throughout all the grade levels. If this book were truly for someone to design their own curriculum, I would think that if they tried Ms. Berquist's recommended math curriculum and the family did not like it, that they would need some help and guidance to find a different curriculum. The book would live up to its title if it contained a variety of different curriculum company options with Ms. Berquist's opinions of the pro's and con's of each. In this case the reader would have to turn to other sources to find ideas for books or curriculum that may fit their own custom-designed curriculum for their child. (However, that is the beauty of designing your own curriculum, that no two programs will be identical, right?)  For anyone looking for that type of review, for additional information, I suggest two (non-religious) books: Rebecca Rupp's The Complete Home Learning Source Book. Or for less curriculum but more books and materials that you can truly custom-create your own curriculum, I suggest The Home School Source Book by Jean and Donn Reed. (These two books are different from each other and are not duplicates in any way.)<br />Each recommended book and curriculum is footnoted with a source. This is nice yet it is unavoidable that companies change their inventory constantly. I found that some of the recommended books were unavailable at the recommended sources when I attempted to buy them. The author didn't include ISBN numbers for the recommended books, and I had trouble finding the books doing a general book search without the ISBN (for example, many books are called \\"children's bible\\" and no author name was listed for that volume). Lastly, Internet Website addresses were not given for any of the sources although many of the companies do have a Website. I used a search engine to track down the websites with success.<br />I think the strongest area is Berquist's detailed recommendations for quality teaching materials for the subject of Catholicism. The religion curriculum is very detailed: more detailed than other subjects and I found it very helpful. I feel that some of her recommended courses of study are weak, such as using the game \\"Mommy, it's a Renoir\\" to teach art spanning several grade levels.<br />Two homeschooling mothers that I know who read \\"The Well Trained Mind\\" (TWTM) first and wanted to design their own Catholic Classical Education program for their children said they felt this book was invaluable and both recommended that I read this book. They found it easy to read, felt that it had good resource listings, and said it helped quelch a bit of fear about what they perceived was an overwhelming task after reading TWTM: to custom design a classical education for their own children.<br />This is definitely worth reading if you are starting out homeschooling with the intent to design your own classical curriculum, which includes teaching Catholicism to your children. You may not choose to duplicate Berquist'sprogram 100%, but you will find many good recommendations, good source lists to obtain catalogs from, and will be inspired and will feel that you are capable of designing your own curriculum plan!t's program 100%, but you will find many good recommendations, good source lists to obtain catalogs from, and will be inspired and will feel that you are capable of designing your own curriculum plan!	2002-04-05
US	51212167	R35D507K4SL3J8	0937750123	509781612	Don Aslett's Clutter-Free!: Finally & Forever	Books	5	73	73	N	N	Hilarious and inspiring!	I have several books on simplifying life and organizing the home. I have found the organizing books patronizing and useless. Organization books helped me organize some of my stuff but not get rid of anything. I never really organized everything because to do so was too daunting of a task as I had too much stuff.<br />This is the first Don Aslett book I've read. Especially in the beginning, it is something like 95% reader's stories of their clutter and junk. It is laugh-out-loud funny. These stories are so extreme that I had to stop reading and immediately started going through my own things and getting rid of stuff. I'd go back and read more and then go back to de-cluttering. It took me 6 weeks to read the book because I have spent hours and hours de-junking my house in between. There are also some funny quizzes and poems, those that didn't interest me I simply skipped over.<br />The overall approach with this book is that it presents many readers's stories of what they save and collect and how they got rid of some of it. Then Aslett chimes in with his two cents and sometimes some tips on how to decide whether to save something or keep it or other words of wisdom regarding the subject at hand. Then back to this format over and over. I actually loved the format and felt that it was not preachy in nature. It was also easy to read in small bits and pieces, something nice for a busy mother like myself.<br />Aslett focuses on getting rid of most everything that we are not currently using or using within the last year. While I can't get that radical, it is inspirational. He deems a \\"collection\\" as anything we have three or more of, and he recommends having no collections. When I started thinking of it that way, I realized that I had some true garbage items that Aslett considers a collection, so I got rid of some of it! \\"Getting rid of\\" can mean giving things away to charities or friends, doing a tag sale, or throwing out the true trash. As I was de-junking I found some things he stated to be true: that some of the things I'd been saving had broken some time while in storage, some things attracted mice and were chewed, newspaper clippings were so yellowed that they were unreadable, and some books so mildew-y smelling that I got a headache when trying to read them. After experiencing that I realized Aslett was right when he said that even the stuff we save is usually useless (or lost) by the time we get around to trying to use it so we are better off to get rid of it sooner than later and not even to store it at all.<br />There are some very common-sense and useful tidbits such as the discussion of \\"is having a tag sale really worth the time, effort, etc.\\" to which the answer is \\"no\\". I agree with him that selling used clothing to a consignment shop or at a tag sale is also less \\"profitable\\" than donating it to a charity and taking a tax deduction. The part about saving empty containers (boxes, tins, etc.) hit home and is true, how silly is it to save empty containers! The part about saving newspapers until we have time to read them is hilarious and I had to share that with some of my relatives who are guilty of this never-ending project of catching up on old newspapers.<br />I do feel a sense of more freedom now, as Aslett tells us we will feel if we de-junk. I also feel that my things do not bog me down. I have more de-junking to go but I am actually enjoying it! I also love living in the spaces that I've streamlined and de-junked, I can put my hands right on things when I need them, no searching through piles, etc.<br />I highly recommend this book. A relative and have two others waiting to borrow it next. Just talking to my friends and relatives about my own de-junking has inspired four people to start their own journey, and they haven't even read the book yet. Actually I am considering giving the Aslett books as gifts in the future!<br />Addendum: I am now reading \\"Clutter's Last Stand\\" and \\"Lose 200 lbs...\\" and I find that bothof those have harsher attitudes and sometimes actually are a bit demeaning and insulting toward people who have clutter. This book though, had none of that attitude and is by far much funnier and contains more reader mail which is fun to read.of those have harsher attitudes and sometimes actually are a bit demeaning and insulting toward people who have clutter.

There are 75 \\"reusable\\" stickers showing cartoon-like trains. There are all different trains, coaches, box cars, diesel engines, subways, steam engines, etc. The text is vague so the child can use their imagination and their own creativity to create their own trains and I think that is great. There are lots of different scenes that the children then paste the train cars onto the rails.<br />My complaint is that these stickers are not really re-usable. Even when we tried removing a sticker within minutes of putting it on the page it curled up onto itself, got all stuck, and had to be thrown away. Other times when we tried to re-stick it to the paper, it simply would not stick fully and peeled up by itself and made a mess. I really resent the marketing of these so-called reusable stickers (by this company and other publishers) when really they are not reusable. Also my 4 year-old son got very frustrated with them rolling up and getting ruined when he did not cause the problem! He wanted me to \\"fix it\\" but I simply could not.<br />Once the stickers are in place the book can be re-read and browsed as a completed book which is great.<br />Overall my children have played with this enough to have gotten good use of the 75 stickers for the low price... so I am granting it a 3 star rating. Other books with similar issues charge a much higher price and/or don't allow as much creativity as this book. This would make an excellent project for long car trips or air flights.	2002-02-23

Overall the tone of the book is very serious. This is not a fast read by any means. It is not difficult to understand but I found that I was savoring the words and reading it slowly. Some of Andreola's statements were so profound that they made me stop to ponder the ideas. At the end of each chapter is a listing of questions for further thought or discussion. These would be great to use for group discussion such as at a homeschooling support group meeting.<br />Andreola is very interested in the Charlotte Mason method and her passion for the method comes through clearly. She is very thorough in her discussions about ways to put into practice Ms. Mason's theories. One of my favorite things about this book is that first and foremost it focuses on the importance of a happy and healthy home and family life for raising children. The backbone here is teaching the children respect, values, and virtues. Once those foundations are in place then it is time for introducing \\"school subjects\\".<br />All the components of the over 100-year-old Charlotte Mason method of homeschooling is here: using living books instead of textbooks, using narration instead of testing, teaching reading, writing, music, nature study, poetry, history and music. This book is so well written. It is not a quick read manual of how to implement the Charlotte Mason method; it is a well-thought out series of essays and personal reflections. Many times while reading the book I wanted to highlight passages and makes notes in the borders. This is a book to buy and keep for future reference. Even if you are homeschooling with Charlotte Mason's method as an inspiration this book is useful. The book heavily refers to Christianity but if that is not your belief system I feel you can still apply everything to your homeschooling, just ignore the references to Christianity.<br />Andreola repeatedly states that she didn't intend this book to be a replacement of Charlotte Mason's original books and she urges the reader to go on to read Mason's books as well. I think Andreola's book is a great introduction and if you want more then go on to read Mason's works.<br />Addendum: This addendum is being written 18 months after my original review was posted. Even after reading this book I felt a little confused about the day to day planning of how to homeschool with this method. This missing link was bridged by attending a workshop given by another author/homeschooling parent named Catherine Levison, which was an oral presentation of the information presented her book called \\"More Charlotte Mason Education\\". If you want a quick read that focuses on the bare bones of how to do the Charlotte Mason method (not theory) then I suggest reading \\"More Charlotte Mason Education\\".<br />If you are looking for a faster read about the theory of Charlotte Mason education then I'd recommend either Catherine Levison's \\"A Charlotte Mason Education\\" or Susan Schaeffer Macaulay's \\"For the Children's Sake\\". Andreola's book \\"A Charlotte Mason Companion\\" is wonderful reading when you have the time and desire to ponder over her thought-provoking passages.<br />I am now in a book discussion group where we are reading Andreola's \\"A Charlotte Mason Companion\\" together and discussing it. We read the sections aloud and stop to discuss our thoughts, and when the chapter is finished, we discuss the questions that Andreola provides at the end of every chapter.

Different emotions that can occur when dealing with different people are expressed. The text then talks about how we feel about our own emotions and then how we have the choice as to how to react to our emotions and then how we then communicate back to the people who have done us wrong. The text is great, the messages are wonderful, and there is a lot to talk about, such as &quot;I am in charge of my words and actions...they belong to me&quot;.  What is mentioned is in general, getting along, feeling good when things go well, fighting, arguing, yelling, hitting, crying, taking turns, sharing, solving problems, and treating others well. More themes covered are name calling, physically hurting others, bullying, how friends should act with one another, and despite physical appearance differences, we are all the same inside with the same emotions and are deserving of respect from one another.<br />The thing I don't like about this book is that it is written in the first-person narrative but the book does not have a main character so it doesn't quite make sense when being read aloud. The sentences have statements such as &quot;I don't like mean words&quot; and &quot;But I can choose not to do that&quot;. There is no main character in the book, either mentioned in text or in illustration. Every page has different illustrations of all different children. The text makes more sense if the child is reading it to themselves. This really irks me! The storyline just doesn't make sense to me without using a main character of some kind or at least referencing them by having a main character on every page's illustration to show whom the author is talking about.<br />I also like how the illustrations have one theme per page. Every child's favorite subject is sure to be covered on one of the pages: dinosaurs, trains, princesses, firefighters, etc.<br />Lastly, my favorite thing about this book is that it is written intelligently with respect that young children have control over their actions and intentions and can choose to act responsibly. I salute the author for acknowledging that young children are capable individuals who can make good choices independently.t that young children have control over their actions and intentions and can choose to act responsibly.

This 600+ page book may seem daunting but it is not hard to read and you can pick and choose the chapters that you are interested in and that apply to your situation. It is also easy to skim for basic information at first and then if you need to delve into detail you can go back and read each word and section that applies to you.<br />Black and white photographs, paragraphical text, case studies, and lists are the ways that Rapp describes the various maladies that are caused by brain allergies. There are easy to reference lists and separate chapters on how allergies manifest in infants, toddlers, children, and adolescents.<br />After the discussion of the allergy symptoms Rapp moves on to how to detect the food culprit and how to confirm via testing with provocation/neutralization (P/N) testing. This testing entails a pinprick for up to 40 times in one session PER FOOD, administered by the physician. Rapp discusses the single and multiple food elimination diet, and the rotary diet. She gives you all the information you need to know to implement these plans but advises you seek the council of a physician. Rapp explains that she prepares a diluted solution of allergy extract serum that the parent can administer to the child to reduce the affect of the allergic reaction (mixed up by the doctor and sold to the patient).  Rapp also gives instructions for using an alkali nonprescription item to stop the allergic reaction once it has begun.<br />Hypoglycemia is also discussed briefly and how sometimes the patient may have hypoglycemia-only, allergies-only, or both hypoglycemia and allergies together. Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) is also discussed because sometimes the underlying problem is an allergy that causes the GER or it is just an allergy showing itself with similar symptoms as GER.  Rapp states that the person with the food allergy often becomes addicted to that food and it is probably apparent to the parent just from watching the child, what they are allergic to and eliminating that food is a good and easy place to start. Rapp gives ideas for record keeping while the detective work is going on.<br />Hyperactivity, ADD, ADHD, and Ritalin is actually necessary take up several chapters. More chapters on aggression, &quot;slow&quot; children, delinquency, and fatigue, headaches and seizures round out more links to allergy as the root cause. If you treat the allergy then these symptoms sometimes go away.<br />Now for our family's story. When my son was two years old, over a nine-month period, he very gradually began changing behaviors and showing some physical signs that I thought was strange. Visits to our pediatrician did not yield any answers and I was told that these behaviors were &quot;the terrible two's&quot; but I knew that my son was acting differently than he ever did before. I cut way down on TV viewing because of his zombie-like behavior and moodiness but that didn't help. My son was a picky eater who ate only a few foods. I never suspected food allergy. My son was getting very hard to live with and his overall personality was quite changed, gloomy and depressed-acting.  I was on an email chat list where a parent asked for help with some behaviors her child was exhibiting and they were the same as my son so I was curious to see what parenting tips the other mothers would come up with. Someone replied to read this book and that it sounds like the child had food allergies. I was shocked at that idea, but was desperate and read the book. I was glued to the book and stayed up late into the night reading it and was shocked that all the different behaviors and physical symptoms were listed in the book. I burst into tears to think my son had food allergies and dreaded the chore of living with eliminating foods from his diet. I did the elimination diet with dairy and his symptoms all disappeared within 48 hours! My pediatrician and the pediatricallergist we visited did not believe in these allergies despite my showing them this book, discussing the success with the elimination diet, and a physical exam. Since we had done the food elimination diet and had success, I knew that we were right and those doctors were wrong. My cynical husband was even convinced. We finally found a doctor (not in our insurance plan) that does believe in these allergies and he confirmed what I already knew. However, and this is the important part: he said new technology has come out since this book was written. My son did not have to go through the P/N testing (all those pinpricks) to get a diagnosis. We simply had his blood drawn (one vial) and sent it off to Immuno Laboratories for IgG testing for a panel of over 100 foods. The test and the information the lab provided was excellent and my son was diagnosed with 23 food allergies. That was just over a year ago. Actually living with the food elimination is not that difficult (unless you do a lot of restaurant eating or traveling). Living with a healthy and happy, well-behaved child again is worth any amount of food substitution and food elimination on our part. Our physician does not believe in giving the child extracts to counteract the allergic reaction, but believes in a total food elimination diet so the body can heal itself and get over the allergy. These allergies are usually outgrown over time. I am so thankful for finding this book and this information.<br />If your child is having any negative behaviors, acting differently than they used to,  or showing signs of hyperactivity, aggression or ADD/ADHD, I feel it is worth your time and effort to read this book and investigate food allergies before you simply accept a different diagnosis or label the behaviors as &quot;normal for that age&quot;.tric allergist we visited did not believe in these allergies despite my showing them this book, discussing the success with the elimination diet, and a physical exam.

Easy to understand information is given about the life cycle of the butterfly with photographs of every stage. How to raise butterflies in various ways, even how to catch butterflies in the wild and help them mate are given in such easy to follow methods that Mikula has me believing I can do this!

The author acknowledges both stay at home mothers and employed mothers without entering the &quot;Mommy Wars&quot; or even getting into a discussion of what she thinks is best (because she recognizes that what is best for each person is different and unique to that individual). The role of mother is have is not always an easy one. The difficulties, pressures, and stressors of the modern mother are outlined including some historical information about the role of the mother and technological changes regarding housework over the last couple of hundred years. The author contends that each of us is in control of our lives and how we choose to react to these stressors is up to us. By becoming aware of the various things that can make our lives miserable, we can pick and choose which things we want to do or not do or how we react to things, so that life is manageable for us and we can lead happy lives. The author explains that if stress builds up burnout and depression can occur.<br />This book is not negative in tone. It provides good information to orient the mother as to why there is good reason for feeling overwhelmed with all that she has to do. I have not read any book on this subject that has this focus, this unique attitude of holding motherhood as an important role and providing ideas for how mother can remain sane and happy in her role. This is not like some books that basically have the tone that as a stay at home mother we should feel privileged and not have anything to complain about. The author also does not blame the mother for lifestyle choices she makes and then saying it is her fault. This book applies to all mothers, not just mothers of babies. The author is not judgmental about parenting choices and as an example, portrays breastfeeding in a positive light and mentions cosleeping as fine if that is what works best for your family.<br /><br />Here is a listing of what is covered in the order of the chapters: stress, what it is; depression, recognizing it, how to get treatment, treatment options; burnout, what it is, recognizing it, how to avoid it. History of the housewife in America, how we arrived where we're at, are our jobs easier now that we have modern appliances? Working outside the home, why mothers might want to combine work and motherhood, making it manageable, making the decision to work.  How to lightening housework to a manageable level, sharing duties with spouse and children, organizing the household so it runs smoothly. Sleep deprivation, what it is and how it affects our bodies and mental state. Adult survivors of childhood abuse: physical, verbal, sexual and how it affects the parent, including how it may affect breastfeeding and general mothering issues. The added stress of living with a &quot;spirited&quot; child (such as ADD/ADHD), the special stress of living with a child with medical problems. Dealing with miscarriage, stillbirth, or death of infant, the effects these have on the mother (even if society doesn't fully recognize this type of mourning or stress). The Epilogue gives hope for the future and tips for making things best for you as an individual.<br />Each chapter has an extensive listing of books and some websites on the various subjects covered in that chapter. The book appears well researched with a long reference research list. Overall it is very easy to read and interesting. It has helped me not feel as guilty for feeling overwhelmed at times. I think every mother would gain something from reading this. It is nice to see that someone realizes how hard the job of mothering is and understands that the role can cause stress, burnout and even depression in even the most capable and intelligent woman.what works best for your family.<BR> <BR>Here is a listing of what is covered in the order of the chapters: stress, what it is; depression, recognizing it, how to get treatment, treatment options; burnout, what it is, recognizing it, how to avoid it.

The title says it all but the back cover also gives a great summary (which you can view right here on Amazon). The pages are covered with ideas for what hands are to be used for (playing, working together) and then each page has numerous illustrating examples (building snowpeople, sandcastle, block tower, etc.). Over and over we hear that hands are not for hitting but they are for doing many positive things.<br />I am a homeschooling parent of a four-year-old who at times hits others. Our biggest problem though is bullying being done to him by others. I bought this to read to him as a reminder because for a while he was learning more from imitating his peers (hitting back) than listening to what his father and I were verbally teaching him. I figured having this book around the house could not hurt. My son likes to browse it himself and look at the pictures and I read it aloud from time to time. I don't read it a lot because since he rarely hits it is a little annoying to keep telling him something he already knows. However, this is published by a publisher focusing on books for teachers and schools. I think the best way this book could be used would be to read it aloud to groups of children because there is bound to be a child in attendance who may need a reminder. This would also be a great book for public libraries to have in their collection for parents to borrow.<br />The illustrations are cute and brightly colored. At the back of the book is a note to grown-ups about teaching non-violence to children. There are approximately 4 pages that list out additional activities and discussion questions to go along with each page of the book. There is also a listing of books that expand on various subjects touched on throughout this book. I can't think of any way that I'd improve upon it. Overall a great book on this important subject!t!	2001-12-31

A must-read for all parents.<br />The premise of the book is that children need a strong connection with their parents in order to have good self-esteem, self-confidence, happiness and good behavior. The author is a play therapist that feels that the key to getting and staying connected with our children aged three through the teen years is through play. If you think your child has great behavior then following the ideas in this book will still help foster close connections and reduce the minor issues such as whining, begging, etc. The author contends that simply by spending time playing with our children with the child in control of the nature of the play, that a strong connection can be made. Specific ideas for play &quot;tactics&quot; are given when the parent wants to solve some particular problem or fear.<br />The gist of the book is that at about age 3 and up children are in the play mode, they like to play, want to play, need to play. They also at this time live in a world where they feel powerless or isolated at least some of the time, even in the best family situations. The theory is that they have &quot;cups&quot; that fill with love and sometimes when feeling isolated or powerless the cups run low and need refilling. When the cup is low the negative behaviors begin. The author feels that at these ages 3 through teen years, the fastest and most effective way to fill the love cup is by playing with your children. Most of his examples are with the work he has done with his child and his patients. He tells of certain games that can be played to overcome<br />this or that, such as how to deal with the child who wants to play guns and shoot at the parent, how to deal with swearing, what to do when the child is hyper and aggressive, etc. He made this seem so very simple that I didn't believe it would work. I also at first, didn't want to think my own children would ever need this. But I started using it immediately with my 4<br />YO and it DOES WORK.<br />The author discusses the negative issues of permissiveness and the negative aspects of the opposite extreme of over-strictness/authoritarian style of discipline. Regarding punishment methods, the author also is against yelling, threatening, or using verbal abusive techniques such as shaming as well as physical methods such as hitting in any way or spanking. He is also against using time-outs for punishment and explains why they don't work but instead foster more feelings of isolation and detachment. He discusses why letting a baby &quot;cry it out&quot; should not be done. The author is also against behavior modification tactics such as rewards and bribes, giving a brief overview of why they fail in the end, then he suggests reading &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; for more detailed information.<br />The author is supportive of attachment in infancy and continuing throughout the teen years. The author interestingly enough never mentions actions to be taken in infancy that would secure an attachment. If you are looking for ways to foster this attachment in your birth through two year old I would recommend books on the subject of attachment parenting such as &quot;The Baby Book&quot; or &quot;The Discipline Book&quot;, both written by William Sears MD and his wife Martha Sears RN. However, &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; expands on the information outlined by the Sears' and this book gives more tools and techniques while the essence of this book flows seamlessly from the philosophy as the Sears'.<br />Unlike other parenting book author &quot;experts&quot;, Cohen is able to give the special perspective of a psychologist and really gives some useful information, psychological-wise, on the importance of fostering a close connection with our children and how and why these exercises (play therapy) can and does work. Cohen does not use psychological terminology and the writing style is easy for parents to read and understand. While some other parenting books identify certain behaviors as &quot;normal&quot; for this age or that age, Cohen cites these behaviors as signals that the child is in need of some attention (via play) and once given, the behavior stops. (I recently read a parenting book by psychologists that simply listed multiple negative behaviors as normal for that age. I prefer Cohen's book because he cites the reason for it and suggests solutions.)<br /><br />He talks about power struggles and about parents who don't like to play,<br />that are serious all the time or preoccupied and begs parents to loosen up<br />and play with the kids.<br />Near the end of the book he does discuss individual issues of importance<br />such dealing with children's sex play, sibling rivalry, gun play, etc.<br />Lastly, I'd like to add that Cohen admits throughout the book that as a parent he is not perfect and that he even has to sometimes push himself to get down and play Barbie games with his daughter. He does not write with a holier-than-thou attitude. I've done a lot of reading about parenting but have never read anything as great as Cohen's theory and ideas for parenting the three-plus year old.tand.

I found this book captivating and could not put it down. It is a quick and easy read although its' contents will keep you thinking for a long time.<br />The author begins with his first day of school and takes us through the end of the school year at which time he is fired for being incompetent in the eyes of the administrators and other teachers. Chapters are written almost as short essays on a single topic, moving through the school year. Herndon introduces us to his 7th and 8th grade students with humor and sincerity. Many of these children, to my horror and amazement, can't even read their own names let alone anything else. Herndon discusses what school policies are and how other teachers &quot;control&quot; the class by restricting their movement and even in one case, not allowing the children to utter one word to the teacher during class. Absurdities in school policy and administration come through to me very clearly as I read these stories. The style of writing is one of storytelling rather than a book discussing why school reform is needed, but you will clearly come to your own realizations of what the problems are by simply reading these stories.<br />Half way through the school year, Herndon decides to do whatever it takes to get these children to learn. In some cases he comes up with innovative teaching methods and in other cases he allows the students to find their own way of doing things, and guess, what? Learning happens! Success! Well, the success is in the eyes of the students and in the eyes of this schoolteacher (not in the eyes of the administration). There is mutual respect between students and teacher but the other teachers and administrators think Herndon is an incompetent and that his students are out of control, so they fire him.<br />I figured out the year was 1959, but this could just as well take place today. Herndon's epilogue, written six years after this year of teaching, is brilliant. This is a short book and an easy read. As you read it your mind will be reeling with emotions and ideas about public/government schooling and who are they really serving?en six years after this year of teaching, is brilliant.

The book has detailed instructions and beautiful detailed photographs to follow along with. Six areas of beeswax crafting are introduced to the reader: candle making, beeswax modeling, making cone shaped crayons, encaustic art (melting crayons onto an iron and then &quot;painting&quot; it onto paper), furniture polish, and making beauty creams and soap.<br />As I said this is a great introduction, and as such, sometimes there is only one project per category. I think this book is helpful for a beginner and if you find that enjoy these crafts and you want to do more of one the same, then you may either custom design your own projects (when applicable) or find other recipes or instructions from other books and/or sources. If you know and understand this before buying the book I think you will be very happy.<br />The photographs are wonderful and I found them very helpful. The different kinds of beeswax are explained and important melting safety tips are clearly written. Many different types of candle making are explained, some using sheets of wax that are rolled by hand and others that used melted beeswax. Dipping candles, hand modeling candles, and using molds, both hard and flexible are all included here. Five recipes for creams are included, and one soap that uses beef tallow (fat). Five wood/furniture polish recipes are here, one of which is made with beef tallow. Instructions to make the crayons are here along with tips for successful sketching with them. Encaustic art is clearly explained although it still seemed a difficult craft, and requires specialty equipment, which does not make it easy or inexpensive to try out. (I had previously read about it without accompanying photographs and didn't understand what was being communicated. Other instructions I've read elsewhere don't fully outline the proper materials needed, so this book did a great job of explaining it.)<br />A great introduction if you've never watched these crafts being made in person or if you are a visual learner and have a difficult time following directions that are not accompanied by photographs.r watched these crafts being made in person or if you are a visual learner and have a difficult time following directions that are not accompanied by photographs.	2001-12-06

Scenes from all over America and even an astronaut on the moon holding the American flag are depicted.<br />In the back there are small photos that were depicted in the book with explanations about where they are and other factual information to explain the contents of the photographs. The entire pledge is rewritten in the back pages and an explanation of who wrote it, why, and when. The meaning of why we recite the pledge is given.

A large volume of over 250 pages, there is a lot of background information about cooperative games, why cooperative games are good and why competitive games can be harmful for children. One key point is that playing cooperative games are fun for all and the outcome is a positive attitude, healthy self-esteem, learning communicating with others and working together as a team. All of these traits are what American employers want in an ideal and successful employee. We would be wise to raise our children playing these games to help foster these positive traits rather than pushing them to play competitive team games as extra-curricular activites. Since multi-age games can be played these are ideal for families to play with each other which would enhance family bonds.<br />Good discussion of what parents can do for ages birth to three, which is sometimes left out of other books who focus on age 3 or older and up. Chapters are on birth to 3, 3-7, 8-12, 12 plus, handicapped, and senior citizens. Special considerations for the preschool aged children are explained such as it being typical for a child of this age to not want to participate. The author recommends how to handle the different age-specific issues in a manner that is gentle and considerate of the child. How to start playgroups is outlined.<br />There are great chapters on the authors journey to other countries to learn about games they play, which are mostly cooperative, a discussion of the culture and how it translates into their own cooperative games.<br />Packed with great information on the theory of cooperative games, benefits of playing them, etc. Very interesting read, not just a book that lists out games. Encourages multi-age game playing. Games focus on using an Earth Ball and a heavy canvas parachute, or just bodies.<br />I also loved the chapter on making us aware of how playground equipment is almost designed to make young children quarrel as it is designed for individual play. The author suggests ways that children can share and play cooperatively as an alternative. He also calls for playground designers to change their thinking and make playground equipment cooperative in nature by making the design for several children to use at once.<br />A long list of resources and suggested reading is included. Contains a detailed index.<br />The author is clearly passionate about this subject, the book seethes with enthusiasm. I loved this book! I have since read other books on the subject but so far none compares to this one. Every parent and teacher should read this book.children quarrel as it is designed for individual play.

At 130 pages it is half the size and content of his second book &quot;The Second Cooperative Sports and Games book&quot;. The author discusses the benefits of cooperative game playing, including citing scientific studies to support playing them. Cooperative games foster acceptance, involvement, and fun. These topics are barely touched upon compared to what he writes about in his second book.<br />Chapters include games for preschoolers, 3-7, 8-12, and adults. These age ranges are not as thorough as in his second book. A helpful chapter on remaking adult games for children and another on how to create your own games and how to evaluate your success. Games from other cultures cover only nine pages, unlike his second book, which is far more extensive on this subject.<br />I recommend that you read his second book first for a more thorough discussion of the pro's of playing cooperative games, the con's of competitive games, and more games for more age ranges and for handicapped players and senior citizens. If you have read the second book and want more ideas for games from this author, then read this book.	2001-11-24

A friend recommended this book to me as a very good story. I had a hard time getting interested in the first few pages and put off reading it several times. When I finally decided to read it, I was addicted and finished it in less than two days. I just had to get to the end to find out what would happen. This reads like fiction and it is easier to digest if one thinks of this as fictional but the sad truth is that it really happened...<br />The book is mostly very sad and depressing as it focuses on the verbal and physical abuse of this girl, for as far back as she can remember. I must also add another form of abuse: a withholding of love and affection and outright telling her and treated her as being completely unwanted by her own family. Some parts were so disturbing to me that I had bad dreams all night long about this poor girl's awful family and living situation.<br />Bits of history, tiny tidbits, were intertwined that may not be enough information to make sense to someone ignorant about it. I am ignorant about the history of China, never having been exposed to it in my public school education, and knowing only fragmented bits here and there as portrayed in the American television news, so sometimes I think I may not have understood the full meaning of a certain event, but no matter, there was enough to understand the gist of what was going on. Before reading this book I knew nothing of Chinese culture, status of women, family hierarchy, etc. I was fascinated with learning about the cultural attitudes and this book left me curious to learn more about it. I am also left with a desire to learn more details about the history of China, communism there, etc. I also really want to know what it is like in China right now (the book drops off on what is going on in China in the present, which is not something I am complaining about). I know that this book has inspired me to learn more about China and Chinese culture and I feel that is a good thing, anytime a book can inspire one to learn more, the book is a success, in my opinion.<br />I was disappointed that the author's attitude never turns what I would consider happy or glowing when she finally leaves China, falls in love, and finds success in her career as a physician. I kept waiting for her turning point when she is finally happy and had an overall attitude change. The depressing and sad tone carries on and on to the end. I was saddened that her longing for acceptance from her family persists to the very end. I hope that the author is happy now and hope that maybe it didn't get really written about in this book, or just didn't come through in the book. I hope Mah has reconciled these issues since the writing of the book, in which case we can hope for a sequel which would contain a more positive and glowing attitude. I guess I am hoping for a fairy tale ending!nspire one to learn more, the book is a success, in my opinion.<br />I was disappointed that the author's attitude never turns what I would consider happy or glowing when she finally leaves China, falls in love, and finds success in her career as a physician.

Personally I feel this content is a bit much for 4 year-olds. To glance at the cover it appears to be something about a father and son in an airport. My son picked this up at the library and I didn't read it through before we borrowed it. When I sat down to read it to him I was appalled and made up my own story to match the pictures so he didn't have to hear the true content. It is about a father and sons' homeless lifestyle, living inside the airport. This is a dim and hopeless story. I don't like it at all.<br />The author takes us through the weekdays first, where the boy and his father have learned to dress like travelers and carry luggage, and other things they do to appear like regular traveler's not homeless people who live in the airport. It shows drunken, dirty, shabbily dressed elderly homeless men being arrested and explains that they have learned not to act or look like that. It shows an elderly &quot;bag lady&quot; that is also being addressed by security men or police officers and removed from the premises. It shows them eating in the airport restaurants/cafeteria. The story then shifts to a bird that entered the airport terminal and was trapped, the boy wishes for its' escape and one day it figures out how to get out. The boy and his father never do figure out the same for themselves and by the end of the book are still in their homeless state. Lastly, it shifts to the weekend days when father goes off to work as a janitor and the boy is left in the care of two other homeless people who also live at the airport terminal.<br />I don't like that the airport security guards and the airport rules are portrayed as evil. I don't like that this family of two never gets out. I don't like the way the author explains that these two have learned to disguise and trick and bend the rules for their benefit. I don't think this is a good way to teach 4-8 year-olds about homelessness because it doesn't speak to how they got that way or give any hope for how to get back into living like normal people. I shudder to think about children being exposed to this topic in school with a teacher reading this to them. This is sensitive subject matter and I disagree that it should be introduced to 4 year-olds. Parents should introduce this topic when the child is ready to comprehend such matters. I don't know at what age is appropriate.you decide for yourself!hat way or give any hope for how to get back into living like normal people.

US	51212167	R27ELR88AH6BKH	0446389862	986247842	Homeschooling for Excellence	Books	2	62	80	N	N	A good introduction to the beginner or homeschooling-curious	I am a homeschooling parent and I've read many books on homeschooling and overall was disappointed in this book.<br />The book is small in size and 142 pages, with large font and good-sized margins. Twenty pages are comprised of lists of books and resources they like. Many of the references are from the 1970s and 1980s, since those were the times they were homeschooling their older children. I wonder how many of these books are out of print and also wonder if better books have been published since. Also these materials are simply in a list format and don't contain any opinions about why they liked that book, what the book is about, etc.<br />The beginning was a bit confusing to me as they go back and forth in time explaining their life experience. It jumped around from homeschooling to before they had children, and to when their children were in school. It would have been much better if they just started at the beginning in a chronological order.<br />A chapter on why the government education system in England and America doesn't work is a good introduction to these subjects. Both Colfax's were teachers prior to having children. The Colfax's seem to have firm opinions against government schools yet sent their children there and didn't homeschool until they moved to a rural area and had no other choice. I was surprised that they didn't homeschool from the beginning, it seemed a bit illogical to me to send your child to school when they worked in schools and didn't like what they knew of it. Also they stated they moved to a homestead area with no near school and only after moving did they realize they never considered the education issue for their children. How can someone never think about that? Doesn't every parent think about education issues, school quality, etc. before moving? Homeschooling is explained as a necessary step due to their living situation in a rural area.<br />The sections where they explain \\"how they did it\\" were very skimpy. Reading gets two pages and math gets three pages. My interest in this book is to hear how a family who homeschooled did it, given that three of their four children attended Harvard.<br />I enjoyed the theme of getting back to the land and simplifying their lives, with the cute photos of their children working at their farm, however this is the stereotype that some of us homeschoolers are shunning: that homeschoolers all live in rural areas with no school nearby and are part of a hippie back to the land movement.<br />No mention was made of how their fourth son \\"turned out\\". I was curious about that.<br />In a positive light I was happy to hear their philosophy was basically unschooling but making sure the three R's were covered. A strong sense of family values and helping their family create their homestead in a teamwork atmosphere are accomplishments to be admired. The last chapter is written by a child about his experience in school and explains why school is not a good fit for him and his life-it is excellent and almost worth buying the book for in and of itself.<br />In the end I would say that since this is a fast and easy read, beginning homeschoolers or the homeschooling curious would love this book. It is also a great book to give to relatives to convince them that homeschooling is great and everything will turn out fine for their grandchildren.<br />For more in depth discussions on school issues, unschooling, or more details about \\"how people do it\\", further reading is necessary. Some suggestions are the excellent ... which is full of reviews and detailed summaries of thousands of books and reference materials and written by a mostly-unschooling family-it lets you pick out what you think will be best for your family.s and math gets three pages.

US	51212167	R36SW5NJ3GI085	0876592531	837156543	Block Play	Books	4	43	44	N	Y	Great reference for teachers, tons of information	This book was written by a teacher and geared for preschool and Kindergarten teachers on the use of blocks and block play in the classroom. I read this as a mother and a homeschooler looking for information on how we can best use our &quot;block center&quot;. I found this book would be most helpful for teachers (as it is intended).<br />The author has composed long lists of skills that children can learn through block play, itemized under the categories of math, science, art, literacy, physical development, social studies and social-emotional. These long lists would be helpful for teachers who need to prove to someone that playing with blocks is a worthwhile activity where learning thrives.<br />Ideas for setting up a block center in a classroom are detailed and are great for the classroom but don't translate completely to the home setting. There is a very brief section on choosing blocks, too brief, I believe. I was interested to hear about how many blocks one child would use and of which shapes are most played with so I can choose the best sets or a la carte blocks for our home. This information was not provided as the author states such information has been provided in other publications. Well, I was looking for that information in this book! Blocks are recommended to be stored in a sturdy shelf unit which I think is great but is quite costly for parents (the hardwood unit blocks are a large investment)! I also would have liked an appendix with sources for blocks, the best suppliers and best prices. Despite Internet access I am having problems finding these hardwood unit blocks. There are also ideas for making homemade blocks out of recycled products for younger children, such as large blocks made out of paper bags stuffed with newspaper and covered in contact paper.<br />There is a lot of information on assessment of learning in the block center and how teachers can document in the children's portfolios. This would be great for a teacher but almost completely useless for me as a homeschooler. The documentation process is so detailed honestly, I can't imagine any teacher would have time to document it on more than a few children (taking photos, making cassette recordings of the children playing, writing down stories the children make up, etc.). There are also activities for the teacher to do with the children to teach concepts such as balance, math, etc.<br />I would have liked to see more photos of children playing with the blocks and photos of what they did with them. There is plenty of space in the margins; small photos could have adorned those areas. I would have liked more to be focused on letting the child play rather than using so many props to help them along. The author gives about 100 pages of projects and activities that can be done. Most of these require a large amount of teacher-effort and are for projects such as making people to use in the block center, making playmats, task cards (photos of buildings laminated onto a card), and more. My complaints are that these projects will require a good amount of spending on supplies of laminating paper, contact paper, and cloth mats, Velcro--things that are not inexpensive. They also require the teacher to do all or a large portion of the &quot;craft&quot; and then the child helps a bit at the end, in some of them. My last complaint is that making so many accessories (boxes decorated to look like skyscrapers and the like) takes away from the imaginative play nature of the wooden, unadorned, blocks.<br />This is a great book for teachers who need lots of ideas for accessories and who have a school system paying for lots of blocks, shelves, and craft items. The assessment information is probably invaluable for schoolteachers who need to document what is done in the classroom and justify their request for blocks and block supplies to their school system. It is useful for the homeschooler or parent who wants to spend a lot of time and effort guiding the block play with homemade accessories or for learning about how great block play is for children's development. The book also clearly indicates how valuable block play is, whether the child is left to play alone or whether the teacher or parent adds accessories and does activities with the blocks. I feel that every child should have access to a great set of unit blocks. (My child began playing with them at age one. The only danger is when they are in the throwing-toys stage-ouch!)emade accessories or for learning about how great block play is for children's development.

It is a small sized book with tiny 2-3 page chapters. It is easy to read in bits and pieces.<br />It has been a few years since I first read this book and I just went back to browse over it again. I realized that many of the authors' suggestions I began using back then and am still using. There are some very do-able tips such as trying to touch each piece of mail only once. I was inspired to cancel my weekly newspaper and to scale back on the number of magazine subscriptions as I didn't have time to read them and was feeling pressured to &quot;get to the pile&quot;.  I also donated many sets of linens to a charity after I realized I had too many and wasn't ever going to use them all.<br />There is a great section on saying no and not feeling guilty about saying no. That alone is worth buying and reading the book.<br />I found the book had some wacky suggestions such as owning only one fork, knife and spoon. Other suggestions I couldn't put into effect were when I buy one item of clothing to get rid of one that I already have. I also could not do her meal plan where they eat the same 7 dinners every single week. Yuck.<br />The part that I found not so helpful was that there were really no suggestions regarding being a family with young children. I realized that it must be simpler to simplify ones life when in middle age years (as the author is and describes) than with babies underfoot. I also realized that parents of young children could benefit from some specific ideas to simplify our lives that are unique to our situation. Parents are very pressured to buy the right toys, a lot of toys, the right clothes, enroll in the best preschool, have elaborate birthday parties, do sports at an early age, etc. I would love to hear from someone that it is all right and a good idea to simplify and scale back all this craziness with our young children.

It was difficult to come up with a rating. I guess if I took the helpful parts and ignored the problem areas I would still say I learned things from the book and it was helpful.<br />I will write about the parts that I disagree with, in no special order:<br />1. Swearing is considered normal behavior, there are several references, and two are found on page 25 and 34. I disagree that this is normal. I feel the children will act and speak as they are spoken to, but the authors never state this. The recommendation is to ignore such talk completely. I feel this is the first of several areas where the role of the environment (family life, preschool, etc.) are completely ignored. Sometimes it seems as if the children are being evaluated in isolation instead of considering their environment. I'd rather have seen something said to the effect that if the child is exposed to profanity then they might repeat it so parents should not use language that they don't want their children to use.<br />2. Spanking is mentioned as one option for punishment methods. I feel this is an out of date recommendation as now child psychologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and other experts are advising not to spank or use other such pain-inflicting methods as punishment.<br />3. TV viewing is pushed as a &quot;great new things society has to offer for the preschooler&quot;. The authors write in a patronizing manner stating the stay at home mother has too much to do and can't possibly do it all so let the child watch TV. They state on page 32 that &quot;it can be one of the best techniques for filling some of the day and for meeting Four's high demand for excitement, activity, and drama.&quot; They then go on to gently guide toward not showing programs that go beyond his comprehension but that shows that &quot;attempts to teach letters and numbers or sizes and shapes, and he responds to this teaching, let his interest be your guide. It won't make him smarter, and it probably won't make him read any earlier than he otherwise would have.&quot; I was just surprised at the idea of having the child watch meaningless programs as fine but then to even hint that an educational program won't make him smarter? Huh? Is this really the writing of an M.D. and a PhD? Also these TV recommendations are not in line with the current policy recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics which has strong things to say about limiting TV viewing and to what type of content. Pages 56-7 also discuss using TV as a babysitter and with a patronizing manner toward parents but advocate its use since &quot;it keeps him quiet and entertained&quot;.<br />4. A horrible section states that mothers at home are incapable of providing enough stimulation for their child on pages 22-24. The authors state that preschool and even daycare providers can do a better job at giving the four-year-old adequate stimulation. &quot;Teachers, unlike mothers, are not looking after the child in the midst of other duties.&quot; And it goes on from there. I beg to differ, how would a mother with one or more children compare with watching over her own children as compared to a preschool teacher who may have 20 students to watch out for? I feel a child of age four should definitely be able to play alone or with their siblings long enough for their mother to get some things done that she'd prefer to do alone (some cooking, etc.) I disagree with the implication that the child must rely on the parent to constantly engage them and entertain them. I feel that a child can happily do this while mother is doing something else in the same room or even the next room over.<br />5. I found the section about this age child telling violent stories including death, murder, etc. as strange. I disagree that all children of this age make up their own stories of horrible murder, etc. I feel that if a child is telling such stories they must be seeing themon TV, movies, heard stories in books on the subject, or have some horrible experience in their lives going on to then tell such atrocious stories. I feel that such angry stories must have a root somewhere and just don't appear out of nowhere in a child with a healthy living environment who does not have any kind of abuse inflicted on them, including spanking.<br />6. The chapter titled &quot;individuality&quot; is based on Dr. William H. Sheldon's theory as written in &quot;Varities of Temperament&quot;. I disagree with both the chapter title and the theme here as they mean opposite things. The gist is that there are (only) three different types, endomorph, ectomorph, and mesomorph. Each category is supposed to act a certain way regarding eating, sleeping, emotions, and other issues. My own child is all over the place with regard to these categories so I disagree with the general theory. The author's intent to have a chapter on individuality is smashed by the application of Dr. Sheldon's theory! I don't see any benefit to this entire chapter and feel that some parents may worry that their child is not falling into one proper category as Dr. Sheldon has created.<br />7. I would like to see more about whining (a behavior my four-year-old suddenly developed out of nowhere). The only mention was on page 114 where a mother wrote a letter asking for help with whining. The reply was to spend time with the child and do less housework when the child was not in preschool, which I agree with. They then suggest getting a babysitter for two afternoons a week since he is less likely to whine to a babysitter. I find the two statements contradictory. If the child needs more attention from mother when not in preschool then he should get it.<br />Postscript: Immediately after reading this book I read &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; by Lawrence Cohen PhD, a play psychologist. Cohen feels the negative behaviors described in the above book are signs the child is in need of connection and love from his parents.

We encountered bullying when two children we don't know, aggressively physically attacked my three year-old at the playground when I was only 15 feet away and watching the whole thing.<br />This is a picture book to read to children about bullying. The photos show children with very overly obvious facial features. There are a lot of photos with kids making scary and angry faces. My son said he didn't like the book because of the faces on the children.<br /> I don't like the overall message. First, it focuses on children in school and I don't know their ages but to me they look 7 years or older. It is all focused on school and talking to teachers. It references \\"tattling\\" on the bully to the teacher but the text and the picture don't go on to show that the teacher is open to hearing about the injustice done to the child. I also don't like that they don't show follow-through explaining that the teacher is going to do something about the bullying activity. The teacher in the photo also had body language that looked as if she was thinking \\"what is this kid bugging me about now-I wish he'd go away\\".<br />I would prefer text and images that show the bullying, then discussing it with an adult (not labeled \\"telling on\\") and then the adult explaining to the bully that what was done was wrong and why. Some text about hurting feelings (for verbal abuse) or more harsh language about physical bullying as being completely intolerable would be better to address.<br />There are a couple of references to bullying being done at home as well, which are not really explained. It was something like \\"bullying can be at school but also at home as well\\". There is a lot of talk about bullying activity but nothing really condemning it. There are references to a bully doing bad things because they are also done to them by other people. That concept isn't taken any further and I don't like the excuse making. I also don't know that getting into this psychology is necessary for young children that would be interested in such a picture book format story.<br />I was really disappointed with this book.lso don't know that getting into this psychology is necessary for young children that would be interested in such a picture book format story.<br />I was really disappointed with this book.	2001-10-24

I don't quite see how one can even discuss pirates with small children yet avoid discussions of robbery, guns, killing, and stealing. I don't think it is possible. For this review I will point out some things this book illustrates and discusses and let you decide whether your child is ready for this or may be of an age where these things may be too scary.<br />I borrowed this book from the library and when my son saw the cover he decided it was too scary for him and he didn't want me to read it to him. I read it to see how this author would depict pirates to an intended audience of 4-8 year olds who read picture books.<br />The book has a historical flair, citing places, dates, and real names of pirates. Sometimes I think there are too many dates than a young child would even care to hear about. A general overview of what a pirate is, what they do, and the harm they inflict is depicted. Swords are seen in every illustration and guns abound. Pirates have mean looks on their faces. Kidnapping is mentioned. Illustrations show scenes of pirates taking over ships and throwing people overboard. Actual dueling with swords and fighting with daggers is shown. Some passages can be scary &quot;no treasure ship was safe from the fierce and greedy pirates&quot;. Cannon fighting is discussed and depicted. Shooting of guns in battle is shown. Walking the plank is shown. A picture shows the burning of a ship and is discussed. Treasure maps and treasure burying is briefly mentioned. How the countries dealt with pirates is discussed and mentions that pirates that are caught were often hanged for punishment (opening another can of worms for a child to be exposed to, another discussion for parent and child).<br />A confusing point is made where they say not all pirates are bad, and a pirate, well dressed, is shown holding a pistol and wearing a sword, these are called privateers and were considered heroes. I don't think that was explained well enough to make sense to a young child. It states the kings and queens hired them to rob ships of their enemies. I am so confused by this passage and think it sends mixed signals. This section should have either been discussed in more detail and more clearly or else just eliminated altogether since it leaves the reader confused as to whether killing and stealing is acceptable/good or is it bad (as the whole first part of the book was eluding to)? And why would it be all right and heroic for a king or queen to pay someone to kill and steal for them?<br />The book wraps up with saying that pirates no longer sail the seas and that &quot;most of the oceans and seas are safe for travel&quot;. I dislike that element of unsure-ness over the safety of ocean travel. Yet another element of fear for young children, to think that even today they aren't safe if they go on a boat ride. Brief biographies of some well-known pirates (male and female) are at the end of the book.<br />I give it 4 stars because it is pretty detailed, is historically accurate, and the illustrations are good.

I have issus wth the organization of the verses and the verses not matching the illustrations.<br />One problem lies in that each verse cites up to five different animals and that not all the animals are pictured on the pages. This is very confusing for my four year old who asks me where a certain animal is pictured and it simply is not there. Other pages where the verse references time of day (afternoon) and no animals, show animals. Why not have pictured simple landscapes with skies that relate to that time of day instead? For example the picture for noon doesn't even show a sun, let alone a bright shining sun, it shows a close up of bison, and bison are not mentioned in that passage at all.<br />Sometimes the animals within one passage are not even related to each other by habitat. An example is mentioning a stork, killdeer and a cardinal in the same passage. Yes, they are all birds but they just aren't in the same habitat, preventing them from being depicted in an illustration together. I'd have prefered mentioning three ocean dwelling creatures within one passage, even if some were birds, some fish, and some ocean dwelling mammals.<br />I do love picture books that feature seasonal themes or time-of-day themes. I also love books that feature animals.<br />I have never seen such an annoying arrangement of verses and such a mismatch of words with illustrations in a picture book for young children. For this confusion and annoyance, I grant one star. I dislike it so much that I can't stand to read it to my children and am donating it to my local library.	2001-09-14

This is the biggest disappointment yet. The illustrations are gorgeous (hence 2 star rating rather than 1 star), but there is just too much fantasy for our taste. The blend of fantasy with reality just doesn't flow. The boy uses his bubble blowing solution and has the elephant's blow up the circus train like giant balloons. As explained in the summary (above) the human cannonball acts as the engine for this now-floating circus and tows the train up and over the broken down train bridge and on to the circus. The next shot is the boy at this same circus, with his parents. In the end the clowns reappear for the lonely boy to play baseball with, along with some real children. This is so fantastical in nature it confused me and my son, making me wonder if all or part of this escapade was a figment of the lonely boy's imagination. I guess we prefer more realistic books on trains, we save the fantasy for other subjects. My conclusion was that the boy imagined the part about helping the circus train to ease his boredom and loneliness, and later did really attend the real circus with his parents. I also assume he is again entering the fantasy world to play a baseball game with imagined clowns and imagined children.	2001-09-14

We start out with passengers arriving at the airport and go through all the various activities that take place through take off. What happens to the luggage, getting the plane ready for take off, etc. are covered. A cross-section of a jet plane shows the various parts including toilet (which children think is hilarious) and also shows staff working to clean the plane before the passengers board.<br />This would be a great book to read to a child who is preparing to travel by airplane. It would be great preparation to understand all that goes into preparing the plane, what is happening as the people are waiting to board, etc. It would also be a great book to take on the flight as entertainment, especially since it is a thin paperback and lightweight.<br />Lots of people are in the airport and are of all ages and races.<br />Barton also has a board book about planes which depicts different kinds of airplanes, titled &quot;Planes&quot;. &quot;Airport&quot; focuses just on jet passenger airplanes and the airport itself. If you enjoy this book I recommend Barton's other books as well.<br />My baby loves this book, he must love the illustrations. My four year old loves the book for the content. We are frequent airplane travelers and we have made air travel an adventure, always discussing all that goes on and intentionally making it a real fun experience. It has been successful so far because we don't experience air travel stress with either of our children. Both look at a trip to the airport as an adventure in and of itself. This book gives us more opportunities to discuss flying when we are at home, in between trips.<br />This is the only children's book I have ever seen that discusses airports and what goes on there.<br />Great, a must have!	2001-09-11

It is a very high quality picture book. As with other picture books published in the early part of the 1900s, there is a lot of text on each page. The illustrations are just absolutely gorgeous: museum like quality paintings. About every other page is a full color painting with a high level of detail. The other pages are adorned with black line drawings. The book is arranged in chapters. The story is about a brother and a sister who live near a newly constructed train line. The children fall in love with the trains and want to learn all about them. The children get to know the train workers who teach them, in high detail, about the workings of the train. The children go on a train ride in the cab with the engineer, a visit to the roundhouse, seeing a break-down crane train, a visit to the freight yard, and a trip inside a passenger coach. There are similar stories and adventures, which I am not listing here.<br />This book is very detailed yet held the interest of my train loving 3 year-old. I highly recommend it for all young train lovers. I wish there were more books on the market like this one. After reading this, the modern children's books look like very watered down text with lesser quality illustrations.<br />Due to the high level of detail, this book ends up being educational in nature, although written as pure storytelling.  It is also not at all boring to for the adult to read to children!	2001-09-11

I also did not read this book before reading it aloud to my son. I was kind of shocked at the content but my just turned 4-year-old was just fine with it all and he loves the book. You decide if your child is ready for this story.<br />This is a true story that took place in the year 1900 in America. To make a long story short, Casey Jones (a Caucasian) was an engineer of a steam locomotive who was never late with his passengers. One night there was a broken down freight train stuck on the track and they were headed right for it, going to collide. Casey realized that he would be killed so he told his fireman (an African American) to jump to save his life. The fireman jumped and lived to tell the tale. Casey pulled the break and the locomotive was smashed to smithereens and he was killed. All the passengers lived and escaped serious harm. Casey is called an American hero because he saved the lives of the passengers and gave his own life to save them.<br />So my son is fine with this. We had discussed death in the past and he understands the concept of death and that people die. He also understands that crashes/accidents sometimes result in injury or death. When I first read this I was surprised at a picture book for young children containing a story about the death of an engineer. But since he was fine with it and it was a heroic death, I am fine with it as well. My devil's advocate says that sometimes we shelter our children from knowing about death, while another part of me questions at what age they should be exposed to discussions about death.<br />The only other possibly controversial image and text refers to the western settlers and railroads..&quot;their power brought destruction, the death of a way of life, disaster for the Native American&quot;, and shows a Native American sprawled on the ground with eyes closed, as if dead, clutching a rifle. I just have not broached the whole subject with my son yet, I think the whole Native American element and the history of the settlement of the west, is a bit beyond his ability to comprehend, at this age of just turned 4 years old. We are struggling with discussions about war and guns and killing. Some discussions we've had as a result of seeing some commercials on TV with war images have so far resulted in nightmares.  I just wanted to let you know about these components so you can decide if this book is right for your child.<br />The illustrations are fun and cartoon like, as seen on the cover.ching a rifle.

This time around he uses phrases &quot;I want to&quot; followed by various actions of astronauts who fly a space shuttle into space to do various astronaut tasks: working, eating, sleeping, etc. Simple text, adored by my son.<br />Barton's books are a staple in our family. There is just something about the illustrations that my children love. The words, although simple, still capture the and hold the attention of my four year old.<br />Female astronauts and people of various ethnicity's are represented.<br />Regarding the age recommendation that some reviewers are discussing, I want to add that since infancy, my son has loved Barton's books, whether they are board versions or regular paper versions. This book is loved by my less than one year-old son, and continues to enthrall my now 4 year-old son, who does have a fascination with space and astronauts. I would recommend this book for babies who don't rip regular paper books, and for 4 year-olds and maybe 5 year-olds who especially love space. If the older child is *not* especially interested in all things space they may be bored with the simple text.	2001-09-11

Due to the rave reviews I'd read here and at another source, I purchased this book. What none of the reviews said is this: the storyline is that train driven by humans goes around picking up baby animals while the parents wave goodbye to them. They go to a &quot;children's zoo&quot; and a schoolbus and school teacher arrive with young human children. They all play together, that is the end.<br />I guess I don't understand why the baby animals are being taken away from their famiies. All I could think of was that this is like preparing our children to separate from parents, as in, going to daycare. I don't like the emphasis on the separation. I do understand why the children are in school, obviously to get an education. To me this is a message to the children I am reading this book to: that human children should be separating from their parents and spending the day with other similarly aged children. I would have preferred to see animals in general getting on the train, or the human children getting on the train to go a normal zoo with the usual animal families. I enjoy books where the family unit is intact and where the parents are happily interacting with their children.<br />I also don't like that one baby animal carries a &quot;lovey&quot; blanket and one boy does also. I just don't like &quot;lovey&quot; objects as they are usually initiated by the parent as a way for the baby or young child to provide nighttime comfort and to self-soothe with (when the parent is not co-sleeping to provide the historically normal parenting comfort). Animals all sleep together (as many humans do) so I especially am bothered by that illustration of the baby animal with a &quot;lovey&quot;.<br />A side note, I am not interested in the school association as I am homeschooling. Not everyone sends their children to school and not every child rides on a big yellow schoolbus! Couldn't the entire family be visiting the animals in the zoo rather than making this associated with separating the human children from their parents (even if it is to go to public school)?<br />The words are fun and my son does love this book.

Modern motherhood is viewed by defining the various roles mothers perform. Some roles are entertainer,  role model, juggler, nurturer, and even lover, the author defines who a mother is to the various loved ones in her family. Cute little drawings illustrate the humorous and serious aspects of each role.<br />This book contains references more toward the mother of school-aged children and teenagers. There are no references to mothering babies, such as breastfeeding or diaper changing. (As the mother of young children I wish there was a volume for just mothering babies and toddlers! I am sure it would be wonderful.) There are references to listening to your child's problems and sitting down to discuss things over tea and Kleenex.

These first newsletters were all written by Holt (versus staff writers) with the exception of some printed letters from readers. I have been subscribing to GWS for a few years but had never actually read anything written by Holt (who is now deceased). I was wonderfully delighted by these newsletters and could not put this book down.<br />These writings are a collection of subjects such as: suggesting homeschooling as an option to compulsory schooling, legal issues surrounding the ability to homeschool including having to make up one's own private school name, problems with formal schooling (public and private), how children learn naturally without much help from adults, and that children are capable of handling more responsibility than adults usually allow them to. Holt advises on how parents should deal with the school administrators such as when portfolio reviews are necessary. There is a good amount about the growing homeschooling movement and the legal issues; if that does not appeal to you then just skip over it and there is plenty of other information to make reading and buying this volume worthwhile. Holt includes some letters from readers and then responds, and other times he just prints up a response to issues raised by parents. Interspersed are ideas for ways to teach certain things better such as reading and writing and other useful tidbits. Holt also discusses various books that he has read and tells his opinions of them. Of note: these back issues are much more anti-school and negative in tone than the current issues of the magazine which focus more on just pro-homeschooling and are more of a positive attitude. Holt mentioned in one of these first issues that he hoped someday that GWS would evolve to be a forum for homeschooling families to write of their successes and I feel that indeed that is what has occurred. (The first issues were just Holt doing the writing and the current issues of GWS are almost all reader-submitted essays.)<br />Very readable and enjoyable. It made me want to buy all the back issues of GWS. I have since gone on to read some of Holt's books, which tackle specific areas (see my other reviews). As a homeschooling parent it made me feel more confident in both my children's natural ability to learn and of my ability as a person not educated in college as a schoolteacher to be capable and even a superior &quot;teacher&quot; for my own children.<br />I highly recommend that anyone thinking of homeschooling their children read this. Open-minded teachers would learn some helpful tidbits as well.re just Holt doing the writing and the current issues of GWS are almost all reader-submitted essays.) <br />Very readable and enjoyable.

There are many delicious recipes and this card format is very easy to use when mixing up drinks (can't close itself in the middle of my mixing the drink, etc.). The recipes are easy to read and storing this deck of recipe cards in its' own little box holder doesn't take up much space in the kitchen. It is easy to store right next to your drinking glasses inside the cabinet. Most cards have beautiful photographs of the featured smoothie. The cards show the photo or a graphic on one side and then the recipe is on the other side.<br />My complaints have to do with some formatting and organization issues. First, if these recipes were in a book they'd be categorized and separated by chapters. When these recipes transitioned to a card deck format, the author did not use any kind of organization method to distinguish one type of smoothie from the other. With the subtitle of the deck being &quot;50 recipes for high-energy refreshment&quot; I was surprised to see things with alcohol and sweet dessert-only type smoothies. (That subtitle is a bit deceiving, and given that this deck is shrink-wrapped in plastic preventing browsing before buying, it is a little more bothersome to me.) But that is fine, I am interested in these smoothies, but would rather see some kind of categorization. For example: every single card has a teal background with the words in white font. Why not color-code the backgrounds by category such as &quot;sweet dessert smoothies&quot;, &quot;meal in a glass (very nutritive in nature)&quot;, &quot;high energy&quot;, and &quot;alcoholic&quot;?  All that would be needed is one background color for each type. Another idea would be to have small icons/symbols to note which type of smoothie it is, possibly near the top of the card so we can shuffle through quickly for the type of drink we want to make. As they are now, the only way to tell one smoothie type from another is to read through the ingredient list.<br />Fun, useful and delicious recipes!is to read through the ingredient list.<br />Fun, useful and delicious recipes!	2001-06-10

There are no references to studies, etc. that show that massage is better. (Other books I've seen have pages of references.) Infant and child bonding is not explored or discussed nearly as much as I would have liked to have seen. There is only one half of a page of information about massaging premature babies and no illustrations for these instructions. There are two pages discussing special needs children which is very vague, not really discussing the various different special needs issues.<br />Every body part is matched to a new-agey reference such as the sides of the body linking to &quot;the many sides of life&quot; and the inner legs with &quot;vitality&quot;.<br />I was surprised there was no reference for special techniques to use on the colicky or fussy baby: the main reason that parents I know are first drawn to infant massage. This book does give the different instructions for baby and then the older child.<br />Line drawings, mostly of the body part, are on one side with very long written instructions next to it. I would prefer to show the whole baby as it is a reminder that the baby is a whole person. (Reminds me of Western medical doctors who view their patients as just body parts or diseases, unconnected to a real whole person.) The layout of illustration next to directions is nice but the instructions are so long that it would not be easy to follow if trying to read while actually doing the massage technique.<br />A slim volume. If you just want directions with illustrations then you would like this book. I think there are better books on the market that discuss massage more in detail, do address colic, fussiness, and have more on premature infants and special needs babies and children.<br />Of note for those interested the cover shows three Caucasian children, the back has one dark skinned child (not African-American) and one Asian child.

This is a combination/collection of essays by two homeschooling parents (one now deceased, sadly). The book and product reviews are interspersed amongst essays and stories about their homeschooling experiences and philosophies. There are reviews of books, audio tapes, kits, etc. There are lists of magazines, catalogs, and other publications such as free materials available mostly from government agencies. It is partly a catalog since many of the items may be purchased directly from the authors who are also the publishers and also their own mail order catalog business.<br />What I enjoyed first was the essays and stories of how they homeschooled and why, and how their philosophies sometimes changed over time. Some of the reviews are lengthy and tell how they used that product and how much their children liked it and why. The reviews I like the most are the longer ones in which pros and cons are both mentioned. The reviews I liked least were the short one sentence summaries that really didn't contain any personal opinion. Overall, the reviews are positive in nature so it can be hard to pick out which book may appeal to me. Since so many items are reviewed I do understand that space is limited and the author has  a limit on not wanting to include the reviews that are only negative in nature (although I'd find that equally helpful and it may save me money). The book has a tone of &quot;if you don't have anything nice to say the don't say anything&quot;. I also wish there was a bit more commentary such as &quot;this book is strong in this area while the next book is strong in this different area&quot;. One example is for different books for preschoolers on topics of shapes, colors, counting, etc. There was some overlap in areas and then the review didn't tell enough for me to decide which of the featured items I would prefer.<br />Some other negatives: I found it hard to pick out the age ranges for the books; topics are mostly by major subject such as science, reading, etc. There are no headers or footers to tell what category you are &quot;in&quot; when the pages are open. Kits are mixed with books, etc. in some cases which can get confusing. Margins are very narrow and don't allow much room for making notations such as which books I decided to buy. Sometimes it is hard to tell where one item ends and the next begins. Sometimes the organization is confusing such as an entry for a website with good homeschooling information mixed in with book reviews (without some kind of sidebar). The copyright free illustrations can get annoying and sometimes make the book seem overly cluttered.<br />As the mother of a three year old and a baby, I found this book severely lacking in book reviews for babies and preschoolers. (Despite the authors claiming this book begins with birth-aged materials.) Many books that I have found very helpful for parenting, general reading books, and preschool aged activity books were just missing.<br />Areas I found of most interest were the reviews of books on history and how to teach reading. These were two areas that I was worried about dealing with as a homeschooling mother. I was glad for the guidance toward the useful books.<br />Despite my complaints the book has been very helpful and inspiring for me. I have a long wish list made now! Going through the book more than once, I  now value this as more of a reference tool. It is worth every penny and I highly recommend it to all homeschoolers especially if you compare the cost of this book to books you may have bought that ended up being useless. The fact that this is self-published by a homeschooling mother is incredible and to be commended.<br />Many times there were great reviews of books when I have been unable to find reviews online.<br />I am recommending this to all my homeschooling friends. Would also make agreat reference book for teachers and public libraries.ke a great reference book for teachers and public libraries.	2001-06-06

I also love nature and animals and thought this book sounded great. Unfortunately I didn't like it much at all. Many of the animals here are animals I've never heard of in my lifetime or if I learned them in public school I've since forgotten them. I feel that children learn best and easiest when what they are learning is relative to their life or their interests. This book won't work well for our family since many of the animals portrayed are not from our region of the world and they (and I) just can't relate to them. Some examples are Aye-Aye, Hyrax, Springbok and Vizcacha. Since I've not heard of these animals and they are from other cultures I honestly am guessing at the pronunciation. Since such obscure and diverse animals are represented it would have been helpful if the author included how to pronounce the word!<br />There is one page per letter with the letter being shown in both capital and lower case print which is great. The featured word is written in small font just as the 3-4 sentences that describe this animal. I prefer to see the featured word in much larger font separately featured from the paragraphical description. Since such diverse animals are represented I feel the author should have told us the geographic region that these animals live in (for all the animals not just a few).<br />Again, I feel that the animals are too complex and not familiar to preschool aged children living in America to have relevance in their lives and to help teach the alphabet. I guess I am looking for a furry animal of North America book!<br />I concur with one of the other reviews, which stated this book would be better to introduce some wild animals than teaching the alphabet.	2001-06-06

The idea of using the real chocolate next to the book is just beyond me!<br />Even if the book were to be used alone, I would not use it. I have given my copy away as I don't plan to use it when teaching my children. (We are homeschooling.) I found it confusing because the illustrations were fractions but not comparing it to the whole on the same page. For example, (in general as I no longer own the book), it said 3/4 and showed three pieces of the Hershey bar but not an illustration that I would have preferred which would have been the full bar on one side saying 4/4 and then the other then saying 3/4, so the reader can look back and forth to compare the different fractions to the different illustrations. This is kind of difficult to explain here but suffice it to say I read the whole book and was having trouble &quot;getting it&quot; and I do have a full understanding of fractions! Not wanting to confuse my children, I will use my own manipulatives such as the fraction cubes that can be used side by side.<br />I think this is just one more in the series of the &quot;food photo&quot; books that are trendy right now. Just because the first one published was good does not mean all these similar &quot;using food photo books to teach something&quot; are good.<br />Oh, and I am a chocolate lover so there is no anti-chocolate-bias !	2001-06-06

This book is read many times and is holding up well. Any baby or younger child who likes airplanes will love this book. It would also be helpful to read to children who are getting ready to take an airplane flight.<br />Cartoonish and simple drawings with thick black outlines and pretty bold colors. Text is very simple &quot;this is a jet plane with people inside&quot;. Very simple wording yet NOT annoying. Quick to read through and then my son asks for it over and  over and honestly, I don't mind the repetition for this book (unlike some other books we own....) At 3 years old he now has it memorized and sits and &quot;reads&quot; it to himself over and over. My baby also likes this book and carries it all over the house and &quot;reads&quot; it to himself with babbling baby talk.<br />I can't wait to buy more of this author's books and wish they were all available in board book format as this one gets a lot of use in our home.<br />I have not seen other books about planes in board book format that are appropriate for baby through the preschool ages, making this is a unique book.	2001-06-06

This is more like a book that would be kept on a coffee table by an adult that adores butterflies. I still love it despite my misconception!<br />This is an amazing work. The author is actually a nature photographer who accidentially noticed that some patterns on butterfly's wings are shaped like letters of the English alphabet while looking at the wings under a microscope. He then took very close photographs of the &quot;letters&quot;. He then went around the world hoping to find each of the 26 letters in our alphabet; this journey took 25 years. Now that is a labor of love!<br />The end result is this: on the left side of the page is a full color photo of the entire butterfly. One sentence describing butterflies with one of the words beginning with that letter of the alphabet is written in very poetic language that would be most appreciated by adults or anyone who enjoys poetry. Note that the featured letter is written in capital only and in script style so this is of no use to preschoolers who need to see both capital and lower case letters in PRINT. The name of the butterfly is then given. On the right side of the page is a huge photograph of the close up that shows the pattern on the wings that looks just like the featured letter of the alphabet.<br />Incredible! Interesting!<br />This would be of interest to anyone who is interested in butterflies. Possibly a good tool to show when introducing microscopes and what they can reveal and also when teaching about butterflies and science/nature.	2001-06-06

This book has various elements that are unique to an alphabet book. First, the A starts off with January and goes through the year with Z ending with December. This is noted at the bottom of the page and the month/season is depicted in the illustration. For example A for Antler shows a snowy landscape in the back. Another example is August showeing the time that beavers build a dam in their Pond (P). I love the seasonal element especially since I feel our young children are growing up with only commercial holidays as the indicators of our seasons (locked inside air conditioned buildings away from nature, etc.). The illustrations are woodcuts that were then colored with paint and they are beautiful and fun. (Can you tell I am also a woodcut admirer?) The illustrations are sometimes lifestyle representing such as E as Evening depicting parent and children reading and writing by lantern-light and Q as Quiet near the edge of the pond. (These illustrations are not purely animal or nature references.) Some modern day machines also are represented by G as Grader and O as Outboard (boat motor) so this is not purely an old-fashioned or timeless depiction. Letters are represented in woodcut with both capital and lower case print style and the word features woodcut as well with the first letter of the word in capital and the rest in lower case. A short paragraph of usually two sentences describes the scene and often times includes personal experiences of the author.<br />Reminds me of &quot;A Farmers Alphabet&quot; which represents old-fashioned life in Vermont for its lovely woodcut illustrations and clearly marked letters that are good for teaching young children the alphabet.<br />This author has a similar book on counting which I plan to read and buy in the future called &quot;Gathering&quot;. I am hoping it is as wonderful as this book.	2001-06-06

Toys and activities are those commonly played with at Waldorf Schools and are all made from natural materials or metal. Children are multicultural.<br />Scenes include: boy laying with wood train with a doll riding it, girl playing with dolls, wood tricycle, play scarves, old-fashioned doll carriage, gnome dolls, real tree blocks, old-fashioned wood toys such as a marble run, wooden playstands, tea party with cloth doll and stuffed animal, children making music with wooden and metal instruments, drawing with block crayons and wet on wet watercolor painting, playing house with chestnuts, wooden kitchen appliance toys, boy and girl taking a bath together and playing with non-plastic bath toys.<br />There is enough detail in the pictures to make up stories to tell your child. The uniqueness of this book is that all the playthings are Waldorf-inspired and there is no plastic in sight. Seeing children having fun without watching television or playing videogames is depicted.<br />My one negative comment is that there is a large baby bottle in one scene (it looks to be for the baby). I disagree with the depiction of baby bottles in children's books as I feel it perpetuates bottle feeding as normal and natural. Everything else in the book is &quot;natural&quot; in nature-so this inclusion of a tool which is  a breast substitute is disappointing to me. Why not stick to the natural theme and not show anti-breastfeeding images? Thus, the four star-rating rather than a five-star rating.	2000-12-30

They decide to take an early morning walk in the woods, hoping to spy deer. Everything is covered in dew and is mystical looking. The watercolor illustrations are wonderful and unique. Along the way, they see many kinds of wildlife, but no deer. They are having fun despite not actually seeing any deer. After returning home for breakfast, two deer are seen peering into their house watching them!<br />The tone of the book is relaxing and calm. It is clear the mother and son love spending time together. Nature is seen as beautiful and to be respected. It is hard to describe, but this book is just different than any I have ever read. Something else I like about this book is that it celebrates the simple things in life; showing that a simple walk through the woods can be a fun adventure for mother and son to do together. Anyone who respects nature or appreciates the simple pleasures in life will love reading this book to their child.	2000-12-30

Their journey includes a walk past the &quot;ghost-tree&quot; which everyone is scared of. The first pass-by goes well and they don't want to admit they are scared (but they are). The second time the wind moves the tree and they hear a big &quot;whoo&quot; sound and they get scared and run. As readers we can see the owl in the tree (that made the noise) and we know that the tree's branches were blowing in the wind, not reaching out to grab the children (as they thought).<br />This is a good book to read to children to show that it is all right to feel scared, but that most times our fears are unfounded.<br />The parts I don't approve of are that three times the sister makes fun of her brother's hat and says it looks dumb and that it makes him look stupid. I don't like that kind of talk. He tries to stick up for himself but we see that at one point he has accepted that the hat he loves does look dumb and that he does look stupid. I felt bad for him. At this point the sister says that she didn't really mean what she said. But later when the hat is back on (they lost it temporarily), she goes back to name-calling and teasing. And the dairy farmer also teases the boy about the hat and says it looks like a good bucket to put the milk in. The poor boy gets defensive and is upset by the further teasing from the farmer.<br />The book ends with the boy still being afraid of the ghost-eye tree. The book is spooky and may scare sensitive children. Overall I don't think this is any wonderful kind of story, the illustrations are nothing special. When I read it aloud to my son in my husband's presence, I asked for his opinion. He said, &quot;it is a big nothing&quot;. I agree. My low rating is a combination of my dislike of the teasing and the mediocre storyline and illustrations.	2000-12-30

His mother tells him he just has to wait. We know not for what until the end. He is waiting to take his first flight. When he finally gets to fly he loves it and enjoys the sites.<br />Charming illustrations in chalk pastel. Owls are very cutesy looking (cartoon-ish) with very large eyes (versus a more accurate portrayal of what they really look like).<br />There is just nothing special about this book. I find it boring. Unless you have a special affection for owls or want to read to your child about how sometimes we must wait to do something we want, I recommend skipping this book. While the content is innocent, friendly, no violence or negative comment, I just can't see any reason why I should rate this higher than 2 stars.	2000-12-30

This is a book inspired by the works of Rudolph Steiner (called Anthroposophy) and the Waldorf Education method that he created. This book is recommended for parents of Waldorf students. Those homeschooling with a Waldorf-inspired flavor will definitely be interested in this book. There are Anthroposophical statements peppered throughout the book that are not explained at all. Those not interested in Anthroposophy can just ignore these statements and use the various songs, verses, etc.<br /><br />The book is very well organized by general theme. This book is about rhythm in daily life, so the topics are: waking up, mealtime, playtime, work, quiet time, healing from injury, bedtime, and weekend family time. Special chapters for parents only are \\"personal renewal\\" and parents as peacemakers. A long appendix offers resources for music, verses, and stories. Every section is organized by the following topics: general discussion about the author's reflections, simple rituals, insights, songs, a listing of pertinent stories in various books, and an actual story to tell (text of story written out). The songs include sheet music and all the notations so that an instrument may be played along as it is sung. Music is in the pentatonic scale as recommended by Rudolph Steiner. Many of the songs and verses were written by the author.<br /><br />What impressed me most about this book was that it is so well organized and contains so many topics. This is a wonderful jumping off point for beginning to celebrate rhythm and rituals into normal daily life with our children. There is enough material here for the parent to design their own circle time. Another bonus is the personal insight and opinion that Ms. Darian includes. Unlike other books on the market, this is not just a listing of verses and songs. I highly recommend this for any Waldorf parent who wants to add some ritual into their day, or for any homeschooler wanting the same.into their day, or for any homeschooler wanting the same.	2000-12-30

I purchased this as part of a series of books for beginner readers in the Dr. Seuss series. Four adults have read this book and we all agree that this is really sick stuff.<br />The little sister bunny is the subject of verbal teasing and physical tricks such as &quot;smashing carrots&quot; on her head at the dinner table. (Real lovely and funny, huh?) More tricks and nasty deeds follow. They go noticed by the parents until one final act and little sister tattles on her brother. Only then do the parents tell the older brother to leave her alone. They don't explain why what he is doing is bad. They don't ask him to apologize and he does not apologize. He chooses to abandon her and go play with other friends and basically ignore her for a while. Mother explains that &quot;he is playing with friends&quot; instead of spending time with her. She gets lonely and tells her mother that his lack of abuse on her is a sign of his not loving her anymore. The mother says that he does love her and shows her that he has resumed his abuse on her by painting her face with paint again. Little sister is happy and gives her brother a hug. Mother must also be happy as she disappears at that point and mother does not.<br />This is the most negative children's book that I have ever read to date, and the only book that I have ever read that approves of verbal and even physical abuse. This is an illustration of how a sibling relationship should not be. And especially a relationship between older brother and younger sister. I have no idea why this book was allowed to be published. This is definitely one for the trash heap. I will not donate this copy to the library or even sell it to a used book store as I don't want this terrible message taught to preschool aged children (the audience it is written for).<br />I am a mother who wants to raise her boys not to be violent, that teasing is not all right, name-calling does hurt, and physical abuse of other humans is not permitted and is not allowed by our society. I am raising my boys to learn to communicate well with others, admit their mistakes, and apologize when they are wrong. I am sensitive to the messages that we give our children through books, television, and also by viewing how adults interact with each other. There are better books out there to teach the lessons that tormenting others is not alright-I do not feel that this book is a good springboard for discussion even if the discussion is to address abuse and what constitutes a healthy relationship.

Backpack baby is riding in a backpack on his father's back. He has a secret and whispers it to various people they pass on the street. We know not what the secret is until the end: Backpack baby has a new baby who is in a carrier on the front of Daddy! What a cute story.<br />Any parent who uses a baby carrier of any kind will appreciate this story as scenes depicting baby carrying are rarely seen in children's literature.<br />The only negative is the inclusion of backpack baby holdinga baby bottle. A disappointment to me as a breastfeeding mother. I don't like images of baby bottles in children's literature as I feel it portrays bottle-feeding as the normal infant feeding method.  If he is old enough to speak sentences to passers-by I'd think he should be drinking from a cup instead anyway!

(Well, that sounds harsh but it is true.) Very charming little book. Each page has a little rhyming ditty where the acorn asks who helped him get along to the next stage of his life and then there is a reply. The sentences are on one page and the opposite page is a beautiful illustration of a forest scene depicting the tree's life stage. It is hard to describe, but one example is that the question is about who made him strong and the reply is the Earth and then the illustration is of a wide, strong oak tree with a horse standing next to it. Each illustration includes at least one type of wild animal close to the tree. The change of seasons is seen. The book ends with the tree having been old and rotting and then cut down to a stump, with the seeds scattered at its' roots and the seed promising to tell the acorn's story.<br />I love this book! I especially am interested in nature books. The life span of the tree is a topic rarely depicted in a picture book. I also love the change of seasons being shown and the various wildlife animals in the illustrations. Illustrations of the animals are life-like (not cartoon-ish).	2000-12-30

Also reviewed are the ways a baby poops in a diaper, small child in a potty, and older children and adults on a toilet. Hysterical graphics such as rear view of child sitting on toilet with the poop in midair, which we see between the gap in his buttock cheeks. Other scenes demonstrate how the toilet is flushed and the poop is washed down the pipes.<br /><br />Illustrations are cartoon like. This was originally published in Japan and therefore the human characters are all Asian. How lucky for us English-speaking parents to have this translated version!<br /><br />The goal of this book is to review with the child the progression of moving from diapers to toilets. It is a funny way to talk about poop with the child. Every child who has seen our book laughs out loud. Many adults who have seen our book think it is so funny. The exception is my husband who thinks this is just gross. If you need to interject some humor in the toilet learning process, read this to your child!<br /><br />Update December 2008: I'm surprised that I had said my husband thought the book was gross. He went on to like it, laugh at it, and to really like the book. By the time we were reading the book to our second child, my husband loved the book. We now buy this book for gifts for toddlers who are approaching the toilet training time.<br /><br />Also Note: Toilet training is not always easy. No picture book can train your child to use the toilet! But a book can be a gateway for discussion between parent and child, and it can (depending on the book) add an element of laughter, which can be good medicine to what can sometimes be a stressful time for parent and child alike, especially for kids who are really anxious and scared about toilet training.	2000-12-30

She has lots of chores, gardening, harvesting, canning, etc. and she is so busy that she only has time to read in the winter months.

Happy tale of a busy woman. It is a bit strange that the wild animals are hanging around insider her house. If you are looking to expose your child to Australian animals this will be a fun read for you.<br />This story does show that an elderly gray-haired woman can find happiness and lead a full life, being both mentally active and physically active, and can live what is sometimes a physically challenging life in the country. Portrays a self-sustaining woman in a positive light. There are not many images of elderly women leading such a life available in children's books--this is a rare subject.	2000-12-30

Actually this is the most romantic and beautiful portrayal of space travel that I have ever seen. Rather than focusing on science and technology this is all about a boy's romance with space. The illustrator has done a wonderful job taking what is usually dark and cold looking (moon's surface, etc.) and making them look beautiful, haunting, and romantic. A man looks back on his boyhood fascination with all things space and recalls the night he watched the first moonwalk on television. We learn of the different ways he would daydream of space, making a scrapbook of space photos, etc. Then he watches the moonwalk on TV in the middle of the night and images of the moonwalk are shown. Later, while sleeping, he has a dream that he was with the astronauts on the moonwalk. It ends with more romantic musings from the now-adult man about what it is like on the moon and how the footprints those astronauts made will remain there for millions of years. A beautiful story. The point of the story is just about the boy's romantic notions of space flight and space in general. It is not heavier than that, there are no lessons to be learned, etc. but a nice story for any child who loves space and dreams of what space travel would be like.	2000-12-28

Yes, this is a thanks to the Lord for all the creatures on the Earth, and the Earth itself. For those that have not yet read it, I want to tell you that it is not overly religious but instead is more of communicating the wonder and beauty of nature and our world. This would definitely appeal to environmentalists, one example being that one passage states the hunter and the hunted are &quot;both the same&quot; rather than the usual Catholic-religion idea that man rules over nature. The text rhymes and so has a singsong quality that children love. The book is large format with most pages having a large illustration spread across both pages. I love that on most of these pages there are 5-6 little cubes on the bottom with smaller illustrations that correspond very closely to the text. One example is &quot;praise for brothers wind and air, serene or cloudy, foul or fair&quot; the small illustrations are a windmill, a weathervane, a sailboat on white-capped waves, a boy holding a balloon in windy weather, clothes drying on the clothesline in the breeze, and a kite flying. I love these illustrations as they give the parent more to talk about and to teach new words (weathervane was one that my 3 year-old had not yet learned). This book is unlike most that are available. People are shown in many different skin tones and some are very obviously from non-American countries (India, Africa). The collage type illustrations are lovely and this illustration method is not commonly seen.	2000-12-28

My interest in this book was my fascination with ABC books as a method of teaching my children the alphabet and to read as well as a budding interest in medieval times.<br />At least one of the pages is featured per letter; sometimes the illustration goes across two pages. The illustrations are beautiful and highly detailed. With each word there is a 3-4-sentence explanation of what the word is about. The author states he has gone to great lengths to make the illustrations historically accurate. The author quotes 15 references as the source of his information and he so loves all things medieval that he includes 5 recommended reading materials for readers who are interested in learning more. I love the purist stance the author takes and appreciate the recommended reading section. It is apparent that this is a labor of love for Mr. Hunt.<br />As the homeschooling mother of young children I say: The featured letter is shown in capital form only and highly decorated which is not conducive to teaching young children the alphabet. The words are medieval in nature and therefore not in everyday language of young children. Examples are excalibur and oriflamme. The text is written in language that may be difficult for even young readers to understand, let alone preschool-aged children. Older children with an interest in medieval times will love this book.<br />As an adult interested in medieval times, I found this a fun book with lovely illustrations. I enjoyed learning some basic information about some medieval terms.	2000-12-28

A bit predictable in some parts but overall was very entertaining. The author writes about life of a whale from his infancy until he becomes a father and leader of the whale pod. Others have written reviews that reveal more about the content so I will refrain from repeating what they have said. Just think of what life would be like as a whale and how things look from a whale's perspective. The only thing that I find a bit questionable is that the whales are given a VERY human-like intelligence and emotional capacity, which some people may find too unrealistic to bear. Encounters with whaling ships, storms, humans, an aquarium, and a great escape are all covered. There is even some romance. I enjoyed this book but I'll be honest and state that I felt it was the author's intent to give support to the &quot;save the whales&quot; movement; it is a bit like fiction-based propaganda. (This book was first published in 1981 when the &quot;save the whales&quot; campaign was a popular environmental cause.) How anyone can read this book and not suddenly feel compelled to do something to help save the whales is beyond me. It also made me feel guilty for having visited aquariums in the past! The book has emotional parts and I did shed a few tears and at other parts I was cheering for the whales and other sea creatures. I understand the author went on to write two sequels to this story but as of yet I have not read them. Read it and form your own opinions!	2000-12-28

As an adult reading this to myself I am enjoying these tales! Contrary to what most people think these tales truly are meant for adult ears and are of interest to all ages.<br />Manheim explains that in early translations these were incorrectly labeled fairy tales and mistakenly assumed they were stories for children only. Over and over I am shocked by the gruesome content and punishments. Punishment by entrapping someone inside a barrel lined with the nail heads and then rolling them down a hill, father cutting off his daughters hands to avoid harm to himself, etc.<br />The reason I began reading these was to get a purist idea of what the Grimms' tales were: having grown up on the Disney version I was curious about the real thing. I was surprised at what I found, and happy! I was hoping to retell these stories to my 3 year-old but I have yet to find one that is tame enough to retell to him, but that is okay.<br />The storytelling nature of this is truly captured and I am entranced by these tales. The translator explains in his preface that this was the first time that the tales were translated from German to English by one person who was reading the original Grimms' manuscripts. This was first published in 1977. Manheim explains how earlier translations by other translators were muddled and errors made which changed some words, and at worst enough of the content was erroneous that the reader was really missing out on the true flavor and intent of the story. Manheim claims his edition is the most pure English translation. I compared this with my copy of the Pantheon edition edited by James Stern, as I was reading both copies at the same time. I found that the Manheim edition made more sense, that is, that some words were correctly translated to English while the other book had some words that I had just never heard of and could not understand. What fun to read these tales! Reading this book has been more fun than reading some recent fictional works.  I have a renewed interest in reading about the old folk tales and fables now. Indulge yourself and read this book!orks.  I have a renewed interest in reading about the old folk tales and fables now. Indulge yourself and read this book!	2000-12-28

It includes simple checklist tests for the parent to apply to preschool aged children to help determine if the child has SID. If the condition is suspected, then the parent may read further.<br /><br />There are chapters devoted specifically to the different ways that SID may manifest (tactile, vestibular, and proprioceptive). Symptoms are compared and contrasted with a normal sensory integration vs. a sensory integration disorder in a table format, which I found helpful. One example is a detailed account of how children react if another student bumps into them-she explains how a SID child may react (very strongly and gets upset) while the non-SID child doesn't get upset and may make a joke of it and laugh it off.<br /><br />This book is loaded with detailed information to help parents. For example, lists of behaviors associated with certain type disorders such as symptoms of low muscle tone, symptoms of visual-spatial processing, etc.<br /><br />An explanation of the differences between SID and ADD/ADHD, allergy, and Learning Disabilities and an explanation of how a child may have two or more of these conditions whose symptom lists may overlap.<br /><br />The book covers how to seek help, how to document symptoms and behaviors, and why it is important to seek help are explained. There are almost 30 pages on what a parent can do at home to help treat this condition (above and beyond getting services from health care professionals or 'experts').<br /><br />How to cope with school issues is addressed in another chapter.<br /><br />There is a chapter on the basics of the neurological system is included for reference and is helpful if parents are rusty on their knowledge of how the neurological system works.<br /><br />A glossary of terms is included and is helpful, as sometimes the author has no choice but to use neurological terms instead of layman's terms in the body of the book.<br /><br />There are ten pages of resources for parents which I feel is invaluable. There are several pages of recommended reading if one wants to learn even more. This is such a detailed and easy to understand volume.<br /><br />Clarification about this review, updated 12/27/2008: This review applies to the first edition of this book which was the only edition published at the time I read the book and reviewed it back in December of 2000. At the time this review was written this was the one and only book on the market for parents to read about SID and it was valued highly by parent-readers because it was the one source of this information that we could access in written form.

We know not where they are going. Finally it is revealed that they are going to the fair. Animals walk upright and eat cotton candy and do other human activities. All get on the train and snooze for the train ride home. I love the rhyming text, the fact that it is about a train ride, and that they are going to a fair. Trains and fairs are two of my son's favorite things so this book is a big hit in our house!<br />My only complaint that I must voice is that one rhyme is about a small baby who is crying and kicking, and baby is shown miserable with tears running down his face and mouth open, howling, and the mother is looking down and smiling proudly at the baby. I think that is a bit sick and don't think it belongs in the book. I don't like images of babies crying and portraying that as normal behavior and I especially don't like that the mother is happy and smiling while the baby is crying and not doing anything about it. Nurse that baby or do whatever is necessary to address baby's need and/or soothe the baby!  I really want to teach my children compassion and that tending to a baby's need is important. For that reason alone, I reduce my rating to 4 stars; otherwise it would have been 5.	2000-12-28

This is a simple story of a granddaughter who takes a ride on the trolley in which her grandfather is the trolley car operator. Beautiful images of the trolley ride. These were black and white photographs which had then been toned brown and then painted over with oil paints. There is a lovely blurred soft focus look to them. The little girl enjoys the ride and loves riding the trolley but most of all she loves spending time with her grandfather. Just a simple story about the ride and their relationship. Throughout the book there are sound-words such as clackety-clack and Ding gong! Ding gong! Anyone who has ridden a trolley is familiar with these sounds and will enjoy the book.<br />This book in no way is focused on actual trolleys, facts about trolleys, history of trolleys, etc. If you are a trolley buff you may be interested to know that the trolley pictured ran in New Haven, CT and bears the sign &quot;Lighthouse via Forbes Ave&quot;. The car was built by J.M. Jones Sons in 1905 and is Connecticut Trolley 838. The author notes that the photographs were taken at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine and that this trolley may be ridden there even today. The author clearly loves trolleys and mentions that his own grandfather was a trolley car operator.<br />I love the inclusion of trolleys in a beautiful picture book for young children and especially like to see a loving family relationship between grandfather and granddaughter. Applause for not making the child male which would have been more of the usual sexist pairing of boys with trains and trolleys.	2000-12-28

Contains music and words to 80 songs. There are 56 songs on the CD. Illustrations are colored-in woodcuts and charcoal sketches. Illustrations go with almost every song and include animals, nature scenes, and multicultural children who are happy and doing just about every activity from blowing dandelion seeds into the wind to playing dress-up as king and queen. Songs are well organized by subject. The &quot;chapters&quot; are: morning, play, nature, games, birthday, weather, and evening. An alphabetical index of song titles is at the end of the book. Songs that are included on the CD are clearly marked in the text. The CD is piano music with a chorus of children singing. What a wonderful resource for parents and teachers!	2000-12-28

Twelve spacecraft are featured. Lots of detail and tidbits of information are learned. My 3 year-old son is into a space phase and he sits absorbed looking at this book for up to an hour. A wonderful book to keep in the car so the child can look at this himself and be entertained while we are driving, especially on long trips. Another great use is to browse while in a restaurant. In the process of reading this I am learning a lot about spacecraft. I like the paperback edition, as it is easily portable. Paper stock is better than most and is high gloss, so it is more durable than the usual paperback book paper.  Highly recommended for the space-interested child. Despite what the publisher recommends for ages, I feel this would be of interest to 2 year-olds and up; so long as they are interested in spacecraft, it will hold their attention. Since tidbits of information are small the parent can pick and choose what to read before the child wants to move on to the next page. My three year-old won't sit while I read every single bit of text but that is okay!	2000-12-28

Our copy is dog-eared and the back cover is ripped off and that didn't take long.<br />There is one page per letter with a photo from the televison show depicting the theme of that letter (not a hand drawn or computer generated illustration or cartoon). For example: A is for all aboard and the photo is of Thomas stopped at a station. The photos are great. Every page has one sentence at the bottom that uses the word in context. I do have a complaint that each letter is only shown in the upper case. Despite much room available on the page, when the word is spelled out the first letter is in tiny font just like the rest of the letters. I would prefer if the presenting letter were a larger font to highlight its' use in the word. I was hoping to use this book as a way to teach the letters to my son and this is why I am critical of these factors.<br />With that said, any little Thomas the Tank Engine lover will absolutely love this book.<br />Some of the words are a stretch or strange (T is for tracks but then the photo shows Terence the tractor and the sentence is &quot;Terence tells Thomas about his tracks&quot;. Why not use T for Thomas (the one word the children are most familiar with), or else use Terence as he is pictured, or just say that T is for Thomas, AND Terence, AND Tracks?<br />This book has gotten us through some long car trips and air flights.<br />With all my little criticisms, I feel Iit's low cost justifies its purchase and replacement when it wears out.	2000-12-28

We are brought into Milly-Molly-Mandy's world, living with her parents, aunt and uncle, and grandmother and grandfather (and pet dog). She lives in a tiny village and has 2 best friends. We see her interacting and playing, back in these olden days of no-electricity, no-TV, no-Pokemon, etc. She is always happy and cheery and if anything these little stories are sometimes too sweet. Or maybe it is just the over-use of exclamation points that makes me think this. For example, &quot;And when they got in Father and Mother and Grandpa and Grandma and Uncle and Aunty were all sitting at table, just finishing what do you think? Why, their midday dinner!&quot; Anyway, these are lovely little stories that (I hope) any small child would love to hear read aloud to them. I especially enjoy stories that are set in times past so this appealed to me. I think that small children will need a little explanation about things because the everyday goings-on are very different then as compared to now. For example, they use candles and lanterns for night light, sew all their own clothes, make all their food from scratch, live in a thatched roof cottage, have a blacksmith (do kids even know what that is nowadays?) and shop in a tiny general store. Live is very simple in the &quot;Village&quot; and all the times are happy and gay. There is no grief, no problem that can't be overcome, nothing to fret about in this book. Illustrations drawn by the author are in black ink and wonderful. This is a chapter book not a picture book. Guidelies state this is for ages 4-8 but I feel that it is fine for any age, baby on up, so long as they are willing and able to sit and listen to a short story and not expect the large pictures of a picture book. Enjoy!	2000-12-28

Story is short and innocent. This story is nothing like the video (see my separate review of that). There is no negativity in this book, no hurt feelings, no &quot;bad guys&quot;, no threat of &quot;no Christmas&quot;,  (unlike the video). Olive saves the day: the problem is that there is a hole in Santa's sack and there are several times where toys or candy fell out of the sack and Olive helps retrieve them. A very happy little story. I recommend it for those looking for a cute, innocent modern story about Christmas. Illustrations are very unique and there is a lot going on in the illustrations. If you love the book, please preview the video before buying the video as the video is very different. If you disliked the video, give the book a chance as it is different in content and tone.	2000-12-27

Mary Azarian's wonderful black ink woodcut illustrations of life on a typical Vermont farm. Book is large and is taller than the regular hardcover book. One illustration per page with the opposite page blank. Paper is very heavy stock in an ecru color with a texture to the paper (not your regular paper or cheap paper). Both upper case and lower case letters appear at the top left corner of the illustration, about 2 inches high, which is wonderful for teaching the letters of the alphabet. The word is spelled out at the bottom of the illustration with the first letter capital and the others lower case. Examples are: Jump (in the haystack), Lamb, Pumpkin, Rocker, Stove, and Zinnia. Simple farm life is shown and the illustrations are just great! Words are simple and easily understood by the young child who is learning to read. Illustrations are so fun and large that even a toddler who is interested in farm life would enjoy them. The parent can also make up a little story about what is going on in the picture if desired because there is enough going on and/or enough to describe a little ditty about the illustration. For example: the farmer and his wife are picking apples from the apple tree at harvest time, and placing them in the basket. Maybe they will make an apple pie or cider with the apples..... (you get the idea).	2000-12-27

I thought I had read enough and educated myself enough but I was wrong. I wanted a second child but was more scared of childbirth after having gone through that bad experience. Knowing there had to be a better way, I began reading more books. I read a dozen books before and during my second pregnancy. Each book had a different twist and something to learn from. These authors make bold statements regarding childbirth issues, compared with some of the popular mainstream childbirth books. But just when I was thinking that maybe they were wrong, they cited a reference. Everything these authors state is backed up by references and is credible. The reference section that lists these studies is 34 pages long! There is a very detailed index, which is helpful.<br />One unique feature this book has is a wonderful chapter on why OB/GYN physicians do what they do. It is explained in detail how the training of an OB is medical in nature, that they are trained to look for and solve medical problems and that they are surgeons by training. This was the only book that really explains in detail why a midwife and an OB have different attitudes toward pregnancy (a medical event vs. a normal life process for a woman). The authors don't doctor-bash, but are very clear about why things happen the way they do in a hospital setting and/or with an OB as the health care provider.<br />For those interested in home birth, it is discussed and cited as the most safe for both mother and baby, and the references are there (for anyone who doubts that issue).<br />This book was so full of good information that I ended up highlighting many passages, which I usually never do (as I want to keep my books clean). To get the birth that one desires, one must know much of this information before beginning care with a health care provider. I urge anyone considering pregnancy to research the childbirth issue in the beginning. The chapter on controlling the progress of labor and pain relief is very enlightening and should be mandatory reading for all pregnant women. In the end I realized that we have to advocate for our own healthcare, by choosing a provider whom we trust and who shares the same concepts on pregnancy, labor and delivery. This book covers topics such as what your options for birth are, different types of health care providers, different types of birth settings, OB training and belief system, how to find a provider, questions to ask your provider and hospital, cesareans: why they are popular and when are they medically necessary?, getting support, the nurses role, childbirth support, doulas, and the woman's emotions. The overall tone of the book is positive and &quot;matter of fact&quot;.<br />Oh, and in the end I had the birth I wanted, a normal birth in a hospital setting, with no interventions at all, attended by my midwife, my doula, my husband, and I delivered a healthy 11 lb. 11 oz. baby boy!e in the beginning.

This book is written in a colloquial manner and reads as if the author were your best friend and you were having a conversation while sipping tea. The difference between this book and all the other homeshooling books I've read is that the author shares her personal experiences including flaws and stumbling blocks. I left the book feeling that one does not have to be a perfect person to homeschool her children effectively and that it is OK to make mistakes so long as you learn from them. Layne gives 20/20 hindsight and states what she would have done if she had known better at the time. Very interesting to see how she taught her children to read, and teach math, and how each personality was different and how she had to be flexible to the childrens different learning styles. Her list of personality traits and beliefs that one must have to be able to homeschool are wonderful. She discusses discipline and addresses effective communication methods to use with children. Of course, socialization is covered. Layne also discusses various books and materials that she has used and which she liked and which she didn't like. Layne even recommends certain toys that she feels offer educational or developmental benefits. A summary of board games and her critique is also helpful. Another not-so-commonly discussed chapter addresses preventing parental burn-out. A short chapter addressing college education ends the book. The publisher is a small company and there are a few typos here and there, and the margins are tiny (no room for note writing by the reader), but it is such a  refreshing book because it is like hearing a friend speak instead of having the tone of a cold-unhuman voice.	2000-11-25

This book is a revised and expanded edition of the original book titled &quot;Making Soft Toys&quot; which was published in 1981. The author is a Waldorf Kindergarten teacher. This book discusses the importance of play as seen through a Waldorf education perspective and explains that natural playthings from nature and toys made from natural products are important. The book opens with several essays on the subject of the value of play and the nature of (appropriate) play as seen through the eyes of a Waldorf educator. Simple toys that allow imaginative and creative play are defined as ideal and appropriate for the proper development of the child. The author states that toys made by hand are more appreciated by children and she urges parents to make toys by hand, with the child's help or the child watching. A listing of toys appropriate for different age groups is listed. Discussion about outdoor play, play with dolls, and clean up time is included. Full instructions for over 45 toys are provided. Toys include dolls and doll clothing, knitted animals, wooden playstands and cloths, wooden tree blocks, and carved wooden toys (bridges, animals, spoons, etc.). Using wool roving is explained and instructions for creating pictures with plant-dyed wool end the book. The book is 93 pages long and the instructions are detailed and illustrated with line drawings. If you enjoy crafts and want to make Waldorf-style toys, this book is a must and a good value. Of course you can buy many of these toys already made, but you would save a lot of money by making these yourself.	2000-11-24

It is a stained glass window on a grand scale, as used in Cathedrals. The author gives easy to understand directions for making tissue paper transparency decorations to hang in a window. The photos are lovely and show how beautiful tissue paper can look when light shines through it. The illustration on the cover is for what I consider to be the most difficult project in the book. There are many easier projects for the beginner to try first. Although the finished project looks complex, the projects are easy to make. Basically all that is needed is tissue paper, a handmade cardboard frame, scissors, pencil, and glue. Simple patterns are in the book and must be photocopied before use. These rose windows would make a lovely and unique gift, especially for adults. Twenty-five pages at the end are dedicated to instructions for large tissue paper scenes to hand in a window. The instructions for star money: a fairy tale scene and lantern-holding children are detailed, but once you understand the general instructions, you can make your own custom designs, such as celebrating holidays, festivals, or nature landscapes.	2000-11-24

Mr. Finser is enthusiastic and motivated and it is clear that he loves teaching and loves his students. This was a wonderful introduction to what a Waldorf education is all about. I recommend it for as the first read for parents interested in learning what Waldorf education for grades 1-8 is about. (If one is interested in Waldorf Kindergarten, I suggest &quot;Work and Play in Early Childhood&quot; instead.) This book is easy to read. I found just the notion of the same group of students staying together for so many years, and keeping one teacher as the main lesson teacher throughout was fascinating. Mr. Finser explains what is taught during each year and goes into detail about the unconventional methods used. One example is using motion-exercises to teach multiplication. We are introduced to the Waldorf-approach to artwork, circle time, music making and songs, eurhythmy (a movement exercise), and how and why myths, legends, and fairy tales are used as teaching tools. The author includes the applicable poems, myths, and fairy tales rather than simply stating that they are used in the classroom. One of my favorite sections was a collection of poems written by the students. Mr. Finser states in the preface that he will not attempt to give a lengthy description and explanation &quot;of all the dimensions of the Waldorf curriculum and the stages of child development as seen from the Waldorf point of view, or of Anthroposophy, the spiritual orientation that underlies it&quot; and he remains true to that statement. For example, a lengthy description for what eurhythmy is and why it is important is not discussed. For further information or explanation, both the author and I urge the reader to further explore the writings of Rudolph Steiner (the founder of Waldorf education) or other writings... The book closes with an essay written by Joan Almon on the subject of Waldorf education as a method of teaching creative thinking and the goals of Waldorf education.ethod of teaching creative thinking and the goals of Waldorf education.	2000-11-24

At first she is unhappy being in her bed alone at night, as she wishes she could sleep in various places in the world with the animals that live there instead. Places range from curled up with a bird in a nest to sleeping standing up in between two penguins on the ice. In almost every picture she is snuggled up with the animal. After going through various scenarios she states she is happy to be sleeping in her own bed with her blanket and pillow, and we see her sleeping with two stuffed animals and dreaming of her real animal friends. After visiting these various sleeping arrangements I expected to see her sleeping alongside her parents, as humans used to do for most of our existance on this planet, and as some cultures continue to do today. It seemed silly to me for her to have been so happy literally curled up sleeping next to a bear and a raccoon, but then at home she is relegated to sleeping with stuffed toys. I would have given this book more stars if she was shown sharing sleep with her parents which is what historically, human children have done. The illustrations are very nice and show fine details of various habitats such as under the sea and the Egyptian desert. This is obviously a good story to read to your child before bedtime especially if your child sleeps alone, or if you are transitioning from a family bed to having your child sleep alone. If you have a family bed your child may be a little confused about why the girl is sleeping all alone.Parents who enjoy books and stories about wildlife will also like this book.	2000-11-01

Text is easy to read and rhythmic because every 2 lines rhyme with each other. The words flow easily, so I disagree with some of the other reviews. Charming painted illustrations with muted jewel tones are fun to look at. The illustrations go across two pages and there is a border on the top and bottom of every page that contains little drawings relevant to the page's content. An example is that the page where the cat jumps on the fishing boat, the border has many different types of boats, from canoes to lobster boats. The page where the grey-haired woman is baking has a border of baking essentials such as butter, flour, eggs, and a measuring cup. The text reads very quickly but there is so much detail in the illustrations that much time can be spent talking about what is on the page and/or making up your own more detailed story to more closely match the illustrations. As our family travels to different places I try to purchase a children's book by a local author that is set in that location. Cat lovers and those who adore Nantucket will especially be attracted to this book.	2000-11-01

The first part of the book is about dusk and the second part is about dawn. The text is poetic and beautiful. The text is on one page and the illustrations are on the other page; this is a larger sized hardcover book. The illustrations are beautiful paintings, all with the special hues of dusk or dawn. Some of the scenes are:  the girl and dog playing in a sprinkler while bats fly overhead and fireflies fly at their feet, two fisherman on the shore of a lake, and the girl and dog taking a walk through the woods at dawn. The poetic nature of the text is rarely found in modern children's books and is a joy to read. \\"When the sky is full and singing with stars you know that twilight has given way to true night.&quot; This is a gentle and calming book to read.	2000-10-30

The book starts off in August with an elderly male farmer preparing the fields so he can plant the crop of winter wheat. The story is detailed with one or two long paragrahs on each page. The text explains the entire process of sowing, harvesting, and selling the wheat crop, in very fine detail. We learn when the seed is planted, how it is done, about the proper weather conditions necessary during various stages, etc. The man does most of the work himself, with his pet dog alongside. The illustrations are paintings and are very lovely, especially since we go from summer to autumn with the beautiful changing foliage, to winter with snowdrifts and a herd of elk trampling the wheat underfoot. The different farm equipment is seen and described in the text. Other farm animals are seen throughout the book, chickens, a cow, and wild Canadian Geese as well. The author has included additional educational information on the last page, such as the interaction between natural wildlife and winter wheat crops. This is a good book to incorporate with young children who are learning about farming or those who love big machines and farming equipment. It goes beyond some of the other toddler books that simply show a duck illustration with the word \\"duck\\" under it! For younger children or toddlers who won't sit for the entire text, the parent can easily shorten the text themselves while reading it aloud. The illustrations are so detailed and finely painted, they are a delight for both parent and child.	2000-10-30

Mother makes many guesses as to what it can be and each response is &quot;I don't need (the item)&quot;. At the end the girl pops out and declares the lump was &quot;me&quot; and then mother states that is just what she needed. This is very cute and shows love and typical interaction between a loving mother and adoring daughter. I have the board book version and I am sure it will get much repeated use. The theme of love between parent and child is not seen often enough in children's books and I am glad to see it in this book. Often books focus on the child, the child's activities, or objects (cars, trains, toys, etc.) rather than focusing on the expression and communication of love between parent and child.	2000-10-28

Funny little story about everyone taking a nap at the same time, in Grandmother's house. Before the nap is through, Grandma, grandchild, dog, cat, mouse and flea are all napping together. The illustrations change on every page to have the nappers sleeping every which way and crammed in and piled on top of each other. One by one they join the bed, then one by one they leave the bed, then the bed breaks and crashes to the floor. Very funny faces on the characters. Cute, short, repetitive text. I recommend that it be read before naps. Anyone who has napped with children and pets in the bed will especially think this is funny.	2000-10-28

A quick glance at the book shows funny farmer-dogs and the usual funny dog scenes. The text was disappointing as the story was strange and it jumped from one topic to another without a good flow. For example, it starts off with the city cousin going to visit the country cousin and the farmer cousins forget to pick up their cousin at the train station. However, when they finally find each other the question is neve asked &quot;what happened, where were you?&quot;. He finds out they were busy planting seeds but then no apology is given. These are important things for small children, to get the full flow of events and to get their questions answered, and to see simple etiquette such as a thank-you expressed. Other quirky text is saying you need &quot;the 4 W's: watering, weeding, waiting and whatever&quot;. The dogs have weird names that don't flow well off the tongue, i.e. Farmer Chundo. I didn't like the story at all. I'd rather just have my son look at the photos himself and spare me the frustration of having to endure reading the text.	2000-10-28
US	51212167	R13BFTW7ER6BOU	1869890000	356699945	The Children's Year: Crafts & Clothes for Children and Parents to Make	Books	4	85	89	N	N	A must for the Waldorf-crafter	A large sized paperback book containing directions for 112 crafts. This book was written with the Waldorf education style in mind. In keeping with the Waldorf method, the book is divided into each of the four seasons and the projects correlate with the appropriate season. Also in keeping with the Waldorf teaching style, the materials are all natural, the toys are not finely finished, there are fairies and gnomes, and natural clothing items. There are simple handcrafts for woodworking, sewing, embroidery, and knitting. Special projects for holidays and festivals are featured. Some examples are Easter  tree, willow whistle, Whitsun dove mobile, knitted baby jumpsuit, baby's felt ball, grass doll and grass horse, advent calendar, knitted finger puppets and dolls. The finished projects range from infant toys to items for the adolescent.  There are no photographs in the book, instead, illustrations are hand drawn with black ink. The most annoying feature to me, is that the projects are not dedicated to their own page. They run on and on, for example, project #21 may start at the end of page 15 and continue to page 16, then page 16 has all of project #22 and the start of project #23. I don't feel that most of these projects directly correlate to a season and are therefore very jumbled. For example, a baby rattle, a cloth basket, and dolls don't pertain to a season. The book would be easier to follow and use if the projects were categorized into sections such as toys for infants, toys for young children, sewn items, knitted items, or clothing items. The projects seem very jumbled and out of order (except for the obvious festival and holiday projects that definitely correlate with a season). If you are not a knitter or a sewer, many of these projects will be impossible to make. If you are not a Waldorf teacher, parent, or student, you may not be interested in most of these projects, for example, you may be happy buying a plastic rattle rather than making a wooden rattle by hand. If you are interested in Waldorf education and like all the kinds of handcrafts that children in Waldorf schools routinely make, you will love this book. The authors followed this book with a larger book with even more projects titled &quot;All Year Round&quot;.hand.

Mentions mannerisms and activities this busy toddler girl does throughout the day, playing, going to the library, etc. Then it mentions when Michelle was a baby and shows illustration of nursing a little newborn and states  (not in these words) that she breastfed and that milk was the only food she ever had. The text then tells how her teeth came in and how she loves to eat many foods. There is only one line that tells the reader Michelle still nurses: &quot;One thing Michelle always knew--she'll still have lots of love when her nursing days are through&quot; and shows an illustration of Michelle nursing as a toddler, and an illustration of a party, I assume a weaning party. That is all the mention of breastfeeding a toddler. I was a little disappointed as nursing was in the title and it played a tiny role in the text of the book. The subtitle of the book is &quot;a story about sharing love&quot; but really there is not much content about sharing love except to say at the end that her loved ones will always love her as she grows older. Thanks La Leche League for publishing this but I would have liked so see more images of toddler nursing because we definately don't see much toddler nursing in children's books, and anywhere else for that matter: parenting magazines and books or anywhere else! I also would have preferred a more general toddler nursing topic and included children from different families who are all nursing toddlers, different ages, several races and both genders.	2000-10-28

Indeed this is an old-fashioned country fair. But this fair is in a town populated mostly by corgi dogs, cats, rabbits, and boggarts, a fictional type of troll. This is a large format book and some of the illustrations go across both pages. Illustrations are very detailed and beautiful. It takes much more time to look at the pictures and analyze them than it does to read the text. This is set in an agricultural rural setting and the annual fair is said to be the biggest activity of the year. It is apparent this was written a while ago as a few of the characters are smoking--this is something that just caught my eye. Tudor adds some funny text that will go over the children's heads but will give the adult a laugh. I love that it is not politically correct as it mentions the Corgiville Congregational Church: modern books probably wouldn't mention religion at all. There is also a scene where the not-so-nice character feeds the racing goat lots of food and tobacco to make him sick so he can't race--today that would be painted as animal cruelty and again probably wouldn't be allowed to be printed. Anyway, it is great fun, entertaining for the adult to read and beautifully illustrated. A must have for fair lovers.	2000-10-28

The gist of the book is that one will walk among fields, woods, and the general outdoors in the autumn months and gather found objects: dead natural materials to use to make crafts with. The author does not promote cutting living plant materials from natural settings. The book is written as an instruction guide for &quot;harvest crafts&quot; to celebrate the autumnal harvest, Halloween, and Michaelmas. Items may also be used on a &quot;seasons table&quot; as in the Waldorf school style. Unlike other books in the same series, the majority of these crafts will only be able to be performed by adults or very patient older children or teens. I feel that most of these crafts need the skilled and patient hands of an experienced crafter. Only a few items would be appropriate for children to play with or handle as most of the projects are delicate in nature and would fall apart if played with with anything but the most delicate hands. Most projects are to hang on a wall or from a window or to sit on a table and not to be touched. I cannot imagine myself making some of these as they look too fine and require very perfect materials and more nimble hands than I have. The author provides excellent directions and full color photographs of the finished project as well as drawings to illustrate difficult steps in the process. Although the author states that one may use any materials that are native to an area, some of the crafts will be impossible to make unless you live in an area that has these items (unless you can find the materials in a craft store and purchase them). There are many crafts that require straw in very good condition, and seeds and nuts that may not be available in your area. Some required items are lime tree seeds, pine cones, deciduous leaves, various nuts, cereal grains (wheat, oat), and corn husks.  Here is the breakdown of the crafts: general: 3, straw items: 9, straw plait projects: 6, straw figures: 4, corn husk figures: 1, projects with materials from woods and fields: 19, project with deciduous leaves: 7, misc. items for festivals: 11. To me the most interesting looking crafts are in the festival section: instructions to make your own flower press (these can be expensive to buy in a store), writing paper decorated with leaves, window transparencies, a table transparency, and a crown made of dried leaves. I see this book being for people who love to walk amongst nature and collect little items and save them up for a time when you can make the project. The problem is that you may want to make something but be missing something such as a chestnut or a hazelnut. Or maybe you have the leaves but you have to dry them for a week before they can be used. This book is not only for the Waldorf student or parent but for anyone interested in taking natural found objects and transforming them into lovely crafts.tems: 9, straw plait projects: 6, straw figures: 4, corn husk figures: 1, projects with materials from woods and fields: 19, project with deciduous leaves: 7, misc. items for festivals: 11.

The paintings are gorgeous, in an impressionist style, soft tones, etc. What goes on in the book is more than the title implies. If you are at least observant, you are qualified to make up a story about the images. The scenes show a garden, yard, swing set, sand box, edge of the street, cherry tree and the house. There are images of the mother, I think the grandfather, grandmother, girl, boy, dog, cat, pet rabbit, baby, and the baby's doll. The people are caucasion. The people are doing different activities, and it begins in the morning, a beautiful sunny day. A sudden thunderstorm occurs, then it clears again. The people go through different activities from morning to night. I just can't get over how beautiful the paintings are. My 3 year-old son loved the book and I was able to make up simple stories about the people. With a little more imagination, I could come up with names and real characters for these people and have a more detailed story. This is a welcome addition to our home library as a break from the norm.	2000-10-26

There is a scene where the cars are going too fast and they crash and the tow truck comes to take the car to the repair shop. Until this point my 1 year-old toddler knew nothing about crashes. Immediately he began crashing his toy cars, planes, boats, trains, into each other and furniture, etc. destroying things and scratching furniture and walls in the process. (He never did crashes before and he seems to think crashes are fun and harmless.) This book basically caused us a big discipline problem! The book portrays crashes as nothing bad--and I had to try to explain that real car crashes are not fun, they are dangerous and sometimes people get hurt, etc. Other than the crash issue, I enjoy this board book. The scenes are bright, the text very sing-songy, and it is a quick read that is requested to be repeated many times. My son especially loves the repair shop which has several kinds of tools, and I am to name each one over and over. I don't think that crashing belongs in a book for one year-olds, which is the age the publisher indicates is appropriate for this book. Publishers take note: we need more books with \\"tools\\" as the main theme!<br /><br />Addendum: We've been reading this book for 5 years now and both of my sons love it. I have learned once they learn of crashing toys they never stop; I've seen it in boys other than my own as well and their start on crashing was not due to reading this book, it came from just playing with toys. My kids also love to talk about the tools in the book; it is hard to find books for toddlers with tools in them.<br /><br />My kids like the cadence of the text and they memorize it. As my firstborn got older and changed developmentally, he came to see that car crashes are not a good or happy thing. A good way to teach this is to point out accidents we pass while driving on the road or to point out smashed cars we pass in at auto repair shops. Also when we hear an ambulance I wonder aloud if someone was hurt in a car crash and that I hope they are alright and not too hurt.<br /><br />Update 12/2008: Amazon won't let me edit the star rating. I tried to change it to 5 stars to reflect my changed opinion.n we hear an ambulance I wonder aloud if someone was hurt in a car crash and that I hope they are alright and not too hurt.

We were in a rut with my 3 year-old watching too much TV and I read this book to him. It was nice to read about Mama Bear thinking the kids are watching too much TV which is what I have taken to chanting lately. It is funny to realize it is a bit dated as they reference having had a black and white TV and now their current color TV has an antenna. No VCR, DVD, TV video games, cable, or satellites are mentioned here! For that matter, computers are never mentioned either (no &quot;too much computer time&quot;). But the main theme is true: as with these Bears, our kids should be outside more, talking to their parents more, not eating in front of the TV like a zombie, and could be reading books and newspapers more, and watching the stars at night. The Bears go without TV for one week and lo and behold are happy and enjoy each other all week long. I had to laugh when Papa Bear thought he could continue watching his sports even when the Bear Kids were banned from the TV. This is all-too-much like the scene in our home! At the end, when the Kids can watch TV, they prefer crafts and toys, and even Papa Bear tires of the TV and goes fishing instead. A note: the Bear Kids go to school and homework is seen in a negative light. Time off from school is portrayed as entertainment time rather than learning time. This is a different mindset than the homeschooling family (like us) usually has.	2000-10-23

The general tone of this book is rare to find these days. The book was written almost one hundred years ago, so I guess this explains it! A sweet book full of happiness and simple pleasures. On the left side of the book, the page contains only text, and a good amount, about 12 detailed sentences, and the right side of the book is a full page illustration. An adorable story about these little root children who live and hibernate underground during the winter months and come above ground in the spring to play with the flowers and insects until winter approaches and they must return underground. The insects and the wind talk to the root children and guide them. Mother Earth is an old woman who takes care of them, puts them to sleep for the winter and wakes them up in the summer. A romantic tale that any child would love, a fantasy to think that little root children may be running about in the grasses and the forest under our feet! Illustrations are full of insects, butterflies, flowers, and various plants so the parent can talk to the child about them in addition to just reading the text. We need more books like this on the market! My only disappointment was that the book ended so soon--I wanted more, more more!	2000-10-23

This book begins with Rudolf Steiner's view of child development from birth through age 7. Not much explanation is given, sometimes just one or two sentences to  give a reason for why something is done a certain way. The author quotes Steiner a few times but I felt there was not quite enough information given and I feel some of the theories behind the actions are a little wacky and go against proven science and biology. For example, Steiner is quoted as saying the internal organs are not shaped fully until age 7 and that every exposure to external environment (parents, school, TV, radio) affects and shapes the internal organs. I learned that Waldorf schools' Kindergarten is a mix of ages 3-7. An outline of what activities are done throughout the day is covered, story time with fairy tales, song time, outdoor play and games, etc., with explanations as to why those activities are done and why they are done in a certain order. Extremely briefly described is that Waldorf schools celebrate many different seasonal festivals and Christian festivals throughout the year, and are repeated every single year. Very brief mentioning of the different drawing with beeswax crayons, painting with watercolors, using very crude/not very formed toys out of natural  materials (and why), knitting, embroidery, and woodworking. Explanation that the children are introduced to work such as cleaning, washing cloths with a washboard, and ironing. Also discussed is the general tone and environment of the class which is described as a &quot;protective mantle&quot;. I was disappointed that the topics were covered very briefly; I would have liked more detail. Seems like a big price for such a small and short book but it did give me a brief introduction to what the Waldorf Kindergarten schools are all about (no mentioning of what goes on in higher grades is written about here). I was left with wanting to know still more before I decide if Waldorf education is something that I want for my children. Currently I plan to homeschool and this book didn't give me much information on how to incorporate Waldorf principals into homeschooling, I guess I'll have to read &quot;Waldorf without Walls&quot; for that information. Lastly, I'd like to say I like the general activities that the children do in Kindergarten but just don't know if I agree with or know enough about Steiner's reasoning behind them, I will have to do more reading about Steiners' views before I can form that opinion.is written about here).

A big focus on breastfeeding as the (only real) function of the breasts. Breastfeeding portrayed in a wonderful light and the milk production process is explained in simple terms. I began reading this to my breastfeeding 1 year-old and he  loved it then and continues to love it as a weaned 3 year-old. There are many funny parts. Highly recommended to read to children who are exposed to breastfeeding and who feel breasts are a normal body part to see and know that breasts have a real and important function. Great to read to older children in preparation for the arrival of a new sibling who will be breastfed. This book is not in any way sexual or titillating and does not treat breasts as a sexual toy for adult men.	2000-10-23

I was sorry I bought it. First, there are stickers that you are supposed to put on the pages. I let him do it his way, putting things where he wanted. Otherwise I would have been too much of a dictator, saying &quot;no--put this there&quot;, etc. As you read the text you realize that the stickers only have one &quot;right&quot; place and if there is one in the wrong place the text does not even make sense. For example, the vegetables sticker is supposed to go in the helicopter's net but my son put it on the loading dock instead (which makes sense). The stickers don't stick well and my son has taken it upon himself to peel them away bit by bit, when he played with it by himself, so the book looks horrible with parts of stickers in some places. The story is nothing special and is actually quite silly. The helicopter lands down on top of a parade float onto a flat and empty base of glue (silly). He sticks to the glue and needs help getting out. The helicopters go around doing different deliveries and it ends with Budgie getting washed off as he is sticky with glue and smelly from delivering fish. This is one for the trash bin. I think this may have been related to a TV show as there is something on the back cover to indicate this but we've never seen the show itself. This is the kind of book that may appeal to the child becuase it is a familiar TV character but the book is of inferior writing and a low entertainment value.	2000-10-23

The moral issue is the girl knows that she is in the room with a wanted criminal and she decides not to turn him in. Later, she again decides not to tell her mother because she is afraid her mother will get scared. The third opportunity is when they meet up with their father and she again decides not to tell that she knows where the criminal is. The reason is that she likes the criminal &quot;as a person&quot; and thinks he is nice. The train robber told her that he robs from the rich and gives to the poor and therefore he is doing good and is a nice person, and the girl believes this, also mentioned by the robber is that the real robbers are the capitalist railroad owners. The author's note at the end again references that the railroad builders/owners were terrible people  who had a monopoly on the railroad system--rather than the train robbers being the criminal. WACKO value systems here--not what I want to teach my children. I think children should know right from wrong and that if one is in a situation with a known/wanted criminal, the child should have turned him in.	2000-10-19
US	51212167	R3SP6HX40NUOLB	014028009X	738261988	Bridget Jones's Diary: A Novel	Books	2	9	22	N	N	you may like it if single and hate your life	Frustrated single white female, very negative attitude, looking for love, drinks too much, weight obsessed even though is already thin, trying to quit smoking, hates her career. That is it in a nutshell. I might have  loved this book when I was single and so negative but now that I am a  happily married mother, and have experienced a great and happy career, I  was bored rather than entertained. Couldn't identify with the character.  Kept thinking &quot;get a life&quot; and &quot;she is so shallow&quot;.  Boring!  Novel dragged on with much of the same material over and over, not  so much drama and not anything very surprising happens to shake up the  boring-ness of it all.	2000-02-22
US	51212167	R3XJQPHN31EMN	0684841231	633333074	My Drowning	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Great writing, rich in detail, captivating	Wonderful story of a dirt-poor Southern white family. So captivating I didn't want to put it down. Easy to read. While of a depressing nature of lifes struggles, verbal and physical abuse, it was not so depressing as it  had me in tears, as often is the case with me and sad stories. This may be  in part because the character realizes the abusive behavior is not  acceptable and doesn't repeat it in her own life. Main character has a  wonderful narritive voice and it is hard to believe a male author has  captured the essence of an innocent girl so well.	2000-02-22
US	51212167	RVR29GW5YUY2W	0912500549	821583515	How Weaning Happens	Books	5	69	71	N	N	Unique book on the child-led/natural weaning process	Wonderful book whose focus is allowing the toddler to determine when he wants to wean, which is also termed &quot;child-led&quot; weaning. Explains benefits of toddler nursing and how the toddler does stop nursing when the  NEED to nurse is no longer present! Many stories and quotes from mothers  who have &quot;been there and done that&quot;--something that I especially  like. Easy to read and informative. Nice for mothers who nurse a toddler,  such as myself, to read what may be in store for us in the future and  wonder how the weaning process may go for us when that day comes. I learned  that every toddler weans in a different way. Great book on subject material  that is hard to come by despite the American Academy of Pediatrics  recommendations that breastfeeding should continue until at least 12 months  of age and beyond so long as mutually desirable by mother and child.	2000-01-23
US	51212167	R29IKYKY26OI6O	0813524083	391095077	Sisters on a Journey: Portraits of American Midwives	Books	5	12	12	N	N	overview of different types of midwives & their diversity	As a woman who knew almost nothing about the practice of midwifery, I found this a very interesting and quick read. Short chapters devoted to one midwife describe why they wanted to become a midwife, what type of midwife  they are, their views and sometimes about the politics or legal issues of  midwifery. Despite having read magazine articles on midwifery, I learned  things from this book that I've not seen elsewhere. It is also full of  affirmations that birth is normal and that women's bodies are designed for  a drug free birth--something not seen written about too often. I have one  child who was born in a hospital and had a heavy medical intervention birth  which was not the outcome that I had hoped for. I thought I had planned  well to avoid medical interventions. The knowledge I gained from this book  prompted me to seek midwifery care for my current pregnancy. I wanted to  learn more about midwifery in general and this was a fun and sometimes  disturbing read. It helped me form some of my own opinions and reaffirmed  that my decision to receive different care for my second pregnancy. For me  it was a jumping off point to then go read other books which delve more  in-depth into the topic of receiving midwifery for prenatal care and birth.  I recommend this to anyone who doesn't know much about midwifery and likes  to read stories of peoples lives. I especially liked the appendix where a  full explanation of the differences between accredition were explained and  the mission statements of the midwifery organizations were stated. The  short chapters are also easily read in bits and pieces which is necessary  when one has a toddler running about. I can't speak as to how experienced  midwives or those that already know a lot about the subject would like the  book.	2000-01-02

This book advocates spanking and other harsh punishments for a baby who merely crawls off a blanket placed on the floor for &quot;blanket  time&quot; playing. I could go on and on about the insanity of this  advice.... I defer instead to gentler books by Dr. William Sears and Marths  Sears R.N., such as &quot;The Baby Book&quot; and &quot;The Discipline  Book&quot;. If you still think you'd be interested in this book I urge you  to browse a copy before spending the money, so you can decide for yourself  what you think.	1999-08-01
US	51212167	RXZ13JCC5Q4ZE	1576734587	12194163	On Becoming Baby Wise	Books	1	2	4	N	N	The worst parenting advice I've ever seen	This is a crazy book. The scheduling is so confining that you would be unable to have any life at all. There is no room for flexibility, such as going out of the house to do errands. The strict feeding schedule is  incompatible with hungry babies. Yes, your life will change when your baby  arrives, but you can incorporate the baby into your life. I've read many  parenting books and would recommend &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by William  Sears M.D. and Martha Sears R.N. Also, for breastfeeding mothers, I caution  that by following Ezzo's recommendations for feeding scheduling, you will  in effect be reducing your milk supply and will end up with a crying,  unhappy baby. Follow the AAPs breastfeeding guidelines instead, which are  to breastfeed when the baby shows signs of hunger (not a schedule) and that  crying is a late indication of hunger.	1999-08-01
