This book is funny; I mean REALLY funny. Tim Bete is the Dave Barry for parents of young kids, so if you like to laugh, then you'll love reading this one.<br /><br />In fact, my family could tell whenever I was reading it because they'd hear my annoying, \\"HA! HA! HA!\\" from every room of the house. I couldn't put it down because it felt so good to laugh. I've decided it's a much easier route to six-pack abs than sit-ups. Just read this book and you'll get a major abdominal workout!<br /><br />IN THE BEGINNING...THERE WERE NO DIAPERS is divided into 19 short chapters that each focus on one area of parenting young children. With titles such as, \\"The Miraculous World of Potty Training,\\" \\"Five Loaves, Two Fish -- What, No Tarter Sauce?\\" and \\"Daddy's NOT going to Buy You a Mockingbird,\\" you can get an idea of how funny Bete is.<br /><br />Laughter is important for stressed-out parents. We may feel like we're the only one dealing with certain behavior issues -- single parents, especially, may have no one who can share the burden. But a book like this one helps fill in the gaps.<br /><br />This would make a great gift for any Dad - but I know moms will love it too. Bete lets you peek into his house and show you how he turns those moments of \\"Uh-oh\\" (the tooth fairy forgot to visit...) into moments of \\"Ah-ha! Close your eyes and she'll leave you a surprise\\" (It may even be money...or other unknown contents from a rapidly emptied pocket!)<br /><br />I can't tell you how hard I laughed when Tim described what it's like to change a baby's diaper in an airplane bathroom. Yes, I've done it! Most parents can relate to the strange places you're forced to do such a chore.<br /><br />And how insane we feel when we have to read the same book over and over (AND OVER) again. \\"I tried sliding it under a chair cushion,\\" he writes about his son wanting to hear The Lion King every time his wife had a prenatal visit. \\"But no matter where I hid it, it always appeared at the top of the book pile at our next visit.\\" To this day, \\"Hakuna Matata\\" sends shivers up his spine \\"as if I heard the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard.\\"<br /><br />If you're a group leader for any kind of parent organization, this book would be great to have for a break-the-ice reading or gift for new members. You'll unite every listener who has been there, done that...or is in the midst of being there, doing that.<br /><br />Although each chapter focuses on a modern parenting miracle, the biggest miracle of all will be how you can put this book down!<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester for Mind & Mediaof the book pile at our next visit.\\" To this day, \\"Hakuna Matata\\" sends shivers up his spine \\"as if I heard the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard.\\" <br /> <br />If you're a group leader for any kind of parent organization, this book would be great to have for a break-the-ice reading or gift for new members.

If you're pregnant, maybe you can relate to Dena who says, \\"As I write this, I'm seven months pregnant with our second child, and I have a confession: I don't like it! I feel like a penguin in bicycle shorts!\\"<br /><br />If you're a new mom struggling with keeping up and wondering why your emotions are all wacky, you'll be blessed by Dena's tender descriptions of her postpartem depression, when she was \\"low on sleep and high on anxiety.\\" Dena says that her passion is to \\"help women see that we're in this race together.\\"<br /><br />GRACE FOR THE RACE is divided into nine sections that relate to the various stages and emotions of motherhood: training well, warming up and stretching out, the first lap, using proper equipment, hopping over the hurdles, handing it off, in the final stretch, crossing the finish line, and on the podium.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book, she quotes a prayer from Saint Frances Cabrini, \\"Give me your grace, most loving Jesus, and I will run after You to the finish line, forever. Help me, Jesus, because I want to do this with burning fervor, speedily.\\"<br /><br />Each chapter is short, a few pages of hilarious stories from Dena's personal life. And she is such a great storyteller -- I can totally relate to everything she's describing. At the end of each section, she offers \\"Notes from the Coach,\\" which are easy-to-read scriptures from modern versions of the Bible that speak right to the heart.<br /><br />I'm going to get some copies of this book to have on hand for baby shower gifts and for mom friends who I want to encourage. It's so wonderful to read something where you feel loved and accepted for who you are, yet also challenged to be the best you can be for God.<br /><br />Dena says, \\"If you're like me, you probably feel 'stuck' sometimes. Every day, I look toward the top of Mt. Laundry, having just tackled Mt. Dishes. Taking a deep breath, I start the climb...When I feel overwhelmed in the midst of the endurance test called parenthood, it helps me to remember that I'm not alone -- other climbers have gone before me.\\"<br /><br />Reading this book is like pausing a minute to sip a cool refreshing drink, then gearing back up for the climb, knowing that you're never, never in this parenting gig alone.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester for Mind & Mediaing a deep breath, I start the climb...When I feel overwhelmed in the midst of the endurance test called parenthood, it helps me to remember that I'm not alone -- other climbers have gone before me.\\" <br /> <br />Reading this book is like pausing a minute to sip a cool refreshing drink, then gearing back up for the climb, knowing that you're never, never in this parenting gig alone. <br /> <br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester for Mind & Media <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

How can a woman accomplish all she needs to do and still grow in her relationship with God? In her refreshing book, Little Lessons from a Big God, Michelle Medlock Adams allows readers to peek into her home where she is raising two daughters, Abby and Allison. She doesn't know all the answers, but she knows a God who does, and He speaks to her while she moves throughout her daily routine.<br /><br />The book is divided into twenty quick-to-read chapters with hilarious titles, such as \\"Don't Look Behind the Chair!\\" and \\"I Was Accidentally Bad Today.\\" Each section describes an incident from Michelle's life and how ultimately she was wowed into a deeper understanding of God's love for her as a mom. She ends each story with a \\"Thought for the Day,\\" allowing readers to apply the author's lessons to their own lives. She also includes a suggested scripture reading and a short prayer.<br /><br />Since Michelle also writes fiction, her storytelling is vivid, packed with detailed images and real conversations. We feel like we're there when she feels her first pangs of labor. We laugh with her when she discovers her daughter has cut off her blond ponytail, claiming \\"Miller (the dog) did it!\\" We admire her as she handles tough discipline issues and appreciate her frankness at showing us she's not perfect, but God's grace abounds.<br /><br />Little Lessons from a Big God would make a wonderful gift for moms-to-be and women in all stages of mothering and grandmothering. It's fun and inspiring to read, filled with stories that speak to the heart, drawing us into what matters most in life and faith.  -- Heather Lynn Ivester, Christian Book Previews	2005-09-29

Yet in The Marriage You've Always Wanted, Dr. Gary Chapman shares the sobering statistic that half of all couples today will probably split up. It doesn't have to be that way, he says. Since thousands have sought him for counsel, his book captures sage advice in a concise, readable form.<br /><br />As bestselling author of The Five Love Languages, Chapman is the leading expert on what leads to unity in loving relationships. The key lies in yielding our own faults and weaknesses before the throne of Christ and asking the Holy Spirit to transform our behavior, words, and attitudes. In other words, we focus on changing ourselves, not our spouse.<br /><br />In candid detail, Chapman offers personal anecdotes from his own marriage, as well as stories that flesh out marital problems and solutions. Each chapter delves into a different aspect of marriage, such as its purpose, why people marry, the art of listening, decision making, sexual fulfillment, leaving and honoring parents, and financial planning.<br /><br />This book is a revised and updated edition of Chapman's Toward a Growing Marriage. Church libraries and marriage counselors will want this newer version. Ideally, it would make excellent reading and discussion material for couples before they marry. Yet, it offers examples and hope to couples in crisis situations, as well as those seeking to further strengthen an already wholesome marriage. -Heather Lynn Ivester, Christian Book Previews	2005-09-29

She invites readers to explore each topic with her, using personal examples from her own family and a host of others. As the mom of three adult children and a new grandmom, Kuykendall has seen the process of family-making come full circle.<br /><br />Her easy-to-read style fits right into the hectic pace of busy parents.

Couple that with toddler snacks, soccer cleats, and spelling tests. How do working moms fit it all in? In her book, All in Good Time, professional organizer Debbie Williams explains it's possible only with God's help. And it's not only possible, it's fantastic!<br /><br />The foundation of a stable work-at-home business rests on the solid footing of well-defined priorities, Williams says.

As a syndicated columnist, radio host, and seminar leader, Williams has taught thousands of women how to organize their homes and schedules to make time for what matters most.<br /><br />Through putting God first, family second, and work third, moms can learn to take control of the virtual doors and windows that demand their time and attention. Debbie offers a bounty of practical advice, along with profiles of real professionals who live out her philosophies.<br /><br />Ultimately, when setting goals and priorities, she says it's not peers or a fancy PDA that set the agenda.

This book reminds me why I can't read many novels these days. I could NOT put it down -- which is quite dangerous for me. It would have taken major surgery to detach this book from my hand. I loved it!<br /><br />I recently heard Eva Marie Everson speak at a conference, and her sparkling \\"diva\\" personality enticed me to buy her book. \\"How do two people write a novel together?\\" I was curious. \\"We each wrote three characters,\\" she said. \\"But it's a secret which ones.\\"<br /><br />What is the Potluck Club? It's a tight-knit group of six friends who get together to share a home-cooked meal, spicing things up with the latest gossip (excuse me, prayer requests.) And there's plenty to talk about in their small town nestled in the scenic Colorado mountains.<br /><br />What I love most about the book is these women are real. They're funny and flawed, but have a heart for growing in their faith. As the plot unfolds, we enter into their joys and heartaches, frowning at the naughty and smiling at the nice. And the men! The husbands, sons, boyfriends...and that nosy reporter who keeps showing up everywhere. I laughed and cried -- now, I'm hooked and can't wait to read the next one.<br /><br />It's about time Christian publishers gave us something to read that rivals best-selling chick-lit that won't make us blush! This is a novel you wouldn't mind your teen daughter or your grandmother picking up after you -- pass it on. Forget the trashy romances -- here's a piece that's good for your mind and soul.<br /><br />Ladies, if you're looking for something fun and poignant to discuss at your next book club meeting, this book is the perfect accompaniment to the staples of food and laughter. Since all the recipes are included at the back of the book, why not try some out? Are Lisa Leann's oven-barbecued brisket and cinnamon rolls really ALL THAT? Make them and see. Vonnie's Mexican Tamales will always remind you of that sad secret in her past.

Parents, this is the only book you need to get started on the most important skill they'll ever learn. And YOU can be the one to teach them!<br /><br />There are lots of fancy-schmancy phonics programs with bells and whistles -- and games and prizes and treasure chests and eight million little stickers and tiny books to keep up with. If you like all that, and need all that, then more power to you. I can barely keep up with everything else I have going on, much less a complicated method of teaching my child to read.<br /><br />Simplify your life, and just get started. For less than 20 bucks, you'll have your child well on his or her way to reading.<br /><br />OK, the title is a little misleading. It's not EASY, by any means. Especially if you have an active four-year-old boy. Let him do his lessons standing up, lying on the floor, jumping up and down the stairs, out in the yard -- he's active, and let his gross motor skills be used while he's learning. It takes 10 minutes of super-focusing -- but in between the different parts of each lesson, let your child move around. You want him to love reading!<br /><br />Also, don't feel like you have to do the writing task of each lesson. My girls love to write, so this was fun for them. But I skipped it with my son until he was more ready to hold a pencil. Actually, we did some lessons out in the driveway, with a fat piece of chalk. He had a great time and usually ended up drawing a whole train system or town after we finished his lesson.<br /><br />It works. It really does. And it's amazing to be sitting next to your child the first time they learn to read the word, \\"see.\\" Or \\"mom.\\" (\\"Mom! I just read the word 'mom!'\\" they'll say.) It's something you'll always remember doing together.<br /><br />You don't have to be a reading teacher. You don't need any special skills or experience. You read the script in red print. You stay on task. And you finish the lesson. Then you praise your child and tell her how smart and wonderful she is!<br /><br />With each of my kids, we made a VERY SIMPLE chart that had 100 squares on it. I just used a ruler and made some lines and put numbers in them -- didn't even use the computer. It took 5 minutes. Then, after we did a lesson, I let the child put a sticker over the number. Any kind of sticker. All those hodge-podge sheets of stickers you end up with -- they work great for a reading chart.<br /><br />I let each child pick a reward they wanted to receive when they finished all 100 of the lessons. That gave them great incentive to get through the whole book.<br /><br />For extra practice, I recommend the Bob Books, which you can see listed on this site. Kids love these books -- they're adorable. Scholastic makes a good set of beginner readers as well. But you don't need anything else besides this one book -- the little Bob readers can just help reinforce.<br /><br />As a busy parent, this is one of the most enjoyable things you'll ever do with your child. But don't feel like you have to rush -- do a few lessons, and if you need to take a break, then do. I highly recommend Raymond and Dorothy Moore's BETTER LATE THAN EARLY if you're the type to freak out that your three-year-old can't write his ABC's. Too many parents push their children and ruin their eyesite at a young age.<br /><br />Have fun watching the light go on!<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester, Mom 2 Mom Connectionou praise your child and tell her how smart and wonderful she is!

If you haven't read it, you need to get a copy. I didn't buy this book for myself; it was a gift from someone who knows I get overwhelmed at times trying to manage a home business as well as a busy household. (What to do about thousands of emails! What to do about 80 million exciting projects I want to get involved with! What to do about getting kids' school papers organized! What to do about supper!)<br /><br />I've read tons of books on getting organized, but I can say this one is the grand finale. Here's what I used to do: make a daily to-do list that I think about all day. Worry about the things I didn't get around to doing. Talk about how worried I am about the things I need to do. Then go to bed discouraged, transferring my to-do list to another day.<br /><br />Forget this system. It doesn't work, and it makes you one stressed-out person. Especially if you're a mom, and you can't accomplish all the things you know you COULD accomplish if it were just you. You've got a house full of people and pets and projects and plans that interrupt your goal-setting and list-making.<br /><br />David Allen's system is a beautiful thing. Don't throw away your leather calendar, your Blackberry, or PDA -- whatever it is that you use -- keep it. Just use your calendar to record those events that must be etched in stone: work deadlines, doctor appointments, birthday parties, soccer games, the day you're supposed to bring a meal to someone, etc. You'll need your calendar for those things. But DON\\"T use it to make a to-do list.<br /><br />First of all, you've got to process all of your STUFF and start thinking in terms of in-box. Allen says the reason why people are stressed out is because there are so many \\"open loops\\" in their lives -- things they mull over that aren't complete. Instead, you need to think in terms of \\"What's the next action?\\" Make a list of your projects, and put it into a folder, labeled \\"Project list.\\" This includes anything that is an open loop that you need to get done.<br /><br />Next, take a single sheet of paper for each open loop and write \\"Next action\\" at the top. So, instead of writing, \\"Tires\\" on your list when your car needs new tires, you'll write the steps you need to do. 1) Call Fred who knows the good place to get new tires. 2) Call tire place and check out prices 3) Make appt. 4) Drop car off to get new tires. Using this method allows you to completely free your mind because it's all written down, allowing you to have a \\"mind like water.\\"<br /><br />What works well about this Next-Action technique is that you can make productive use of minutes here and there throughout the day when your energy or concentration may not be at their maximum. If you're stuck in the carpool line, make a few calls on your cell phone (but DON'T waste time talking on your cell phone when your kids are in the car! Talk to your kids! That's my personal pet peeve when I see parents ignoring their kids to talk on their cell phone...)<br /><br />Allen says, \\"This is one of the best reasons for having very clean edges to your personal management system; it makes it easy to continue doing productive activity when you're not in top form.\\"<br /><br />What's the end result? The author says, \\"When people with whom you interact notice that without fail you receive, process, and organize in an airtight manner the exchanges and agreements they have with you, they begin to trust you in a unique way...It noticeably enhances your mental well-being and improves the power of your communications and relationships, both personally and professionally.\\"<br /><br />The ultimate goal of this incredible system is that your mind is freed up to do what you REALLY love to do, and that is THINK. Don't most of us wish we could just FOCUS when we want to without our minds jumping around to the meat we've got to thaw, the vet appointment we need to make, the errand we forgot to run, etc.? YES!<br /><br />Well, I've oversimplified things to write this review. Just get the book and read it. Allen also has an active website where you can find a helpful community of people all implementing this system. What I liked most about the book is that Allen says it's the brightest, most imaginative people who really struggle -- because we think of all the possible outcomes and we freeze our agendas. Using his techniques to \\"do it, defer it, delegate it, or drop it,\\" we can forge ahead.<br /><br />Enough said.

My copy has been loaned and returned several times, and I've filled the margins with stars, exclamation points and amens!**! I'm so extremely thankful Mrs. Farris and her daughter took the time to write it.<br /><br />If anyone has doubts about children being able to be properly educated at home, they need look no further than this book. It was written almost entirely by Mrs. Farris' second daughter, Jayme, who was only in her early 20s at the time of publication. As I read it again recently, I was simply amazed that a young woman could capture the wisdom and experience of her mother, and what a joy it must have been for them to work together on this project.<br /><br />I can't understand the other reviewers who write negatively about this book. The title is absolutely perfect! It's not supposed to be a practical how-to guide; it's a journey, a very personal peek into the life of a large, successful homeschooling family. Mrs. Farris bravely tells the story of how she came to be a mother of ten children and why they chose to homeschool.<br /><br />I've heard Michael Farris speak before, and I too wondered what kind of a woman could possibly mother and teach ten children. So that's why I bought the book to begin with. Mrs. Farris writes, \\"I am a very normal mom who happens to have a very visible, talented, and energetic husband...I struggle regularly with feeling overwhelmed...A super-mom could certainly write her own book! I am very much a mom like you. And from one normal mom to another, let me just tell you that God is faithful...\\" (Her husband is a successful attorney, the founder of the Home School Legal Defense Association, founder of Patrick Henry College, professor, author of several non-fiction books and novels, and has won many awards.)<br /><br />The theme of her whole story is that God alone can enable and give grace for a person to accomplish anything. Mrs. Farris grew up as a shy, only child who had little practice in domestic arts or caring for children. She even admits that she is a \\"scaredy cat\\" when her husband is away traveling. Yet she uses her weaknesses to draw on God's strength.<br /><br />The book encompasses her journey of child-bearing, beginning with the birth of her first daughter, and ending with her new role as grandmother. She goes into great detail about how she and her husband made the decisions that led them along this path. It made me see how powerful information is to women in their child-bearing years. While listening to a Focus on the Family radio show, she became interested in homeschooling. Later, it was through reading a magazine article by C. Everett Koop as well as Mary Pride's book, The Way Home, that she decided to relinquish control over planning her family size.<br /><br />The whole book is funny and encouraging. We see her youngest Peter jumping off the coffee table. We agonize with her as she is planning a wedding while still taking care of a child in the middle of the night. We see how her daily afternoon walks help her stay sane and refreshed.<br /><br />She explains the Farris' principles of child-rearing, mainly \\"our ultimate goal is to not to raise children, but to raise adults.\\" She discusses the delicate balance between rights and responsibility as children move through different ages. This wisdom is so helpful for moms in the trenches with young kids (like me). I can't personally talk to Mrs. Farris about why her kids turned out so well, but I can read her philosophy and reasoning, and it makes me want to trudge onward and upward, never losing hope.<br /><br />The last two chapters are extremely inspirational, and for anyone who is planning a mother/daughter speech or tea, these chapters offer you great ideas. She quotes another of my favorite authors, Elisabeth Elliot, who says, \\"None of the gifts of my own life -- not my \\"career\\" or my work or any other gift -- is higher or more precious to me than that of being someone's mother.\\"<br /><br />The high calling of being a mother is precious indeed.

It's been years since I've had a formal course in marketing, and even then, I wouldn't have learned about persuasive writing for the web. So this book was great for me, and I highly recommend it for anyone who is developing a personal or business website.<br /><br />The whole book is a series of two- to three-page articles that can be read systematically. The authors are witty and passionate about teaching you how to write copy that converts visitors toward an action.<br /><br />What's the single most important factor in getting your prospects to convert? Be relevant. \\"Relevance is a measure of how closely search results match the search request.\\" If you follow the techniques the authors describe, your words won't waste the readers' time and will have impact.<br /><br />The chapter, \\"Writing in Review\\" is a super-condensed Strunk and White's for the corporate writer. It covers all the basics. The authors conclude, \\"Stellar writing begs to be read. There is an urgency to the writing that keeps the reader going, even when that reader might be pressed for time.\\"<br /><br />Who isn't pressed for time? People on the internet are in a hurry. They need to find out a piece of information quickly. If your site is too flashy, slow to download, or your words don't make any sense, you'll lose their interest. They can go someplace else. This is what you DON'T want to happen.<br /><br />The authors include great examples of site makeovers, showing you what works and what doesn't. For me, it was a great introduction to Nick Usborne, and I've gone on to read his book, NET WORDS. They also pointed me toward Ogilvy, another master of advertising.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the chapter on using poetic techniques to improve copy. \\"You won't snag or woo your customers with drabness; you'll woo them with skillful wordsmithing that penetrates their souls...\\" What follows includes techniques such as frosting, franking, seussing, and frameline magnetism; also, how to develop pace, rhythm, and poetic meter.<br /><br />It's a short read, but full of insight. For anyone who ever wondered how business communication could be seen as a satisfying creative outlet, look no further than this book.

Before I read Jacob's book, I thought I might learn a few techniques for writing restaurant reviews. Wow -- I was wrong! This is a huge, magnificent field, of which I've merely sampled my first appetizer.<br /><br />The author's research in compiling this book is extensive. In presenting her ideas, she doesn't limit readers to her own personal experience; she interviewed hundreds of successful food writers and asked them how they got started, what a typical day is like, and what advice they have to give.<br /><br />Despite her years of industry experience, Jacob truly understands the heart of a beginner, and her voice is as far from snooty-hooty as one can be. Readers will feel encouraged and energized after reading chapters on the secrets of restaurant reviewing, cookbook compiling, recipe writing (yes, it is an art form!), memoir and nonfiction food writing, and food in fiction.<br /><br />Jacob's passion is so contagious, her words dance across the page. She seems especially interested in the trend of narrative food writing, and she gives you tips on how to make your writing full of jolt and flavor. What are the three laziest adjectives used to describe food? She says \\"nice,\\" \\"wonderful,\\" and \\"delicious.\\" She writes, \\"They are so vague that readers don't know what you mean other than something positive.\\" Instead, she offers an extensive list of adjectives in chapter 5 that make it well worth the price of the book.<br /><br />I'm only a simple home cook. My creativity usually involves whipping up kid-friendly favorites without having to dash off to the grocery store for exotic ingredients. Although I've written a few of my own recipes, I certainly didn't realize what an exciting art form food writing can be.<br /><br />While reading this book, we ate out at a new restaurant, and I imagined myself as one of those fancy New York Times reviewers in disguise (didn't know they may actually wear wigs!). I had our waiter answering a myriad of questions, and even dashing back to speak with the chef. I brought home a menu and scribbled all over it my impressions.<br /><br />I'm intrigued as to how to better describe tastes and food. And I never considered children's books to be a place where good food writing can exist. After reading WILL WRITE FOR FOOD, I am much more aware. I appreciate the recommendation from Writer's Digest and will certainly add this to my bookshelf of favorites.<br /><br />I love the way she describes what it takes to make a great reviewer: [They] have passion, knowledge, authority, a great writing style, and stamina...They give the reader a feel for the place, its rhythm, and overall vibe. And they keep up their energy level and enthusiasm. Passion is paramount.\\"<br /><br />She quotes experienced food critic Alan Richman who says he can't wait to see what a restaurant has in store for him. He shares, \\"I get a hop in my step.\\"<br /><br />A well done book, indeed.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivesterh the chef.

If you're in any type of business, you've got to understand what your customers want. And since women make 80% of the major purchasing decisions, you need to think about what your company can do to meet women's needs. Especially savvy mom shoppers. Their pocketbooks represent a $1.7 trillion market.<br /><br />How can you think like a mom if you're not a mom? You can't, unless you're willing to research.<br /><br />That's where Bailey and Ulman's book comes in. They've done all the work for you. From cover to cover, you'll read hundreds of case studies and research examples that prove the authors' expertise in the field of marketing to mothers.<br /><br />If you're a 50-year-old male executive sitting in a high-rise boardroom designing a marketing plan, you have no idea what the buzz is among moms on the playground. Word-of-mouth can spread news about a product like wildfire.<br /><br />I can't say enough great things about this book! I was completely fascinated with their studies of generational differences. There are four generations of mothers out shopping today: Silver Birds (born between 1935-1945); Baby Boomers (1946-1964); Gen X (1964-1976); and Gen Y (1977-1994). The older generations are grandmothers out shopping for their children and grandchildren, while the newest wave of moms are just entering their child-bearing years.<br /><br />The authors write, \\"Although it is true that all moms are women, not all women are moms, and expecting to connect with a mom as you speak to her only as a woman is a well-documented misnomer...By ignoring her role as a mother and just speaking to her as a woman, you are essentially subtracting from the equation the role that she values most.\\" In a nutshell.<br /><br />The book explores each generation's way of thinking and shares the interesting discovery that it's not the mother's age that links her thinking to her peers; it's her child's age. So, you could have a Boomer mom and an X generation mom with kids the same age, and they'll have more in common than peers without children or with kids in a different age group. I've found this to be true in my own life, and it made sense seeing this fact in print.<br /><br />What's the one thing that moms really want? Read the book. If your product can meet that need, you'll more likely win her over. How has technology changed the shopping experience for moms? The authors won't just tell you -- they'll SHOW you through detailed case studies.<br /><br />Bailey and Ulman will also share their views on why certain products do well in the mom market and why others fail. They describe several successful marketing campaigns, as well as some doozies. For example, Ziplock bags realized what a struggle it is for moms to pack up snacks for their kids when they're on the go, and they designed a marketing strategy to show mothers they understood. It's like the authors say, \\"If you want to think like a mom, you have to walk in her shoes.\\"<br /><br />The biggest take-away I got from the book is that mothers today value information more than any other time period. The average mom reads 4.1 magazines a month, so this is where we're getting a lot of information. Products that meet women's needs for information will have the best advantage in the marketplace. And this increases the value of good public relations over traditional advertising.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone. It's fun to read through, but it's definitely a great reference tool to keep nearby. Bailey is CEO of her full-service marketing firm, BSM Media, and Ulman is principal of the Haystack Group, a communications and consumer research consultancy.

I wish I could have read it years ago when I was in college, laboring through my English major, taking myself way too seriously. It should be required reading for everyone who is fascinated with words on a page.<br /><br />It's the kind of book you keep along beside your dictionary and thesaurus, and whatever else you keep as a reference. It helps just knowing that Anne is there, between the pages, poking fun at you as you agonize over a first draft. You look at her book cover, and you know what she's thinking, what she'd tell you if she were sitting beside your computer.<br /><br />\\"Writing a first draft is very much like watching a Polaroid develop. You can't -- and, in fact, you're not supposed to -- know exactly what the picture is going to look like until it has finished developing,\\" she writes.<br /><br />Before I read BIRD BY BIRD, I always had this fear of getting started with a story. Well, I guess I still do, but at least I know Lamott's take on it. I love research, gathering information and quotes. I love talking to people about what they're passionate about, people I interview for a story. And the books! And underlined sentences! And articles and papers and poems and scriptures and movies and spilled cups of coffee. Just one more thing, I tell myself. Then I'll start...<br /><br />After reading this book, I know it's okay to feel that way, but the way to write is just to get something on paper. At some point in life, you have to move beyond your private journal to connect with an audience because there's someone out there who may understand you, and you'll never know if you don't try.<br /><br />Lamott tells her writing students on the first day of class that \\"good writing is about telling the truth.\\" She says \\"an author makes you notice, makes you pay attention, and this is a great gift. My gratitude for good writing is unbounded; I'm grateful for it the way I'm grateful for the ocean. Aren't you?\\"<br /><br />That's all we can do as writers, is to keep trying to tell our versions of the truth, as we move around in our little worlds surrounded by the Truth.<br /><br />The title of the book, BIRD BY BIRD, came about from an episode in her brother's life. He'd put off starting a report on birds, which was due the next day at school. Surrounded by books, paper, pencils, and \\"immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead,\\" her brother had sunk into despair. Then Anne's father sat down next to him, put his arm around her brother's shoulder and said, \\"Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.\\"<br /><br />That's a magnificent philosophy for anything, for life. Take it slowly, one step at a time. I think I could sit here and quote every page of this book, but if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go start reading it through again.<br /><br />(Thank you, Lauren, for telling me about it!)<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester<br /><br />P.S.

I heard about this book from several different places; some people love it, others don't. These polarized views are likewise reflected throughout readers' opinions here.<br /><br />I have to say, the first half of the book was extremely slow-going for me. I'm used to reading quickly, at least two or three books a week. I read, I absorb, then I move on. The prose in this book was excruciatingly slow for my taste, yet I gradually realized Robinson was pulling me in this way on purpose. I began to slow down, step by step, until I too was in the shoes of Reverend John Ames living in the late 50s in Gilead, Iowa. The pace of life for him was also quite slow, especially as he wrote this long letter to his son, while his heart began to give way.<br /><br />At first, I didn't like her style of telling instead of showing. There was little dialogue, and it seemed to me the narrator was rambling too much. Then I realized the narrative in the beginning spirals through Ames' memories to set us up for the present-day action that takes place in the second half of the book. The true plot centers around what to do about Jack, his best friend's son who is named after him.<br /><br />As we read, we sense John Ames' bitterness -- his first wife and newborn daughter died in childbirth, he was a lone widower for most of his adult years, and finally married and became a father to one child in his 70s. Now he is dying, and won't be able to live to see his son grow up. Yet in exploring his past through writing his memories, we discover his acceptance of the gospel of grace, in all its terrific, noble beauty.<br /><br />The ending is a complete surprise, and for me, was an \\"Aha\\" moment as to why the book won the Pulitzer. Of course the critics were pleased. Still, it's not the plot that makes the book memorable, it's Robinson's poetic voice. For example, the Reverend writes, \\"Sometimes I have loved the peacefulness of an ordinary Sunday. It is like standing in a newly planted garden after a warm rain. You can feel the silent and invisible life. All it needs from you is that you take care not to trample on it.\\"<br /><br />Do I recommend this book? It depends. If you can get away to a quiet place and read the book all at once, you may love it. But if you have to read a bit here and there, it can be frustrating, even maddening. Still, if you're forewarned about what to expect, you'll be prepared that this book is different.<br /><br />Yes, it's all about fathers and sons, which is about as universal a theme as one can get.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivesterometimes I have loved the peacefulness of an ordinary Sunday.

Each day, we make hundreds of decisions that add up to who we are, what we value, and where we're headed. While it may seem that only the big decisions matter, this book will cause you to think more deeply.<br /><br />If God cares about the small things in life, like the tiniest sparrow, then we should too. It does matter whether we toss a ball one afternoon with our son or tell him, \\"Not now, I'm busy.\\" It does matter if we're honest, when a little white lie would be so much easier. It's the details that add up to create our legacy.<br /><br />I'm so glad I read this book when I did. It's the perfect companion to THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE. I admit, it's exciting to find that long-term passion or goal. A renewed purpose can make us think we've got a vision that's unstoppable. But sometimes there are little things, little moments and people that seem to be in our path.<br /><br />They ARE the path.<br /><br />In YOUR UNFORGETTABLE LIFE, authors Chapin and Schuchmann give readers great examples of famous and ordinary people who left their legacies, their imprints on the generations that followed them. This book is packed full of great stories that demonstrate the truth that a person's legacy is the result of a lifelong faithfulness in the small things.<br /><br />Some historical examples include the different legacies left by the families of Max Jukes and Jonathan Edwards. Both lived in the late 1800s in the northeastern part of the U.S. Throughout their lives, they made decisions that left an impact on thousands of their descendents. In the case of Jukes, his unwise choices have left behind generations of poor decision makers who've ended up living in poverty, imprisoned, or in ill health. In contrast, many of Edwards' descendents have become physicians, authors, college professors, lawyers, and congressmen.<br /><br />The book is fun to read, as it is also full of modern examples of the authors' day-to-day choices, and how they affected those around them. Each chapter explores a different issue relating to how our lives are unforgettable. How we spend our dollars adds up to our financial legacy. How we spend our minutes demonstrates what our priorities are. The words we choose spill over from what's going on in our hearts.<br /><br />I love how the authors offer hope to readers that it's never too late to start living a life that matters. Even if readers have inherited unhealthy habits or lifestyles, now's the time to start making one tiny decision that leads to a better future. And that decision will matter for all of eternity.<br /><br />This is a book to be savored slowly and reread from time to time. The path that is straight and narrow is actually full of freedom. It would make a helpful guide for youth workers or a gift for singles or couples of all ages. As the authors write, \\"If we want a legacy that lasts, if we want to be remembered, we must give people something to remember. We should think of our lives as stones thrown in a pond; the ripples go out long after our stones sink.

Yes, these items are necessary for establishing a household, but what they may need more than anything is a book like this one.<br /><br />Ellie Kay's THE DEBT DIET takes a difficult topic (one we'd rather not think about) and provides a humorous analogy to that of shedding unwanted pounds. Ms. Kay writes, \\"Getting out of debt is like going on a diet. What do you do if you want to lose weight? You eat less and exercise more. This sounds simple, but most of us know it sure isn't easy...The way to get out of debt is much the same -- the only thing that really works is to spend less and save more.\\" (And I would add -- try to earn more, even if you have to go back to school or study at home to qualify for a higher-paying job.)<br /><br />Her book is based on years of personal experience and extensive research. Known as America's Family Financial Expert, the author interviews frequently for TV and radio. Her financial columns appear in several national magazines -- so her advice is never stale. She's also a mom of seven kids who knows the long-term effects parents' financial habits have on children.<br /><br />Get this book. Read it through cover to cover. Then set it aside a while and let her advice percolate through your thinking. In time, you can pick it up again with a notebook and start planning concrete ways for applying her ideas.<br /><br />I love all the quizzes, charts, and graphs in the book. They're fun to read and make the text visually stimulating. Her chapter on how to calculate your FICO score was amazing -- especially her personal anecdotes of ways she's picked up to improve scores.<br /><br />While this is a book for anyone, women readers who are also household managers will especially benefit from her tips on becoming financially savvy.

If it is true that the best gifts come in small packages, then reading this book will be like unwrapping more than two hundred small gifts that are filled with extraordinary inspiration.\\"<br /><br />The book is divided into thirteen topics, making it quick and easy to look up what you need. These subjects include: faith, growing deeper and stronger, God and His Word, worship and praise, prayer, marriage, family, community, success, wisdom, virtue, comfort for tough times, and eternal hope.<br /><br />Here, you'll find the words of many well-loved Christian personalities in one concise reference manual. The acknowledgement section in the back attributes the lists to their original sources, which may lead to your further research on topics of interest.<br /><br />But when you've got only a few days or hours to stand up and give a devotion or sermon, you may not have time to research in-depth -- that's where a book like this can be put to good use. You can drive home your point attributing it to an expert to further capture the attention of your audience.<br /><br />Some of the authors included in this book include Max Lucado, John Piper, Jonathan Edwards, Charles Stanley, Charles Swindoll, Billy Graham, Anne Graham Lotz, Dennis & Barbara Rainey, Steve & Mary Farrar, Charles Spurgeon, Bill Gothard, St. Augustine, Barbara Johnson, Rick Warren, James Dobson, and Stormie Omartian.

I know the color of the font matches the covers, and it does indeed look beautiful, but I hope my small plea may make someone aware of this problem. I look at this book far less than I would if it were printed in much more readable type.	2005-07-22

Every year, someone comes up with a new spin on the age-old question of how to stay fit. When I was growing up, we dutifully memorized our four food group chart, which was later replaced by the food pyramid. I was shocked to learn recently that the food pyramid wasn't based on true scientific research, but on government subsidy politics. So, once again, we're told to learn something new.<br /><br />Thankfully, one book never changes: the Bible. That's why Dr. Rex Russell's book should be on every parent's bookshelf: it serves as a companion to God's Word, explaining in laymen's terms how to eat based on the Creator's plan. And it's chock full of warm and witty anecdotes from Dr. Russell's research and life work.<br /><br />Despite our massive improvements in sanitation, nutrition, and medical research, studies show the average American's lifespan could DECREASE by as much as five years in the coming decades. Why is that? It's because we eat too much, eat the wrong things, and we're too FAT! More than 60% of adults and 30% of children are overweight or obese, putting themselves at a higher risk of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and a variety of other illnesses.<br /><br />WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT HEALTHY LIVING is based on three simple principles: 1) Eat the foods God created for you. 2) Don't alter God's design. 3) Don't let any food or drink become your God. This book also has a chapter on fasting, which is a topic everyone needs to understand. You see examples of it throughout the Bible, but how many of us actually practice it habitually?<br /><br />Dr. Russell tells the case of a nine-year-old girl with severe dyslexia who was undergoing expensive therapies and treatments, yet still couldn't read. The surprise came after she fasted a few days from having the flu. She could read! Her parents discovered her learning problems were diet-related. They learned she was sensitive to sugar, corn, white flour, margarine, honey, and other frequently eaten foods.<br /><br />I think many kids who are diagnosed with ADD and other disorders could be cured through cutting processed food out of their diets and getting hours and hours of fresh air and exercise outside instead of being forced to sit still indoors. Easier said than done, of course. But it's still a lifestyle to aim for.<br /><br />This is a book I bought on the recommendation of Sue Becker of the Bread Beckers in Atlanta. I try to read it once a year to remind myself of the health truths found in the Bible. It's a staple to add to every mom's shelf of cookbooks -- and gives hope to those suffering from health problems. I also like George Malkmus' Hallelujah Diet and books, though eating a mostly raw diet is tough when trying to feed kids. Still, it is something to keep in mind, and it's a diet that is Biblically based and has cured thousands from severe disease.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivesterfoods.

Women in all seasons of mothering long to feel the support and camaraderie shared with others strolling the same well-worn path.<br /><br />KISSES OF SUNSHINE does just that. It's filled with dozens of stories that make you smile, burst out laughing, and even cry. And don't we love a book that makes us feel like life is actually a wonderful thing?<br /><br />I took this book with me to the beach, tucked into my humongous tote bag full of kiddie toys, snacks, and sandy toddler flip-flops. This was something just for me! And I savored every word. I loved reading the labor-and-delivery stories -- reminding me of my own sometimes harrowing experiences. This book would be a great gift for expectant moms!<br /><br />You know, when you read a story on the internet or in a magazine, and you think, \\"This is so good. I've just got to send it to somebody.\\" That's exactly what this book is -- a collection of those favorites, all bound into a beautiful, hardback book. And best of all, each story points the reader toward a deeper awareness of God's love for moms, ending with a scripture that ties it all together.<br /><br />I was cracking up reading about Ellie Kay's homeschooling day with a mouse on the loose! And oh no -- what Jill Gregory discovered in the bathtub! Gardeners will love Anne Denmark's story about trimming roses and watering lilies in a place where she never feels alone. Carol Kent's letter from her mom in \\"A Treasured Letter\\" made me want to get out my stationery and write notes to those I love. You'll want to do the same.<br /><br />With titles such as \\"Did I really say Drug Free?,\\" \\"Keeping the Groom -- Dumping the Dress,\\" \\"Girls' Day Jammin'\\" and \\"A Tale of Two Manicures,\\" there's something for every woman to enjoy. This is a book that makes you want to take off your shoes, kick back, and enjoy the warmth of a room full of wonderful storytellers.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester	2005-07-21

You think you may even have a book in you. You talk about it with your friends and family, and they tell you it sounds amazing. Now what?<br /><br />Weeks pass. Months go by. Maybe even years. That idea just won't go away! So, finally you sit down at your computer and begin typing it out. You become engrossed in your topic -- swamped in research, personal anecdotes, and fresh twists on age-old issues. You're convinced every publisher will be clamoring for your book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if you send your masterpiece out without a bodyguard (an agent), it may end up in a tottering pile of manuscripts in the corner of an editor's office. Or worse -- it may not even make it to his desk because a first reader deemed it inappropriate for the publishing house.<br /><br />Never fear. That's where Terry Whalin's book will save you the months and years of heartache as you turn your passion into print. He explains, \\"Many writers focus only on the creative aspects of writing a book and getting it published, but the executives inside a publishing house are business people who want to sell books and turn a profit at the end of the day. It's a delicate balance between creating the best possible product and assuring that each product has the best opportunity to sell into the market and reach the target audience.\\"<br /><br />BOOK PROPOSALS THAT SELL is your road map for bypassing the long, winding route that gets you nowhere and shows you the shortcuts for learning what publishers are really looking for. The author explains that more than 80% of nonfiction books are first sold as proposals. How can you capture an editor's interest? Where should you start?<br /><br />The 21 secrets in this book will teach you what really goes on behind the closed doors of an editorial meeting. And they obviously work -- since Terry Whalin has published over 60 nonfiction books and also works as an acquisitions editor. His personal web of stories spun from a career in the publishing world make the book a dynamic read. And it's fun to learn about all the goofy stuff people do to try to get their foot in the door. (Yes, you get all the nitty-gritty details...Like the one about the writer who wanted to know if she could have a response over the weekend!)<br /><br />What makes this book truly worth the money is that it's only a springboard into the topic of book publishing. It's filled with up-to-date websites that will further your education. Want to see a sample proposal that sold for six figures? It's in there. Want to see a list of agents, hear which conferences are the best, or learn about book marketing? Having this book will save you hours of surfing the web because you'll receive the author's list of the very best sites.<br /><br />If you're planning a trip to a new place, you wouldn't dream of going without a map. And writing a book is a journey with the destination of getting your ideas into the minds of your readers.

She led a seminar at a university near our home several years ago and was one of the most entertaining speakers I've ever heard. Though her topic of home organization does not normally lend itself to being humorous -- just let Deniece get started on how much clutter corn on the cob creates -- she made the prospect of deep cleaning seem like fun.<br /><br />I'm sure I've saved our family thousands of dollars just from attending that one seminar. She gave us her philosphy of living on less -- we don't need all the gadgets and gizmos people try to sell us. Those items you think you can't live without are going to have to be stored somewhere, eventually.<br /><br />Her long-term advice: keep life as simple as possible.<br /><br />The great thing about her book is she REALLY is an expert. She uses all these fancy terms that make homemakers feel like we're really CEOs of small corporations. (And we are!) But now I can recite exactly which technique I'm using when I clean house. Her six work simplification techniques are priceless:<br /><br />1. Think before you act.<br />2. Discard and sort.<br />3. Group.<br />4. Be motion-minded.<br />5. Accrue your benefits.<br />6. Preventive maintenance.<br /><br />Read the book to find out what each means. All I can say is that \\"preventive maintenance\\" is a lovely term to have in your mind as you get your kids to keep their STUFF out of the family room.<br /><br />The first couple of chapters build a foundation upon which her philosphy of family organization rests. Basically, she gives you reasons why you're not doing anybody favors by doing all the work yourself.<br /><br />Her mantra of planning and scheduling make this book a must-read. She commiserates with overwhelmed homemakers by saying, \\"One of the big problems with housework is that it's never done. You can work for hours and hours and never feel like you've accomplished anything. But a schedule eliminates those feelings of frustration by giving you a stopping point. The work may not be finished, but YOU are.\\"<br /><br />The book is full of drawings, detailing her ideas, and would be a great gift for a new bride, new mom, or someone you know who is moving. In fact, she has a whole chapter on the art of moving peacefully -- yes, it can be done.<br /><br />I can't say it better than a quote she borrowed from Winnie the Pooh's pal, Christopher Robin: \\"Organizing is what you do before you do something, so that when you do it, it's not all mixed up.\\"<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn IvesterU are.\\"    The book is full of drawings, detailing her ideas, and would be a great gift for a new bride, new mom, or someone you know who is moving.

Gilliand<br /><br />How many parents enter the library or bookstore and stand there overwhelmed, staring helplessly at row upon row of titles unknown? So many books, so little time to choose what's best. Add to that the pressure that advertisers place on families: kids want to read what's new and fun, and prominently displayed in book club catalogues.<br /><br />The temptation to let your kids choose what they want to read can be irresistible. It's the same with meals: how many kids beg for steamed broccoli over chocolate chip cookies? If we let our kids read only what they choose, they may never discover the wealth of outstanding books that are beyond their present tastes.<br /><br />That's why Gladys Hunt's book, HONEY FOR A CHILD'S HEART, is a classic that should be underlined and dog-eared on every parent's bookshelf. The present edition has been revised four times since its first printing in 1969. Now the author can boldly say, \\"The book has been in print long enough to have its influence affect the second generation of children.\\" The feedback she has received from happy readers over the years is proof her ideas and book lists make a difference.<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts. You'll want to read part one slowly, savoring her ideas on how books influence the hearts of young readers. The author writes, \\"Children and books go together in a special way. I can't imagine any pleasure greater than bringing to the uncluttered, supple mind of a child the delight of knowing the many rich things God has given us to enjoy. Parents have this wonderful privilege, and books are their keenest tools.\\"<br /><br />The second section of the book contains Hunt's \\"Best-Loved Books for Children: Books Your Children Should Have the Opportunity to Enjoy.\\" Here are the meat and potatoes (or should I say fruits and vegetables?) that should be staples of your child's literary diet.<br /><br />The annotated list is divided up into age groups: first books for ages 0-3, picture book classics for ages 4-8, first books for beginning readers, classic children's novels for ages 9-12, great books for young adult readers, and poetry recommendations. She also includes a list for holidays and other themes.<br /><br />Although her book can't possibly include every great children's book ever written, it's a start.

What a fabulous place to sell inspirational gift books! With a cart full of groceries and a happily kicking two-year-old, I couldn't resist this title, ONE-MINUTE PRAYERS FOR BUSY MOMS.<br /><br />Is it possible to pray in one minute? If you're a mom, that may be all the time you have. Yet, the Apostle Paul tells us to \\"Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances\\" (1 Thes. 5:16). So doesn't this mean we're to keep our heart focused on God throughout our busy days?<br /><br />When we're overwhelmed with our to-do list, we can let God handle the details. When we're bursting to tell someone how happy or sad or excited or lonely we are...then we can lift our thoughts heavenward at any moment. We're not alone.<br /><br />Hope Lyda has written a beautiful book that allows us to peek into her personal relationship with Christ. She covers a variety of topics that moms face every day: how to have a moment of quiet, things we worry about, disciplining our children, finding purpose, and asking why.<br /><br />Each short meditation opens with a scripture from the New International Version of the Bible. Then we read a prayer from the author that we may also pray. For example, the topic, \\"It's About Respect\\" offers this opener, \\"Lord, mold me into a mother worthy of honor. I cannot force my children to respect me, but I can live a life that is fruitful, deeply rooted in Your truth, and overflowing with Your love. I vow to bring my childen up in a godly way.\\"<br /><br />Fresh hope is waiting for readers of this book. I know lots of mothers who could enjoy this as a gift. It would fit wonderfully in a pretty basket along with some other pampering favorites: chocolate, coffee or tea, scented lotions, etc.<br /><br />Moms give so much to others that it's nice when a book comes along that helps us feed our own souls first.

A bright yellow row of jonquils blooms against a beautiful sage background. The name of the book, GUTSY LITTLE FLOWERS, is based on Cathy's admiration of these hardy plants, which burst into color even while the season of winter remains.<br /><br />Cathy writes, \\"Beneath the frozen ground the sleeping bulb stirs, bursts open, and a tiny green shoot fights its way toward the surface of the cold earth...This brave little flower stands as a precious reminder of spring amid a world weary of the gloom of winter.\\"<br /><br />The book is composed of over two dozen stories that delight the soul. Cathy's gift of writing shows in her knack for discovering deep, spiritual truths in seemingly ordinary events. You'll laugh out loud reading \\"Attack of the Killer Flypaper\\" and \\"One Hairy Dog and Two Crispy Biscuits.\\" And if you or anyone you know has been through a harrowing mammogram experience, you won't want to miss the author's descriptive account.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book as a wonderful gift to anyone on your list who loves good storytelling. I must add that Cathy Lee Phillips is also a warm and inspiring speaker. She spoke at our church, as well as my sister's, and gave completely different talks that had everybody laughing. She's so funny! Yet, she knows how to share truth that cuts right to the heart.<br /><br />You'll want to add her first book, SILVER IN THE SLOP, to your reading list as well.

God doesn't expect mothers to have all the answers, but He does expect us to go to Him...He not only has the answers, He IS the answer!\\"<br /><br />After reading this book for a few weeks, you'll feel a spirit of refreshment in your life, and your positive attitude will overflow joy in the lives of those around you.

And not a single one is starving.<br /><br />BACK FOR SECONDS is truly interactive. You can (and should) read the classic works, like Strunk and White's THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE, Zinsser's ON WRITING WELL, and Lamott's BIRD BY BIRD, but this book is a springboard for pursuing writing as a career.<br /><br />If you're a highly creative person, Bowerman's work will help you channel your creativity toward financially viable pursuits. Closet poets, for example, might be excellent at creating ad slogans, headlines, and web copy, while continuing to feed their souls through penning poetry.<br /><br />I've read his book through twice and now keep it next to my computer alongside my other reference books. At the end of chapter 3, Peter writes, \\"I asked commercial writers across the world to share their Web sites for inclusion in the book...You'll see a wide array of creative visions -- things you like and things you won't. It's all about getting ideas.\\"<br /><br />This list is invaluable for researching what others are doing in the field. I've enjoyed signing up for several newsletters, particularly the one published by Lisa Sparks of Integrity Writing, as well as Marcia Yudkin's Marketing Minute. Of course, you have to sign up for the author's delightful e-pub delivered monthly to your in-box!<br /><br />I think this book would make a worthwhile addition to university literature and writing programs.

In the same way Charlie and his little sister Lola endeared themselves to fans of I WILL NEVER NOT EVER EAT A TOMATO, parents and kids alike will delight in this comical plot.<br /><br />Drama arises when Lola is not convinced she needs to go to school. \\"I probably do not have time to go to school,\\" she says. \\"I am too extremely busy doing important things at home.\\" Instead of ridiculing her, big brother Charlie takes the time to tackle her fanciful excuses with his own inventive scenarios.<br /><br />When Lola says she doesn't care to learn to count above ten, Charlie replies, \\"What if eleven eager elephants all wanted a treat. How would you count up how many treats that would be?\\" Lola's still not quite sure.<br /><br />She doesn't need to learn to read, she says, because \\"I've got all my books in my head.\\" Again, Charlie counters with the possibility that she may HAVE to read a bedtime story sometime to an ever-so-angry ogre who won't go away unless she does.<br /><br />Page after page, the textured illustrations and vibrant narrative technique are pure delight. I imagine teachers, parents, and librarians breathe a sigh of relief when Lauren Child's books are chosen for storytime. Each phrase reads like a poem, not a word out of place.<br /><br />Unlike many works where brothers and sisters don't get along, the relationship between Charlie and Lola is precious. I'd recommend this book to anyone needing to help a child overcome apprehension of visiting someplace new: the dentist, church, relative's house, etc. Having a little friend like Soren Lorenson to tag along is a gentle way to dissuade those imaginary fears of childhood.	2005-06-07

Since Darrow is raising Aidan in his own Tambluff palace, he's watched the thick-as-kin friendship develop between blood-prince Steren and our hero -- whose destiny is foretold in the ancient legends.<br /><br />Scene after scene, the novel reads like watching a fast-paced action film. Aidan's deepest desire is to please his majesty, yet Darrow's jealousy turns to rage when Aidan captures a wild boar and impresses the court with his hunting skills. The king schemes to send the brave teen hero on an impossible quest, one that will lead him to the heart of the Feechiefen Swamp. Ah...he thinks. Aidan will never survive.<br /><br />Keep turning the pages. Away from the civilized world, Aidan returns to the swampy environment readers loved in book one, THE BARK OF THE BOG OWL. The plot spirals around a mind-boggling mystery. Why have the swamps become so dangerous? A new band of unfriendly feechies terrorizes the landscape. Where did they get their cold-shiny weapons of steel?<br /><br />The peril of Aidan's quest increases. Rattlesnakes! Man-eating `gators! And kidnappers haunt the swamps. Will Aidan discover the source of the new evil and return alive from his journey?<br /><br />One of the most delightful aspects of the book is the laugh-out-loud hilarity of the feechie dialogue and backwater culture. Kids will love the ick factor of feechie hospitality - (Ever been offered a bowl of wiggling grubs?) Parents will love the strong character that drives Aidan to go beyond his own strength...in a book that reveals the hidden source of our hero's devotion to uncovering truth.

As Chrysanthemum grows older, we can sense how good she feels about herself: her accomplishments of learning to crawl, walk, slide, ride a tricycle, read, and sing are recorded like snapshots on a single page. We imagine her parents behind a camera encouraging their little girl at every milestone.<br /><br />Then she starts kindergarten, and her sense of self is shattered, which Henkes cleverly describes as her feeling \\"wilted.\\" She's made fun of at school because her name is different; it's too long (\\"exactly half as many letters as there are in the entire alphabet!\\" shares Victoria). The taunts and jeers worsen, despite her parents' reassurance that she's still absolutely perfect in their eyes.<br /><br />The outcome of Chrysanthemum's struggles lies in the hands of a caring teacher, who takes the time to notice this tiny drama in her classroom.

Well, if you were Aidan Errolson, you would pass the hours writing letters on palmetto paper to your king. \\"I specialize in dragon-slaying,\\" Aidan writes, \\"but would be happy to fight pirates or invading barbarians if circumstances require.\\"<br /><br />So begins THE BARK OF THE BOG OWL, book 1 in the Wilderking fantasy adventure trilogy. The backdrop is the island kingdom of Corenwald, which fuses the enchanting elements of Narnia with the author's memories of growing up in south Georgia. The result: action-packed fun in the swamps and a castle surrounded by a moat full of mean ol' alligators.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful family read-aloud, enjoyable to all ages. It's noisy and exciting, and the feechiefolk dialect is often hilarious. These half-civilizers, also known as lizard men or tree alligators, become allies with the civilizer, Aidan. A deep friendship develops between Pantherbane (as Aidan becomes known to the feechies) and Dobro Turtlebane, striking a familiar chord with fans of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.<br /><br />From the first moment Aidan hears the distinctive bark of the bog owl, his thirst for adventure can't be quenched. Where will his calling lead him? Who is this mysterious Bayard the Truthspeaker, and why does he think Aidan might be the Wilderking, Corenwald's future deliverer?<br /><br />This book is only the beginning of the great story that lies ahead in the life of Aidan and the kingdom of Corenwald. It's a must-read to add to your collection of classic books that teach strong character and inspire a powerful faith in the unseen.	2005-05-26

It happens every spring when you need to pack away the winter clothes, and again after Christmas when you're trying to decide where to put your new array of gifts. You ask yourself, \\"Will I ever wear this again? Will I need this in the future? I wonder where I should put these.\\" If you're like most people, you avoid making these decisions and instead go off to Stuff-Mart and buy (yet more!) storage boxes.<br /><br />Year after year, many of us keep packing and sorting things we don't like, don't need, and have no space for. That's where Don Aslett's CLUTTER'S LAST STAND can bring a permanent change of attitude and relief! I admit that I have to read Aslett's book every time I'm faced with the daunting task of cleaning out a major area of our home.<br /><br />I have to thank Uncle Don because yesterday I finally got rid of all my turtlenecks. I hate turtlenecks! I live in the South, and our short, mild winters give me little need to dress in heavy layers. Yet, I can tell you a story about every garment in my closet: who gave it to me and when, where I wore it, and the places and people it reminds me of. Do you find yourself in this predicament? Emotional attachment to our belongings is what prevents us from decluttering our lives.<br /><br />There are plenty of books on organizing your stuff. In fact, several well-known magazines are devoted to helping the collector collect more beautifully. Aslett's book knows what readers need most is not six quick tips on organizing 95 pairs of old shoes: we need to know how to pare down our belongings so we can have more time and energy for the things that really matter.<br /><br />It's especially hard for parents -- your kids may whine and plead, \\"Please! I think it still fits!\\" or \\"I really do still play with it, just when you're not watching!\\" Even worse, \\"That came from so-and-so at my birthday party.\\"<br /><br />Read CLUTTER'S LAST STAND and learn to be ruthless. Save your money on buying more storage boxes (Aslett calls them \\"junk bunkers\\") and give away your extra to charity. While you're at it, Alsett will shock you with the other kinds of junk you have in your life: besides the warped Tupperware lids that you got for a wedding shower gift, what about your schedule? Can you pare down junk there? Are there certain people you need to let go of? Are your attitudes weighing you down? How about your eating habits -- excess weight is another type of clutter that you have to lug around everywhere you go!<br /><br />I find Aslett's book a staple of home organizing, though his philosophy is complemented by other books written by women. It's definitely not a good idea to get rid of everything that is sentimental to you and your children -- and there are other books that go into more detail about ways to save and preserve memories.<br /><br />Aslett says it best in the last chapter of the book: \\"Life doesn't begin at forty, sixty-five, twenty, thirty, when you get married, when you get promoted, or when you have grandkids -- life truly begins when you discover how flexible and free you are without clutter.\\"<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester) and give away your extra to charity.

While so many authors give parents specific how-to tips and make us feel like failures if we don't follow their advice exactly, Yates shows us it's a tough but often hilarious calling to raise young children.<br /><br />Because her book was first published in 1988, readers today can be assured Yates knows what she's talking about. Her five children are now grown, married, and raising their own families. Since her husband and children have also written books, the Yates' successful parenting experience is documented in the various stages of their journey.<br /><br />From this authority, Yates offers expert survival tips for mothers still in the trenches raising young children. Her book opens with the sinking feeling that her house is too quiet. Where are the twins? She discovers little black footprints trailing from the fireplace, across the brand new carpet, to the utility room freezer. \\"Peering inside, I found two little girls black with soot joyfully looking at books!\\" By seeing her in this situation, we understand she's been there, done that, and she knows what moms of young kids go through every day.<br /><br />The book is divided into ten sections: the first chapter offers a general overview of the challenges that face mothers, then the next eight sections look at each challenge specifically and offer tips for overcoming them. Examples include maintaining a positive image, establishing priorities that work, becoming a best friend in marriage despite the heavy demands of child-rearing, disciplining children, and shaping a Christian home. She ends the book with ideas for parents heading into the teen years, which is  another age she writes about in AND THEN I HAD TEENAGERS.<br /><br />If you enjoy this book, you'll also like Yates' essays, which are archived on the site for Today's Christian Woman magazine. Parents of college students will be blessed by another book written by the Yates' sons, THE INCREDIBLE FOUR-YEAR ADVENTURE: FINDING REAL FAITH, FUN, AND FRIENDSHIP AT COLLEGE.<br /><br />I highly recommend Yates' book for young moms, even going so far as to say it's my \\"Bible of parenting.\\" I've given away so many copies of this book to women in need of encouragement, and I've read and reread it dozens of times myself. Although many more recent books have been written on this topic, this is one of the absolute best.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn IvesterEAR ADVENTURE: FINDING REAL FAITH, FUN, AND FRIENDSHIP AT COLLEGE.

She's written one of my most treasured devotional books, and I keep it nearby whenever I'm starting to take life too seriously. Her personality absolutely sparkles through the pages of her book, drawing readers into a more intimate walk with God.<br /><br />Sue came and spoke to our women's group at church, and within minutes, she had a whole room full of ladies howling in laughter. She proudly displayed her rhinestone-covered Bible and admitted that she was \\"deep for a shallow person.\\"<br /><br />But Sue's faith is grounded in an intimate understanding of the God who heals. A breast cancer survivor, Sue is no stranger to the agony of a doctor's grim prognosis, or the loss of identity a woman feels when she suffers through surgery and chemotheraphy. Sue has a deep empathy for all women undergoing cancer treatment.<br /><br />And since a cheerful heart is the best medicine, Sue wants you to laugh with her through such chapters as, \\"You'll Find the Fruit of the Spirit in Plastic Bags Hanging from the Luggage Cart,\\" You Can't Put M&Ms in Alphabetical Order, Can You?\\" and \\"I Could Lose Myself in Thought, but Then Again, It's Such Unfamiliar Territory.\\"<br /><br />Sue's essays appear in other compilations, and she's a well-loved speaker and retreat leader. Her book makes a great gift for anyone who needs a pat on the back from a friend. It would also be perfect to keep on a night table in a guest room or at a retreat center (along with a cup of tea and some chocolate!)	2005-05-22

My uncle gave me this book in hardback when it first came out in 1991 because Feiler is from his hometown of Savannah, Georgia. I'm glad to see it's still in print in paperback because it's a classic that anyone interested in Japanese culture should read.<br /><br />Feiler begins his book by bravely stating, \\"I dropped my pants and felt a rush of cool wind against my legs.\\" He's standing on a stone path in the cool of evening his first night out of Tokyo. Twelve sets of eyes peer curiously at him, whom we learn are his new co-workers in the school where he's teaching. Yes, this is quite a bit of culture shock. Whereas in the states, a new teacher might be taken to a luncheon, Feiler says, \\"As a newcomer in Japan, I would be welcomed into my office as I was welcomed into the world: with a bare body and a fresh bath.\\"<br /><br />The author's sense of humor is evident throughout the book, and he spices up a tremendous volume of research with his engaging narrative. Since he's encountering everything for the first time, he describes his reactions in a way that helps initiate readers into Japan's fascinating and unique culture.<br /><br />I found it amazing that Feiler could experience so much in one year. For example, he breaks his ankle and must visit a hospital, which makes one understand why studying the Japanese language before embarking can come in handy. (Feiler appears to be fluent; did he learn that at Yale?) He attends sports day, field trips, city and small-town events, a wedding, and of course, the climactic journey up Mt. Fuji.<br /><br />Feiler's trip up Mt. Fuji was my favorite part of the book, and something I longed to do when I visited the Tokyo area -- yet I traveled mid-peak by car instead of on foot. When the author finally makes it to the top, he describes his view for us armchair travelers: \\"Standing on an isolated spot atop this ancient volcano, far removed from the crowds of Tokyo...we popped open our bottle of imported champagne and beheld the sight that has inspired a nation since the gods of heaven first descended the bridge to the Land of the Central Plain: the caress of the Rising Sun.\\" (This ancient myth is explained in detail in the book.)<br /><br />If you're planning on going to teach or travel in Japan, Feiler's work is a must-read; for no other reason, it will whet your appetite for writing down your own experiences (yes, he must have carried a notebook everywhere he went!). But you definitely should read more recent literature written by other travelers, as well as by native Japanese. I also recommend a good basic Nihongo course, so you'll be able to navigate the train systems in case you journey outside of the major cities. Or if by chance you end up in the hospital with a broken something or other.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivesterthis ancient volcano, far removed from the crowds of Tokyo...we popped open our bottle of imported champagne and beheld the sight that has inspired a nation since the gods of heaven first descended the bridge to the Land of the Central Plain: the caress of the Rising Sun.\\" (This ancient myth is explained in detail in the book.)

Mr. Say's book won the 1994 Caldecott Medal, the same year Lois Lowry received the Newbery for her book, THE GIVER.<br /><br />It's an understatement to say this is one of the most beautiful children's books ever written. Mr. Say gently describes his grandfather's youthful journey from Japan to America. On his three-week steamship voyage, he is astonished by the vastness of the Pacific Ocean. After embarking, he explores by train the  western landscapes of enormous rock formations and endless farm fields.<br /><br />During his travels, he meets people of different color, certainly a new sight for him. Say writes, \\"The more he traveled, the more he longed to see new places...\\" Eventually, his grandfather settles along the coast of California after briefly returning to Japan to marry his childhood sweetheart.<br /><br />The couple have a daughter, whom we later learn is Say's mother, the subject of another stunning picture book, TEA WITH MILK. In time, the grandfather begins to miss Japan, and he decides to return to his homeland, along with his wife and grown daughter.<br /><br />Say's watercolor artistry is fantastic, as his skilled brush gracefully ages each character in the book. As a parent, I imagined my own children growing up, and realized how brief is the time we call childhood. The story continues, with the grandfather's heart truly in two places, America and Japan.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever traveled abroad can relate to this experience. As I read his book, I wept, because I too have lived in Japan, and part of my heart will always remain overseas. Since this initial reading, I've bought several of Say's picture books, and they have become family favorites.<br /><br />The greatest literature reaches beyond its pages and connects to the hearts of its readers. Through his timeless words and portraits, Allen Say has clearly accomplished this task.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivesterthis task.    --Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester	2005-05-21

I certainly would never have picked up a book with a title like this, but I bought it because I've learned to trust Masterson's judgment. Day after day, his words make sense and move readers to action.<br /><br />His book is extremely helpful for women, especially mothers who step out of the work force to focus on raising their families a few years. Masterson believes it's not years and years of so-so experience that make a person successful; it's acquiring a needed set of skills, learning to excel in those skills, and having integrity.<br /><br />This is a book you can carry around and read anytime you have a minute. It's filled with powerful stories that energize you and show you that success comes to those who don't give up. Masterson's not afraid to share his failures and what he learned from them, and we can all glean from his \\"Ready, Fire, Aim\\" experiences.<br /><br />Here's a list of THE TOP TEN THINGS YOU WON'T HEAR MICHAEL MASTERSON SAY:<br /><br />1. The main characteristic of successful people is that they enjoy sleeping in late.<br />2. Watching a few hours of TV every night is a great way to spend your time (year after year after year...).<br />3. If you don't like your present job or income, stick it out and  spend the rest of your time entertaining yourself.<br />4. Complaining is the best way to get what you want.<br />5. The quickest way to become successful is to close yourself off from the world and work alone.<br />6. It's best to surround yourself with people who are pessimists.<br />7. If you're not financially independent by the time you're 40, it's too late. You'll never make it.<br />8. Don't bother saying thank you to people who help you. They're too busy to notice anyway.<br />9. When you make new friends, it's okay to let go of your old ones.<br />10. Busy, successful people don't have time to read fiction or exercise.<br /><br />All this to say, thanks for taking the time to write this book, Mr. Masterson. The wisest man who ever lived had this to say, \\"Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper\\" (Proverbs 13:4 NLT).write this book, Mr. Masterson.
