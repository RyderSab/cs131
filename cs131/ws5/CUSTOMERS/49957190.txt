The book's greatest strength is the way it connects the events in the three kingdoms -- England, Ireland, and Scotland --which is essential to see the overall picture in a confusing time. This Royle does well. I would have liked more discussion of the religious issues and a bit less on the battle details, but otherwise a fine history.	2005-08-16

But there are some problems with accuracy<br />On Cathar doctrines and practices he makes a few small errors, for example what a consolamentum was. He glosses over Cathar attitudes to women, with the intent one assumes of a whitewash. He gets at least one date wrong -- quite a spectacular one, the 'global arrest' of Montaillou in 1308 he places in 1309. These are just the errors I recall; there may be more.<br />The last chapter, on the mythologization of the Cathers, is a treat.	2004-02-11

Where this person was, when; who slept with whom, what they ate in this town and that. He gives a good account of the basisc beliefs of the Cathars. What is missing though is as much about what they thought or felt. And some of that is available, from the same copious records Weis uses. Ladurie's book Montaillou for instance includes snippets of conversation, where one of these characters sarcastically rebukes another. That sort of insight is mostly missing here.<br />I think Weis got lost in the detail, or the main thread did anyway.<br />An honorable, good book, but not an exciting one.	2004-02-10

The translators goal was to have lively and performable versions, and they do, so this may not bother everyone.<br />Each play has a simple stage diagram, and some notes on what the stage should be like (eg, the first house should be grand and imposing, but the neighboring house is small and unimpressive).

The Teach Yourself Beginner's French Grammar is much better, and no less advanced.<br />This is very poorly organized as a reference. Even the index is skimpy. It mostly follows the organization of a &quot;topics&quot; test -- which is not how I want a grammar book organized. That said it does a decent enough job of running over basic French grammar. But there are a lot of books in this area and this is one of the weaker.	2002-02-13

Yulin doesn't merely read, he performs, and his voice matches the role. The other parts are nearly all well played, and the music never intrudes. Atmospheric and involving for 9 hours!<br />The book is one of MacDonald's last, and it has some of the overwrought quality that mar his later books, but this is only occasionally a distraction. <br />For those looking for other MacDonalds, the best are The Chill, Far Side of the Dollar, the Zebra-Striped Hearse, The Galton Case (all from 1959-65).	2002-02-12

Bronstein uses the games of the tournament as a basis for a textbook on the middlegame. Some games get extensive notes, some light. It just depends on what ideas he finds in the game that are worth expounding! The annotations are always heavy on the idea and goals of the moves. Plus there are a lot of interesting games, with all the top players of the 50s (except Botvinnik): Smyslov (overpowereing here), Keres, Geller, Petrosian, Ktovo, Bronstein, Reshevsky.<br />Cheap too!	2002-01-17

The stories are vividly told, and always interesting, and she has a nice ey for detail. Refreshingly, the author is unwilling to let the abuses slide with a some platitude about multi-culturalism.<br />There are some annoyances. She tries too hard at times to argue that &quot;real&quot; Islam would not be like this, and her discussions of Islamic history are unskeptical. She takes a couple cheap shots at some westernm politicians she doesn't like.

Pipes explains that while in English &quot;the Satanic verses&quot; is a plain ordinary phrase that refers to an embaraasing event in Islamic history, this phrase is not used in Arabic. Most Muslims won't recognize the event by that designation; Muslims call it something quite different. But when &quot;verses&quot; is translated into Arabic the word used refers specifically to Quranic verses. So the title is translated roughly as &quot;The Satanic Verses of the Quran&quot; or &quot;The Satanic Quran&quot;. <br />Don't assume from this that Pipes if profferring an apologetic. He is not; this book is critical of &quot;fundamentalist Islam&quot;. But Pipes is careful to explain how such Muslims think and react.	2001-11-14

(Indeed it is harsh on monotheism in general.) Occasionally long winded or repetitive it none the less presents an organized forceful critique that cannot be ignored. And that took a lot of courage.<br />He discusses historical issues (the traditional Muslim history is a fable, quite untrue), the Quran (full of contradictions and absurdities as well as bile), the plight of women, and especially he argues that Islam is inimical to intellectual and human freedom.

This includes prioving many ruler&amp;compass constructions in geometry are impossible.<br />That sounds heavy but the remarkable thing is anyone who has taken grade 12 math should be able to follow it (with a bit of work) and anyone who has done first year algebra or calculus should be able to follow it all. <br />Very discursive, with a lot of sentences not just symbols to explain the ideas, and a lot of examples. Nice physical layout too.<br />A hard core math text written for non-mathematicians, and it succeeds. I also highly recommend it to anyone encountering groups or Galois theory for the first time.	2001-05-31

But Rhodes often branches out to wider bits of history, and often gets those wrong. For instance his entire discussion of MacArthur's dismissal is innacurate; he claims the joint chiefs wanted to keep him and only agreed to let Truman's firing him if they could deploay bombs to the pacific. This is wrong. See for instance Weintraub's recent &quot;MacArthur's War&quot; for a detailed account.<br /> Some of Rhodes's other arguments in places are contradictory.<br />Lots of interesting stuff though.	2001-05-02

He relies too heavily on Soviet sources, which he quotes at length. I think he can be called an apologist for Stalin in a few places. The maps are not very detailed and there are no photos. <br />But the book has some real strengths too. The overall campaign comes through clearly, the sense of the scope and harshness of the war is well drawn, and there are a lots of revealing anecdotes.<br />I would describe this as a journalistic account not a full scale history.

L C Epstein is better, as is French, or the old old Taylor book. Electrodynamics? Lots of good books in Dover.

The equations are messy, and the properties are so abstract. Van Ness deals directly and only with the second problem.  His discussion of energy functions and energy transformations just as rules between observables is very helpful. Using that notion to get at what he means by a property and then making entropy understandable as a PROPERTY of a system is the core of much of the book.
