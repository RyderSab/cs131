The situational humor would be far, far over  their 4-year-old heads.  Too many inside jokes, characterizations targeted  at adults, and illustrations that are too blah to really be engaging.  Not  a keeper.	1999-02-10
US	52842754	R2HDJKR19XR6KV	0553275283	509203925	Love Story	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A typical love story modernized for all to relate with.	Erich Segal takes in a ordinary love story and adds spice to liven it up.  Two characters with opposite personalities but the same love for one another plays off the plot well.  I can get a feel for their strong  attractions and even deep sacrifices for one another.  I found the constant  sarcasm between the two characters quite entertaining.  This book is very  much so modernized, with the two married and trying to get through college  without any help from their parents.  Like all love stories, this book ends  with something that conclusively impacts any  reader.  Segal is also  typical in his &quot;love story&quot; to end with a tragic ending.  From  the last three chapters, I got my own personal treat from this book.  It  gave me the opportunity to relate and somehow be a part of this love story  also.  Of course I won't tell you all the ending, but I can honestly say I  really enjoyed this book.  I would definitely recommend it to all readers  who wants to find their own relation with the book.  The life lesson it  taught me was to appreciate those that I love and mostly those that are  still existing before me (*hint, hint).	1998-12-18

The book Hit The Nerve was a bunch of new plays.  I didn't really enjoy it because I'm not to interested in dramatic stories to read, I think that it would be more for a drama student than just to read for fun.  It did have  quite a bit of descriptive scenes but other than that I wouldn't waste my  time.	1998-12-08

Help Wanted is a boring book of short stories, all dealing with young people and working.  It told about different jobs and what the daily routine and obstacles that young people had to go through with them.  I  found that the short stories seemed very long and dragged on and on.  It  was very hard to pay attention to and was not fun to read.I would only  recommend it to someone if they like reading things that contain nothing  interesting in them.	1998-12-08

Everytime I saw it I dreaded picking it up.  This book does not only talk about sacagawea, but it talks  about the journey westward with the explorers Lewis and Clark.  Unless you  are very interested in this native or you have to do a report on it in  school, I do not reccommend this book.	1998-12-08

When she was 17 her brother had a snowmobile accident, but Arden believes that he staged it.  It basically tells how Arden searches to  find her brother and how she realizes how important the little things in  life are.I really enjoyed reading this book, it taught me a lot about life,  love, and families.  I learned how important family can be and how you  should never take the things that you have for granted because they wil not  always be there.  I think that everyone should read the book Thin Ice.  It  had a very realistic plot and a basic story line that is easy to learn a  lesson from.	1998-12-08

Some of the stories are interesting. One is about a girl who was sent to Puerto Rico to live with her grandparents for the  summer. Her experiences give insight to the Puerto Rican culture. An  example is how her father drove spirits out of people. With an exception of  one or two, the other short stories lack quality.	1998-12-08

I didn't think that any of the parts were to boring.  It was kind of scary to really think that something like that could really  happen.  It was about a boy who just got a gun for his birthday and went  out to shoot trees and shot a man.	1998-12-08

Lasting Echos is a book of true stories with many facts.  The way that the stories are formed is interesting but it drags on.  If you are someone that is interested in Native culture this could be the book for you.  The  discription of what happen in different situations is well written.  I  think younger people might like it because they can create images of the  stories.  Teenagers probally would not relate to it and not keep their  interest.	1998-12-07

Robert Cormier's novels always grab my attention right from the first page, this novel did not break the trend.  This book was very interesting if you enjoy trying to figure out what make psychotic criminals, and  troubled adolescents do what they do. A young woman is fixated on a  convicted child murder, who is longing for another vicitm. And with this  victim the ability to achieve another moment of tenderness.	1998-12-07

I just couldn't put it down. This book was so informative that I now feel I understand a little more the thoughts of a homosexual teenager. It's made me much more tolerant  to diversity. I see how hard it is for homosexuals to live in our society.  I feel everyone should read this book.	1998-12-07

I was interested pretty much throughout the book.  It really got into the minds of teenagers.  The minds of the characters are pretty much the minds of a real high school student.  When  someone new comes to the neighborhood everyone is interested in that  person.  There is always something mysterious about that person and T.J.  (The new kid) is very much so.  Everone wishes that the romance in their  relationship is as well as the one in the book.  This book gives the reader  some hope that some guys are romantic.  I would have to recommend this book  for girls mainly because I don't think guys would get emotional over the  ending of the book.	1998-12-07

It makes you want to read more so you find out what happens or what is going to happen.  What also makes it fun to read is that it is very up to date and the slang is excellent! This  play by Gary Soto tells you what a &quot;teenage date&quot; with a girl is  really all about.	1998-12-07

Austin's revised edition is full of beautiful photographs and glowing  decriptions of his English roses. In fact, some of his descriptions are a  little too glowing, since he fails to acknowledge some of the serious  shortcomings these plants can have.  In addition, the subtitle  &quot;glorious roses for American gardens&quot; is misleading:  nowhere  does Austin discuss the behavior of his plants in climates warmer than  England's.  Many, many of the beautiful photos are not labled, so it's  impossible to know what rose you're seeing in what picture, and at least  one rose in the field guide is paired with an incorrect photo.  Tho book is  very poorly edited, loaded with typos and missing words and sentences that  make little sense because they simply stop without completing thoughts, as  though someone forgot to type the rest of them.  That being said, it's  probably worth it to rose lovers on the basis of its pictures alone, since  it does include photos of the flowers with a substantial piece of the lower  foliage, and each rose description does come with a line drawing of its  growth habit, which can be useful in planning out garden locations.  If  only the text had been cleaned up a little more...if only Austin had  acknowledged the popularity of his roses overseas by presenting some data  about the effects of warmer climes...if only this book didn't cost so darn  much...	1998-08-25

Martin gives detailed information about the growth habits, disease resistances and bloom sizes of these plants that isn't to be found easily elsewhere.  He specifies the ultimate size of the bush as it relates to climate -- different heights/widths depending on warm/cool climates -- which is so important to gardeners trying to figure out where to put these shrubs.  He does include some pictures of varieties in the front section of the book (which deals with culture) which he then fails to include in the field guide, and his comments on cold hardiness are vague in many cases, but he has obviously been growing most of these roses himself and offers first-hand information.  It's like a chat with your local rosarian.	1998-07-30

Snoozers is short, real short, and as bright and cheery as a fistful of greeting cards.

I bought several design books at once, and this is the only one that appears to have been written by a real person, as opposed to some pretentious Stepford wife.

Sure, she's got the antique thing down, but her &quot;trademarks,&quot; like the all-white sofa, are impractical for anyone with kids -- heck, they're impractical for anyone with a husband who insists on eating dinner on the couch (Emmerling mentions her children in the book, even includes pictures of them when they were younger, but they are suspiciously perfect in appearance and I began to wonder if they were real).  Most of the tips in this book are over simplified, to the point of being flat-out silly.  &quot;How to Casually Throw a Blanket on a Chair&quot; (just toss it!) or &quot;How to Give Your Kitchen a Sense of Bounty&quot; (put out bowls of fruits and veggies -- whoopee) are akin to wondering &quot;If I'm serving Chicken Nuggets, What flowers should I put on the table?&quot; (try red and yellow daisies for that casual, McDonalds chic...)  If it's not insultingly simple, it's financially impossible:  like decorating a living room in a day....which you can do (according to Emmerling) with several expensive antiques (presupposing, of course, that you can even locate such pieces) wall sconces (doesn't anyone ever have to rewire but me?) and collections of American primitives, the ammassing of which represents several lifetimes worth of work.  I think she really believes anybody can do this stuff.  I say, anybody with a big fat wallet probably can.  For the rest of us?  Puh-leez, Mary Emmerling...get real.	1998-02-20

Mayes' voice pulls you into the landscape -- lets you feel the sun on your head, the cool stillness of the churches, helps you see the profusion of light and color.  I'll admit, there were things in the book that seemed left unfinished;  I, too, wanted to know more about Mayes' divorce and her relationship with Ed.  But it is, after all, a memoir, and our lives are rarely so open and orderly as we might like them to be.  I think the book's ultimate appeal is in the idea of going somewhere so far away that you are utterly removed from all the concerns and frustrations of life -- that somewhere there is a haven of rest.  Most of us will never get there because of finances, careers, families...but in this book, for a little while, we can visit.	1998-01-28

The pace at the beginning is very slow -- too slow for its target audience of 9-12 year olds.  Jip's revelation comes late in the book and seems too lightly dealt with to be realistic.

In case the Kirkus reviewer has forgotten, children do need to be taught values and DON'T always understand how their actions impact others.  Any parent can tell you that.

I can't for the life of me figure out why Kathy Lee Gifford was touting it so much a year or two ago.  I'll grant that the pictures are fine, if you like that comic-book distortion so common to Disney products.  The text is pallid at best, with no real style and certainly nothing to mark it as very original.  I found it impossible to believe that the boy, much less the donkey, would actually consider the butcher a viable alternative...is this supposed to show nobility of character?  Is it trying to make a point about sacrifice?  Could it be some kind of misguided, heavy-handed attempt to foreshadow the crucifixion?  Or is it just really bad writing?  I bought this for a nephew without reading it first, and I've definitely learned my lesson.  With so many really good books about Christmas and the nativity out there, don't waste your money on this one; it belongs in the dumpster.  Blech.	1998-01-14

Now both books have become a cherished part of my library.  There's something so warm and human about Margaret, and the way she radiates life and light -- it's no wonder the very ghosts want to be near her.  Grumpy Brother Gregory is equally endearing for the journey he makes from Margaret's skeptic to her paramour.  Riley does a good job of portraying someone who believes Margaret, but can't bring himself to admit it, even in the privacy of his own mind.  Every character in this book is so wonderfully crafted and believable, and the period so realistically evoked -- the whole 14th century just comes alive in these pages. What a great read.	1997-12-19
