For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!r.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!	2002-05-17

The technique of using letters and journals is interesting, and it helps us to see the situation from different points of view. The pace is nice and swift, and the book rarely drags. Some images are drawn well, and some characters are memorable. It must also be stated that this book provided the foundation for the several Dracula movies. (Notably the Lugosi and Langella version.) Unfortunately, the 1979 version of Dracula with Frank Langella as Dracula and Laurence Olivier as Abraham Van Helsing shows the flaws in the book. (1) It's hard to see the Dracula in this book as anything but a monster who gets what he deserves in the end. Frank Langella makes Dracula all the more frightening by making him human and fascinating. We may not feel sorry for him, but he is more fascinating than repulsive. (2) It takes little to know that in the book, Renfield is under Dracula's power. John Badham (the director of Frank Langella's &quot;Dracula&quot;) probably realized that it would be better to give Renfield the initial appearance with Dracula to introduce us to Dracula's evil. This allows for a less obtuse John Harker. (3) Delaying John Harker's meeting Dracula offers us more surprises, a greater unfolding of terror, and allows for a more intelligent John Harker who gradually realizes the danger of Dracula. (4) Laurence Olivier keeps the eccentricities of Abraham Van Helsing, but tones them down nicely. Also, Laurence Olivier (Abraham Van Helsing) is much more convincing here since he has an axe to grind. (Dealing with the death of his beloved daughter, seeing her turned into a vampire, having to run a stake through his own daughter's heart, and having to listen to her cry: 'papa' before she is destroyed.) (5) Making Lucy (Nelligan) an eventual willing victim of Dracula who attacks her father, her possibly to be husband, and father of her recently deceased best girl friend introduces new meaning to the word terror. For the record,this is much more captivating than Mina's sudden absurd pity for Dracula. I don't see how we can go along with any sympathy for Dracula in the book. Unlike Macbeth from &quot;Macbeth&quot; or Claudius from &quot;Hamlet&quot; we were never permitted to see him as human. (6) The book has Renfield's murder off stage. (We shouldn't really have trouble knowing Dracula did it at this point.) So much is lost here. In Langella's movie, much of Langella's crimes have been offstage. There is unspeakable terror in the fact that we finally  see a brutal murder on stage. Don't get me wrong. This is a good book that deserves a place in the museum of literature, and it did pave the way for Lugosi and Langella.But in all honesty, John Badham, Frank Langella, Laurence Olivier, Trevor Eve, Donald Pleasence, and Kate Nelligan outdid the book in evry sense of the word.	2001-10-03

One of the themes in Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet&quot; is the presence of good and evil in all of us. Just as Claudius (the villain) has some notable redeeming qualities, Hamlet (the hero) displays evil at times. Hamlet's (arranged murder) of Rosencratz and Guildenstern IS NOT to be admired. Claudius hired them to spy on Hamlet, but they had no knowledge of the fact that Claudius murdered his brother (Hamlet's father). Some critics feel that they got what they deserved for playing this game with Claudius, but are we missing a crucial point? Except for what Claudius did to get the crown, he is a likable and effective monarch. So why should Guildenstern and Rosencratz have hesitated to this? Rosencratz and Guildenstern honestly wanted to help Hamlet, and they had a right to get stern with Hamlet after the uncalled for death of Polonius. They had no knowledge that they were taking Hamlet to his death in England. (The reason they were given was that they were taking him there for sanctuary so Claudius could prevent the Danes from demanding Hamlet's death or execution for the murder of Polonius.) In this play Stoppard reduces the mentality of Guildenstern and Rosencratz to slapstick clowns. (In &quot;Hamlet&quot; they are ignorant of crucial facts, but they are not stupid.) Also, important scenes from &quot;Hamlet&quot; with Guildenstern and Rosencratz are missing. I was expecting a play that would sympathize with Guildenstern and Rosencratz, but instead I saw a play that reduced their mental capacity and nearly made their deaths a big joke. Perhaps this is an interesting study, but don't put it on your priority list.	2001-02-09
US	49979986	R21I2OB96ZMLV2	0140435123	16284361	Nicholas Nickleby (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Not Dickens' Best, But An Intriguing Study	This is not exactly &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; or &quot;David Copperfield.&quot; But remember, no matter how good any author is, not every single thing they write can be a masterpiece, and there are things that make this 3rd novel of Dickens an intriguing study. Strong drama and cynical humour is present. The villainous Squeers foreshadows fascinating villains like Carker and Murderstone. Ralph is a complex character. He is devious, but Dickens does not let us forget that he is human. Mrs Nickleby is overly emotional and naive, but she is heroic in her own way. Vincent Crummles and his group allow us to see Dickens' interest in theatre and performing (which he would eventually do some work in). Nicholas is a well drawn protagonist. He is steadfast and admirable, but at times we may feel his actions are severe and uncalled for. Kate is not Dickens' best character, but she certainly foreshadows later heroines like Florence Dombey, Louisa Gradgrind, and Lizzie Hexham. Noggs is fine as a good samaritan. Fanny and Matilda give us an interesting chapter of girly talk, and Fanny (Squeers' daughter) allows us to see the fury of a scorned woman. Even in this 3rd novel, Dickens shows his ability to create superb images, irony, and surprise events. The pace does get sluggish at times, but other than that, this creation gives little scope for complaint. So while &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; is not a masterpiece, it certainly helps us to see the greatness that was to come.	2001-02-07

If you only want to read Dickens' finest books that show his best talents, you may do better to stick with books like &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; or &quot;Our Mutual Friend.&quot; All of that aside, I can not understand why this never gained the same popularity as &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (which also shows a departure from Dickens' standard formula). The opening is quite captivating and the images are well painted. Right away Dickens grabs our attention with the mysterious 'dead man' (who will later prove to be a VERY significant live person). Like Dickens' other villains, Chester is very wicked, but he carries a charm that makes him more fascinating than repulsive. Geoffrey Haredale is a captivating figure who APPEARS cold, but he proves himself to be quite virtuous. Although we don't really get to know Emma and Dolly that well, they do grab our attention at times. Mary (Barnaby Rudge's mother) is memorable as a (widowed?) woman who does her best for her son and displays her fears dramatically. The 'dead man' reappears every now and then to keep us in suspense. The conversations between Ned and his father Chester are quite memorable. Varden is fine in his secondary but significant role. Barnaby is not exactly Dickens' most memorable protagonist, but he does portray someone caught in the middle fairly well. One thing Dickens does quite well is that he first draws personal disputes over religion, and then he draws civil riots over religious differences. Some memorable lines are also present: (&quot;I arrest you in the name of God who has delivered you into my hands,&quot; &quot;May he die a violent death as I do now and have the night wind as his only mourner.&quot;). The final fight between Chester and Haredale is a fitting conclusion for this excellent work. So we have a great combination of drama, suspense, horror, and even some comedy. My only complaints about this are that I feel some more time could have been spent on the 'dead man' in developing his character and explaining his actions, and I do miss the filial piety that is prevalent in other novels of Dickens. I do not feel that this represents Dickens' best efforts; but it is FAR from his worst creation. This is every bit as good as the popular &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot;	2001-01-16
US	49979986	R6GPK841LUILP	1853262447	596871917	Old Curiosity Shop (Wordsworth Classics) (Wordsworth Collection)	Books	3	6	8	N	N	A Notable Story,  But Not Dickens' Best Effort.	For those of you who follow my reviews, you know that I felt &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; was Dickens' worst book. &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; is better, but not by much. Now on one hand, the story has captivating elements. The relationship between Trent and Nell is well done, and their flight together offers generous amounts of suspense. Images are well drawn, tension is tightened and released at appropriate intervals, and it is unlikely that you will get bored. Swiveller and the abused servant girl provide an interesting subplot. (For any other author, this would have been excellent. But this does not represent Dickens' finer efforts.) Nell does not hit us the way characters like Lizzie Hexham (&quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;), Amy Dorrit (&quot;Little Dorrit&quot;), Louisa Gradgrind (&quot;Hard Times&quot;), Agnes (&quot;David Copperfield&quot;), or Florence Dombey (&quot;Dombey and Son&quot;) do. Kit is handled somewhat awkwardly. The end does not seem to fit. I understand that Dickens may have been trying to make the end ironic, but it just does not seem to fit well. Benevolent characters like Martin and Swiveller are handled fairly well, but we don't really get to know them the way we get to know benevolent characters like Sam Weller (&quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;) or Mr. Micawber (&quot;David Copperfield&quot;). In all honesty, Quilp seems to be the most fascinating character in this book. He displayed pure terror, but he was also funny, and even likable at times! While I was going through this book, I found myself waiting for Quilp to reenter! Gradually, I found myself leaning towards Quilp's side. I could not believe how awkwardly he died. Perhaps while Dickens was writing this, he was not sure of how to end it, and decided not to use too much effort on something that was not his best work. I guess my biggest complaint is that compared to Quilp, the benevolent characters seem dull and flat. (Don't get me wrong. I understand that Dickens loved to make his villains more fascinating than  repulsive.) But benevolent characters like Mr Pickwick, Sam Weller, (&quot;Pickwick Papers&quot;), Agnes, Mr. Micawber (&quot;David Copperfield&quot;), Captain Cuttle (&quot;Dombey and Son&quot;), Dr. Manette (&quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;), Jo (&quot;Great Expectations&quot;), and John Harmon (&quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;), have captivating qualities that match those of the villains. Once again, this IS a good book, but it does not (in my opinion) reflect Dickens' better efforts.	2001-01-07

This book told me that I was in for a REAL exciting journey towards my B.A. &quot;Beowulf&quot; is no less than an exquisite masterpiece. It is just the right length, the images are well drawn, the language is well used, and the plot is more complex than we may have thought. The setting prior to Beowulf's entrance is well constructed. Beowulf's character is well prepared upon his entrance. Unferth is well placed. He reveals to us that despite Beowulf's piety and courage, he is not a flawless hero. He suffers from excessive pride. Beowulf's fight with Grendel offers suspense and captivation, and we are even allowed a small amount of sympathy for Grendel when he escapes only to die later. We are then told the story of Siegmund, and his fall over excessive pride foreshadows Beowulf's fall. (History repeats itself.) Grendel's mother than comes to avenge her son. (This goes way beyond a simple chapter.) She is a threat that must be dealt with, but it is difficult not to feel sorry for her. (She is after all a mother in sorrow over her son's death.) Although Unferth rebuked Beowulf earlier, he joins with Beowulf for a common cause, and later, Beowulf ADMITS that the battle was very close. (He is not invincible.) King Hrothgar then warns Beowulf of excessive pride. Later the dragon attacks, and Beowulf displays excessive pride (the very thing King Hrothgar warned him against). In this battle Beowulf does fight with courage, and Wiglaf displays touching loyalty to Beowulf in this battle where Beowulf dies. Beowulf's funeral is a fitting end for this masterpiece. So we have a hero with strength, virtues, and flaws, suspense, well organization, well drawn supporting characters, complex villains, and even an element of mystery! Who was this author?	2000-10-29
US	49979986	RKDEFOFD9EIG5	1854593455	321463682	The White Devil (Drama Classics Series)	Books	4	4	9	N	N	Marlowe and Shakespeare's Protege (Corrected)	For those of you who read my reviews and use them to try to understand literature, I owe you an apology. I made a slight error in my review of this, and I will correct it now. For those of you who know me, I cherish the writings of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Milton, Hawthorne, and Dickens. I now have a 6th hero. The opening is quite captivating when through testimony we learn of Lodovico's evil. Webster also grabs our attention with the affair between Vittoria and Bracciano. Despite the questionable qualities of these 2 characters, they are easy to like. He also draws the division between the virtuous Francisco and the ambitious Bracciano well. Cornelia is memorable as the mother who despairs over the actions of her children Flamineo and Vittoria. Isabella is fine as a picture of innocence. The Cardinal is captivating as one of the most careful characters in the play,and we need not be surprised when he gets elected Pope. Bracciano's son Giovanni is drawn well. Through an early appearance, we get a look at his character. We then see him in mourning after he has lost both his parents. Finally, we see him restore order after the massacre has fully unleashed. Lodovico is fine as a picture of ambition. (The mistake I made was that I named Lodovico in the murder of Isabella. He was innocent of her murder. But it is possible to wonder if his affair with her 'Bracciano's wife' triggered Bracciano's affair with Vittoria. Ofcourse, the affair between Bracciano and Vittoria triggers the events of this play.) Webster also offers us horrifying and yet beautiful passages, chilling omens such as the ghosts of Isabella and Bracciano, and pure suspense. My only complaint about this is that Lodovico's delight in his massacre does not mix well with Giovanni's sudden rise to power and his restoration of order. In Marlowe's &quot;Edward II,&quot; the 17 year old Edward III fills his enemies with pure terror when he gains control of the situation. Once again, I apologize for my error, and Iwish to thank all of you who found my reviews helpful.	2000-10-25

Only Webster could combine this much violence and beauty so well! Webster starts the play well when Antonio and Delio make comments on  questionable characters. (Bosola and the Cardinal) Bosola is drawn well as the hired hand reluctant to join the demonic Ferdinand. 2.5 is captivating when Ferdinand explodes with fury upon discovering that the Duchess has married. The cardinal shows an interesting foil to Ferdinand when he tries to encourage caution. The fury exchanged between Ferdinand and the Duchess in 3.2 is memorable. Bosola offers a striking passage on politicians in 3.2. The tragic ceremony in 3.4 is sorrowful and yet  beautiful. The parting of Antonio and the Duchess in 3.5 is very lamentable. 4.1 allows us to see that Ferdinand is not only evil, but demented as well. This paves the way for his final insanity. Bosola's hesitation to carry out the murder is well constructed. Ferdinand's final torture of the Duchess reminds us that he is not simply cruel, but psychotic as well. The Duchess is memorable when she faces her death with dignity. Webster DOES NOT stop here! Ferdinand actually taunts the hired killer and this paves the way for the final act. 5.3 is a scene that not even Marlowe or Shakespeare ever used. Fragments of Antonio's own echo foreshadow his death. Bosola's accidental murder of Antonio and his remorse pave the way for the final massacre! Even here, Webster keeps his efforts up. The cardinal's passage on fear of damnation keeps us in chills. Bosola's death and passage of remorse is a fitting end for this excellent work. My only complaint about this play is that the Cardinal could have been more complex.	2000-10-25

Well, I now have a 6th favorite. Lodovico is frighteningly demonic. 1st he participates in the murder of Isabella, then he participates in the revenge of Isabella! Poor Isabella is memorable as a picture of innocence. Vittoria is an interesting woman. She is not exactly a picture of innocence, but she does carry herself well, and she faces her death with as much dignity as possible. Webster also draws the dissension between Francisco and Bracciano well. Bracciano is captivating with all of his ambition. Francisco is memorable as the good and decent man prompted to fury by the death of his innocent sister. The harsh tones between Cornelia and her son Flamineo are dramatic. Bracciano's son Giovanni is well drawn. First he is an innocent young man, but his lines reveal his good character. Then we see him after he has lost both his parents. Finally, he flips the tables on everyone and restores order. Cardinal Monticelso is also captivating. He is a very careful character who probes the situations without losing his sense of reason. And we need not be surprised when this careful character is promoted to Pope Paul IV. What's left? Only striking images, only well constructed passages, only pure terror side by side with beauty etc. My only complaint about this play is that Webster combines 2 wonderful final touches that would be wonderful by themselves, but do not combine well (in my opinion). Lodovico's delight in his massacre does not (in my opinion) mix well with Giovanni's sudden rise to power and his sudden crush of the situation. In my opinion what makes Edward III's restoration to order in Marlowe's &quot;Edward II&quot; so dramatic is the pure terror the 17 year old king instills in his enemies. At this point, I would like to thank all of you who found my reviews helpful.	2000-10-23

But I am sad to say this is (in my opinion) the worst book he wrote. But I think it only fair to say that even what I consider his worst book is good. Sadly, I feel that this book lacks either the hilarious tone of &quot;The Pickwick Papers,&quot; the cynical edges of &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; the images of &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; the superb orginization of &quot;Dombey and Son,&quot; the unforgettable characters of &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; the multiple dimensions of &quot;Bleak House,&quot; the swift pace of &quot;Hard Times,&quot; the psychological insights of &quot;Little Dorrit,&quot; the memorable moments of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities,&quot; the unity of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; the superb puzzle of &quot;Our Mutual Friend,&quot; or the chilling terror of &quot;Edwin Drood.&quot;  The only good things I can say about this book are that some images are well drawn, there are some comical moments such as when Martin discovers that Pecksniff stole his building design,  and there are some well done scenes such as the deaths of Anthony and Jonas. Pecksniff is somewhat interesting as the man who can not seem to give up his role as a father or a teacher. I will not say this book is a waste of time, but I strongly suggest that you make time for Dickens' other books first.	2000-10-15

In my opinion, it is a horrible mistake to ignore parts 2 and 3. The blind Oedipus is touchingly lead by his daughter. (I can not help but suspect  this inspired the relationship between Edgar and Gloucester in  Shakespeare's &quot;King Lear.&quot;) It is also in this play that we see  Creon is not exactly an outstanding citizen. He seemed nice enough in part  1, but once he has Oedipus' power, he is somewhat of a tyrant. It is also  in part 2 that we are able to get a closer look at Oedipus. (REMEMBER, HE  DID NOT KNOW HE HAD KILLED HIS FATHER, MARRIED HIS MOTHER, AND HAD CHILDREN  WITH HIS MOTHER.) It is in this play that we see the human side of Oedipus.  I can not overestimate the beauty of the scene where &quot;seemingly  sighted&quot; he enters the Greek Version of heaven. Again remember, the  story does not end here. You MUST read &quot;Antigone&quot; (Part 3).	2000-05-22

When I finished the 1st of the trilogy, I was so overcome with  horror that I had to smoke some cigarettes to calm down. But remember, the  play DOES NOT end here.

The death of Antigone and  Creon's son is a worthy followup to the horror of Oediuus blinding himself  and the beauty of Oedipus &quot;seemingly sighted&quot; entering the Greek  version of heaven. It is also interesting that when Creon beholds this  horror, he too becomes human again. It is interesting that Sophocles  creates both intense horror and beauty in each part of the trilogy.

When I was in school this book FLOORED me. Not a single page is wasted! The play is dramatic from one scene to the next! Clytemnestra is memorable as a pre  Goneril. (A lustful female villain  with no conscience.) Agamemnon is  memorable as her virtuous husband who is tricked into performing an act of  blasphemy. The death of the virtuous Agamemnon silenced me until I had the  strength to read part 2. What makes this (along with the next 2 parts) a  masterpiece beyond expectations, is that each third of the trilogy is a  captivating piece of work in itself.

AH, and if they are, this book is a CRUCIAL STUDY. As an English Major, I  encountered WAY TOO MANY critiques that are based on absurd marxist  theories. Remember, literature reflects a SPECIFIC TIME, PLACE, AND ERA! I  am a devout Anglican and I DO NOT shun Hawthorne's work because much of it  is Anti Anglican. I understand that Hawthorne was reflecting an Anti  Anglican Period in America. It is absurd to judge literature harshly  because it does not fall into contemporary political slots whatever they  may be at the moment. This book by Aristotle is a concise, focused, and  appropriate look at the concept of literature. He emphasizes the need of  close conflicts as opposed to hero versus enemy. He also makes it clear  that writing must have recognition and/or reversal at some point. Also, he  states the need for surprise events. Another thing he does is he helps us  see that some events may be important, but it is better to mention them  instead of displaying them. He also stresses the need for characters to  play on our fear or pity. While this is more of a reference book,  it  belongs in the library of any student of literature.	2000-05-21

In all honesty this is a phenomenal piece of literature. Wilde offers comedy of several sorts. The bickering between Jack and Algernon and the bickering between Gwendolen and  Cecily is well drawn. Lady Bracknell is a dominating figure in herself.  Miss Prism and the Priest are also memorable supporting characters. Wilde  also offers a funny repetition of events when first Jack tries to woo  Gwendolen under an alias identity and then Algernon tries to woo Cecily  under the same  alias identity. This makes the scene where they all meet  together hilarious! But Wilde DOES NOT stop here! After the 2 men and 2  women bickered with each other, Jack and Algernon team up to win the love  of their lives, and Gwendolen and Cecily team up to determine the integrity  of Jack and Algernon. The end of this defines dramatic irony! (I don't want  to spoil it.) Perhaps the greatest thing about this book is that Wilde  skillfully balances subtle humour and major dramatic irony. If you like  this book, you MUST see the Paramount Production. Most video stores should  have it.	2000-05-20

Nevertheless, this is an interesting piece of literature. H.G. Wells does a very good job of creating images. He also manages to offer us  suspense, comedy, drama, and  chills. One thing he does very well is that he grabs our attention in the  2nd half by revealing the identity of the invisible man along with his  background. Perhaps the worst I can say about this book is that I enjoyed  the movie with Claude Rains better.	2000-05-17

With his fine writing skills, Churchill teaches nearly 1,000 years of history in an educated, interesting, moving, suspenseful, and even entertaining manner. He also offers beautiful  photographs of certain historical figures. One thing he does very well is  that he gives a scholarly view of historical figures (like King Henry VIII)  who are subjected to harsh and inaccurate views. My only complaint about  this book is that he speeds over some things that should have been given  more attention. (Just make sure this is not your only book on the subject.)  If I was teaching history, I would most probably have my students buy this.  Letting this book go out of print  (in my opinion) was a MAJOR MISTAKE!	2000-05-12

Now to be sure, the book is good. It offers some interesting insight into human nature. The images are fine and it does have  some well placed comedy and tragedy. But in all honesty, the movie OUTDOES  the book. Mel Gibson makes the disfigured teacher all the more profound and  sympathetic. Also, Gibson deepens the story by emphasizing the tragic past  of Justin along with his isolation. The book focuses more on Justin's  ruined face. Gibson takes it a BIG step further and combines the  biological, historical, and social scars. Don't get me wrong. It's a good  book, but if you have already seen the movie,chances are you will be  disappointed just as my mother was.	2000-05-12

On one hand this book is a valuable tool. It offers summaries of the plays, historical production dates, close looks at different characters, and interesting comments. On the other hand, it is too modern. Too many of  the Boyce's opinions judge Shakespeare's writing by modern standards. Many  English Majors (myself included), abhor Marxist beliefs. The reason is that  literature reflects a SPECIFIC TIME, PLACE, AND ERA. It is NOT RIGHT to  condemn an author because his work does not fall into the contemporary  political slots (whatever they might be at the moment). I suggest this book  for the plot synopsis sections. (They are very helpful.) But I would not  judge the plays by the Marxist theories presented.	2000-05-11

My only complaint about this book is that Asimov gets too strong in some of his personal opinions. (Harsh opinions of Banquo, Brutus, Richard II etc.) But aside from that I value this book highly. He helps us to see some  things Shakespeare's original audience would be able to pick up on WITHOUT  being told. This helps one to understand Shakespeare's plays more. Also for  the most part he DOES avoid the absurd marxist views that tend to over  simplify the anaylisis. He is especially helpful in the history plays.  Understanding Shakespeare's historical plays depends to a large extent on  knowing the facts that Shakespeare does not mention (but that the original  audience would have known). He also offers educated speculation that offers  deep insights. While I do not agree with him on EVERYTHING, his views are  interesting.	2000-05-11

My father always leaned towards the King  James version or the Revised Standard. (My church for the most part uses  the Revised Standard.) In my opinion this multi version helps you to  perform a better study of the Scriptures. My reason is quite simple.  Different parts of the Scriptures come off better in different  translations. (Luke wrote with the purpose of creating beautiful images.  This comes off best in the &quot;King James&quot; version. John wrote with  a hostile tone to help the followers of Christ break their ties with the  Jewish Authorities. This comes off best in the &quot;Living&quot; version.  Certain complicated texts are best understood in the &quot;Revised&quot;  version.)

The English were screaming  for Richard to release them, and he maintained a deep silence on the  matter. By January 1484, the French Government was broadcasting  accusations. She helps even the most obtuse person see that Henry VII COULD  NOT have been the killer. With all of Richard's people growing disloyal, it  is beyond question he would have produced the princes if they had been  alive. If they died under the orders of someone else, Richard would have  had the sense to proclaim what really happened. I feel this book is the  perfect cure for stupidity over the matter!	2000-05-07

My only complaint about this book is that it tells a complete falsehood of the blessed Anglican Martyr Charles Stuart. To put this in a nutshell, Queen Victoria had a grudge against several of her predecessors (including  Charles the martyr.) During her reign she fabricated the tale that Charles  was a self server. On the other hand she tried to make the monstrously evil  Cromwell into a champion of constitution and democracy. (Don't take my word  for it. Read Winston Churchill's &quot;History of the English Speaking  People&quot; 1955). Otherwise, this book is EXCELLENT. It offers a brief  listing of the different houses. It also offers a beautiful photograph of  each monarch. For the most part, it offers a brief but accurate  passage on  each of the monarchs. One thing Best does very well is that he goes beyond  common and inaccurate opinions of some famous monarchs (including Henry  VIII) and gives a scholarly opinion of their contributions to England.	2000-05-07

First  he offers us a very deep (and quite probable) speculation of what was going  on between the crucifixion and resurrection. He also goes beyond the  Scriptures and speculates on what may have been going through the Apostles'  minds when all this happened. But the greatest thing Spong does is that he  actually proves the resurrection. What he does is he shows you what  happened BEFORE Easter, and then he shows you what happened AFTER Easter.  In my opinion, even the most obtuse person would be able to see that if one  looks at the picture before and after, the resurrection HAD TO HAVE  HAPPENED. This belongs in the library of ANY Roman Catholic or Anglo  Catholic.

Bishop Spong helps to solve this quite vividly. (Even a real  obtuse person could finally understand why the Gospels are so different.)  Mark basically wrote the facts without any other intentions. Matthew wrote  in a way that compared Christ to Moses. (This way the Jews who became  followers of Christ would be able to see Christianity as the fulfillment of  Judaism.) Luke used beautiful images and language. (His goal was to make  peace between the Jews who became followers of Christ and the Gentiles who  became followers of Christ.) John wrote in a hostile tone.

The way we see the present is influenced by our past, as well  as our hopes for the future. Furthermore, our present can influence the way  we see our past. The protagonist in this book has suffered as a daughter, a  sister, a wife, a mother, and a mother in law. She has a son who tries to  be good to her, and she does make a friend now and then, but they can not  help much. You must read this book slowly and carefully.

But what I will  say is that this novel deserves a place in the American Museum of  Literature for several reasons. First of all, Arnow presents us with  dramatic images. Also, she creates an excellent picture of a country family  who is forced out of their element. She then shows all the outside  perseucution they are subject to. And perhaps this is her biggest  accomplishment. Ever since the dawn of the novel, family disputes have been  a major theme. This family faces so many problems from the outside, that  they DO NOT have the luxury of going through a family dispute. Arnow  masterfully shows us the different problems the different characters face  and they suffer as a family. At first, I was a bit worried because of the  size of this book. But the truth is it is never boring. Not only does this  book belong in the museum of Women's Writing, but it also belongs in the  museum of American Classics.	2000-05-03

And I was not overly happy when the teacher assigned this book. But after reading this, I saw that stream of consciousness could be beautiful (if it was handled correctly). The big difference here is that Woolf DOES offer a strong plot that enables her to  use this technique. All of the characters are on some kind of journey to  reach contentment. Obviously the desired contentment varies with the  character, but nevertheless, they all have a common goal. The images of the  lighthouse serves as a medium between the characters. Woolf also gives us  interesting psychological insight into human nature. Now this book is not  the drum I march to. But it was one of my teacher (Ms Worby's) favorites.  And in all honesty, I can understand why. If this is a typical example of  Virginia Woolf's work, she is an outstanding author.	2000-05-03

Clara's vain  attitude contrasts sharply with Miriam's genuine love for the protagonist  Paul. In all honesty this book is never boring. The reason I could not get  overly attached to this is I feel Lawrence lacks the charm that Dickens  always throws into his novels.

Howells was another Nathaniel Hawthorne. But what I can say is that his &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is A LOT better than some books that were made famous (probably for political reasons).  Do not expect the superb images and construction of Hawthorne.  But what we CAN expect is a timeless message about society. At first Silas  is a rich money grubbing monster. (Just think of Dickens' Scrooge.) He  finds ways to cut his friends out of deals, alienates his family with the  want of more money, and even gets his wife upset. Ah, but later things go  bad, and he starts losing money. This is when the human side of him begins  to show and he becomes a very sympathetic character. In my opinion, to  enjoy this even more, you must assume that before the book opens, he WAS a  good and decent man. Once he ran into immense wealth, he grew detestable.  So while, this is not exactly a masterpiece, the degeneration of Silas and  his return to humanity is ample material to carry this book and place it in  the American Museum of Literature.	2000-05-02

The characters are not really that memorable, and Cather does not have the best  orginizational skills. (Or if she does she does not show it in this work.)  On the other hand, there are some things about this book that make it  important in the museum of women's writing. Antonia does not fall into the  traditional pattern women in literature previously did. She has a mind of  her own, she shows that she is capable of taking care of herself, and she  does not have to marry to have the benefit of a happy ending. Yes, she does  marry, but she did not have to. I probably would not buy this book as a  gift for someone.

Moll does not command respect, pity or admiration. The scenes for the most part are not really memorable, and the  supporting characters are not really convincing. Perhaps this is my biggest  complaint. Charles Dickens can keep my interest even in an 800 page book.  Yet Defoe could not hold my interest in 250 pages.

This work lacks the superb construction of Charles Dickens' novels. The images are there, but Austen does not put you there the way Dickens can. Also Austen's work does drag at times even though it is only about half the length of Dickens' full length  books. But aside from that, it is a pretty good novel. The book is  pleasantly funny with some touching moments. Emma herself is well drawn as  a young woman who thinks she knows what is best for everyone, and later  learns that sometimes it is best to let people make their own decisions. In  all honesty, this is not uncommon at all. I find it very interesting that  the recent movie &quot;Clueless&quot; was able to portray this story in a  modern day setting. (The names were all changed, but anyone who read  &quot;Emma&quot; could tell the movie was based on it.) Mr Knightley is  memorable as the embodiement of reason.

I do not have one single complaint about this book. The images are wonderfully portrayed. The main character Tom has many dimensions. He is a rogue, a bumbler, and a womanizer. But at  the same time he is heroic, brave, and honorable. Mr. Allworthy is  memorable as the virtuous guardian of Tom. Sophia is memorable as a woman  with a mind of her own. One of the greatest things about this book is that  even though it is over 800 pages long, it is NEVER boring. We are either in  suspense, feeling pity, feeling sorrow, or trying to control our laughter.  This was the 3rd book I read in History of the Novel. While I did not like  the first 2 at all, I REALLY liked this one. It is interesting that Charles  Dickens mentions this book in his &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850). If  you like this book, you MUST see the movie where Albert Finney plays Tom.	2000-04-30

But what I will call her is a very close runnerup. Bronte masterfully shows us a young girl's growth in an abusive environment to a mature an admirable woman. The images are deep and convincing. The scene  where Jane forgives her abusive aunt is very touching and memorable. Bronte  also strikes us with the complex Rochester. Perhaps Bronte's greatest  accomplishment is how she makes Jane such a Christ like figure. It is  interesting that this novel came out in 1847. It is also possible to wonder  if this work inspired Charles Dickens' masterpiece &quot;David  Copperfield&quot; (1850).	2000-04-30

The only reason I can possibly give for reading this is to see the development of a novel at a very early stage. The plot is stiff, the characters (except for Lovelace) are very 2 dimensional. The material is redundant and gets very boring. The end is far from satisfying. The only  thing that saves this novel from being a complete disaster is Lovelace's  animated character. And even he is poorly handled by Richardson. It would  seem Richardson makes him out to be a villain, and yet he was Clarissa's  only hope. He was the only one who showed any genuine concern for Clarissa.  As much as I love literature, this is one book I literally threw so many  times in frustration. In all honesty, I feel that if Marlowe, Shakespeare,  or Dickens tried to read this, they themselves would get restless and  bored.	2000-04-30

The Land of Lilliput represents a paranoid military society. Brobdingnag represents a pompous culture. The island of Laputa where everyone has high intelligence  and no common sense reflects politicians. The Houyhnhnms represent the most  educated class who are the closest to an ideal society. Now Swift certainly  deserves credit for putting this concept together and this book does  deserve a place in the classic museum of literature. Unfortunately this  book has a sluggish pace. It also lacks the captivating qualities that  Marlowe, Shakespeare, Milton, and Dickens had down to a science. Now if  someone were doing a study of literature throughout the ages, I would say  this book is an important study. On the other hand, this is not a book I  would buy someone as a gift.	2000-04-29

But this  is one French work that offers rare and exquisite beauty. I find it very  interesting that the story starts with mere rumors of the phantom. Later,  we start to see actual things happen. Later, Christina tells Raoul of her  meeting with the phantom. Finally, we see the phantom himself. I must  commend Leroux on the grace in which he maintains a standard narration  style for the most part, but then has the Persian handle the narration at  the appropriate time. To this day, I have never been able to forget how the  Persian turns from a seemingly insignificant character, to a very important  character. Nor have I been able to forget how Leroux handles the phantom.  First he is merely mentioned. Then he is a chilling and terrifying  creature. Finally, he becomes very human and VERY sympathetic. His death  silenced me for days. Interestingly, the phantom is not as unreal as we  might think. There are some men who may have very many wonderful points.  But they are simply cursed as far as being able to establish relations with  women. While the phantom's disfigured face certainly makes the story more  memorable, I am not sure it was crucial. If you like this book, the one  video tape I can recommend is an animated version that is found in the  children's section. YES! It is hard to believe. But with all the versions  out, the most accurate version is the animated one in the children's  section!	2000-04-26

(possibly his third) Yet, there is nothing to indicate he was only starting out. Right away he grabs our attention with the funeral of King Henry V. Henry V's brothers Bedford  and Gloucester help us to see the virtues and strengths of the deceased  king. The Bishop of Winchester is well drawn as a comical villain who plots  and plans, but never succeeds in doing any real damage. (Not until the next  play anyway.) Talbot is memorable as the selfless hero of the play. York is  memorable as the hero who defeats Joan of Arc. King Henry VI himself is  interesting. First we see him as a helpless infant. By the third act, we  see that he has both strengths and weaknesses. He makes the mistake of  dividing the command between the rivals Somerset and York. But also, we see  that he does not tolerate treason or neglect of duty. There are also many  memorable scenes. The garden scene that foreshadows the War of the Roses is  well drawn. The scene where York comforts his dying uncle is tragic beauty.  Bedford's death in 3.2 has almost a divine tone. The death of Talbot and  his son is very lamentable. York's sudden rise to power is captivating.  Perhaps Shakespeare's greatest achievement in this play is that he  simultaneously shows us England's war with France and the dissension with  England itself.	2000-04-26

Nor does it quite match (in my opinion) &quot;The  Pickwick Papers&quot; (1837) or &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838).  Nevertheless, it is an appropriate conclusion to Dickens' writing. The  images are outstanding. The humour is subtle, but very effective. Irony and  surprise events are well placed. Characters such as Bradley Headstone are  captivating. The scene where Eugene and Lizzie marry is a very moving and  memorable scene. Bella is memorable as the girl who loves her parents,  takes a stand for what she feels is right, and then realizes that she was  only being tested. Riderhood is a dark but at the same time likeable. The  Lammels offer a very realistic picture of human nature. Despite their dirty  underhanded tricks, they are a real captivating couple. They can easily get  you on their side even though we know they are villainous. I do not feel  the Jewish character Riah is as memorable or captivating as Fagin from  &quot;Oliver Twist.&quot; But Lizzie is well drawn as a literary  reincarnation of Amy Dorrit. The final scene with Headstone and Riderhood  is frightening and dramatic. The happy ending is also well drawn. While I  can't say this is Dickens' best or the closest runnerup, it is still an  excellent piece of literature. It was also the last novel that Dickens  managed to complete. And for that reason alone, it deserves a special place  in the museum of literature.	2000-04-19

For that reason alone, this play deserves special attention. But the characters, the language, and this interesting situation represent Shakespeare's finest  efforts. Cassius is ruthless with a malicious attitude. But he honestly  fears what Caesar will do if he is crowned. Brutus is a good and honest  man. He contemplates joining Cassius to kill Caesar despite the fact that  Caesar loves him as a friend. (In history as well, Caesar was notably kind  to Brutus.) But yet he too fears that if Caesar is crowned, Rome will  bleed. Mark Antony is convincing as Caesar's  loyal aid who SEEMS  insignificant at first. But after Caesar is killed, he emerges as the most  powerful and intelligent character in the play. What makes this play so  phenomenal is that we can easily understand and sympathize with any of  these major characters. (Even though they are on opposite sides.) What's  left? Only chilling omens like the Soothsayer, the storm, the ghost of  Caesar, etc.  Only memorable passages like Mark Antony's famous 'honorable'  speech. If you like this play, I suggest the B &amp; W version where James  Mason does Brutus, John Gielgud does Cassius, and Marlon Brando does Mark  Antony.	2000-04-14

I feel that too much of  Marlowe's genious takes a back seat to bad humour. Furthermore, Tamburlaine  himself lacks the malignant charm of Faustus. He also does not play on our  sympathy like Edward II. Nor does he have chilling passages like Guise. The  only possible reason I would give for reading this is that it was Marlowe's  first effort. Also, the bad humour allows us to see the mentally disturbed  side of Marlowe. My best advice to anyone who reads this is don't let this  discourage you from reading his great works like &quot;Dido Queen of  Carthage,&quot; &quot;Faustus,&quot; &quot;Massacre At Paris,&quot; or  &quot;Edwatd II.&quot;	2000-04-14

Probably, the only reason I can not give this 5 stars is because I was spoiled by Shakespeare's &quot;The Comedy of Errors.&quot; This is a sparkling piece of art. It is easy to see how Greek Mythology inspired  Shakespeare. The Greek gods have human desires, impulses, and weaknesses.  And often, their people suffer because of them. In this play, several  characters are hindered (although unintentionally) by the bickering Oberon  and Titania. It is easy to see the similarities between Zeus and Hera.

Leontes' initial rage is too sudden and abrupt. Furthermore, there is something too artificial about the happy ending when Shakespeare makes it  clear that Camillo will marry Antigonus' widow Paulina. Antigonus is too  awkwardly dealt with. Remember, Leontes threatened to kill him and his wife  if he did not agree to leave the infant girl in the wilderness. But all of  that aside, the play is an excellent piece of literature. Leontes' rages  are frightening and effective. Furthermore, his regret and repentance is  touching and convincing. Antigonus is memorable as the martyr who offers us  some comical touches. Hermione is fine as the forgiving queen. Perdita and  Florizel are pretty good as the determined young lovers. Camillo deserves  special notice as one of the few level headed characters. First he protects  Polixenes from Leontes' fury, and then he protects Perdita and Florizel  from Polixenes. But the most memorable character could very well be  Autolycus, who in my opinion is a literary reincarnation of Falstaff. This  play does have its weaknesses, but it also has good poetry, drama, comedy,  moments of suspense, interesting surprises, and well developed characters.	2000-04-09

While a certain amount  of violence is required for a good drama, it seems graphic horror is here  for the mere sake of graphic horror. Neither do the villains represent  Shakespeare's best efforts.  Aaron, Tamora, Chiron, or Demetrius are not  chilling or captivating in their evil the way King Richard III is. Nor do  they grab our attention with a crisis of conscience. (Claudius and Macbeth  do) On the positive side, the play moves at a good pace. Lavinia is fine as  the innocent martyr. Saturnius is memorable as the poor man caught in the  middle.

Yet, nothing indicates that he was running out of steam. The images are beautiful. Stephano, Caliban, and Trinculo are memorable as the bumbling conspirators. Miranda and Ferdinand  are fine as the two young lovers. Ariel is striking as Prospero's loyal  servant. Prospero is a magnificent creation. Not only does he offer several  beautiful and memorable passages, but he is well drawn as a character who  was unfairly forced into exile. He also makes his prison his paradise. In  addition, he is a fine representation of Shakespeare himself: &quot;Knowing  I loved my books, he furnished me / From mine own library with volumes that  / I prize above my dukedom&quot; (1.2.166-168). His speeches in 4.1 and 5.1  also reflect how Shakespeare himself was contemplating the end of his  career. The story itself is very well drawn. Shakespeare grabs our  attention with a storm at sea. He offers us a reflection of himself,  comical touches, beautiful images, profound passages, beautiful language,  young lovers, comical villains, and deep messages.

Even if you have read a lot of Shakespeare's plays, this  one is difficult and demands much effort to follow. But, if you can push yourself into reading this, it is well worth the time. Shakespeare himself  performed the role of Berowne. While this is a comedy, the humour relies on  irony as opposed to funny events. Also, unlike his other comedies, this one  does not end in utter happieness. The interaction of the characters, as  well as the situation comedy (especially in 4.3) is quite memorable.

Generally speaking, I do not like to compare Hawthorne and Dickens. However, this is probably the ONE TIME American Literature CAME THIS CLOSE to the fine masterpieces of  Europe. Like Dickens, Hawthorne presents us with profound and chilling  images. As Dickens presents us historical backgrounds and realistic  pictures of Victorian England, Hawthorne does so (except with Puritan  America.) As Dickens offers us deep psychological insights into human  nature, so does Hawthorne. Hepzibah is fine as the poor woman who is out of  place and needs to survive somehow and take care of her brother Clifford.  Clifford is memorable as the character who teaches us about a second chance  at youth, and who has to later take care of Hepzibah. Phoebe is touching as  the innocent young woman who brings what cheer she can. Jaffrey is  frightening as the villain who wants the mysterious lost treasure AT ANY  COST. Chapter 18 not only offers a unique narration style, but is probably  the most terrifying moment in all of Hawthorne's writing. As frightening  and tragic as this story seems, Hawthorne manages to offer us a happy  ending. If you are not that familiar with Hawthorne, you may do good to  read Chapter 13 FIRST. The events in Chapter 13 take place before  anything  else.	2000-04-08

The only reason I was exposed to his first novel  &quot;Fanshawe&quot; (1828) was that I majored in English. I think when we  are only exposed to their selected best works, we fail to remember that  even the BEST writers like Marlowe and Shakespeare were human. And as  humans, NOT EVERY SINGLE THING they write can be a masterpiece. So why read  &quot;Fanshawe?&quot; Well, this first novel shows us the greatness to  come. We are presented with memorable and chilling images. Ellen is  memorable as the typical damsel in distress. Fanshawe and Edward Walcott  are captivating as the rivals for Ellen's love who put their differences  aside to save her. The Angler is captivating as a villain who offers some  interesting passages and is not quite a monster. And Hawthorne manages to  speed things up with a wild chase and bitter confrontation. To be sure,  this does not represent Hawthorne's best efforts, but do we really know an  author if we only read his best works? This novel helps us see the  greatness that was to come.	2000-04-08

The humour is well drawn when Olivia falls in love with Viola's male  disguise. Also, there is some strong comedy when Viola makes some  characters angry and her brother Sebastian (who resembles Viola's male  identity) suffers the consequences. But the play also has some really  touching moments. Viola as a man faces the hard task of assisting Orsino in  his persuit of Olivia, even though she wants Orsino for herself.

When I had a better understanding of Shakespeare, I gave it a2nd chance and realized it was excellent. At times it moves slow, but that is only because Shakespeare is trying to present several events. First we have a realistic dispute between two brothers. We also have a wicked duke who stole his brother's kingdom. The banished duke and his loyal followers are memorable as they praise life in the wilderness. Jaques offers the memorable passage on the 7 stages of man. Rosalind is very captivating as the banished duke's daughter. 5.2 is poetically and comically drawn when poor Rosalind has to keep telling Phebe she is for no woman. There is even a tribute to Christopher Marlowe in this play when Phebe attributes a line from Marlowe's &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; to a dead shepherd. (Marlowe died before this play.) But perhaps Shakespeare's greatest accomplishment is gathering all of these characters with their different circumstances together.  END	2000-04-08

It  lacks the superb construction of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing.&quot; Even  though it is a comedy, it lacks the hilarious tone of &quot;The Comedy of  Errors.&quot; And at times, it seems drawn out.

Isabella is memorable as the woman who has to  choose between giving up her condemned brother or allowing the corrupt  Angelo to use her for sex. The drunk Barnadine offers some interesting dark  humour. The Duke is captivating as he disuises himself as a priest to check  out the events. He also offers a memorable soliloquy in 3.2.

The roots for this novel can be found in Hawthorne's short story  &quot;Endicott and the Red Cross.&quot; This exquisite work shows us a  harsh and brutally realistic picture of Puritan America. Hester draws much  sympathy as the woman who suffers way too much persecution for her crime of  infidelity. Dimmesdale is memorable as the guilty lover who tries to  advocate for Hester when the authorities want to take Hester's illegitimate  child away. He also offers a very moving passage in XVII when he openly  confesses to us (the readers) his guilt. Pearl is captivating as the  product of Hester and Dimmesdale's affair. While as a child she can not  figure out exact details, she CAN make connections between facts. Roger  (Hester's husband) is perhaps Hawthorne's greatest creation. He offers a  very chilling and memorable passage in IV when he confronts Hester and  reveals his identity to us. He is by far the most intelligent character in  the book. Furthermore, his careful investigations contrast strikingly with  the other characters breakdowns and outbursts. Hawthorne increases the  complexity of this phenomenal character when Roger leaves his wealth to  Hester despite her affair. Another fine aspect of this book is the way in  which Hawthorne gradually unfolds the major facts and gives us time to  figure them out before he flat out tells the crucial happenings.	2000-04-08

The  play seems to delight in his death, when he had nothing to do with the  wickedness of his wife. Nor did he approve of it.   Nevertheless, it is  easy to see why this play has always been very popular. Pericles is a well  developed character. First we see him as a youth jousting for the love of  his life. Although not much time passes, we are somehow given the  impression that he has aged. He becomes a father and he 'believes' he has  become a widower. It is interesting how he changes from a typical teenage  lovestruck youth to an adult concerned over his 'motherless' daughter. When  he thinks his daughter is dead, he is reduced to an old man's solitary  state. When he is reunited with his wife and daughter, it is almost as if  he is young again. Marina is memorable as Pericles' virtuous daughter.  Helicanus is striking as Pericles' loyal servant who is no flatterer. Cleon  is sympathetic as the decent man who is destroyed by his wife Dionyza's  wickedness. So, we have some interesting characters, a man's growth, good  images, comical touches, a sudden dilemna, and a happy ending. In my  opinion, this was Shakespeare's attempt at a fairy tale. If you read this  (knowing not to expect his best efforts) you may be pleasantly surprised.	2000-04-04

Like &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; we have a protagonist (Imogen) who falls under her father's rages because she  will not marry who he wants her to. Like &quot;Much Ado About  Nothing,&quot; we have a villain (Iachimo) who tries to convince a man  (Posthumus) that the woman he loves is full of infidelity. Like &quot;As  You Like It,&quot; we have exiled people who praise life in the wilderness  and a woman who disguises herself as a man to search for her family in the  wilderness. Like &quot;King Lear,&quot; we have a king who's rages and  miscaculated judgement lead to disastorous consequences. What else is  there? Only beautiful language, multiple plots, an evil queen who tries to  undermind the king, an action filled war, suspense, a dream with visions of  Pagan gods, and a beautiful scene of reconciliation at the end. While this  is certainly one of Shakespeare's longer plays, it is well worth the time.	2000-04-03

But this is hardly fair. Even with the world's finest writers such as Marlowe and Dickens, not every single thing they write can be a masterpiece. But what makes &quot;The Two Gentleman of Verona&quot; worth  reading? Well,  Shakespeare presents us with a valid theme. (Conflicts  often exist between romance and friendship.) There is also beautiful  language. Launce and his dog offer some interesting comedy as well as a  beautiful and memorable passage in 2.3. The scene where Valentine is  accepted amonst the outlaws is memorable. This is Shakespeare's first play  where a woman (Julia) disuises herself as man to do some investigating. It  is also easy to see that several elements of this play were used in  &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; To be sure, this is not a masterpiece like  &quot;The Comedy of Errors,&quot; &quot;Richard III,&quot; or &quot;King  Lear.&quot; But it is still an good study that is worth some interest.	2000-04-03

Don John is interesting as the villain who simply can not tolerate people's happieness. While this is rare, it DOES exist. Hero is fine as the docile  and submissive woman who grants Claudio a merciful and blessed 2nd chance.  Beatrice is captivating as the quick witted woman who can not be outspoken  and is intelligent enough to recognize Don John's mischief. The priest is  striking as the man who can spot Don John's evil and offers an intelligent  plan that brings salvation to the end of the play. Dogberry offers some  welcome comical touches as the bumbling but also effective officer.  Benedick is wonderful. First he is a bumbling character who can not stand  women. He is quickly outwitted by Beatrice and he falls for Don Pedro's and  Claudio's plan to get him and Beatrice together. He offers a hilarious  soliloquy on the perfect woman. But he is not a weakling. When Hero is  wronged by Don John's evil, he boldly resigns from Don Pedro's service and  challanges Claudio to a duel. But leave it to Shakespeare to resolve  everything and offer us a happy ending. Great comedy, a sudden dilemna,  beautiful language, and a happy ending make this play another of  Shakespeare's triumphs!	2000-04-03

I don't feel &quot;Macbeth&quot; quite matches &quot;Hamlet&quot; or &quot;King Lear.&quot; Nevertheless, it is a phenomenal piece of literature. The witches add a chilling demonic feature. It is interesting  that even though they deceive Macbeth, they do not tell complete  falsehoods. Except for the crimes of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, they are  actually a real likeable couple. They stand by each other and cover each  other's mistakes. We can see that their marriage is a successful one. Also,  unlike Richard III or Goneril, they do not have the gift of blankness. They  clearly regret their actions and suffer for them. Duncan is well drawn as a  benevolent and virtuous king who is too trusting. Malcolm is fine as a  sharper version of his father. King James' ancestor Banquo is well drawn as  a virtuous general who is sharp enough to see through the witches'  flattering promises, and eventually returns from the dead to confront his  killer. Macduff and Siward are fine as the 2 Dimensional champions of good.  The drunken porter offers us a few welcome laughs. Ross and Angus are  interesting in that their gradual change from being supporters of Macbeth  to enemies of Macbeth emphasize Macbeth's degeneration. Seyton is fine as  the man who remains loyal to Macbeth to the end. Lennox is interesting as  the man who never swallowed the 'official story' of Duncan's death. He says  that Duncan was murdered by: &quot;Those of his chamber, AS IT  SEEMED....&quot; (2.3.119). Being the cautious man he is, he waits until an  absurd 'official story' of Banquo's death comes out before he becomes an  enemy of Macbeth. So we have chilling images, lots of action, 3 D  protagonists, good characters, evil characters, suspicious characters,  naive characters, malignant forces, historical foundations, memorable  passages, and even some comic relief. If you like this play, I suggest the  B &amp; W production with Orson Welles as  Macbeth.	2000-04-02

It is full of convincing characters, dark images, dark humour, and memorable passages. Through Jasper, we are able to see a side of Dickens himself. In one of Dickens' Christmas Books that takes place at an  Inn, a character (who I suspect is a representation of Dickens) himself is  jealous of a character named Edwin. Interestingly this repeats here. It is  also interesting that after Dickens and his wife seperated, he fell in love  with a younger woman. Jasper is attracted to a younger woman. It is also  striking that in his dying written words, there are many images of  graveyards. Even though Dickens died before he could finish this, it is an  interesting work. There are many elements that make this book worth looking  at. (Interesting dialogues, convincing characters, comical touches, good  and dark images, a representation of Dickens himself, etc.) These are also  Dickens' final words, and for that reason alone, this book deserves a  special place in the museum of literature.	2000-04-02

When I first read &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853) I thought it was slow reading. When I finished it and saw how everything came together, I considered it a phenomenal masterpiece. Along with &quot;Dombey and  Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), and &quot;Hard  Times&quot; (1854) this is a personal favorite of mine. There are very  comical moments. Also there are journeys through the poor parts of London.  We are also presented with chilling images as well as a murder mystery.  Another well drawn part of this masterpiece is the protagonist's painful  realization of her questionable birth. There is a dramatic chase through  the snow and well placed dramatic irony. While this book may seem to move  slow, it will get easier as you proceed.	2000-04-01

While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak  House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a  phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we  see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in  law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is  interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his  own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way  into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo  has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical  touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate  colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In  my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this  day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief  in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic  quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and  surprise events!	2000-04-01

I don't understand how they would explain that this is by  far his most popular work and yet it is only 1/8 the length of his normal  books. This is a masterpiece in that it shows us the harsh reality that  some people are so hardened that not even Christmas moves them. I also feel  Dickens displays his best skills when he shows us that Scrooge was not  always this way. Also, Scrooge starts to change when he is exposed to his  present. Seeing upclose what his greedieness has done to Cratchit catches  his conscience. Furthermore he realizes that many people will be delighted  at his eventual death if he does not change. The messages are very  profound. In addition, we are presented with striking images. Also,  characters such as Jacob Marley,  Fanny, Fred, and Mr. Fezziwig, and the  ghosts are very convincing. Again, Dickens shows us the harsh conditions of  Victorian England. Also, Dickens emphasizes that even a hardened miser CAN  change. If you like this book, Dickens Christmas Book &quot;The Cricket on  the Hearth&quot; may also interest you.	2000-04-01

But it is easy to see why Dickens felt that this was his best  creation. First we get to see David as a helpless child. Then we see him  grow into a man.  It is interesting that David's Aunt has to take him in  when he runs away from his abusive stepfather. Then when his aunt loses her  property, David has to take her in. David's childish wife Dora provides an  interesting contrast to the mature Agnes. Mr. Micawber is a great creation.  (in my opinion a combination of Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Brownlow). Not only is  he a good honest man, but he provides several comical moments. The scene  when he rages against &quot;HEEP&quot; is one of the funniest moments in  Dickens' writings. So we have powerful drama, strong images, a child's  growth into a man, convincing characters, and even laughs. True, this book  is almost 900 pages. But the fact that Dickens felt this was his best  creation should motivate anyone to read this masterpiece!	2000-04-01

This 2nd novel of his certainly emphasizes the harsh conditions of Victorian England. Also, this novel demonstrates his cynical  sense of humour. He also demonstrates his skill of creating dramatic irony.  Fagin (the so called villain) treats Oliver and the other boys much better  than the legitimate firms. Also, Dickens portrays an interesting contrast.  One one hand, we have the frightening psychopath Bill Sikes. On the other  hand, Fagin clearly DOES have a conscience. (This is clearly displayed when  Sikes goes into a rage and Fagin expresses his concern.) It is also  interesting that the legitimate firms abuse Oliver and the other boys  without a second thought. I can not overemphasize the grace in which  Dickens makes Fagin's death very slow, tragic, and painful for us. We also  have altruistic characters such as Mr. Brownlow and Rose. Characters such  as Mr. Grimwig add some welcome comical touches. So we have strong images,  a bitter representation of the period, comical touches, dramatic irony, and  well drawn tragic scenes. Enjoy!	2000-03-31

Goneril, Regan, Cornwall, and Edmund are the most frightening  and demonic characters in Shakespeare's writing. (Only his King Richard III  compares). I can not overemphasize Shakespeare's mastery of writing in how  he gradually unfolds the evil of these characters. While we may not know  what to think of them at first, we soon learn that they would do Satan  proud. Lear is handled well. First we don't know what to think of him, but  then we are moved into VERY DEEP AND INTENSE pity for him. Cordelia, Kent,  and Edgar are three of the most Christ like characters in Shakespeare's  writings. The virtuous Albany also displays Shakespeare's best skills.  First we hardly see him, but other characters express Albany's contempt for  the diabolical Cornwall several times. In 4.2, his fury at his demonic wife  shows us that he is planning a bold countermove. By 5.3, Albany actually  takes on all 3 of the remaining monstrously evil characters. Shakespeare  also offers us powerful dramatic irony with the fool. He also offers us  powerful (and very terrifying)  images. There are also several moving  passages in this play. (Especially Edgar's soliloquy 3.6.111-125). Somehow,  Shakespeare even managed to squeeze some welcome comical touches in.	2000-03-26

I once read that Shakespeare wrote this play not so much for profit, but to reflect the conflict of different theatres. This would certainly explain why the play lacks his usual orginization and focus. Perhaps he was  inspired by Christopher Marlowe's &quot;Dido Queen of Carthage&quot; to  combine the timeless Greek Mythology and his mastery of the language. But  despite the lesser impact, orginization, and focus of Marlowe's attempt at  this, the play is worth reading. Shakespeare offers a valid theme.  (Personal interest is often the root of civil chaos.) There is some well  placed comedy. Classic characters of Greece such as Agamemnon have some  striking passages. When total war breaks out, the images are quite  memorable. After the Trojans are defeated, Troilus' final speech of revenge  is a satisfying conclusion. If you like this play, you may wish to read  Marlowe's &quot;Dido Queen of Carthage&quot; afterwards. The events in  Marlowe's play would follow the events in this play.	2000-03-26

Like  Marlowe and Shakespeare, Milton demonstrates extreme scholarship and a  superb mastery of the language. It is interesting how Milton takes figures  that are mentioned briefly in the scriptures and turns them into major  characters. It is also frightening how Milton was able to make God and  Satan 3 dimensional as opposed to simply good (in God's case) and evil (in  Satan's case). This book is not for everyone. But if you do not mind an  unorthodox portrayal of God and Satan and if you want to enjoy beautiful  language, superb images, dramatic confrontations, and powerful images, you  must read this masterpiece composed with superb and delicate skill.	2000-03-26

At first, Barabas is a  sympathetic character, but like many of Marlowe's characters, he goes too  far and becomes detestable. Barabas' daughter Abigail is a striking figure.  She initially feels sorry for her father but later sees what he has become  and falls victim to her father's wickedness. Her death as a Christain in  3.6 is memorable. Ithamore is convincing as a villain who knows no honor.  Ferneze is fine as the hero who eventually restores order. It's not  Marlowe's best play, but it is still worth some interest.	2000-03-25

Falstaff is funnier than ever. King Henry IV's younger son Lancaster is a very striking figure. While his father is ill, he commands the forces against his father's  enemies. 3.1 where King Henry IV contemplates the consequences of the crown  he usurped from Richard II is quite moving. The scene where Lancaster  crushes the last of his father's opposition is quite chilling. I can not  overestimate Shakespeare's genious in how he handles Henry IV in this play.  In &quot;Richard II&quot; his ambition and cruelty for the most part never  ceased. In &quot;1 Henry IV,&quot; he showed himself to be a competent (and  even likeable) king. In this play, he clearly regrets and suffers for his  actions against Richard II. (Even if we remember his cruelty in  &quot;Richard II,&quot; it is hard not to feel sorry for him at this  point.) The scene where King Henry IV has his final talk with the eventual  Henry V is one of the most moving passages in literature. King Henry V's  complete reform is not only well drawn, but it helps prepare us for the  next play, &quot;Henry V.&quot; But if you want to see more of Falstaff,  remember he has the lead role in the later play &quot;The Merry Wives of  Windsor.&quot;	2000-03-25

Jupiter (or Zeus) offers a powerful opening when he promises to aid the survivng Trojans including Aeneas. The triangle between Dido,  Aneas, and Iarbus serves to keep us in suspense. The regrouping of the  survivng Trojans is a memorable scene. Aeneas' telling of the war in 2.1 is  dramatic and powerful. (Especially when he blames himself for allowing the  Trojan Horse into their gates.) Juno (or Hera) is chilling as the venomous  woman she usually is. Iarbas and Anna draw sympathy as victims of  unrequited love. The tragic parting of Aeneas and Dido is quite moving, and  the triple suicide of Dido, Iarbas, and Anna is a sorrowful, chilling, and  yet beautifully done ending. Only Marlowe could follow up Homer's Trojan  War with a sequel of this outstanding quality!	2000-03-25

Shakespeare deserves much credit for making the villain in &quot;Richard II&quot; (King Henry IV) the hero in this play. It is in this play that King Henry IV realizes political gratitude is short lived and  Richard's prediction of Henry IV's trials comes true. Not only does King  Henry IV realize that his seizing the crown came with consequences. but he  also has to deal with his riotous son (the eventual Henry V). 3.2, where  King Henry IV confronts his undisciplined son is quite memorable. Besides  all this, Shakespeare introduces us to his comical Falstaff. So we have an  interesting turn of events, dramatic confrontations, scenes of war, and  comical touches. ENJOY!	2000-03-25

The problem is that this lacks Marlowe's superb orginization,  harsh realities, dramatic irony, and chilling terror. Don't get me wrong.

This is soon followed by York's conspiracy to seize the crown himself. Later we are offered some comical  touches with a false miracle. Some chilling pagan prophecies also grab our  attention. Also Later, there is the hard passage where Gloucester uncovers  the treason of his wife and later stands trial and is found guilty of  crimes he is innocent of. Later his corpse is discovered. Shakespeare does  not stop here! There is the chilling triangle between King Henry VI, Queen  Margaret, and her lover Suffolk. King Henry VI is at his best in the  trilogy when he banishes the vile Suffolk and faces down his queen. The  scene where the delirious cardinal confesses his guilt is a scene of horror  followed by Henry's touching forgiveness. The rebel Jack Cade  simultaneously offers comedy and horror. His death at the hands of Iden is  artfully drawn. But Shakespeare does not stop here! The War of the Roses  actually starts.The demonic Richard III actually makes his first appearance  in this play.

York's death in  1.4 is another landmark in Shakespeare's writing. The scene (2.5) where  Henry finds true terror  is horror, sorrow, and yet beauty and yet another  moving part of the play. (The son that hath killed his father and the  father that hath killed his son.) The war pauses in disaster for Henry and  some comic relief is offered. But the horror starts all over again when  Edward IV and Warwick have a falling out. The war starts over again, and  the King of France gets involved! The scene where King Henry VI is  reinstated is a scene of beauty and hope. While all of this is happening,  Shakespeare carefully prepares the monstrously satanic character of Richard  III. From here, the play just gets more and more bloody. A final moment of  horror is offered when the eventual Richard III proudly compares himself to  the one who betrayed Christ.

In this chilling masterpiece, not a single page is wasted. This play offers several dramatic passages. Guise's soliloquy in scene 2 is especially powerful.  Another aspect of this play that Marlowe handles with the utmost of genius  is Anjou's rise to King Henry III, and later his fall. Throughout the play,  Guise presents us with chilling moments and his death is handled with  dramatically appropriate lines. The reconciliation between King Henry III  and Navarre also demonstrates Marlowe's mastery of literature. Finally,  King Henry III's death really helps us to see that Marlowe paved the way  for Shakespeare in every sense of the word.

This is not a simple tale where the moral is not to judge people by looks!  Hugo masterfully shows us a tragic but interesting dilemna. Claude Frollo is holy and  virtuous enough to take care of an abandoned and physically deformed child.  Yet, despite his virtue, he is unable to control his sexual frustrations  towards the gypsy woman. It is also interesting that despite the kindness  Quasimodo shows towards La Esmeralda, she can hardly look at him. Hugo  masterfully increases our sorrow when Quasimodo sees her beauty and feels  all the more ugly: &quot;I never realized how ugly I am until now.&quot; It  is also striking that the gypsies are sympathetic at first, but then their  actions go to far and the soldiers of the church have no choice but to take  direct action. Another phenomenal aspect of this book is that even though  Claude Frollo shows his dark side, Hugo does not permit us to forget his  good points. (Especially when Hugo shows the ingratitude of Claude Frollo's  delinquent brother after all the kindness he treated him with.) Hugo  presents us with striking images, powerful drama, convincing characters,  some comic relief, tragic recognition and reversal, and harsh realities.  Not one page is wasted. The harsh ending where Quasimodo sees everything he  loved destroyed and leaves the cathedral in pure sorrow left me silent for  days.  If you are open to reading this in Quasimodo's and Claude Frollo's  light (not in a modern light) I highly recommend this exquisite masterpiece  beyond expectations. I DO NOT recommend the DISNEY version. Someone lent it  to me, and I was so enraged at the destruction of Hugo's intentions that I  would have loved to burn the tape. Read the book instead, or at least find  a movie that tells the story the way Hugo wrote it!	2000-03-14
US	49979986	RBPIY3CB6HE0T	0521409462	43217624	King Richard II (Cambridge School Shakespeare)	Books	4	7	11	N	N	So close to a masterpiece!	My only complaint about this play is that Shakespeare should have had some dialogues where the characters discussed crucial history before the play opens. Gloucester (murdered or dead before the play but mentioned several  times) had tried to usurp Richard's crown too many times. History itself is  not sure if Gloucester died or was murdered. Bolingbroke for a while  conspired with Gloucester and now sees another oppurtunity to usurp the  crown.The virtuous John of Gaunt served Richard with honor and integrity  and eventually moved parliament into arresting Gloucester for treason. This  would of made John of Gaunt's rages all the more valid. Otherwise this play  is outstanding! Richard shows himself to be capable of ruling at times, but  gains our contempt when he seizes his the honorable John of Gaunt's wealth.  John of Gaunt's final rage in 2.1 is a passage of immense rageful beauty.  Also, Shakespeare moves us into strongly suspecting that Richard had  Gloucester murdered. However, despite Richard's crime, Shakespeare  masterfully reverses our feelings and moves us into having deep pity for  Richard when he is deposed. The Bishop of Carlisle (Richard's true friend)  provides some powerful passages of his own. I can not overestimate the  grace in which Shakespeare increases our new won pity for Richard when  Bolingbroke (Gaunt's rightful heir) regains his wealth and the death of  Gloucester is left ambiguous. 5.1, when Richard sadly leaves his queen and  can see that Henry IV and his followers will eventually divide is a scene  of sorrowful beauty. 5.4 is chilling when Exton plots Richard's murder. 5.5  is chilling and captivating when Richard dies but manages to take two of  the thugs down with him. The icing on the cake is that Bolingbroke (Henry  IV) can only regret his actions and realize that he has gotten himself into  a troublesome situation. But that will be covered in &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;  and &quot;2 Henry IV.&quot; We can easily argue that it is in &quot;Richard  II&quot; where we see Shakespeare's mastery of the language at its finest.	2000-03-14

Richard III is the most well crafted satanic character in all of Shakespeare's writing. What can get frightening is that you see his evil, and yet you like him. The play is dramatically frightening from one scene to the next. To this day, I never could forget the scene where Hastings is  sentenced to death or when Richard is haunted by the 11 ghosts. But the  virtuous Henry VII also offers captivating passages (especially his passage  that announces the end of the War of the Roses.) It is also interesting to  see how carefully Shakespeare had to handle Henry VII, seing his  granddaughter Elizabeth was in the audience. To be sure, Richard III is  blamed for several things he did not do. The dramatic irony is that  whatever he was innocent of, all the circumstancial evidence says he  murdered his nephews.(Rumors that he killed them continued to spread like  fire. Not only did he start losing England's loyalty, but many of his own  followers in a rage abandoned him and joined Henry VII. France began to  humiliate Richard by broadcasting official accusations and Richard never so  much as denied having done it. If he could have produced the princes, his  troubles would have been over.)This one vile deed made it possible for  Shakespeare to make Richard this monster from hell and convincingly pile a  slew of vile deeds upon him of which he was innocent. But all that aside,  women such as Richard's furious mother and the raging former Queen Margaret  add to the drama and chills. The gradual unfolding of Margaret's curses  adds a charming orginizational bonus to this masterpiece. If you want to  enjoy this play all the more, make sure you read &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;  first. Richard's demonic nature is heavily prepared in this preceeding  play.	2000-03-14

He is a brave and valiant soldier. Yet, he has contempt for the people he protects. In all honesty this is very common. Shakespeare  never allows the intensity of this play to drop for a moment. At first  Coriolanus fights to the extreme for Rome. Then he fights to the extreme  against Rome. His reconciliation with his former enemy Aufidius in 4.5 is a  very memorable scene. Only when he is confronted by his mother, wife, and  son does he go through a crisis of conscience. It is interesting that  because he begins to see the world in terms other than himself, his  downfall becomes inevitable. To be sure, this play is not a masterpiece  like &quot;Julius Caesar,&quot; &quot;Hamlet,&quot; &quot;King Lear,&quot;  or &quot;Richard III.&quot; But it is A LOT BETTER than some of his popular  plays like &quot;Othello&quot; or &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; I highly  suggest it!	2000-03-13

In my opinion too much of the play revolves around a doting mother who wants to see her underage son on the throne even though he is very  incapable of ruling. Furthermore, any intelligent observer can see that the  King of France only wants Arthur on the crown because a child would be a  lot easier to manipulate than the shrewd King John. Remember, John WAS NOT  a usurper. Richard the Lionhearted named John as the heir to the crown! On  the positive side, Richard I's illegitimate son is a powerful and  convincing character. John is an interesting 3 dimensional character. At  times he comes off as  harsh and cruel. But he also shows himself at times  to be  to be a strong and competent king. And at times we can feel sorry  for him. Shakespeare also manages to squeeze some comical touches in. I  feel that to appreciate this play as much as possible, you must realize  that Richard I named John the heir to the crown. I also feel you must  understand that John did prove himself to be a competent king. (Unlike his  unfairly blackened reputation in &quot;Robin Hood.&quot;)	2000-03-13

This play offers  several memorable speeches, including Henry's orations in 3.1 and 4.3. In  2.2, we can see how effective Henry is against treason. I could not forget  4.1 if I tried. The scene where King Henry V disguises himself as a soldier  and shares the burdens of his troops is a scene of such rare beauty (even  to me an English Major)!  And yet, Shakespeare still manages to squeeze in  some comical touches. To be sure this is history, but Shakespeare paints  the picture with his mastery of the language very well. If Shakespeare had  not written &quot;1 Henry VI,&quot; &quot;2 Henry VI,&quot; or  &quot;Richard III,&quot; I probably would have given this 5 stars.	2000-03-10

To be sure, there are profound insights into human nature. The characters are convincing. There is beautiful symbolism as well as dramatic irony. In all  honesty this is an excellent piece of work. What I do not understand though  is why this is more popular than his profound and more organized works such  as &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848) and &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854). I  certainly feel &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1859) is a great book.

The comedy is  rich, but the story is also well constructed. Portia'passage on mercy (4.1) is one of the most unforgettable passages in Shakespeare's writings. I can not overestimate  Shakespeare's brilliance in the way he constructs the dramatic irony of  this play. Shylock's emphasis on the letter of the law over mercy leads to  his own downfall. I feel this play was a bold move on Shakespeare's part.  To be sure, it is a great play in itself, but I suspect there is more. I  can not help but think the Gospels inspired Shakespeare in the writing of  this play. It is almost as if Shylock represents the Jewish authorities and  Portia represents Christ. To elaborate further, Antonio may have been  derived from the cripple that Christ heals. So leave it to Shakespeare! A  comical play, a good story, memorable passages, and divine roots all rolled  into one. Shakespeare, I salute you!	2000-03-08

One scene I could not forget if I  tried is when Ford feels bad for suspecting his wife, is humiliated in  front of everyone, and apologizes.Only a bit later he finds his wife was  with Falstaff and she has another arranged meeting with him!

To be sure, the play contains some powerful drama, irony, well placed comic relief, and an interesting situation. But the main  characters are way to shallow.

It is comical that the 2 rival suitors for Bianca are able to work together to  get Kate married somehow so as to free the &quot;seemingly sweet&quot;  Bianca for possible marriage. Petruchio (Kate's eventual husband) offers us  a comical passage in 2.1. Another humorous aspect of this play is all the  alias identities. Lucentio alias Cambio, Tranio alias Lucentio,  and Pedant  alias Vincentio. I can not overemphasize Shakespeare's brilliance when all  seems well. Towards the end, Petruchio and Kate seem to be doing fine and  Lucentio and Bianca will marry. But leave it to Shakespeare. Vincentio  (Lucentio's father) goes to visit his son only to be locked out of his  son's house by Pedant alias Vincentio. This hilarious scene is such a  perfect climatic point. We are exposed to comedy and tension simultaneously  when the play suddenly becomes violent.

To be sure, the dramatic events in this play really did happen, but Marlowe shows himself at his  best when he paints the picture. At first, Marlowe masterfully allows us to  detest Edward for undoing all the fine work of his father Edward  Longshanks. We also are able to feel sorry for Mortimer and Isabella. (the  eventual villains). Isabella feels neglected and Mortimer can not stand to  see the fine work of Edward Longshanks undone.  Later, we come to have some  respect for Edward II when he shows himself to have some of his father's  fine qualities and he crushes the first rebellion against him with courage  and intelligence. When the second uprising successful, we no longer are  lead into any feelings of admiration for Mortimer and Isabella. Once they  have power they are more vile and disgusting than Edward II ever was. By  Act 5.1, Marlowe gives Edward II moving soliloquies and does not allow our  new won pity to slack for a moment. The final scene of this play when  Edward II's 17 year old son Edward III flips the tables,  crushes his  corrupt mother, has Mortimer put to death, and offers prayers to his  murdered father is a scene that is almost unsurpassed in literature. To be  sure, this did actually happen, but Marlowe not only tells us what  happened, but colors it with his superb mastery of the language.	2000-03-07

I do not feel Marlowe's &quot;Faustus&quot; is quite as good as his &quot;Massacre at Paris&quot; or &quot;Edward II,&quot; but I still consider it an outstanding play. &quot;Faustus&quot; is very true to life  in that many people can not stay behind the 'this far and no further  point.' The opening is quite chilling as Faustus decides that the  legitimate knowledge of this world is not good enough and he immediately  decides to cross into forbidden territory even at the expense of his soul.  To this day, I never have forgotten the chills I felt in 2.1 when Faustus  signs the unholy contract. It is interesting that even after Faustus signs  the contract, that he is presented with several oppurtunities to escape his  fate: &quot;Faustus, repent; yet God will pity thee&quot; (2.2.12). But he  can not give up the fruits of the contract. (His powers, having  Mephostophilis at his command, etc.) After the chilling tension of the  first 2 acts, Marlowe releases the tension for the next two acts by having  Faustus perform several practical jokes (of an evil nature to be sure), but  nevertheless it offers a release of tension while at the same time we can  see how malignant Faustus has become. I once read that many people feel the  3rd and 4th act are way too silly and that they drag the play down. But I  don't think this is the case at all. I can not help but think Marlowe was  trying to point out that in all honesty, there was a worthless aspect of  the fruits Faustus sold his soul for. Furthermore, Acts 3 and 4 help us to  see the mentally disturbed side of Christopher Marlowe himself. In 5.1,  Faustus has 1 final chance to avoid his fate, but he resolves himself to  damnation after enjoying Helen of Troy. If I were a betting man I would be  willing to wage that Marlowe is pointing out that sex is an ultimate  driving force. To this day, I have never been able to forget the final  soliloquy of despair in 5.2 followed by the demons carrying Faustus off to  hell. Marlowe himself dedicated much of his life to blasphemy, and I can  not help but feel he was coming to terms with the church and starting to  realize he better cut it out or else. Not only is this an excellent play,  but it also helps us to take a look at Marlowe himself.	2000-03-05

While I do not consider it a 5 star book, it shows many sides of Dickens. It shows the harsh conditions of Victorian  England very well. But it also exposes us to Dickens cynical sense of  humor. One case is where the magistrate who is suppose to judge a case is  comically unaware of the case. Also Dickens presents us with dramatic irony  in that Fagin (the thief) treats his boys better than the legitimate firms.  Dickens also provides us with a wide variety of characters.  Also, Dickens  provides us with an interesting situation in that it is clear that the  legitimate firms do not hesitate in their abuse to Oliver. Fagin clearly  DOES have a conscience. His concern for Oliver is genuine when Bill Sikes  goes into his psychopathic rages. Furthermore, Dickens makes sure we feel a  slow and agonizing pain when Fagin is arrested and doomed to die.	2000-03-04

This is one play where the laughs never stop. What makes this so phenomenal is that Shakespeare conducts the &quot;errors&quot; or mistaken identities almost the way a good director may conduct a dance. Also, while he  maintains the spirited comedy throughout, he also builds the tension. First  the &quot;errors&quot; only lead to comical confusion and  misunderstandings. Later, the &quot;errors&quot; cause Antipholus of  Ephesus to suspect his wife is cheating on him. (If you ask me he had  better grounds for suspecting this then the so called noble Othello. After  all poor Antipholus of Ephesus was locked out of his own house!) By Act  4.1, the &quot;errors&quot; get more serious. Two innocent people get  arrested. By the end of act 4, the &quot;errors&quot; have gotten so  intense and out of hand, that not one or two, but SEVERAL of the characters  are in serious danger of being physically hurt! But leave it to Shakespeare  to resolve everything, and manage to end the play in utter comedy and joy!	2000-03-04

Even when he tries to prevent  himself from acting on his desire to be king, his wife pushes him. But once  the deed is done, his wife begins to weaken and he has to push himself all  the harder to hold on to what he was reluctant to strive for in the first  place. I also find it striking that Macbeth realizes that his murder makes  an eventual fallout with his friend Banquo inevitable. So then he has to  have him killed secretly. It is masterfully crafted in that when Macbeth  sees the ghost of Banquo (who suspected Macbeth of murdering Duncan)  Macbeth suddenly realizes that Macduff also suspects him of murdering  Duncan. Hence, the secret of Duncan is not dead. It is captivating when  Macbeth confronts the witches they deceive him into thinking he is  invincible, and yet they have also shown him how he will be destroyed.  Also, when Macbeth realizes that Banquo's descendants will eventually  reign, his psychological frenzy shows us just how much he has degenerated.  This paves the way for the murder of Macduff's family. This in turn gives  Macduff a reason beyond politics to fight. Here Shakespeare masterfully  shows us that even Lady Macbeth has a conscience. Furthermore, he allows us  to feel Macbeth's regret over his crimes. We can even feel a sorry for him  when his beloved wife dies, when he fights bravely up until the very end,  and when he dies with dignity.	2000-03-04

The  reconciliation scene between Paul Dombey and his daughter is a scene of  such rare beauty even to an English major!

A knowledge of  &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1837) is vital for understanding Dickens. Not only was this his first novel, but it also shows  that Dickens had the ability to create comedy as well as tragic drama. If  we do not expose ourselves to Dickens' comical side, we are depriving  ourselves of a major aspect of Dickens. Also, the unquestionable friendship  between Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller is very touching. Between the comedy  and touching moments, this novel demonstrates that even as Dickens wrote  his first novel he was full of magnificent talent.	2000-03-04

This is a unique piece of literature in that we can see that life is not usually a battle between good and evil, but rather a battle between people with  different views. Cassius and Caesar both have traits that present them as  ambitious and dangerous. Yet, Shakespeare also leads us into having great  sympathy for both of them at times. Cassius honestly fears that Caesar will  be the terror of Rome. And yet, we can also understand that Caesar knows  that to be an effective ruler, he must maintain a strong autocratic hold.  Brutus is tricked into joining the conspiracy, but honestly feels that he  is serving Rome, and even when things get difficult he holds on to the  situation with both hands up until the very end. Mark Antony sees Caesar's  death as the start of chaos in Rome and he does his absolute best to crush  the conspiracy and restore order. It is interesting that rather than  gloating over his victory he offers his respect to his defeated foe. But  &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; also offers interesting psychological moments.  While Cassius and Brutus are very different people, they manage to stick  together through the consequences of their actions. Mark Antony shows  himself to be a master of psychology when in 3.2, he wins over the  multitude Brutus had won over moments earlier. (This is not an invention of  Shakespeare's. It really happened.) It is also an interesting psychological  aspect that Mark Antony first appears as little more than a servant to do  Caesar's bidding. Yet, when Caesar is killed, Mark Antony clearly shows  himself to be the most intelligent and able person in the play. He grabs  control with both hands and uses it in a  more effective manner than  anyone. We must not neglect the women in the play either. The appearance of  Caesar's wife is brief, but she clearly shows herself to be a loyal and  devoted wife. Furthermore, this helps us see the domestic aspect of  Caesar's tragedy. Also, the appearance of Brutus' wife helps us to see that  Brutus' concern over Rome's well being has struck him so much that his  domestic life has taken a back seat. Also, Shakespeare makes use of bad  omens like the soothsayer who warns Caesar (as well as all of us) of the  dangers to come. When the ghost of Caesar appears to haunt Brutus, it would  seem that Caesar becomes to Brutus, what the soothsayer was to him.  Finally, I can not overestimate the mastery of Shakespeare's writing when  the first 3 acts lead up to the brutal slaying of Caesar. And, just when we  think the worst has happened, Mark Antony delievers his soliloquy and makes  it clear that the game has only started. In addition to the play, I highly  suggest the old (1953) black and white movie where James Mason does Brutus  and Marlon Brando does Mark Antony.	2000-03-04

But I do not think this is accurate or fair. The reality is that many people can never find a middle ground. It is actually (in my opinion) quite common for people to only be able to see things from one  extreme or the other. Despite Apemantus' cynical nature, there is no  denying that whatever his faults are, HE DOES HAVE RIGHT ON HIS SIDE when  he tells Timon: &quot;The middle of humanity thou never knewest,/ but the  extremity of both ends....&quot; (4.3.342-343). Critics also tend to think  Apemantus is unlikable, but are we missing a crucial point? I can not help  but think Shakespeare is commenting on the fact that more people DON'T have  a concept of reality. Apemantus refuses to join in the delight when Timon  thinks highly of his false friends. Apemantus is aware of reality and no  one wants to hear it. In my opinion Timon and Apemantus are VERY TRUE to  life. In addition, the roll of Flavius is very touching. He can not dessert  his master even when he knows (or thinks) Timon has nothing. Finally, I can  not over estimate the mastery of Shakespeare when first Timon has money, he  can not do enough for his so called friends and when he has nothing they  dessert him. When Timon through fate gains a second fortune, he does not  turn back into what he was, but rather he uses his 2nd fortune to destroy  Athens. It is interesting that Shakespeare derived this play on the legend  of 'Timon the Manhater,' and decides to take it a step further and show how  he got there. And how much more realistic could Shakespeare have made this  than by first showing Timon as a 'manlover?' Many people feel Timon should  have somehow found the middle of humanity, but if he had, that would have  defeated the whole purpose of this excellent play.	2000-03-04

Why it is as popular as it is, I have no idea. Except for Iago, all of the characters are major simpletons. Furthermore, if Othello is suppose to be  so noble, why is he so ready to be duped into suspecting his wife of  infidelity with hardly any evidence. If he loves his wife, why is he  capable of killing her only days after they were married? I can not  understand why no one even suspected Iago of being untruthful. Finally, I  don't think this was Shakespeare's intention, but Iago comes off as a man  who had several valid reasons to be angry. He was turned down for promotion  in favor of Cassio (who from what we can gather from the play) is certainly  Iago's inferior. He had reason to suspect Othello was screwing around with  his wife, and he had reason to believe Cassio was messing around with his  wife. While some people believe Iago is simply telling more lies when he  speaks of this, we must remember, he reveals these things in soliloquies  where there is no point in telling lies.  Now if Othello was so enraged at  the possible infidelity of his wife, how does he explain his crime of  messing around with Iago's wife? Othello's end speech (and for that matter  his other so called noble speeches)  are infinitely unheroic and  unconvincing after he brutally murders his wife. If you want to read a play  that shows degeneration, stick with &quot;Macbeth.&quot; Or if you want to  see a magnificent villain, stick with &quot;Richard III.&quot;	2000-03-04
US	49979986	RXYNEZGLR6D57	0811468259	43217624	Hamlet	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Exquisite	My only complaint about this play is that Shakespeare kills the suspense of the actual play within the play that  'catches the conscience of the king,' with the inappropriate dumbshow. This play is a phenomenal  masterpiece. While some plays deal with 2D good and evil characters like  Albany and Goneril from &quot;King Lear,&quot; &quot;Hamlet&quot; offers us  a hero (Hamlet) with prevalent evil traits and a villain (Claudius) with  several good points. Aside from the deep psychological insights into human  nature it is  an interesting situation. To be sure, Hamlet wants to revenge  the murder of his father. But, Hamlet also  wants to kill Claudius and get  the crown too. Claudius wants to kill Hamlet and keep the crown too. But  because they are both loved by the public, direct action is impossible. It  is also interesting that Gertrude and Polonius are  not intelligent enough  to see the plainest point. Hamlet and Claudius on the other hand are both  so highly intelligent, that it is like they are playing political chess. I  also find it striking that Shakespeare at times presents the hero Hamlet  with evil traits such as the brutal killing of Polonius. On the other hand,  Claudius the villain shows himself to be a capable ruler, especially when  he quells Laertes' raid with pure courage and intelligence. Also, he does  not delight in what he had to do to get the crown. He clearly regrets it  and suffers for it.	2000-03-04

In all honesty &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854) is full of chilling passages and convincing characters  such as Thomas and Louisa Gradgrind. There is not one single dull moment.  Also, every chapter is full of striking images. In addition, the suspense  and dramatic irony are well placed. To be sure, many of Dickens' full  length books such as &quot;Dombey &amp; Son&quot; (1848) and &quot;Bleak  House&quot; (1853)are exquisite as well. But, don't let the thin length of  &quot;Hard Times&quot; fool you. It is a masterpiece and one I highly  recommend!	2000-03-03

Not only are the characters such as Henry VIII, Cranmer, and Wolsey convincing, but the poetry and images are beautiful. In addition, through the fall of several  characters such as Wolsey, we can see reflections of Shakespeare himself as  he wrote his 37th and final play. It is also poetically appropriate that  one of the greatest writers England ever knew ended his career by writing a  play about one of the greatest kings that England ever knew! I DO NOT  believe that Shakespeare only wrote parts of this play as many people do.  With the beautiful images, poetry, and captivating characters, I am very  confident in the belief that this play was written entirely by the one and  only William Shakespeare.	2000-02-28
