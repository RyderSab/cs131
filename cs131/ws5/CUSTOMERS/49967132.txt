The characters seem very twentieth-first century, not Gilded Age.  Brooke is much too much a \\"modern\\" woman.  The plot is certainly complex and could be enjoyable if you can stand the atmosphere.  If you like historical mysteries try Carola Dunn or Elizabeth Peters and skip this one.	2005-10-11

I do agree that there are a lot of typos and with two more books coming out before the new year it looks like she getting pushed, which would account for the typos. But I still loved the book and will buy the next one as soon as it released!  The humor in the book is undeniably good - and true.

It was just wonderful - plus with the added bonus of lots of helpful household hints.  The characters were vivid and went straight to your heart.  I am definitely rooting for Danny and Jo to get together though!  Danny is such a wonderful guy.  I also loved the dog, Chewie, and how he got his name (on Mindy's website) is just wonderful!  Completely worth the time to read!  I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out!	2005-08-01

But this was a wonderful, fun, as well as intriguing read.  It is much more similar to the books she writes with her husband as Robin Paige, than the other titles under her own name, but excellent nonetheless (and I like the Robin Paige mysteries). <br />	2005-07-07

I agree with the other reviewers that all our great characters weren't as important in this book and I missed them - especally Elvia and Emory!  I was hoping that Hud would find someone at the ranch...but no avail. I also figured out the ending way early, which I usually can't, which tells me the plot wasn't quite as good as normal.  I also really didn't like Johnny - kept hoping he was the bad guy! He was really annoying and immature.  But the book is worth the read if you've read the rest of the series.  <br />	2005-05-17

I was actually hoping that she'd be a recurring character, but it looks like she won't. But the characters and plot were fantastic as always! Definitely worth a read - and of course you need to go back and read all the ones before it!	2005-05-17

I love her recipes because they are always so down-to-earth good!  And it was great for Hannah's beaus to finally propose...but what an ending!!

I also thought that the plot was a little too far-fetched. Most of what Ms. Snelling writes is very true to homesteading (with the usual concessions to fiction), but this was one was harder to see happening that Augusta would get that lost and not end up dead or used. God does work in mysterious ways, so I can imagine it could have happened, just unlikely. But I was glad to see more of the characters in Blessing!	2003-04-08

I like Aunt Nettie and the chocolate store (makes me hungry though!).
