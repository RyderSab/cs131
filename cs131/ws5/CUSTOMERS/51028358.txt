US	51028358	R32LEFFN5X8Z03	0825671884	29726621	Jazz-Rock: A History	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A good overview.	It's a shame this book is out of print in the US (I found my copy brand-new in a hole-in-the-wall  music store in Berlin), because a study of this particular strain of jazz has been long overdue. Nicholson does a super job of framing the earliest beginnings of jazz-rock in the mid-1960s, when folks such as Jeremy Steig, The Flock and Charles Lloyd were making those links and also making some great music in the bargain. The in-depth chapters on Weather Report, John McLaughlin and Miles Davis (naturally!)come off particularly well ; Nicholson is not one to over-praise his subjects, but his reviews of their work, good and bad, are comprehensive and well-reasoned and he's great at getting their stories from as many sides as possible.<br />Having said that, I have some quibbles with the book. The distinction Nicholson makes between &quot;jazz-rock&quot; and &quot;fusion&quot; is at best highly debatable and I can't help but wonder if this explains the absence of even a bare mention of certain bands that, to my mind, qualify as playing &quot;jazz-rock&quot; (the most glaring omissions include a lot of UK bands, specifically Brand X, Bill Bruford's Earthworks and Phil Manzanera's Quiet Sun). Like a lot of critics, he can be high-handed in his judgements of certain artists and groups; I particularly disagree with his assessments of Jamaladeen Tacuma and Mike Stern's albums as bandleaders, most of which I think deserved better examinations. But by and large Nicholson suceeds at detailing a particular period within the history of jazz and makes a compelling study that shows that what emerged from the &quot;jazz-rock&quot; period was a lot of music that still thrills!	2004-04-04

Considering the lengths Laura Nyro went to to keep her private life out of the public eye, it's amazing that we have this book at all, let alone that it's as well put-together as it is. Michele Kort does a first-rate job in showing the evolution of Nyro, her music and her outlook on life, which was always key to how her muse took hold. What you end up with is a portrait of a woman steadfastly true to herself, no matter the cost to her career. I'm left with admiration for her, admittedly tempered by a feeling that not every choice she made was a good one. No matter; this is a well-drawn biography of an interesting and uniquely talented person who made some unforgettable music.	2004-03-28

Several years ago, Harlan Ellison was vital, Harlan Ellison was angry, Harlan Ellison was a force of chaos that upset the applecart any chance he got. Time hasn't been kind either to him or to the stories collected herein. He's become the unapologetic, misanthropic crank who stands in the middle of the square railing at all the fools around him and ultimately is tiresome to read or listen to.

It turns out that writing books about The Grateful Dead is a lot like writing books about the Beatles; highly speculative, frequently pointless and ultimately frustrating, unless you're somebody like Ken Kesey or Ed McClanahan, writers who were there with the Dead from the start and speak the language. That said, Blair Jackson gets as close as anyone totally caught in the Dead's warp can to writing a definitive book on Garcia. Jackson's Deadhead banter sometimes gets in the way of, you know, communicating about why the rest of us should consider Jerry Garcia one of the greats. Mind you, I think he is, but the proof is ultimately in listening to one of the Dead's many live albums (and some of the studio ones as well) or Garcia's other records and HEARING why, not reading much of what's here. What IS worth the time is the extensive discography Jackson has at the end, which is a reliable signpost for what a non-Deadhead fan or a Dead newbie might find worth the time and money. <br />In sum, a good book for Deadheads or Dead admirers, not so great if you don't know what the fuss is/was about...but want to.	2004-01-22

For the life of me, I don't understand the attitudes of some of the folks posting their reviews of this book! What were some of you people expecting? A ghost-written autobiography gushing about how, &quot;it was the fans, after all, who made me what I am today?&quot; The man lost two of the people most dear to him within months of each other and was going on this journey for whatever healing potential it had for him, and you're whining because maybe he doesn't have his music or his adoring fans in the forefront of his mind right now? Grow up!!<br />I like Rush, although I have to admit that I've ALWAYS been put off by Peart's sanctimonious nature (mostly apparent in his interviews, where if the man has a sense of humor, he keeps it invisible). What drew me to the book, and what kept me reading it to the end, were the circumstances Peart found himself in and how he dealt with it. Fact is, we all heal from tragedies in different ways---this was his way. Parts of his &quot;healing road&quot; were interesting, parts of it were not, parts of it were very moving indeed. And if I ever had to face the magnitude of tragedy Neil Peart contended with, I hope I could find the reserves of inner power he found to cope with it.<br />I'd also like to point out that if Neil Peart really had contempt for his public, he probably wouldn't have released this book. I'd like to think--rightly or wrongly--that he put it out partly to continue his own healing, and partly with the intention that those who read it would find something they could draw from when they themselves cope with life's harsher realities. I dare anybody to find that contemptuous.	2002-12-25

I loved reading this book, both from the standpoint of appreciating Paul Mazursky the director of many of my favorite films and reveling in Paul Mazursky the no-holds-barred storyteller. But--and, I'm sorry, there is a 'but'---why devote one sentence to the great Art Carney, who Mazursky calls the most pure actor he'd ever worked with, and then not tell the reader WHY he feels that way about Carney? There are no anecdotes to share about Jill Clayburgh or Robin Williams? Come on, Paul, give! This lapse is mostly compensated for by Mazursky's tales of traveling in the &quot;then&quot; Soviet Union and South America, his memories of working for Danny Kaye and his sharing the bitter and the sweet about his family, his friends and the ups and downs of his life. The chapter about Mazursky's relationship with his mother is especially powerful and a reminder that much of the pathos within even his funniest films came honestly to him. So, five stars for what's here---just would've liked to have seen more!	2002-09-20

Since the musicians covered in this book certainly were part of my growing years in the Seventies, I was greatly interested in how this book would pan out. It's really quite refreshing; instead of a lot of scholarly blather about influences, parallels in Aoelean cadences in classical composition, blah-blah-blah, Muise just interviewed the subjects and/or those around them and constructs their stories from there. <br />What you get are pretty clear pictures of the lives of four great musicians who weren't the chart-sellers of their day but were (and are) hard-working, sometimes hard-living guys who followed their calling. The honesty of many of the interviewees is equally refreshing: Robin Trower's manager isn't at all afraid of calling one of his client's albums \\"a piece of ...\\" in print (and he's STILL Trower's manager, so there you are!), and while some of the interviews conflict with each other in certain details about who did what, that's very human, and nice to see in unglossed form.<br />The best thing about this book is that not only have I gone back to listen to my Robin Trower and Rory Gallagher music collections with renewed appreciation, but I've pulled out that old vinyl copy of Humble Pie's ROCK ON that I haven't played in almost thirty years and recaptured just a little of the feeling of adrenalin I had when I first slapped it on the turntable. And it's made me want to take another look at Rick Derringer, who I pretty much ignored during the Seventies. This is a job well done!	2002-07-21

Both writings are concerned with the hard, dark underbelly of the suburban American Dream. But I definetely had a different reaction to Flook's story than other reviewers here. I don't find her self-pitying at all, but rather in that place where the only way to call the devil by name (which, by the way, is \\"dysfunctional family\\") is to just tell the story. And, no, to respond to one reviewer's rhetorical question, I don't think Flook's mother comes off as the sanest person in this sad narrative. Nobody seems to be anything but self-centered, even Flook's sweet but ineffectual father, who seemingly gets his gratification by pretending that his family isn't falling apart around him. Flook uses the metaphor of two ocean liners ramming into each other to describe the calamities within her family. She simply tells it like it was, without reproach, justification or regret. It wasn't every child's family or upbringing--it was hers, and she survived it, didn't she?	2002-07-18

Well, no caution is needed. This is a powerful, grim tale centered around a midwife who loves bringing babies into the world and is good at it..and the birth incident that devestates her, her family and her calling. Bohjalian is one of the few male writers I've read who creates three-dimensional women chracters---Sybil Danforth, the midwife in question, is a thoughtful, confident caregiver and person who stays believable to the reader throughout. This actually is true of all of the populace of this book. Unlike TRANS-SISTER RADIO, things are far from neatly wrapped-up by the time you reach the end, and you leave the book with a sense that the story still isn't quite over.<br />This is no &quot;light read;&quot; you'll be up in the wee small hours reading 'til the end....and you'll be left with many questions. A terrific book.	2002-04-26

Chris Bojalian has an engaging, provocative premise here: what happens to a romantic relationship between two people of the opposite sex when one-half of the couple undergoes a sex-change? What does that make the relationship in the eyes of the other half---and in the eyes of the people around them? For the most part, Bojalian makes the dilemmas and conflicting emotions each of his characters experience come alive and resonate. Unfortunately, in the last fifty or so pages, he succumbs to the urge to wrap it up neatly with a \\"happily ever after\\" ending that feels completely false given what's come before. This error in judgement left a sour taste in my mouth when I finished the book, and it derails what up to then had been a very powerful view of gender issues and \\"couple-ness.\\" What a shame.	2002-04-19

Ben Fong-Torres' biography about Parsons only reinforces this wariness; he had talent, sure, but he was also a grandmaster at screwing up the good things in his life. He had an enormous ego and an appetite for chemical recreation that seems upon reading to have been limitless. Who knows what could've happened if he'd partied a little less and moved music to the forefront of his life a little more? Fong-Torres may hold Parsons in high regard, but this doesn't prevent him from showing his subject's less admirable sides. <br />It also doesn't prevent him from showing that when Parsons really worked at it, what resulted was some of the best music that still resonates today. \\"Brass Buttons,\\" \\"She\\" and the song that gives the title for this biography are today considered to be country ballad standards of the first stripe by many, and they deserve that honor.  And if he wasn't necessarily the \\"father\\" of \\"country rock,\\" Parsons certainly was one of the first to show that country with a rock attitude made for some great music. All you have to do is listen to his posthumous \\"Grievious Angel\\" collection for proof of that. <br />Fong-Torres spends less time on Parson's music than on his personal travails, but that's probably because the latter managed to undermine the former more often than not. That said, HICKORY WIND effectively displays the life of a guy who could've been a contender and, as it is, remains a lasting presence in the world of music.	2002-03-18

He's spent much of his life in perpetual outrage over what he sees as gross injustices in the world and, as one acquaintance puts it in this book, he'd even find Mahatma Gandhi's virtue wanting. Mendelson Joe is a severe critic of humanity; he's also a steadfastly honest man who speaks his mind and lives his life as close to &quot;walking the walk while talking the talk&quot; as he can. As editor and co-writer of this book, Nadia Halim manages to present Joe, his friends and his detractors in as fair and forthright a light as possible. Those who don't live in Canada are probably largely unfamiliar with Mendelson Joe, so suffice it to say that he'll confound your expectations and may tick you off initially. He also just might win you over to his way of thinking.	2001-09-24

The difference between &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; and &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot; is the difference between a long, fantastic novel that pulls you in and keeps you intoxicated throughout (MC) and a long, fantastic novel that doesn't know when to stop and wears you out long before it's finished (TGBHF). Since Rushdie uses some of the world of the former to populate and illustrate the latter, it's not an inappropriate comparison. The deft storytelling talents of Rushdie are still to be seen within the hackneyed plot, though, and that's what kept me reading t'il the end. But even then it's hard to give much of a rip about either Ormus Cama or Vina Apsara. This isn't 1972 and the notion of rock stars as tormented demigods went out with Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars. Say it's an entertaining read in spite of itself and go get &quot;Haroun&quot; or &quot;Shame&quot; for more potent examples of Rushdies considerable writing talents.<br />Oh, yeah, it's way, way, way, way, WAY too long!	2001-07-21

There may be differences between the Democratic and Republican &quot;visions,&quot; but one thing both parties see clearly enough is $$$$ galor, soft, hard and in the shades of grey between. This, plus the eroding of even a modicum of civility and decorum in the House and Senate (I worked on Capitol Hill during the Seventies and, yes, both chambers USED to be civilized; thanks for nothing, Newt!) and the other ways in which our governing branches have fallen apart, are examined by Elizabeth Drew in detail and with a great deal of (warranted) dismay and disgust. And contrary to the folks here who've complained of Drew's so-called liberal bias, damned few current senators or representatives of any political stripe come out of this book without smelling. Senator Fred Thompson is one of the few who does emerge unscathed, hardly a &quot;fiery liberal spirit,&quot; to paraphrase Tom Lehrer. This book may or may not be revelatory overall, but, more likely, it'll confirm what you've suspected all along---the system'll stay broke so long as money and special interests call the tune. Slick Willie's latest post-presidency revelations certainly indicate that this much is true and Mitch McConnell's only allegiance has been to the almighty dollar, anyway, so....but enough. A good, provocative book that should boil your blood.	2001-02-21

Fine. So you can't really complain that Donald Trump doesn't belong here--sure he does, he was born in 1946--but in the end his chronicles tell you less about the Sixties and more about himself, more than he'd probably care to admit. Several of the other life stories are much more interesting than Trump's, but in the end they also don't tell me much more than I'd already ascertained; that when people grow, they change. Some here haven't change much except idealogies; conservative Barbara Ledeen apparently still sees heinous conspiracies in everything, only they're left-wing conspiracies now instead of the right-wing ones of her former Marxist incarnation. Others, such as Doug Martlette, Marianne Williamson and David McIntosh, did major overhauls in their outlook and POV. But none of these chronicles really tells me anything about what made the Sixties more influencial than, say, the Fifties or the Eighties. This makes Michael Gross' book a qualified sucess as a cultural history of America, but a very engrossing collection of people's lives---the good, bad, ugly and lovely.	2001-02-19

Brinkley does a tremendous job both at detailing what Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have done in the last 15+ years and at getting to the core of what motivates their actions and their lives. Brinkley's examination of the Carter's strong Christian beliefs is a good reminder that there is a moral Christian majority in America that doesn't need the divisive tactics of Jerry Falwell or Phyllis Schlafley and simply opts for practicing what they preach, so to speak. Love him or hate him, Jimmy Carter has always been true to his visions of a better America. To see him put those visions to work instead of fading into the sunset is inspiring, and this book goes a long way in showing how he and Rosalynn Carter did it.	2001-01-14

It's good that  he wants to make his book as accessable to the general public as possible,  but too often it leads him to sentences which are unintentionally  deprecating and, well, trite. An example: &quot;The unimpugned lootings of  Jewish-owned property and businesses had already begun, and the move to  examine everybody's family tree for signs of Jewish blood became the deadly  Trivial Pursuit of the time.&quot; I don't think it's being oversensitive  to be offended by having Hitler's despicable racial policies compared to a  popular board game from the 1980s, but quite apart from that, sentences  like this one put things in simplistic ways more appropriate for a high  school term paper than for a scholarly work.<br />Nonetheless, Shirakawa has  done a scrupulous job of examining Furtwangler's life and career. The  evidence he puts forward that Furtwangler was not a Nazi is well-documented  and compelling, even if there are remaining doubts (which there probably  always will be). He also does a very credible job at detailing the  conductor's work habits, his thoughts on his craft, his dalliances (which  were considerable), his relations with other composers, conducters and  musicians, and his frequent battles of wills with the leaders of the Third  Reich. You may still feel no pity for Furtwangler's dilemmas at the end of  the book, but it's not because the author hasn't been thorough in examining  his subject's life. I hope Shirakawa might consider a revision this book at  some later date; there's too much that's good about this book to let it be  undermined by what's bad.	2000-08-19

He captures Bangs in all his high and low moments with an eye for detail and with great  empathy, but without blinders on. Derogatis also manages to get all the,  ahem, nuances of rock in the Seventies, certainly the rock of the Seventies  that Bangs was most interested in. Whatever quibbles I have with the book  are personal biases about how vital or not punk, New York, Lou Reed, etc.  really were to rock as a totality, but LET IT BLURT still works grandly as  a well-honed portrait of a life. Nice job.	2000-07-26

It's fine to show the weak points of all of your characters---Swede Levov's delusional  notions of a crises-free life, his wife Dawn's love-hate relationship with  her beauty pageant days, Jerry Levov's jealous vitrol, etc. etc.---but if  everyone's flaws and warped dreams are the only thing that distinguish  them, how are you suppose to empathise with any of them? Because we all  carry these traits? Because we all have grand visions that get dashed?  That's a hell of a note on life.<br />I don't necessarily read fiction to be  &quot;uplifted,&quot; but I have real problems with books where the basic  theme is &quot;life is a cesspool disguised as a flower bed and when we  discover that, it's too late to do anything about it and we're doomed to  end life in misery.&quot; For all of the excellent writing in this book and  despite the fact that the story does move you along, in the end I felt  walluped over the head by the misery...not enlightened or thoughtful or,  yes, empathetic for the Levovs and their world. Feel free to disagree.	2000-07-01

There's evidence of that in all of his books for adults  and no less so in BARNEY'S VERSION. Barney Panofsky is no great saint, much  like his sometime cohort Duddy Kravitz (who puts in an appearance here).  Many of the misfortunes that befall Barney have been self-inflicted and he  knows it, but the one big question--did he or didn't he murder his best  friend--may be a frame set against him. As he deals with that dilemma, we  get Barney's (and Richler's) caustic skewerings of the pompous, the venal  and the ludicrous in today's world. The book is uproariously funny if  politically incorrect most of the time, but the way it ends will jolt you  back to Earth in short order. A modern classic.	2000-06-15

There's nothing in this book that will make either  Eagle fans or Eagle foes change their minds about the band's musical  legacy. As a story of how pride goeth before a (protracted) fall, though,  this book works great. You don't have to be a rabid detractor of the Eagles  to be put off by the antics of these guys, who basically would've been  consigned to evolving into fiftysomething fratboys if fate hadn't  intervened. Does that make them any worse than Frank, Dino and the other  members of the Vegas &quot;Rat Pack&quot; of the Sixties? Probably not. For  that matter, the life and times of the Eagles end up, as Eliot tells it,  being not much different than the life and times of the Velvet Underground  or the life and times of the Beach Boys or the life and times of (FILL IN  BAND NAME HERE.). But you have to wonder after awhile whether any of them  will ever grow up.	2000-05-27

Christgau is the master of the zinger; when he skewers a release or an artist, they're pinned to the wall. You may go bonkers with this book if your musical tastes and Christgau's don't match, because his sarcasm is  withering and he has taken the trouble to listen to everything he reviews  numerous times before praising or panning, so it's not uninformed  criticism. When he praises something, buy it, he's on target most of the  time. When he pans, wellllll.........<br />But Christgau, to his credit, is  upfront with his biases and will sometimes transcend those biases and give  kudos, however reluctantly, to music put out by artists who he can't stand  if he thinks it passes muster. That's ultimately what makes him a good  resource; he loves popular music, if not every part of it, and he knows  whereof he speaks.	2000-03-26

Martin's book is an great attempt to come to terms with a branch of music  that may have it's pretentions but can also be exciting and involving...and  often is. I don't buy all of his efforts to analyze this music in Marxist  terms, but that's the charm. He sets you thinking about the subject,  whether you agree or disagree with him,  and that's what a good critic  should do. What's more, if you like this sort of music, you come away fromn  this book with a few more names of performers to search for.<br />As to what's  &quot;Progressive&quot; and what's not; hey, for my money, the only thing  that was progressive about Frank Zappa was that he knew how to write things  in funny time signatures---other than that, he was one of the most  reactionary, sexist musicians to have ever graced a stage.	2000-02-23

George Martin, Sam Phillips and  Quincy Jones you probably know, but the insights of others like Bob Rock  (Metallica), Norman Smith (Pink Floyd), Bill Price (The Sex Pistols), Roy  Halee (Paul Simon), Chris Kimsey (The Rolling Stones) and Leiber and  Stoller (Elvis, The Drifters), as well as everyone else featured here, make  for fascinating reading about what goes on in the studio.

But there are a lot of musicians and albums here that  warrant the attention Ritchie Unterberger lavishes on them, and the best  part is that so much of what's discussed here is readily available on CDs.  The histories themselves are terrific; the chapters on Swamp Dogg and Lee  Hazlewood are worth the entire price of the book. Definetely worthwhile  reading and I hope there's a Part II in the future.

So many books about rock 'n roll are letdowns because they speak in generalities about the music without informing the reader of the circumstances that shaped it. SUMMER OF LOVE is an exception; it's a  well-written, engaging chronicle of the music and the players in the Bay  area from 1965 to 1971. Selvin lets history speak for itself, so you get  the glorious and the ghastly with no punches pulled. The impression one is  left with is that, whether you think the Haight-Ashbury thing was  wonderful, tragic or a load of P.R. hype, it certainly was like no other  scene and it left a lot of fine music in it's wake. A good one.	2000-01-11

Morris is able, without irony or gimmickry, to sweep the reader into the tales of her  protagonists. What most of these stories deal with are the subtle  transformations that occur in people as events and time impact them. She  doesn't spell out the way her tales resolve themselves because she doesn't  have to; her characters own actions (or,  in some cases, inactions) make  the conclusions very apparent to the reader even when nothing is bluntly  stated. Mary Morris is a fine teller of stories and this collection is  worth reading cover to cover.	1999-12-25

It's also very apparent by the last chapter that his appreciation and love hasn't prevented Ritz from  seeing Gaye's life from all sides. He explores his subject's strengths and  failings with a deft hand; details that could have been tawdry and  sensationalistic in a lesser writer becomes revelatory when Ritz deals with  them. <br />Everybody discussed in this book emerges with three dimensions.  Marvin Gay, Sr., who was his son's killer, certainly did a monsterous,  horrible thing, but Ritz goes to great lengths to try and understand both  father and son and their hateful relationship, in order to make some sense  out of the day Marvin, Jr. died. Similarly, Berry and Anna Gordy, Marvin's  former boss and former wife, are neither roundly vilified or let off the  hook; Ritz takes pains, for instance, to show that however much Berry Gordy  may have stifled Marvin's growth as an artist (he hated WHAT'S GOING ON,  rightly considered by many as the finest album Marvin Gaye ever recorded),  he also gave Marvin his freedom on a number of other projects and always  respected his talent. <br />And Ritz doesn't whitewash his subject, either; it  becomes clear that Marvin Gaye could be very warm and very hostile, equally  surefooted and wreckless in his career. By the end of his life, Gaye had  succumbed to the madness of his own demons and maybe, just maybe, there was  no other way things could've turned out. If you've ever been buoyed by the  jubilation of &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot; or moved by the passion of  &quot;What's Going On,&quot; you'd do well to read this excellent  biography.	1999-11-05

Elvis, Chuck Berry, the Beatles, The  Stones, The Velvets, Springsteen, Punk and (God help us) U2 all make the  grade. As for anything else; You can have The Doors only with the caveat  that they weren't really very good. Can't have Yes or Jethro Tull, they're  too &quot;Pretentious.&quot;  And Black Sabbath? Steely Dan? Crosby, Stills  and Nash? Hey, folks, whether you want to admit it or not, THEY and a ton  of other &quot;musical pariahs&quot; were much more a part of rock n'roll's  POPULAR history than any critic's darlings ever were and omitting them  calls into question how &quot;sweeping&quot; a so-called social history of  rock really could be.

The first is, unfortunately, The Band aren't in vogue anymore, so why reprint the book and use paper that's earmarked for a Britney Spears  quickie bio, right? Another reason, though, is that Barney Hoskyns is only  passable at writing a biography, however much he may love his subject.  There's a lot of details he simply gets wrong (No, Mr. Hoskyns, Lily Tomlin  and Albert Brooks are NOT from Canada; Tomlin was born in Detroit and  Brooks in California) and there's a lot of his critical opinions which  render his judgement suspect (his critiques of Jesse Winchester and John  Hammond, Jr. are laughable). But, as said, Hoskyns does love The Band and  when he sticks to telling their story, their musical legacy gains  dimension. You come away from the book wishing that so many things could've  been different for them all, but grateful that they've also given us a lot  of great music. So I hope it gets reprinted, but with considerable  revisions.	1999-09-24

From the information Marc Eliot  gives forth in this very well-written, powerful book, Phil Ochs was a man  whose fantasies were so intergrated with his realities that when reality  won out, he had nowhere else to go. There's not much more to say---you can  &quot;what if&quot; the poor man's choices 'til kingdom come and, in the  end, what's left is a very talented guy whose life lacked enough that he  chose to end it.

You just have to switch on your radio now and hear songs that were once anthems being used to hawk jeans,  beer, bank cards, etc. and if that doesn't make you even a little  indignant, you're either too young to remember or too embalmed to give a  damn. Fred Goodman's book is a good accounting of some of the other nails  in rock's coffin, the forces of the entertainment business who saw gold in  them thar hills. Yeah, I know, I know---how foolish, how naive to think  that rock could be anything BUT a commodity, as with any other form of  popular entertainment. Perhaps so, but naivete is what started rock off in  the first place, the idea that boundaries were made to be broken and that  not all rebels join the herd in the end. I'm still playing my Dylan albums,  though, and if the lustre has worn off the man's image somewhat as time has  gone by, it doesn't change the fact that Dylan---and Neil Young and Bruce  Springsteen and Joni Mitchell and even Glenn Frey and Don Henley---still  made a large body of music that mattered then and matters now. But the old  image of rock as &quot;music of the people&quot; or whatever, that's gone  the way of all flesh.	1999-09-05

Comics-style horror moves, no heavy-handed dialogue, none of the things that, for me, usually make him a one-time read and that's it.  This story has a lead character who has three dimensions (four, if you  count his psychic abilities)and tells about a good man with an obligation  thrust upon him that he can't really run from. Johnny Smith and the people  in his life are people we all know in one way or another, and when all is  said and done THE DEAD ZONE transcends it's supernatural trappings and lets  the story and the characters shine through. King has only sporadically  achieved that balance in his subsequent novels, but he shows here that when  he doesn't stoop to the cheap scare, he can write a powerful horror novel  that stands up over time.	1999-07-19

If you were American and into rock during the late Sixties and early Seventies, chances are that the only thing you knew about the Guess Who were their hits on AM radio. John Einarson's biography gives you much more  information about one of Canada's best bands. I remember buying their album  ROAD FOOD when it first came out---once you got past the &quot;hits&quot;  that were on it (in this case, &quot;Clap For The Wolfman&quot; and  &quot;Star Baby&quot;), you discovered other equally great songs that  should've been more widely known. That was the case with so many Guess Who  albums. Einarson does a great job outlining the band's history and putting  it in the context of the Canadian rock scene of the time, one that a lot of  Americans probably weren't aware of. If you know the group, you may not  agree with all of his assessments (I don't), but good for him for reminding  the world of a terrific band.	1999-07-18
