The characters are cardboard (or styrofoam) and the plot just too outlandish. Honestly, it reads like it was written by a ninth-grader with a great imagination but little knowledge of the writing craft. I can't believe this book was a bestseller or that so many people recommended this author to me. I'm certainly not tempted to try any of his other works.	2005-09-25

For the first third of the book I kept wondering why Elvis didn't just have a DNA test to determine whether the murder victim was his father. By the end of the book I fully understood. Hey, if it had been someone claiming to be my father what would I really learn from a DNA test: yes or no, that's all. Elvis went on a voyage of discovery, never believing but always half-hoping. Also - but just for a minute - I thought there was not enough of Joe Pike in this book but in fact Joe's presence may have been minimal but was made all the more meaningful by it. If Joe and Elvis both have issues with their fathers they really have come to the best possible resolution by finding a father in each other. No father could have been more determined to protect and save his child or more steadfast in his regard for a much-admired father than Joe was in re Elvis. And Joe made no secret in an earlier book that he had always looked to Elvis for wisdom. Yeah, the Elvis of Disney figurines and Pinocchio clock and ever-ready wisecrack. The three most recent Elvis Cole books really all tie together in a trilogy about fatherhood and childhood and what every boy wants or needs to see in his father - and what damage can be done by both the presence and absence of a father. I know some folks think 'LA Requiem' is the best Crais book of all, and I won't deny it's a gem. But I don't rate it one bit better than 'Last Detective' or 'Forgotten Man.' I almost pity those people who discovered Elvis Cole long before now because they had long waits between the books, where I was lucky enough to read them in order this week, one right after the other, so that the linkage of the stories and the emotions evoked by the perfectly understated bonds of friendship were almost overwhelming. And, hey! The plot is pretty darned good, too! Maybe Elvis isn't making as many wisecracks as he did in the early books but I like him just fine all the same. And as for Joe Pike... Well... I could eat him with a spoon. 'Nuff said!	2005-07-14

It's a good story and moves along swiftly -- maybe too swiftly, because the characterizations could use a generous helping hand, not to mention that the corrupt, good ol' boy Southern law enforcement aspect could have used a little more atmosphere or ambiance (I mean, the descriptions of Jackson and Mobile are just sad; they could be anywhere USA [or maybe that was the point?]). But if you're a Grisham fan (I'm not) this book should be at the top of your reading list. If your taste runs more to Robert Crais or Michael Connelly you might want to skip this one. However I will check out this author's next book because (1) this was a very solid first effort and (2) the way Billy Ray finally (and legally) stuck it to the Chief of Police put me forcibly in mind of my favorite of Erle Stanley Gardner's creations, Donald Lam. Lam was a brilliant detective & lawyer (albeit disbarred) and when his rights were trampled could institute some serious legal retaliation, just like Billy Ray. I recommend this book with caution but look forward to better from this author.	2005-07-11

I'm new to the Jack Reacher series but I have to say that I enjoyed this first book. I was interested in reading what other reviewers had to say: Author was charged with using the word \\"shrugged\\" too much. I never noticed, I was busy turning the pages I guess. Author was charged with using short, choppy sentences. Is that a literary offense? Because if it is, it's time to take Hemingway's work out and burn it, he having been critically lauded for years for that short, choppy style which is supposed to be very manly -- in a literary sense, I suppose. All I know is that I find old Hem's work mindnumbingly dull. At least Mr. Child keeps me awake, those choppy sentences lend a sense of urgency to the story. (Just like Earl Emerson's short chapters in 'Pyro'!) Author is charged with not being an expert on America. Neither am I and I've spent 48 out of 50 years here. Oh, and one review bemoaned the fact that somehow the author failed to realize the US has no Marines stationed in Europe, that we have no naval base there. Hm, I don't keep up with the exact locations of all US bases but I spent two years at Zaragoza Air Base, Spain, and when I was there, the US had a naval base at Rota. Author is charged with having a written a very violent book. Well. There you have me. It IS violent. If violence disturbs you, what the heck are you doing reading books in this genre in the first place? There was a great honking picture of a bloody handprint on the cover of the paperback I bought -- I would have thought that was a (you'll excuse the pun) dead giveaway as to the nature of this book. Oh, almost forgot. The author is also charged with too much coincidence in the brother/killing plot point. Stranger things happen every day -- gee, Bush got elected twice. I think THAT's stretching coincidence! <br /> <br />Yes, Jack Reacher is an anti-hero. Yes, the books has some flaws (as most every book I've ever read does). But I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to seeing Reacher's character progression in the next book. Do I think he's the next Lucas Davenport? Nope, not unless he gets a stronger sense of humor and a lot more sexy. But Reacher is verrrry interesting! <br /> <br />OK, I'm done defending the book. Now, here's the bit that bothered me: A top gun in the Treasury Dept drops out of sight and the Feds don't swarm all over looking for him when his prints come across the computer? A second Treasury Dept worker is brutally murdered in an airport and (1) it's the busy airport at Atlanta and no one sees it??? and (2) the Feds don't follow up on this either?  Still -- I was able to suspend my disbelief long enough to overlook these things, just because I wanted to see what Jack would do next.	2005-06-23

Beware the Curves is the one title in which Donald gets to put his legal education to use inside a courtroom, albeit he masterminds the defense from behind the rail. If you're not familiar with the partnership of Cool & Lam, are you in for a treat! Bertha is 160 pounds of hard-as-diamonds personality; she squashes euphemisms like they were roaches. Abrasive, greedy, and overbearing, she's also intensely loyal. Her junior partner is Donald Lam, a disbarred lawyer who is always at least three steps ahead of the reader and is forever leading with his chin. With his brains, good looks and sex appeal you might think Lam is too good to be true but a reading of several of these titles will show that Donald has his flaws: He can be careless of people's feelings and he can be more than a little vindictive; he never forgets a slight and he always makes the offender pay for it, even if the offender is his partner. I enjoy the Perry Mason books but I re-read the Cool & Lam books every couple of years. Even though I know how the case will come out I enjoy the character interaction between undersized Donald Lam and the seamy characters of Los Angeles.	2005-06-15

His writing is economical, unflinching, and with each new book he finds ways to challenge his own talent. In the past he's given us street-smart heroes, womanizers, heroes troubled by their pasts, but this time he gives us a genuine nice guy in Jason Gum, a guy with a normal amount of talent, brains and ambition, but one with a fatal flaw: Timidity. One moment, one tiny moment, one small and what should be inconsequential decision to try to avoid \\"getting in trouble\\" and his world begins to spiral out of control. Gum makes that decision over and over again, as \\"getting in trouble\\" assumes larger and more life-threatening proportions with each error in judgment until he finds himself so tightly painted into a corner that all the turpentine in the world would not give him a way out. In this book, as in his more recent outings, Emerson takes us on a journey of self-discovery along with Gum, where we can empathize with his mistakes, knowing it would be all too easy to fall into the same traps as Gum given the same pressures and temptations he faced. And with all of this, the book is laden with action and vivid imagery. Hollywood surely ought to make a film of this book.	2005-06-01

That may be carrying the \\"procedural\\" aspect of police procedurals too far. Realistic it may be, but I read for entertainment as well and I felt that a sizable portion of this book was singularly dull. 150+ pages of reading about Bosch reading reports? Hmm... The mystery itself is probably one of this author's better ones, but it simply takes far too long for the reader to empathize. Even when the story began to pick up speed it pretty much stayed in the Betty Blue Hair lane of traffic. The easy pacing of (most of the) prior Bosch tales was always tinged with mood and atmosphere, altogether missing here. While reading this one I could almost feel the author reaching for the words and picking the ones that were almost-but-not-quite. And the saddest thing for me to say about a Connelly book, is that this time he slipped over the edge of \\"poetic\\" and fell deep into \\"purple\\" prose more than once. I literally groaned when I read the paragraph about 'church of the blue religion'. Doesn't he have an editor anymore, or like Stephen King, does his publisher see no point in spending money on one since this author's books now are all best-sellers before they hit the stands?	2005-05-21

And that's saying something for a series that has been around as long as the Prey books have. EveryTIME I thought I knew where this story was going, Sandford messed with my mind and jacked up my logical processes. When I think of how bored or impatient or downright irritated I become with other authors' series after only 3-4 books, I am amazed that in this 17th book of the series Sandford not only continues to deliver the goods, oh baby, he -- BAM! -- kicks it up another notch! A notch? Oh, heck, he put this thang waaaaay on into overdrive. (Is it too late for a mixed metaphor alert?) I'm not even gonna blast off over the typos (John, John, you gotta get some help proofing those galleys). This book is a supersolid altogether 5 star effort. And then some. And then some more!     So ... why did I only give it 4 stars?     Dear Author: No way, NO WAY you can put a Billy Joel song (Piano Man??? Ack-ack!

This is my 3rd McDermid novel, I previously read 'Mermaids Singing' and 'Wire in the Blood.' McDermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel I see dangerous repetitions in character types which, if repeated in the next Tony Hill/Carol Jordan book will make that one my last purchase. Generally McDermid paints female police officers as brighter, more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts, as well as more often homosexual. The men, with the exception of leading man Tony Hill, are mostly all egotistical, back-stabbing, power-hungry morons of the lowest order, while Hill is rendered impotent -- a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber. The slow mating dance between Hill and Jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff. And in this book, the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as Dr. Hill. The emotional connection between Hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here, making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought. And the real villain -- not the serial killer but a drug-pushing / illegal-immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer. The climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger. I was extremely disappointed with this book.	2005-03-30

O'Donnell does a nifty job of combining action/adventure with humor and drama. This title is my sentimental favorite probably because this is the one in which the recurring character of sharp-witted, self-professed coward Stephen Collier is introduced. Collier is the Everyman we can identify with, who allows us as readers to partake of the action and observe Modesty and sidekick Willie Garvin's antics without pretending in any way to be their peer. Like Collier the reader is a passenger on this wild caper - you may hold your breath at times and burst out laughing at others. This book has all the hallmarks of a Blaise/Garvin outing: Ingenious villains, a Garvin girl story, wit, wonderfully detailed combat sequences -- if you've never read a Modesty Blaise book, no need to begin at the beginning because this book easily stands on its own and is thrilling enough to induce you to read the others.	2005-01-01

The entire \\"Full\\" series Evanovich co-wrote was pathetic in both concept and execution (I say 'entire' but I only read the first 3 in that series. Nothing could persuade me to send any more hard-earned dollars down that particular rat-hole.). That's strike one for this author. Numbers 9 and 10 in the Stephanie Plum series have convinced me to spend no more money on her either. Strike two. And now, to revive what even the author must see is flagging enthusiasm for her efforts, she gives us 'Metro Girl.' And NASCAR Guy. The latter she gives us ad infinitum and the former, well, I'm not too sure what was \\"metro\\" about her. To give the author some credit she did make more of an effort to instill a storyline than in the most recent Plum book but it simply wasn't enough to save this book which follows the Plum Success Formula too closely to avoid the inevitable (and disparaging) comparisons. And that's strike three. I've given Evanovich too much of my time and money already to continue wasting it on the unoriginal and uninteresting works she's been foisting off on eager readers lately. I'm not buying any more of her books and I can't think I'll even be interested enough to seek them out at the library.	2004-12-07

Not only was the mystery good, but a female sleuth who did not irritate me (as so many other feminine sleuths do, e.g. Kinsey Milhone, Stephanie Plum, Kay Scarpetta, and yes, Miss Marple, too). I'm no geologist but unlike the PW reviewer I have no quarrel with the jargon in this book, nor do I need it all explained to me. I grasped more than enough to lend color to the story, but was not so overwhelmed with inconsequential minutiae that I was in any danger of confusing this work with the relentlessly pedantic Patrick O'Brian (who impresses so many people with his fabulously tedious vocabulary that they have come to consider his work as literature). I am curious as to whether the author can keep me interested in this heroine over the course of multiple books - so few series really hold up well as the lead character progresses (or does not). Certainly the setting has the ring of authenticity rather than merely fine research, and the author has a knack for the occasional turn of phrase that can make mystery occasionally magical - not so much that the author seemed to be reaching for poetry, but enough to capture my fancy and make me eager to turn the page. I'm looking forward to reading A Fall in Denver next.	2004-12-06

Paul Wollf, Emerson's newest protagonist, is another superlative example of a deeply flawed individual who wins the reader's sympathy despite some character traits which, if Wolff were a real person, would make a sane person keep him at the proverbial barge pole's distance. But make no mistake, Emerson has not recreated his previous hero, Swope, in Wollf. Where Swope was a mindless womanizer, Wollf is a shy guy who knows he's not good enough for a good woman. Where Swope was a popular guy around the firehouse, Wollf holds the entire world at bay, his sternly leashed violence like a guard dog between him and his fellow creatures. But as in \\"Into the Inferno\\" Emerson does tell a thumping good action yarn all the while interlacing it with the hero's movement towards self-discovery. If Swope was the guy you hoped would be taking you home after the party, then Wollf is the guy you hope you're waking up with on a quiet Sunday morning.    As always, Emerson's well-honed descriptions and his ear for dialogue boost a story that in less gifted hands might end up merely workmanlike. Example: \\"I suck dark smoke all the way up. It tastes like the undercarriage of a fertilizer truck might.\\" What an image! Makes me want a swig of Listerine bad!    Another plus for this author -- and some may disagree with me on this, but so what? They'll be wrong! -- is that he is so NOT afraid to stretch his skills, I mean really work at his craft, and the proof is in how he told this story from so many different points of view and still made the story cohesive and kept the flow of events and emotions constant. That can't have been easy, and it had to have been a conscious choice right from the beginning of the book.    I wish I wasn't going to have to wait another year or more for the next book by Earl Emerson. And I wish he'd do another book tour through the Midwest sometime! Why does the left coast get all the breaks?    Thanks, too, Mr. Emerson, for the opening quote from Elmer Slezak. I misshim!	2004-08-06

For that alone I could kiss Lucas Swain, never mind that he is a secondhand version of John Sandford's fabulous cop Lucas Davenport. Because of the rather ripped-off version of Davenport (one of my all-time favorite fictional characters)and because the intrigue isn't terribly intriguing, I gave this only 3 stars. That isn't to say I hated the book or that I didn't enjoy it: The banter between hero and heroine is pretty funny - but just a little too much like Davenport and one of his ladies to feel original. If I hadn't read 'Cry No More' right before this one I might have liked this book better, but CNM was a top-notch and very moving story. My expectations may have been a little too high coming off that book. I think I'll go re-read one of Sandford's books now!	2004-07-20

If the reader is looking for a hotbed of smouldering sensuality this is NOT the book for you, but since I read for character and plot and not for gratuitous sexual encounters, this IS the book for me. Granted the plot is more or less the same as in Pride and Prejudice, but that is a tale that has been told more than once and in worse ways (the detestable Bridget Jones's Diary springs to mind), so I forgive the lack of originality in plot - at least the author borrowed from a classic and not from some hormonally-charged drivel like Rosemary Rogers or ellipsis-ridden, eye-crossing puerile pap from Barbara Cartland.<br />Smouldering sensuality would have been terribly misplaced in a character built up over 5 previous books as being a singularly cold and undemonstrative man. Wulfric's gradual breakdown into a human being was perfectly told - too much warmth, too much change and he would not have been believeable. And any lessening in his view of his self-consequence and personal responsibilities would have made me throw the book across the room. Thankfully, the author remained true to the character she had invested so much time in.<br />I was a little impatient with the heroine though - her thinking seemed muddled at times, and while that may have been true to HER character, I found it obstructive, dragging the story out far longer than it needed to be. And I think that if there had been 5 previous books about Christine Derrick then the last book would have had to be called Slightly Stupid. Fortunately Wulfric and his perceptive siblings make up for the heroine's foot-dragging. The scene where Wulfric says someone should have warned him the water was cold was a treat, perfect imagery for a man no longer made of ice. This is the only book of this series that I immediately went back and re-read favorite scenes. As far as I'm concerned the others were just advance PR for Wulfric's sweet romance.	2004-06-27

Cardinal remains an interesting figure, not a perfect man, but a decent man, and there are ups and downs in his life and the investigation that mirror reality in its long-on-pain/short-on-bliss manner. If you're looking for that happy-ever-after ending, this is not the book for you. But if you like salt and grit layered in 3 inches of ice, this is one fine police procedural. I only wish I knew if Cardinal ever recommended Kiki B. for a job with Deckard!	2004-06-06

The rating is based on judging this book against only the author's body of work. If I rated it in comparison to other authors I might have rated it a star higher. So what don't I like about this book? Wellllll... At first the mention of the Blood Work movie was kind of cool. And so was bringing back the Poet... And Agent Walling. But with so many references to the movie and so many characters from prior books reappearing, it all began to annoy me, especially since it became so flagrant that it seems downright self-indulgent of the author. Plot-wise: What began fine, moved into great, started tripping itself up on its own details, not to mention the ever-changing psychological profile of the Poet that seemed to alter to fit whatever scene was being written. I don't want to print spoilers here so let me just say that the ending revelation regarding McCaleb's death could not only be seen coming a mile off but was wholly unbelievable. Also I felt disappointed in the first person voice of Harry Bosch, but that might be my own taste rather than any fault of the author. For my money, I like Harry kept just a little beyond the reader's touch: We can know him, but we can never KNOW him, if you take my meaning. The haunting quality of Harry's persona escaped me in this book. Will I be around to buy Connelly's next book? Absolutely. And I'll hope it turns out to be as good as my favorite, Angels Flight.	2004-05-09

US	53063965	R1BD0OX4P7F47K	0345445910	963983439	Into the Inferno	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Emerson's best work yet!	I can't recommend this book highly enough.<br />Amazing how the man can write such a dark tale about a man facing an imminent, ugly, and irrevocable end (brain death), and still find so many ways to make me laugh. Swope, our \\"hero\\" if he can be called that, is one of those guys who in real life makes my eyes cross, he's so inept and cowardly in his personal relationships, and so sure that the trip wire in those relationships could never have been put there by him. Yet he's drawn so finely by Emerson that Swope's flaws are part of the attraction -- you just can't help liking the idiot! He's flesh and blood and so very human.<br />The plot -- you can read about that in the professional reviews. Suffice it to say, this is one fabulous page-turner. Swope is running against the clock, and the short chapters -- every single one contributing to moving the plot forward; no wasted words here! -- seem to add to the quick pacing.<br />As for Emerson's prose, it's always been very, very good, but in this book I think he has taken his work to a new level. In his hands Crude American Vernacular becomes Sheer Poetry, and I'd love to provide examples but I doubt if amazon.com will print those words. Just... the letters MF now have a whole different connotation than the common street profanity I've always heard!<br />This is a beautiful book, filled with both honesty and humor (I mean laugh-out-loud funny). More than a simple thriller, we get the inside scoop on a man's self-examination when facing the total devastation of his life. How Swope comes to grips with his own sins, and the sins of others, is as fascinating as the fires and aid calls that Emerson describes to perfection. And yeah, I might even have got a bit wet around the eyes at the end. <br />And I want Mel Gibson to play Swope in the movie...<br />And one last note: The best, I mean THE VERY BEST chapter titles yet!	2003-03-07

One of the worst was the heroine referring to a garment \\"two sizes too small.\\" Standard clothing sizes in 1749? Yeah, right. Does anyone really think that the gifted, intelligent writer who brought us quality work in the Sanguinet series and the Golden Chronicles could possibly have written this book? It reads like a poor imitation of Veryan. The humor here seems forced, the romance contrived, and the main characters just not very interesting. And it hurts my feelings to say these things in regard to an author whose work I have treasured for years. The quality of the work began eroding -- IMHO -- with the first of the Riddle series (although the first two books were ok; not great but ok) and has declined with each successive book. It's very disheartening.	2003-03-01

For those who find O'Brian unnecessarily long-winded and overwhelmingly pretentious, give Stockwin's books a try (start with 'Kydd,' the first in the series). Stockwin has taken the unusual tack of starting his series with a non-sailor, a pressed man, and has introduced both him and the reader to late 18th century shipboard life. This isn't Hornblower or --thank God! -- Aubrey, Kydd is an altogether original character. We learn as he learns, we see storms, battles, maneuvers, all of it through his eyes and from his position on board a frigate. This is very different from seeing things only through the eyes of the captain, which is what is presented in most nautical fiction. Kydd will most likely rise in rank as the series progresses, but the reader gets to make that most enjoyable journey with him.<br />I note that other critics have taken issue with Stockwin's actual writing skill. I have no problem with the man's craft or talent. In fact I have yet to read a fictional account of rounding the Horn that was as descriptive, passionate, frightening and inspiring as Stockwin's account in 'Artemis.' I enjoyed this book a great deal, and regret only that I have to wait another year for book 3 in the series.	2002-07-10

I will add that Emerson creates vivid, breathing, flawed human beings whose thoughts and feelings and actions interest me, and none more so than firefighter John Finney. This book is begging to be made into a movie! <br />As for another reviewer's remark that Emerson wrote this book to cash in on 9/11, that's an unjustified accusation of his character. This book was probably already in the publisher's hands by 9/11, or near enough to, in order to be galleyed and proofed, and a book tour planned, for an April/May release.<br />I'm glad to see Emerson's publisher is finally throwing some weight into supporting one of his books. With a little PR this guy could be on the bestseller lists in another book or two. And IMHO, it's long overdue.	2002-07-01

Melancholy, soul searching, and the universal question: How much of events that we &quot;remember&quot; actually occurred? 'The Blue Last' meanders these gloomy labyrinths to great effect. Yet, I confess, I hate it when Richard Jury gets depressed -- Ms. Grimes's depiction of it is so penetrating that I get a bit down myself. The mystery of the child-swapping is perhaps less intriguing than the mystery of how our minds and emotions and perceptions work together to create memory and to blind us to reality, but it all overlaps as Richard plumbs this internal mystery only to find it continues to blind him to what is immediately around him: Danger (just as Diane Demorney predicted!). I'm curious to see what effect this will have on Jury's character in the future. Will he stop muddling around with all the wrong women and find the right one? Or has she been right in front of him all this time? I can't wait to see what happens to Richard next.	2002-02-23

This tale of a hitman and man hunting him becomes circular as each seeks to destroy the other. The book is strung end to end with psychological tension. How can Perry (anyone???) ever have imagined this series of traps and near-captures and hairsbreadth escapes all turning and tumbling as within the same scene the hunter becomes the hunted and then is suddenly the hunter again? Prescott is an amazing character, and though I'd like to think Perry will write more about him I'm still waiting for Chinese Gordon (&quot;Metzger's Dog&quot;) to make a reappearance! <br />A year? Do I really have to wait a year or more for another of Perry's books? C'mon, if the publishers can continue to crank out wordy tomes of unedited mishmash several times yearly from Stephen King, SURELY Perry could be published more often than annually!

He has a crisp and lucid style -- never degenerates into the hardboiled (though I quite like that style on occasion) -- and he not only understands the way people act, but what's better, he knows how they REact. John Walker is bit younger, more naive, more conventional than any of Perry's protagonists I can recall, and he is the perfect foil for the cynical, earthy Stillman. Perry has a classic gift for delivering dialogue guaranteed to make me laughingly snort my cup of tea, an example being Stillman's theory that it's the soothing quality of doughnuts that makes the Red Cross foist them off on disaster victims. It's funny because, like so much that's funny, it's partly true. What more can I say? If you don't read this book it's your loss. And when you suddenly discover it in some used bookstore 10 years hence, you'll wonder why you ever resisted in the first place!	2002-01-08

The first 50 pages made me wonder -- they don't read like any Veryan book I've read. A friend of mine who is also a long-time fan of Ms. Veryan got the same impression. The entire plot doesn't sound like something Veryan would contrive, chiefly because it IS so contrived. This was not up to the usual high Veryan standards. I was very disappointed with this book.	2002-01-08

With this work Woodman is trying to fill the gap in history on the various British naval officers whose courage and ingenuity and seamanship were all that held revolutionary France at bay for years until the British army got its act together. It's not only a valiant effort, it is -- as Woodman points out -- long overdue.<br />I'm not sure if the chronological aspect of the telling doesn't do the stories an injustice. It lends a hit-skip atmosphere to the book, as we read about the heroics of one captain, only to find more about him several chapters down the line. After finishing the book I went to the index and collected all the pages on various captains and went back and read them together and I truly think most of the information about their battles would have been better grouped together.<br />Two HUGE problems with this book from my point of view though. One, the index needs some work. I hate being referred to pages where there is absolutely no mention of the topic/ship/person I am seeking. And two -- who the devil proofed this book? Because I don't think it was anyone accustomed to reading English! The typos and grammatical errors are overwhelming in number. I found this a serious distraction, and frankly, it is inexcusable. Woodman's work deserves better, because even though I would never count this book as one of the great histories of the Age of Sail, it is rather a one-of-a-kind book. <br />As for the detail content of the book, I've long wanted to read more details of some of the famous sea battles, detail such as how the ships were maneuvered in some of those one-on-one battles, and Woodman does supply this. I still want more, but I confess to some greed on my part there. <br />Oh, one other thing, the author does need to provide a bit more argument on some of the characterizations he draws of these captains. For example, he repeatedly refers to Edward Pellew's cupidity, but except for one incident committed by Pellew's son, Woodman never gives any examples where Pellew allowed this attribute to interfere with his duty. Sir Sidney Smith is drawn as boastful and vainglorious -- which he WAS -- but no real argument is made as to how Woodman arrived at this conclusion; a couple of brief examples would have helped make some of his statements look more fact than opinion.<br />I'll keep this book on my shelf, and will hope Woodman may someday consider a revised edition.	2001-08-12

Where O'Brian is roundabout, Stockwin is direct. Where I want to shoot Jack Aubrey, I want to embrace Kydd. This isn't (or has not yet become) the story of a heroic sea-captain, this is the tale of an impressed man who enters a world the existence of which he was previously unaware; a young man both impressionable and already formed, one who -- like most of us -- does not deal well with despair and endures mostly because of the company of others to support us through life's little tribulations. I see other reviewers have decided the episodic quality of the book is a negative. However, I rather think that the life of a common 18th century seaman WAS episodic: Days and even weeks of tedious, mind-numbing labor interspersed with minutes of harrowing danger. The first Hornblower tale (chronologically speaking that is) is also episodic, as is the first book (again chronologically) featuring Richard Bolitho. If there are some rather improbable coincidences -- even the fine Captain Marryat was prone to those and they do not always detract from the excitement of the narrative. I rather think Thomas Paine Kydd will find his literary sealegs soon enough. This first book seems designed to be introductory to Kydd, his friend Renzi, and to 18th century ships and British navy. Even so, the story moves along quickly and I am ready to read the sequel NOW.	2001-07-15

Since I have never set foot in a salle, have never even seen the divisive pistol-grip, I cannot express an informed opinion on that topic, nor on the flick, nor on sport fencing versus classical fencing. But I can say that I found this book to be highly motivational (made a couch potato like me want to jump up and grab a foil right now -- fortunately for some poor maitre since I lack all depth perception, I restrained myself), and a strong proponent of some notions I'm pretty fond of: Self-discipline; initiative; perserverance; doing things the right way, not the easy way; facing your fears; standing up for what you believe in, even when -- ESPECIALLY when what you believe in is unpopular or 'old-fashioned' or 'unrealistic.' It's about substance and style, means and ends, and at its most basic, it's about the moral choices we face every day. I'm a financial analyst, not a fencer, and I got a lot more out of this book than a whole week in the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People seminar.	2001-03-16

I enjoyed Terry McCaleb's character far more in this book than in &quot;Blood Work.&quot;  Mr. Connolly does a spiffy job of taking us through the profiler's logic and thought processes, and he somehow manages to keep track of minutiae that would send most authors screaming for Prozac. The only flaw that I see in this book is an arguable one: This was really a McCaleb story, far more so than a Harry Bosch story. And the fact is, for me, Harry remains a far more intriguing character than McCaleb. So I give this book 4 stars instead of 5, only because I wanted more Bosch!

Unliked the other reviewers thus far, I have not read other accounts of  polar expeditions, never found the subject intriguing enough when there  were so many other histories clamoring for my attention. I'm still not sure  what persuaded me to buy this little book, but I am SO glad I did. I found  it sufficiently detailed to give me the progressive pictures of ineptitude,  boredom, labor, frostbite, incompatibility, isolation, hunger, despair, et  al,  without becoming bogged down in tedium. By virtue of having waited so  many years to pen his account, McKinlay is probably more even-handed in the  telling than he would have been otherwise, and makes the book a moving  experience rather simply a bitter one. Kudos to the man, he was indeed a  canny Scot, and has related a story worthy of being captured on film.	2000-08-27

Glaring errors in the  proofing can be very distracting.<br />As for getting Davenport to settle down  and commit to one woman, I hope he never does! Or at least, not with  Weather Karkinnon, she's the dullest of all Sandford's fine creations and I  have yet to figure out what Davenport sees in her.

I first read this book when I was 10 years old, and I loved it, checking it out of the school library at every opportunity. After leaving that school at age 12 I never saw the book again, and over the past 32 years I  have periodically searched for it. I realized if I did find the book it may  very well turn out to be not the enchanting read I remembered so fondly.  Little did I know! &quot;The Reb and the Redcoats&quot; is very  well-written, with an engrossing perspective on the American Revolution. A  young American rebel is a POW in a household (in England) whose head is a  Redcoat recovering from wounds suffered in the war. Through their  interactions we come to appreciate the humanity of the people who make up  both sides of an issue. If there is a fault with this book, it is only that  the heroic nature and adventures of the Reb seem a bit beyond the grasp of  a 15-year-old boy. Still, if Hollywood would only age him a few years, they  could make a very compelling film of this tale.	2000-02-05

So much so, that the ending of the book left me wanting to know more about how Jack would handle the emotional shocks he is handed as the riddle is resolved.  <br /> While Jack held my attention, it was (as usual) one of Veryan's minor charactors who won my heart: Paige Manderville, the Dandy of Mayfair. No doubt  Paige will earn his own book at some future point. <br /> Overall, I thought this book to be well-crafted,  and is perhaps Veryan's most intriguing mystery. In comparison with other Veryan books, this one  did not seem to contain as much humor, nor are the lovers star-crossed (unless you count the incident where Jack is popped upside the head with a  skillet), but this should not lead other Veryan  fans to think this is not one of her better books. Jack ranks third among my favorite Veryan heroes, only just behind Roland (&quot;The Dedicated Villain&quot;) and Tony (&quot;Love Alters Not&quot;).

The lady just can't write'em  fast enough to suit me. I'm already anticipating her next book.	1997-10-26
