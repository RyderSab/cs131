Wonderfully inspiring and an amazing example of how misguided some parents can be--that fundamentally intelligent people could put their children in such jeopardy and cause them so much heartache.  I was so proud of Ms. Walls for pulling herself up out of the quagmire and taking a couple of her siblings along with her.  What a gal!  Don't miss this great read.	2005-09-23

Having read many diaries of Pioneer women, this one attracted me because Jean Rio started out in England with a small fortune at her disposal.  I was disappointed that so much of the book was wasted on Brigham Young and so little of it on Jean.	2005-09-23

At the time I knew little about Restoration England and found Amber's exploits to be captivating.  I read the book many times after that first time and still find Ms. Winsor's attention to detail and historical background to be engrossing.  When compared to historical novels written today, it is by far, still among the best.  I don't find the characters dated and I marvel at the frank handling of sensitive subjects like abortion and life on the streets of London in the 1700's.  It is easy to see why, when it was published in 1944, it caused a ruckus!   <br /> <br />I admit it did go on a little too long at the end when Amber seemed to have exhausted all possibilities in England and one had the feeling there would be a sequel that took place in America.  Of course, that didn't happen, although Winsor's book \\"Wanderers Eastward, Waderers West\\" might have started out to be that book.  <br /> <br />\\"Forever Amber\\" is second only to GWTW in my library and I still find the characters to be colorful and memorable.  I would love to see a new film production of it with some good actors--the original film didn't do the book justice. <br /> <br />	2005-07-28

Eliot found out nothing (or wasn't willing to print) any really personal information about Grant's relationships with any of his wives or co-stars.  What Eliot does seem to know a lot about is every movie that was ever made, whether Grant was in it or not.  I was looking for something much more personal than a chronology of his movies.	2005-03-07

There were glimmers of adventure here and there and one certainly comes to appreciate the drudgery and boredom which was part of everyday life in the wilderness--not to mention the misery of living thru a damp, cold, cheerless winter--something which most of us have never experienced in our modern world.  I missed the time travel element in this book since all of the main characters are now living in the 1700's.  Hope Diana will take a bit longer to do the Revolutionary War chapter of this story which should present all kinds of plot twists.	2003-12-22

Having spent a month in Africa many years ago,it was easy for me to understand the appeal of that country.  The smells, the scenery and colors are like none anywhere else in the world.  My first reaction to the book was &quot;why would parents want to raise children in such dangerous and potentially fatal surroundings?&quot;  I am certain, however, that Bobo would not have traded her childhood for any pampered &quot;normal&quot; upbringing that could have been provided. Likewise,we her readers, would never have gotten to enjoy this book. <br />I wish the author would have gone into a little more detail about the circumstances that brought her family to Africa and why they persisted in this difficult life, but maybe that is fodder for another book.  Let's hope so!	2003-02-20

I enjoyed every minute of the story of the struggle to conquer the environment and mold it to the white man's idea of a civilized place.  Sadly, I am not convinced the developers will allow the Everglades to exist much longer.  I am grateful to have lived in a time when its wonders are still available to me.	2003-02-20

Another disfunctional southern family but one of the most engaging since GWTW!  Hilarious and sad, brought back many feelings from my own childhood.

I have just finished this first book of this series and haven't been so enthused about a new author for many years.  Her wonderful attention to detail and the contrasts between life in the 1940's and 1740's were great!  What impressed me most of all was her ability to write in Gaelic dialect so well, I could just HEAR it!  (The fact that one of my best friends is Scottish helped a little I guess.)  This book has EVERYTHING--history, lovable characters, great love scenes, and nasty villains.  I can't wait to start the second one!	2001-07-06

I think it highly unlikely that a girl from a good family could have carried on an affair like this without being discovered, but stranger things have probably happened.  Shreve can't seem to make her characters come alive for me for some reason--&quot;The Pilot's Wife&quot; was the same--both stories had great potential but were a little flat.	2001-07-06

Hearing it read with a British accent may have given it more interest or maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a light mystery.  I &quot;listened&quot; to &quot;Death in Kenya&quot;, another Kaye novel, and found it much more entertaining.	2001-07-06

Modern slavery cloaked as charity.  The characters are so real, however, and the glimpses of lives I will never live (I hope)so engrossing, this will be a book I will remember for a long time.  How sad that children are produced as carelessly as rabbits and cared for with less concern.  Thank you, Janet Fitch, for this book.	2001-06-21

Maybe it was the writer's fault, but this story just wasn't presented the way I thought it would be.

She takes unpleasant subjects and makes them bearable and interesting--not to mention humourous in some ways.  Am surprised that some readers have criticized the book for being depressing--divorce can never be anything else--regardless of how you deal with it.  When I was divorced, I was only 28 with no children and my whole life ahead of me--I never looked back; which isn't to say it wasn't mind shattering.  For a middle aged woman with a child, it has to be positively devastating!  I think this book showed women how there is something positive in even the most menial job and that nice people, and even love, can come disguised in the plainest brown wrappers.	2001-06-07

Am enjoying this third part of M.M.Kaye's autobiography as much as the previous two--maybe more!  Her description of the death of her father so mirrors my own, I was reminded of my sister's statement that &quot;nothing ever turns out the way one thinks it will.&quot;  Ms. Kaye has such a way with description and words, and it is fascinating to read of these last days in countries like  China, Japan and India that were irrevocably changed by WWII.  I hope there will be a Part IV!! I am filled with a longing for these seemingly gentler times, even though I was born long after they were already a memory to Ms. Kaye.	2001-03-20

Very disappointing, however.  I felt like a 4 year old being given a lesson on ecology.  The characters in the book were wonderfully drawn and I was very interested in the complexities of their lives, but the lecture on almost every page about conservation was a little annoying.  A little goes a long way, especially if your audience is already pretty well versed in the subject.	2001-01-10

The parts in the nursing home were a little hard to take since I have had too much personal experience with those recently, but the humor that came out when you least expected it, made me keep reading.  I agree with those who said there are many passages worth rereading and remembering and, altho I don't think I am personally capable of that kind of unfulfilled love, I have found myself thinking many times in my life that a few days of that kind of love would be worth a lifetime of the mediocrity that most of us endure in our lovelives for the sake of having a mate.  It's a beautiful love story wrapped around one of the most tragic wars in the history of the world and the scenes evoked are as good as those in &quot;Battle Cry&quot;, my favorite book about WWII in the Pacific.  I thought Hull did a great job of putting himself in the body of an old man since he himself is half the age of the narrator of the book. I hope Hull is working on another one.	2000-11-23

Ho-hum--just another book about a disfunctional southern family with the requisite mother who spends her life in bed while her children raise themselves.  Her children did an excellent job of raising themselves, however, and maybe that is the lesson to be learned.  Not everyone needs a &quot;soccer mom&quot; and a &quot;corporate dad&quot; to amount to something.  The book is a nice light read, but I didn't find much humor in it and I wish someone would write a book about the South that didn't portray the women as spineless, psychopaths. Scarlett O'Hara remains the only heroine who wasn't a doormat for every man she came in contact with!	2000-11-14

Having travelled in Africa shortly after they attained their independence, I have never forgotten the magic of the place which may very well stem from the  fact that it is so very primitive and such a stark contrast to our modern  world. I never cease to be amazed that there are people who will devote  their lives to trying to bring the natives of this amazing country into the  21st century.  Their stark poverty and chronic starvation seem to be beyond  all efforts to help them. I feel sorry for this family who is at the mercy  of their zealot father.  How dare he submit them to the dangers and poverty  of living in the Congo. How selfish of him to inflict his passions on his  helpless children.  Hopefully, as I read on, there will be some  justification. I am thoroughly enjoying the characters--they are diverse  and unique and, tho somewhat precocious for children, I don't find them  unbelievable. Children are a lot smarter than most of us adults give them  credit for being.  I did have a problem with some of the technical  weaknesses--they seem to be totally unprepared for the living conditions in  which they find themselves.  Didn't either of the adults think to ask  before they left the States what awaited them where they were going? Did  Orleanna really think there would be a modern kitchen with a refrigerator  and an oven and electricity?<br />It is still a totally engrossing read and I  can't wait to get back to it--	2000-05-31

Ms. Kaye has the most wonderful way of describing scenes, colors, and events of an era never to be seen again.  Her family led a story-book life of adventure and she makes it look so easy to overcome the forces of nature  that were part of living there with very few, if any, modern conveniences.   It was a delicious read and I hope Ms. Kaye is busily at work on the next  book of her travels in China!  I am grateful for this journey back into a  gentler, quieter time.	2000-05-28

The angst of being torn from a pleasant, if not privileged, life and the rigours of surviving all the degrading and humiliating tortures and deprivations of  the camps is told in such riveting detail.  Sophie's amazing strength and  cunning is remarkable.  That she could make it into such a well told story,  is more amazing still.  This will always be one of my favorite books.  I  found it very inspirational.	1999-11-21

The ambivalence of the Civil War, the stark poverty of  life in the hinterlands of cities, the steadfastness and singlemindedness  of the main characters who accept their lot and plod on make great  listening.  I often wonder if people today could survive the conditions  which these people had to endure.  Beautifully read and very engrossing.	1999-11-01
