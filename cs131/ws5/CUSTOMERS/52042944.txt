Honestly, this children's book is a good gift for many adults as well because it is beautifully illustrated and complete with a French and English translation of the story's events on every single page. Hebert-Collins calls upon her family's ancestors to create this accurate piece of historical fiction. Although I'm not a teacher, I'd like to think this book would be included on a required reading list of all students of North American history, regardless of how old or young they may be.	2005-09-18

Meeting up with writer Shiela Hebert-Collins at a breakfast table while we were both guests at an inn in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, showed me how some writers are working hard to keep North America's French culture alive through stories. Hebert-Collins uses her own French-Acadian heritage to teach children about the Louisiana French-Acadian heritage by writing Cajun fairy tales.   <br /> <br />Usually, it's difficult to explain the English translations of French words to children unless they learn and use the words in familiar ways. But writer Sheila Hebert-Collins, a native of Louisiana living in Naples, Florida, has one clever way of bringing French heritage and language to children. Her Cajun fairy tales are spattered with a variety of French words intertwined into the storytelling.  Franco-Americans who grew up speaking French will enjoy these clever bi-lingual children's stories. <br /> <br />Hebert-Collins and I happened to sit at the same breakfast table when we were visiting Annapolis Royal, in Nova Scotia.  We were staying at the same Victorian bed and breakfast mansion which was loaded with antique furniture and several crystal chandeliers hanging from the breakfast room ceiling.  Hebert-Collins was wearing a sweatshirt with the screen print image of a blue, white and red French-Acadian flag printed on the front.  We immediately struck up a conversation about the children's books she writes for Pelican Publishing Company, in Gretna, Louisiana. <br />  <br />For example, \\"Jacques et la Canne a Sucre\\" is a Cajun version of the Jack and the Beanstalk children's story.  In the Cajun version, Hebert-Collins writes about a sugar cane pole instead of a bean stalk.  Moreover, the Cajun version uses many French words in the dialogue mixed with sentences written in a vernacular English common to the Cajun culture.   <br /> <br />Most important, the French words Hebert-Collins uses are given phonetic pronunciation and an English translation in the footnotes of every colorful and beautifully illustrated page of the story. In this retelling of the familiar tale, poor Jacques and his mother struggle to survive by living on a houseboat on the Louisiana bayou. Jacques and his mother earn a meager living by selling crawfish.   <br /> <br />The story starts when Jacques mother tells him to \\"Dpche-toi, before other crawfish farmers get to market!\\"   <br /> <br />In other words, she wants Jacques to sell the crawfish they caught before competitors take away their small business.  At the end of the page, the French words \\"dpche-toi\\" are phonetically written as \\"day-pesh-twah\\" and the English translation is \\"hurry up\\". Later in the story, an old Cajun sees Jacques and asks, \\"T garcon. What you got in dat sack, dere?\\" Again, at the bottom of the dialogue, the French colloquial \\"t garcon\\" is given the phonetic pronunciation \\"tee gahr-SOHN\\" and the meaning is \\"little boy\\".   <br /> <br />Although other Cajun writers write entertaining cultural folk tales, Hebert-Collins' books stand out because of the familiar uses of French colloquial words in her characters' dialogues, intertwined with vernacular English phrases commonly used by bayou people.    <br />  <br />Hebert-Collins signed a copy of \\"Jacques et la Canne a Sucre\\" while the two of us visited over our delicious breakfast.  She writes in her inscription, \\"What luck to meet you here in Nova Scotia!  Enjoy this Cajun tale and remember me.\\" <br />  <br />	2005-09-17

Too many Franco-Americans (with ancestral roots in French-Canada) are quickly amalgamating into the mainstream of American culture without writing their special family stories.  Fortunately, Charleen Touchette, a Woonsocket, Rhode Island writer and artist now living in New Mexico, puts both of her pleasingly creative talents together in \\"It Stops With Me: Memoir of a Cannuck Girl\\".   <br />Touchette writes about her Franco-American roots by relating simple, often bittersweet and even brutal experiences growing up as a typical French Catholic girl in Woonsocket and later as an accomplished artist.   <br />Moreover, Touchette energizes her autobiography's prose with a series of original black, and white and color print blocks. In other words, \\"It Stops With Me\\" expresses Touchette's Franco-American creativity using prose accentuated by her surprisingly cutting edge original art describing absorbing coming of age experiences.  Her journey from a parochial Franco-American into her adult life is fraught with opportunities, along with unexpected harsh challenges.  Her life is ordinary in some ways but hardly a nostalgic cake walk.  <br />\\"It Stops With Me\\" is at its best when Touchette looks back and elevates normal Franco-American experiences to familiarities we can identify with.  For example, she describes cooking with her \\"Ma Tantes\\" or getting ready to receive First Holy Communion at Woonsocket's Eglise Prcieux-Sang (Church of Precious Blood).   <br />Discord arises at a young age. Growing up as a French Roman Catholic girl is an underlying theme. Touchette's typical childhood is without the benefit of feeling safe at home, as she depicts in one of her portraits of a \\"Not a Picture Perfect Family\\".  <br />Rather, Touchette's absorbing life story endures familial stress, social and personal conflicts, even leading to physical ailments, which haunt her into adult years. <br />Touchette's hard hitting narrative is set apart from others of the modern autobiographic genre by the intimate and complicated relationships she shares with her family.  Delving even deeper into her private spiral are the intense personal investigations Touchette undertakes with regard to her sad relationship with her father. <br />Nevertheless, in spite of the particular circumstances, it's typical of Franco-Americans to harbor deep attachments for their relatives and parents regardless of obvious flaws, shortcomings or even family violence.  Female family role models are especially strong in Touchette's life.  \\"Although my Maman was a devout Catholic, she was a strong supporter of my right to freedom of expression,\\" writes Touchette.  In fact, her female relatives were outraged when Touchette even considered not going to college after high school.  In her Woonsocket Franco-Americans world, Touchette writes about how curious it was to be singled out for college when no other woman in her family ever went beyond a high school education.   <br />Throughout the autobiography, her French heritage is front and center, even when she embraces the peace of Judaism.   <br />Many of the book's chapters are charmingly led by simple French titles.   <br />Touchette's talent as a creative writer moves the reader beyond the dark side of her autobiography. Using the power of words, she inspires us to learn more about her as an individual woman with a spellbinding story to tell. Touchette does a good job explaining the pros and cons of the personal contrasts she inherited from her religious and ethnic roots.  This is a well written autobiography, nominated for book awards, with a progressive social focus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-15

The Acadians actually tried to remain neutral in the series of conflicts known as The French and Indian wars between the British and the French for control of Canada and North America.  Acadians preferred trading to war. They continued their commerce with the French in Quebec and France, with the British and, also, with New Englanders. Acadians prospered with this economic freedom. <br />Most historic accounts of the 1755 expulsion focus on the actual incident and what happened subsequently to the Acadians who were \\"scattered to the winds\\" in boats where they sailed to ports on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Faragher's history takes the time to describe the nature of the \\"neutral\\" Acadians prior to the expulsion, or those who wanted to remain free and aloof from the continental conflicts.  <br />Faragher describes how the Acadians became victims of the schemes some claim were premeditated by British Lieutenant Governor Charles Lawrence (1709-1760) and Massachusetts Governor William Shirley (1694-1771).   <br />Using a classic propaganda campaign to stir up negative news about the Acadians, Faragher describes how Lawrence and Shirley preyed on colonial anti-French sentiments of the time. Lawrence used weaknesses he perceived in the Acadian social or political systems to justify writing a deportation order, forcing them out of the property they developed during over a century of settlement in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley region. <br />Back in Massachusetts, Governor Shirley sought the assistance of John Winslow to supplement the British troops in Nova Scotia, thereby contributing to the Acadian expulsion scheme.  Recruitment of Massachusetts militia began in early February, 1755, immediately after the colony's Assembly voted to approve an expedition to Nova Scotia in a secret session, writes Faragher.  Winslow was a highly regarded New England citizen and a seasoned military man. Due to his good reputation, he quickly recruited about 2000 Massachusetts militia to join him and the British in executing the \\"Great and Nobel Scheme\\" of 1755, writes Faragher.   Winslow's recruits were motivated by clerics and others who preached against the Acadians who were Roman Catholics.  \\"French Catholics must be evicted from L'Acadie at the muzzle of our guns and at the point of our Swords\\",  wrote Governor Shirley on February 18, 1755. <br />Lawrence supposedly ordered the Acadian expulsion without authority to do so, but modern historians have tried implicating the British Crown in the incident. <br />Faragher keeps the horror of Le Grand Derangement alive with this well documented accumulation of data about a horrible incident in America's colonial history.   <br /> <br />	2005-04-23

Loving God and devotion to the sacred scriptures are lots different than talking to the saints or seeing visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Honestly, those fascinating phenomena are alien to a mortal soul who works hard to practice my Roman Catholic faith, like me. Therefore, I'm absolutely consoled by \\"A Still, Small Voice\\", by Father Benedict J. Groeschel, because he explains how, oftentimes, even the saints themselves i.e., Saint Catherine of Siena, for example, as well as others around them could be deceived by mystical revelations. As human beings, saints are subject to a memory snafu once in awhile. Many ordinary people do not disclose personal revelations to others until some life event or spiritual director allows them to recount their experience, like Saint Catherine Laboure, for example.  Also explained, in wonderfully ordinary prose, is the nature of revelations, how they can be misrepresented and justifiably even dismissed as being real. This summary account of how to better understand mystical or supernatural revelations is an appetizer into other, more in depth, readings by quoted writers like Father Thomas Dubay, author of \\"The Fire Within\\", plus the mystical writings of St. Teresa of Avila. Thoroughly footnoted, the information provided in this wonderful read gives credibility to a field of religion many professional clergy would just as soon avoid. I will send copies of this book to several clergy friends of mine who are spiritual guides themselves, because I believe it is a must read for everybody who claims to experience divine revelations but, mostly, it's a source of comfort for those of us who are simply in awe of these profoundly mystical experiences. Moreover, \\"A Still, Small Voice\\" stands alone as meditation by itself, even for a skeptic or non-religious person.	2005-02-27

Gerard Robichaud wrote this novel in 1961. But, the cultural immersion described in this heartwarming story about a Franco-American family is more important today then when Robichaud wrote and published his story, because the culture he writes about is quickly disappearing.  Robichaud based Papa Martel on his family's experiences while growing up in Lewiston, Maine. Let's face it, most Americans don't know anything about Franco-Americans, except what they read on canned spaghetti.  As a culture, Franco-Americans pre-date the arrival of the Pilgrims in Massachusetts in 1620 by 17 or more years, with the first settlement of French arriving in St.Croix Island, Maine in 1604. Nevertheless, Papa Martel is not as much about history as about culture.  Robichaud tells the plot in 10 parts, including stories he heard while listening to his relatives talk using their typical animated gestures during family Saturday night soirees or at family reunions.  What sets Papa Martel apart, however, is the terrific writing.  This book is waiting for a screen-play or, at the very least, a stage adaptation.  Read Papa Martel for sheer enjoyment and wind up learning something about Maine and New England's Franco-American culture in the meantime.  The re-release of Papa Martel by University of Maine press helped to revive interest in Franco-American culture in the Maine media.	2004-12-04

Except, in \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\", Iain Pears presents this bleak period of English history in an intellectual thriller-way, so as to make a reader ask for more. This is a captivating mystery, using this black period of Restoration mysticism and intrigue as the central themes of a suspense packed murder-story, full of strong characters and plenty of twists.  Moreover, the \\"instance of the fingerpost\\", meaning, in sort of an Old-English way, \\"He did it...\\" leaves the reader wondering \\"what if\\" questions and even a sense of imagining whether or not English history isn't the real mystery in this novel, rather than a whodunit murder? Perhaps English history is not at all what we are taught.  \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" is one of my favorite books and recommended highly for the reader who wants to sink into something truly unusual and entertaining, both at the same time.	2004-09-11

French history pre-dates the English settlements in colonial America. It's called \\"The French Fact\\".  Thousands of French-Canadians can trace their family genealogies to the 1640s and even earlier. Many families even, rather easily, find their first ancestor's roots in medieval France because the history of the culture is so meticulously preserved through the accuracy of the Roman Catholic Church's directories of baptisms, marriages and deaths. Nevertheless, few Americans learn about French-Canadian culture.  So, it's about time the descendents of French-Canadians tell their interesting and special stories.  Thankfully, many French-Canadian families living in New England are telling their family stories; but now we learn the French-Canadian history and culture is proudly shared by others living in Michigan.  Thanks to the research by John P. DuLong, a third generation French-Canadian whose family settled into the Michigan area, the stories of America's French-Canadians are literally tied together - Michigan's French-Americans are culturally similar to New England's \\"Franco-Americans\\".  Moreover, it's not a parochial or regional history anymore. DuLong's history of Michigan's French-Canadians is a story New England's Franco-Americans will relate to. There's vintage photographs and even a tourtiere recipe (traditional pork pie, an icon of the French-Canadian culture). Furthermore, all French-Americans of Canadian descent will enjoy a well deserved sense of pride in reading French-Canadians in Michigan. As a side comment, it seems the writing of French history in North American suffered sort of an arrested state of development after Francis Parkman published his series in the late 1800s about the French in North America. A lot has happened since Parkman wrote his chronicles, largely transcribed from the Jesuit Relations documents written by Frenchmissionaries.  DuLong's work on French-Canadians in Michigan might stir more interest in French-Canadian history. For the sake of a culture older than Plymouth, in Massachusetts, we need more of DuLong's writing to preserve the dwindling numbers of living memories of French-Canadians in America.	2004-08-14

In fact, \\"practice\\" is the operational word in describing what makes for a \\"good\\" surgeon - and Dr. Atul Gawande describes how the surgeon needs plenty of opportunities to wield the scalpel before he or she feels as competent as they look when they use one. \\"Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science\\" by Atul Gawande is a personal collection of spell binding first person medical stories. Gawands presents the reader with a physician who's as creative with prose as he appears to be with surgical sutures. Gawande is a frequent contributor to The New Yorker Magazine. Usually retrospective physicians in a reading group I participate in were unusually animated about \\"Complications\\" and validated some of Gawande's stories with similar versions of their own.  <BR>\\"Complications\\" is not a medical \\"who-done-it\\"; nor is it a non-fiction version of the popular television show \\"ER\\".  It's about one surgeon's practice, but the stories are, to a certain extent, similar to the shared experiences of all physicians, regardless of their specialty. A surgeon must have a good medical education, lots of practice doing procedures that develop proficient skills and a fair amount of good luck.<BR>Sometimes surgery helps patients to physically recover but the psychological side effects cannot be measured as easily as physiologic symptoms. One essay brings that point home titled, \\"Crimson Tide\\", about a girl who seeks a surgical cure for uncontrollable blushing. In this case, the patient felt her spontaneous blushing was holding her back as a television news anchor because it affected her job performance. After her successful surgery obtained in Scandinavia, she discovered she was self conscious about having it done in the first place, even though it cured her blushing! Essays in \\"Complications\\" begin with real people, identities protected, who somehow, either positively or not, are affected by medical treatment.

Brennan creates a fictional town named Millbank, Mass., where French and Irish families live in distinctly different cultures and sheltered neighborhoods. Of course, the novel's location could be any one of New England's industrial communities.<BR>\\"Au Revoir, L'Acadie\\" is a hard hitting story your grandfather might tell you if he worked in the mills. Nevertheless, it's a tough memoir to transcribe into nostalgic Irish and French-Canadian heritages. Reading Brennan's \\"take no prisoners\\" style prose helps us not to forget the difficult lives led by the tens of thousands of men and women workers who endured 10 hours a day laboring in the now vacant mill buildings. <BR>\\"We were ready to die, or murder to get away from the stupid mill....It's no life...,\\" says a lead character Evelyn LaBonte.<BR>The formidable mill structures are still evident in Maine communities like Sanford, Biddeford, Waterville, Westbrook and others. Franco-Americans comprised a huge percentage of the New England mill workforce during the 1930s. Irish immigrants preceded the French-Canadian workers. Eventually, the two different ethnic groups, united by Roman Catholicism but separated by their French and English languages, were competing for jobs and power in New England's 1930s labor movements.  <BR>\\"Au Revoir, L'Acadie\\", takes place during The Great Depressions, when Irish labor leaders tried to unite the French-Canadian workers with them into a union because the mills were failing and they worried about loosing their jobs.   <BR>Brennan reveals unflattering examples about the Irish clergy, who dominated Roman Catholic parishes in New England, and who engaged in efforts to undermine French and Irish cooperation during the tumultuous labor organizational efforts.  <BR>Few words are wasted in describing the covert methods used by the Irish clergy to influence efforts against the French-Canadians in the mills.  One character, Father Gerrity, is potrayed as an influential anti-French cleric who stereotypes French Canadians as \\"untrustworthy\\" because they threaten Irish prestige with the mill owners.  Even the extraordinary act of excommunication, or prohitibitiong Roman Catholics from receiving the Sacraments, was threatened by the clergy as punishment for those who helped the union's collaborations.<BR>\\"Au Revoir, L'Acadie\\" provides a rare opportunity for frank discussion about the ethnic strife and prejudices between two competing ethnic groups during a time in the 19th century when both sides had much to gain and loose from the outcomes of their collective actions.  <BR>I recommend the novel for sociology students, particularly, for Elder Hostel programs where some of the senior students were likely involved in the very history Brennan describes.  Check the website: [...] for more information.<BR>Brennan is a talented story teller who puts his strong characters up close and personal with the reader.  He was inspired to write \\"Au Revoir, L'Acadie\\" after visiting to the Museum of Work & Culture in Woonsocket, RI, an exhibit depicting the daily life of Franco-American mill workers.<BR>An interesting non-fiction companion to read along with \\"Au Revoir, L'Acadie\\" is \\"The Belles of New England\\", by Scarborough resident William Moran.	2004-03-20

After much discussion about Dan Brown's hot bestselling novel, I'd like to add some summary statements based upon having read the book.  There's no point in being verbose about this. Yes, I enjoyed the book with reservations. Here are my observations - by Juliana L'Heureux:<br />1.  The Da Vinci Code is an entertaining murder mystery.<br />2.  It's a novel; therefore, it's fiction.<br />3.  Dan Brown is a clever novelist so there's several unexpected twists to the plot, almost all the intrigue stretches to pass the &quot;straight face test&quot; (clever, nonetheless). 4.  Although Dan Brown claims the art history, etc. described is based upon his FACT, he doesn't explain why the paradoxes in The Da Vinci Code were never exposed by the Protestant Reformation.<br />Surely, some people at this point may have made up their mind about The Da Vinci code based upon the reviews and spin off discussions about the book, but without reading it for themselves. Almost everyone who reads The Da Vinci Code enjoys the story. For skeptics who feel the book is<br />(a) too hyped or (2) too heavily weighted towards the sacred feminine- I'd say, &quot;lighten up&quot; and read it for the story value; or- just wait for the movie to be released.	2004-01-18

Just try it, if you dare.  Maine politics are the matrix for most of Christian Potholm's work but the tactics he employs are effective regardless of where the issues call for his special brand of punditry and political strategy. In other words, anywhere where there's politics at stake. I sometimes think of Christian Potholm as the alter ego of James Carvell.  Anyone who wants to take on a political campaign against Chris Potholm had better read &quot;Just Do It&quot; or they're doomed to fail.  Better know thy enemy, or better yet, thy friend - because there's probably no better friend to Maine politics than Christian Potholm.  &quot;Just Do It&quot; is a political journal of ins, outs, twists and foils based upon actual campaigns where one or two incidents of fate either made or sunk an election or citizens iniative (referendum).  It's like reading a primer on running political campaigns.  Some cynics might think of &quot;Just Do It&quot; as a &quot;Believe it or Not&quot; anthology.  Speaking candidly as someone who's worked alongside Christian Potholm on several political iniatives, &quot;Just Do It&quot; is the perfect title for this political primer.  Cynics can lick their wounds after the dust of a failed campaign settles. Those smart enough to &quot;Just Do It&quot; have the edge of understanding how to strategically communicate with the voter and win political campaigns.	2003-11-15

Moogk, 60, a Canadian professor currently living in Vancouver, British Columbia, brought out a surprisingly non-traditional point of view on Franco-American culture.  <br />So much of Franco-American culture is embellished in nostalgia about the past, but Moogk cuts through the heroic veneer presented by some earlier writers like Francis Parkman.<br />Moogk's most recent book was published in the United States in 2001, titled \\"La Nouvelle France: The Making of French Canada- A Cultural History\\".   It's an ambitious historical effort.<br />To his credit, Moogk provides extensive research covering the entire 400 year scope of the French experience in North America, not just a little slice of it.  In a nutshell, Moogk avoids all prevailing points of view about French-Canadian culture. There's no embellishments or cultural nostalgia.  <br />Instead, Moogk's research drives home the difficult circumstances of French history in North America. <BR> <BR>Moogk teaches early French North American history at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.  He's a citizen of both England and Canada.  He's not a French-Canadian but he attended McGill University in Montreal for a brief time and he speaks French.<br />One reason he wrote La Nouvelle France was because he wasn't happy with what his students were learning about French-Canada.  Popular Canadian histories assume that New France has no influence upon the present.  The French Regime is presented as colorful but not serious. It's a sequential era of heroic missionaries, valiant warriors, explorers and hardy fur traders.  <br />But the French-Canadian culture is more complex and impressive than what's currently portrayed, he says.<br />Not surprising, La Nouvelle France generated some criticism from French-Canadian history reviewers, he says.  <br />\\"Reviewers are critical of my analysis of the French separatist movement in the last chapter,\\" he says.  In fact, reviewers prefer talking about the last chapter and thereby tend to dismiss the exhaustive historic research throughout the rest of the text, he says.  <br />From a Franco-American point of view, the second chapter is most interesting. Moogk describes the special relationship during the colonial period between the French and Aboriginal people (i.e., Native Americans).  In Canada, the Native Americans are now called \\"First Nations\\".  <br />In French, the original common word for First Nations was les Sauvages, meaning \\"Wild People of the Forests\\".  <br />\\"The word `Sauvages' was an old interpretation and wasn't a hostile word during the 17th and 18th centuries,\\" says Moogk.  <br />\\"I observed a healthy relationship between the French colonists and the Aboriginal peoples,\\" says Moogk.  \\"The nature of the relationship couldn't be ignored,\\" he says. Moreover, the special relationship was learned from  European attitudes towards primitive people.  Colonial French settlers accepted Aboriginal people, says Moogk, because the European aristocracy readers of Greek, and Roman classics and the Holy Bible believed in a lost world of innocence, like the Biblical Eden.  <br />Colonial era Europeans believed les Sauvages lived a romanticized life in a golden and mythical world free to do as they pleased. They were supposedly relieved from the necessity of labor because they were surrounded by abundant food.  <br />To 17th century Europeans, the Amerindians confirmed the classic beliefs that primitive people lost their innocence when they were corrupted by luxury and artificiality.  <br />\\"I was struck by the number of stories about French children who were raised by the native people.  It's nearly impossible to track, but the sprinkling of French children in the native culture is interesting\\", he says. <br />On a positive note, Moogk likes the compassionate nature of the French culture and the strong family ties. <br />La Nouvelle France is certainly a different perspective on the culture, sure to stir debate, as well it should.

French Canadian women are probably at the very end of a long line of feminist ethnic groups frequently overlooked for the formidable standard they set, later a prototype characterized by Rosie the Riveter during America's darkest days during the middle of the last century.  The Belles of New England is a well researched history about the development of New England's dinosaur textile and shoe industries and how hard working immigrant women made moguls of their owners.  Although the Franco-American woman were a large workforce in these now largely empty brick buildings, hopelessly stuck on the landscape of New England towns, they weren't the only ones to contribute to the industrial age success of these mega-industries.  Still, Franco-American women were unusual. Largely from Quebec, they raised extraordinarily large families while working labor jobs to raise money for their extended families. Franco-Americans are different than other American ethnic melting pot varieties in that they could always go home again, to Canada, by train or by foot. But, they stayed, raised their families and contributed to the wealth of a few industrialists who probably never said thank you.  So, author Bill Moran has said in &quot;Belles&quot; what the moguls couldn't even conceptualize if their lives depended on it to do so.  Nice selection of historic photos, too.  Moran gives long overdue credit to the women who helped make New England prosperous.	2003-06-14

I absolutely loved Rosayln Carter's &quot;First Lady From Plains&quot;.  I've read books about Martha Washington, Dolly Madison, Rachel Jackson, Mary Todd Lincoln and Eleanor Roosevelt.  So, now I've read a fascinating autobiography by Mrs. Clinton.  Everybody has an opinion about Senator Hilary Clinton.  Who hasn't talked about her? Admit it! So, now the Senator from New York wants to give us more information, only, from her side of the story.  &quot;It must be political&quot;, critics say. So what? She tells a terrific story.  Most books share pleasant surprises with readers, or should, if they're good reads  &quot;Living History&quot; is a surprise by how simply it's written- like, from the point of view of an average person given the same set of circumstances experienced by Mrs. Clinton during her husband's tumultuous but prosperous White House Years.  Even more enjoyable are the warm and fuzzy photos of Mrs. Clinton's family, her childhood and beautiful photos of her more loving moments with her husband, President Clinton.  She obviously loved her husband; she might still love him. Her story is a quick read, a splendid account of history told with emotion and, sure, it's also a timely publication.  If people talked about you or me to the extraordinary and compulsive extent that they appear to dwell on Mrs. Clinton, well, hey! wouldn't we be feeling entitled to our own say, in response?  Well, &quot;Living History&quot; tells her side with style. Moreover, Mrs. Clinton lived her history with dignity, grace and, ultimately, became victorious over her political adversaries.  But, there's not one hint of smugness in &quot;Living History&quot;.  It's a book worthy of the extraordinary publicity it's generating. Regardless of how we perceive our former First Lady and Senator from New York, she's entitled to this moment in the literary limelight.	2003-06-12

What a clever way to tell fans and the otherwise curious about how a very poor young man who went to school in tiny Pownal, Maine and who later worked as a janitor for nearby Brunswick High School became a world famous super-writer. Among all the reviews I've read about Stephen King's very candid account of the writing craft, I'm still looking for one that tells the truth about the story itself. I am so very impressed by how King is able to paint his life as a Mainer (he passes the test, being born in the state) and transmit the colorful pictures of people and places in exactly the way they really are. Other than the love King expresses for his wife and family, there's no romanticism in \\"On Writing\\". Still, in the absence of any embellishment, King writes a wonderful and inspiring story for everyone who either wants to be a writer or who wonders what stuff the crafters are made of. Kudos to the University of Maine where King's writing talent was validated by the English Department professors.  There's a parallel story in \\"On Writing\\". Indeed, the book's title is hyphenated, \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft\\", because this is an autobiographical way of saying what seems right, or not so right, about writing. Thankfully, it's a lovely read and not at all self gratifying or congratulatory in any way. As a matter of fact, the story King tells ends with a chilling rendition about his tragic accident while walking along the road in Western Maine. King doesn't take a minute to indulge in self pity, despite having a very close brush with death as a result of the accident. There's a rhetorical question raised, of course, about how we would have known about those rats in the cellars of the mills in Lisbon Falls or those tampons in the girl's gym in Brunswick High School and how these experiences inspired \\"Carrie\\" and other horror tales. If King had not been spared and survived his tragedy, we would not have the joy of knowing what it's like to live inside the mind of a creative writing genius. Thanks so much, Stephen King, for \\"On Writing\\". It's a book everyone can read to appreciate your creativity and the deep respect you obviously hold for the craft of being a hard working writer.	2003-04-28

As author Brother Rick Curry, S.J., says, &quot;I'm reminded of the simplicity...A little flour and water and some other wholeseome ingredients make an infinte number of breads&quot;.  <BR>&quot;The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking&quot; is a delightful collection of spiritual stories and easy to understand bread recipes.  Building on the mystique of the Jesuit religious order, Brother Curry kneads the spirtual life and writings of the order's founder Saint Ignatius Loyola into the recipe collection.  Indeed, this colection might be particularly interesting for those curious to know more about the Jesuits without having to read a long historical account.  At first, I was leary of the large number bread recipes presented because my success with breadmaking was non-existent. I thought, &quot;Why should I buy a book about breadmaking when I've never been able to get the dough to the first rise&quot;? Nevertheless, I wanted to try Brother Curry's recipe for Irish Soda Bread, cooked without yeast, so I purchased the book.  Of course, I could have simply copied the recipe without buying the book, but my religious side thought  this was being disingenuous. Now, I'm so glad I made the investment because reading the recipes is just as much fun as baking them.  Many recipes do not require using yeast, a relief for my breakmaking anxiety.  As I tired several different recipes, I became more confident to try at least one yeast recipe. Finally, voila, like a miracle, I actually make O'Brien's Oatmeal Bread!  Obviously, I'm now a convert to Brother Curry's recipes and, of course, I intend to try several more recipes as my breakmaking skills are tested.  I already have several handwritten notes in the margins of this book documenting my own experiences with the recipes. Thank you Brother Curry and and also to Brother John O'Brien, who was a &quot;vigorous&quot; teacher of Latin at Gonzaga Prep in Spokane Washington when Curry met him and learned his namesake Oatmeal Bread recipe. This is a good book for those needing to develop more faith in their breadmaking ability.  If you are already an expert breadmaker, Curry's collection is likely to sharpen the spiritual side of your God given talents.	2003-02-05

Michael Dubruiel presents a varied bouquet of daily devotions ranging from traditional to modern petitions. Most interesting are the addresses provided for the North American shrines where the particular saints or religious orders supporting the special novenas are located. For example, I'm delighted to learn the meditations in honor of Saint Maximillan Kolbe and to learn where his shrine is located in Libertyville, Il. Traditional meditations to the Miraculous Medal are nostalgic for those who remember those continuous novenas during pre-Vatican II.  Updated novenas to the French North American Martyrs and Native American Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha bring some interesting diversity to the collection as well.  \\"Mention Your Request Here\\" is a delightful instructional about how to improve daily communications with God rather than a \\"novena book\\", or a ritualistic series of petitions asking for saintly favors. Indeed, Saint Theresa, the \\"little flower\\" is, quite likely, very well pleased with Dubruiel's impressive prayer collection, which, of course, includes her special devotion.	2003-01-15

Abraham Verghese is dark skinned, could be a native of a third world country's medical school or a graduate of an American off shore medical school where medical students are recruited and trained to help fill staff shortages in American hospitals. Except, the surprise in this beautifully written autobiographical medical story is the, oftentimes, experimental science lesson behind the medicine.  Verghese is as well trained in his medical style as any American phyician, (he is Indian) with the emphasis being on &quot;training&quot;.  It seems like Verghese spends most of his professional career training for his next medical puzzlement.  Thankfully, at least according to Verghese's account, medical practitioners attempt to be oblivious about their race or most other humanly distinctive features because the science of the profession overrides their quest to cure. Describing his life in almost parellel segments, Verghese seems to compartmentalize his family from his professional self in the style of the 24 hour medical man with Johns Hopkins or Bellevue credentials.  In &quot;My Own Country&quot;, Verghese eventually seems to finds peace between his ethnicity, nationality and his professional demeanor in the unlikely location of the Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee, the town of Johnson City, where he works as Chief of the Medical Staff at the Veterans Administration Hospital.  As a side practice, however, he becomes involved with the early history, diagnosis and attempts to treat Human Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV) and Acquired Immune Defficiency Syndrom (AIDS).  As a result of Verghese's professional compulsion to undertand the science behind the treatments he prescribes, he continues to run afoul of his personal life and risks the alienation of his nuclear ethnic Indian family.  &quot;My Own Country&quot; is clearly the story of a self made medical hero, told in his own words.  Those who want their personal physicians to be holistic healers and more in touch with their humanity may disagree with Verghese's approach to his profession. Indeed, one wonders how much of the medical text was toned down to make the book appealing to the trade paperback market. Regardless of how medical the &quot;doctor-doctor&quot; in Verghese is, he is still human enough to be emotionally riveted by the birth of his children, at least for a little while.  Perhaps the best thing about reading &quot;My Own Country&quot; is the professional manner presented for thrid world country physicians who are as dedicated (or more) to healing as any, but defensive about skin color in America. In other words, identifying good, even great, physicians, should be a color blind process.  Besides making a positive social statement, even in the face of personal sacrifice, Verghese writes a good story.  &quot;My Own Country&quot; is entertaining and there's a lesson to be learned for everyone in the reading.	2002-09-03

Studying the professional career of the English heroine Florence Nightingale is mandatory in just about every accredited school of nursing because, after all, she gave respectability to her profession. Even Nightingale's mother would faint at the thought of her daughter being a \\"nurse\\", because respectable ladies in Victorian England just didn't do such things.  Thankfully, Florence broke with her culture and created, what some would call, a new paradigm for women.  Now, that's the way Florence Nightingale is presented to nursing students, but it's not the way author Hugh Small presents his argument in \\"Florence Nightingale: Avenging Angel\\".  Well, of course, somebody had to break the myth of Florence Nightingale.  As an icon of Victorian culture and style, Nightingale had to be taken down a peg or two.  Never mind, the memorial to Nightingale located in the middle of a group of stuffy old coffins in the crypts in London's St. Paul's Cathedral. Never mind, the enormous statue honoring Nightingale and the memorial to the Crimea, nearly causing traffic jams at the intersection where it is boldly located in downtown London.  Never mind, the Nightingale Museum and its life sized display of three demensional shadow boxes located adjacent to St. Thomas Hospital in London.  If the real Nightingale would please stand up, as Hugh Small describes her in his biography, the lady's myth would be on trail right now for genocide, having caused the deaths of thousands of British soilders in the 1856 Crimean War.  The biographer Small, of course, anticipated just such a visceral reaction from Nightingale's cult, mostly nurses like myself, so he floods the book with lengthy documentation and footnotes to counter any dispute about the authenticity of his Nightingale research. In summary, if history addicts want to know about remote letters from people as memorable as Lord Palmerston and details of the NcNeill-Tulloch reports to Parliment about the Nightingale hospital, then, this book is definitely made to order.  Of course, it's admirable to have a counter-cultural history published every 100 years or so about our sacred myths and legends. Hugh Small certainly deliveres a counter-cultural point of view, so for this I give him a nod of approval.  Nevertheless, I didn't like reading \\"Avenging Angel\\", bcause the biographjy, I believe, belies the premise if its cover.  Small sets the reader up for one expectation about the heroine Nightingale while actually undermining the reader's trust with absolutely mind startling information.  So, I guess somebody had to eventually re-invent Nightingale.  Too bad, the story is 150 years after the fact.  Perhaps the best part of reading \\"Florence Nightingale: Avenging Angel\\" is the reinforcement it provides to holistic healers and health care skeptics who instinctively seem to know that staying away from hospitals is better for your health and life longevity than relying on the curative treatment that may never come. Rating this book was difficult, but for historical data it gets a 5; for story value it gets a 1....\\"Data 5, Book 1\\"....so, I think a rating of 2 is fair.	2002-09-02

Yet, even with some personal exposure, it's amazing how much of the idealism and cynicism, evident in modern physician practice, Lewis portrays in his 1926 pulitizer prize winning book, &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;.  Martin Arrowsmith, M.D. is a fictional idealist who is a human being before all else, but trying to bring science to the practice of Medicine. Actually, the story seems almost autobiographical due to the personal intensity and human fraility of the complex main character. As a registered nurse, reading Arrowsmith brings flashbacks of the past, like the cliches &quot;deja vu all over again&quot;, or worse, &quot;the more things change, the more they stay the same&quot;.  Medicine for financial- profit, patient care challenges, personality conflicts, political shenanigans, professional competition, and overutilization of medical technology are some of the common problems Arrowsmith faces as he pursues a career in medicine after barely struggling through the politics of medical school in the mythical town of Wheatsylvania, Midwest, USA, in the early 20th century.  This is not another novel about how physicians affect people's lives, but a masterpiece about the nuances of the medical profession as mysterious and suspect,of physicians who are heros and villans. Most surprising are the humerous vignettes sprinkled throughout the plot like bits and pieces of old Jack Benny radio show skits.  When Martin Arrowsmith must decide if he is to fulfill his promise to marry Madeline Fox or betray her for his soul mate Leora Tozer, the genious writer Lewis creates such humor in the ensuing restaurant scene, that should be frought with melodrama, but, instead, is absolutely delightful reading.  Similar humor engulfs the life portrayed of Arrowsmith's employer, Pickerbaugh, and his fleet of daughters named after flowers, like the saucy Orchid.  Arrowsmith is simply a joy to read, especially for people who have a flair for some classic literature without getting too deep into concentrated philosophic thought.  Simply put, Arrowsmith today, were he to practice in modern medicine, would probably be no better or worse off than he was in 1908 through circa 1920, when the novel takes place.  Arrowsmith is a classic American novel and an entertaining story.wsmith is simply a joy to read, especially for people who have a flair for some classic literature without getting too deep into concentrated philosophic thought.

Of course, the apparations receiving the  most favorable publicity are Guadalupe, Mexico; Fatima, Portugal; and Lourdes, France.  &quot;God Sent&quot; is a book that lives up to its title.  It's actually &quot;God Sent&quot; to read about the miraculous Marian apparitions in the context of the history of Christianity (especially in the Roman Catholic tradition, but not exclusively) and to also realize how the Marian phenomena are universal, even more prevelent than reported by the mainstream Roman Catholic media.  My faith has been positively affected by reading &quot;God Sent&quot;. I sincerely want to thank the author, Roy Abraham Varghese for taking the time to write such an eloquent history about The Blessed Virgin Mary and her frequent calls to humanity for prayer, peace and penance. Varghese writes about the Marian apparitions almost as though he personally witnessed them. Moreover, he explains the messages in ordinary language. My husband and I traveled to Lourdes, France, after reading &quot;God Sent&quot; and the spiritual experience of being in this special shrine located in the French Pyrennes Mountains was more meaningful when understood in the context of nearly all Marian apparitions documented since the first century. Frankly, I wish &quot;God Sent&quot; was more readily available in bookstores.  As a thorough history of Marian devotions, &quot;God Sent&quot; deserves to be a best selling book if, for no other reason, than to help ordinary readers appreciate Varghese's extraordinary research into the important history of Marian devotions in Roman Catholic spirituality.	2002-08-24

Once the story's protagonist falls under the permanent control of her physician husband, her life becomes one obsessive-compulsive act after another until the climax.  Post partum depression is the primary diagnosis presented in this rapidly moving plot.  Perhaps this gem of a story would be better reviewed as medical literature and made required reading- it's short, after all- for students and professors who study physician-patient communications.	2002-08-19

Books	5	7	8	N	N	Essential reference about New England's French Minority	There are literally millions of Americans who claim some French heritage in their ancestry, due in large part to the proliferation of the French Canadians who migrated to the U.S. from Quebec and the Canadian Maritime Provences. America's Industrial Revolution stirred the overwhelming bulk of these migrants to seek work in New England textile mills and factories while a terrible depression was riveting their Canadian homeland. Although bits and pieces of the rich French history in North American are available in scores of mostly out of print books and academic literature, \\"Steeples and Smokestackes\\" is the only currently available, or at least, most recently published, English language anthology on a specific group called \\"Franco-Americans\\". Author Claire Quintal has dedicated most of her academic career in study of this very proud ethnic group that are responsible for sustaining the industrial infrastructure of New England since before the time of the American Civil War, during World War I and through World War II. The Franco-American culture is special by its history, language and strong dedication to Roman Catholicism even in the face of harsh discrimination from New England's staunch Protestant hierarchy. Besides all of the above, \\"Steeples and Smokestacks\\" is a very good read, enjoyable, to the point and, speaking from a cultural point of view, \\"C'est un tres bon livre\\".	2002-08-15

In fact, great places are the focus of his Art History Mystieries series, like Paris, London, Rome, and lots more of Rome, Los Angeles and other five star places like that. As far as the murder mystery in each book's plot, like \\"The Titian Committee\\", the story is as much about Venice (place) and how this high brow Titian committee credentials master works than it is about the dead body discovered in the first chapter. Reading a Pears novel is<BR>worth challenging a few college credits in art history, only tons more fun.  Still, even with the \\"opposites attract\\" characters of the often morose Jonathon Argyle, who lives up to his very predictable last name, and his risk taking love Gloria Di Stafano, \\"The Titian Committee\\" isn't quite as memorable as the other books in this effervecent mystery series. Sometimes, the plot becomes just too cumbersome to make sense. Nevertheless, I wouldn't want to miss reading it, if only to keep up with the lively antics of the hero and heroine- especially, to find out if they ever plan on taking their relationship beyond the Panda bear dance they play out in their comic/drama experiences.  Overall, \\"The Titian Committee\\" does not stand alone in The Art History Mysteries, but it's a good link with the others.  \\"The Raphael Affair\\" is still the best in the series with \\"Death and Restoration\\" a close second. Of course, it will likely be a long time before another book will compare with the intellectual stimulation of \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\", a first rate Pears mystery, but not in the line up of the Art History Mysteries series.	2002-03-27
