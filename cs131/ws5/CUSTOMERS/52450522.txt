Reading the reviews on Amazon.com about \\"The Third Eye\\" I wonder if many of them were written by the same person.  I am suspicious. <br /> <br />\\"The Third Eye\\" is mildly entertaining, but if it is not true, then it does affect my perception of it.  I am sorry.  I could have written as good a book, since I have read lots about Tibet, but not been there in this body. <br /> <br />The theology chapter \\"Tibetan Beliefs\\" is patently ludicrous.  I know enough about Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhism, to spot this as a quaint concoction by a Christian (or formerly Christian) Westerner.  I was also offended by the forceful assertion that there *IS* a GOD (italics his), and that it doesn't matter what we call Him.  God is a fact.  Smells pretty fishy to me. <br /> <br />Then he \\"explains\\" what Om Mani Padme Hum means.   \\"Hail to Man's Overself!\\"  WHAAAATT???  Is that Nietzsche or who?   <br /> <br />I was not impressed by the advice in the book on how to relax.  Imagine falling off a cliff and laying there all sprawled and lack-jawed from your SPLAT onto the Earth.  Come on!   <br /> <br />This is pure fiction and not even good fiction.	2005-08-03

I had a hard time sounding out the Arab names and words and wished there had been some sort of a pronunciation key.  But the content was admirable and the writing very clear and crisp.<br /><br />Mr. Aslan's interpretation of events in light on modern events was very apropos and usually quite good, though I felt the last chapter rambled on and on and could have been tightened by shortening.  That was the only weak part of the book.  It seemed like a ranting sermon.<br /><br />I appreciated the fact that Aslan is a sincere Muslim himself and holds the Prophet and God in highest honor.  That's nice.<br /><br />One thing puzzled me, and Mr. Aslan might want to put out a 2nd edition soon to fix this, is the state of democratic reforms in Qatar and a few other progressive Muslim nations.  Also, I wonder how the author feels about the new President of Iran?  It seems as though Iran is taking a step backwards, though the picture is muddied.  For instance, this new guy, though he holds troubling links to the 1979 hostage situation, is a friend of the poor in Iran whereas Khatami, a moderate and almost secular in his government-church-separation ideas, was stinking rich and never fixed the poor's plight.  Sigh.  What a broken record for the Muslim world!<br /><br />All very interesting!<br /><br />If you want to really understand the sects of Islam, like Sufis, Shi'ites, Karijites, etc.  Mr. Aslan's book is EXCELLENT!  Also, he does a very clear job of delineating the philosophical and theological problems in Islam.  I felt so, at least, knowing a fair amount about religious philosophy.  I felt he researched his stuff well, since I checked some of his facts and stuff.  It all looked correct.	2005-07-02

He occasionally rises to descriptive eloquence, and he very occasionally tries to describe ancient cooking and housekeeping methods, like Jean Auel does (but much better).  But the overriding thing that I hate about Sarabande is the unrelenting blood!  Horrific killings, sacrifices of virgins, tortures, delayed deaths, yuck.  I know that some Native Americans practiced horrific killings (I hated \\"Dances with Wolves\\" too!)  But this is not entertainment for me.  It is horror, like watching Gremlins or reading a Stephen King novel.  I also felt that the religious themes of this novel were too advanced, too close to what we know, to sound authentic.  For example, Ysuna will gain life everlasting if she eats of the white mammoth.  Is this something that true Native Americans believed?  I don't know.  It just sounded suspiciously like Western thought (or Middle Eastern blood atonement religions.) <br /> <br />I read this book because I liked a previous one where Navakh was almost a real character, and even his moment of death was described quite interestingly.  But even that novel was real bloody.  I shouldn't have thought Sarabande would change.  Sorry.	2005-05-30

Overall, a fascinating book from which I learned a great deal!  It was chock full of info about Julian the Apostate and Arius and made me want to learn and read more. <br /> <br />Beware, though.  This author seems slanted against orthodox Christianity, which is not necessarily bad.  It is just that it isn't a balanced view.  The book gives the impression that Orthodox Christians were all a bunch or murderous nutcases. <br /> <br />One question I have... whence came the culture of Mary worship and saint worship, that is so much a part of the Catholic church today?  It seems like polytheism inserted itself cleverly into the fabric of the RC church.  Another fascinating thing is the fact that worship of the Blessed Virgin Mary and her possible elevation to Co-redemptress threatens the concept of the Trinity enormously. <br /> <br />But overall a very worthwhile read!!!	2005-03-29

If only books like this were available in 1978 when I took statistics!  Recently I looked at my college textbook.  What a horrible yawn it is!!  Yuck!  These \\"Complete Idiots Guides\\" are really excellent because they are not so huge and overwhelming, yet they have the mainstream stuff that most of us need.<br /><br />The humor helps, too, and the author's website has cute pictures of his family members, who figure into the book's examples.  It is surprising how much a picture helps!<br /><br />I've worked through almost the whole book and it was really just what I needed.  My only suggestion (outside of a few<br /><br />typo fixes) is to provide more exercises, possibly with only<br /><br />the answers, not the whole worked-out solutions.  Keep the<br /><br />worked-out problems that are there, though!  There is nothing<br /><br />that firms up one's knowledge better than doing problems, and<br /><br />seeing the correct answers.<br /><br />So I recommend this book both to college students who are suffering, as well as to busy professionals who need a refresher and can't devote hundreds of hours.	2005-01-25

Eric Swanson's humorous, poignant view of Tibet is rife with memorable visions. At times I burst out laughing and read passages to my companions on the bus. But the book is more than just a travelogue throught the dirt and grime of Tibetan poverty. It is about spiritual thirst and quest. Though this book is not as long or didactic as others (&quot;3 Years in Tibet&quot; or Alexandra David-Neels' works), I found it superb and will keep it and read it again. I didn't think that Eric was on an ego-trip!!! Jeez! Some reviewers are so strange! The ending was very touching, I thought. I especially liked the story of the envelope containing the strands of hair from past beings, including Eric's own head... the whisker of a dead cat... That kind of stuff always makes the old tears flow, which is good. So enjoy this sparkling little gem of a book! And enjoy your Western shower and deodorant!	2004-07-28

She deserves so much for this splendid book.<br />Her insights into the spirituality of food, even simple things like wrapping packages carefully like the Japanese do, make it a book that you can apply to your daily life, even if you never attend a tea ceremony.<br />My *ONLY* gripe, and I really hate to say this, is that her connection with Zen Buddhism was tenuous.  She does go to Mount Hiei toward the end of the book and tries to sit with the monks, but she spends a lot more time talking about recipes again.  But really that's okay because her main emphasis is not to meditate until satori, but to appreciate the food connection.<br />I can't think of anyone who would not fall in love with this book!

Surprised by the negative comments about its length, I found almost everything very helpful and not too redundant.  The author's clear explication of Buddhist theory and practice was truly an excellent addition to the book.<br />I was troubled a tiny tiny bit by her anthropomorphizing of schemas, as if they were evil beasts dwelling within us and pulling our strings.

I thought this was a superb example of \\"living Zen,\\" the kind of Zen book that is half didactic and half personal autobiography.  Anne Rudloe invites us into her home to see her struggle with her 90-year-old, cranky grandmother and her sons (named Cypress and Sky).  I thought Ms. Rudloe did a superb job of showing us how difficult it is to apply Zen practice when our nearest and dearest drive us insane.  But her moments with her sons outdoors watching deer or the stars or the sunset were magical.  I thought the pivotal center point of the book was on p. 80 where she describes having just listened to \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" with her boys while watching a heron.  She concludes:  \\"In that moonlight, in that moment, Zen, the finger that points to the moon, was nonexistent.\\"  Wow.<br />I loved the book and appreciated the many words of wisdom and teaching that Ms. Rudloe graced us with.  My only teensy complaint is that towards the end of the book, she spent too much time lecturing at us, and not enough time injecting that personal, human, story-telling touch.  I think she had so much to say about Zen that she sacrificed our attention span for her goal of getting it all said.  I really hate to be critical in any way whatsoever, but might I suggest that if she had taken her own words about Zen disappearing, she might have given us the chance to figure it out for ourselves by yet another story or angle on her life.  Too many words muddy the waters.<br />But overall, a superb book!!!!	2002-10-26

But it isn't.  Dr. Baker leads us through the plausible mechanisms of how a language changes and it was truly the most exciting part of the book.  I never thought before that mere variations in style could be the engine that drives linguistic change.  Fascinating!<br />One tiny thing Dr. Baker didn't talk about was the reason why English speakers can understand German word order.  Is it because (I believe) we have vestigial understanding apparatus of German word order due to English's ancestry.  I love the Germanic word order in a plaque that is in Buffalo here, \\"Here died McKinley.\\"<br />What I refered to was why can we understand \\"Yesterday have I your mother seen.\\" or \\"She said that Tom had her the book given.\\"  It is not completely incomprehensible, almost fun!<br />Anyway, thank you Dr. Baker!	2002-06-24

I really loved this book, and am dismayed by those who decry it.  Come on!  McWhorter's writing is excellent and challenging.  What do some people expect?  Sentences that are three words long?  I liked his ideas, I liked his exposition, I liked his cute little anecdotes, side-stories, and witty observations.  I even loved his chapter titles and subtitles.<br />He confirms what I've long suspected, that a lot of this \\"garbage\\" (which he calls \\"dammits\\") that we have to learn in many language such as Latin and German are mere bells and whistles, senseless accretions that do not help communication.  McWhorter's use of creoles and pidgins to make his points, all the way up to the very end with his speculations on the very first language, were thrilling!  I learned so much that I never got elsewhere.<br />Moreover, McWhorter doesn't rely on English too much, though he doesn't completely ignore it, either.  It is fun to be challenged to go outside of our own language, even outside the Indo-European family, in order to learn linguistic points.  Bravo!<br />Now I must say that I found one interesting mistake.  On page 186 he gives the gender of the German eating utensils incorrectly.  It is \\"die Gabel,\\" \\"der Loeffel,\\" not the other way around.  Much later he gets Gabel correct (p. 229).  No big deal.  In fact, I thought maybe he was trying to make a point of the mistake by saying, \\"See how senseless genders really are?\\"  Oh well.  I didn't find any other mistakes though I only know Indo-European stuff, and have no clue about Native American languages or Chinese or elsewhere.<br />But this was a fabulous book that I intend to read again and maybe a third time.  Thank you, Professor McWhorter!!!	2002-05-27

You will learn a lot of tender-loving Buddhism by reading this book.  <br />One fascinating new thing (for me) was the theory of the Axial Age, which is between 800 and 300 BCE when at least 3 major centers of human civilization saw the rise of a new style of religion.<br />Feminists should really appreciate this book, which spends a great deal of time on some issues of mysogyny and other feminist issues.	2001-06-25

It is the kind of disjointed story about Marian Mountain's discovery of Zen.

It is nicely bound, on superb high quality glossy paper, with stunning photographs of Tibet.  Everything about it just makes you want to cradle, or worship, it.<br />Then there's the text.  They took a lecture that H. H. the Dalai Lama gave on the 4 Noble Truths and cut it (thank heavens) and put it in the book.  The result is weird.  The extremely philosophical treatise makes an odd accompaniment to scenes of Tibet.  On the one hand, you're reading about how all the world is suffering and we are ignorant louts for getting so caught up in this illusion, and then we glance at the photograph (every pair of pages has one, so you're always looking at something wonderful).  I thought, &quot;Gee, if I'm not supposed to care about the world, or I'm not supposed to delight in its pleasures and glories, then what is all this color and visual drama?  Illusion?&quot;  Thus, the book highlights in an unwitting way one of the paradoxes of Buddhism... we try to disentangle ourselves from the grosser life of merely sensate pleasure but we can and should still love the world.  Who says Christianity has a corner on the market of paradox?!<br />Still, there are some real textual gems and pearls scattered in the pages, and it is quick reading because of all the pictures.

The author injects her personal quest for a teacher, for answers, and for a good relationship with her mother into a series of interviews with Tibetans.  I found the down-to-earthness absolutely refreshing.  Her encounter with the Dalai Lama reinforces my extremely high opinion of him (he jumped down one step and told Sandy &quot;Now I'm on the same level as you!&quot;)  But all sorts of little vignettes shine forth...

In fact, I *HAD* to read &quot;Cobra Event&quot; for a school project and thought,  &quot;Oh, yuck!  Another bloddy virus story!&quot;  However, it turned out  to be very exciting and captivating.  If you can make it past the first 50  pages where a gruesome death and even more gruesome autopsy are described  in ways that... well, don't eat anything first!   Then you find yourself in  a story of international intrigue.  I liked the way he injected chapters  about the real state of bioweapons in the world...that is the scariest part  of the book!<br />However, one thing I find strange is his Hemingway-esque  writing style.  Present often has a paragraph of about 25 sentences, each 3  or 4 words long.  Why?  It doesn't add anything and rather it detracts.  I  always found *MANY* instances where he repeated himself.  It seemed like he  wrote the same paragraph twice and couldn't figure which version to keep,  so he put them both in the book. This sort of thing is OK for the Bible but  not modern fiction.  It makes Preston's books appear to be very poorly  edited.  Maybe they are!	2000-08-17

Martha Sherrill seems to do a good job of being an  investigative reporter; at least she was there many times and close to the  &quot;inside.&quot;  Moreover, she injects her own spiritual quest and  longings into the narrative, which I thought was remarkable.  That she  would buy one of the Ladyworks hair devices for her mother (they cost $100  each) shows that she supported Jetsunma's organization financially, as well  as with her presence and interest.  The one mystery that remains is why the  &quot;book deal&quot; seemed to turn sour.  That is, it started off with  Jetsunma's blessing and ended up being quite an expose.  Though Sherrill  hints many places at journalistic freedom, she doesn't come right out and  say &quot;At this point I knew I would probably offend many but I had to  tell the truth,&quot; or something like that.<br />One unfortunate aspect of  this book is that it seems to give Tibetan Buddhism a bad name, making it  seem like it is full of cults and crazy gurus.  Jetsunma herself sounds  more New Age than Tibetan Buddhist, so one must be careful.  But compare  this book's story to that of Butterfield's &quot;The Double Mirror&quot;,  or to the lifestory of Chogyam Trungpa.  I highly recommend &quot;The  Double Mirror&quot; after reading &quot;Buddha from Brooklyn&quot; because  it is a bit more in the traditional Tibetan Buddhist heritage, but it gives  one another uncomfortable view of the whole system.	2000-08-14

Don't read it if you are squeamish.   The horrific tales of life on the turkey farm will make you a vegetarian  for sure, and probably against capital punishment.  I worked on a dairy  farm one summer and know that farms are cruel places though the turkey  stories were disgusting. One thing I really admired was how Jensen made me  feel sympathy for his dying father.  Actually, what really got me was the  story of how his father, as a young man, tested a Percheron horse by taking  him into deep water.  The beautiful symbolism of this act is just  breathtaking.  It was the high point of the book.  So all in all, the  structure of the book -- its interweaving of three separate strands (the  turkey farm, his father, his own life) -- plus the amazingly deep and  profound content make this a stunning must-read book.  But read it in  private so you can cry your eyes out without anybody seeing you and  wondering if you are psycho.  You'll need lots of tissues to make it  through this short tome!	2000-08-09

It doesn't have too much to do with Zen, though.  The author talks  about suizen, which means &quot;Blowing Zen,&quot; and is the link between  shakuhachi and Zen.  But Brooks doesn't tell much about further meditation  or how shakuhachi helped calm his mind.  There was a link missing between  his desire to change out of a boring, clone-like life and into an authentic  one, and how playing shakuhachi helped him do that.  It sounds to me that  his wife, Diane, probably did more to lift him out of his inauthentic  lifestyle.<br />But there are moments of great beauty.  One is on page 225 (of  the paperback edition) where he is trying to convince Ozawa-san to do  something about his existential angst.  Here are the 4 sentences that leapt  out at me:  &quot;If you are [getting some peculiar pleasure or some reward  out of this destructive way you're living], you probably won't stop.   You'll talk about change, make it into a hobby.  You may even try to find  someone to hep you, but deep down you won't change if you're not really  serious.  Seriousness is its own change.&quot;	2000-07-09

It tells about the experiences of Americans who practice with Cheri Huber, and they usually tell it like it is &quot;under  the skin.&quot;  At first their comments seemed trivial and whiney until I  realized how closely I identified with them.  Then I realized what a gift  they have to practice in that place with Cheri.  Her own story comes last  and it is definitely one of the highlights, but it helps to have seen her  first through the students' eyes as almost a god-like being.  She really  isn't, at least in her own words.<br />The quality that I liked so much about  this book is that it doesn't lecture AT you, telling you all the theory and  the steps and the path, etc.  It is much more subtle than that, much  simpler yet extremely deep.  What you get in the end is a feeling that a  spiritual practice is not only possible but extremely beautiful and good.   You almost feel as you though you've been given a kick-start into a good  practice.	2000-06-29

Lewis and &quot;The Great Divorce.&quot;  It had a certain dream-like quality but with a harsh edge of judgmentalism.  Nevertheless, I love both books and will reread  &quot;The Garden.&quot;  It humanized Tibetan Buddhism enormously and  offered a lot of very sound Buddhist philosophy, as well as some  surprisingly good meditational hints!  All in all, an excellent book  despite the weird, monistic ending.  I found that to be a little  unsatisfying, partly because it didn't seem that clear and because it tried  to be mystical.  But the conversations he had with the great masters were  all great and well worth the price of the book.<br />But I must add that the  theory that we entirely create the world, that any suffering or pain we  experience is due to something bad we did in our past lives, irked me.  I  haven't found anything quite like this in other forms of Buddhism and it  put me off.  In fact, it angered and challenged me, which is okay.  But  just be warned that you, too, might find this book irritating or  mind-stretching.	2000-06-16

While I disagree with the premise that GUIs are inherently evil and moronic, and that command lines are better are smarter, I found this quite an interesting book.  Much of what the author says is true though the  writing is sophomoric at times, especially when he tries to sound hip and  cool.  There were some blatant inaccuracies and some other things that I  looked askance at, especially since I have extensive experience with  Windows 95/98 as well as Linux, as well as Unix on &quot;grown-up  platforms.&quot;  But the book makes for an interesting conversation piece,  gets you thinking.  At least it made me think more about the role that  vision plays in intellectual processes, as opposed to verbal channels (i.e.  language and text.)  Ultimately Stephenson confuses his theory  &quot;selling OS's is ridiculous&quot; with the theory that &quot;visual  based systems are inferior.&quot;  If you read his book critically and take  its rants and raves with many grains of salt, it can be fun and rewarding.	2000-05-31

What a thoroughly enjoyable book!  This is a stunning picture of the development of the personal computer and companies it spawned.  It tries to cover an enormous amount of ground, which is why I forgive it for being  somewhat shallow at times.  Its coverage of the early days, such as the  1975 Altair, is in some ways better and more detailed than later years.  I  wanted a few more technical details and a few less horror stories about  companies folding from competition with Microsoft.  But overall, it is  still a great read, very fast.  The chapters are small, which helps!	2000-04-05

I am so sorry that I chose this book for my CS 1 course!   I wish I could start the semester over.  At first glance this looked like a reasonable book but by Chapter 3 I knew we were in trouble.  Bishop introduces  material too quickly, too compactly, and too abstractly.  Her examples are  huge and cumbersome.  My kids are really confused and probably annoyed --  Here's another stupid college textbook that makes us feel like nincompoops!   The title is *QUITE* misleading; this is *NOT* a gentle introduction to  Java or programming principles.

But I still value my Christian heritage and in a strange way I  still believe in God.<br />I read almost all of C. S. Lewis's works many years  ago and &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is the best.  My sister loves it too.   We have both read it multiple times and given it as presents.<br />There are  so many precious images -- the Great Lady who was an unknown saint was my  favorite.  I must admit that it is a bit stark and frightening.  It is kind  of a shock theology, meant to stir you from your spiritual slumber.  But  what you get is an electrifying glimpse into the divine and the vast worlds  upon worlds that span all the horizons beyond our feeble minds and  hearts.<br />Reading Lewis did not make me stay an orthodox Christian but in a  deeper sense he conveyed some fundamental truths that go beyond  Christianity (a sentiment he would have no doubt have found horrifying!)	1999-10-06

It doesn't make incredibly grandiose and silly statements and it is written in a very clear, straightforward manner.  Focusing largely on the  early days of the Internet, especially BBN's role in creating the original  ARPANET, this book is a pleasant blend of character portraits and technical  material, though it is somewhat light on the technical apsects.  Still it  spent less time than other computer history books on hiring and firing and  other rather boring junk.<br />My only gripe with this book is that it peters  out right about 1990 and flies over the modern Internet with too little  detail.  Perhaps that story is best told in a follow-up book.<br />I highly  recommend it.	1999-07-13

Then the author never quite leaves alone the personality clashes  and company politics.  Not that that stuff's not interesting; it is!  And  the PARC story seems to indicate that such interpersonal dynamics make or  break some companies.  But it was tiresome.  I had a very hard time  starting this book because of the people crap, and then I thought the  technology stuff was weak and thinly covered.  There were glimmers of  interesting comments about software and hardware, such as Smalltalk's role  and the birth of the laser printer.  But the book could have lost 100 pages  and been a better read.  I think the author had a point to prove about how  people often can't work together.  Surprise, surprise!  I've known this for  years.  To make this more palatable, the author should have included some  photos.  I had to look in &quot;Nerds 2.0.1&quot; for good photos of Bob  Taylor.  Somehow, just seeing his face made the whole drama a bit more real  and a bit more human... I don't know why.  Maybe it was because I had this  really weird (and totally untrue) image of who and what he was from  Hiltzik's description.  After seeing his picture, I felt more sympathetic.   On another matter, I thought Hiltzik's depiction of the Steve Job's  &quot;raid&quot; on PARC was fascinating and I applaud his scrupulous  efforts to finding out the real truth, but in the end saying most of this  seems to be lost in myth.	1999-06-30

What a great story!  There are many little gems throughout the book, though it is kind of morbid and I could  only read a page or so at a time.  The stories from India are pretty  fantastical and hard to believe, though.  I found the afterward to be  stunning, how Ms. Blackman discovered she had advanced lung cancer and was  going to die.  It was the captstone of the whole volume.  This book makes  sobering but good reading for anyone, even those who are in the bloom of  health and are young.	1999-05-16

In this autobiography, Donohue chronicles his peregrinations across the USA while drinking himself silly.  He gets a few lucky breaks, some money here and there, a little success, but he drinks it all away.  In the end,  the book snaps shut abruptly with no conclusion, no climax, no denouement,  nothing.  Just snaps shut in a very odd way.  But then it is just a peek  into one man's life, the life of an alcoholic.  I definitely had more  sympathy for homeless people, even alcoholic homeless people, after reading  this book.  The potential reader should be warned that it contains a lot of  economic theory that Donohue, who actually graduated from college with a  business degree, develops.  So that stuff is a bit dry and you can safely  skip over most of it.	1999-05-07

I thank the author for a generally accurate and error free book.  Though not perfect, it is  better than many Java and JavaBeans books.  <br />One thing I found somewhat  irritating was that the makefile contents for the JAR utility were  reproduced for each and every program.  Soon I just skipped all of those;  they wasted paper and room.<br />Another irritant is that the author didn't  show how to just use jar to wrap up the beans.  You don't HAVE to use  nmake.  I was able to get along without it.<br />I also found the 2nd person  viewpoint writing style to be a little awkward (You do this, etc.)  In  fact, the style is a bit too wordy and drawn-out.  Why can't anyone write a  SHORT and terse Java book?!<br />But overall, this was a very useful book and  I'm glad I read it.	1999-04-14

My students hate it and I find it very difficult to wade through.  It doesn't talk much about Java 1.2; in fact the title is a laugh.  And so much of the example code hinges around  this LISP interpreter that the authors are so proud to show off.  This  comes at the expense of useful examples.  The chapter on RMI left me  baffled.  Their first example as so abstract as to give me no feel for what  RMI does.  Then they launch into the semantics of remote references,  without even with only two line drawings that I'm still trying to figure  out!  Very murky and poorly thought out.

It is as though you looked right into the soul  of the man &quot;Shed.&quot;  One thing I must denigrate is the  slaughterhouse scene.  It seemed a little too gratuitiously yucky for  effect, to make a point.  That part was the toughest to get through and it  reminded me of the horrifyingly gray world of &quot;Gorgemghast.&quot;  But  overall, what a book!  Phew!
