US	52637469	R4Y8J7GV9FO5T	0671016776	12366720	Gravity	Books	5	1	1	N	N	One of Gerritsen's BEST	While I've read a few of Tess Gerritsen's novels, this is one of my favorites.  The story grabs you from the very first page &amp; never lets up.  Not only is it suspenseful but it also gives great insight into the space program &amp; how the astronauts prepare themselves for their shuttle flights.  Packed with plenty of action, scary moments &amp; interesting characters, Emma Watson &amp; Jack McCallum in particular are major standouts.  I'm surprised that Hollywood never picked this for a movie-it would definitely give the Alien pictures a run for their money.  Then again, maybe if it were on the big screen it wouldn't do justice to the book-something that happens more often than not in Tinseltown.  Very highly recommended.	2003-07-21
US	52637469	RSZRSDJSRG2E	1551666790	323616531	Private Lives (MIRA)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Very Good Summer Read	This is the second Karen Young book that I've read-the first being Good Girls.  The story hooks you from the first chapter and never lets up.  Elizabeth Walker is a flawed but likable character who by the end of this story manages to get her life back in order.  Many other interesting characters round out the story, and without giving away too many details, let's just say that after some tragic moments, Elizabeth finds love as well as an instant family and friendship.  A nice, fast read that will have you turning the pages in anticipation of the final outcome.  Highly recommended.	2003-06-05

This book is even more timely to read now that Ronnie's ex-hubby Phil Spector was arrested the other day for the murder of a woman in his house.  It gives great insight not only into Ronnie's life story and rise to stardom but also into Phil's personality and temperament.  While there is absolutely no doubt of Phil's musical genius, the man was(and possibly still is)mentally unstable(he claims to be bipolar and does not like to take his meds).  I first bought and read this book when it first came out years ago but it is still a great read, one of the very best rock-bios around.  It is also a great companion piece to Darlene Love's autobiography.  If you are a fan of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, both books are essential reading.  Very highly recommended.	2003-02-05

I've always paced myself with her books because there aren't that many to begin with plus it's been over 3 years since KHT last wrote one.  I hope that she is working on something new, because all of us Callahan Garrity fans are anxiously awaiting the next mystery featuring Callahan, Edna & the rest of the House Mouse cleaning crew!  As for Midnight Clear-it just doesn't get any better than this.  Kid brother Brian, who had been in absentia for 10 years suddenly shows up at Edna's doorstep with a surprise in his truck-a 3 year old girl named Maura.  There is a major murder mystery for Callahan to solve, but it looks like Brian is the prime suspect-his ex-wife is found murdered in her bed.  You'll find yourself rapidly turning the pages until you reach the surprise ending, KHT pulls out all the stops with this one.  Once you reach the very end, however, you realize you want more books to come out featuring Callahan Garrity & co.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, if only Ms. Trocheck would write as often as Sue Grafton does!  Very highly recommended-along with all of her other books.  Enjoy!	2002-12-17

Pellegrino didn't spend half as much time in jail as he's written in this book.  The real Michael Gambino is Carlo's great grandson-a 16 yr. old still in high school.  Don't waste your time or your money on this, folks.  Not recommended at all.	2002-08-29

From the very first page it's like the story and characters catch your attention right away.  The info that heads each chapter regarding the sea turtles is actually quite interesting, and I was saddened to read at the end of the book how they are quickly becoming an endangered species.  This story of how Cara Rutledge, after losing her job at a Chicago advertising firm, returns home to her mother's beach house in Isle of Palms, SC, is a very warm, touching one that explains how she finally bonds with her seriously ill mother-Olivia(Lovie)Rutledge, having left home at 18 due to constantly fighting with her father.  Cara reconnects with her childhood best pal Emmi, plus finds true love when least expected.  Lovie's houseguest(and caretaker)Toy Sooner is another memorable character-her initial meeting up with Cara is not a good one but soon the two of them learn to accept one another as well as become fast friends.  This story is one you'll definitely remember long after the last page has been turned.  Very highly recommended.	2002-06-22

This is definitely one book that I hated to have come to an end; that's how great this story is.  If you enjoy well-written, quickly developed characters &amp; a storyline that tugs at your heartstrings, then this is the book for you.  Wish You Well is a departure from David Baldacci's mystery/suspense novels and a very nice one at that.  You will find yourself breezing through the pages from the opening chapter and these characters, particularly the children-Lou(short for Louise)and her little brother Oz(short for Oscar)are ones that you actually care about.  What a wonderful movie this would make, but what am I saying here-there's no actual foul language or sex scenes-not exactly Hollywood's cup of tea.  Still, if it were done right, it would at least make a good Made For Television film.  I hope Mr. Baldacci eventually writes another novel about real people from different eras.  Very highly recommended.	2001-12-04

Dorothea Benton Frank is one helluva great writer!  I anxiously look forward to her next book, whether or not it is another Low Country tale it is sure to be a winner.  The way she introduces her characters then develops them is what holds my interest with each chapter.  I disagree with the reviewer that said Caroline Wimbley Levine is Susan Hayes all over again! WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! I did enjoy it, though, when DBF had the two characters meet up toward the end of the book-maybe someday she will write a book mainly about their friendship.  I liked Caroline's character &amp; how she finally got up the gumption to leave her cheating, lowlife hubby &amp; take her son to stay at Tall Pines.  I can't decide which character was my favorite, Caroline, Lavinia or Millie-all are good, strong women &amp; they keep you turning the pages.  All in all, a terrific story that I highly recommend.  Kudos to DFB on her 2nd triumph!	2001-10-17

A long time ago a friend from work lent me the book Strange Brew, which I immediately loved and I was determined to begin the Callahan Garrity series in chronological order. I breezed through this in 2 days and found it to be a fast, fun read. I definitely plan to continue with the rest of the Callahan Garrity series. The concept of running a housecleaning business while solving murder mysteries is a very good one. The other characters also play a major part in the story, beginning with Callahan's mom Edna as well as the 'girls' that work for their House Mouse cleanup biz, plus Bucky Deaver, a cop that Callahan used to work with when she was a police officer on the Atlanta force. If you like mysteries where the main character has both intelligence and a sense of humor, then you can't go wrong with this series. Very highly recommended.	2001-08-28

What a brilliant, beautiful story Dorothea Frank has written! From the first page to the very last(including the author's notes at the end)I was mesmerized by the story of the Hamilton clan from Sullivan's Island. For a first novel, I found this to be a towering achievement for Ms. Frank. Clear and concise writing, with a lead character that stands out on every page you can't help but cheer her on as she faces every obstacle that comes her way, whether as a grown woman in 1999 or as a young teen in 1963. I especially enjoyed the character of Livvie, the Hamilton's housekeeper who was of course a wise old sage who kept the children in line and always dispensed good advice. If only Hollywood would take notice and consider this for a film, with Dorothea Frank writing the script, of course. In closing, I would have to say that Ms. Frank is a major talent and I eagerly look forward to reading her 2nd novel, The Plantation. Way to go, Dot Frank! Long may you write! Very highly recommended.	2001-08-26

Then one day with nothing much else to read, I picked it up &amp; started reading, figuring after a few pages I'd put it down for good.  Not a chance.  I found myself sitting there getting more &amp; more caught up in this story of Jackie, Ethel &amp; Joan.  Although I was very young when JFK became President, reading of those golden Camelot days brought back wonderful as well as tragic memories.  My heart especially goes out to Joan, the way she was used &amp; abused not just by the Kennedy family but by her then husband, Ted!  What an arrogant lowlife!  Though the book does give Joan's lifestory ample coverage, the majority, in my opinion, is about Jackie &amp; Ethel.  All in all a very good read &amp; highly recommended.	2001-08-03

This was an extremely talented woman, who worked hard at her craft.  It could very well be that had she not been discovered by Desi Arnaz, Jess Oppenheimer &amp; Marc Daniels while performing in the play Voice Of The Turtle, Vivian may have become one of the finest stage actresses of her generation.  Desi &amp; his producers knew immediately that she was THE ONE to portray Ethel Mertz.  Needless to say, despite all of her insecurites &amp; ailments, Vivian went on to become a television icon, albeit very reluctantly.  There was a love-hate relationship with Lucille Ball, who soon realized with Viv's perfect timing that she couldn't have done her shows without her.  Lucy grew to respect &amp; admire Vivian, allowing her to come up with ideas &amp; suggestions to make the I Love Lucy show even better as time went on.  Most of us fans of the show are all too well aware of Vivian's bitter feud with Bill Frawley, they hated each other on sight.  Viv resented having the 20-something years older Frawley portraying her husband, Fred, as well as having to look frumpy next to Lucy Ricardo(something Ms. Ball demanded from the very start).  The story of Vivian Vance was not always a happy one, but this wonderful woman was more than just a television pioneer, she was all too human &amp; had her quirks &amp; insecurities like everyone else.  Despite failing health, Ms. Vance performed on stage up until she became too seriously ill to continue.  It's all here, her many stage &amp; television roles, an occasional film role, her friendships &amp; marriages.  Highly recommended not just for fans of the I Love Lucy show, but especially for fans of the late, great Vivian Vance.	2000-12-30

Super handsome, charismatic Jack Sullivan has just won the governorship of Mississippi, but a bullet cuts him down during a public appearance.  Turns out that Jack was a bully and a mad-man rolled into one, and so many people wanted him dead, including the family he married into. If you enjoy a good read that never slows down, I strongly advise this book.  It is the first book I've ever read by Karen Young, and you can be sure I plan to read more of her work.	2000-10-14

Harry Bosch	Since I only recently started reading the Michael Connelly series featuring Harry Bosch, I made sure to start reading them in order.  This 2nd book is just as great as the first book(Black Echo)and the story delves a bit more into Harry's character-something that you will likely find in all of Connelly's books featuring Harry Bosch.  This time around Harry gets involved(without the approval of police brass-surprise)in the murder of fellow detective Calexico Moore, found dead in a rundown hotel room.  As expected, there's more than one plot that intertwines as the story develops.  Harry takes over the cases of a detective he works with in the RHD, a man with a drinking problem who suddenly calls in saying he's taking early retirement.  The first case Harry looks into involves a dead laborer found just outside of a diner frequented by cops.  It so happens that particular case was worked on by none other than the late Det. Cal Moore and bingo! Harry, with a little extra research starts to put two and two together and you're well on your way to a fast moving, mesmerizing story with a really surprise ending.  Very highly recommended, especially for those that enjoy good mystery/suspense stories with unlike detective heroes.	2000-10-05

John Jakes has long been one of my favorite historical writers, and whenever it's announced that he has a new novel coming out I make note of it &amp; make it a point to shop for it.  However, in this case, I found On Secret Service to be not as well written as his other series(in particular the North &amp; South series &amp; the Kent Family Chronicles).  This novel is a bit too long, and while historically accurate &amp; interesting, the storyline starts out fine but then drags in the middle, and I really felt bad for main character Lon(Alonzo)Price-Mr. Jakes put him through way too much pain &amp; torture-the fact that he even survived is nothing short of a miracle!  I won't go into any specific details but I also thought the character Hanna Seigel should have been given alot more development, her love affair with soldier Frederick Dasher was all too brief-why couldn't they have had more time together before tragedy struck?  Anyway, for fine historical novels John Jakes is still the best, I only wish this book didn't read as though he only half-heartedly wrote it.	2000-09-21

Plenty of singles and albums are listed that are worth hundreds  of dollars if they're in mint condition and have a picture sleeve cover.   It is also fun to look up the names of favorite artists &amp; groups to see  what, if any, holiday tunes they may have recorded.  So next time you're  cleaning out your attic, basement or in back of your closet, if you come  across an old box or bin of 45s and/or albums-poke through, you never know  if some hidden treasure is in there, and not just Christmas music either!

If you're looking for a fast moving page turner, this is the book for you! Doug Kennedy has you hooked from the opening chapter.  Ben &amp; Beth  Bradford live in the typical yuppie setting, a big house in Connecticut, a  beautiful baby son &amp; all the trappings of wealth.  From the beginning  it becomes clear that Beth is a cold fish, and whenever Ben tries to talk  things over with her she's not interested.  Before long Ben realizes she is  cheating on him, but with whom?  When he finds out, he has a confrontation  with this man that will drastically change the course of his life.  Ben  winds up on the run, changing his identity in the process and the action  never lets up.  Very highly recommended, along with Kennedy's next novel,  The Job.	2000-07-29

At least Mr. Epstein did have the family's approval to write this book, and to  be interviewed by him as well.  Like most baby boomers, I grew up listening  to NKC's music but never really knew much about the man other than the fact  that his wife's name is Maria, his daughter is Natalie Cole &amp; that he  died of lung cancer at age 45.  This book enlightens us on Nat King Cole  not just as a singer and musician but as a man.  I really felt for the Cole  family when they were subjected to prejudice while moving into their home  in Hancock Park.  I also felt anger while reading of how a group of  radicals attacked NKC while performing onstage in Alabama, planning to  kidnap him.  Mr. Epstein also periodically mentions the warnings about  cigarette smoking throughout the book, as it is heavy smoking(several packs  a day)that eventually killed NKC.  The book is still highly recommended for  all fans of one of the greatest singers of romance, bar none.	2000-07-26

It turns out the case he's  called in to work on involves the body of an old war buddy named Bill  Meadows.  Harry has to find out who killed him and why.  His maverick ways  of doing his job have gotten him in trouble in the past, transferring him  to Hollywood Homicide where he is under surveillance by 2 IAD detectives  named(I kid you not)Lewis &amp; Clarke!  I won't divulge any further info  but must tell you if you like great mysteries with likeable detectives then  get started with this book &amp; look for further books with Harry Bosch as  the main character.

Mickey is unjustly accused of murdering a union  organizer, merely because of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

This novel first came out when I was still in high school, and regrettably I have never seen the mini-series.  Wouldn't it be great for cable tv if they'd have the Mini-series  channel-rerunning all those old, classic mini-series and made-for-tv  movies?  Anyway, getting back to this book.  Right from the beginning, it  was very clear that Joseph Armagh was not a very likable character.  I  realize all that he'd been through with his mother dying while they were  crossing the ocean(in steerage), leaving him with his younger brother and  newborn baby sister.  Finally reaching New York, they(the Irish)were turned  away, sent off to Philadelphia where Joseph eventually learned of the death  of his father.  Broke and starving, Joseph puts the children in a Catholic  orphanage &amp; does whatever he can to earn a few dollars &amp; feed  himself.  As the years go by he realizes he needs a fortune to survive in  this country, and will do whatever it takes to build one.  Coming upon a  newspaper article one day he reads of men making money working in oil, all  it takes is drilling equipment and determination.  After making  arrangements to leave the children at the orphanage for at least a year, he  books passage on a train to Titusville and meets up with another young man  named Haroun with the same idea.  Reluctant to make friends with this boy,  they find themselves squeezed onto the train like cattle, and without any  seats they have to stand on the steel plates between the cars.  Haroun  slips when his foot is caught &amp; Joseph does his best to free him  without losing his foot.  As fate would have it they meet the very rich  &amp; powerful Mr. Healy, who takes a liking to the boys, moving them into  his home &amp; the rest, as they say is history.  Both work for Mr. Healy,  Haroun out in the oil fields &amp; Joseph in his office where he learns the  business &amp;inherits everything years later when Mr. Healy dies.  As he  gets older Joseph becomes more &amp; more set in his ways, angry at the  world &amp; not wanting to open up to anyone.  The story takes a more  interesting turn when he marries &amp; starts his family, but enough of my  synopsis, get the book for yourself &amp; you're in for a treat.	2000-06-05

It tells everything you'd want to know about her and more.  How she decided to make singing her career and how she paid her dues by singing at every country fair and  carnival that would have her.  Before long her golden voice drew alot of  attention, and she was invited to try out on Arthur Godfrey's tv show.   Needless to say, Patsy was so well-liked she topped any other competition  and won first prize-a recording contract.  True music lovers will enjoy  reading about how the great Owen Bradley produced and guided her as well as  what went on in the studio with Patsy, Owen &amp; her backup band.  Patsy  was definitely ahead of her time and feared no one.   What a tragedy that  she only lived to be 31 years old.  Her music lives on forever.  Highly  recommended.	2000-04-27

I couldn't resist writing a quick review.  When I finished it I noted how well written it was and how  touching the story of Claude Rawlings was.  If you're really into music  you'll identify with this book, though as another reviewer mentioned it is  hard to believe a 6 yr. old would practice for hours and hours on end.   This would make a great movie!  It's too bad Frank Conroy only wrote a  small handful of novels, his writing is first-rate.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-26

I popped a big band cd on the stereo for background music and found myself caught up in the story of the Swing Sisters-a band started up  by ex-burlesque star Rita who'd planned to sing lead, drummer Roz, who must  keep her sexual preference a secret at all costs, Sara on the piano, trying  to leave her broken marriage behind her, trumpet player Tonia who becomes  involved with the wrong man and last but not least Lovey, the ex-farm girl  who could sing like an angel.  What more could you want from this  fast-paced story of an all girl band back in 1937?

Afterward I felt even more respect and admiration for Pat Summitt and the Tennessee Lady Vols.  You realize right away that Pat's  tough-love style of coaching is for the good of the team.  If she picked on  any particular players more than others, if she called their name more than  others, it meant she knew they were really special and she wanted them to  push themselves to the limit that she knew they were capable of.  At the  start of the 97-98 season, Pat took 4 incoming freshmen-Teresa Geter(Tree),  Kristin (Ace) Clement and 2 more &quot;Meeks&quot; - Tamika Catchings and  Semeka Randall, and made each one an integral member of the team.  One  amusing chapter mentions Pat's initial confusion hearing the name  &quot;Meek&quot; so many times in the locker room and on the court.  Along  with the 2 freshmen Meeks there was Junior star player Chamique Holdsclaw  and of course they all called each other Meek.  Pat tells it all here,  giving a little bio on these 4 freshman(where they hailed from, family  life,etc.)and tells tales that are both moving and quite funny.  Despite  early reservations, Pat decided to loosen up with the team and found  herself having fun all the way to the championship.  It wasn't all fun and  games, though, as Pat had to deal with the tragic death of the son of close  friends, an obsessed fan of Kyra Elzy's who turned out to be a stalker,  various injuries and just plain exhaustion.  Thankfully, she has top  assistant coaches in Mickie DeMoss, Holly Warlick(who even played for Pat  Summitt on the 76-80 Lady Vols) and Al Brown.  This book is a must-have for  all fans of women's basketball.  Very highly recommended.	2000-04-26

I remember the story as if I'd just read it last week-5 frat boys who became Big Men On Campus, their stories are true and there's never a dull moment.  It's all here, the keg parties,  the football games, the protests, etc.  The book would've made a great tv  mini-series, providing they let Larry Colton write the screenplay.  Anyway,  if this ever comes back in print you should make it a point to buy it.   Highly recommended.	2000-04-26

How well I remember on sick days off from work, I'd just prop myself on the couch with a blanket &amp; mug of tea &amp; tune in about 9am for back to back  episodes.  Whether watching Lucy take Vitametavegamin, baking a huge loaf  of bread, getting locked in the meat freezer or just plain trying to get  into showbiz, there's plenty of laughs galore from the funniest woman on  TV.  This book takes you back to those times &amp; there's plenty of  tidbits about guest stars, writers &amp; others who played a part in the  show.  Highly recommended for all fans of Lucy, Ricky, Fred &amp; Ethel.	2000-04-25

George's lifetime devotion to Gracie is very moving and you can't help but smile when you think of the 2 of them up there making everyone laugh.  I recently picked the book up  again at an infamous bargain book store, my original copy I'd lent out  years ago &amp; it was never returned.  One of the best showbiz books in  print, and one of the funniest books you'll ever read.  There'll never be  anyone like George &amp; Gracie, not in this lifetime.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-25

The Story of Burns & Allen	Books	5	16	18	N	N	A MUST-HAVE FOR ALL BURNS &amp; ALLEN FANS	If only this classic book were back in print-not only is it a biography of George &amp; Gracie, but it has several pages of pictures(many never before seen)as well as an appendix in the back giving the synopsis of every television episode from October 1950 thru September 1958.  The book is a  good alternate to Gracie-A Love Story written by George himself.  On  another note, if I may go a step further, why doesn't Nick-At-Nite pick up  the series, surely it's been in syndication for about 40 years?  It'd be  great fun seeing them again-George, Gracie, their son Ronnie,  Blanche  &amp; Harry Morton, &amp; Harry Von Zell.  Though they are quite dated,  these shows are still screamingly funny today.  Gracie Allen was the 2nd  funniest woman in television, the 1st being the incomparable Lucille Ball.   Highly recommended, especially if you are able to find it!	2000-04-25

Iwholeheartedly agree, having seen just about all of his movies overthe years.  I used to catch some of them on the Late Show(or even Late Late Show)while babysitting back in high school days, then over the years I've started collecting his films.  Bogie was a very complex, highly intelligent man-considering he hated school, he was one smart, tough cookie(sorry-couldn't resist).  Expertly researched and detailed, the book is chock full of photos &amp; filmography info at the end.  Of the Bogart biographies out there, this one stands out from all the rest.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-25

You've seen pictures of Pat on tv &amp; in the newspapers,  usually in some player's face during a crucial moment of a game &amp; you  might think, &quot;this woman is really tough on her players.&quot;  Well,  guess what? She IS tough, and many of the players that she's been toughest  on went on to be championship players in the WNBA after getting their  degrees at the University Of Tennessee.  Other than building championship  teams, Pat's main goal is seeing that her players get their education &amp;  graduate.  Everyone on the team must sit in the 1st 3 rows in their classes  and pay attention.  After reading this book, I came away with the  realization that she really does care about these young women and always  made it a point to assure them of this.  At times when she knew she'd  really have to lean on a player, Pat would contact their parents to give  them a heads up so that there would be no misunderstanding.  Pat Summitt  grew up tough but fair, not afraid of hard work and expecting alot from  others.  Her Definite Dozen System is easy to apply in any job, in all  walks of life.  You just have to be determined to overcome adversity and to  face every challenge that comes your way.  Highly recommended reading for  everyone, not just fans of women's basketball.	2000-04-17

What a life this wonderful woman has led and what a great story to tell!  As a lifelong fan I've collected several of her albums &amp; have followed her career.  Rosie tells it all, about growing up in Kentucky, starting a  singing career with younger sister Betty &amp; hitting the big time in New  York.  Years ago I had the pleasure of seeing her perform in a radio  sponsored concert in the Winter Garden in the World Financial Center.  She  knows how to please the crowd, chatting them up with little anecdotes and  doing several of her big hits(not just a medley of them either).  Rosie  Clooney is one of the most down to earth performers on earth and a major  talent.  Read this book and get the Girl Singer 2 cd set.  Both are very  highly recommended.  Thanks Rosie, for bringing so much pleasure to so many  people over the years.	2000-04-12

Bully is a real teen tragedy.  The boys involved in the crime had it all, came from  good homes, had nice cars, clothes &amp; anything else they could want.   The girls had it kind of tough and went looking for trouble, hanging at the  mall tends to get boring pretty fast.  Marty gets fed up with Bobby Kent's  constant teasing and tormenting and decides to get even, recruiting Lisa  &amp; the rest of their friends.  They thought they had it all figured out,  collecting all kinds of weapons to use after they lured him to the beach.   The crime itself is very disturbing and makes you realize how sick these  kids were.  A great, fast read.	2000-04-08

If you like interesting, fast moving stories with surprise endings,  this is the book for you.  Others I'd recommend are Peach and the followup,  Leonie.

The pages couldn't turn fast enough for me to keep up with Chucky &amp; the rest of the O'Malley family.  The 2nd half of the  book, John's Love Story was really moving-how Chuck's father, John The  Evangelist O'Malley(yes, it was his middle name)met &amp; fell in love with  the good April, who it turned out was supposedly &quot;engaged&quot; to Jim  Clancy, who would become the lowlife father of Chuck's true love,  Rosemarie.  John's Story takes place from 1918-1925 &amp; is an integral  part of the O'Malley legend.  If you've already read A Mid-Winter's Tale,  scoop this one up fast &amp; you'll be caught up in it in no time.  Can't  wait for the next installment, which I've no doubt should be out sometime  next year.	2000-03-23

After 3 or 4 chapters I realized this is not as good as Mr. Goulart's 1st Groucho  book-Groucho Marx, Master Detective-every line on every page was golden.   This, however, is slow moving and not as well written as the previous book.   It's almost as though it was dashed off in a hurry.  The editing itself is  very poor, I found several typos that made little or no sense.  I hope that  the 3rd Groucho book brings back that pizazz found in the 1st book.  Get  it? Got it?

I am a major fan of true crime stories and this is one of the best collections I've read in eons, never knew how twins could turn bad!  I gathered from many of these stories that  there is usually one twin more domineering than the other, something that  starts in infancy.  Some stories are really horrifying, others are just  plain outrageous.  Every one is a page turner and you'll never be bored.   Highly recommended, especially for those fascinated by the study of twins.   I gave the book 4 stars due to several typos, but otherwise it's a great  read.	1999-07-30

Guess I hated to see it end so fast, but it did give insight on things I did not know about  Tony.  He was in the Army and saw action in Europe during WW2, even if only  for about 4-5 months, he saw alot and came very close to becoming a  statistic himself.  Most enjoyable, though, was Tony recalling the days  when he first started out professionally and how he fought to make records  that were important to him, not what the pop charts dictated.  The mutual  admiration between Tony &amp; Frank(no last name needed)is also mentioned  quite a few times, making it clear there was great affection between these  two superstars.  Highly recommended for all Tony Bennett fans, and please,  how about a movie version starring that kid on Happy Days(Eddie Mekka-who  portrayed the Big Ragu)who sings just like Tony? Oh well, just a  suggestion...	1999-03-23

What a story! What a great woman! Being a rapidly-aging baby boomer myself, I have long followed Darlene's career,  but this book really gave me some incite into how much the woman has been  through.  I knew,for instance,she was Phil Spector's primary backup singer  for everyone on his Phillies records label, but never imagined how many  other singers and groups she sang along with, not just on record but in  concert too!  Truly amazing.  Darlene is probably the most underrated  singer on the planet, and one of the most down to earth as well.  Her  account of growing up and eventually facing prejudice, her failed marriages  and her shabby treatment not just by Spector but from peers in the  industry, record company executives, attorneys,etc. is a really sad story.   Thankfully, Darlene is a survivor, always having great faith in God, the  love of her husband Alton, plus a terrific sense of humor.  She often  relates in this book how so many people still don't know who she is or just  pass her by on the street.  Well, if I were fortunate enough to be on the  same sidewalk as Darlene, I would be too starstruck to even say hello or  remember my name.  If only today's &quot;divas&quot; had an ounce of her  talent and integrity.  Whether or not you're a fan of Darlene's and/or 60's  music, this is a must read for the historical info alone! Thanks for all  the music, Darlene, and keep on singin'!	1998-12-08

The Song Is You: A Singer's Art	Books	5	1	1	N	N	For Collectors Only	This is a book I first bought and read a few years ago, and from time to time still refer to it.  However, be warned-this is more about Frank as the singer and musician, rather than his life story(as if there are not enough  books out on that).  If you are a true collector of Sinatra music, this is  the book for you.  It is fun to put one of his albums on and read what went  on during the recording session.  The book is detailed regarding who was at  the session, who played on what, even who was in the room at the time, but  I found it fascinating and while reading felt as if I were there.   Friedwald knows his stuff and I hope he writes more books like this about  other singers and/or bands. Superb!	1998-12-08

From page one you find yourself swept up in the story and characters and wish the book lasted even longer.  Especially fun for  fans of Groucho Marx and the Golden Age of Hollywood.  Highly recommended!	1998-12-07

After finishing it I passed it along to friends in my office and have yet to get it back.  Went out and picked up a few more of  her books, this lady is one of the best writers around in ages.	1998-12-07

Penelope Williamson is an excellent storyteller and  develops her characters in such a way that you never lose track of who's  who and why.  A wonderful story, now I look forward to reading her other  works.	1998-11-30
US	52637469	RZVAHGK1QBDEN	0713724625	315811629	Beat Merchants: The Origins, History, Impact and Rock Legacy of the 1960's British Pop Groups	Books	5	7	7	N	N	AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR TRUE R&amp;R FANS	This is one of the best books ever written about the British Invasion bands of the 1960's.  Alan Clayson not only did his homework in researching the book, he was actually THERE-as a musician and contributing writer to  several British music newspapers and magazines.  He writes of bands forming  in the late 50's and how many(but not all)of them made it big after  following The Beatles &amp; Rolling Stones to the good ol' USA.  This story  is an integral part of 60's rock and roll, never boring and will leave you  wishing for an eventual followup.  Just looking at the pictures will have  you wondering &quot;whatever happened to?&quot;....A MUST READ!!!	1998-11-28

I actually bought the entire series &amp; only recently got the chance to sit down with the first volume of Diana Gabaldon's series about Scotland.  Well, talk about slow,boring and way too much detail!  I gave up after  about 10 chapters!  While Ms. Gabaldon's intense research &amp; knowledge  is admirable; there is such a thing as too much of a good thing!  Not the  type of book to breeze through; whether during a morning commute to work or  a rainy night at home when nothing interesting is on tv.  It's back to  mystery/thrillers for me!	1998-11-24
US	52637469	R1T2P46YTU0H92	0399144110	679783782	The General	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Superb!!!	Patrick Davis' first novel is a terrific, fast read.  From the first page to the last, you get caught up in the story and the characters.  Finally, a writer with a military background who doesn't waste alot of time on tedious  details; he gets the action going and doesn't let it stop til the very end.  Hollywood get ready-this book should definitely be made into a top-notch  movie!	1998-11-24
