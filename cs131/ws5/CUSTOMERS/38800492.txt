While this book is dated, the basic premise of the story had all the traditional earmarks of a Leonard novel.<br />Once the book begins hitting the climax, the book takes a totally different direction. The main storyline is aborted.<br />  I was listening to an unabridged audio version of this book.  I returned the book to Amazon since I thought I had an incomplete book.  The book ended on the 5th tape with no warning that it was complete.  A sixth tape was added which started with an Elmore Leonard short story that was included in a previous book.<br />Don't waste your time with this book.	2004-03-29

Joe Mantegna is great as usual.<br />This time Spencer gets involved with extra-marital affairs, creative bookkeeping, and an Enron type scandal.<br />As long as you maintain a light-hearted view of the details presented, the novel moves along nicely.  However, if you have any financial background at all, the basic premise of the book falls apart.<br />I know it is very moralistic to keep Spencer on the straight and narrow.  However, it has beceome very boring from a reader's standpoint.  No matter how enticing the female counterparts are, Spencer skillfully avoids them.  This is as exciting as watching paint dry.<br />This book is not nearly as good as last year's PotShot.	2004-03-29

This book included many characters from past books.  The love interest with Holly Barker was interesting.  Both individuals are portrayed as strong characters throughout the book.<br />This book was a welcome change from the previous Dirty Works novel.<br />Woods also appears to be setting the Holly Barker character in a different direction.  I believe he will have much stronger storylines with Holly in the CIA.<br />The missing link in the last two Stone Barrington novels is what happened to Arrington Calder.  She is never mentioned in either novel.	2004-03-22

However, &quot;the historical accuracy&quot; is severly in question.<br />This is a different mystery novel.  In order to enjoy this book, you must let reason fall by the wayside.  If you can't do that, this book would fail miserably.<br />The storyline, while interesting is not realistic.  The anti-heros, namely the Catholic Church, are portrayed in the worst  possible light.<br />The author has worked a very dry subject into an interesting storyline.	2004-03-18

The narrator was great.<br />The first section of the book caught my attention.  The initial setup and reasoning was first rate.<br />The first serious flaw came when the brothers instead of getting out of the country and enjoy the immense wealth are determined to find out more about the account they stole from.  WHY!!!!<br />The book became very bogged down about a third of the way through it.   The storyline became totally unbelievable.<BR>The Secret Service is made to look like rank amateurs. The love interest in the story was telegraphed so far in advance a first grader could figure out that she was part of the initial group stealing the money.<br />Two timid brothers have as much chance of pulling off this caper as someone winning the lottery on the first ticket purchased.<br />Metzer continues the hyper writing to the end.  In the process, he rips off at least three movies that had Disney as the scene of the climax.<br />The ending of the story is very unsatisfactory.  Don't waste your time with this book.	2004-03-17

This book is not even close to being complete.<br />The story also has significant flaws.  The Wolf demonstrates he has the ability to get to any perceived threat.  However, he allows Alex Cross free reign.<br />The story was also very choppy.<br />Patterson continues to stick to the same boiler plate when writing these novels.<br />Alex Cross neglects his family; someone in the FBI is a turncoat; his family is in mortal danger; higher authorities undermine Cross's attempt to resolve issues.<br />With that being said, I now have to wait for the next installment of this novel.  I would not read this book until the next one is completed.  Waiting 6 months to 1 year for the remainder of the story is a real turn-off.	2004-01-20

It was good enough to entice me to buy the other two novels.  Since I read the last book first, it is difficult to compare to the previous novels.<br />This book was very fast paced.  It would have helped if I read the other novels first.  However, the plot was enjoyable.

While he continues to use a template to his writing that is consistent with every Dirk Pitt novel, the subplots were well developed and interesting.<br />The Celtic history and questioning Homer's Odessey were very entertaining.<br />Anyone who is a fan of Dirk Pitt is ready for his near death-defying feats.  Cussler uses Dirk's introspective very well.  I do believe that Dirk Jr. &amp; Summer characters need to be much more developed.  <br />If Cussler is ending the Dirk Pitt saga, I hope that he greatly improves his other series.  The Golden Buddha was far from entertaining.	2003-12-17

They in general are very entertaining.  This book is a significant departure.  It appears the overall intent of the book was to make fun of every aspect of governmental and political life.<br />The characters in this book are totally unbelievable.  Character development is lacking.  There does not appear to be any focus on a particular storyline.<br />Should the Governor be removed for incompetence?<BR>Should Brazil give up as a police officer?  He definitely can't write.  <BR>Should Hammer continue working as the Chief of Police when she can't meet with the Governor in over a year?<BR>Should the people of Tangier give up because they are inbred?<br />This book does not carry any suspense.  The small amount of comedy is severely strained.<br />Cromwell should go back to writing mysteries and leave the dark comedy genre to the experts such as Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiassan.	2003-11-13

This book is not up to the early Cussler novels.  Additionally, I listened to this book on tape.  As a preface, I normally listen to 2 to 3 books per week on tape.  This story was so disjointed and had far to many one dimensional characters to ever remember who was on which side.<br />The fact that this ship can go undetected in extremely hostile waters, and the crew can accomplish impossible feats without ever incurring a fatal loss stretches the bounds of imagination.<br />The all in a day's work philosophy of this book doesn't flow.  After the risks being taken, the crew in general would require time to regroup.<br />The initial thrust of this book indicates that this ship is a merencary, however, they qualify it to the side of right.  The CIA becomes magically involved, the US Navy is willing to commit acts tandomount to war for the sole purpose of putting a Tibetian monk back in power in China.  Give me a break.  <br />Clusser's books have become nothing more than comic book type action hero stories.	2003-11-04

This book is about as far as you can get from Baldacci's other works.  I found the story very slow moving.<br />The narrator is a sure cure for insomina.  I will never again listen to anything she reads.<br />The ending of this book is so unrealistic that it defies any possible logic.  Yet the way the story was written, this ending was telegraphed about one quarter into the book.<br />Don't waste your time with this one.	2003-11-04

This book is a dramatic improvement over the Dirty Works novel.<br />While this book has a number of flaws, it maintains a good pace.  The storyline is interesting.  The one disappointing aspect of this book is that it does not center around Will Lee or his wife.  Rather the focus is on the Deputy FBI Director, Robert Kinney.  One has the feeling that this person will become the focus in future books.<br />I listened to this on audio cassette.  The reader was adequate.  However, there are a number of individuals capable of performing at a much higher level.	2003-10-24

The reader did an adequate job of presenting the story.<br />The basic plot and twists are interesting.  However, anyone with any knowledge of how the legal system works would not buy into this storyline.  This trial would become a mistrial many times over.  Fortunately our legal system is better than Grisham portrays it to be.<br />I did not feel this book was as compelling as many of Grisham's other novels.  However, the ending of this book was much more satisfactory than most of his other stories.	2003-10-22

Therefore, if you stopped listening, you would have to search the entire CD to determine where you left off. A 70 minute disk needs several breaks.<br />The story was abridged.  Whoever did the production should look for another job.  The first third of the novel was almost impossible to comprehend.  I read/listen to approximately 5 books per week.  This one was one of the worst editing jobs I have come across.<br />The story itself was a major reach.

The latest contrived garbage has no character development, totally unbelievable heros, and a storyline which just ends.  My guess is another book is quickly coming off the press with the same heros.  I do not know what Clancy was thinking of when he made this new &quot;elite&quot; group all related.<br />Clancy makes Jack Ryan Sr. appear to circomvent the entire US Constituion.  This is totally out of character.  Developing an asassination squad and making hits to stir things up is an extreme departure from previous books in this long running series.<br />One other key which does not work is the constant referral to blank Presidental pardons.  Those pardons would only work if the President was still in office.<br />This novel is definitely not worth spending any time on.	2003-09-12

I feel that Patterson should have made the transition to FBI much more quickly.<br />Patterson uses a common story line in all of these novels.<br />1. The Cross family is threatened.<br />2.

However, I can only guess that in order to save costs, they divided the CD segments into 15-20 minute intervals.  This is fine if you are listening to the CD uninterupted.  However, when you have to sort through 8-10 minutes to get back to where you left off, it can be annoying.<br />The book itself began with a good premise.  However, the author had several meaningless segments which had nothing to do with the main story.<br />Robinson's political overtones were also overbearing.  I am not a Clinton fan.  However, Robinson's portrayal is nothing less than a hatchet job.<br />The climax of the book centers around the Panama Canal.  The premise that the US would allow a private Chinese company to own the canal is totally absurd.<br />The ending appeared to be more of a chapter closure rather than completion of the book.  It left the impression that this book will become a series.<br />Robinson's last few books left much to be desired.  I would pass on this one.	2003-09-08

This is true in light of everything that happened in the world after this book was published.<br />Not being a military person, a lot of the descriptions regarding equipment was lost on me.  That was not really a problem since it did not detract from the plot or characters.<br />I believe the ending of the book came to fast and was not well thought out.

I was wrong.  The story is not logical, the political content is very one sided, and the story line stretches the border of reason.  <br />The ending of this book would cause a mutiny by anyone currently involved with the military.<br />This is one book that does not deserve to be read.	2003-07-30

However, the author does not do a very good job of keeping the reader in suspense.  I believe an eight grader could correctly guess what is going to happen next.<br />I believe Jon Smith's character is a real stretch.  The combination of being a top level biological scientist and a James Bond type agent doesn't make sense.  The first story he was introduced in was believable.  This one is not.<br />The author spends way to much time trying to weave suspense into catching a slow moving ship.  I cannot believe any government would allow that ship to get very far without being blown out of the water.<br />The sub story regarding Castilla's father really didn't work in this book.<br />Since the ending of this book was telegraphed so early in the novel, there was very little suspense left for the conclusion.	2003-07-24

Patterson reflects pure raw emotion in both Cross and Shaefer.<br />Patterson has a knack for developing totally amoral persons.  Using the internet as the back drop was also an interesting infusion.<br />This book is hard to walk away from.	2003-07-24

The plot is well developed.  The characters are very interesting.<br />Tony Britton does a great job as a reader.	2003-07-24

This novel differs from some of his others in that the hero actually has a sex life.  <br />While, I would highly recommend this book, Francis does throw out a number of easy clues to figure out the true villian in the story.	2003-07-24

I would highly recommend Sante Fe Rules, &amp; L.A. Times. The early Stone Barrington novels were well developed with interesting characters and good tie-ins between books.  However, the last 2 books in that series had serious flaws.<br />The Holly Barker series is more along the lines of his earlier works.  The characters are believable and well developed.	2003-06-17

I guess I am like the marathon runner.  After spending so much time with the ten other books, I felt forced to continue with the current edition.  <br />This book's ending was very poorly conceived.  It felt like the bell rang in an exam and everyone had to put down their pencils.  I almost started to root for Nicholas to end the torture of waiting for the final installment.<br />Lahaye should do everyone a favor and write the final book in a more concise fashion.  Yes, I am a junkie, I will force myself through the final book.  This is my punishment on earth.	2003-06-17

They both have similar writing styles with good character development.<br />In the latest installment, we see Lucas Davenport becoming bored out of his mind with marriage and his job.  He needs a complicated case to get his juices running.<br />The initial portion of the book is well developed.  Sandford puts up several dead-ends that mislead Davenport perfectly.<br />One of the positive traits that I enjoy about the Davenport character is his ability to see gray areas and not react in a black and white manner.  He is a hardened detective, yet he can be convinced to overlook situations.<br />I am looking forward to the next installment.	2003-06-17

I would rate this one as very average.<br />The first quarter of the book is compelling.  However, it quickly gets bogged down in insurance payments, that neither wife is actually entitled to.<br />This is light reading at best.  If you put down this novel you may not pick it up again for a long time.	2003-06-17
US	38800492	R1AW1IL350D09G	1587888785	48077056	Full Court Press	Books	3	1	4	N	Y	Not as good as Bump &amp; Run	After howling in Bump and Run, I couldn't wait to listen to Full Court Press.<br />The first half of the book continues at a great pace with a slew of colorful characters.  The last half was a let down.  I enjoyed it, however, it wasn't as crisp as Bump and Run. <br />With that being said, I would still recommend either buying or listening to this story.	2003-06-17

It was an easy read and fairly enjoyable.<br />The ending of the book stretched the bounds of reason.  However, it did provide a different scenerio from most legal works of fiction.<br />I enjoyed the Alex Cross series.  I believe those books were written at a higher level.	2003-06-17
US	38800492	R32UWPGM32MMCY	0316602051	985416391	The Jester	Books	5	0	1	N	Y	Great story - Plot and characters are well developed	James Patterson made a great transition to the Middle Ages.  His plot and character development were well thought out and very interesting.<br />This book is 180 degrees from Patterson's detective novels.  However, he is a master at weaving a story that keeps the reader interested.<br />The one enjoyable trait that Patterson has is to provide insight both from both sides.  I felt like I was inside the head of both the villians and the Jester.<br />I purchased the audio unabridged version of this book.  It was very well done.	2003-06-17
US	38800492	R1DXP1VXW6WBRO	0425181480	241175191	Bump and Run	Books	5	11	26	N	Y	Thoroughly enjoyable look at the NFL and NY.	This was my first experience reading Mike Lupica.  I enjoyed everything about the book.  I passed it out to several of my friends.  They all agreed it was a page burner with memorable characters.<br />Lupica has a sarcastic NY wit which is perfectly developed through his characters.  The fictional characters are thinly disguised.  I felt that I was reading a funny non-fiction account of the NFL.<br />I would highly recommend this book to any sports junkie.	2003-06-17
US	38800492	R205E6P5356CMQ	0739302248	106527389	The King of Torts	Books	3	4	4	N	Y	Another rags to riches back to rags novel	This book has Grishman's tried and true formula.  He does an excellent job of developing the characters.  The first two-thirds of the book are great.  The last third lends itself to a quick crash and burn.  This may work the first time.  However, as soon as the course of the book changes, anyone who has read any of the previous novels will guess what is going to happen next.  It is just a matter of when.<br />The interesting part of this book was the main character's willingness to cut corners to get ahead. At the same time he is very naive as to how big business really works. This makes Clay a much more believable person for this book's storyline.  One area that was totally unbelievable was the insider trading issue.  Anyone graduating from Georgetown law school would know these laws.	2003-06-02
US	38800492	RJ4X2UEBUU01G	0399149821	302553237	Dirty Work: A Stone Barrington Novel	Books	2	1	2	N	Y	Stone Barrington plots revisited.	I have read every novel of Stuart Woods.  I was looking forward to the next Stone Barrington saga.  Unfortunately, when I read this book it was like reliving many of the same plots included in Woods other books. <br />The plot of this book was totally unbelievable.  I read the other reviews listed. I honestly did not have the same impression.  <br />One small point, Woods does not finish the storyline that the story begins with.  <br />From the size of the print and line spacing it appears that Woods had to really stretch to make his 300 pages.<br />One of the teasers from the last book was not followed up on.  The Arrington character does not appear in this book, even though she was moving to New York and Barrington was desperately trying to reach her in the Short Forever.<br />This book was not worth buying.	2003-05-07

He merely changed the names of his NUMA main characters.<br />The writing was not up to the caliber of previous Dirk Pitt Novels.  It appears Clive is just trying to cash in on prior accomplishments.  The story lines have become extremely easy to forecast.<br />I have read all of Cussler's novels.  However, if they continue in this manner.  I will no longer be interested in reading his new novels.	2002-08-21
