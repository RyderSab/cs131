I am lying in the sun in Hollywood and I have just devoured this splendid John Schlesinger biography. I recommend it to every movie fan the world over.  It is a lovely book and worthy of its subject.<br /><br />Being north of forty, it would be impossible to underestimate the importance of John Schlesinger's influence on my life as a gay man.  Midnight Cowboy and Sunday Bloody Sunday were seismic movie going moments for me.  Truly great movies in their own right, both have fully-dimensional gay characters as well as homo-erotic moments that lodged in my young brain and stayed.  Jon Voight is a luscious Ken Doll in Midnight Cowboy.  And Murray Head could be the poster boy for sexy 70's male in Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Glenda Jackson watching Murray's perfect physique as he showered was thunderous for me because every day in Catholic high school I stood next to beautiful boys in showers and I couldn't stop staring and also could not forget none of them would ever be mine.<br /><br />And thank you John Schlesinger for Julie Christie!  The movie-going public will be forever in John's gratitude for giving us Julie.<br /><br />They say that the music one listens to in our teenage years becomes \\"our\\" passion music-wise for our entire lives.  Certainly, my life-long allegiance to Joni Mitchell and Aretha Franklin attests to that.<br /><br />I feel the same way about Julie Christie.  I was too young for Billy Liar and Darling when they came out.  But both movies mean a great deal to me now.  As do McCabe & Mrs. Miller and Shampoo and Return of the Soldier and Afterglow.  I love watching this creature on screen.  Julie is sexy to me even though I have no desire for her.  And I am as much a fan now as I ever was when I first laid eyes on her.  More of a fan probably.<br /><br />Bravo to William J. Mann for painting a vivid portrait of one of our greatest film directors.  And bravo John for your illustrious career!	2005-04-02

Glancing through some of the harsh reviews for this book I am struck by the realization that some very sad people must be severly allergic to sterling prose.  Or to honest and vivid gay sex.  Or both!<br /><br />I found the structure of this novel---beginning in 1983 and then jumping ahead to 1987---evoked for me Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, To The Lighthouse.  A main character dies in the gap between years in this book just as the beloved mother does in the Woolf novel.  (A novel I am perhaps foolishly assuming ever lover of great prose has read at least once.)<br /><br />Beyond the perfect structure of this book I found the writing to be absolutely cherishable.  I have not re-read sentences this often since reading The Hours by Michael Cunningham.  And the characters in this book are very true to the 80's that I remember very vividly.<br /><br />This astonishing author has brought back the sharp pain that never really leaves---most of my beloved friends of those 80's are long gone.  I miss them fresh after this book.<br /><br />If this book doesn't work a magic spell on you then you need to return to school and learn how to read with discernment and passion.  Bravo, Master Hollinghurst!	2005-01-16

Hayes. Point of fact, this book is a revelation. No, these are not the genteel stories your mom reads in Redbook and Ladies Home Journal beneath the humming dryer at the corner beauty parlor. Rather, these are pungent, sexy, heartbreaking renderings of young people---boys on the verge of becoming men mostly---who are wrestling against the undertow of their sexual desires. All of these stories are astonishing. One at least is a masterpiece. \\"When Jesus Came to Town\\" is the most vividly dramatic story I have read since first encountering the esteemed William Trevor. May this talented writer enjoy a career at least as long as Mr. Trevor. Bravo.	2002-12-03

Praising this author in the same breath as Virginia Woolf is not as foolhardy as it may seem. Both have a mastery of language, a love of story and a sense of humor that causes readers to swoon for their work.<br />This is hands down the most accomplished novel I have yet read which happens to have a gay love story at its center. And what a gorgeous love story it is. Doyler and Jim are fully-dimensioned, complex and outrageously sexy youths. D.H. Lawrence himself could not have put this much heat into a story.  Or carried it off so well.<br />The depth of this book is astonishing. I've been up all night reading it. I plan to start over and read it again tomorrow. My hat is tipped to the author. May he make many other readers swoon as I have.	2002-05-02

I share at least some of her same passions---the imperial Dusty Springfield and the fiery Aretha Franklin to name just two.  Now Kort has turned her perfect prose to one of the most gifted musician/composers of the last 40 years, Laura Nyro. This book, like Nyro, is soulful and searing and honest and breathtaking. Also like Laura, Kort hits all the right notes.  The section dealing with Nyro almost leaving Clive Davis and Columbia Records for David Geffen's newly-hatched Asylum is hypnotic and ultimately sad.  This book is insightful not just about Laura Nyro but also what the biz part of the music industry was like for a strong-willed, supremely-gifted female.  I know that right now Laura is smiling up there in that great nightclub in the sky.  I can just see her happily passing the single red rose from her piano top to the richly-deserving author of this book.	2002-04-20

Superb	Helen Schulman, in her short stories and wondrous book &quot;The Revisionist&quot;, has delt with romance ending, romance that never happened, romance that caused everlasting pain.  This is the first of her works to deal with a romance that ends in death, and yet doesn't quite.  There are small and troubling and lovely moments in this book.  But much more.<br /><br />Someone innocently asked me this morning, What is the sexiest book you've ever read? This was the easiest question I've ever been asked, perhaps even easier that my own name. &quot;P.S.&quot; is the sexiest book I have ever read. It ranks a notch above &quot;Lolita&quot; and &quot;Lady Chatterly's Lover&quot; in the sensuous sex department because a) there is no guilt nor wheelchaired husbands around and b) an intelligent, ready-for-passion woman is in control.<br />This book is devilish fun! Who wouldn't want to go back to their sexy first lover and woo them all over, this time with wisdom, intellect and wit. &quot;P.S.&quot; is a perfect novel for any season but it is especially wonderful for hot, sticky days on the beach.

Or if Dusty Springfield had written about just how she was able to get that aching soulfulness into &quot;Son of a Preacher Man.&quot; Okay, some of our greatest artists have had the chance and blew it (Aretha, the most revealing singer of all time is the least revealing teller of her own story). Within these pages Paul, Ringo, George and a bit of Yoko give us a big picture window into the life of the greatest pop band of all time. This book is a wonder and a joy.
