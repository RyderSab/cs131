The myth of the rapture continues to earn millions of written pages every year and gains the imagination of millions of believers despite the fact that it belongs in the catagory of fairy tales along with the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.  Then of course, we shouldn't be surprised since many people actually believe one goes to heaven for being a suicide bomber.<br />What misguided historians actually believe humanity has gotten out of the dark ages?  Judging by the persistence of silly myths like the rapture, we're only beginning the renaissance.	2004-05-31

It's hard to believe that educated people believe this nonsense.<br />Let's put two things together and see what we come up with.  First, when bodies are buried, they begin to rot.  Within a few months, a buried body turns to bones.  Second, these bodies are supposed to resurrect to be with Jesus one day when he returns.  Conclusion, rotted bodies are one day going to come out of their graves and float into the sky.  I don't know about you but this sounds like a pretty frightening prospect and would be better described as a revised plot for Night of the Living Dead.	2004-04-29

However, while this revised version does still have the same essential content, it also force feeds you with an overwhealming amount of biblical theology.
