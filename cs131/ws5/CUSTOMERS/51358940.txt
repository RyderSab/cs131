But I would ask you to read this book with a very critical eye because Dick Morris telling Hillary CLinton's story is about as credible as Monica Lewinsky telling Hillary's story. <BR>  He was Bill's friend and confidant, and like Bill, had affairs (most notable was when he was caught by a photographer enflagrante delicto with his mistress on the roof of the Jefferson Hotel in DC having breakfast in his bathrobe). How anyone could believe that his insights are credible escapes me? <BR>  Hate Hillary if you chose, but do so for your own reasons, not based on the beliefs and musings of a man who made his money advising Bill Clinton on how you lie to the American people. This same man (?) now needs to destroy the reputation of his former client's wife to make a buck! Talk about your quintessential media --ore!Caveat emptor!	2004-05-16

She's an heiress and artist, he's a techie and former detective. Their meeting is one of the best introductions (I won't tell you--you need to read it) and their romance is charming.<BR>The fact that she is very rich and well connected and that he is the &quot;commoner&quot; is a great twist on the romance novels that tend to view Blacks as not having wealthy well-connected people in their racial group. It is fun to read how the author constructs the scene at the society ball that she takes Brian to.<BR>This is one that I know that you will enjoy.	2003-07-09

While the other reviewers gave you excellent details of the story, I just want to give you the reasons why it is one of the better ones in this genre.<BR>I liked it because  Henrico was romantic and persistent when it came to his love for Jacqueline, but the author also gave us a sense of his innocence with regards to the obstacles that they would face as an interracial couple. On the other hand, Jacqueline was clear about those issues and eventually recognizes her ability to love him regardless of his race and to stand up to those who could not deal with their relationship.<BR>The author dealt with these issues, but not to the extent that they distracted you from the romance of the story. A cruise, a chance meeting between a beautiful woman and and wealthy knock-out of a man...how could this miss? It is a charming evening's read. I highly recommend it.	2003-07-09

Seressia is one of my favorite authors in the interracial romance category and I am so glad that she has come out with this book.<BR>Maya and Nick are next door neighbors who have never really had much contact until his nanny has an accident, doesn't show up and Maya comes home from work and sees his eight year old daughter, Taylor, soaking wet and sitting on the porch in the rain. She contacts Nick ( a surgeon) through his answering service and that's when the real action begins.<BR>Initially miffed at him for letting Taylor sit out in the rain, Maya chides him for not having his cell phone on or at least keeping his battery charged. He, on the other hand, is really nervous about Taylor being over Maya's house when he doesn't really know her, but he has not choice than to trust her until he can get home from the hospital. However, once he gets to her house, looks at Maya, sees Taylor's response to her and eats a great home cooked meal by this children's software developer, he's hooked.<BR>They both face demons from their past marriages and the inevitable problems of an interracial couple trying to live their lives in a world that still has a few racist [people]. But, the author has tons of great subplots like Maya's mixed heritage, Nick's racist mother, the princess club and passion that keep you reading it until the happy ending! I think that you'll like this one.	2003-06-06

An interracial romance that has two gorgeous, savvy, independently wealthy people that are made for each other and are passionate!<BR> Yvonne and Mike are thrown together because a mutual friend is unable to pick Yvonne up from the airport and asks Mike to stand in for him. She expects her friend and Mike doesn't know who he is looking for other than her name. When they do meet up, their attraction is mutual and that's when the fun begins.<BR> I won't tell you anymore because I don't want to spoil the your fun, but I will guarantee that you will not be disappointed if you buy this one. One of my favorite parts is when Mike invites her over for dinner and his parents are there and Yvonne doesn't know it, nor do his parents know that she is Black. The dialogue and interaction are really charming.<BR> This is one of the best of this genre that I have read and I have read them all! I guess that I should also add that it has serious moments, but they aren't overly grim. Don't lend this one out, you'll read it again and again.	2003-04-30

But if, like me, you can also enjoy a romance novel that is in short story form about a white male lawyer and a black pediatric nurse whose lives become linked because of a mistake at the sperm bank, this book is for you!<BR> While I won't go in to great detail about the story (because the other reviewers have done this extremely well) briefly, instead of donating to the blood bank, like most of his colleagues at the law firm are doing, Nigel starts to contemplate the inconvenience of doing this and decides that he will donate...but to a sperm bank. Meanwhile, Qiana hears her biological time clock ticking and her useless boyfriend is not making any commitment to their relationship so she decides that she wants a baby and also decides to get rid of his cheating behind and go to the sperm bank. Little do either of the protagonists know that a mix-up at the sperm bank will have Nigel unable to reclaim his sperm after being told that this is probably a bad idea and Qiana conceiving a baby by a white man.<BR> Suffice it to say that this leads to twists and turns in the characters' lives and the lives of their friends, families and foes! The author does a great job, in this very short format, of describing the characters and making the dialogue fun and easy to read.<BR> It won't take you more than a few hours (at most) to read and I think that you will enjoy it.	2003-04-18

The Duke accepted his stepson and gave him his title, but can't quite forgive his wife for her indiscretion. So they have lived in a strained marriage for years. The old Duke decides that the only way to make sure his bloodline continues is by forcing his stepson to marry this unseen daughter (a teacher at a convent with very independent attitudes) if the young Duke wants to keep his inheritance. He tells his shocked and angry son the circumstances of his birth then goes to visit his daughter who is equally shocked and angry. Of course, they agree to this marriage of convenience and that's where the story of the romance begins in earnest despite their best attempts to avoid falling in love. Although a bit tedious, at times, this is a fine romance!	2001-03-28

Why this is not written about more often, is the tragedy of living in a society that panders to the ideas of the past that has never came to grips with the realities of what people really were (and area) doing.

The first book of this trilogy captured my imagination with the use of the ghosts and legend and their impact on the main charaters' lives, but with each of the successive books, the story got weaker and weaker.  I can't get a handle on my dismay with this book, but suffice it to say that when I finished, all I could say was to my friends and fellow romance readers, &quot;Oh well -- whatever.&quot; Not my usual, &quot;you've gotta buy this one!&quot; Trust me, you can wait to borrow it from a friend.	2001-02-20

She tells this guy more than she does her husband when they are in med school, she takes a job after her residency in the same hospital that he works -- having kept in contact with him over the years by long distance telephone calls that went on for hours.

Amazon has accurately summed up the plot for you, I just want to say that as one of her biggest fans (I've read ALL of her books), I was extremely disappointed. It lacked passion until almost the very end. The dialogue was  bland and the former tomboy's metamorphis in to a beautiful lady  (considering how she supposedly lived all her life) was not very  convincing.

Meg, the heroine, went from being a free thinking, independent,and passionate woman  with Prince Jean-Marc one moment, to a &quot;wimp&quot; with others who  were either downright rude or demanding the next. I thought that Cameron  couldn't decide who she wanted as her villian and so one minute it was the  ghost. The next it was the prince's rude mistress, and yet another time it  was her distant male cousin. I believe that romance books should leave me  wanting to rush out and buy the author's next novel. I believe that romance  novels are a neat past time that entertain better than TV and should make  you cry a little and smile alot. This one just made me tired!	2000-04-01
