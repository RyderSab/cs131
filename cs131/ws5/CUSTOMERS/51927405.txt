I received this gift from an art gallery owner after making the oft-handed remark that the Old Masters were too representational in their art and today would be replaced by cameras. And that modern artists, though rarely having the same technical prowess, nonetheless are interpretive in their work and thus more intellectually challenging and provocative.  Well -- ahem -- this book demonstrates the narrative in the work of an Old Master and never have I been so happy to have made too much a sweeping generalization before.<br />Clever, imaginative, believable, insightful and educational ... the adjectives that most novels strive for but few seldom achieve. Chevalier fills in the blanks of a painting who's mystery and allure is second only to the Mona Lisa. Told from the subject's perspective, you'll gather an appreciation for the true soul of a great painting - the human interest stories that go on behind it, as well as the artist's techniques that bring it to life. <br />A great book for yourself and for someone as a gift! It's just about impossible not to be drawn in and engaged by this book.	2002-12-28

And in this book the author provides a thorough, informative and stimulating analysis of the Frank Stella &quot;Moby Dick&quot; series wherein Stella produced at least one interpretive art piece for every chapter of Herman Melville's classic novel.  This is probably the most insightful description I have read for how a modern, abstract artist goes about putting his pieces together, what the artist is thinking, what the artist is attempting to communicate and how those thoughts are reflected in the abstract lines, shapes, colors and symbols.  I have to admit that at times I didn't get all of the points that the author was making however this is to be expected when providing analysis of an abstract artist's interpretation of a challenging novel like Moby Dick.  All in all, a must read for lovers of great fiction and/or modern art.	2002-01-10

But I will point out one aspect that warrants additional emphasis, the books characters.<br />The characters are so real in this novel they could walk right out of the book and you could talk to them.  Dostoyevsky's style is to have his characters enter into a scene and immediately spill out everything that's on their mind without edit.  It's a bit awkward but it's also what makes them more real than any author has ever been able to achieve.  And not only are they revealing they're also an eerie representation of the people one encounters in one's real life -- you will be able to identify each character in the book with a real person in your life.<br />If I could only put one book on a &quot;required reading&quot; list this could very well be it.  (Moby Dick would be my other choice.)<br />The publisher also did an excellent job on the translation, keeping it as close as possible to the original Russian meaning.	2000-11-09

Melville points out to us what at some repressed level we all know yet won't allow to occupy our psyche's:  that our world is a dangerous and mysterious place where evil masquerades  as good. Melville was so far ahead of his time on so many issues like  racism, the environment and slavery that it's no wonder he died broke like  other tormented visionaries like Van Gogh. Melville's style makes it a  tough and challenging read, no doubt, but it all works to deliver one  profound and critical message after another. A must read if there is one.	2000-04-13

Accomplishing the above in a small  book the size of a cd that you can read in one airline flight is pretty  impressive.

However, in his attempt to marry his love of war history with lessons for business management, he scores few victories.

However, he fails to tie it in effectively with the then business world  analogy he tries to conclude each chapter with. The reader is then left  scratching one's head wondering how one can employ this in one's business  which, after all, is what one is supposed to be taking from this book in  the first place.	2000-02-17
