US	37202433	R235FJMEA9TYMB	0515090654	553735563	Twice Loved	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Unique and Incredible	Spencer writes a different story every time--that's what I love about her.  Or should I be speaking in past tense--loved about her.  She never wrote sequels.  What she does is quite unique.  She writes a story surrounding the journey of two people's relationship from the time they meet--through the conflict--and on to the ever necessary happy ending. <br /> <br />In this one, the happy ending comes, but not without the tears and pain.  How she manages this is heart wrenching.  Yes, I was a bit bugged by Laura for not standing up for her feelings and for staying with Dan out of gratitude, but as you read, you tend to put yourself in her position and wonder what you would do and how you would feel.  *SPOILER* Her child loved one man as his father.  How can you tear apart father and son?  But then again, how can you keep another man from ever knowing the love of his child?  A painful decision. <br /> <br />This is one to be read again and again and again. How you come to love both men will make you cry out of anquish and joy. <br />	2005-05-20

I'm not a prude and I want intimate scenes in my romance novels, but basically the sex begins on page 60 and continues on every other page until the end at page 287.  If you're going to write erotic romance, then market yourself under that genre. <br /> <br />The sex was incredible, the story uninteresting. And at $14 a pop, I don't think I'll be giving her a second chance.	2005-03-30

This is one of Lorraine Heath's early works that has you laughing, crying and just plain loving it.  Every moment in this book is heartfelt and touching.

I can't believe I had it in my house for a week before picking it up.  Normally, I'm not a fan of contemporaries, but Beth Ciotta has changed that opinion! <br /> <br />It really was a funny and fast paced book.  The mix of characters and their traits blended so well.  They all took on such a real persona that I feel as if they truly are alive.  The appearance of the characters from her previous book, \\"Jinxed,\\" blended so well and didn't feel forced on to the page.  It was so much fun to see them again. <br /> <br />This is definitely one that has been happily added to my keeper shelf!	2005-02-01

Perfect in his physique, his style, intelligence, coloring, he always said the right thing and loved her with no doubt in his mind or yours.  Judith Ivory wove a very different tale from your usual romance novel.  This book read like a waltz.  I dropped 1/2 a star for the quickie ending, but I've found that to be somewhat of an Ivory trademark.  She spends so much time on telling the story in such depth, that she suddenly faces a deadline and nears what should be the last page and she rushes to just settle the conflict quickly and neatly.  I'm no expert, but if Ivory could get around that problem, she'd be a keeper in my book. <br /> <br />That being said, I still highly recommend Sleeping Beauty.	2005-01-27

Their sightless embraces were breathtaking, their darkened relationship, perfection.  But in the light of day, Louise never comes to love her beast.  She was supposed to love this man given all his flaws and hideous scars and up until the very end of the story, the reader never feels that love (nor does he, I might add).  She's so busy putting him down, refusing his touch and criticizing his disability (if you can believe that one!) <br /> <br />There were actually little secrets that only her and her mysterious lover would recognize....the black pearls, the scent of his soap, his accent when he spoke English.....and not one of them reappeared to give her hints as to who he really was--except for the pearls, which she rips off her body in a torrent of tears for they bring her lover to mind. <br />Basically, she's in love with her mysterious man for more than 3/4's of the book.  She doesn't love the beast until literally the last page--good for him, bad for us.	2005-01-23

She brings you into a story from moment one and leads you through the next 6 months or so of a person's life with no detail left unturned. <br /> <br />Lee and Sam meet on a business trip in a very funny way and their relationship takes off.  Spencer fills you in on the details of their life, their homes, their jobs and their relationship unlike any other writer I've ever read.  I adore reading her books.  This one is set in the early 80's and is so precise in it's decor and style of that genre.  The intmacy is hot yet done in the classy style of Spencer and appears at all the right times.  Not too much, not too little. <br /> <br />Again, she takes all the right elements and blends them together the way we want to read it. <br /> <br />Buy this book.  It's definitely re-read material. <br />	2005-01-20

I cannot find the words to express how beautifully this story unfolded on paper.  It was so enjoyable from start to finish.  You were enraptured by the love between Gabrielle and Max and you were captured by the endearing supporting cast.    Ms. Williamson had just the right blend of weaving a love story into such an interesting period in French history.  The intimacy between the two main characters was far greater than anything I've ever read by her before.  Usually, she tends to introduce a love scene and then leave things to the imagination.  Not so in this book.  The intimacy was constant and such a great part of the unveiling of their love and the glue to their relationship.    I would highly recommend finding this one and holding on to it.	2005-01-14

He says yes with no hesitation--it made you think they were going to be someone important in his life rather than just 2 hired men.  One day into the trip, the men screw up and Tanner questions their reliability--a little too late, huh?  Meanwhile, they were hired to guard $50,000 for 3 months.  That's a big responsibility.    The description of the hero and heroine really bothered me.  Tanner is described as having reddish brown hair with a craggy face.  Fox gets part of her ear chopped off in a shoot out.  It's referred to again and again how she's missing a chunk of her ear lobe.    When they become intimate, he takes off her sweaty, filthy, leather boots that she's been wearing for probably years at at time and sucks on her toes.....what a pleasant thought.  Their next love scene involves the feet again.  Gross.    She's a hard headed guide who's dedicated to her work and getting them quickly and safely to Denver.  Midway through the book the 2 main characters become involved intimately and now that's all she thinks about and talks about.  They've completely become lax in guarding the money and go off into the woods to be alone while leaving the guards (one of whom was robbed once already, and the other whose honesty was doubted from the start) with Peaches, an elderly sick man.  Need I say more?    Maggie Osborne is now 0 for 3 on my scorecard.  The last 3 books she's written have fallen way short of the keeper category for me.	2004-12-01

There weren't any obstacles other than the unspoken secret from her past.  The couple came together without any hinderences and floated beyond her secret when it was exposed.  The obstacle that came at the end of the story was unexpected and unneccessary, yet the book still had a charming ending. <br />I thoroughly enjoyed it and will go on to read more from Jillian Hart.	2004-11-14

The nephew takes his place as lord of the manor never knowing that the property came with wards of his uncle as they have since moved into town where Caro begins her search as a common worker to support her family. <br /> <br />Kit tries to take them all back to provide for them, but Caroline is stubborn and won't reduce herself to accept charity ever again.  In the meantime, her brothers come to love Kit and make it hard for Caro to continue hating a man she doesn't even really know. <br /> <br />What ensues is a charming story with wonderfully developed characters in a regency setting.  You will come to love everyone as if you have known them forever.  The young boys are adorable, Caroline is beautiful and proud and Kit is the perfect hero with vulnerabilities and strengths.  His need for a family and the role he plays in the lives of the young boys is exquisite.  I read the entire book with a smile on my face and at times I was laughing out loud.  I'm so happy to have found the writings of Elizabeth Mansfield.	2004-11-14

Emma Holly made a clean sweep in the last chapters of a very dark, sensual and erotic tale.  Their relationship was secretative and the story primarily focused on them.....which is a good thing.  Near the end, Emma Holly felt the need to close all of the ties with his family and her family and we just didn't care about either of the two.  We wanted to see Merry and Nicholas form their final bond and go out with the focus on them as it was during the whole book. <br /> <br />I would recommend this for lovers of romance.  Yes, the intimacy is a little on the hot side, but it was well written, and classically delivered. <br /> <br />	2004-09-28

The sex was just thrown in here and there to allow for the erotica labeling. The brother was adorable and should have been the hero of the story rather than the randy little homosexual black sheep of the family. <br />  <br />There truly was no storyline to follow.  Every page was her coming out in English society and being stalked by the hero.  Until the end, of course....happily ever after my friends...happily ever after.	2004-09-28

I couldn't go much further after the heroine kissed her best friend before she kissed the hero of the story. And did I mention her best friend was NOT A GUY.  How weird is that? <br /> <br />Also, don't even bother reading the jackets of Crusie's books.

It's a great ensemble cast and you really will enjoy each story that's going on within. It seems to be Crusie's trademark to have strong secondary stories alongside her main characters. <br />  <br /> However, Crusie tries so hard to have the style, wit and cool of Sex in the City type characters. In my opinion, she doesn't make it. Her love scenes border on vulgar and her girlfriend talk tends to be over the top. Every scene of intimacy was discussed the next day with Quinn and her sister or her best friend or even with Nick himself. And those conversations were just too in-depth for me. I think I'd be embarassed to discuss my love life in detail. While I talk with my friends about anything, there's just some things you don't need to say. Get the picture? <br />  <br /> Read the book: You will laugh, cheer, cringe and laugh again.	2004-07-24

The book was adorable for about the first 10 chapters....then it's a spiraling descent into stupidity and repetition that could only end when one throws the book against the nearest wall.  At first the story was witty and the characters so true-to-life.  The one liners had me laughing out loud.  I loved the heroine and rooted for her all the way.  Then suddenly it all went wrong.  The one-liners became annoying and the focus of the story went off course.  Crusie writes with the sole purpose of creating a life her secondary characters...which boggles my mind.  The story was then focused on Min's sister and her wedding.  The main characters' relationship was never fully developed and Min went from being lovable to obnoxious.  Cal developed into a pathetic guy with a puppy dog mentality of \\"I like big women.\\"  The constant, and I do mean constant, references to Min's weight were unnecessary.  You loved her from the start for who she was, not what she looked like.    Oh, and did I mention the constant advertising for Krispy Kreme donuts? Chicken Marsala? Elvis Costello? Julia Roberts?  Did I mention the jokes and the food references getting old?  Again and again?    And one more thing, the bet was the most confusing plot I've ever read.  I've never heard of someone losing a $10,000 bet and chasing after the winner with  a check to pay him off.  If I had lost that big a bet, I'd change my phone number and stay out of sight.	2004-06-29

It's a western.  It was marketed to the wrong people.  We wanted to see them fall in love....not hear about it.  We wanted her to melt in his arms when she saw the undying love in his eyes and in his voice.  Texas was one of the best heroes I've ever read...he was vulnerable and so in love with her yet she could care less, until the last chapter, of course. Pretty weak ending but I must say the characters were well written and the story unique.  Read at your own risk, depending on what you're looking for.	2004-05-23

There was no need to explore the mystery going on in town.  We could have focused entirely on Eliza and Aaron and been just as happy.  There was more than enough with the brothers' love triangle to keep us satisfied.  The author really screwed up the last few chapters with the feeling that the epiloque was from a whole 'nother story.  Where did that come from??<br />Anyway.....I read it straight through with the hopes that I would love it till the last page.  No such luck.	2004-05-21

She wrote the perfect corporate type characters that reeked of money and a &quot;business first&quot; mindset.<br />I thought the secondary romance throughout the story was a let down.  I really wanted to see something happen with Holt and Faith.  It was left to our imagination.  I felt the author did a great two-step with both sets of characters.  She went from chapter to chapter with each love story and it was refreshing to come back to them.  I was as captivated by Holt as I was by Pendleton.  All in all it was a fun read with realistic, vulnerable people.	2004-05-18

Not once did I question a sentence, a word, an emotion, an action.  This book read like poetry.  It was intriguing from start to finish.  We were taken on a coaster ride through the cold, dark world of a madman and the cold, dark streets of nineteenth century Greenwhich Village.<br />This was a captivating read and definitely worth more than its 5 star status.	2004-05-18

Karyn Monk has such potential but I don't think she knows what type of book she wants to write.  Her writing is far more intelligent than some other writers, but she needs to entwine that intelligence with a romantic plot.  She strays from what the romance reader wants to read. I wouldn't recommend this one for fans of the romance genre.	2004-04-26

Basically, what I'm saying is that I can't give this a rave review as everyone else has.  If you're looking for a great romance novel--this is not it.  It's basically a cop drama with some sex scenes thrown in--which, by the way, I must say Ms. Albert writes very well.<br />The story had such potential but it never went anywhere as far as their relationship was concerned.  As for the drama unfolding regarding the theft of some highly precious japanese art--that was written in detail from beginning to end.  I also had a problem with the descriptions of the main characters.  At first, she wrote of clothing as if they were in the 80's--(a swing coat?  I wore one in 1984).  Then I start reading about cell phones and how they stake out a retro 80's club so I know it's setting is closer to today.  Minor stuff, but it matters.<br />Having said all of the above, the hero was great and I would have loved to see more enfold with the 2 of them.  Unfortunately, Ms Albert felt the need to introduce us to the entire police force and an array of criminals and their personal problems.  I also felt that the heroine was a little too angry and then all of a sudden...bam!...she comes around to a softer side.  I did finish the book which says a lot, but it's definitely not a keeper for me.	2004-04-20

I so loved her previous stuff that I can't believe this was written by the same author.  I cringed while reading the dumb jokes that fell flat and was annoyed by the sappy secondary characters who had way too much time on the page.  I knew more about the heroine's sister than the heroine.....and I cared more about Dixie's deceased husband than I did about Jack Parrish.  And as for Jack Parrish, he was a man who carried a deep hurt, but the author never allowed him to get over it and start again.  Jack was as angry as if his girlfriend had left him yesterday, but for cryin out loud, 15 YEARS HAD GONE BY!  And he was mean ...without even knowing yet that his son was kept away from him all this time!<br />This was not Rachel Gibson material.  Do not, repeat, DO NOT buy this book.  Don't even borrow it!  Hopefully, Rachel Gibson will get over this small writing crisis she's having and pull through on the next one.  I have the faith she can do it!	2004-03-04

Their chemistry was right, the setting was right and the characters were well written...stereotypical yet believable.  While they were stranded, it was perfect.  Once they were saved, I really forgot to pick the book up everytime I put it down.<br />Near the end of the story we were given such great dialogue as...\\"shut up!\\" and \\"your idea sucks and so does your daughter!\\"  Hmmm, wouldn't I love to meet a man who talks like that?  All in all the book served its purpose; and that being just a light, quick read to pass the time.

Let's begin with the startling differences between the hero and heroine.  He was gorgeous, sexy, loving, vulnerable, tortured and sweet as anything.  She was......what was she again?....I don't remember because she was so boring.  She was vanilla.  She was almost non-existant on the page.  Why he fell so in love with her was a mystery to me.  The heroine could have been written in a much more complex way and added so much more to the relationship and the plot.  It was almost as if the hero and heroine were written by two different writers rather than the same author.<br />And the ridiculously annoying secondary characters and their lack of contribution to the heart of the whole torutured story of this young man's life was almost pathetic.  Why was her sister's lesbian relationship even mentioned? And the young boy he saves at \\"SAFE HOUSE\\" and \\"BERNICE VILLAGE\\" was like scenes out of an ABC Afterschool Special.  And yes, needless to say the ending was clean, simple, and happily ever after like some bad movie of the week.  I mean, literally, bad.  After this whole dark, tortured life of this man who is raped and battered, they end the book with him planning the guest list for his wedding?  Of course everyone from SAFE HOUSE was invited.

Generally, I'm a fan of romantic fiction, but I gave this a shot based on a recommendation from a friend.  Truly did not regret it.  At first I thought it was too long, but once I started I couldn't stop.  It sucks you in and makes you feel like you're on that cattle drive.  The fate of some of the characters makes you think you've lost someone you actually know.<BR>If you read only one book this year, make it be this one.	2003-11-24

I didn't enjoy her 2 previous books and I simply could not even finish this one.  There's isn't anything to like about this couple and the heroine is so confusing....is she independant?...is she a spinster?...is she in love with this bank robber?  And the darn bank robber had more time on the page than the main characters.  There's no romance, no desire, no spark between anyone in this book AT ALL.  <br />Oh and can someone tell me why it's being called a great western?  Is it because the sheriff rides a horse?  There is no reference to a time period in this story and Maggie Osborne's unique style of research is completely non-existent.  What a disappointment.	2003-11-19

Her storylines are unique and her characters well defined.  The story was a little slow at first and I was unsure of the whole connection of the main characters, but once you get past that, it's perfect.  The hero is a proud man with vulnerabilities that will tear your heart out.  Her scenes of intimacy are as hot as always and show up at just the right time.<br />Buy this one because you WILL read it again and again.	2003-11-18

You felt as if you were on that mountain top and you felt the  cold right along with them.  The scenery and the history behind the story and the mountain climbing was a special addition to her tales as her research always is.  The hero/heroine had a beautiful relationship that you yearned for throughout the story.  I still feel that Taming the Heiress was the best of the trilogy, but this comes a close second.	2003-11-12

It was refreshing not to have Miss Independance like in every other romance novel that's afraid to be that stereotypical damsel in distress.  That having been said, I enjoyed the story and the time they spent alone on the yacht, but then when they got back home I just didn't see what was actually keeping them apart..his top secret job?<br />It wasn't the best by Rachel Gibson, but it's a fun, light read.	2003-11-06

There was no chemistry between the h/h the way there was in See Jane Score and True Confessions.  And as for their daughter, she was the sterotypical annoying kid who talks baby talk even though she's seven years old.

Even the book jacket didn't really tell you what the story was about.  I kept waiting for the story to start and I was well into the middle of the book by then.   Also, I'm so unimpressed with these trilogies that authors keep putting out.  Aedan didn't impress me in Taming the Heiress and Dougal and Meg were just forced onto the pages of Waking the Princess.  What's wrong with starting over with all new characters nowadays???  Everyone seems to be doing it and it's nothing but a distraction to me.  Sorry to say that Ms. King let me down a little this time, although her writing is still far superior than so many others out there.	2003-10-02

McNaught wasted a lot of words with other story lines before getting to Julie and Zack.  She went into their personal lives as children which was sooo unneccesary.  And her portrayal of Julie as a tough street kid who hotwired cars at 11 years old was just ridiculous.  She wrote in a lot of other people who we just didn't care about.  She gave way too much time to the heroine's teaching career and those drippy, boring kids that she taught.  McNaught never closed a lot of the stories that she opened because there were way too many to follow.<BR>All of that having been said, the romance between the 2 main characters was perfect.  Their time alone was perfect.  And I just wish the whole book could have been about them instead of everyone else.  I will also say that the ending was a little disappointing.  Julie does something near the end that makes us hate her and unfortunately, the author never fully rectifies it and doesn't allow enough time for us, the readers, to truly forgive her.	2003-09-29

The story got away from her and she seemed to have struggled with what she really wanted the story to be about.  It never seemed to end.  There wasn't any intimacy beyond kissing--which means that the hero/heroine never really built their relationship.  Believe me the story was not about him and her.  It was about her and her mother and her half-sister whom her father (the pirate) had sent her to live with in England.  The hero of the story is almost non-existent for such a long period of time.  The poignancy of the story was about this young girl fitting into London society and earning the love of her mother who walked out of her life at birth.  Believe it or not, the book turns into an action thiller with the heroine being kidnapped.  That is where Ms. Osborne shows her own confusion in where this plot is going.<BR>I wouldn't recommend this one - but I would highly recommend another early Maggie Osborne novel called &quot;Emerald Rain.&quot;  It shines in comparison and truly shows Ms. Osborne's expertise.	2003-09-25
US	37202433	RDKO2IYO4HWYJ	0451407520	236841738	Texas Destiny	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Perfect........	It's really amazing to read a list of reviews and not find one bad comment among them.  The worst I read was that it wasn't hot enough.  I actually thought that the one love scene that was written in was extremely hot.  The love that was portrayed between these two people was breathtaking.  When they parted the first time, I was in tears.  He was an extension of her and she of him.  They were best friends and that was the beauty of their love scenes.  I highly recommend this book as does every other reviewer on this page.  This is by far Lorraine Heath's biggest accomplishment as a writer.  Nothing she has written beyond this novel can compare.  She does go on to write the story of the other Leigh brothers, but they just don't melt your heart the way Houston Leigh does.<BR>Find this book and buy it.  I know it will one day be re-released because it definitely deserves it.	2003-09-09

There's a surprise ending that will take your breath away.  The love scenes are perfect.  The book is primarily about the journey they take after she is captured.  That, in my opinion, is exactly what you want in a romance novel: time alone with just him and her.  Believe it or not, this is the only Judith E. French novel that I own.  I have tried her other stuff, but she just never came close to writing like this again, IMHO.  Buy this, read it and enjoy.	2003-09-09

The hero is vulnerable and in need of love but you would never know it because he hides it so well.  This is the gift of Lorraine Heath's pen.  She did it with this book and her &quot;Always to Remember&quot; and &quot;Texas Destiny.&quot;  The main male leads of these three novels are written to perfection.  They need the love of the heroine in each story, but they are proud and determined not to show it.  How they break down the walls they built around themselves is heart wrenching.  It will melt your heart.  You will cry and you will re-read these 3 books again and again.  <BR>Find them, buy them and enjoy them for years to come.	2003-09-09

She knows her characters and writes of them as if she is the actress portraying the part.  She must have used a model for this heroine, because she wrote a little too close to home about the typical red head, fair skinned woman and her personal problems with blushing, sun burn and frizzy hair syndrome.  All in all, the characters were perfect, the setting was perfect and like I said, you really felt you were in their lives.  Spencer is a very descriptive writer and researches her settings in depth no matter how simple the setting.  This one really brings you into the typical American home in the late 70's/early 80's. <BR>As for the Freed book, it was pathetic to compare her to Spencer.  There is no comparison.  Freed started out with a great concept and went off in the strangest direction.  Two chapters into the book and they're getting mugged in a latino ghetto?  Huh?  What did that have to do with anything?  Just bring the hero and heroine together in any light and stay there.  That's what LS does so perfectly.  She writes a romantic story about 2 people.  She doesn't stray from them.  I put the book down at that part and would have thrown it away if it weren't for the fact that it was my only copy of Sweet Memories.  <BR>Jan Freed should try READING a Spencer novel before she attempts to share a book jacket.  If I were LaVyrle, I'd sue the publisher!!	2003-09-06

She showed no loyalty and slept with his best friend.  I think I counted 19 people dying in the story.  Everyone dies: her father, his brother, his father, his mother, his child, his patient, his wife's 5 miscarriages.  Yikes!  Oh and get this:  they haven't seen each other in 10 years.  When they finally get back together, she gets a stomach virus and gets sick.  So much for a moving love story.  <BR>The author had no direction and no focus.  There was far too much going on with other characters and their previous lives.  The ending was as disappointing as the stomach virus.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.	2003-09-06

It was a powerful book with a powerful relationship. For some reason, Ms. Ranney felt the need to end the story with focus on the MacRae family rather than on the hero and heroine whose story this was. The ending wasn't solid and left doubt in your mind. Ms. Ranney's descriptive scenes of intimacy are as beautiful as always; I would recommend reading it, but be prepared for a weak ending.	2003-08-13

Her writing is intelligent, touching and humorous.  She brings the characters together constantly throughout the book...which is what we all want.  Ms. King's lead male characters are always the right blend of strength, beauty, intelligence and vulnerability.  I enjoy her work right along with Madeline Hunter.  They're both 2 of the best writers in the business today.	2003-07-28

The story was lacking in quotation marks - meaning....THERE WAS NO DIALOGUE!  All we did was hear about what this one thinks and what that one thinks and we were force fed the story from her 'Rogue in Texas' book.  All of the characters from Rogue were unnecessarily brought onto these pages.  I felt it would have been quite confusing to a reader who had not read Rogue.  Had I not known that story, I would have shut the book and taken 2 aspirin from the confusion that ensued by this explanation.  It makes you think that perhaps Ms. Heath has nothing up her sleeve anymore and needs to constantly draw from other story lines.  I, for one, am sick of the Englishman in Texas story.<br />I truly thought I had found a great author in Ms. Heath after reading Texas Destiny.  Unfortunately, everything written after Texas Destiny has appeared to me like she's just being forced to put out these books and they're selling based on the merit of her early work.  <BR>'Always to Remember' and 'Sweet Lullaby' are NOT to be missed.  They are incredible stories with heart wrenching love scenes.  How they were written by the same author as 'Love with a Scandalous Lord' is a mystery.  Again, I think Ms. Heath is under the influence of her publishers.  The book jacket is embarassing and the synopsis does not tell the true story written.	2003-07-26

It had absoulutely no reference to the period in which it was set.  I felt as if I were reading a contemporary novel because of the way that people spoke.  The dialogue just wasn't written the way people spoke and thought in 1871. The jacket told of a charming story about Kyle and Amelia.  If only that story had followed through into the book.  For instance, the best friend from law school and the brother and the mother and the best friend's stepmother who slept with the main character(blah, blah, blah) had way too much time on the pages.<br />I bought the book because Ms. Lindstrom was compared to LaVyrle Spencer - believe me, there's no comparison.
