Although there are better introductory guides to meditation available parents looking for a book to share with their teenaged kids would be well served starting with this one.	2005-08-09

Some of the short stories are so imaginative and well-executed that Palahniuk easily could've fleshed out 8 or 9 terrific novels out of them if had chosen to do so.  Ultimately, because of the high quality of the short stories, the mediocre main storyline becomes tolerable as a framework in placing the short stories within a narrative context.  Definitely recommended for fans of Palahniuk and for those who appreciate a bristling, crackling yarn or two.	2005-07-19

For starters, the artwork by Zulli, Muth and Vess is some of the best that the series has seen and the return of characters, large and small, provides a satisfying sense of finality and closure that one would expect from a flagship series as this.	2005-04-08

Unfortunately, the meat of the book is less satisfying as readers are presented with a meandering, sometimes incoherent, pastiche of political rants and allegorical vignettes of Sept. 11 and its aftermath that otherwise distracts from some artfully drawn and arranged color panels from Spiegelman.  Keep in mind that those who are looking for tightly constructed narrative and pacing as seen in 'Maus' may be surprised at the complete shift in style and tone found here.  The good news is that most readers will be able to absorb the book in its entirety within 30 minutes so for those who are curious go ahead and give it a try - your reading-time investement will certainly be minimal.	2005-01-04

If this is the type of book you're expecting, then you're best forewarned that out of the 230 pages or so, its not until the last half of the book that the story finally shifts to Afghanistan and once there we're treated to a single first hand account of frontline combat that results in one Taliban KIA.  As far as action goes that's pretty much it and author, Andrew Exum, gets as much mileage out of this single incident as he can muster in that the final third of the book deals with musings on what it is to kill a man in time of war and recollections of the ensuing 'media barrage' that makes him a hometown celebrity after articles of his units battle makes publication in the Army newspaper, amongst others.  While the book is of mild interest as a memoir on the makings of an Infantry officer in today's military methinks that the reading public would've been better served if the dish on the menu actually resembled what is ultimately served on the table.  If page after page of razor sharp prose recollecting the heat of combat is what you're after then its safe to say that your reading time would best be spent elsewhere.	2004-11-25

Scattered throughout the 140 pages or so is a stunning collection of photographs and prints capturing the colorful majesty of America's, \\"city by the bay.\\"  Accompanying these artworks are snippets of prose by writers ranging from Mark Twain to William Gibson, ruminating on the various charms and quirks of the foggy city.  The best prose snippet comes from William Saroyan as he recollects an eye-opening collection of sights and sounds as he visits the 1915 World's Fair as a young boy travelling with a group of fellow orphans.  All in all a nice book for anyone with an appreciation for all the charms that San Francisco has to offer.	2004-11-18

While the content itself is over a dozen years old the book still manages to read as if it were published weeks ago with the bulk of its subject matter covering George Bush (Sr.), Iraq and Sadaam Hussein, big government and the warped skewering of 'news' by media broadcasters/publishers/advertisers.  While the book will entertain with its razor-sharp aesthetic of sarcasm and political commentary it is somewhat unsettling when realizing how little things have changed since this book was first published.	2004-11-15

And thus begins a full fledged war spanning the eternal length of time during Junior High and High School where Ted Rall learns to be a man, standing up for himself and exacting due punishment to those who strike at him, consequences be damned.  At times, laugh out loud funny, this book will also shock in reminding you how brutal kids/teens can be to one another - the physical cruelty that Ted and Brian exact on one another is frightening in its murderous intent but just past that initial layer of shock comes a somewhat disturbing reminder of the cruelties adolescents face as they transition to adulthood.	2004-11-04

Unless you're a die-hard Jay Mohr fan, you're probablly picking this one up because you're interested in the behind the scenes dish and dirt at SNL which this book does indeed offer albeit in somewhat small doses.  The most interesting portions of this book aren't necessarily the celebrity and SNL cast gossip but rather the creative process that take place prior to the live broadcasts of the show - the sketch pitch sessions, the collaboration between writers, the rehearsal and walk-through process that would ultimately flesh out the show, etc.  The chief complaint of this book would be its lack of structure as Jay will start a chapter seemingly on a specific subject and then suddenly drift into tangents that drift all over the place.  By the end of it all you will be slightly entertained but left wishing for better overall editing to keep the book's focus intact.	2004-10-20

In Volume #1, The Lucky Road, readers are introduced to the series' protagonist, Jain, as she looks to escape her past and start anew in a castle populated with whimsical characters both human and animal alike.  While Medley's black and white art does little in the way of stylistic expression, it is perfectly suited to convey her simple and somewhat predictable storyline.  On the whole, this series doesn't contain much 'wow' factor by way of story or art but nevertheless the charming characters and sugary storyline lends itself to an entertaining afternoons worth of reading.	2004-09-30

The first 3/4's of this book, \\"The Adventures of Big Johnson Bone, Frontier Hero,\\" delves into the story of the founder of Boneville and how he came to establish his trading post on the Rolling Bone river.  Drawn by Jeff Smith, this story looks great but suffers in pacing and tone as it is written by Tom Sniegoski.  The last 1/4 of the book deals with a young pig and other assorted forest animals in, 'Riblet,' a very forgettable segment that most readers could easily do without.	2004-09-23

With that being said, fans of horror-fiction will revel at Lebbon's ability to conjure up highly imaginative storylines, in the vein of Koontz, with a stronger post-apocalyptic bent.  Briskly plotted and at times - elegantly written, this is a hard paperback to put down and will have you completely absorbed from the first several pages.

Ultimately though the most entertaining portions of the book are the beginning and ending chapters that serve as mini biographies and a study of remarkable contrasts on the Mariner's Ichiro Suzuki and the Yankee's Hideki Matsui.	2004-09-06

This book seems to take an intersting focus featuring stories with a heavy 1970's specific pop-culture bent that gives this book an almost time-capsule'ish feel capturing the trends/fashions/slang and even politics of this most colorful of contemporary decades.  For example, we get references to 'Star Wars,' in an amusing Halloween costume contest story, disco dancing (of course) and even a delightfully quaint story on the rising popularity of videogaming (Pong) and a bit of gender wars as the girls attempt to unseat the boys from the throne of videogame dominance.  While this book may seem different in that the general storylines seem to deviate from the standard Archie-esque plotlines (love triangles, archie-reggie rivalry, etc.) it's interesting to note a shift in tone as this comic series attempts to keep intact a teen audience shifting their attentions away from comics to more electronic forms of entertainment media.	2004-08-07

While the story is cleanly and briskly plotted, the middle act (the town of Barrow under siege) should have been further fleshed out.  Due to its relatively short length, it seems as if the book comes to a somewhat abrupt halt at the end but even with this put aside, the book is still very much worth your reading time with a great storyline and equally remarkable artwork by Ben Templesmith.	2004-08-07

An interesting transition takes place during the 1960's run of the 'Archie' comics series, namely a shift in its visual style.  In the early 60's the artwork is still very much in the same vein as it was in the 1950's - each frame packed with detail and a overall high-quality, stylized look.  From the midpoint of the 1960's and on the artwork seems to take a more economical approach with less detail, etc. that will come to define the look of 'Archie' comics in the 70's, 80's and on.  With this point in mind this 1960's volume of the 'Archie Americana' series serves as an intersting example of the gradual loss of detail that the artwork took throughout the decade and on.  The stories collected in this volume are also interesting in that for the first time 'Archie' comics refers back to real-life pop culture on a regualr basis.  For example, the stories collected in this volume feature such cultural icons as, 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' Beatles wigs, Nehru jackets, the hippie movement, etc.	2004-08-04

Smith's writing and story construction is as solid as ever - the only thing noticeably missing is the infusion of frequent humor.  The artistic collaboration with Charles Vess pays off magnificently as readers are treated to a lush, vibrant artscape that Vess is well know for.

Readers are also treated to a rich backstory on the origins of Rose and Thorn that does much to flesh out the epic storyline even further. Even with this darker mood settling in, Smith still manages to balance things off nicely with sprinklings of humour that in the end balances the dark/light atmosphere remarkably well.<br /><br /> FYI - an excerpt from Jeff Smith's biography in this book, explains the story/character genesis of the series:<br /><br /> &quot;Jeff created the Bone characters in kindergarten while growing up in Columbus, Ohio.

Fans of Gaiman's work in the medium of comic books will also appreciate the remarkable black & white illustrations provided by Dave McKean in each chapter.  My only nit-pick is that while I was appreciating McKean's artwork along with Gaiman's excellent storyline and characters one can't help but think that perhaps this story would've been better suited as a one-shot graphic novel.	2004-07-06

Personally, I feel that the artwork of 'Archie' comics was at it's apex in the 1950's thanks to its great attention to detail and for the fact that character design seemed to have been etched in stone from this point on.  While this book will entertain, its true value is in providing historical reference to the serious reader of this series.	2004-06-30

With that being said, if you were a fan of the, 'Sandman,' series then you certainly dug the character of Death, and with that of course you have to read this volume as well.  While the artwork is brilliant throughout (almost taking on a japanese manga look at times) the writing, sadly, just isn't quite up to snuff.  Still, it's a slim enough book to make breezing through quite an effortless and pleasing experience.	2004-06-29

While Book 1 was lovingly crafted to showcase material with historic value (e.g. - the first appearance of key characters, locations, etc.), Book 2 comes across a bit more lightweight in comparison as the stories seem selected more for the zaniness of its humor and the timeframe that the stories were selected from (1946-1949) seems somewhat narrower.  Still, this being Archie comics and all, it still manages to be an enjoyable read all the way through, but do make sure that you read/purchase Book 1 first.	2004-06-29

Within this framework, Tezuka will spin a deep and moving story set against the backdrop of Japan and Germany during WWII providing both entertainment and fresh historical perspective of events during this timeframe.<br />Spanning 5 volumes and over 1300 pages readers will easily glide through each book thanks to Tezuka's sharp and easy-to-digest narrative along with his crisp black & white artwork.  This series is highly recommended to anyone interested in graphic novels, excellent storytelling and WWII.  Definitely start with this first volume and enjoy the rest of the tale over the next 4 books.	2004-06-19

While the quality of the series has been excellent throughout, Vol. 5 is truly the hallmark of the series with excellent writing, artwork and the satisfying closure to every single one of the myraid subplots weaved throughout the series.<br />If you haven't read this series yet do yourself a favor by starting from the beginning and working your way through each of the 4 volumes till you reach this book.

Casual fans or those without much knowledge of Gaiman's epic mythology would probablly be best advised not to read this until they've digested the series in it's entirety.  Or maybe not.  This book is slim and as far as text goes, quite sparse.  Most readers will coast through this book in 15 minutes or so while still being able to appreciate the breadth of quality~~ artwork lining the pages.  But to truly appreciate it do yourself a favor and make sure you read the entire series first.~	2004-06-17

The stories chosen in this first volume are included primarily for their historical significance.  Kudos to the editorial staff for selecting such highlights like his first ever appearance in, 'Pep Comics' #22 along with other tales that introduce for the first time ever:<br />Betty Cooper<br />Jughead<br />Archie's Jalopy<br />Veronica Lodge<br />Mr. Weatherbee<br />Reggie Mantle<br />Mr. Lodge<br />Moose<br />While these early origin tales are not necessarily standouts storywise they do provide crucial insight into the genesis of this classic American comic series that fans will find much value in.	2004-06-14

For starters the hardback is slightly oversized and the thick, glossy paperstock wonderfully frames every panel of this diverse and beautifully illutrated book.<br />Fans of Neil Gaiman will find much to be delighted about in this return to his beloved, 'Sandman,' series.  Made up of 7 chapters, each chronicles one of the Endless (Death, Desire, Dream, Despair, Delirium, Destruction and Destiny) in a self-contained story superbly illustrated by a different artist.  Particular standouts are Milo Manara's contributions in 'Desire,' the subdued tones of Miguelanxo Prado in 'Dream,' and Barron Storey and Dave McKean's gritty work in 'Despair.'  As a volume of bonus material post-Sandman, this book is a wonderful treat for fans and certainly lives up to the quality we've come to expect from Gaiman and company.	2004-06-12

In Neil Gaiman's, 'Midnight Days,' fans are given a chance to take a look at some of Gaiman's somewhat esoteric and forgotten material.  Half of the volume is dedicated to short bits that he did for the 'Swamp Thing,' series and for those who are not familiar with Alan Moore's 1980's brilliant steerage of the series these stories will be somewhat difficult to follow and of not much interest.  Things do pickup midway through with the reprint of, 'Hold Me,' a one-shot story about John-Constantine, brilliantly illustrated by the always artful Dave McKean.  The volume comes to a close with an issue of, 'Sandman Midnight Theater,' with standout paintwork by Teddy Kristiansen that makes up for the weak plotting of the tale.<br />Ultimately, this book can only be recommended to fans of Gaiman who are interested in seeing some of his earlier and more experimental work.  Newcomers would be better off starting off with the 'Sandman' series and branching off thereafter.	2004-06-09

Fans of the series will not be disappointed with the intricate, but beautifully executed, plotting and characerizations that have certainly lived up to its billing as hallmarks of this series.	2004-06-08

This volume is notable for the character development of Adolf Kaufmann as he is torn between embracing the doctrine of Nazi cruelty versus his sympathy for the Jewish plight.  While the artwork may seem somewhat 'old-school,' for those accustomed to more contemporary manga, the art still manages to be fluid while conveying a range of emotion even beneath its surface simplicity.  The strength of this series though is in its top-shelf writing.  Excellent plotting, characterization along with interesting historical anecdote.	2004-06-06

This little book (140 pages or so, large print, small page size) reads so fluidly from start to finish, weaving in and out of past and present so effortlessly that when you're finally finished with it you're amazed at how deep the story actually is in conveying a complex tale of tragedy and loss.<br />I've recommended this book several times over to friends who consider themselves 'book afficionados,' but who actually never get around to reading a book for a plethora of reasons.  In most cases the slim size of the book along with its literary acclaim makes the book somewhat approachable and worthy of their time - and without fail my 'literary' friends are able to gobble this book up in a day or two and then spends the next month discussing the 'hot/new/brilliant' book they've just read to all watercooler aquaintances.	2004-06-05

This first volume clocks in at 260+ pages, and although the story and visuals flow at a rapid pace readers will find great delight in the superb artwork and stunning attention to detail that is packed into every panel.<br />While vol. 1 is basically the tale of ex-ninjas on the run (as they are being hunted down by their former clans), Sanpei Shirato finds time to inject occassional bits of humor and melodrama which ultimately gives this action packed series warmth and emotion.  Also of interest are footnotes explaining the Japanese names of various ninjitsu fighting techniques being used in the battle scenes.	2004-06-04

Those that actually make the commitment to read through this 6 volume, 2000+ page magnum opus of graphic storytelling are in for one heck of a ride.  Don't let this 360 page bad-boy's size scare you off - Katsuhiro Otomo's crisp storytelling and fantastic artwork literally flows at 100 m.p.h. giving you a smooth and intense reading experience.  Before you know it you'll be finished with this first volume and scrounging up the scratch to buy the rest of the books in this series.<br />Vol. 1 of, 'Akira,' sets the tone for the rest of the series at breakneck speed.  For those of you enamored with the film you'll truly enjoy and appreciate the heaping portions of additional backstory and characterization that the original 'book' series provides.  But perhaps most important of all is the stunning visuals of Otomo's fluid and highly detailed black &amp; white drawings.  The sheer amount of detail is breathtaking and will have you coming back for repeated reads just to appreciate the visuals.  A must read for fans of the movie or of sci-fi in general.	2004-06-03

Fans of the animated series will love the additional detail offered within these manga pages and those who haven't yet seen the televised versions will find this first volume a terrific way to get aquainted with the series.<br />Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's artwork is first rate stuff with every panel packed with oodels of graphic detail.

This first volume opens up in typical anti-hero fashion with a mortal character reluctantly thrust into the role of superhero and his subsequent struggle to assume such a larger then life identity.  While the story and plotting in vol. 1 is decent and perfectly serviceable, the strength of this series is ultimately found in the wonderful character development that takes shape through dozens of chapters.  Jack Knight, the hero of this tale, comes across as an everyman with a fascination for kitsch collectibles and pop culture while constantly struggling to find comfort from his transformation to super-being.  Good heady stuff without taking itself too seriously.	2004-05-26

Who amongst us isn't curious to see how alternative scenarios would've played out in the Star Wars universe should certain key events not have taken place.  In this volume readers are presented with the intriguing scenario on what happens when Luke Skywalker fails to blow up the Death Star as we've come to know based on events in Episode IV.  Readers are taken through an epic arc that would've encompassed 3 full movies but somehow seem boiled down to general thumbnail sketches thanks to the cramming of this storyline into four issues of 22 page comics.  Surely this series should've been stretched out a bit more to fill in the blanks and to embellish the drama a bit more.<br />With that being said, it's still worth your while to read through this series if you find the idea of such alternate-scenarios in the Star Wars universe to be of interest.	2004-05-03

Most people will have heard of this book for its unique attempt (at the time) to address serious social issue (sexual abuse) which it does a fantastic job of in terms of taste and message.  But while the abuse theme hovers constantly throughout the book, Talbot opens the world of his characters up and vividly recreates the mean streets of London and the scenic splendour of the English countryside that gives this book a grand feel to it without being bogged down by the heavier theme at hand.  Also of interest is the way the books of Beatrix Potter is weaved into the storyline not to mention some intriguing bits involving rats.	2004-05-03

Make no mistake about it, this book is brilliant and should be rated 5 stars if it weren't for the last 1/5 of it where we're offered 2 stories that suffer from a lack of narrative cohesion.  The first 4/5's though, demonstrate Clowes at his finest by way of his beautiful artwork and razor-sharp writing filled with pathos, humour and cutting observation.<br />Not to be missed by fans of Clowes not to mention newcomers interested in getting a taste of his work.	2004-04-30

Comics, 'The Swamp Thing.'  But before this battle occurs some interesting things take place.  For starters we get an imaginative hallucinatory ride as two people under different circumstances eat servings of the Swamp Thing's 'yam fruit,' and experience vibrant psychedelic journeys that change their lives in one way or another.  The Swamp Thing also does battle with a serial killer, faces a legion of ghosts in a Winchester Mystery House-esque haunted mansion, stumbles into violent chaos when parallel worlds collide, learns some new Elemental tricks while meeting his ancestors, and finally faces off with the ancient tribe of Warlocks - the Brujeria - who are bent on unleashing an ancient evil that will destroy Heaven itself.  From this point, the last few chapters build up too a whopper of a climax in the ultimate battle between dark and light that the universe has ever seen.<br />Definitely a great volume in this series as it offers fans everything that they've come to expect while taking it to new metaphysical heights and thus gearing readers for some intersting twists to come.	2004-04-28

Although this middle arc is seemingly lacking in a grand storyline of sorts - important ground is covered with the Swamp Thing discovering new abilities (mainly his ability to abandon his physical body and re-generate a new one), introducing some new characters, espousing on social issues and oodles of horror mainstays (vampires, werewolves, zombies) doing battle with ol' Swampy himself.  As far as contributing to the overall story arc this volume is somewhat lacking, but nonetheless makes for a very entertaining read all the way through.	2004-04-26

Clowes' brilliance is demonstrated with his remarkable ability in capturing dialogue and the psyches of his late-teenage female characters - Enid and Becky.  In fact, their characterizations and conversations seems so authentic and natural that it's almost as if Clowes videotaped real-life snippets of actual teenagers lives and then fashioned comic strips out of them.<br />Unlike the movie adaptation, which had a sustained narrative, the graphic novel is comprised of episodic vignettes that seem more like a collection of short stories.  These little tales are packed with so much melodrama, sharp-humour, keen observation and emotion that by the time you're finished with this 80 or so page book you'll feel like you've already digested volumes.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough and whether or not you've seen the movie you definitely need to read the original source.  Top quality stuff all the way through.	2004-04-25

In some regards this may be the case - especially with the brilliant first short story in this tiny tome, 'The Santa Land Diaries,' a hilarious memoir of Sedaris' experience working as a seasonal elf at Macy's.  Unfortunately the remaining five stories fail to sustain the high level of excellence delivered early on making the remaining 2/3's of the book somewhat of a disappointment.<br />If you are a fan of Sedaris or curious about all the hoopla surrounding his style of humor then this book is certainly worth your while, especially with its brilliant opening and the fact that it shouldn't take you more then an hour to read from cover to cover.	2004-04-25

The most interesting part of this book is the first 1/3 which basically serves as Cowell's biography as he recounts his privilleged upbringing as a British youth growing up on a 5 acre country estate and his eventual rise to the top of the music industry starting off as a mailroom lackey.  The rest of this book is filled with musings on the 'American Idol' phenomenon and bits on what comprises a, 'Star,' that offeres interesting insight.  Also of value to readers is the behind the scenes glimpses Cowell shares on how the music industry is run and how pop/rock stars are developed and herded along in their careers.<br />While not exactly the deepest book on the music industry around Cowell's breezy writing style makes for a nice, effortless read and is certainly worth a few hours of your time if you're a fan of the show.	2004-04-15

Otherwise, I think for most readers you could easily do without this book.  Yes, the artwork is slightly above average and certainly easy on the eyes but aside from introducing the Jedi - Quinlan Vos to the series, the story is average at best and offers little in terms of further fleshing out the Star Wars universe.	2004-04-14

Where the book stands out, and of great aesthetic value to adults, is in Dave McKean's stellar artwork.  Once again readers are treated to moody, surreal images that at times seem almost, 'too good,' for its own good.  Overall this book is not quite up to par with the highest of quality we've come to expect from Gaiman & McKean but still very worthy of your time.	2004-04-14

A few pages into this book and you'll immediately be hooked.  Your fingers will flip through page after page and before you know it you'll already have consumed several hundred pages of what will surely go down as a monument to the medium of the graphic novel the way Art Spiegelman's, 'Maus,' did in the 80's and Neil Gaiman's, 'Sandman' series offered throughout the 90's.<br />'Blankets,' at its core is a simple, timeless story (coming of age, first-love, alienation, anxiety, pursuit of spiritual identity, teen-angst) told thousands of times over the millenia (books, poems, songs, movies, television) but perfectly captured, perhaps for the first time, in comic-strip form.  This book is exquisitely plotted, paced, written and drawn and by the end of it all one can't help but be left dazed at the sheer artistic excellence demonstrated by Thompson, from start to finish, through thousands of panels.  Visually, the black and white artwork is a stunner but perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of all is Thompson's gift for prose with not a wasted word to be found in his minimalistic narrative that still manages to be filled with layer after layer of subtext.<br />This truly is a title not to be missed by anyone with an appreciation for the written word, not to mention the graphical novel format.  The stylish cover design and paper quality also lends itself very well as a gift-giving item.	2004-04-14

Readers are treated with colorfully fleshed out character portrayal, smidges of interesting backstory and a skeleton of a story that manages to keep things just interesting enough without bogging down the light, effervescent flow of Martin's prose.  Martin also proves that he's quite adept at culling the inner-voice of his characters as he meticulously brings to life everey bit of minutiae involved in the thought process of an OCD riddled character attempting to overcome obstacle after obstacle (in this case figuring out how to cross the street, the right amount of light bulb wattage to keep lit, etc.).  The end of the tale might come across as a bit too Hollywood in its payoff but nonetheless it satisfied and made for a great read on a 2 1/2 hour flight across 4 states.	2004-04-14

Readers are treated to 200+ pages of horrific goodness encompassing everything from the Swamp Thing's backstory, to his descent into a highly imaginative realization of Hell to a whimsical homage of Walt Kelly's, 'Pogo,' comic strips.  As good as these bits are the absolute strength in Vol. 2 is found in its final chapter - \\"The Rite of Spring.'  Published originally in 1985 as issue #34 of, 'The Swamp Thing,' this episode from start to finish deals with the physical/metaphysical consummation of love between the Swamp Thing and Abigail that will blow your mind.  Forget all that you've heard that this episode is nothing but 'sex with a vegetable.'  At its base, 'The Rite of Spring,' recreates the swooning emotions of love and passion in comic book form more effectively then 99.99% of every page of published prose out there on that matter.  At its original time of publishing it was a watershed moment in comics history and reading that chapter some 20 years later it still retains every bit of its artistic strength.	2004-04-08

A tale of dark and gloomy childhood flashbacks, 'Mr. Punch,' is a great read for those looking for something oozing with chilly atmosphere.  The mixed-media (enhanced photos and pencils) artwork by Dave McKean is astounding as well and visually evokes a feeling of helplessness confronting a child when stuck in a grim and depressing environment that amplifies all of his little fears.  While this book is nowhere near the epic grandeur of Gaiman's, 'Sandman,' series - as a standalone, 'Mr. Punch,' is a visual and narrative treat not to be missed.	2004-04-07

You'd be hard pressed to find a better illustrated graphic novel out there and the visual impact alone is sure to satisfy long-time fans of the GL as well as draw in new readers.  The writing does not quite live up to the high standard of the artwork but is still perfectly serviceable and offers a very cohesive, easy-to-digest storyline spanning 3 generations of the GL.

To start off, readers are given a somewhat generic story of Oz wandering through Hong Kong and Tibet in search of answers on how to control his werewolving ways.  The story is predictable and a yawner, offering little in the way of furthering character development in an ancillary Buffy character - Oz.  Equally dull is the artwork with little in the way of flair or panache to further stimulate visual interest.  I'd recommend reading this only if you can come across a copy on the cheap or for the most hardcore Buffy/Oz fans.  Otherwise they are plenty more worthwhile volumes in this series worth your coin and reading time.	2004-04-04

This volume presents 8, easily digestible, tales encompassing time periods from the 'Original' Slayer, Medeival Europe, The Wild West, Nazi Germany, NYC in the 70's and even a futuristic tomorrow.  The quality of each tale shines through as most are written by writers from the actual TV show - Whedon, Jane Espenson, Doug Petrie, etc.  Of equal quality is the artwork - different artists were used for each story giving each tale a unique sense of visual style.  Particularly interesting is Mira Friedman's almost woodblock approach on the Nazi-era, 'Sonnenblume,' and Gene Colan's 1970's flair on 'Nikki Goes Down!'	2004-04-03

This book is a complete standout both in writing and artwork.  Comprised of 4 chapters spanning 200 pages or so, each chapter is masterfully illustrated by AAA artists like John Bolton, Charles Vess, etc.  And we're not talking quickie pencil jobs either.  Each and every panel in this book is absolutely gorgeous - utilizing lush paint-work, fantastic coloring and razor sharp lettering.<br />Fans of the Sandman series will particularly appreciate the storyline for its meta views of the Sandman universe.  What readers are treated to is essentially a guided tour of the worlds (both in physical reality and nether regions) and timelines (the past, present and the absolute end of infinite time) occupied by the characters in the numerous volumes of the Sandman series.  In a nutshell this series is grand and sweeping in every sense of the word(s) and it's absolutely beautiful to look at.  Don't miss this one!	2004-04-02

Functioning as a prequel of sorts, this book chronicles Jennie 2.5's earlier days in NYC on the eve of the passage of the Clean Act Bill and how she becomes ensconed in the new American rebellion.  This book is also noteworthy in that Brian Wood turns over penciling duties to Becky Cloonan who manages to preserve the grim film noir tone of the original while brining a fresh visual approach of her own.	2004-04-01

The writing is quite exceptional in presenting a mostly believeable scenario (but still somewhat hard to believe that media/info outlets are so completely shut-down and filtered that everyday Americans no longer know what's happening in the rest of the world) on how citizens both cope with the new constraints and eventually rise up to fight back.  From start to finish the grim paranoia is effectively conveyed by Wood's masterful black and white illustration interspersed with faux propaganda artwork.<br />At this price, this book is of great value and not to be missed at all.	2004-04-01

Each panel conveys grand drama and sweeping motion to give the overall story a jittery, fast-forward motion feel to it.  Also of note is the remarkable emphasis placed on lettering, which certainly adds to the overall high quality graphic feel to the book.<br />On the downside, this slim book is somewhat skimpy in content.  Most readers will probablly finish this book within 20-30 minutes and that's factoring in the extra time used when savouring the artwork and reading through the somewhat grandstanding author profile at the beginning of the book.  All in all though, it is certainly worth your reading time or as an 'add' to your collection if you come across it at a decent price.	2004-04-01

Gilbert Hernandez's &quot;Fear of Comics&quot; is a wonderful anthology of comic shorts that serves as an excellent showcase of his first-rate writing and dramatic sensibilities.  Ranging in tone from zany to macabre to absurdist each of the dozen or so stories (along with another dozen or so comic-strips) are narrative treats unto themselves.  From the paranoia of the sci-fi tale, &quot;Return of the Tzik,&quot; to the surreal horrorscapes of &quot;The Legend of the Crying Woman: La Llorona,&quot; this book will surely have a story or two of interest to anyone - fans of Hernandez or not.<br />And, it certainly goes without saying that the stark black and white visuals in every panel actually lives up to the quality of writing working hand in hand to enhance the overall quality of the book every step of the way.  A quality book not to be missed by any fans of the graphic novel medium.	2004-03-30

Bolton's paint-work along with oil enhanced photographs give the graphics incredible depth and quite literally makes the visuals drip right off the pages.<br />That being said, the superb artwork is dragged down by a weakly plotted storyline of vengeance (ancient Greek style) that meanders from confusing and sophmoric throughout.  This purchase can only be recommended for those serious Sandman junkies who need to own every title in the series or for those who wish to savor Bolton's amazing artwork.	2004-03-28

This first volume collects the first seven chapters of Alan Moore's highly acclaimed helming of the 'Swamp Thing,' series.  Groundbreaking for its evocative bending of the horror genre in a major-label comic series, this collection of 'Swamp Thing,' chapters is not to be missed by anyone interested in comics as a legit form of narrative storytelling.<br />While Vol. 1 isn't the strongest in terms of story-punch and raw emotion, it certainly is required reading, in order to appreciate the full arc of this 30+ chapter series.  While the strongest chapters do take place in later volumes this initial volume does offer oodles of horrific goodness not to mention some intriguing layout design in its panels.

Believe me when I say that I was looking forward to reading this series the way a kid growing up in the early 80's would be on Christmas morning knowing that an Atari 2600 was waiting under the tree.  I mean, talk about your tasty yin-yang combo with hardcore fanboy Kevin Smith resurrecting the cult favorite Green Arrow.  But alas, was I ever left winded after slogging through this 10 issue mess of a series.  How did this Model T break down?  Couple of key stumbles in my opinion:<br />1) Poor plotting and pacing - This is a comic book for pete's sake!  Don't wait till issue 8 before we cut to the crux of the action and are formally introduced to the arch villain of the series.<br />2) Painful dialogue - While I love Kevin Smith's penchant for dialogue in the movies for some reason the dialogue sounds completely awkward.  Especially bad are the lines given to teenage characters.  At best they sound like shoddy attempts to mimic Joss Whedon-speak, ala 'Buffy.'<br />Then again, for those of you completely enamored with the D.C. Universe this series is definitely a 'not-to-be-missed,' but for those of you unfamiliar with G. Arrow this is not exactly the best introduction to the character and his storyline.	2004-03-15

In this 3-chapter collection, Gaiman expands on his epochal Sandman universe by focusing on the Dreamlord's fetching younger sister - Death.  Those who already follow the Sandman series are already familiar with this sassed-up, Goth personification of Death and will surely be remiss not to indulge in this graphic treat.  Those completely new to the Sandman saga will still be able to dive straight into the story without missing a beat, enjoying the full brunt of Gaiman's genius.<br />The strangest thing about this volume is a 6 page, Public Service Announcement of sorts found at the very end.  In this PSA, Death gives a full blown lecture on safe-sex, AIDS, and even gives a demonstration of proper condom insertion utilizing a banana!  A bit weird, no doubt and in the end very much dates this book as somewhat of a relic from the mid-90's.	2004-03-11

With that being said, Tezuka's storytelling and plot pacing is compelling enough that I did not feel 'lost,' in this complex tale of WWII with it's assortment of characters and subplot.  Within the first several pages I was more or less hooked into this epic tale on the racial origins of Adolf Hitler and the globe trotting antics of several parties to reveal and conceal the truth.<br />If you do decide to read this series, do it right the first time around and start with the first volume in the series:  \\"Adolf: A Tale of the Twentieth Century.\\"	2004-03-10

Lederer's memoirs show glimpses into a rich, quirky upbringing surrounded by a family of colorfully framed characters yet somehow stops short of fully fleshing out this tale and the folk involved.

The book spends the bulk of its pages locked up in the mind of the protagonist as she internally tussles back and forth on the merits and negatives of ethics, morals, familial strife and approaching mid-life crisis.  Some readers may find such internal dialogue to be somewhat captivating, however, less then 50 pages into the book I found myself highly annoyed by the whininess and lack of pro-active action of our protagonist and practically forced myself to read through the remainder of this novel.<br />With that being said, the book does improve the further you go with the occassional vintage Hornby moments of subtle humour and crafty dialogue but even these few redeeming moments surely do not justify the time required to slog through this book.  While Hornby's prowess as a writer is certainly not in question, his experiment in capturing middle-aged fem angst certainly is.  Nice, bold experiment on his part though.	2003-11-29

Anthony Bourdain switches to his fiction hat in his latest outing - a brisk paced read written in minimalist brushstrokes chronicling the adventures of Bobby Gold a tough-as-nails, recently released ex-con who is smitten w/the fetching saute cook at a niteclub/restaurant that he works the security detail on.  For fans of hard-boiled crime fiction, this book may leave you feeling a bit unsatisified as the narrative is somewhat lacking in painting pictures of grimy crime worlds, and ingenious criminial schemes, et al.  But what Bourdain clearly excels at and ultimately makes this slim-read somewhat worth your while are the moments detailing the inner workings of restaurants and the capturing of colorful banter between chefs, cooks, doing their jobs and talking smack amongst each other.	2003-10-17

Rather, it delves into other topics such as the history of the game, the colorful personalities, game lore and historical/memorable bad beats and monster calls.

On the downside, the information and strategy presented in this book are simplistic and somewhat out of date when the original 1987 publication date is taken into consideration.

With those factors in mind, I figured I couldn't go wrong with this one but sadly, for the first time, I was a bit let down by one of Hornby's books.<br />My main problem with this book stems from the fact that I missed out on approx. 30% of the context because I didn't know the people (players and coaches), places and teams that he spends a great deal of time espousing on.  This book is written with the assumption that the reader is steeped in all the lore, historical trivia and nuance of British football and for those with limited knowledge, well I suppose they'll find themselves grasping at times trying to catch up with Hornby's detailed play-by-play enactments of memorable goals and on field blunders.  Another thing - this is Hornby's first book and it shows.  For those readers accustomed to his flowing, easy to digest prose in future works ('High Fidelity,' 'About a Boy,' 'How to be Good') you might be a bit surprised at how clunky his words form here.  Yes, there are some very Hornbyesque passages and moments but for the most part it can be choppy reading at times but is interesting in the framework of mind knowing how his future works will evolve into crystalline works of literary brilliance.<br />On the positive note, this book will certainly strike a chord for every hardcore sports fanatic out there.  Hornby lovingly touches on the idiosyncracies that every true 'fan' experiences from: Superstitious ritual, disdain for the casual and/or bandwagon fan, the psyche of those who faithfully follow bad teams, etc.  Also, you'll find the occassional gem on the beauty of Football/Soccer as a pure sport that makes reading through this 247 page book ultimately worthwhile.	2002-06-27

A very difficult book to rate properly.  In a perfect world this book would've been more deserving of a 2 star review, yet based on Kerr's impassioned argument and perspective and for those with an interest and background in contemporary Japan, 'Dogs and Demons' is a fascinating read that presents one man's (sometimes flawed) portrayal of all that is rotten in the state of Nippon.<br />In scope, 'D&amp;D' is a highly ambitious work akin to a socially conscious author tackling a tome titled something like 'Contemporary United States: The Top 15 Things Wrong With It.'  Typically, with any subject matter as expansive as this you are bound to have some strong arguments and equally strong misses.  Based on Kerr's earlier work such as, 'Lost Japan (a much stronger portrayal of cultural identity),' I was hoping and expecting him to pull off what only a select few are capable of doing in sustaining a rationale argument throughout the length of a book.  Disappointingly, Kerr fails where most usually do when covering such an expansive subect and gives us your typical rant-n-rave slew of some great case points (namely politics, economic malaise, and the environment) and some weak, messy arguments (most of the pop-culture related chapters).<br />Perhaps the chief flaw of, 'D&amp;D' is the scale of judgement that Kerr chooses to weigh Japan upon, basically making it live up to the standards of a 'utopian' nation that not even the United States has come close to achieving.  While it is very true that Japan has committed many a policy blunder since it's post WWII recovery the bottom line is what nation hasn't(?) and all things considered can one argue that Japan's progress thus far has been a lesson in abject failure?<br />Some of Kerr's arguments are so bad that they're almost funny.  Examples (in no particular order):<br />1) Japan's high rate of literacy is superficial because most adults chiefly read comic books (well, at least they're reading something).<br />2) Japan is no longer a vibrant place to be as reflected in the number of ex-pats leaving the country (instead of providing us with any raw, statistical data on this point, Kerr makes reference to a couple of his friends that have decided to move elsewhere and takes the quote or two from others who we assume to be friends of friends or some varation thereof).<br />3) Japan is a nation obsessed with cuteness as seen in the popularity of Hello Kitty and other examples including ATM cards with 'cute' charicatures and as a result is becoming a 'childish' nation (not sure how this is necessarily a bad thing?  how about pointing out the fact that with examples like Sanrio characters, Pokemon, etc. Japan is only one of three nations, including the US and Great Britain, that regularly creates and markets pop-culture on a world-wide scale?).<br />4) Japan's cultural malaise can be reflected in the fact that it's top baseball players are leaving to play in the U.S. major leagues (again, not necessarily a bad thing - the fact that top players want to leave their home nation to make more money and test their abilities against top talent in the world?  who could argue otherwise?).<br />5) Japan's film industry has gone to ruins (true) and today it's best creative work is demonstrated in shallow, superficial creations like 'Pokemon' (while it is true that the likes of 'Pokemon' and most manga creations are far from the aesthetic hurrah of a Kurosawa creation, there is a case to be made that it takes some creative ingenuity to create pop-culture franchises that rank right up there, dollarwise, with Walt Disney franchise characters.  Another point that Kerr neglects is that while the film industry isn't what it once was, Japan is leading the way in other creative industries, chiefly videogames/interactive entertainment an industry bigger and growing faster then the movies).<br />If you're able to look past some of these soft spots in the book, 'D&amp;D' will certainly open your eyes to why Japan has been mired in recession for nearly a decade and why it may be a long time coming before it's engines revv up once again.  At it's best, 'D&amp;D' may serve as a public wake up call to shake up Japan's stifling beauracracy and petty ways.mired in recession for nearly a decade and why it may be a long time coming before it's engines revv up once again.

Ambrose does not disappoint and the bulk of this book - dealing with the training processes, descriptions of personality, psyche along with numerous humourous anecdotes are as well written as anything that i've seen in any combat/military book around.  While the recounting of Easy Company's battles and detailed breakdown of squad/tactical manuevers are important and given equal attention they thankfully take a backseat to the more captivating storyline on how esprit de corp was developed over time and the value of the camarederie and brotherhood that the surviving members valued most of all.  If you were a fan of the HBO mini-series and had even the tiniest inkling in learning more about this 'Band of Brothers,' you can't go wrong with this very well-written, detailed account of their story.	2002-04-12

With stylistic black and white illustration scattered throughout along w/Courlander's simplistically elegant prose this book makes for a nice, light read.  Perfect for the discriminating reader of all ages.	2002-04-10

Book itself is nicely laid out, illustrated and printed on excellent stock.  A great start point for newcomers to the field in learning more about key designers and products launched and fielded by Alessi.  On the downside though, this book lacks depth and could've used better 'copy' to provide for a more interesting read.	2002-04-06
