He has a knack for finding interesting people and places, and he presents it all with wit and charm and a personal engagement that is beguiling. The books are beautiful with lots of great color pictures, most taken by photographer Basil Pao.    This book is based on the BBC TV program where Mr. Palin traveled to all of the places where Ernest Hemingway had lived and traveled. One can't really say the program \\"follows Hemingway's footsteps\\" because some sequences are presented out of order, but it's all there:    Chicago and northern Illinois (Hemingway's youth)  Italy (WW I and duck hunting)  Paris (Hemingway's start as an author)  Spain (running with the bulls, bullfighting)  Key West (fishing, boxing)  Africa (hunting, airplane crash injuries)  Cuba (fishing, Hemingway's home for 20 years)  Montana and Idaho (dude ranches, Hemingway's death)    Each chapter that describes a place almost invariably leaves the reader smiling and thinking that it would be interesting to visit that place oneself.    Incidentally, my high opinion of this book (and the associated TV program) has nothing to do with any interest in Hemingway's authorship. I read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" when I was in high school, and have not read anything by Hemingway since. Still, I find his life interesting, and I think that Michael Palin has made a great travelogue by visiting the various places and telling about Hemingway's life.    I can especially recommend the audio version of this book, which is read by Michael Palin himself. He does a great job of delivering the dialog of the various people, all with their different accents.     Of course, the audio version of the book does not include the beautiful photographs, so the very best strategy might be to get both, and listen to the audio version while commuting and then look at the pictures when you get home.

Partly because the story is very timely, couched in the post Sept. 11, 2001 world of Moslem terrorists vs. the West, and eerily predicting with great accuracy a terrorist attack in London. But I also liked the book because I liked the writing, I liked the characters, and I found the story very exciting, although a bit unrealistic.<br /><br />The main protagonist is Tara Chace, a young woman who works for the British government in some kind of secret service department. On the book cover she is labeled as a spy, and inside the book she is referred to as an agent, but what she really is is an assassin, and a very good one. She and her two male colleagues are given the job of killing someone when the British government decides, for example after a terrorist attack on the London underground system, that someone somewhere needs to be killed.<br /><br />Tara and the other characters in the book, including several of the bad guys, are portrayed in the story as very interesting people. They all have their character quirks and flaws, and thus come across as real people, not clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Part of the story takes place in London, where there are many inter-departmental squabbles and the problems of politics vs. morals. The rest of the story takes place in the Middle East, in Yemen, Cairo, Israel and Saudi Arabia. I found the descriptions of Arab culture and attitudes very interesting, and the way in which Moslem fundamentalists recruit terrorists and suicide bombers to be fascinating.<br /><br />At one point I was going to give \\"A Gentleman's Game\\" five stars, but the plot became a bit too unrealistic and the ending somewhat contrived. Still, I'm looking forward to reading more by Greg Rucka.<br /><br />Incidentally, Greg Rucka has also written some graphic novels (comic books) with the same main characters, his \\"Queen and Country\\" series.<br /><br />Rennie Petersending somewhat contrived.

America) is a quite different book from the Jake Grafton series that made Stephen Coonts famous. Personally, I don't like the change in style. <br /> <br />I'm a fan of thrillers, especially international thrillers and techno-thrillers. I like most of Stephen Coonts' books and consider them to be \\"the thinking man's thriller\\", a notch up on the intellectual scale from Tom Clancy, for example. <br /> <br />\\"Wages of Sin\\" is different from the Jake Grafton series in many ways. To start with, the main character is Tommy Carmellini, a CIA operative who plays a secondary role in the last four Jake Grafton books. <br /> <br />Tommy Carmellini reminds me of Mike Hammer, the fictional hero of Mickey Spillane's books. He's physically big, he's tough and doesn't shun violence, he's great with the fast-paced repartee and he doesn't claim to be all that smart. Women find him attractive (what's with these silly women anyway?) and he beds them without much emotional involvement. And he tells his story in the first person. <br /> <br />Fortunately, Stephen Coonts is not 100% loyal to the first-person style. As the book progresses there are more and more passages that tell parts of the story that Tommy Carmellini can't tell because he's not at that location. <br /> <br />There is a lot of violence in this book, something that doesn't particularly appeal to me. The body count rises slowly but surely through the story, with Tommy personally killing 13 of the \\"bad guys\\"! These shootouts and other fights are described in detail, and are exciting at first, but about half way through the book it gets tedious. <br /> <br />The romantic (to use the word very loosely) subplots are very minor. Tommy succeeds (without trying or particularly enjoying it) in bedding three of the female characters. But if Tommy doesn't really care much one way or the other, why should we? <br /> <br />The weirdest scene in the whole book is when Tommy makes love to one of the women in a bugged hotel room, knowing that his best friend is monitoring the bugs! The fact that he doesn't particularly like the lady in question just added to my incredulity! <br /> <br />A general problem with the whole book is that the characters are poorly presented and not very believable. Surprising, considering that Stephen Coonts is otherwise very good at writing books populated with real people.  <br /> <br />In particular, Tommy Carmellini doesn't come across as a believable person. To make it worse, he isn't a person that I find all that appealing. He's great at shooting holes in the bad guys and making clever remarks, but I'd prefer a leading \\"good guy\\" who is smarter and displays more real human characteristics. <br /> <br />On the plus side, the plot is pretty good. The story is partly based on the real-life defection of Vasili Mitrokhin, the KGB archivist who arrived in Great Britain in 1992 with six suitcases of notes from classified KGB files! Mix this with an American presidential nomination and people in high places with a past that is damaging to their political careers and you have an exciting cocktail. <br /> <br />Still, the good plot can't compensate for the disappointing characters and the repetitive violence, so I'm only giving three stars to \\"Wages of Sin\\". <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-09-22

But they ignore this information and continue to blunder onwards as if they don't care!  <br /> <br />Another example: By the time one gets to the end of the book it becomes obvious that the bad guys could not possibly have known that the 400-year-old journal told about an important religious relic. This makes the whole story crazy - why did the bad guys try to steal the journal and try to force Harry and Zola to give it up?  <br /> <br />A final problem is that the characters in this book (like in a Dan Brown book) are not at all believable. In particular, Harry and Zola come across as pretty silly, in an amusing way, but do not resemble real people.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you're willing to totally suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride then \\"Shattered Icon\\" is lots of fun.

US	52823951	R18KCH5KJA97YF	0140271775	674121099	The Marketmaker	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Exciting enough, but somewhat unrealistic and irritating	\\"The Marketmaker\\" is a thriller by British author Michael Ridpath and set in the financial world of investment bankers and bond traders. The basic idea appeals to me because I'm curious about the financal business world and the people who work in these high-paid jobs, while at the same time I like being excited by stories of murder and mayhem.    The story in \\"The Marketmaker\\" is about Nick Elliot who joins a London bond brokerage company that specializes in Latin American bonds. Soon after he starts Nick discovers that a former employee was killed in Caracas and that there are suspicions of the laundering of drug money via secret bank accounts controlled by the company. Then, during a visit to Rio de Janeiro, Nick is attacked and almost killed himself!    Nick falls in love with Isabel, a fellow employee. Together they try to determine what is going on. Is the boss aware of the money laundering? How about the boss's nasty brother, who works as the company's \\"enforcer\\"? Then, on another trip to Rio, Isabel is kidnapped!    There is no doubt that \\"The Marketmaker\\" is exciting, a good thing for a thriller. In addition, I liked the descriptions of how bond traders and investment bankers work and live. And I loved the descriptions of Brazil in general and Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in particular, especially the contrasts between the beautiful neighborhoods where the rich live and the terrible shantytowns where the poor live.    Unfortunately, there were quite a few aspects of the story that I found very unrealistic, and I dislike books where I can't believe in the story. I could go into detail but that might spoil the story for potential readers so I'll refrain.    Another problem for me was that I found the writing rather irritating at times. Nick Elliot tells the story in the first person, and I got very tired of his stream-of-thought recitals of how he could justify to himself some of the things he did. His hypocritical justification for getting revenge in a way that misused the trust of his two best friends and jeopardized their well-being was especially trying.    Still, \\"The Marketmaker\\" is a fairly good read, and I do like reading exciting thrillers set in the world of business and high finance. It's just too bad that it was so unrealistic and irritating.    Rennie Petersen	2005-09-16

The SBS (Special Boat Service) is Britain's Special Forces unit that corresponds to the U.S. Navy SEALs. It is not as well known as Britain's SAS (Special Air Service), and I must admit that I had never heard of it until I ran across one of Duncan Falconer's novels half a year ago.    Duncan Falconer was a member of the SBS for a dozen years from around 1975, getting in at age 19, the youngest ever for a new member. \\"First Into Action\\" is his personal account of his life in the SBS plus a bit about his childhood and his entering the British Royal Marines.    If you're really keen on books about Special Forces units and the men who serve in them then I can recommend \\"First Into Action\\". Duncan Falconer does tell it like it is, and the story is very interesting.    Readers who are not so fascinated with the reality of Special Forces will find this book less appealing.     The most powerful impression I got from reading this book is that the men of the SBS are a bunch of suicidal maniacs! (I exaggerate - please bear with me.)     Duncan Falconer spends most of this book describing three aspects of the SBS: how dangerous it is, how self-motivated and intrepid the members are, and how often things go totally wrong.    The selection procedure is described, and it becomes obvious that in order to become a member of the SBS you have to be willing to push yourself to the point of physical injury. And the instructors come across as sadists.    After you become a member of the SBS you spend a lot of time doing exercises (or \\"rehearsals\\", as they call them) to keep your skills up to snuff. High-altitude parachuting, submarine exits, climbing oil rigs during a violent storm, testing new weapons and explosives, diving in freezing water, descending from a helicopter onto a bucking ship, etc., etc. You name it, the SBS can do it, or die trying. And a lot of them do die trying.    In addition to the many deaths there are a large number of injuries, some that heal and some that result in being incapacitated, perhaps even ending up in a wheelchair for the rest of your life.    There are also an incredible number of screw-ups in the missions that the SBS is involved in that can be considered humorous. In fact, large portions of the book are written in a tongue-in-cheek tone that is intended to be a contrast to the serious and heroic books by former members of the SAS and other Special Forces units.    Speaking of the SAS, another theme of \\"First Into Action\\" is the rivalry between the SBS and the SAS. The title of the book refers to the claim that the SBS is always (or almost always) the first British military unit sent into any conflict, before the SAS or anyone else.     Duncan Falconer writes with scorn about several SAS missions that went awry, including the famous Bravo Two Zero during the first Iraq war, and the accidental killing of an SBS operative during the Falklands War.    On the back cover of the paperback edition I read it said that Mr. Falconer had a \\"leading role\\" in SBS operations in the Falklands. This isn't true. In the text of the book Duncan Falconer writes that he was not involved in the Falklands at all, although he recounts several stories about the SBS teams that were there.     Much of the book describes Mr. Falconer's personal experiences during his time in Northern Ireland combating the IRA. This is fairly interesting, but not the kind of work that most Special Forces fans prefer to read about.     A few final points: The book is too long in my opinion, and it suffers from there being no dates whatsoever for the various events that take place. It's nice that there is a glossary of the military terms and acronyms used - I referred to it fairly often.    In conclusion, this book will appeal to Special Forces fans because it's a very honest look at the SBS, one of the world's best Special Forces units. My three-star rating of \\"First Into Action\\" is largely due to it being outside my normal reading preferences. For me it was an OK read, but Mr. Falconer's novels (\\"The Hostage\\" and \\"The Hijack\\") are more to my taste - I give them both four stars.    Rennie Petersen	2005-09-11

At the end of the book Tom Sedley is 72. During these 55 years of Tom's life there is one overriding factor on his mind: an uncertainty as to who killed his younger sister back in 1948. <br /> <br />\\"Dark Angel\\" is basically a murder mystery or whodunnit. But it is a murder mystery that spans 55 years and is recounted in terms of the impact it has on Tom Sedley and a few other people that were close to the crime when it was committed. <br /> <br />Approximately half of the story takes place in 1950 while Tom and his (former) best friend Marcus are serving in the British Army in Korea during the start of the Korean War. In this section of the book we are told a lot about the Korean War (sometimes called \\"The Forgotten War\\") and the inhumanity of war in general. Tom and Marcus are no longer best friends, and Tom is troubled by doubts that Marcus may be the person who killed his sister. <br /> <br />The remaining half of the story takes place in 1982. Tom's mother has died and during his emptying of the childhood house Tom finds a secret diary that belonged to his sister. Once again there are indications that Marcus may have been the killer. At the same time another childhood friend gets involved, and a very unexpected person arrives in England and gets in touch with Marcus (and Tom). But once again there is no clear resolution, and we are still unsure of who killed Tom's sister so many years ago. <br /> <br />At the end of the book there is an epilogue that takes place in 2004. Tom Sedley is 72, and is still haunted by the events that took place 55 years ago. Will there finally be a resolution to this mystery that has traumatized him so much? <br /> <br />I liked \\"Dark Angel\\" a lot because of the interesting story and the interesting people who are involved. None of the main characters are average; they are all special in one way or another. Many of these people have secret motives and all of them are affected in various ways by the murder in 1948. This makes the story very gripping - we want to learn what will happen to Tom and the others, and, like Tom, we want to learn the truth about what happened to his sister.  <br /> <br />Incidentally, this book is quite unlike the other books that Geoffrey Archer has written. This is a murder mystery, not a military action thriller like Mr. Archer's previous books, despite part of the story taking place on the battlefield of the Korean War, and despite the 1982 events having some connections to the Falklands War. <br /> <br />Highly recommended if you like murder mysteries told in terms of the long-term effects the murder has on the people involved, and if you like being teased about who the murderer was until the very last page. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-09-07

Chris Cameron is 22 and serving in the British Navy as a Harrier pilot. He sees an important target and asks for permission to attack. Permission is denied. Cameron disobeys orders and attacks anyway. It turns out that that was the right thing to do so he's a hero, despite his insubordination.<br /><br />Twenty years later Chris Cameron is the captain of the British aircraft carrier HMS Indomitable. There's serious trouble brewing in Numala, a former British colony in Africa, now run by a vicious and brutal dictator. The British Foreign Secretary, hoping to score some points in his party's popularity contest, makes an idiotic decision. Against the advice of the top British military staff he sends HMS Indomitable, without her escort fleet, to patrol the \\"international waters\\" off the coast of Numala.<br /><br />This is the background for the very exciting story that develops in \\"Blind Eye\\". Captain Cameron and his men (and women) become more and more involved in what is happening in Numala, and more and more outraged by the atrocities that the dictator is preparing. Meanwhile, international opinion turns against the British for their attempt to influence an independent country with \\"gunboat tactics\\". The wishy-washy Foreign Secretary orders HMS Indomitable home again.<br /><br />Will Captain Cameron obey his new orders or follow his conscience?<br /><br />What should military personnel do when given orders that they know are wrong?<br /><br />Suffice it to say that \\"Blind Eye\\", after a rather slow start, becomes very exciting. A modern aircraft carrier (even a British one, with only one quarter the displacement of the huge American ones) and its complement of aircraft are a very potent fighting machine. The unexpected climax is especially satisfying, considering that at one point it looked like success was not possible for the British.<br /><br />As an added bonus there's a rather unlikely romance story woven into \\"Blind Eye\\". But then, the whole story is rather unrealistic, so why not have a bit of unrealistic romance too?<br /><br />In summary, an exciting military-style thriller with a thought-provoking story line and some interesting characters thrown in.<br /><br />Rennie Petersenather unrealistic, so why not have a bit of unrealistic romance too?

US	52823951	R2NE2NWQWI91ZR	0141013885	336389090	Cobraville	Books	2	3	11	N	N	Too much intolerance towards foreigners	I bought Cobraville based on the blurb on the back cover. It promised an action story involving a top-secret CIA team, and included this text: \\"... they will uncover a conspiracy that snakes all the way through the corridors of power, to the very highest level ...\\" <br /> <br />I'm disappointed, very disappointed. <br /> <br />To start with the positive aspects, Carsten Stroud definitely has a way with words. I found many of his descriptions very appealing, and he is good at writing action scenes. The irreverent smart-ass dialog between the CIA team members is very amusing. <br /> <br />The general story line, with two main characters and two inter-related stories, is quite satisfying. In Washington and New York we have Drew Langan, U.S. Senator and member of the Senate Intelligence Oversight Committee. In the Philippines we have Drew's son, Cole Langan, leader of a heavily armed CIA team sent to replace a secret communications relay device. <br /> <br />The story constantly switches back and forth between Drew and Cole, with both of them getting into deeper and deeper trouble. Very exciting. <br /> <br />But now come the negative aspects. <br /> <br />The story is indeed exciting, with obvious bad guys and shadowy bad guys and several characters who tantalize by acting as if they might (or might not) be bad guys. But way too many things are done that simply don't make any sense, except as artificial suspense-inducing elements. And artificial suspense-inducing elements fall flat as soon as you realize that they are artificial. <br /> <br />For example, why was Drew Langan given coordinates hidden in the paper ring on a cigar instead of just on a piece of paper? Why was a PC programmed to display a self-destruct countdown message, creating an artificial race-against-time situation? Etc, etc. <br /> <br />Then there are the characters themselves, and a surprising amount of intolerance towards foreigners that I found off-putting. <br /> <br />\\"Cole disliked the Canadian flag almost as much as he disliked Canadians.\\" pg 15. <br /> <br />Regarding a member of Cole's team: \\"you only asked him for his views on the French and the Germans if you wanted to see all the veins in his neck and forehead pop out.\\" pg 47 <br /> <br />\\"'F**k the Frogs and bugger the Krauts.'\\" pg 55 <br /> <br />Not surprisingly, Cole's team gets into a serious firefight with a UN / German peacekeeping force in the Philippines, with casualties on both sides. Not surprisingly, Cole's team is so good and the Germans so poor that there are almost 10 times as many German as American casualties. To top it off, the German and French UN peacekeeping forces are portrayed as barbaric and dumb. <br /> <br />The obvious bad guys are the Moslem terrorists, and they are portrayed as not just bad, but as disgusting monsters. One of them points his gun at a German co-conspirator and tells him to strangle his eight-year-old son - and the German complies! Another Moslem is a pedophile who, after the successful bombing of a caf with dozens of deaths, is described as being sexually aroused by the deed and sating himself with a child. <br /> <br />Personally, I have no sympathy for Moslem terrorists, but I don't see any purpose in portraying them as monsters. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, back in the USA Drew Langan is discovering that almost all of the bad guys at the top level are Germans (surprise, surprise). <br /> <br />As a final criticism I'll mention that I didn't particularly like either of the two main characters. Cole Langan comes across as intolerant and obsessed with doing what he sees as his duty. Drew Langan is more flexible, but he's having amorous ideas regarding a female Secret Service agent young enough to be his daughter. <br /> <br />First Drew makes an (unsuccessful) pass at her. Later, during a discussion of the disfiguring (both mental and physical) scars that she bears from having been burned, she blurts out, \\"Would you like to see it Drew? Is that what this isabout? Because I can show you it right now.\\" <br /> <br />\\"'No,' said Drew. 'Please don't.'\\" pg 415 <br /> <br />With friends like that, who needs enemies? <br /> <br />In summary, I liked the writing and I liked the excitement. What I didn't like was that much of the excitement was due to plot elements that made no sense, that parts of the story and many of the characters displayed an intolerance towards foreigners, and that the two main characters didn't appeal to me. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-09-01

US	52823951	RHA58N7UCPKBU	028563707X	300787963	I, Lucifer (Modesty Blaise series)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	"I wouldn't know, Johnnie. I don't know what it's like to be dead."	Modesty Blaise's good friend John Dall can't understand why Modesty insists on risking her life to try to save the life of a person with an incurable and debilitating mental problem. \\"You really think he's better off alive?\\" he asks Modesty.    \\"I wouldn't know, Johnnie. I don't know what it's like to be dead,\\" replies Modesty.    That's good enough for me. :-)    \\"I, Lucifer\\" (1967) is the third book in the Modesty Blaise series of action thrillers written by Peter O'Donnell back in the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's. This is a series of books that I really love, and you may wish to take a look at my \\"So You'd Like To\\" guide here at Amazon.com about reading books by Peter O'Donnell.     Although I love this series of books I've decided to only give four stars to \\"I, Lucifer\\". The reason is that the supernatural plays a very important role in the story, and I'm too much of a skeptic to believe in such things. In addition, a major coincidence occurs that also reduces the believability of the plot in my mind.    The bad guys are always a major element in a Modesty Blaise story. In \\"I, Lucifer\\" we meet Seff and his wife Regina, two elderly puppeteers who turned to crime when they could no longer find work due to the closure of the vaudeville theaters. Unlikely villains, but they are described as being so evil that one feels a chill running down one's back.     Seff and his wife have developed a diabolical way of threatening people and demanding protection money. But they happened to have René Vaubois (a friend of Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin) on their list of targets, and he refused to pay when threatened. And René happens to be together with Modesty and Willie when a gang tries to kill him, to set an example for the other targets.    This is the start of a long and complicated story. First Modesty and Willie have to find the bad guys, then they suffer a major setback, and then we are led to the exciting final confrontation.    The high point in this book, in my opinion, is when Modesty and Willie are forced to fight a duel to the death against each other. Of course, I can't reveal what happens, but as usual Peter O'Donnell has created a story with many twists and surprises. And, as usual, the very special relationship between Modesty and Willie is an important and appealing part of the book.    This book introduces Stephen Collier, a recurring figure in several of the later Modesty Blaise books. I have mixed feelings about Stephen Collier, and am never really sure about what it is that Modesty sees in him.    One final point I'll mention is that the paperback edition of this book contains a couple of typographical errors not present in the original hardcover edition. Amazing as it sounds in our post-PC era, the text of books must have been manually re-entered back then when a book was copied from hardcover to paperback.    In conclusion, a great Modesty Blaise adventure, but not one of my favorites because of the emphasis on a certain supernatural ability of one of the characters in the story.

US	52823951	RY9HRXTQQSTLL	0140295917	1342687	Fatal Error	Books	4	61	62	N	N	Fatal Error - a thriller in four parts	\\"Fatal Error\\" is a thriller built up in a rather special way.    Part 1 (chapters 1 and 2) takes place in London in Sept. 1999. An unknown assailant kills the chairman of the dot-com startup company featured in the story.    Part 2 (chapters 3 - 23) takes place in France (July 1987), Scotland (June 1992) and London (April - Aug. 1999). In other words, this part of the book consists of flashbacks that provide background information for what happened in Part 1. But the 1987 and 1992 flashbacks are interwoven with the 1999 flashbacks, so you are kept on your toes all the time. As expected (this is a thriller), a dead body turned up in both 1987 and 1992, and in neither case was the killer identified, let alone apprehended.    Part 3 and Part 4 (chapters 24 - 40) take up the story where Part 1 ended, i.e., London, Sept. 1999. Is the new killing related to the killings in 1987 and 1992? Who is sending the anonymous threatening e-mails? Will there be more killings?    The fact that almost half of the book consists of flashbacks and that the flashbacks are not presented chronologically actually heightens the excitement. However, I did find myself compelled to go back and reread Part 1 after finishing Part 2 in order to reestablish the flow of recent events in my mind.    The story is based in the heady dot-com entrepreneurial days in the late 1990's. New companies are going from zero to a stock market valuation of billions of pounds in the space of a year or so. The youthful employees are becoming millionaires and the bosses are willing to do whatever it takes to crush the competition and get a successful IPO (Initial Public Offering, i.e., getting on the stock market).    Note, however, that although \\"Fatal Error\\" is a story based on the building up of an Internet company, that the technology aspects are not the most important. Similarly, even though the financial implications of starting a company and getting venture capital financing and going to the stock market are important sides of the story, they are not the most important factors.     Instead, \\"Fatal Error\\" is basically a traditional thriller about a psychopath who has killed and is willing to kill again, and the danger this person represents to the people around him/her.     I found the book quite intriguing and enjoyable, especially due to my own background in the IT business. Surprisingly, I did not find any errors in the author's descriptions of how IT companies function and how web sites are built up. The discussions of the financial aspects also sounded correct to me, and they should be since the author has a background at an international bank in the City of London. This added to the overall credibility of the whole story.    In addition, the characters in the book seemed quite believable, with perhaps one exception. Incidentally, the story is told in the first person, but it is very well done so you hardly notice this normally problematic style.    My only major complaint is that the ending seemed too contrived. Were it not for that I'd be giving five stars to \\"Fatal Error\\".    A highly recommended thriller, especially if you're interested in the IT business and/or the financial markets.

The climax of \\"The Hijack\\" occurs when one of the good guys attacks a nuclear \\"suitcase bomb\\" with a brass crucifix and a stone, in an attempt to prevent it from exploding. (I am not making this up.) <br /> <br />In other words, \\"The Hijack\\" is not your typical action thriller. Yes, many of the usual ingredients are present, including an Arab terrorist attack, a nuclear device, the threat of WW III, the tough guys from the British and Russian Special Forces and the cynical manipulators in the intelligence agencies. <br /> <br />But the characters are not stereotyped, and come across as real people. The hero, John Stratton of the British SBS, is a complex person filled with conflicting desires and doubts. There's an Arab terrorist with a very unusual background with whom we find ourselves sympathizing. Even the \\"bad guy\\" who prepares for the detonation of the nuclear device in the hopes of starting WW III is presented as a very interesting and understandable person. <br /> <br />There are other unusual aspects to the story too, for example a clairvoyant who works for the CIA. And there are occasional bits of humor, like when one of Stratton's colleagues speculates about whether an especially long nose hair was actually an ingrown eyebrow hair. <br /> <br />Duncan Falconer, the author of \\"The Hijack\\", is a former member of the British SBS, the elite Special Boat Service, similar to the U.S. Navy SEALS. This gives his novels an extra air of authenticity, and many of the combat details are fascinating. <br /> <br />But Duncan Falconer doesn't follow the writing style of Andy McNab, former British SAS member, whose novels describe the nitty-gritty of Special Forces skills and procedures in excruciating detail. Instead, Mr. Falconer's writing style is closer to that of Frederick Forsyth, with a plot that works on several levels, from the fights between the individual good guys and bad guys to the high-level decision-making in the various intelligence agencies. <br /> <br/>There's also a touch of Matthew Reilly in Duncan Falconer's story telling, especially the description of how three SBS teams led by Stratton stage an assault on a hijacked supertanker. Here the action is definitely over the top, but quite entertaining. <br /> <br />My only real criticism is that the whole story is rather farfetched. But this is a standard problem with action thrillers - it's very difficult to write an exciting story that passes the test of being completely believable. <br /> <br />\\"The Hijack\\" is definitely a much better than average action thriller, and highly recommended if you're in the mood for a hard-hitting story in the style of Frederick Forsyth, with touches of Andy McNab and Matthew Reilly. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-08-07
US	52823951	R2L8U8CXGPUBJK	0312971397	896256339	Cuba: A Jake Grafton Novel (Jake Grafton Novels)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Stephen Coonts kills Fidel Castro a second time!	In \\"Under Siege\\" (1990) Stephen Coonts tells about a revolution in Cuba. The Cubans are fed up with Fidel Castro and rebel. \\"Viva Cuba! Cuba Libre!\\" they chant. \\"They shot Castro around ten o'clock the next morning\\", it says on page 210 of the paperback edition I read. <br /> <br />In \\"Cuba\\" (1999) it turns out that the revolution in 1990 was just a figment of Stephen Coonts' imagination! Fidel Castro is still alive, and still dictator of Cuba, but now he's dying of cancer! Fortunately, his mistress is at his bedside when he expires, and she manages to grab some videotapes that will later play an important role in the selection of Castro's successor. <br /> <br />One wonders what Fidel Castro thinks of all this. <br /> <br />I think it's unfortunate that Stephen Coonts bases a book to such a large extent on a real person. In \\"Under Siege\\" Castro wasn't really in the story, and his death was a minor event. But in \\"Cuba\\" the dying Castro is THE main character for the first 100 pages. And for the following 150 pages the main story is about how the various people in Castro's inner circle fight each other to become the new leader of Cuba. <br /> <br />It's all very exciting and interesting, but it's so hypothetical (the last I heard good ol' Fidel was still alive and kicking) that it makes it difficult to get seriously involved.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, in the last half of the book Rear Admiral Jake Grafton of the U.S. Navy becomes the central figure in the story, together with his loyal sidekick Toad Tarkington. Toad's wife Rita is also present, flying a V-22 Osprey, a hybrid helicopter / fixed-wing aircraft - more about this later. <br /> <br />The focal point of the overall story are some chemical/biological warheads belonging to the USA, and some ditto chemical/biological warheads being developed by the Cubans for use against the USA. The Americans are shipping their CBWs from Guantnamo Bay back to the USA for destruction, but the Cubans manage to hijack the transport ship, so now the Cubans have both their own CBWs and the American CBWs. It's a new Cuban missile crisis, for those who can remember the first Cuban missile crisis back in the 1960's. <br /> <br />Stephen Coonts' solution to this crisis is a bit too Tom Clancy'ish for my taste. Lots of high-tech weaponry (cruise missiles and stealth bombers, for example) being used to put a third-world country in its proper place. Still, it is rather exciting, and recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq indicate that it's not all that unlikely.  <br /> <br />This book marks the introduction of Tommy Carmellini, a CIA operative and former jewel thief. Tommy goes on to feature in the next three Jake Grafton books, and then finally graduates to star in his own book, \\"Liars & Thieves\\" (2004) (published as \\"Wages of Sin\\" in Europe). <br /> <br />Finally, a quick note about the V-22 Osprey, featured in this book as the U.S. Marine's new transport/attack aircraft. The Osprey was actually still being tested in 1999, and unfortunately two of them crashed in 2000, killing a total of 23 Marines. The latest information I can find about this aircraft is that the program is still on hold. <br /> <br />In conclusion, not one of Stephen Coonts' best books. The first half is intriguing but too hypothetical, the second half very exciting but a bit too weapons-oriented. Still, it is Stephen Coonts, and he is very good at writing exciting stories with inventive plots and populated with interesting characters. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-07-28
US	52823951	R4674B4V2YPXN	0099551810	729841986	Eagle Trap (Special Sale)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A very well-crafted, exciting and believable thriller	I enjoy reading thrillers, and my tastes tend towards military/action thrillers, techno-thrillers and international thrillers. At the moment Geoffrey Archer is my favorite author, and of the four Geoffrey Archer books I've read so far I consider \\"Eagle Trap\\" to be the best, and worth five stars. (I gave four stars to \\"Skydancer\\", \\"Shadow Hunter\\" and \\"Java Spider\\".) <br /> <br />There are two common problems that plague thrillers. <br /> <br />The first common problem is that in an attempt to make the story very exciting the author crafts a plot that is not believable. Things happen that are too unlikely, or people act in unrealistic ways, or there is a complicated sequence of many interdependent events that is too improbable when considered as a whole. Another possible cause of lack of believability is that the author talks about technological gadgets that he/she didn't really understand and makes mistakes that I, having some knowledge of technology, can see through. <br /> <br />The other common problem that plagues thrillers is poor characterization of the people in the story. The heroes are very brave and tough and the bad guys are extremely nasty and heartless, and they just don't come across as real people. They are two-dimensional clichs, nothing more. <br /> <br />\\"Eagle Trap\\" fortunately avoids both of these common problems. The story is very exciting and scary, and yet believable. And the characters are also believable and act like real people, especially the \\"good guys\\". <br /> <br />The story takes place in the early 1990's at the time of the breakdown of the Soviet Union. Two nuclear warheads being moved from Armenia to Russia are stolen and end up in the hands of an Arab gang leader in Lebanon. This Arab gang leader has a burning desire to revenge the death of his brother by inflicting a terrible blow on the British. Specifically, he intends to detonate a nuclear warhead next to the HMS Eagle, the British aircraft carrier that was involved in the bombing attack that killed his brother. <br /> <br />Geoffrey Archer's background as a journalist can be seen in his realistic (I assume) descriptions of various conflict areas around the Mediterranean. The hostilities between Russia, Armenia, Iraq, Turkey, the Kurds, Lebanon and Libya all play a certain role. Even the hostilities between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar come into play in the book, increasing the overall excitement. <br /> <br />Adding to the realism and excitement of the story is the fact that the hero, Capt. Peter Brodrick of the British Marines, is very human. He makes mistakes, misses observing things, is often very frightened, and lets his emotions get away with him occasionally. His girlfriend is also refreshingly appealing, with a disarming sense of humor and a simple-minded tenacity when the going gets tough. <br /> <br />There are many military action sequences for fans of this kind of material. Naval aviation operations on both the HMS Eagle and on the American aircraft carrier The USS Carl Jackson are described in detail. Operations by the British Marines on land and at sea also play a part in the story as does a Russian submarine that plays havoc with the plans of the British and the Americans. <br /> <br />On top of everything else there are even several surprising twists in the plot, and times when the best laid plans simply fall apart, just like in real life. There is a slow but sure increase in the suspense as we move towards the surprising climax. <br /> <br />To repeat what I said at the start of this review, \\"Eagle Trap\\" is the best of the four Geoffrey Archer books that I've read so far. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his books. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-07-23
US	52823951	R1F6VJQH11XWRZ	0751533777	107939415	The Hostage	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Do Special Forces guys need to want to be killers?	\\"The Hostage\\" is Duncan Falconer's first novel and is hopefully the start of a long series of books. I enjoyed it a lot and found it VERY exciting, although the believability of the plot is a bit of a problem.    The hero of \\"The Hostage\\" is Stratton, a member of the British SBS (Special Boat Service, similar to the U.S. Navy SEALs). Stratton, whose first name is not mentioned in this book, is the toughest of the tough guys, but still comes across as a real person. He's very focused and experienced and doesn't hold back from having to kill when killing is necessary.    In fact, the subject of Special Forces soldiers having to kill when necessary is one that is explored several times in the book. The message here is that, unlike ordinary soldiers, Special Forces soldiers need to feel a desire to get a \\"hit\\" on their experience sheet in order to be a success.    So does this imply that Special Forces soldiers are psychopaths? Or just very motivated to do a good job and become a success? Or perhaps a bit of both, along with a craving for excitement?    As mentioned above, the story in \\"The Hostage\\" is very, very exciting. In fact, this is one of the most exciting books I've read in a long time, and I'm a fan of military thrillers. Duncan Falconer is very good at creating suspense and building up to a climax, with lots of action along the way.    The \\"bad guys\\" are various members of the \\"Real IRA\\" of Northern Ireland. First they try to kidnap a member of the \\"detachment\\" that Stratton is working with in Northern Ireland, and come very close to succeeding. Then, in Paris, they do succeed in kidnapping an American sailor, a U.S. Navy SEAL working together with the SBS as part of an exchange program.    Finding and freeing the American sailor is a top priority for Stratton and his team until the Real IRA spring an even nastier surprise on the British government: They are in possession of a biological weapon that can kill millions of people and they intend to unleash it inLondon!    Duncan Falconer's own experiences as a former member of the SBS provides credibility to the descriptions of the action. Like Andy McNab and Chris Ryan (two former members of the British SAS who have become authors) he's been there and done that. (I've only read one of Andy McNab's novels and none of Chris Ryan's so I'm not in a very good position to make comparisons.)    The characters in \\"The Hostage\\" are very well developed and well presented, unlike the two-dimensional clichés that populate most action thrillers. Even the bad guys are shown to have understandable motives. For example, there is a love story between one of the bad guys and one of the women working with Stratton, and we understand the bad guy's feelings and the tragedy for both of them when their relationship comes to an end.    The really great excitement of the story and the well-developed characters had me close to awarding five stars to \\"The Hostage\\". What caused me to drop the fifth star and give four instead were various problems with the realism of the plot.    For example, the biological weapon is so potent that it would presumably wipe out the entire civilized world if unleashed. It would certainly spread from London to Ireland, and that makes it crazy for the Real IRA to consider using such a weapon.    And why did the Real IRA decide to use the American SEAL's wife as a courier? And why did Stratton make a two-hour drive to London when he could have gotten himself transported by a helicopter? And why didn't Stratton shoot the bad guy just before the final showdown? OK, then there wouldn't have been the very exciting final showdown, but, but ...    In conclusion, \\"The Hostage\\" is an action thriller that is well above the average. I'm looking forward to more of Duncan Falconer's books.    Rennie Petersen	2005-07-11
US	52823951	RO2JO0YOF6GHH	0553572423	328007521	The Fist of God	Books	4	26	27	N	N	The story of Saddam Hussein's secret weapon	\\"The Fist of God\\" is an international/military thriller based on the first Gulf War in 1991 (and the prelude in the last half of 1990), when the USA and a large number of coalition countries forced Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. I liked the book a lot, especially the first half. The last half of the book begins to drag, and one ends up feeling that it is too long and that Frederick Forsyth himself was a bit tired of it by the time he reached the end. <br /> <br />This story works very well at two levels - a high level conflict and various individual conflicts. The high level conflict involves Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the build-up to the Gulf War and the decisions being made by President Bush Sr. and Margaret Thatcher and the CIA and the British MI6. This conflict is very exciting, even though we know the final result: a coalition victory and Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. <br /> <br />The individual conflicts consist of the fights between the various good guys and the Iraqi soldiers and agents of the Iraqi secret service and Iraqi counter-intelligence. There are also some Israeli Mossad agents involved just to make things more complicated. <br /> <br />At the individual conflicts level the main good guy is Mike Martins, a British SAS soldier who is recruited by MI6 and who is inserted into occupied Kuwait and later into Baghdad. Mike Martins' adventures are certainly exciting enough, but it seems too contrived that the same hero gets sent on three different missions. In particular, pulling Mike Martins out of Kuwait to send him to Baghdad has the negative effect of making the Kuwait operation seem unimportant. Similarly, his escape from Baghdad just at the time when someone is needed for a third mission is too big a coincidence. <br /> <br />The basic story involves the British discovering that Saddam Hussein has some kind of secret weapon, code-named \\"The Fist of God\\". So then the British (and Americans) have to determine exactly what kind of weapon it is, andwhere it's located. The story is a bit farfetched, but not totally implausible, so it's easy to get involved and feel a desire to keep reading to find out what's going to happen next. <br /> <br />One thing I liked a lot was that certain historical facts are mixed into the story, although perhaps not in a completely accurate way. For example, the Canadian weapons expert Dr. Gerry Bull and his death in Brussels in the spring of 1990 are woven into the story. Similarly, the Manhattan Project (the American nuclear weapons effort during WW II) and the Oak Ridge laboratory play a role in the story, and I found the information presented to be very interesting. <br /> <br />Among the things I wasn't so happy about was the emphasis on the British involvement in the Gulf War. Yes, the British did play a significant role, but still the Gulf War was basically an American show. But to hear Frederick Forsyth tell it you'd almost think the Americans couldn't have gotten anywhere without the British, and he even has a scene where Margaret Thatcher tells President Bush to pull himself together and do something about Saddam Hussein! <br /> <br />Another negative aspect is the description of the third mission that the hero, Mike Martins, is sent on in chapter 22, the second-last chapter of the book. Frederick Forsyth tells about this operation in such a dry and factual style that it's almost like reading a telephone directory. I definitely got the feeling that Mr. Forsyth had gotten tired and just wanted to wrap up the story. <br /> <br />Still, I liked \\"The Fist of God\\" a lot, and recommend it, especially if you're interested in a fairly modern thriller interwoven with a major real-life conflict. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-07-07
US	52823951	RT0CCAIK9PUM9	0285636766	64466737	Sabre-Tooth (Modesty Blaise series)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	"All right, Princess, let's go an' win it."	Willie Garvin, Modesty's loyal partner, makes the above statement just as he and Modesty are about to set out on what becomes an incredibly harrowing and dangerous caper. Willie makes this statement to Modesty (who he calls \\"Princess\\") at a time when he and Modesty have already been dealt a severe blow - they have just discovered that they are not only fighting for themselves and the need to save the world, but must fight for the life of an innocent child who is dear to them. This makes it of utmost importance that they have to defeat the bad guys. <br /> <br />\\"Sabre-Tooth\\" is the second book in the Modesty Blaise series of books and was written by Peter O'Donnell in 1966. It is a direct sequel to the first book, with Sir Gerald Tarrant of the British Foreign Service sending Modesty and Willie out on another dangerous mission. <br /> <br />As usual for a Modesty Blaise adventure the bad guys are bigger than life and extremely nasty. Karz, the huge Mongol who has assembled an army of mercenaries in northern Afghanistan, is totally ruthless, but still not the most fascinating of the villains.  <br /> <br />That honor must go to \\"The Twins\\", a grotesque pair of killers who hate each other's guts but must endure each other's constant proximity to avoid insanity. This is because The Twins were once Siamese twins, and even though they were successfully separated, the separation was not viable due to a mutual psychological dependency. Now The Twins wear a harness that joins them at the shoulders, and they spend every minute of their lives linked together. <br /> <br />The high point of \\"Sabre-Tooth\\" is the fight to the death between Modesty and The Twins. How can Modesty, completely unarmed, survive in a fight against a four-legged, four-armed, two-headed killing machine? <br /> <br />The plot of \\"Sabre-Tooth\\" is fascinating, especially seen in retrospect after Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Peter O'Donnell's premise was that oil-rich Kuwait was a plum for thetaking, and that in 1966 Kuwait's military defenses were such that they could not withstand a surprise attack by an army of ruthless mercenaries with the amazing firepower of modern weapons. <br /> <br />The story of how Modesty and Willie infiltrate Karz' army of mercenaries and their attempts to derail the attack on Kuwait is developed with a sure hand. Peter O'Donnell shows himself once again to be a master storyteller. <br /> <br />In this book we are introduced to the American businessman John Dall, a recurring figure in many of the later Modesty books. Willie Garvin's fondness for obscure English words is also presented, another recurring element in the series. <br /> <br />In my opinion \\"Sabre-Tooth\\" is one of the best books in the Modesty Blaise series, and well worth five stars. The unique and powerful relationship between Modesty and Willie is presented in a wonderful way, and their forcefulness and drive in the face of huge odds is also great. <br /> <br />If I had to mention a couple of negative factors it would have to be the minor inconsistencies that a good editor should have caught. For example, Mr. Vaubois, head of the French secret service, is referred to as Lon Vaubois in the first half of the book and as Ren Vaubois in the last half. Similarly, one of the bad guys is referred to as both \\"Chief Recruiting Officer\\" and \\"Chief Security Officer\\" - on the same page, no less. <br /> <br />A few more negatives: Modesty and Willie spend so much time smoking that they come across as nicotine addicts. And the book, like all of the Modesty books, is too short. <br /> <br />Highly recommended; both this book in particular and the Modesty Blaise series in general, especially the first six or seven books in the series. <br /> <br />Incidentally, you may wish to take a look at my \\"So You'd Like To\\" guide about books by Peter O'Donnell. It includes a link to my MSN group about Modesty Blaise where you can find more information about this whole series of booksand an article entitled \\"Why I love the Modesty Blaise books\\". <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-06-26

Judged by the year when the story takes place, \\"The Intruders\\" is book number two, following \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", Stephen Coonts' first book.<br /><br />But Stephen Coonts did not write this book immediately following \\"Flight of the Intruder\\", published in 1986. Instead, \\"The Intruders\\" was published in 1994 following the publishing of four other Jake Grafton books: \\"Final Flight\\" (1988), \\"The Minotaur\\" (1989), \\"Under Siege\\" (1990) and \\"The Red Horseman\\" (1993).<br /><br />\\"Flight of the Intruder\\" was set in 1972 during the last part of the Vietnam War, while \\"The Intruders\\" is set in 1973, shortly after the end of the Vietnam War. (All of the remaining Jake Grafton books are set in contemporary time, i.e., around the time when they were published.)<br /><br />So what we have here is a young Jake Grafton who has done his stint in the Vietnam War and is still in the U.S. Navy. He's very unsure about what he should do with his life. He's courting Callie McKenzie (mostly by writing letters to her), but fears that he will not win her hand. He feels that he is not in control of his life, that the Navy is making all the decisions for him.<br /><br />Unlike all of the other Jake Grafton books (except to some extent \\"Flight of the Intruder\\") this book does not have any real story. A lot of things happen, but they are isolated episodes spanning an eight-month period, not a single continuous plot.<br /><br />Actually, the main story in this book is simply the story of Jake Grafton finding himself and making decisions about his life. Plus the story about his relationship with Callie, with its ups and downs.<br /><br />One of the things I liked best about \\"The Intruders\\" were the many descriptions of how naval aviation works. Flying high-performance planes from the deck of an aircraft carrier is a very exciting and dangerous endeavor, and Stephen Coonts describes it all in detail. The only slightly negative point is that these descriptions are somewhat dated now, since the aircraft have changed since 1973, and presumably the procedures too, to some extent.<br /><br />Stephen Coonts writes with wit and intelligence, and some parts of the book, where Jake and his buddies talk about life and death, are quite philosophical. There are also touching passages about what love really is, and interesting insights into the concept of leadership.<br /><br />Highly recommended. The lack of the fifth star is due to the silly adventure in the last five chapters, presumably added because the author or the editor or the publisher didn't think the rest of the book was exciting enough to be a Jake Grafton story.<br /><br />Rennie Petersenng high-performance planes from the deck of an aircraft carrier is a very exciting and dangerous endeavor, and Stephen Coonts describes it all in detail.

US	52823951	R2FWQR32REZICN	0754014339	699811911	Shadow Hunter (Windsor Selection)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Similar to "The Hunt for Red October", only better	\\"Shadow Hunter\\" is Geoffrey Archer's second book, published in 1989 towards the end of the cold war. Compared to \\"Sky Dancer\\" (Geoffrey Archer's debut novel) the writing style has become smooth and consistent. (\\"Sky Dancer\\" was very good for a first book, but the writing was somewhat uneven.)<br /><br />There are a fair number of similarities between this book and Tom Clancy's \\"The Hunt for Red October\\", published in 1984. Both stories involve a renegade submarine captain and the exciting underwater hunts and battles between the out-of-control submarine and other submarines and naval vessels from the same nation and enemy nations.<br /><br />In \\"Shadow Hunter\\" the renegade captain is British, the commander of the HMS Truculent, a British nuclear-powered attack submarine. He sets off on a mission of his own, sailing Truculent up along the coast of Norway and east towards the Russian naval bases around Murmansk, and ignoring orders from the British naval command.<br /><br />Why? It becomes obvious that the renegade captain is suffering some kind of nervous breakdown, but the reasons for this are not apparent until later. Nor are his intentions clear. Does he plan to wage his own private war on the Russian Navy? Will he inadvertently start WW III? Or does he have a completely different goal?<br /><br />In the mean time the Soviet General Secretary is manipulating a Russian Navy Admiral in an attempt to create a crisis that will strengthen his hand in the Soviet Politburo. The British are doing everything they can to prevent the captain of HMS Truculent from doing whatever it is he's doing. And the American Navy is also involved, playing their usual role in the constant show of force vis-&agrave;-vis the Soviet military powers.<br /><br />This mixture of various plot-lines results in a very exciting story.<br /><br />I find \\"Shadow Hunter\\" to be a better book than \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" because I think Geoffrey Archer is much better at making characters who are real people, not one-dimensional clich&eacute;s. This makes the book more believable and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />However, I do find certain aspects of the plot in \\"Shadow Hunter\\" to be rather unrealistic, and this is the reason for the lack of the fifth star. The idea of a submarine captain suffering a breakdown is an exciting and scary scenario, and was a good idea. (Even though I'm sure that the various navies of the world have contingency plans for the crew to handle the situation.)<br /><br />But what I can't accept is the refusal of the British to enlist the aid of their American allies, and to warn the Russians about what is happening. This just doesn't make sense, considering the terrible consequences of what the captain of HMS Truculent could do.<br /><br />In spite of this unrealistic element in the plot I really liked \\"Shadow Hunter\\" and recommend it, especially if you're a fan of techno-thrillers.<br /><br />Rennie Petersenok more believable and enjoyable to read.

The above quotation is uttered by Willie Garvin at the end of chapter 18 of \\"Modesty Blaise\\". Two chapters later the book is over, and readers can agree with Willie and conclude that this book is different. Enjoyably and intriguingly different.<br /><br />\\"Modesty Blaise\\" was Peter O'Donnell's first book, published in 1965 when he was 45 years old. Prior to that he had had a long career as the author of scripts for comic strips and writing short stories. In fact, the Modesty Blaise character was first launched as a comic strip in a London newspaper in 1963, so Peter O'Donnell had the background and major story elements well worked out when he wrote this book.<br /><br />This book became the first book in a series of 11 novels and two collections of short stories about Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin, Modesty's loyal and trusted companion.<br /><br />In this review I'll concentrate on certain aspects of the book \\"Modesty Blaise\\" itself, in the hopes that the reader already has a general knowledge of the whole Modesty Blaise series of books. If this is not the case then you may want to look at my \\"So You'd Like To\\" guide about books by Peter O'Donnell. It includes a link to my MSN group about Modesty Blaise where you can find more information about this whole series of books and why I love them.<br /><br />In \\"Modesty Blaise\\" the basic story is that Modesty, a former criminal, is recruited to the side of the good guys. She and Willie then go up against a ruthless team of bad guys and find themselves captured and scheduled to be killed. In order to survive despite the incredible odds against them they have to fight for their lives, using their fighting skills and their ingenuity.<br /><br />In this book Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin are introduced to us in a very effective way. In chapters one and two Willie is in serious trouble and Modesty rescues him, the relationship between the two of them made very clear by the way they interact.<br /><br />Also introduced in this book are Sir Gerald Tarrant, John (Jack) Fraser and Weng, three secondary characters who appear in many of the other books in the series. And we are introduced to Modesty's penthouse apartment overlooking Hyde Park in London and Willie's pub The Treadmill on the bank of the Thames near Maidenhead.<br /><br />The bad guys in the Modesty books are always very special. In this book the memorable villains are Gabriel (who has a penchant for watching cartoons when he's not sentencing people to death), McWhirter (Scottish henchman who jokes about torture) and Mrs. Fothergill (not too bright or attractive but very good with the unarmed combat). Mrs. Fothergill plays a very special role towards the end of the book - but I can't say how without giving too much away.<br /><br />This book introduces the special fighting techniques and weapons that are typical for the Modesty books. In particular, we're presented with Modesty's favorite weapon, the kongo, and Willie's throwing knives, plus a couple of unusual weapons invented by Willie.<br /><br />\\"Modesty Blaise\\" is a wonderful book, and a great start to the whole series, and I'm awarding it five stars. If the above information is not enough to convince you, please read my article \\"Why I love the Modesty Blaise books\\", which can be found on my MSN group about Modesty Blaise.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness I'll conclude this review with a few points that I found slightly negative about this book.<br /><br />The book, at 224 pages, is too short. It's over too soon and you're wishing there was more.<br /><br />I find some of the things Tarrant and Fraser do to be a tad too silly to be consistent with their positions. Examples: Tarrant complimenting Fraser on his articulation (pg 15), Tarrant expressing relief that a hotel chef has declined leaving his job at the hotel (pg 61), Tarrant worried about being made fun of by Modesty or Willie (pg 70-71 and 128), and Fraser pretending to be angry when talking to Boyd (pg141).<br /><br />Finally, in spite of Peter O'Donnell's desire to make Willie an equal to the other characters despite his lower-class background, I detected a condescending tone at times. Examples: \\"Willie had views\\" (pg 106), \\"and to Tarrant's surprise Willie carried his share with ease\\" (pg 127), \\"there was no patronage in his manner\\" (pg 129). (Page numbers refer to the original Souvenir Press edition.)<br /><br />Highly recommended. Read this book, and if you like it then you'll also like at least the next five or six books in the series. (After that the series declines a bit.)<br /><br />Rennie Petersenracters despite his lower-class background, I detected a condescending tone at times.

US	52823951	RMBMYZWV9PNX4	0743539869	143542066	Building Bridges: Stephen King Live at the National Book Awards	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Good for Stephen King fans to help explain their addiction	In 2003 the National Book Foundation in the USA awarded Stephen King a \\"Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters\\". This audio CD contains an introductory speech by author Walter Mosley followed by Stephen King's acceptance speech.  <br /> <br />The total time for the CD is approx. 30 minutes, including approx. 3 minutes of applause. Incidentally, the complete text of Walter Mosley's introduction and Stephen King's acceptance speech is available on the National Book Foundation's web site. <br /> <br />Walter Mosley's introduction, which is about five minutes, is very good. He talks about the relevance of \\"horror stories\\" to modern people living in a safe and civilized society. Because despite modern society being relatively safe and civilized there are still many risks - just watch the news on TV. Furthermore being a human being is inherently lonely and fraught with risks of many kinds. <br /> <br />This inherent riskiness of human life has the effect on some of us to seek out books that let us read about ordinary people confronted with horrifying experiences arising from ordinary situations. We find it comforting that even though horror may strike us, we will hopefully, like a person in a Stephen King book, find the strength to stand up to the horror and survive it. <br /> <br />Stephen King's acceptance speech is approximately 20 minutes. He starts by talking for 10 minutes about how he got started as an author, largely thanks to his wife Tabitha. This story is well-known to those of us who have read Stephen King's book \\"On Writing\\". <br /> <br />He then spends five minutes talking about how important it is for an author to be honest, to write what he/she really means and feels. Mr. King makes the claim that he never wrote for the money, and that he finds accusations that popular writers write for the money to be insulting. <br /> <br />Stephen King concludes his speech by talking about how popular authors are looked down on by the literary community. He says that it is important to \\"build bridges\\" between the authorship of popular fiction writers and literary writers. He mentions Elmore Leonard, Peter Straub, Nora Lofts, Jack Ketchum, Jodi Picoult, Greg Iles, John Grisham, Dennis Lehane, Michael Connelly and Pete Hamill. I'm assuming Stephen King is recommending these authors, although he doesn't actually say this. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that if you're hooked on Stephen King's books then listening to this CD is entertaining and provides some interesting insights. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-05-09
US	52823951	RBWFPYSMAH5FO	0553264907	977328985	The Devil's Alternative	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Good international spy thriller from the cold war era	\\"The Devil's Alternative\\" is a spy thriller from the end of the 1970's. The story pits the Russian leader (modeled somewhat on Leonid Brezhnev) against the American President (modeled somewhat on Lyndon Johnson) in a world crisis situation. At the same time the story is very European in that it is the British who just happen to have a spy with access to the Russian Politburo meetings. Also, most of the scenes that do not take place in the White House or the Kremlin take place in Europe. <br /> <br />The story is very exciting, although somewhat unrealistic. As usual, the good guys are trying to prevent World War III while the \\"hawks\\" in both the Kremlin and the White House can hardly wait to get going. The ending is somewhat contrived but on the whole the book is a very good read. <br /> <br />For someone reading this book nowadays it seems rather dated because of the huge changes in the world political and military situation since the 1970's. This can be considered either negative or positive depending on whether you are interested in the history of this era.  <br /> <br />The differences between then and now are amazing. At that time the Soviet Union and Russia were a world superpower. Eastern Europe was communist, Germany was divided, and West Berlin was an isolated non-communist island in communist East Germany. The major political and military conflict in the world was the efforts of the communist countries to try to convert the whole world to communism and the efforts of the non-communist countries to prevent this from happening. <br /> <br />All of the above facts play a major role in this story, so an understanding of the situation then being different from the situation now is brought forcefully home to the reader. <br /> <br />There is an interesting passage in \\"The Devil's Alternative\\": \\"One day, maybe not too long from now, the Russian empire will begin to crack. One day soon, the Romanians will exercise their patriotism, and the Poles and Czechs. Followed by the Germans and Hungarians. And the Balts and Ukrainians, the Georgians and Armenians. The Russian empire will crack and crumble, the way the Roman and British empires cracked, because at last the arrogance of their mandarins became insufferable.\\" (Page 410 in the paperback edition I read.) <br /> <br />Was Frederick Forsyth perceptive in writing this, or just lucky? My memory of that era is that not many people would have agreed with that prediction at that time. <br /> <br />What about the plot? In a book like \\"The Devil's Alternative\\" the plot is not so important - it is a vehicle for the characters to play out their conflict, and Frederick Forsyth is good at creating interesting characters who play out an interesting conflict.  <br /> <br />Some parts of the story are somewhat unrealistic. In particular, the ending is rather contrived and some of the technical details about the fictitious world's largest supertanker strike me as very improbable. It is because of these various problems with the realism that I'm giving \\"The Devil's Alternative\\" four stars instead of five.  <br /> <br />But for the most part the story is realistic enough for us to suspend our disbelief and let ourselves get excited, and even scared of the possible consequences of things going wrong. That's what makes this one of Frederick Forsyth's better books, and I can recommended it, especially if you want to relive the world political and military situation at the height of the cold war. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-05-07

Joseph Stiglitz, the author of \\"Globalization and Its Discontents\\", is a renowned professor of economics. From 1993 to 1996 he served on President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, and from 1997 to 1999 he was Chief Economist and Senior Vice President at the World Bank. Then in 2001 he won the Nobel Prize for Economics. <br /> <br />So Mr. Stiglitz' credentials are certainly in order. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Mr. Stiglitz' book does not do a very good job of conveying his opinions to the general public, which is presumably why he wrote the book. <br /> <br />\\"Globalization and Its Discontents\\" tries to be accessible to the average person but it fails in several ways. It is too academic to be easily readable, and at the same time not sufficiently documented, leaving the skeptical reader feeling unconvinced. And on top of it all the book is very boring and there is way too much repetition. <br /> <br />In other words, I'm not disagreeing with Joseph Stiglitz' message (it sounds reasonable to me, although I don't feel qualified to judge complex economic questions), but I find the message very poorly presented. Which is a shame, as the message is a very important one that deserves the attention of all of us, and our attention should hopefully influence the policies of international finance. <br /> <br />Too academic? The book is not a research article, but it still includes an index, footnotes and notes at the back. Which is OK for me, but my guess is that this will make the book intimidating for much of the intended audience. <br /> <br />Too poorly documented? A large portion of this book consists of descriptions of various economic problems in various places in the world during the 1990's, and how poorly these situations were handled by the IMF (International Monetary Fund). But it is all presented in very general terms, and there are no hard facts or precise details or tables of comparative numbers. So you feel that you have to take Mr. Stiglitz' descriptions on trust to a larger extent than should be necessary. <br /> <br />Too boring? This is perhaps the worst failing of \\"Globalization and Its Discontents\\". My estimate is that the ratio of people who start reading this book vs. the number who actually read it to the end is probably at least 4 to 1. Which is unfortunate, as the last chapter, in which Mr. Stiglitz presents his recommendations for how the conditions for international economy should be changed, is the most important part of the book. <br /> <br />What Mr. Stiglitz should have done was to tell a certain number of very specific stories that illustrate the message that he is trying to get across. Stories about real people and real companies, with exact dates and details and numbers. This would provide the excitement and interest to make people keep reading, while increasing the credibility of the message. <br /> <br />For example, tell the story of the Russians who took over the natural gas production and how they became billionaires. Tell the story of a certain Indonesian family whose small business was destroyed by the IMF's policies and the consequences for them. Tell the story of a real-estate magnate in Thailand and how he went from rags to riches and back to rags again. People want to read about people, not vague talk about how the GDP in Indonesia went down by 10%. <br /> <br />As mentioned above, Joseph Stiglitz is very critical of the IMF. In fact, he is very, very, very critical of the IMF, with page after page placing the blame for serious economic problems on the IMF's policies.  <br /> <br />The copy of this book that I read included an \\"Afterword to the Penguin Edition\\". In it Mr. Stiglitz describes the launch of the hardcover edition of the book at the World Bank on June 28, 2002: \\"... representatives of the [IMF] decided to engage in an ad hominem attack, to the embarrassment not only of the economists at the World Bank who had come to see real engagement, but also to the IMF stafferswho attended. The IMF attack gave those who were there a chance to see firsthand the IMF's arrogance and disdain for people who disagree with its perspectives.\\" <br /> <br />Too bad there isn't a Nobel Prize for mudslinging. If there was then Joseph Stiglitz and the IMF could probably share it at the next presentation ceremony. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-04-08

When the author finally typed \\"THE END\\" he/she sat back and thought, \\"The readers will love this! They'll laud the hero for being so ingenious and forceful, and they'll laud me for having written this masterpiece!\\" <br /> <br />In reality, after reading \\"THE END\\" most readers will put down the book and think, \\"Too contrived! The plot is too contrived and the confrontation too unlikely. The chances of everything happening the way the author describes it are nil!\\" <br /> <br />Examples of the contrivedness (is there such a word?) of the story in \\"Avenger\\": <br /> <br />- The bad guy is in 2001 a high-powered international arms dealer who flies around in his own private business jet, yet in 1995 he was the militia leader of a ragtag group of 10 drunken thugs. <br /> <br />- The bad guy has a supposedly high-security fortress-like hideout, except that he prefers to have 1500 \\"residents\\", most of whom are forced laborers who do farming, including food processing and running a butchery, implying to me a security nightmare. <br /> <br />- This high-security fortress-like hideout is protected in various ways, but something as simple as motion detectors or IR sensors are not used. <br /> <br />- The good guy is a 51-year-old Vietnam veteran who just happens to have previously befriended two people who have the very special talents he now needs to help him in his confrontation with the bad guy. <br /> <br />As well as being too contrived the story is too slow. The entire first half of the book is mainly just background information for the story. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I think that some of the background information is the most interesting part of the book. I was especially fascinated by the descriptions of the \\"Tunnel Rats\\" in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War and by the explanations of the breakdown of ex-Yugoslavia and the various wars there. <br /> <br />One rather interesting twist in the story is the date on which the story ends: Sept. 10, 2001. It's not really significant to the story, but it does make you think about the stakes involved. <br /> <br />In conclusion I'll just echo what many of the other reviewers have said: Not one of Frederick Forsyth's best, but still fairly readable. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-03-21

The \\"hero\\" of the story is Jake Grafton, in some ways Stephen Coonts' alter ego. Jake is a U.S. Navy pilot flying missions over Vietnam in an A6 Intruder, a carrier-based attack bomber. This is exactly what Stephen Coonts himself was doing at that time, making the book somewhat autobiographical. It also makes the story and the descriptions sound totally authentic.    The strength of the book is this authenticity and the fact that Stephen Coonts has strong feelings and opinions about how the Vietnam War was being fought. These feeling and opinions are presented via the characters, especially Jake Grafton.    Jake Grafton is portrayed as a very real person with very real conflicts and problems in his life.    On one hand Jake is proud to be a warrior fighting to defend his country. On the other hand he is disgusted by the mass killings that his bombings cause, and hates what he is doing.    On one hand Jake believes in the warrior code of \\"keeping the faith\\" with his fellow warriors and his superiors in the military. On the other hand he feels that the U.S. military has been betrayed by the political leaders who are the highest command in a democratic country's military hierarchy.    The missions that Jake flies are extremely dangerous. First he has to dodge flak and missiles over Vietnam while flying so low he risks hitting the ground, and then he has to return \\"home\\" to a dangerous carrier landing at night in bad weather.    The ultimate paradox in Jake's life is that he is so brave and self-controlled that he has been given the call sign \\"Cool Hand\\". But at the same time he is suffering from so much stress that he has developed palsy, a tremor in his hands.    The descriptions of the combat operations are fantastic. Stephen Coontsreally brings to life the hell of flying through flak and dodging missiles and the terror of night-time carrier landings in miserable weather. At the same time the book also contains great descriptions of the joys of flying when the weather is beautiful and no dangers are being faced. Stephen Coonts' love of flying and his real-life experiences during the Vietnam War are what makes the book really appealing.    The only real criticism I have is that there is a major plot element that is a mistake. Jake decides to bomb a target in Hanoi in violation of orders. This is unnecessary from the literary point of view - the book would have been better without this escapade. It is also a mistake from the point of view of the characters - Jake doesn't really seem like someone who would do such a dumb thing.    A few final notes:    The book is currently out of print, but is well worth looking for in used book shops or on the Internet.    This book was the first in what became a series of ten \\"Jake Grafton\\" books written by Stephen Coonts, many of which I recommend. I especially like \\"The Minotaur\\" (1989) and \\"Liberty\\" (2003).    A movie was made based on this book. It's fairly good, although the editing is a bit uneven.    In summary, a very good first book, and a good start to an interesting series of books, many of which I recommend.    Rennie Petersen	2005-03-05

Many of his books have been translated into other languages, and \\"Den Serbiske Dansker\\" (\\"The Serbian Dane\\") has been translated to English, French, German, Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian.<br /><br />The main person in \\"The Serbian Dane\\" is Vuk, a young Bosnian Serb who was born and grew up in Denmark but later became a sniper in the turmoil of ex-Yugoslavia. For reasons that I never really understood, Vuk agrees to return to Denmark to assassinate an Iranian author who has been sentenced to death by the Ayatollahs in Iran. (A bounty of four million US dollars is involved, but Vuk claims repeatedly that he doesn't kill for money.)<br /><br />There are two \\"good guys\\", Per Toftlund, a security specialist with the Danish national police (corresponds to the American FBI) and Lise Carlsen, a journalist with one of Denmark's largest newspapers. The two of them fall in love (typical for a Leif Davidsen thriller - there has to be a romance), although I found this to be rather silly. Lise Carlsen, in particular, does not come across as a person who is particularly loveable.<br /><br />But the most interesting person in the book is Vuk, and he is also the person that most of the pages in the book focus on. Everything that Vuk does and thinks is described in detail, often excruciating detail.<br /><br />We are told, step by step, about how Vuk travels from Bosnia to Copenhagen via Warsaw and Berlin. Vuk's past is slowly revealed to us as he wanders around Copenhagen, surprised by the changes that occurred during the short number of years that he was away. Vuk contacts one of his childhood friends, and more of his past is revealed, in particular his traumatic experiences in ex-Yugoslavia. We finally begin to understand why Vuk is the way he is.<br /><br />The story slowly but surely moves towards the climax, too slowly in my opinion, but this is again typical for Leif Davidsen. Will Vuk succeed in killing the Iranian author, or will the police, who are aware of him and his intentions, succeed in capturing him?<br /><br />This is a very Danish book in some ways, in that many of the things that are discussed are primarily of interest to Danes. It is not as good as most of Leif Davidsen's books, but it still manages to get four stars by my standards, mostly because I like the way Leif Davidsen describes people and social situations so well.<br /><br />Two minor nit-picking criticisms:<br />- The childhood friend is described as a total nerd who has a poster of his hero Bill Gates on his wall. Real nerds don't like Bill Gates.<br />- Vuk goes shopping for diving equipment and gets an \\"oxygen\\" tank. Should be a compressed air tank.<br /><br />In summary, not one of Leif Davidsen's best, but still a good thriller, especially for a Danish reader or for those interested in modern Europe.<br /><br />Rennie Petersenhim and his intentions, succeed in capturing him?

US	52823951	R3CFPY3ZKJIPHR	0312283628	300670880	Liars & Thieves	Books	3	20	24	N	N	Stephen Coonts writing like Mickey Spillane	\\"Liars & Thieves\\" (published as \\"Wages of Sin\\" in Europe) is a quite different book from the Jake Grafton series that made Stephen Coonts famous. Personally, I don't like the change in style.    I'm a fan of thrillers, especially international thrillers and techno-thrillers. I like most of Stephen Coonts' books and consider them to be \\"the thinking man's thriller\\", a notch up on the intellectual scale from Tom Clancy, for example.    \\"Liars & Thieves\\" is different from the Jake Grafton series in many ways. To start with, the main character is Tommy Carmellini, a CIA operative who plays a secondary role in the last four Jake Grafton books.    Tommy Carmellini reminds me of Mike Hammer, the fictional hero of Mickey Spillane's books. He's physically big, he's tough and doesn't shun violence, he's great with the fast-paced repartee and he doesn't claim to be all that smart. Women find him attractive (what's with these silly women anyway?) and he beds them without much emotional involvement. And he tells his story in the first person.    Fortunately, Stephen Coonts is not 100% loyal to the first-person style. As the book progresses there are more and more passages that tell parts of the story that Tommy Carmellini can't tell because he's not at that location.    There is a lot of violence in this book, something that doesn't particularly appeal to me. The body count rises slowly but surely through the story, with Tommy personally killing 13 of the \\"bad guys\\"! These shootouts and other fights are described in detail, and are exciting at first, but about half way through the book it gets tedious.    The romantic (to use the word very loosely) subplots are very minor. Tommy succeeds (without trying or particularly enjoying it) in bedding three of the female characters. But if Tommy doesn't really care much one way or the other, why should we?    The weirdest scene in the whole book is when Tommy makes love to one of the women in a bugged hotel room, knowing that his best friend is monitoring the bugs! The fact that he doesn't particularly like the lady in question just added to my incredulity!    A general problem with the whole book is that the characters are poorly presented and not very believable. Surprising, considering that Stephen Coonts is otherwise very good at writing books populated with real people.     In particular, Tommy Carmellini doesn't come across as a believable person. To make it worse, he isn't a person that I find all that appealing. He's great at shooting holes in the bad guys and making clever remarks, but I'd prefer a leading \\"good guy\\" who is smarter and displays more real human characteristics.    On the plus side, the plot is pretty good. The story is partly based on the real-life defection of Vasili Mitrokhin, the KGB archivist who arrived in Great Britain in 1992 with six suitcases of notes from classified KGB files! Mix this with an American presidential nomination and people in high places with a past that is damaging to their political careers and you have an exciting cocktail.    Still, the good plot can't compensate for the disappointing characters and the repetitive violence, so I'm only giving three stars to \\"Liars & Thieves\\".    Rennie Petersen	2005-02-16
US	52823951	R1B2MBM9SHKHM6	0712677208	178808716	Java Spider (Deleted)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Faking a honeymoon with someone you don't know	\\"Java Spider\\" is an international thriller set in London and on a fictitious Indonesian island. Author Geoffrey Archer, who has experience from that part of the world, writes vivid accounts of how the repressive forces in Indonesia crush dissident movements. East Timor is mentioned as an example, and this book was published two years before the independence referendum in 1999 that resulted in an Indonesian scorched earth campaign that practically destroyed that country. <br /> <br />So the setting for \\"Java Spider\\" is scary to start with, and the vile events that take place and the descriptions of the \\"bad guys\\" add to the threatening mood of the book. <br /> <br />The story is about a British government Minister who is kidnapped in Indonesia, and then mistreated in an attempt to force the British government to do what the kidnappers want. But it's not clear who the kidnappers are, and there are hints of corruption in high places back in London. <br /> <br />A thriller needs one or more \\"good guys\\", and these roles are filled by Nick Randall and Charlotte (Charlie) Cavendish. Nick is a police detective with Scotland Yard and a former Army man with Far East experience. Charlie is a young but very ambitious reporter for a small London TV station. <br /> <br />The things I look for in a thriller are a good (believable) story set in an interesting environment, i.e., an environment that I can learn something about that I didn't know before. And I want the characters in the story, both the good guys and the bad guys, to resemble real people. <br /> <br />\\"Java Spider\\" meets my desires on all of these points. Especially the environment (Indonesia) and the characters are good. Nick and Charlie, the classical odd couple, are likeable and flawed, just like real people. <br /> <br />Only the story is a bit of a letdown. It's very exciting, high marks for that, but not very realistic or believable. <br /> <br />A high point in the story is when Nick and Charlie pretend they'renewlyweds on their honeymoon, despite the fact that they don't really know each other (yet). Anything to confuse the opposition! <br /> <br />In summary, I liked \\"Java Spider\\" and am looking forward to reading more of Geoffrey Archer's thrillers. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2005-02-08
US	52823951	R3IB4JVC19GR5F	0451213467	750839879	Shadows of War	Books	4	20	21	N	N	Poor Brick, he missed out on the second Iraq war	\\"Shadows of War\\" is the fourth book in Robert Gandt's great military action series featuring Sam \\"Brick\\" Maxwell, U.S. Navy pilot and squadron commander, flying an F/A-18 Super Hornet off the USS Ronald Reagan.    Here's a quick summary of the four books.     2001: \\"With Hostile Intent\\", dogfights over Iraq, spying in Iraq, bad eggs in the U.S. Navy.     2002: \\"Acts of Vengeance\\", dogfights over Yemen, ground battle in Yemen, submarine attack in the Gulf of Aden.     2003: \\"Black Star\\", dogfights over China and Taiwan, commando raid in China, naval battles around Taiwan.     2004: \\"Shadows of War\\", dogfights and dodging missiles over Iran, POW exchange and ground operations in the Iran/Iraq border area.     All four of these books are very exciting, and if you're a fan of military action stories then I'm sure you'll like them.     \\"Shadows of War\\" is set in the aftermath of the 2003 war in Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein. There is no mention of Brick having participated in that war, so I guess he missed it because of his tour of duty in the China area. :-)     (It must be difficult to be the author of military action books. The audience wants stories based in real-life situations, but reality sometimes changes too fast to allow the fictitious hero to keep up.)     I liked the first half of this book a lot, and found myself reading page after page with great interest and anticipation. There are several interwoven story lines, including not just conflicts between the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys\\", but also serious internal feuding among both the good guys and the bad guys.     Unfortunately, in the last half of the book the plot becomes too contrived. A POW exchange is set up in a situation where the more logical solution would be to send in the special operations guys to rescue the American POW. Even more contrived is the way the POW exchange works out, and the consequences (or lack of consequences) for Brick Maxwell.     A major plus point in Robert Gandt's booksis the level of detail and authenticity with which the flying scenes and combat operations are described. Mr. Gandt makes you feel that he really knows what he's talking about, and that makes his books very satisfying.     So here we have the unfortunate contradiction: Great realism in the action descriptions and not-so-great realism in the general story.     Another detraction (and contrived aspect) is the way the husband of Brick's girlfriend had a major role in the story, and especially the way he kept turning up every time Brick and the girlfriend had a date. The entire romance story is unnecessary in my opinion (this is a military action book - who needs romance?), and trying to add excitement to the romance story by having the husband pop up repeatedly struck me as silly.     Still, the pluses outweigh the minuses, and that's why I'm giving four stars to \\"Shadows of War\\", along with my recommendation.     Rennie Petersen	2005-01-31
US	52823951	R3N7IHL66JU0C4	0072229438	325917845	Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Complete Reference, Second Edition (Osborne Complete Reference Series)	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Covers too much, and doesn't cover anything in depth	This book is entitled \\"Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Complete Reference\\", but a more accurate title would be \\"Making web sites with Dreamweaver MX 2004 and a bunch of other tools: The Incomplete Reference\\".    The situation is that the authors do not focus exclusively on Dreamweaver MX 2004. They include lots and lots of information about many other things, but they don't go into anything in the depth necessary. Most of the things they cover can be considered an appetizer or introduction, but if you are going to use that particular tool then you will need to buy a book that really covers that tool.    For example, there's a chapter about PHP that is 42 pages. This is just enough information to allow you to become dangerous, i.e., you could end up making your web server vulnerable to hackers. The authors tell you how to install the CGI version of PHP but not the module-interface version that has fewer security issues, and they don't discuss the various security problems inherent in PHP in any depth. Only 5 of these 42 pages have anything to do with Dreamweaver. My advice: If you're going to use PHP then get a book about PHP.    Similarly, there is a two-page discussion of how to install Microsoft IIS 4.0! There are whole books describing how to install and run IIS! It would be much better if the authors simply said, \\"If you need to install IIS then consult the Microsoft documentation or get a book on this subject.\\"    Of course, IIS 4.0 is now obsolete, but that's not the point. The point is that the authors try to cover much too much and end up with a few random facts and no in-depth coverage of anything.     A later part of the book discusses the WebDAV protocol briefly (one page), but the authors don't mention that Dreamweaver cannot use WebDAV with IIS, even though Microsoft claims that IIS does support WebDAV.    Part V of the book consists of 8 chapters (200 pages) and is called \\"Adding Database Features to your Site\\". There are chapters on database design and on the SQL language. Once again, this is a good introduction to the subject, but what does it have to do with Dreamweaver?    Occasionally one gets the impression that information has been added to this book simply to increase the page count in the hopes that potential buyers go for the book with the most pages. For example, there are three pages about the history of the Internet!    Despite all of the above negative stuff I did find this book to be a good introduction to the many things it discusses. If the authors had given the book a more accurate title, for example, \\"A Comprehensive Introduction to Building Web Sites, Featuring Dreamweaver MX 2004\\", then I would have given it four stars.    But I thought I was buying a book about Dreamweaver MX 2004, and as such this book is disappointing.    Rennie Petersen	2005-01-14
US	52823951	R9080IAVIMOKI	0451207181	422761336	Acts of Vengeance	Books	4	15	15	N	N	Really great action, excitement and suspense!	\\"Acts of Vengeance\\" is the second book in Robert Gandt's \\"Brick Maxwell\\" series of novels, and the best one of the three that I've read so far. There's lots of really great combat action, lots of excitement, and a plot that provides quite a bit of suspense.    The action takes place in and around Yemen in the Middle East, where Brick Maxwell is commanding a squadron of F/A-18 Hornets flying off the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan. In addition to the usual conflicts between the American forces and some local \\"bad guys\\" there are also some serious conflicts between various American interests. In other words, some of the \\"good guys\\" are causing just as many problems as the \\"bad guys\\".    Combat scenes are taking place in the air, on the ground, and at sea. There are some great dogfights between the American F/A-18 Hornets and F-14 Tomcats on one side and some Russian-built MiG-29 Fulcrums on the other side. Meanwhile, a Marine Expeditionary Unit has been ambushed on the ground and is fighting for its life against a much larger number of attackers. And last but not least, out in the Gulf of Aden a Russian-built Kilo class submarine is silently stalking the USS Ronald Reagan, getting ready to fire four torpedoes at point-blank range!    The description of how the submarine slowly closes in on the unsuspecting USS Ronald Reagan provides some of the best suspense I've experienced in a military combat novel in a long time. And Robert Gandt's descriptions of all of the various kinds of combat ring true, making it all the more exciting.    On the other hand, the plot is pretty unrealistic for several reasons, and this detracts from the enjoyment of the story. To start with, the idea of Americans who are willing to cozy up to an Arab revolutionary leader who is responsible for the death of two US Navy Admirals and an American ambassador is pretty crazy.     Another plot element that wasn't explained (or else I missed it) is the question of who was financing this Arab revolutionary. Operating a private army isn't cheap, especially when they have six MiG-29's and loads of high-tech weapons and communications gear, etc. So where did the money come from?    Also on the negative side is the fact that the characters are rather stereotyped. This is par for the course for military action thrillers, but Stephen Coonts has demonstrated that it's actually possible to write techno-thrillers populated with real people.    The bottom line is that the positives far outweigh the negatives. So if you like military action books with lots of excitement and suspense then I can recommend Robert Gandt's \\"Acts of Vengeance\\".    Rennie Petersen	2005-01-05
US	52823951	RMUFHNC722ZX3	0671748882	490730863	The Red Horseman	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Stephen Coonts flying high at a low altitude	The high point of \\"The Red Horseman\\" is the aerial dogfight between Jake Grafton (flying a Russian Su-25 \\"Frogfoot\\") and four Russian Su-27 \\"Flankers\\", with most of the action taking place below 200 ft. altitude! Stephen Coonts is very good at writing about this kind of combat, and you really feel that you're right there in the cockpit with Jake. <br /> <br />This book is the fifth or sixth (depending on how you number them) book in the Jake Grafton series. By now Stephen Coonts had established himself as a worthy competitor to Tom Clancy, and in my opinion his books are better than Clancy's. In particular, the characters in a Stephen Coonts book are real people, and people you enjoy learning more and more about. <br /> <br />In the first two-thirds of \\"The Red Horseman\\" the story unfolds slowly, but satisfactorily, as an international political thriller. Jake, now a Rear Admiral in the American Defense Intelligence Agency, is sent to Moscow to help monitor the Russian dismantling of their nuclear warheads. The CIA is also involved, but not in the way we would expect, and of course some warheads go missing. <br /> <br />The last third of the book becomes a techno-thriller. The hunt is on to retrieve the missing warheads and to ensure that no more will be stolen. In addition to the great dogfight mentioned above there is a very detailed description of how a major military operation to secure an enemy airfield would be done nowadays. <br /> <br />I found this last section of the book to be the most interesting and exciting part. The whole thing is rather unrealistic, but the reader is willing to ignore that because it's so exciting. Unfortunately, I thought that the ending was a bit too far out, and this is part of the reason for the lack of the fifth star. <br /> <br />Also on the negative side, I found Stephen Coonts opinion of post-glasnost Russia overly derogatory. He has his characters saying \\"nothing works here\\" and \\"Russia is on its way to the stone age\\" so many times it becomes silly. This is especially true with the hindsight we have now that Russia did survive the Yeltsin era and is slowly but surely becoming a developed country by western standards. <br /> <br />A very interesting sub-plot in \\"The Red Horseman\\" involves the death of a British newspaper mogul named Nigel Keren. Stephen Coonts has very clearly modeled Nigel Keren on the real-life Robert Maxwell. Even their dates of death are identical! <br /> <br />In conclusion, a very good techno-thriller, up to the usual Stephen Coonts standards. If you like military techno-thrillers with lots of political skullduggery, then this is for you. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2004-12-30

The hero (?) of \\"Lime's Photograph\\" (\\"Lime's billede\\" in the original Danish) is Peter Lime, a 50-year-old successful, but alcoholic, paparazzo who experiences a terrible tragedy.     Why did it happen? What does Peter Lime do to determine the cause? Will he be able to get on with his life after the tragedy?    Despite the fact that an alcoholic paparazzo is not someone most of us can identify with the story works and we are caught up in it and keep reading to find out the secrets behind the terrible events. This is because the book is well-written and the story is fascinating, especially if the reader has an interest in modern European history and was young in the 1960's.    It's all there: the hippie movement of the 60's, the cold war, the socialist movement, the death of Franco, the KGB, the Stasi, the ETA, the IRA, the EU, the fall of the Berlin wall, the re-unification of Germany, bullfighting, globalization, Hemmingway. It's a very European story, taking place in Spain for the most part (Madrid and San Sebastian) but with some parts happening in Copenhagen and Berlin and Moscow.    Leif Davidsen's characters come across as real people and he spends a lot of time (too much, perhaps - the story drags at times) talking about human nature and philosophizing about human relationships and growing old and the tragedy of war. Still, I prefer a thriller that drags because of being too realistic than a thriller with cardboard clichés and no realism.    I did have one major problem with \\"Lime's Photograph\\". One of the \\"bad guys\\" is obviously based on a known Danish woman who caused a scandal in Denmark in the late 1990's, although the character in the book is a very distorted version of this person. I don't think it's proper to make fictional characters that are so obviously based on real people, and especially not when they are made far more sinister than the real person.    This review is based on two \\"readings\\" of the book: Several months ago I listened to the audio version in the original Danish read by Leif Davidsen himself, and recently I read the English translation. I can mention that although it's always interesting to hear a book read by the author, that Mr. Davidsen is unfortunately a very poor reader. As for the English translation, it is quite good - one doesn't feel that one is reading a translation. I did have the Danish book available while I was reading the English translation and I made a few comparisons without finding any mistakes.    Highly recommended if you like realistic thrillers based in Europe and especially if you were young in the 1960's.    Rennie Petersen	2004-12-20

The story centers around a British scientist who is the chief designer of a new kind of cluster warhead for the submarine-launched Polaris missiles deployed by the British Navy. The Russians are out to steal this \\"secret\\" so they can design a defense against this new weapon. The story ranges from high-level political decision-making to the nitty-gritty of spy craft.    What makes the book especially good is that the plot has several unexpected twists and that the characters seem like real people with real weaknesses. There are plenty of \\"bad guys\\" and \\"mediocre guys\\", but no real heroes. There is also a lot of (presumably authentic) information about submarine warfare (shades of \\"The Hunt for Red October\\") and how spies entrap their victims. A highlight is an exciting description of a meeting between the British scientist and his Russian opposite number at the Berlin wall. (The story takes place just before the end of the cold war.)    My biggest criticism is that the kernel of the plot (the scientific \\"secret\\" and the attempted deception to hide this secret) isn't viable. However, this is a typical failing of international thrillers involving a struggle over some scientific gizmo, so you have to take the plot with a grain of salt and pretend that it works.    My second criticism is that this book starts very slowly, and the characters seem cliché-like at first. In fact, when I was a third of the way into the book I was considering dropping it! I'm glad I continued reading.    Finally, I found the moral conflict between the British scientist and his wife to be too strong to be realistic. If the wife really thought her husband, because of his job, was practically a mass murderer, wouldn't she have left him long ago?    Despite this list of negatives the book really appealed to me after I got past the slow beginning.     Rennie Petersen	2004-09-13

(By the way, this book has two different titles: \\"Running Blind\\" in the USA and Canada, and \\"The Visitor\\" in the UK and elsewhere.) <br /> <br />To start with the positive stuff, I love Lee Child's writing style. I'm a fan of thrillers, and this means I'm used to fairly mediocre writing, so this book was a very nice change. <br /> <br />The basic idea behind Jack Reacher's character is also interesting. He's a sort of vigilante Robin Hood, righting wrongs around him that the normal forces in society don't take proper care of. And he's not just muscle and weapons and fighting techniques, he's also very intelligent and knowledgeable and observant. <br /> <br />I also liked the basic story line, with a serial killer who has the FBI outsmarted and a motive that will come as a surprise.  <br /> <br />So all-in-all I found the book appealing in many ways. <br /> <br />But now comes the list of problems that I have with this book, problems that are sufficient that it's doubtful if I'll ever get around to reading another book by Lee Child. <br /> <br />The characters aren't really believable. Jack Reacher is supposed be a loner, but not wanting to own anything other than a folding toothbrush must be a bit problematic. Lisa Harper is having problems with sexual harassment in the FBI so she gives up wearing a bra.

US	52823951	R1DLG2T7ZJ5DHU	0735614202	120014529	Internet Information Services (IIS) 6  Resource Kit (Pro-Resource Kit)	Books	3	29	31	N	N	IIS 6.0 Resource Kit for Dummies?	My biggest objection to this book is the tone used by the authors in talking to the reader. Presumably this is a book that will be bought and used by professional persons with an above-average intelligence, but the feeling I get when reading many passages in this book is that the authors are talking down to someone who they don't expect to be very bright.    There is a lot of repetition and a lot of trying to describe something that is intrinsically complicated in a way to try to make it sound simpler than it is. This is presumably done because the authors are afraid that the reader will otherwise not be able to follow the descriptions at all.    Another thing that I don't like about this book is that references from one place in the book to another place do not use page numbers. Here's a typical example:     'For more information about how to back up the Web server, see \\"Back Up and Restore the Web Server to a File or Tape\\" in \\"IIS Deployment Procedures\\" in this book.'    Because there isn't any page number reference you have to go to the table of contents and find \\"IIS Deployment Procedures\\" (which is an appendix) and then scan the contents of that appendix for \\"Back Up and Restore the Web Server to a File or Tape\\", and then you find the page number.    Another problem is that you can't be 100% sure that what it says in this book is correct. I haven't found all that many errors, but I have found a few.    For example, on page 10 it says, \\"When IIS is installed, it is locked down by default so that it can serve only static content.\\" This is not true, at least not for Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, which has ASP support enabled by default.    Another example: On page 22 it says, \\"When you complete installation of Windows Server 2003, Manage Your Server automatically starts.\\" This is not true, at least not for Windows Server 2003, Web Edition.    Two CD-ROM's are included with the book. One CD contains an evaluation version of Windows Server 2003. The other CD contains several searchable online versions of IIS documents and Help files, and 14 IIS tools. Incidentally, you don't need to buy this book to obtain the tools, as they are also available for download on Microsoft's web site.    This book contains a huge amount of very detailed information about IIS 6, and if you really need this information then this book is \\"the only show in town\\". My advice though, is to consider carefully if you really need all this advanced information, or whether you can perhaps get along with one or two of the less comprehensive books about IIS 6.

US	52823951	R3TUR9MFHMLO0	0312335164	201960968	Digital Fortress: A Thriller	Books	4	5	7	N	N	The bad guy dies too soon	I like Dan Brown's thrillers because they're fast moving and have interesting plots with surprising twists and with puzzles that have to be solved. Also, the main protagonists are intelligent and educated people, and the stories, at least in part, take place in an environment where educated people interact. <br /> <br />Another attraction with Dan Brown's books is that the stories delve into fields of learning that are interesting. In \\"Digital Fortress\\" it's cryptography and computing, in \\"Deception Point\\" it's politics and the physics of materials, and in \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" it's the history (and present state) of the Roman Catholic Church. <br /> <br />\\"Digital Fortress\\" really appealed to me because of the interesting twists in the plot. It's not too difficult to guess who the bad guy is, but he and the other characters all spend most of the book working against each other under false pretenses! A pretty neat trick! <br /> <br />But even though I liked \\"Digital Fortress\\" a lot I'm withholding the fifth star. There are several reasons... <br /> <br />Firstly, the bad guy died rather prematurely in chapter 105. The story then continues for an additional 23 chapters to a climax, but a climax where the good guys are locked in combat with a computer virus inexorably counting down to doing some digital nastiness. This just isn't as captivating as a man-vs.-man climax. <br /> <br />Secondly, I was turned off by Dan Brown's introduction of the main protagonist, Susan Fletcher: <br />\\"Susan stared in amazement.\\" (pg 44) <br />\\"Susan's jaw dropped.\\" <br />\\"Susan was flabbergasted.\\" (pg 45) <br />\\"Susan almost fell out of her chair. 'What?'\\" (pg 47) <br />\\"Susan gaped.\\" <br />\\"'What?' Susan collapsed back in her chair.\\" (pg 48) <br />Is this really how Dan Brown thinks a 38-year-old woman with an IQ of 170 and holding a top-level job at NSA (National Security Agency) acts? Good grief! <br /> <br />Thirdly, if you, like me, know a lot about computersthen you'll find it very annoying that Dan Brown got so many technology things wrong. There are simply tons of computer-related errors in the plot details.  <br /> <br />The most blatant mistake is the idea that an encryption program that only exists as a file encrypted by itself (the non-encrypted encryption program had been willfully erased!) could be retrieved if you knew the pass-key! This corresponds to having a safe and locking one of the two keys inside the safe and then destroying the second key - the safe can never be opened even though one key still exists! <br /> <br />Still, \\"Digital Fortress\\" is an exciting thriller and I became quite engrossed in it, despite the various problems I had with the plot and the characters. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2004-08-23
US	52823951	R2LLMW8EHNTO0V	0312989709	472844485	Liberty (Jack Grafton, Book 10)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Jake Grafton retires - and does it in style!	This book was written in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 tragedy, and is very much influenced by that event. The story is somewhat reminiscent of Tom Clancy's \\"The Sum of all Fears\\": terrorists are smuggling nuclear weapons into the USA in an attempt to destroy western society.  <br /> <br />I liked this book a lot. It's true that the book is colored by Sept. 11 and by the desire to have a story with real heroes doing heroic things and to paint the Islamic terrorists in as negative a way as possible. But despite this Stephen Coonts created a story that is quite thought-provoking, very scary, and featuring a fair number of \\"good guys\\" who are not as lily white as they first appear to be. <br /> <br />Another interesting aspect of the story is the picture that is painted of the political infighting between the politicians and the various organizations such as the CIA and the FBI and the military. Everyone should be working toward the goal of combating the terrorists, but in reality many people are working on their own private agendas. <br /> <br />The story is very complicated with a large number of characters and with several subplots. Unless you have a very good memory I'd recommend that you create a written roster of characters as you read the book, noting vital facts for each person and noting the pages they appear on. Then, when you realize that you're not sure if a character has already been presented or not, it's easy to look in your roster and see. <br /> <br />My roster of characters for Liberty ended up covering four pages with some 45 names on it! It was very satisfying being able to cross off the names of most of the bad guys as they met with violent ends. Of course, some of the good guys also lost their lives. In all, 18 entries in my roster ended with \\"killed on page xxx\\"! <br /> <br />In summary, a very exciting book with interesting subplots, unexpected twists in the story and good characters. My only criticism is that the lack of panic in the general population does not seem realistic - my guess is that if it became known that nuclear weapons were being smuggled into American cities that it would result in massive fleeing from the cities to the countryside. <br /> <br />This is the 10th and (presumably) final book in the \\"Jake Grafton series\\", with Jake announcing his retirement at the end of the book. Stephen Coonts has started a new series of novels starring Tommy Carmellini, another indication that it's unlikely that we'll see any more \\"Jake Grafton books\\".  <br /> <br />So far I've read six of these 10 Jake Grafton books, have written reviews for all of the books I've read, and intend to read the remaining books if/when I get a hold of them. In other words, I recommend the series quite strongly. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen	2004-08-08
US	52823951	RX5G0E9KA9YS	0743406273	949583629	Firewall	Books	3	17	17	N	N	If James Bond were a masochist...	If James Bond were a masochist his name would be Nick Stone.  <br />  <br /> Nick Stone lives in an old dump of a house with a hole in the roof. He eats junk food and sleeps in seedy hotels and drives around in an old wreck of a car. He acts subservient to idiots and endures his boss who puts him on ice and insults him. He gets involved in one &quot;mission impossible&quot; after another, all of which end in fiasco. He gets beaten up repeatedly and eats aspirin like candy to keep the pain down. He trudges for hours through snowstorms and freezing weather and almost dies of exposure.  <br />  <br /> In other words, Nick Stone isn't just an anti-hero; he comes across as a total loser. And whenever he's given the choice he always chooses to do things the hardest way possible and suffer the consequences.  <br />  <br /> So why read a book starring Nick Stone? Because Nick Stone, despite everything I've just said about him, is the ultimate survivor. When the going gets tough (and this happens regularly) Nick Stone comes out of the confrontation alive and the bad guys are either dead or incapacitated.  <br />  <br /> Furthermore, you have the feeling that it's all real. Andy McNab was in the British SAS, and when he writes about Nick Stone you feel that everything is completely authentic. Everything that happens is described in detail and with a down-to-earth grittiness. The weapons and the explosives and the fights and the agent tradecraft are being written about by a man who really has the experience necessary to write about these things with authority.  <br />  <br /> Another plus factor is that Nick Stone, who tells the story in the first person, is not just taciturn, stoic and self-effacing; he's also sarcastic and good at poking fun at the world around him. It's a kind of black humor, but it suits the tone of the story and makes the book more enjoyable.  <br />  <br /> For non-British readers I feel the need to point out that this book is written in British Englishwith a lot of British slang. This is something that I find appealing but that can result in difficulties occasionally. For example, &quot;Winning the fight isn't important, it's having the bottle to get stuck in that is.&quot; (page 281) I had to query a message board frequented by British people to get a translation to ordinary English, which is roughly, &quot;It's more important to have the right attitude, the toughness, when going into a fight than whether or not you win the fight.&quot;  <br />  <br /> This is the first Andy McNab novel that I've read, and I'll conclude this review by admitting that I have ambivalent feelings about the book. I love the authenticity of the story telling and the belief in himself that Nick Stone shows no matter what happens. But why the heck does a man with his abilities and talents always have to choose to do things the hard way and end up living like a bum and getting involved in jobs that always go terribly wrong?  <br />  <br /> Rennie Petersen	2004-07-30
US	52823951	R1NAW2YHK5HHNV	0596003161	520797446	Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference (2nd Edition)	Books	5	25	26	N	N	An amazing book!	I bought this book to learn how to create a new menu system for a web site that I'm working on, and I certainly don't regret the choice. Danny Goodman's book does a very good job of covering Dynamic HTML (DHTML), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), DOM (Document Object Model) and even JavaScript. <br />  <br /> The amount of information in this book is incredible. 1400 pages! (Not 1500, as currently indicated at Amazon.com, incidentally, but 1400 is sufficient.) <br />  <br /> Mr. Goodman explains the current situation, where Microsoft's Internet Explorer follows one &quot;standard&quot; and the other browsers follow the W3C standards to varying degrees. He also indicates which version of MS IE first began to support each feature, allowing you to decide whether you want to use some feature that some of your clients' older browsers may not support. This kind of information is invaluable if you want to make your web site cross-browser compatible, including support for Macintosh, Unix, Linux, etc., as well as Windows. <br />  <br /> My only criticism is that the book is unfortunately becoming a bit dated. It was published in Sept. 2002 so it obviously can't contain any information about the latest versions of web browsers. On the other hand, Microsoft has not released any new version of IE for over two years, so it's only information about the latest versions of Netscape and other browsers that is missing. <br />  <br /> One additional thing I liked about this book was that Danny Goodman sometimes uses an almost poetic English, something rather unusual in a technology book. A couple of examples from page 19: &quot;... can be a challenge unto itself.&quot; &quot;If the inexorable flow of new browser versions...&quot; <br />  <br /> Highly recommended if you are making web pages that require the use of Dynamic HTML. <br />  <br /> Rennie Petersen	2004-07-23

Character development is not all that great, but above average for a techno-thriller.<br />The best parts of the book are the fantastic descriptions of aerial dogfights and naval battles. Surprisingly, I thought that some of the battle scenes between various Taiwanese and Chinese naval vessels were more exciting than the aerial shoot-outs. Robert Gandt is good at making both kinds of combat scenes come alive.<br />My criticism about the lack of realism in the plot concerns the mission launched by the U.S. and Taiwanese military to steal an advanced Chinese stealth fighter. This sounds pretty crazy to me - I'm sure that in a real wartime situation that the allied forces would decide to simply destroy this aircraft. After all, the Chinese built this airplane using plans (stolen from the USA) for a corresponding American airplane. Why risk major loses trying to steal military &quot;secrets&quot; that you already have?<br />Still, it's an audacious undertaking and the story of how the mission works out is very exciting.<br />Another plus point is that there is some humor in the story. For example, there's an Air Force Major who fills the role of providing comic relief.<br />On the other hand, an additional minus point is that a totally unnecessary extra conflict takes place in the last chapter.<br />If you like military techno-thrillers about naval warfare in general and especially about naval aviation then I'd like to recommend this book.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-07-09
US	52823951	R2YLM7XO5V5AD0	0425155722	35064043	The Fool's Run (Kidd)	Books	2	15	18	N	N	Good story if you don't mind that there are no &quot;good guys&quot;	I like reading thrillers. I like to get drawn into an exciting story about a conflict between one or more &quot;good guys&quot; and one or more &quot;bad guys&quot; - preferably including some gals in the top roles. I love it when the plot includes unexpected twists, and I like it when the background for the story includes authentic information of interest that I wasn't aware of before. Finally, I like it when the top characters are well developed and believable, and I can identify with one of the good guys and boo and hiss the bad guys.<br />&quot;The Fool's Run&quot; passes most of my tests for a good thriller. I found the book quite exciting and I did feel captured by the story - I read the book in only two sittings.<br />And yet, here I am giving it only two stars.<br />After I finished reading &quot;The Fool's Run&quot; I sat back and realized that I didn't particularly like the &quot;good guys&quot;. In fact, it can be argued that this story does not include any &quot;good guys&quot;.<br />The hero, Kidd (who has no first name), is a Vietnam veteran who paints pictures, practices karate, consults tarot cards and is a computer programming wizard. He accepts a job to basically smash a company by infiltrating their computer system and slowly but surely destroy the company's ability to function. Payment? Two million dollars!<br />Our hero recruits several others to help him in this endeavor. LuEllen (who has no last name) is a cocaine-snorting cat burglar. But she's OK, because she only steals from rich people. She and Kidd have a loose relationship because neither of them is capable of committing themselves to a real relationship.<br />The other two team members are Dace, a down-and-out journalist who admits that the only reason he isn't a drunk is that he's allergic to alcohol beyond a threshold amount, and Bobby, a hacker and phone phreak who is able to exploit the telephone lines and network connections and break into any computer system.<br />The first part of the book tells how first Kidd is recruited, and how he then recruits the three others, and how the four of them then go to work to destroy the company that has been targeted. Then the story gets more complicated and even more exciting.<br />But this can't really be considered to be a &quot;good guys&quot; vs. &quot;bad guys&quot; story. Instead, what we have is simply &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot;.<br />The fact that Kidd and Co. are willing to destroy a company in order to obtain a lot of money just doesn't appeal to me, even though they justify the project in various ways. I'm guessing that the fact that the targeted company is fairly large makes the crime seem more acceptable to many people. It's not like Kidd is trying to put a mom and pop grocery store out of business - or is it?<br />In addition to my lack of sympathy for the &quot;good guys&quot;, I also have a problem with the lack of realism in the descriptions of how the hacking was carried out and how the targeted company reacted to the hacking. Kidd's device for taping telephone lines is not viable, descriptions of how all the data files that the team received were promptly printed out on paper is ridiculous, and in reality a company that was attacked as described would have sooner or later simply restored their entire system from the backup tapes.<br />One thing to be aware of is that this book was first published in 1989, and this makes the descriptions of the computer technology very dated. The Internet isn't mentioned (although it did actually exist at that time) and there aren't any mobile telephones or e-mail or CD-ROMs or Windows, etc. PC's are all IBM AT's or Kaypro IBM-compatibles, they communicate with mainframe computers using Hayes modems and dial-up telephone lines, and Lotus 1-2-3 is mentioned. To me this doesn't detract from the story in any way; in fact it made me feel very nostalgic. But if you weren't involved with PC-based computing in the 1980's you may find these descriptionsrather strange.<br />A final point that should be mentioned is that this is the first Kidd/LuEllen book in what has become a series. Warning: For some strange reason there is incorrect information on this subject in various editions of this book. For example, in the edition that I read it says on the page inside the front cover that the author (whose real name is John Camp) has written &quot;two previous Kidd novels.&quot; There are apparently other editions of this book where on the jacket it says that &quot;Kidd and LuEllen return&quot; in this book. But on John Sandford's official web site he makes it very clear that this IS the first Kidd/LuEllen book.<br />Rennie Petersenrather strange.<br />A final point that should be mentioned is that this is the first Kidd/LuEllen book in what has become a series.

US	52823951	R3TWMLDOCOUVYE	0425180093	72854739	The Sixth Fleet	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Good story, but be warned that you have to buy the sequels	There are several positive things to say about &quot;The Sixth Fleet&quot; by David E. Meadows. The story is quite exciting and the combat scenes seem to be realistic. Especially the descriptions of how men react under attack have an authentic quality about them, and this makes the book enjoyable to read.<br />That said, I do have three major problems with &quot;The Sixth Fleet&quot;.<br />First problem: The story is not complete. I was aware that &quot;The Sixth Fleet&quot; was the start of a series of books, but I didn't realize that the story in this book ends abruptly in the middle of the build-up to a major conflict, so you have to buy the next book in the series or be left dangling with everything unresolved.<br />The fact that the story is incomplete means that many of the characters in the book make their appearance and are described in detail and prepare to take part in the story - and then are not mentioned again! What happens with SEAL Captain Duncan James and his side-kick and their newly acquired female cohort? What will happen to the President of Algeria? Why does the author give us detailed descriptions of how the U.S. President reacts to the initial attacks by the enemy, but not to the more serious later attacks? Hopefully, all of these characters return in volume two, but their fragmentary appearances in this book are very unsatisfying.<br />OK, perhaps you're willing to buy the next book in the series, and maybe even like the fact that the story is big enough and complicated enough that it needs several volumes. If so, please ignore the previous two paragraphs.<br />Second problem: The entire story is based on a &quot;what if&quot; scenario set in the indeterminate future. The premise is that American military might has been seriously diminished due to budget cut-backs in the USA, and at the same time Europe has become USA-antagonistic.<br />The fact that the story is based on this &quot;what if&quot; scenario makes the book less appealing for me.For one thing, I don't think that the proposed scenario is very likely to occur, and anyway, even if it does occur someday, I'd prefer a story that is based on something resembling here-and-now reality.<br />Also, putting the story in the future results in weird situations like this: &quot;I will be the most powerful man in the Arab world, Colonel Alqahiray said to himself. And even more worshiped than old Saddam, who still manages to hold on to power at his age.&quot; (pg. 18)<br />Third problem: The author has no knowledge of modern data-based communications systems, etc. This implies that he should have gotten some expert help when writing the parts of the story that involve these systems. Instead, he resorted to techno-babble, assuming that the readers were just as poorly informed as him. This works for most readers, but for those of us who know the difference between techno-babble and creative extrapolation / modification of real technologies it leaves the impression that the author just couldn't be bothered doing the right thing.<br />For example, the author claims that GPS (Global Positioning System) satellites are in geo-stationary orbit (they aren't). He also implies that tampering with the GPS satellites so that GPS receivers show incorrect coordinates would not result in an almost immediate global alert about the problem. There is also confusion between the public telephone / telefax system and computer-based messaging systems. Descriptions of how computer viruses work are completely crazy, etc., etc.<br />On one level this can be brushed off as nit-picking. Who cares if the author's descriptions of data communications are accurate or not? But the problem is one of credibility. I've caught the author faking some aspects of the story, so then I have to wonder if he's also faking the descriptions of naval combat scenes and aerial dogfights?<br />So even though Mr. Meadows left me curious (and frustrated) with his cliff-hanger ending of &quot;The Sixth Fleet&quot;, I'm not planning on buying the next book, despite the positive aspects of this book.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-06-13

Sorry about the title of this review, but I just couldn't resist. I was engrossed in reading Ice Station and remarked to my wife, &quot;Do you think that killer whales would eat U.S. Marines?&quot; My wife, with a perfectly straight face, replied, &quot;Oh, no, killer whales prefer SEALS!&quot; <br />Ice Station is the third Matthew Reilly book that I've read, and I must admit that I didn't like it as much as the other two. I think that a certain &quot;Matthew fatigue&quot; has set in: Mr. Reilly's super-charged action style was fascinating at first, but after a while it gets a bit tedious. <br />In addition, I think that Ice Station is even more unrealistic than either Temple or Area 7, which is saying quite a lot considering how unrealistic all of Matthew Reilly's books are. Especially the diving sequences are totally crazy: diving to 3000 feet, diving bells that are open to the sea at the bottom and yet implode when a window is damaged, pills that prevent the blood from absorbing nitrogen, etc., etc. <br />Matthew Reilly wrote Ice Station when he was 23 years old and going to university, and I think that it shows in that this book is not as well researched and the tone is a bit immature. Both Temple and Area 7 had a more polished feel to them. <br />Despite my negative comments I must say that I liked the plot and think that Matthew Reilly is very good at creating and developing an imaginative story line. In fact, I wish that he'd tone down the non-stop action and instead concentrate more on the story, with treachery and surprising twists and turns, and many competing forces, each with their own agenda. <br />This book introduces Lieutenant Shane &quot;Scarecrow&quot; Schofield of the U.S. Marines, and tells the story of his background. Scarecrow returns in Area 7 and Scarecrow, and if you intend to read any of these books it would be an advantage to read them in the correct order. <br />In conclusion, lots and lots of non-stop (totally unrealistic) action. The three stars are mostly for the clever story line, which unfortunately is somewhat buried in the never-ending action sequences. <br />Rennie Petersen	2004-06-08
US	52823951	R36O3YJY30VYCL	0672322978	90816603	Sams Teach Yourself JavaScript in 21 Days	Books	4	15	15	N	N	Great for beginners, too slow for experienced programmers	I found this book very useful, and I was able to learn JavaScript from it, although I didn't follow the book's tutorials sequentially.<br />The most important thing to note is that this book is not really suitable for an experienced programmer who wants to add JavaScript to the list of programming languages that he/she knows. If you already know several other programming languages then you'll find the pace of this book much too slow. There are too many simple examples and too much discussion of basic programming principles.<br />For a beginning programmer these many examples and down-to-earth discussions are great. The authors assume that the reader has no knowledge of programming at all, which is fine if the reader is new to programming.<br />A couple of the especially useful things I found in this book were an example showing a clever way of using the onClick event for an &quot;a&quot; tag, and information about where to find the Microsoft script debugger.<br />On the other hand, I did find a few minor errors. And on page 20 a CD-ROM is mentioned, but in fact no CD-ROM accompanies the book. Instead, as explained on page 5, the sample files from the book are available on the Internet.<br />So if you're new to programming then this is a good book for you, but if you're an experienced programmer then you should find something else.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-06-01
US	52823951	R27NM2SSILAUHM	0451204867	814697610	With Hostile Intent	Books	4	9	9	N	N	A great first novel in the &quot;Top Gun&quot; tradition	Robert Gandt's first fictional book is very good, and I'm looking forward to reading the other books about &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell, the U.S. Navy pilot who is the hero of &quot;With Hostile Intent&quot;. I'm a sucker for techno-thrillers that focus on naval aviation, and Robert Gandt does a great job of writing about life on an aircraft carrier and what it's like to be a pilot of an F/A-18 Hornet.<br />The story takes place in the Middle East, with the U.S. Navy (and U.S. and British Air Forces) enforcing the &quot;no fly zone&quot; over southern Iraq. The year is 2000, 10  years after Desert Storm but before the Iraq war in 2003, so Saddam Hussein is still in power and playing the role of super bad guy.<br />The major conflicts in &quot;With Hostile Intent&quot; are, however, not the ones between the U.S. and Iraqi forces. Instead, we have several members of the U.S. forces who are so egotistical and ruthless that they provide the greatest threat to the &quot;good guys&quot;. (I don't know how realistic this is - for the sake of the U.S. Navy I would hope that people like that would be weeded out very early in their naval career.)<br />One of the things I liked best about this book were the descriptions of aerial dogfights between the F/A-18 Hornets and MiG-29 Fulcrums. Sidewinders are flying, high G turns being done to evade missiles, chaff and flares being ejected and there's lots of excited chatter between the pilots. &quot;Fox two!&quot; &quot;Bandit on your six!&quot; &quot;Splash one!&quot; Great stuff for us armchair warriors!<br />So why the lack of a fifth star?<br />Mostly because the plot is a bit too contrived and thus not very plausible. In order to maximize the conflict between &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell and &quot;Killer&quot; DeLancey it's necessary for Brick to refuse to reveal something he knows about Killer, but without a reasonable ground for this refusal. Then at the end of the book there's an even more contrived situation, which I'll refrain from talking about here.<br />Also, the characterizations of the people in the book are rather &quot;wooden&quot;, especially in the first part of the book. <BR> <BR>Still, I'm definitely looking forward to following &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell in his further adventures, as chronicled by Robert Gandt.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-05-28
US	52823951	RLU35HCQLHO3I	0440207428	149244382	The Minotaur	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Spy catcher meets techno-thriller	This is the sixth Stephen Coonts book I've read, and the first one that I liked so much that I'm giving it five stars.<br />&quot;The Minotaur&quot; combines two main stories that are cleverly interwoven with each other.<br />Story 1: There's a traitor, code named Minotaur, somewhere high up in the Pentagon who is channeling America's top military secrets to Moscow. Amazingly, the Russians don't know the identity of this mole, so not just the FBI but also the KGB are feverishly doing everything they can to find out who this traitor is.<br />Story 2: The U.S. Navy is in the midst of a procurement project to obtain a new attack aircraft to replace the aging A-6 Intruder. The new airplane will be based on stealth technology, including a top-secret device to actively suppress radar reflections.<br />I found the procurement story to be especially interesting. There's a lot of presumably authentic inside information on how the U.S. military handles the procurement of a major weapons system. The political skullduggery involved was fascinating, with a high-ranking U.S. Senator manipulating the process in an attempt to get the contract awarded to a company in his state. This Senator was more interested in his own re-election than in whether the Navy got an optimal, or even usable, aircraft!<br />Mixed up with the two main stories are a fair number of sub-plots, most of them concerning the lives and personalities of various people in the book. These sub-plots display Stephen Coonts' talent for creating characters who are real people, not the cardboard clichés that populate most techno-thrillers.<br />Overall, the most enjoyable aspect of this book is the way it draws you into the story and makes you want to learn what's happening behind the scenes and why. Who is the Minotaur? Why is he (or she) passing secrets to the Russians? Will he/she be stopped?<br />Unless you have a very good memory, I would recommend that you create and maintain a list of the main characters in thebook. Otherwise, things can become rather confusing, and your chances of guessing who the Minotaur is will be minimal.<br />There are some very exciting descriptions of the test flights involved in the procurement project, first with a modified A-6 Intruder and then with two different prototypes of the new stealth attack airplane. These narratives, and some general descriptions of the joys of flying, are an added attraction in &quot;The Minotaur.&quot; Stephen Coonts' background as a pilot and flying enthusiast is obvious here.<br />If you like techno-thrillers populated with real people, and if you are interested in flying and especially in military aircraft, then I'm sure you'll like &quot;The Minotaur.&quot;<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-05-19

I read parts of two other books about IIS 6.0 too, and comparing these three books I'd put this one in the middle in terms of how helpful I found it.<br />In general I think this is a pretty good book. The author seems to know his stuff and is good at explaining things, and the subject matter is well organized.<br />You should be aware that this book covers only the administration of IIS 6.0. It does not include any information about how to install IIS 6.0 or anything about creating web applications. <br />One thing I liked is that the book includes a chapter about the Indexing Service, something that I notice is not mentioned at all in the other two books I've read about IIS 6.0. I expect to be using Indexing Service later, and appreciate that it is covered here.<br />The chapter about setting up and administering an FTP site did not include any example showing how to best do this when FTP is to be used to upload material to a web site. On the other hand, the book did include the necessary warnings about the security issues involved, and it did include enough information so that I was able to figure out the best setup within the given limitations. So this book is still better than the other two books I read about IIS 6.0 concerning this point.<br />A few random quibbles:<br />- There's a mistake on pages 5 and 11 where it says that IIS 6.0 is not installed by default when Windows Server 2003 is installed. That's not true for Windows Server 2003 Web Edition.<br />- Figure 3-3 on page 51 is incorrect.<br />- References from one place in the book to another place do not use page numbers, only chapter and section titles, making it harder to find the place being referenced. (But apparently all modern IT books are like this. Is it because the same formatting is used for an eBook version?)<br />In conclusion, thisbook is too big to really be a &quot;pocket consultant&quot;, but within its limited scope it does a very good job.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-05-14
US	52823951	R14XR5VJ1BS2VV	0765340240	959103132	Goliath	Books	3	4	8	N	N	This book suffers from an identity crisis	Goliath tells a very exciting story that keeps you reading despite all the faults, and I see Steve Alten as a fairly good writer who does provoke you and who presents many interesting ideas. <br />But what kind of book is Goliath?<br />Is Goliath a techno-thriller with many battle scenes involving high-tech weaponry? In particular, are there several submarine vs. submarine battles reminiscent of &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;?<br />Or is Goliath a science fiction book set in the near future (2009) and containing many futuristic devices and an artificial intelligence computer somewhat like HAL in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;?<br />Or is Goliath an action novel starring an ex- U.S. Army Rangers officer who survives many fights due to his training and strength and knowledge of weapons and explosives?<br />Or is Goliath a horror story with blood-dripping scenes involving humans getting limbs ripped off, being chained down and having the top of their scull surgically removed, and having electrodes attached to their exposed brain? Is there a scene where a person gets electrocuted, with a graphic description of what happens to his body that would make Stephen King proud?<br />Or is Goliath a sociological treatise with long discussions between the characters as to the causes of war and violence, and many debates about what can be done to make humans better people and to reduce human suffering?<br />The answer, unfortunately, is that Goliath is ALL of the above. And to me it is a problem when an author tries to mix five different styles into one book.<br />Even if you do happen to like books that combine the many different styles mentioned above I don't think you'll find Goliath all that great a book. The story seems too contrived and there are too many aspects of the plot that are just too incredible and illogical.<br />A few examples: Pacifists who propose using violence and death to eradicate violence, a man who says &quot;you were like a son to me&quot; to theman he used to send on high-risk missions, and a computer scientist who doesn't get worried for his own safety when he discovers that the computer has killed one of the other crew members.<br />There is also a bit too much of a self-righteous tone to the whole book.<br />And then there are the many annoying detail errors that a good editor should have caught and corrected. I'll just mention a few, but there are more:<br />Pg. 33: Rocky expelling air from her lungs - not possible.<br />Pg. 288: Depleted uranium very radioactive - no.<br />Pg. 293: &quot;most of Afghanistan had been wiped off the map&quot; - no.<br />Pg. 323: &quot;I found the Chaw&quot; - no he hadn't - and the name is spelled wrong.<br />In conclusion, my advice to Steve Alten would be to focus on only one or two book styles instead of spreading himself over five styles in one book. And I think he should find a better editor.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-05-07
US	52823951	R1RG3OS25O5TWZ	0072224959	64799147	IIS 6: The Complete Reference	Books	4	39	42	N	N	Not completely complete, but pretty good	I haven't read all of this book yet, and I probably never will, considering that some of the chapters are irrelevant once you've decided on which programming platform you are going to use. But what I've read so far I like.<br />This book is somewhat unusual in that it discusses two normally separate topics: setting up and administering IIS 6.0, and basic server-side programming techniques. <br />Concerning the part about setting up IIS, I was pleased to discover that the book also includes some very useful information about how Windows Server 2003 should be installed and set up to ensure good basic security. I've read two other books about IIS 6.0 and neither of them had this kind of material.<br />My one quibble is the lack of information about how to set up an FTP server for use in uploading and maintaining the content of a web site. OK, I know that FTP is an obsolete technology for doing this, but still, it is the traditional method, so a simple example showing the best way of doing this would have been nice. (On the other hand, the two other books I've read about IIS 6.0 didn't cover this either, although one of them included enough information to allow the proper technique to be figured out.)<br />Turning to the server-side programming part, there are examples of simple applications using the following technologies: ASP, COM, ASP.NET, ATL and ISAPI. The book does not include a CD-ROM but one of the authors has a web site from which you can download all of the sample files, 19 MB in all. <br />Two final criticisms: There is no mention of possible alternative programming platforms such as Perl, PHP, MySQL, etc., and where to find them. And some of the screen shots have a resolution that makes the text almost impossible to read.<br />In conclusion, if you're involved in both setting up an IIS 6.0 web server and in creating a web site to run on it then you'll find this book very useful.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-05-01
US	52823951	R2BUK6Q5CI5ZJD	0312983220	931157258	Area 7 (Scarecrow Series)	Books	4	11	15	N	N	More than just action, action, action	&quot;Area 7&quot; is a thriller containing an incredible amount of high-octane action. This huge amount of action, and the lack of realism in many of the things that happen, requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief on your part if you want to enjoy the book. <br />But there's more to &quot;Area 7&quot; than just page after page of action. <br />True, most of the book consists of action scenes with bullets flying everywhere and things exploding and a fantastic line-up of various groups of really nasty bad guys who are all out kill the good guys (and each other) in the most violent and horrifying way possible.<br />It's also true that the story is not particularly believable, nor are the characters very well developed. The bad guys in particular are nothing more than cardboard figures, and the good guys aren't much better when it comes to resembling real people.<br />But Matthew Reilly keeps you reading despite these weaknesses because he has a couple of tricks up his sleeve. <br />The plot is actually pretty interesting (despite being unrealistic), and there are a large number of imaginative plot elements and very creative twists and turns. Several times after you thought you'd worked out what's going on you discover that things are more complicated and the bad guys are more devious than you realized.<br />I especially liked the start of the book, where the leading bad guy, U.S. Air Force General Charles &quot;Caesar&quot; Russell, is executed in Leavenworth prison for treason and murder. But the execution doesn't &quot;take&quot; - as soon as his dead body is delivered to his Air Force cohorts they revive him! And at the same time we're informed that the newly inaugurated President of the USA has some kind of super-miniature electronic device implanted on his heart! <br />From there on the book goes somewhat downhill until around the middle, where the plot becomes better fleshed out and we realize that things aren't as simple-minded as we originally thought. It's because of these clever developments in the story line that I'm giving &quot;Area 7&quot; four stars instead of the three that I'd been planning for most of the book.<br />I'm also giving plus points for the many drawings and maps that make it more interesting to follow the action. And I like the fact that several of the good &quot;guys&quot; are actually good gals, and that they're just as tough and ingenious as their male comrades.<br />At the end of the book there's a seven-page interview with Matthew Reilly, and I must admit that I like this sort of thing because I like reading about how authors go about creating the books they write.<br />In conclusion, if you like imaginative (albeit unrealistic) thrillers with lots of action, action, action, and are willing to almost totally suspend your disbelief, then &quot;Area 7&quot; should entertain you.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-04-19

I'd have given it 4 or 5 stars and thought that the 22-year-old hero, Rip Cantrell, was \\"too cool for school\\", as Rip himself puts it.<br />Unfortunately (?), my age is such that I review books based on how I think most adults will see them, and I'm afraid that results in me labeling this book as being \\"juvenile\\" and giving it only 3 stars.<br />Rip Cantrell finds a real genuine flying saucer buried in the sands of Northern Africa. Together with a couple of other guys he digs it up. The flying saucer is 140,000 years old! And it still works!! All it needs is some fuel, which happens to be plain water!!! <br />A pretty woman turns up and Rip demonstrates his savoir-faire by insulting her. \\"Do you really like him or just need sex?\\" he asks her when she admits that she has had something going with the guy she's together with. We can rest assured that this love-at-first-sight relationship will blossom and become a major driving force in the story.<br />Everyone wants the flying saucer, especially the American military and an Australian media mogul (very loosely based on Rupert Murdoch), and both are willing to use serious force to get what they want. Soon Rip and the pretty girl are on the run, flying the saucer on a fantastic journey across continents and oceans. And then things start to get really exciting.<br />After the public becomes aware of the existence of the saucer there is widespread panic. The military and the politicians are all up in arms, and are depicted as being a bunch of idiots. So it's not just exciting but also rather humorous at times.<br />Actually, the book presents a fairly good story, and I liked it. But the tone is definitely juvenile. And what is one to make of a statement like this: \\"This thing is so damn up-to-date that it hasn't been invented yet.\\"<br />Not a book that makes you think very hard, but a good fun read, especially if you haven't had your 20th birthday yet.<br />Incidentally, on Stephen Coonts' web site he says that he's working on a sequel.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-04-15
US	52823951	R2YRQXEYFHKHSV	0671742949	78886547	Under Siege	Books	4	24	24	N	N	A non-techno thriller with people-like people	Under Siege is the fourth or fifth (depending on which way you put them in order) book that Stephen Coonts has written about his fictional hero Jake Grafton. It's a good read, both because it explores a scary scenario about what could happen if Columbian drug lords terrorized Washington DC in the same way they terrorize Columbia, and because it details the lives of some very believable people who are involved in the conflict.<br />Unlike some of the later Jake Grafton books, Under Siege doesn't feature much in the way of high-tech weaponry. Instead, it features a large cast of characters from all walks of life and describes them in ways that make them seem real and allow us to empathize with them.<br />This book is a thriller, of course, and the story is certainly suspenseful and exciting. A Columbian drug lord has been extradited from Columbia to the USA and awaits trial in Washington DC. In the hopes of forcing the Americans to release him, he institutes a war of terror against Washington DC on several levels. Soon there are assassination attempts on the President and several other key government figures, innocent people are being gunned down left, right and center, bombs are exploding in public places and the city is blacked out when the electrical system is destroyed.<br />How will the politicians, the police, the military and the ordinary residents of Washington react to this? Stephen Coonts has his suggestions, some of which are rather surprising, and this keeps you reading as the level of terror increases and the story unfolds. <br />Stephen Coonts is good at describing people and their relationships. Here's a passage I found especially appealing:<br />\\"You love a woman for many reasons. A goddess she seems when you are young. But finally you see she is of common clay, the same as you, with faults and fears and vain, foolish dreams and petty vices. So you cherish her, love her even more. As she ages you cling closer and closer, holding tighter and tighter. She becomes the female half of you. The toughening of her skin, the engraved lines on her face, the thickening waistline and the sagging breasts, none of it matters a damn. You love her for what she is not as much as for what she is.\\" (Page 87 in the paperback edition I read.)<br />Not what one expects in a thriller, and that makes this quote even more appealing.<br />I do have some criticisms though, and that's why I'm giving Under Siege four stars instead of five. <br />Most importantly, I dislike thrillers that create a fictitious modern history populated with real people. An assassination attempt on the President of the USA is exciting, but placing George Bush Sr. in the role of the target makes the whole thing a bit too weird. <br />Another problem I had with Under Siege is that the description of the mutilation and killing of a drug dealer gets quite a bit too graphic for my taste.<br />Finally, there's a scene where an assassin shoots a man 500 yards away, firing through a glass window right in front of his gun. This is simply not possible as far as I know because the glass window will deflect the trajectory of the bullet by a tiny amount, and after 500 yards this tiny deflection will have become a very large displacement from the desired trajectory.<br />Still, I did like Under Siege a lot, and I think it's a refreshing change from similar high-profile thrillers that are typically populated by cardboard clichés instead of real people.<br />Rennie Petersen	2004-04-08
US	52823951	R10K9HJCX1YIQF	0312981260	559539342	Temple	Books	4	75	78	N	N	Wow! How unrealistic / totally improbable can you get?!	I must admit that reviewing Temple isn't easy for me.    My usual reviewing style is to pan a book for minor inconsistencies in the plot or for unrealistic characters or for a lack of accuracy in information presented as being historically correct. By these standards Temple deserves one star (at most).    But here I am giving Temple four stars despite it being the most blatantly unrealistic and totally improbable book I've ever read!    The operative words here are BLATANTLY unrealistic. And FUN.    Reading a book by Matthew Reilly is like going to a liars convention, where the person who tells the most outlandish, unbelievable, crazy, entertaining story is the winner.    William Race, the hero of Temple, spends approximately 750 pages in constant action, fighting for his life, running for his life, dodging bullets and surviving one disaster after another, always at the very last \\"nanosecond\\" (one of Mr. Reilly's favorite words). William Race does things that are not just improbable but totally impossible. He cheats death every 10th page and spends the next nine pages getting into a situation that has only one possible outcome: certain death!    Several other reviewers have characterized Matthew Reilly's books as \\"comic books in words\\". Exactly! They can also be compared to the old Batman TV shows, where the screen explodes with a \\"POW\\" when one of the characters punches another character.     Here's an example of Matthew Reilly's prose (page 434 in the paperback edition I read):    \\"Race hit him again, and again, and again - yelling with each punch as the Nazi staggered backwards.  'Get -'  Punch.  '- off -'  Punch.  '- my -'  Punch.  '- boat!'\\"    In conclusion, totally unrealistic, totally improbable and 100% entertaining!    At the end of the paperback edition I read there's an 11-page interview with Matthew Reilly that I found quite interesting. Mr. Reilly is very up-front about writing books that attempt to pack as much action as possible between the covers, and he also describes how he became an author:    \\"What led you to self-publish Contest (Matthew Reilly's first book)?\\"    \\"Simple. I offered it to every major publisher in Sydney and they all rejected it!\\"    Sounds like something so improbable that it could be straight out of a Matthew Reilly book. :-)    Rennie Petersen	2004-03-21
US	52823951	REF1DCC2LB6Q6	0380759500	292368144	Firefly	Books	1	223	266	N	N	Too pedophile-friendly for my taste	This book has several problems, the worst one being that I found that the tone was much too sympathetic towards pedophiles.<br /><br />In chapter 32 a leading character tells a story about a five-year-old girl named Nymph who is being sexually mistreated by her father and her brother. This girl, in her confusion, seduces an adult man who she encounters. The seduction is described over 10 pages and becomes pornographically explicit at times. The story is presented in the context that the adult man (whose name is Mad) should not be condemned because he only did what the child asked him to do.<br /><br />In chapter 37 the same character tells a story about an old woman who happens to have a one-way mirror in the wall between a darkened room in her house and a shed built onto the outside of the house. One day two children, a boy and a girl approx. 9-10 years old, wander into the shed and eventually take off their clothes and try playing man and wife, without much success. The old lady is watching through the one-way mirror, and after the children leave she places a tube of lubricant in the shed. When the children come back next day they find this lubricant and use it and their playing is more successful. The old woman, who is watching again, finds this satisfying.<br /><br />At the end of the paperback edition that I read there is an 8-page \\"Author's Note\\". (I believe this note is shorter or missing in some other editions.) In this \\"Author's Note\\" Piers Anthony tries to justify the stories of sexual activities between children and adults and the sympathetic slant towards the adults in the stories. In fact, he shoots himself in the foot:<br /><br />\\"The games five year old Nymph played with Mad where a joy to her at the time, but it was nevertheless abuse by our society's definition (not necessarily that of other societies) ...\\"<br /><br />\\"One of the included stories was written by Santiago Hernandez, in prison for pedophilia.\\"<br /><br />\\"On another occasion she (an innocent five-year-old girl) is left at home with a kindly uncle. He is very attentive and gives her what she likes best: candy. He plays a game with her, but cautions her that it must be secret or they won't be able to play it again. It involves tickling in funny places ... She loves it; no one else treats her like this. She looks eagerly forward to future visits with Uncle, and to the sharing of more secrets.\\"<br /><br />Now it's certainly true that the sexual abuse of children is a problem that exists, and pretending that it doesn't exist won't make it go away. But why make the pedophiles look sympathetic and why try to claim that (some of) the victims are not really victims? I simply can't understand how these pedophile-friendly sections of this book got past the editor.<br /><br />Just out of curiosity, and to check that I wasn't completely off base, I did a Google search for '\\"piers anthony\\" pedophilia'. This resulted in quite a few interesting hits, many of which referred directly to this book.<br /><br />The most shocking web reference I found was a message board where pedophiles hang out and exchange messages concerning their sexual preferences. (I had no idea that such a message board existed.) Here were several messages about how good the books of Piers Anthony are. So despite Piers Anthony's claim that he is not sympathetic towards pedophiles, the pedophiles certainly think that Piers Anthony is sympathetic towards them.<br /><br />Neglecting the pedophile-friendly problem, what about the rest of the book? Well, until I hit chapter 32 I was preparing to give this book only two stars because I found that none of the characters are believable. They all do strange things and are driven by strange motives, and none of them act like normal human beings.<br /><br />There is a lot of allegorical story telling in the book, and at one point I wondered if that explained the strange behavior of the characters. In other words, the entire book was perhaps intended to be an allegorical story instead of story about real people. In that case the allegorical messages, other than the suggestion that pedophiles aren't necessarily bad, went over my head.<br /><br />Not recommended.<br /><br />Rennie Petersene an allegorical story instead of story about real people.

US	52823951	R35KYZE72RABRR	0307277674	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Report from Paris: Dan Brown's "facts" aren't	I really loved \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" when I first read it in January 2004. I devoured 20 pages every evening, and every evening I looked forward to my next fix. Dan Brown has created a really exciting thriller, and what makes it especially appealing is that it is based on a lot of historical information that I found very interesting.<br /><br />Although \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is fiction, Dan Brown writes in a prolog the following: \\"FACT: ... All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\" This added to my liking of the book, convincing me that Dan Brown really was providing a thriller built around a factual framework.<br /><br />In February 2004 I was in Paris, and decided to bring \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" with me and to relive some of the exciting Paris scenes \\"on site\\", so to speak.<br /><br />My first stop was the church of Saint-Sulpice. Sure enough, the \\"rose line\\" described by Dan Brown was there, strange as it sounded from the description in the book. Sitting in the huge old church and listening to the beautiful organ music while rereading the relevant chapters of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was quite an experience!<br /><br />On to the Louvre, with the expectation of an even greater feeling of being right there where the (fictitious) action had occurred. But there I encountered the sad truth: Dan Brown's descriptions of various aspects of the Louvre are simply false.<br /><br />The most blatant and problematic discrepancy concerns \\"La Pyramide Invers&eacute;e\\", which plays an important role in the book. According to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" this inverted pyramid is situated within the Louvre, such that one passes it after entering the main pyramid and going from there to the Denon Wing of the Louvre. Also, the tip of this inverted pyramid is described as being six feet from the floor below it, and the tiny pyramid below the inverted pyramid is described as looking like it protrudes up from down below the floor.<br /><br />Reality is quite different. \\"La Pyramide Invers&eacute;e\\" is actually outside of the Louvre building proper. It is in the middle of an underground shopping mall between the two wings of the Louvre, between a Virgin Megastore (CD's, DVD's, etc.) and an Esprit shop (fashion clothes). Furthermore, it actually comes down to about three feet from the floor, and the tiny pyramid under it looks like it just sits on top of the floor.<br /><br />The other major discrepancy concerns the way Dan Brown describes how Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu meet in a public lavatory in the Louvre. The book says, \\"Here at the westernmost tip of the Denon Wing, the north-south thoroughfare of Place du Carrousel ran almost flush with the building with only a narrow sidewalk separating it from the Louvre's outer wall.\\"<br /><br />Wrong again. There are no public lavatories at the western tip of the Denon Wing. The north-south street that goes around Place du Carrousel does not go past the western tip of the Louvre, it cuts through the Louvre in the middle of the two wings. But there aren't any public lavatories there either so the action that is described as taking place there is not possible.<br /><br />(Incidentally, in the movie based on this book, the first discrepancy is glossed over, and the second one is partially corrected. You can see traffic going through the arch in the building, not past the end of the building. But there's still no public lavatory there in reality.)<br /><br />Nit-picking? Perhaps. But if Dan Brown is cutting corners with \\"facts\\" that he proclaimed to be correct, what about the rest of the historical facts that made the book so interesting? Did he make up or modify these facts too? The assumption that this is probably the case has become unavoidable for me, and this reduces my liking of the book significantly.<br /><br />There are a lot of other details in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" that I found incorrect or very unlikely when I first read the book, but none of them fell into the category of something that Dan Brown had claimed to be authentic. However, the architecture of the Louvre is specified as being correct, and it isn't, and that's where credibility is damaged, and the appeal of the book as being a great thriller based on a framework of reality is also damaged.<br /><br />Rennie Petersenm fell into the category of something that Dan Brown had claimed to be authentic.

US	52823951	R2J6GPM46PRKZB	089141519X	173927110	Never Fight Fair: Navy Seal's Stories of Combat and Adventure	Books	4	8	8	N	N	SEALS displaying their vulnerabilities	This book consists almost exclusively of interviews, printed verbatim, with former (and a few still active) Navy SEALS. As such it is quite different from almost all other books with a similar subject matter.    The interviewed SEALS come across as fairly average guys except that they liked adventure, didn't require a secure home life and were willing to take risks. The degree to which these SEALS displayed being rather average surprised me. In particular I had assumed that members of elite military forces would be fairly intelligent, but the impression I got from reading these interviews was that high intelligence was definitely not a requirement.    In a way the honesty displayed by this book is refreshing. The SEALS aren't made to look like supermen or even heroes. They were men who had elected to do a particular job, received training for that job and then went out and did it. Often they were successful, but often things went wrong, sometimes with fatal results.    One third of the book covers the Vietnam War during which the SEALS were involved in a lot of real combat. But the Vietnam War has two problems relative to a modern book about the SEALS: it happened 30 years ago and the USA lost that war.    The last half of the book covers developments and experiences since the Vietnam War. This includes up-to-date information about the newest diving and parachuting and water-borne landing techniques, all of which I found quite interesting. But this part of the book includes no real combat experiences except for a few pages about Grenada (including a disastrous mission where four SEALS died parachuting from a plane that was flying too low) and the Gulf War (a 4-page story about a group of four SEALS who saw the Iraqi army advancing on them and wisely retreated without firing a shot).    In conclusion, if you're looking for a book about how utterly fantastic the Navy SEALS are then you should steer clear of this one. If you're curious as to what kind of men enjoy jumping out of airplanes at 37000 feet and getting their eyeballs frozen, and prefer honest accounts that include disastrous missions where men died and objectives were not met, then this is a good source.

US	52823951	R3F8ZOS7ELWNK5	0312051077	563853060	The Land God Made in Anger	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Not exactly your average hero	James McQuade, the hero of \\"The Land God Made in Anger\\", is a pretty strange character. On one hand he's a hard-drinking, lecherous guy who becomes totally overwhelmed with greed when he convinces himself (in the absence of any real evidence) that a sunken German submarine from WW II contains a large amount of loot. He's so convinced that he's about to become a millionaire that he even arranges for the disposal of the loot without any knowledge at all of what the loot consists of or how much there is, if any! Then a pretty woman shows up and McQuade goes on a five-day jaunt with her, staying drunk as much as possible and getting laid as often as possible and dreaming about the LOOT whenever he's not getting laid.     Furthermore, McQuade has no scruples about trying to recover and dispose of the loot in secret in order to avoid legal salvage problems, and no compunction about keeping a Nazi war criminal away from Mossad (who wants to send him to trial in Israel) until he (McQuade) has made use of the war criminal in his quest for the loot.    On the other hand, James McQuade is portrayed as being reasonably intelligent and compassionate and concerned about the political future of Namibia and South Africa. He is hard-working and conscientious and perseveres in the face of terrifying conditions. When the woman he has fallen in love with betrays him his anger is mixed with great amounts of sorrow. And unbelievably, when the loot turns out to be something that can be traced back to its original owner, James McQuade decides to return the loot instead of selling it on the black market and becoming rich!    So one problem with this book is that it is hard to identify with the hero, or to believe in someone who has such a mixture of good and bad characteristics. Another problem is that the book is too long, making it less enjoyable to read.    On the plus side the book tells a very exciting and interesting story, with a lot of factual information about the colonization of South Africa, Germany during WW II, the Holocaust, and modern conditions surrounding Namibia and South Africa. (One reviewer has decried the large amount of factual information, but I think that makes a book a lot more interesting.) The characters are very interesting (even if some of them are somewhat unbelievable) and include a large array of people from all walks of life in Southern Africa, plus a few from Europe and the USA.     A thriller is supposed to be exciting, and many of the sequences, especially in the sunken submarine, are indeed written in a very exciting prose. And, as suitable for a book of this kind, the good guy gets the girl in the end and the bad guy dies a horrible and well-deserved death.     I'd have given this book four stars except for the fact that the hero, James McQuade, comes across too much like a juvenile and a loser for a large part of the book. Still, it's a good read, especially if you're interested in Southern Africa or the idea of Nazi war criminals escaping Germany at the end of WW II, taking treasures with them.

US	52823951	R31AO5F4BSZ4UL	031298250X	88732746	America: A Jake Grafton Novel (Jake Grafton Novels)	Books	3	5	6	N	N	The story sinks when the action moves to a cruise ship	This time Stephen Coonts really let me down! I was getting ready to give \\"America\\" five stars until I hit the third-last chapter, at which point the action moves to a luxury cruise ship, and the good guys take their wives along for the jaunt!    When the going gets tough, the tough guys (and their wives) go for a luxury cruise? No way!    Until the last three chapters I really liked \\"America\\". OK, the plot is a bit farfetched, involving hackers meddling with the launch of a super-advanced military satellite and a CIA-trained team of Russians and East Germans stealing a likewise super-advanced US Navy submarine named \\"America\\". But if you can swallow the plot the story is very exciting, and the characterizations of the people in the book is fairly good.     The submarine \\"America\\" and its advanced equipment and weapons are the real stars of the show. I especially loved the descriptions of the havoc created by the Tomahawk cruise missiles with new EMP (electromagnetic pulse) warheads, the attempts by two F-16 Fighting Falcons to shoot down the cruise missiles, and the underwater battle between \\"America\\" and two Los Angeles class submarines. At times like this Stephen Coonts is even better than Tom Clancy.    There is also a whole array of bad guys who you can love to hate. The one who's presented best is the Russian captain Vladimir Kolnikov, the leader of the team that steals \\"America\\" and then inflicts major damage on the USA. Zelda Hudson, the American hacker who finds it only slightly challenging to re-program a satellite launch or to get into any of the Pentagon's weapons systems, is also a cool customer whose services are available to the highest bidder.     Unfortunately, the two top bad guys, the Frenchmen Antoine Jouany and Willi Schlegel, never get much coverage, remaining simply \\"the nasty Europeans\\" who want to challenge the dominance of the USA. It would have been nice if they got to play a larger role.    But then comes the last three chapters, and majordisappointment. Willi Schlegel happens to own a luxury cruise ship and decides to use it to rendezvous with \\"America\\" off the coast of Portugal. This is totally crazy - what bad guy in his right mind would involve hundreds of paying passengers and hundreds of non-combatant crew members in his criminal activities?     Even crazier, the good guys then decide to get aboard the luxury cruise ship pretending to be ordinary passengers and they bring their wives along to provide cover. Of course the bad guys are on top of the situation and the next thing we know the good guys and their wives are being held at gunpoint! Is this dumb or what?    I don't know how you feel about your wife (or husband), but deliberately and unnecessarily putting her (or him) in harm's way when going up against cold-blooded killers is not my idea of proper behavior.    In summary, an exciting techno-thriller that's great until it breaches the reader's credulity when the action in the last three chapters moves to a luxury cruise ship and the good guys bring their wives along for the final confrontation. That twist in the plot is too much to swallow, and spoils the whole book.    Rennie Petersen	2003-08-25
US	52823951	R9YRG370SKE57	0312978375	204354638	Hong Kong (A Jake Grafton Novel)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	You've kidnapped my wife? How naughty of you!	I found this book rather disappointing, even though it did get quite exciting towards the end with the descriptions of how the rebel forces take on the Chinese Army and manage to take over Hong Kong.    My biggest criticism has to do with the way Jake Grafton responds to the kidnapping of his wife Callie by Hong Kong crime boss Sonny Wong. Jake knows that Sonny has Callie locked up somewhere, is having her tortured, and probably intends to kill her when he gets the information he wants and/or gets the ransom he is demanding.     So what does Jake do? He stages a raid on Sonny's restaurant, shooting a guard dead in the process. Jake then confronts Sonny and finishes up by setting fire to Sonny's restaurant. But does he demand his wife released here and now? No! Jake makes various threats to Sonny about what he'll do if Callie is harmed and then walks away!    I found that action so crazy that I spent most of the rest of the book wondering how Jake could be so dumb as to act like that. As a small redeeming feature even Jake wonders how he was so dumb: 100 pages later he's thinking of himself in the third person and saying, \\"He had his chance last night. He should have stuck his revolver up Wong's nose and told him he was going to blow his f***ing head off if he didn't produce Callie in a quarter of an hour.\\"    Of course Jake eventually learns where Callie is being held captive and stages another raid in which he manages to free her. But still, how could he have been so dumb (and so uncaring?) to not exploit his first chance to get Callie freed?    I also found it somewhat problematic that the \\"Sergeant York\\" fighting robots were so advanced. This book is supposed to be a techno-thriller, but these robots were so intelligent and so powerful that it was more like science fiction.     So far I've read two of Stephen Coonts' books and I do intend to read some more despite my disappointment with this one. But one thought keeps returning to me: how does someone with Jake Grafton's flair for disobeying orders get promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral?    Rennie Petersen	2003-08-12
US	52823951	R19OD1B4OOORAI	075409085X	41285697	The Frontrunner (Paragon Softcover Large Print Books)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Starts good, but then fizzles	The title of this book, \\"The Frontrunner\\", refers to an illegal practice that stock dealers can engage in: buying some stocks personally just before placing a large buy order for a client. I found this piece of information, and many other descriptions of things such as hedge funds and derivatives, to be fascinating. It's clear that the author really knows a lot about the global stock markets and this is a major plus for the book.    The characterizations of the two main persons are also good. You don't expect the hero in a thriller to be a single father who spends a lot of time worrying about his children, nor do you expect the heroine to be a woman who was abused by her father. I like it when the characters in books are described as real people instead of being shallow clichs.    But now, unfortunately, I'm running out of positive things to say about this book.     The story starts out good but there are two serious problems. First, there is no really nasty bad guy that you can hiss and boo. The world's stock markets go into a tailspin but it's more or less just by chance, not because of the manipulations of some sinister and greedy villain. So the hero and heroine have to save the world, but without the benefit of a nasty opponent.    The second problem with the story is that towards the end of the book the author creates a situation that is obviously very contrived. The hero and heroine are trapped on the island of Bermuda and are being threatened by a couple of nasty and unscrupulous characters, but the way in which they get trapped and the extent of the threats (just enough to provide some tension but not enough to really create a panic) is so artificial that I practically lost all interest in the story.    Another problem is that I found it unrealistic that so many of the characters in the book were corrupt and unsavory. The Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is cheating on his wife and so stupid that he thinks you can trust blackmailers. The Governorof the Bank of England is corrupt enough to try to make a personal killing out of the international stock market rescue effort. The Governor of the Bank of Japan is engaged in expenses fraud, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority faked his college diploma, and the President of the European Central Bank is passing insider information to a lover. Maybe I'm naive, but I don't think this large a percentage of top businessmen are unethical.    Then there's a technical quibble that I have regarding the way in which the hero creates an Internet web page to unmask the bad guys. It's possible, although very unlikely, that our hero could learn how to use Microsoft FrontPage by just reading the manual, and learn how to use a scanner and an FTP program through trial and error. But then we're told that this web page, which contains dozens of scanned pictures, got one million \\"hits\\" during one day! That would give a bandwidth usage of several gigabytes, which is enough to bring any ordinary web server to its knees!    Finally, I found the author's writing style, with very short sentences and clever quips, to be somewhat irritating.     In summary, very good information about the global stock markets, good characterizations and a fairly good story until it becomes too contrived. But by the time you reach the end of the book you feel that the problems outweigh the good points.    Rennie Petersen	2003-07-26
US	52823951	R3CLEW6S0RHFT7	044020447X	939043812	Final Flight	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Good techno-thriller with real people	\\"Final Flight\\" really appealed to me as a techno-thriller where at least most of the people came across as real people, not shallow clichs.    Most of the story takes place on the aircraft carrier USS United States, and I found the descriptions of how a modern aircraft carrier functions fascinating. A ship like this and the aircraft on board it are an incredibly complicated yet awesomely powerful fighting machine.     Stephen Coonts describes in detail many of the procedures involved in launching and recovering the airplanes on an aircraft carrier. The level of complication is such that I found myself surprised that these things function at all, let alone function reliably.    The assault on the aircraft carrier by a group of ruthless terrorists, and its defense by the seamen and marines made great reading. I also loved the description of the dog fight between the lone F-14 Tomcat and four MiG-23 Floggers. This was a real edge-of-the-seat climax to the story.    As mentioned above, I found it appealing that most of the characters in the story actually come across as real people, with real people's problems and worries and motivations and good sides and bad sides. Also, the U.S. Navy is depicted as an organization with certain deficiencies, such as excessive bureaucracy, suppression of private initiative and lack of rewards for individual thought.    This is in contrast with most techno-thrillers, where all the characters are stereotyped and shallow \\"good guys\\" or \\"bad guys\\", and the western military organizations are the epitome of efficiency and functionality.    Despite what I've just said about the characters, I did find the top bad guy somewhat unrealistic, and this is the reason for the lack of the fifth star. Am I really supposed to believe in someone who,  - makes love to a female assistant in the locked trunk of a limousine?  - talks to a Russian General via a radio transmitter in a belt buckle?  - spends 1/2 hour burning a top secret manual for a nuclear bomb a few pages at a time in a furnace in the basement of a hotel?    But despite my problem with the top bad guy I really liked this book, and am looking forward to reading more of Stephen Coonts' books.    Rennie Petersen	2003-07-15

The book is unfortunately out of print but I was eventually able to find a used copy.    In \\"Cruises with Kathleen\\" Donald Hamilton describes various cruises that he has taken with his 27-foot sail boat Kathleen during the years 1976 to 1979. This includes:     - a shake-down cruise for the brand new boat from Vancouver, B.C. (where Kathleen was built) to Seattle, Washington and back to Vancouver.     - a 1000-mile offshore cruise from Vancouver to Los Angeles, during which he was hit by three violent storms.     - sailing Kathleen from Houston, Texas (to where Kathleen had been moved by truck) to the Florida Keys via the Intracoastal Waterway and off the shore of Florida.     - a cruise to Miami and back, with and against the Gulf Stream.     - a cruise to Cuba together with a group of other boats, the first permitted for American yachtsmen in several decades.     - a cruise to the Bahamas, two weeks of island-hopping, and back to Florida.     A few of these cruises were done by Donald Hamilton alone, but most of them were done together with either his son Gordon or his wife Kay. There are a fair number of photographs illustrating the book, including several pictures of Donald Hamilton himself and one of his son Gordon.     Some of the material in this book had previously been published as articles in various boating magazines, and it shows, in that there is a lack of smooth flow from chapter to chapter.      At the time covered by the book Donald Hamilton was in his early sixties, and had not done any wind-powered sailing since his youth. However, he had become disenchanted with power boats (his previous boat had sported twin 115 hp. outboard motors!) and felt the urge to return to real sailing.      It is this situation, and the fact that Donald Hamilton is a very individualistic and opinionated person, that makesthe book interesting. He describes why he wanted Kathleen to have certain attributes and how he went about finding a designer and ship yard with the proper basic boat design and willing to cater to his desires. He also writes eloquently about various other, sometimes controversial, positions on various topics.     I found one particular quote to be very interesting, on the subject of whether or not it was a good idea to visit Cuba considering the then-current American policy towards that country: \\"I won't argue the point beyond stating, speaking only for myself, that I've visited a number of foreign countries, and even some U.S. states and cities, whose politics turned my stomach, without ever feeling that I was showing approval of the governments involved.\\"     This book is written by a sailor and the intended audience is other sailors. As a non-sailor I found myself both mystified and bored by a lot of the long descriptions of various kinds of equipment and sailing techniques.     So as a non-sailor I'm not really qualified to review this book, other than to say that I found it interesting and well written. But I felt that it gave some insights into the personality of Matt Helm's \\"father\\", and as such I'd recommend it to other hard-core Matt Helm fans who would like to know more about Donald Hamilton.

US	52823951	R185UP0E8J91VY	0345420438	352579083	The Tailor of Panama	Books	5	36	38	N	N	An incredible, funny, touching tragedy	I read this book for the first time two months ago, and now I've read it again. My second reading was inspired by the fact that I was part way through the book the first time before I realized what an incredible book it was. So I wanted to read it again from the start with a proper sense of appreciation.    \\"The Tailor of Panama\\" is purportedly a spy thriller, but the spy story is actually just the framework on which John le Carré weaves his amazing study of human nature. And the human characteristics which are dominant are not ones that the human race should be proud of. We are presented with large amounts of greed, dishonesty, jealousy, cruelty, selfish lust, corruption, apathy, frailty and stupidity. On top of that we are presented with some of the less attractive conditions for human existence: poverty, suffering, guilt and sickness.    But the amazing thing is that John le Carré writes about these human characteristics and conditions with a great deal of humor and understanding. And he does provide a few glimpses of love, altruism and generosity.    So even though the story ends tragically it is for the most part a funny and touching story, and this makes the book very readable.    Another strength of the book is John le Carré's masterful command of the English language. He writes beautiful descriptions, and has a surprising and inventive way with words. I often found myself delighted with one sentence after another, each one saying something in a way I hadn't realized was possible.    The way in which the plot is slowly but surely expanded is also very satisfying. We start out with the daily lives of a few seemingly ordinary people. But then the seemingly ordinary people are shown to be less and less ordinary, and at the same time more and more people are added to the story, and the scope of the story expands until high-level international politics of the worst sort get involved.    Yet another positive aspect of the book is the large amount of very interesting information about life in Panama and how Panama society works. In this respect the book can be considered to be an insider's tourist guide to Panama.    Highly recommended - and to be read slowly and savored.    Finally, my opinion as to why there have been a lot of reviewers who have given this book a low rating: I'm guessing that many of these reviewers expected a straight James-Bond-style spy thriller and were disappointed because \\"The Tailor of Panama\\" is definitely not a simple spy thriller. Another \\"problem\\" may be that most of the main characters are very British, and the book is written in British English. The dialog between the characters contains a lot of British slang and British expressions. To me this adds to the charm of the book, but I'm guessing that some readers find this irritating.

US	52823951	R1P2EJYP86RS8H	0061098019	951535361	H.M.S. Unseen	Books	3	4	4	N	N	How to make an exciting story seem dull	First the good points:   - an exciting story involving high intrigue and the world's most wanted terrorist   - confrontation between the USA and England on one side and Iraq and Iran on the other side - how topical can you get?  - a techno-thriller about an undetectable submarine and lots of other modern military hardware    With all that going for it, H.M.S. Unseen should have been a great read. But what did we get? A book that makes the exciting moments (stealing the submarine, the shooting down of the Concorde, etc.) sound dull, and makes the in-between parts positively sleep-inducing.    On top of that, the ending is really poor. (Spoiler alert - don't read any more if you want to avoid learning how the book ends.)    The President of the United States decrees that the government of Iraq (i.e., Saddam Hussein) is to be punished. The President's national security advisor implements an attack which results in a major portion of Iraq becoming flooded. The national security advisor proudly reports to the President that Iraq's economy has been dealt a major blow from which it will take them 10 years to recover.     So it's apparently considered legitimate to cause major suffering to the entire population of a country just to \\"punish\\" the dictator at the top. In reality, Saddam is presumably totally unconcerned with his people's suffering and will probably find himself in a strengthened position, since he and his people now have proof that they have a common enemy with no moral scruples.    Of course, reality has now bypassed this portion of the book. So although the story is supposedly set in the near future, it must now be considered a total fiction which isn't even remotely possible.    Rennie Petersen	2003-05-17
US	52823951	RBO0PYCQ9GAEU	0515134864	436056065	Turbulence	Books	3	4	8	N	N	Too many inconsistencies in the plot	The problem with this book is that the author isn't trying to tell a story. Instead, he has a MESSAGE that he wants to get across to the reader: American airlines aren't treating their passengers the way they should, and this is going to backfire on them sooner or later.    In order to push this message the author had to concoct a story that would bear out the message. And this he did, but the story is too unrealistic to be believed, and it even contains several inconsistencies that highlight how unbelievable and poorly constructed the plot is.    Inconsistency no. 1: The plane lands in Katsina in Nigeria in the middle of a battle between rebels led by Jean Onitsa and the Nigerian government troops. Onitsa stages a mock hostage taking of the passengers and demands ransom money from the USA and the Nigerian government. But this mock hostage taking will only work if the pilot of the airplane either backs up Onitsa's claims or at least does not dispute Onitsa's claims that he has taken the passengers as hostages. Onitsa had no way of expecting this to be the case, so the whole idea of the mock hostage taking is crazy. (In fact the airplane happens to have a radio failure so the pilot is unable to dispute Onitsa's claims and Onitsa succeeds in getting a $10 million ransom from the Nigerian government! But Onitsa had no way of knowing there would be a radio failure, so Onitsa's \\"clever\\" stunt makes no sense.)    Inconsistency no. 2: James Haverston, an airline employee at Heathrow airport, is worried about one of the passengers, Brian Logan, and checks him out on the airline's computer database. The next day he gets a frantic call from Washington. Does Haverston recall anything special about a passenger named Logan? If there was a problem with passenger Logan it is VERY important that Haverston confirms it. But by then Haverston has forgotten the name of the passenger he was worried about the day before, and therefore refuses to confirm that he had a run-in with a passenger named Logan, even though he would otherwise like to help the man in Washington. In reality all Haverston needs to do is to check the flight's passenger list to get Logan's first name and then to check the database again, at which point he would recognize Brian Logan's history and could confirm his encounter with Brian Logan.    A more general inconsistency or unbelievable twist in the plot has to do with the relationship between Brian Logan and the pilot. Logan, with much justification, becomes more and more antagonistic towards the pilot, and inspires an uprising among the passengers against the pilot. At one point they even try to break into the cockpit by force. The pilot is equally antagonistic towards Logan and the passengers. But then suddenly and without much justification they settle their differences and start cooperating! One gets the feeling that the author felt that he had gone too far and wanted to steer towards a Hollywood happy ending, and that's what he wrote, with Logan and the pilot becoming friends at the end! But considering the pent-up situation and the degree of enmity between Logan and the pilot their sudden reconciliation rings very false.    I've just talked about some of the negative aspects of the book so far. To conclude this review I'll just say that if you can ignore these problems with the plot and the author's promoting of his message then the book is fairly good and keeps you reading. So it's definitely not a total failure.    Rennie Petersen	2003-04-07
US	52823951	R3ASK0WWEHN79B	0425170349	626650351	Rainbow Six (John Clark Novel, A)	Books	2	9	20	N	N	Loving, caring, intelligent cold-blooded killers	I've read quite a few of Tom Clancy's books and liked most of them. But this one really bothered me.    The book is about an anti-terrorist group called Rainbow, and describes their training and abilities. We follow them on several of their missions where they demonstrate their talent at putting three bullets into the head of each terrorist in the wink of an eye. You see Rainbow is based on military principles, not police concepts or laws against murder, so there are no silly rules about \\"hands up, drop your weapon!\\" Just get close enough to shoot and then shoot to kill.    All well and good, and I'm sure that if I was ever taken hostage by terrorists that I'd welcome the arrival of a group of highly-skilled cold-blooded killers who would take care of my problem.    The thing that bothers me is that Tom Clancy wants us to believe that these same guys who make their living killing other human beings are loving, caring husbands and fathers, and they experience no conflict between their occupation and their family life. This is apparently very important to Clancy because he goes on and on about what wonderful family fathers all of these guys are. They're all married and all have children and all of them have the wife and kids stationed on the outskirts of the army camp where Rainbow is based.     Clancy describes, for example, how the members of Rainbow feel no regret when they come home from a hard day of slaughter. When wifey, watching the TV coverage, asks, \\"did you actually kill any of them?\\" they brush it off with, \\"you don't really want to know, and anyway, I'm on the side of the angels, remember?\\"    I don't think this is very realistic, to put it mildly. Most of what I've read about Special Forces personnel, and especially the ones who have actually been in combat and killed in the line of duty, is that they make lousy husbands and fathers. Which is OK - a civilized society needs some uncivilized nasties to keep the other nasties at bay. I just don't see why Clancy feels the need to claim that you shouldn't mind having your daughter marry one of these killers.    Clancy also wants us to believe that these guys are intellectuals. For example, Ding, the leader of one of the two Rainbow teams, has a Masters degree, and his wife is a medical doctor! And what sort of daily problems does Ding have which needs great intelligence and a Masters degree? Well, he does spend some time thinking over whether he should do more target practicing with his automatic rifle or his handgun. The art of killing terrorists is obviously something that not just any old idiot can do right!    Another aspect of the book's lack of realism has to do with the fact that being a terrorist killer is not without its risks. At one point two of the Rainbow team members get killed, and we're presumably supposed to believe that their wives and children take the loss of their loving, caring, intellectual husbands and fathers in stride. They died serving a greater cause so their loss is to be accepted. Uh-huh? And why were these loving, caring, intelligent men so dumb that they got into a line of work where there was a high chance of them turning their loving, caring, intellectual wives into widows and leaving their children fatherless?    I realize that I've focused on just one particular aspect of this book, but it's an aspect that Clancy apparently considered very important, and which I found very unrealistic and thus very irritating.    To make things worse, Clancy managed to irritate me in another way in this book. The bad guys in the book are a bunch of environmentalists who have gone off the deep end in their desire to get back to Nature. That's OK, but what I didn't like is that Clancy obviously has no use for environmentalists in general. The good guys consistently refer to all environmentalists as \\"tree-huggers\\" and imply that anybody who worries about the ozone layer or the future of our planet is stupid. A very dangerous and shortsighted attitude.No more Tom Clancy for me for a while.    Rennie Petersen	2003-03-29

The idea of a techno-thriller involving lots of hard science mixed with political skullduggery really appealed to me. The plot is quite twisted and moves along at a brisk pace, keeping you wondering what in the world is going to happen next.<br /><br />My biggest criticism is that it's hard to take the characters seriously when the author doesn't take them seriously. Almost all of the characters kid around and talk/act like unruly teenagers. At one point the President of the United States steals the main protagonist's mobile telephone! Very funny, but are we supposed to think this is realistic behavior from real adult characters?<br /><br />Despite this problem with the characters I'm looking forward to reading more of Dan Brown's books.<br /><br />Rennie Petersen	2003-03-19
US	52823951	R1B3W0035OZ7Q4	0671532669	715584572	Never Fight Fair!: Inside the Legendary U.S. Navy Seals	Books	4	16	16	N	N	SEALS displaying their vulnerabilities	This book consists almost exclusively of interviews, printed verbatim, with former (and a few still active) Navy SEALS. As such it is quite different from almost all other books with a similar subject matter.    The interviewed SEALS come across as fairly average guys except that they liked adventure, didn't require a secure home life and were willing to take risks. The degree to which these SEALS displayed being rather average surprised me. In particular I had assumed that members of elite military forces would be fairly intelligent, but the impression I got from reading these interviews was that high intelligence was definitely not a requirement.    In a way the honesty displayed by this book is refreshing. The SEALS aren't made to look like supermen or even heroes. They were men who had elected to do a particular job, received training for that job and then went out and did it. Often they were successful, but often things went wrong, sometimes with fatal results.    One third of the book covers the Vietnam War during which the SEALS were involved in a lot of real combat. But the Vietnam War has two problems relative to a modern book about the SEALS: it happened 30 years ago and the USA lost that war.    The last half of the book covers developments and experiences since the Vietnam War. This includes up-to-date information about the newest diving and parachuting and water-borne landing techniques, all of which I found quite interesting. But this part of the book includes no real combat experiences except for a few pages about Grenada (including a disastrous mission where four SEALS died parachuting from a plane that was flying too low) and the Gulf War in 1991 (a 4-page story about a group of four SEALS who saw the Iraqi army advancing on them and wisely retreated without firing a shot).    In conclusion, if you're looking for a book about how utterly fantastic the Navy SEALS are then you should steer clear of this one. If you're curious as to what kind of men enjoy jumping out of airplanes at 37000 feet and getting their eyeballs frozen, and prefer honest accounts that include disastrous missions where men died and objectives were not met, then this is a good source.

To really like this book you need to be a bit of a military fanatic. Fred Franks repeats so many times how wonderful it is to be a soldier, and how great the \\"warrior ethos\\" is, that you realize that for him the military is practically a religion.    The thing in this book that I found the most interesting are the descriptions of the magnitude of military might that was fielded during Desert Storm.     The American Army VII Corps (commanded by Gen. Franks) included 146,000 soldiers, 50,000 vehicles (incl. 1,600 tanks) and 800 helicopters. Not only are these numbers huge, but the logistics involved are mind-boggling: the soldiers need food and water, and the vehicles and aircraft burned an incredible 3.2 million gallons of fuel each day. When fighting the VII Corps expended 2,500 tons of ammunition every day.    And VII Corps was only part of the military forces involved. There was another Army corps, there were Marine units, there was the Air Force and the Navy, and forces from quite a few other countries. An amazing marshalling of military forces, and all under the command of General Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf (more about him later).    I found the book interesting, but it does have a lot of problems. It's way too long, mostly due to repetitiveness. With some editing it could have been cut down by at least 30% with no loss of information.    Another problem is that there are no useful maps. There are a lot of small maps, about 1/3 of a page each, but they simply don't show enough detail. Again and again you find the text referring to some town or road or river and they simply aren't on the maps.    Another major problem is the lack of a glossary with definitions for all the military acronyms and abbreviations that are used.    And then we have General Schwarzkopf, who is NOT thanked in the acknowledgements. Gen. Franks is very careful to thank everyone from his parents to his family to all of his subordinates, and then goes on to thank Colin Powell (then Chairman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff), Dick Cheney (then Sec. of Defense) and President George Bush Sr. But not Gen. Schwarzkopf.    It turns out that Gen. Schwarzkopf wrote an autobiography, \\"It Doesn't Take a Hero\\", and in that book he criticized Gen. Franks for the way he commanded VII Corps during Desert Storm.    Gen. Franks uses this book to return the favor. I won't go into extensive details (and Gen. Franks keeps his criticism fairly low-key), but Franks basically claims that Schwarzkopf liked having his butt kissed by his subordinates, was prone to throwing temper tantrums, wasn't competent to understand or command armored (tank) operations and made several tactical errors. In particular, not giving VII Corps more operational room to the north, not using the Air Force to prevent the Iraqi Republican Guards from escaping northwards and declaring \\"victory\\" a couple of days prematurely were big mistakes. The result was that Washington decreed a ceasefire and a large portion of the Republican Guards avoided destruction.    I actually found this dispute between Franks and Schwarzkopf to be quite interesting, and it's so very human to want to get back at someone who's done you dirt. So whether Franks or Schwarzkopf is right, the dispute does add flavor to Franks' story.     Rennie Petersen	2002-08-30

The supposed hero, Andrew Falcon, comes across as totally self-centered and selfish and amoral, just the kind of person anyone in their right mind would avoid having as a friend or lover. I'd prefer to read a book where I can identify with the hero.    Another problem is that the book is unrealistic in its description of how top businessmen interact. There are descriptions of meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank, where the Chairman acts like a petty dictator and treats the other committee members like school children. These supposedly high-level, experienced and intelligent bankers accept the chairman's treatment submissively! This is totally crazy. Nobody gets to rise to the top of the business world with the kind of personality problems being described here.    Finally there's a major plot problem at the end of the book. The \\"hero\\" and the bad guys both have incriminating evidence on each other, so the hero is prevented from sending the bad guys to prison. But then, after we're told that the bad guys have succeeded in toppling the President of the United States and bumping off one of the hero's girlfriends, then the hero does go to the authorities and gets the bad guys sent up. There's no explanation of why he couldn't have done that six months earlier and thus saved the President and his girlfriend. (Fortunately, he has a \\"reserve girlfriend\\" that he can spend his declining years with, so the loss of one girlfriend is no major problem.)    There are some positive things in the book, for example the interesting information about how investment banking and especially a leveraged buyout work. It's also interesting to read about how the stock exchange, and Wall Street in general, functions. But this doesn't make up for the problems I've described above.    Rennie Petersen	2002-08-19

You think again and again about what your own response would be to the kind of temptation that the characters in this book are presented with, and you probably find yourself worrying more than a little.    My big problem with this book is that the bad guy, Leland Gaunt, is not believable. What exactly are his motives? In the first part of the book we are led to believe that he is just a mischief-maker, and this I could accept. But then it turns out that his powers are incredible and that his motives are much more malign, and this is where I can't accept things.    Let's face it, this guy is so powerful that he could start WW III without even working up a sweat. So what's he doing setting up shop in a small New England town and messing with the heads of the local yokels? It doesn't make sense, and this spoils what would otherwise have been a really great book.    Rennie Petersen	2001-12-02

For those not familiar with his books, Tom Clancy writes \\"techno-thrillers\\", books where a lot of high-tech stuff, mostly military hardware, has a central role.    \\"ruthless.com\\" is billed as involving computer technology and high drama in the IT business so I was looking forward to enjoying it. Unfortunately, I found it poorly written and totally unrealistic. Furthermore, the leading character comes across as a bit of an idiot and the leading bad guy is very unfairly based on Bill Gates. In other words, I didn't like the book at all.    The basic story is about the hero, Roger Gordian and his company, UpLink International, being targeted for a hostile takeover by the nasty Marcus Cain, who runs Monolith Technologies. But big business conflicts aren't exciting enough for a Tom Clancy book (even though Marcus Cain is into all sorts of dirty tricks including murder attempts) so there's a sinister over-plot involving some really nasty Asians who are using Marcus Cain as a pawn in their bid for total world domination.    And how do Microsoft-like companies find themselves involved in an international military power struggle? It has something to do with encryption technology... For example, the bad guys break into a privately-run high-security \\"crypto key repository facility\\" to steal the encryption keys for a US Navy nuclear submarine's communications links! This is ludicrous, both because modern encryption systems do not use \\"back-up keys\\" stored in any kind of \\"repository\\" and because the US military would never place such keys, if they did exist, in a privately-run repository.    In addition to finding the plot totally unbelievable I also didn't like the two main characters. Roger Gordian is supposed to be the hero but how are you supposed to identify with someone who's so dumb that he thinks that he can keep encryption technology out ofthe hands of terrorists by refusing to export it from the good ol' USA? The fact that some of the best encryption technology comes from Israel and is based on work done by Russian scientists isn't mentioned in the book. Then there's the plot-line about a hostile takeover attempt to which Gordian has stupidly made his company vulnerable, and his supposedly very clever way of getting out if this problem which basically involves him stopping being quite as stupid as he has previously been.    I also found it distasteful that the badies Marcus Cain and his Monolith Technologies are obviously based on Bill Gates and Microsoft. Marcus Cain went to Harvard but dropped out (was expelled), built up a company based on operating systems for computers, stole most of the ideas that his company's software is based on, is into philanthropy (but only as a PR trick), and is willing to do just about anything to crush a competitor. Anyone who knows the Bill Gates and Microsoft story can see the large number of similarities, but with everything distorted and exaggerated.    All-in-all a total waste of time. It should have been called \\"mindless.com\\".    Rennie Petersen	2001-01-27
