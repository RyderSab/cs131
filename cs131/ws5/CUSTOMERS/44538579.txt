To have two teenagers getting so excited about going to the opera that they'll wait in long lines, stand for the performance, and still go after a fatiguing day, may be hard for modern readers to imagine.  This book takes you back to that time, to a childhood in Europe before TV and radio.<br /><br />This book is absolutely fascinating.  It's in the \\"read and re-read and re-read\\" category, and still controversial even today!<br /><br />At the end of WWII in 1945, Kubizek must have been one of the very few people still alive who had known both the teenage Adolf Hitler AND Hitler's mother before she died.  Kubizek writes about the funeral setting and arrangements, Hitler's reaction.<br /><br />Though controversial, the dialog and reactions for the most part will \\"ring true\\" for students of Hitler and the NSDAP from other first-hand source material.<br /><br />Kubizek tells of almost unbelievable living conditions in a packed, shared room with Hitler and a piano!  He writes that he and Adolf once attempted to write an opera together, and that Hitler did play the piano (badly) and had had music lessons.  He writes of time before Hitler became a vegetarian.  He writes of several very early, pre-WWI, incidents involving Jews.<br /><br />Kubizek credits Hitler, directly, for encouraging him to pursue his musical career.<br /><br />After Hitler becomes Chancellor of Germany, Kubizek's accounts of further meetings with him, years after being teenage roomates, makes absolutely gripping reading.  One amusing sidelight is the clever way Kubizek managed to turn away pressure from various NSDAP officials during the Third Reich period.<br /><br />Kubizek's is an eyewitness account like no other known.  Once you start reading this book, you want more, more, more!  (It's really a loss that many more English-speaking historians, researchers, and camera men didn't get to Kubizek before his death!)<br /><br />To Kubizek's credit, the reader has to consider that, when he wrote these reminiscences, after WWII, he had nothing to gain whatsoever in giving a sympathetic portrayal of Hitler, yet he does anyway.wrote these reminiscences, after WWII, he had nothing to gain whatsoever in giving a sympathetic portrayal of Hitler, yet he does anyway.	2005-04-12

I won't give it away here.) <br /> <br />This book is a great resource and insightful time capsule, even though it was first put together in the 1991-1992 timeframe.  For the business (or political) minded, this material will cause you to consider a lot of things in American economic history of recent decades. <br /> <br />Hundreds of products and companies are listed, in all categories, as either AMERICAN OWNED or FOREIGN OWNED.  Quite a few will surprise or shock the average reader, who never made that link before for the common products on the store shelves. <br /> <br />It is acknowledged in the book that company ownerships can change every day, but this snapshot in time is still fascinating.  This was just prior to the great flood of China-made imports, so it is interesting to see all the product names where Japan had those markets at that time.  There are many, many more listed common products from England, France, and Netherlands (ownership) than most Americans would guess. <br /> <br />The very brief comments between sections is extremely educational on this subject:  \\"Nine major studios control most of America's movie and TV production, but only four are American-owned.  Of the top ten companies that dominate America's music business, only three are American.\\"  \\"The VCR was invented by an American, yet none are manuafactured in America.\\"  \\"Since the trade assault on the domestic television industry began more than two decades ago, all but one U.S.-owned TV maker was either driven out of business or acquired by foreigners.\\"  \\"In 1955, America manufactured 96% of all radios sold, but by the late 80s, almost none.\\"  \\"Nearly half of the high-tech weaponry used in Desert Storm in Iraq was not made in the United States.\\" <br /> <br />The short section on former U.S. government officers going to work as lobbyists for foreign corporations and governments is a real eye-opener!  The mention and reference to the book _Agents of Influence_ is one of the most valuable nuggets I found in this book. <br /> <br />Thought-provoking and highly recommended!	2005-02-10

After reading this book, you may feel an overpowering urge to buy some gold the same night! <br /> <br />The author forcefully makes the case that in the near-certain massive economic \\"meltdown\\" he predicts, gold may be about the only thing that can save you. <br /> <br />Most [U.S.] readers will already be familiar with the facts about the national debt, consumer credit, and the declining dollar, but here it is all put together with such breadth, clarity, and historic tie-ins as to leave you speechless.  In a word, the scenarios -- that are hard to find any argument against -- are \\"scary\\"! <br /> <br />The story of gold itself is also fascinating.  I had never realized the extent of the sudden U.S. law changes under FDR (who closed the banks) and the national confiscation -- complete with prison sentences! -- that was carried out.  Here you'll learn the reasons behind it all and what it accomplished. <br /> <br />The author was (is?) in the gold coin business, so there is naturally that marketing slant in certain parts of the book, but it does not detract from the big picture of the lessons here. <br /> <br />This book is at the top end of books that are thought-provoking, informative, and useful in a practical way in your life. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2005-01-22

Field Marshal Milch's eyewitness account of major events and personalities, including A.H., is priceless and unequalled.  Author and honest, non-PC history-researcher David Irving has created another masterpiece of an absorbing read.    Field Marshal Milch supplies great material on the background of the V-1, V-2, and jets.  The late-war production increases of aircraft arranged by Milch's own efforts, under the extreme war circumstances, are phenomenal to read about!  The constant struggle for labor from various sources is excellent historical material seldom found laid out this way in other sources.    \\"He suddenly tore the field marshal's baton from his hands and began raining blows on the back of Milch's skull\\" ... is how the section on his capture by the Allies begins.	2005-01-13

To have your gun crew assistant shot in the head by a Soviet sniper -- TWICE in the same foxhole!! -- must make a strong impression on any reader who has ever served in uniform! <br /> <br />\\"Landser\\" and heavy machine-gunner Koschorrek had his diary captured by the Soviets, but was able to \\"smuggle\\" notes -- against orders at the time -- in his jacket lining to his relatives when on home leave. In a true-life amazing story, Koschorrek then received the notes back from his daughter in America almost forty years after the war! <br /> <br />While the frontline soldier's eyeview is riveting, it is overly limited as a WWII memoir, and this book could easily be turned into a great one by a talented editor.  (I do hope Herr Koschorrek continues to expand the work in a second edition. The book definitely needs an \\"Epilogue\\" giving what must be the fascinating details of the author's survival in post-war Germany.) <br /> <br />In such excellent related books as __SOLDAT__ and __IN DEADLY COMBAT__, the reader gets the author's view, reaction, and details of some of the great personalities and major news of the day.  Such things as the D-Day invasion are not mentioned in __BLOOD RED SNOW__, and it would be fascinating to read exactly what news these soldiers received on the eastern front and what their reaction to it was.  Did they hear any of the propaganda broadcasts from captive German officers after Stalingrad?  Did the stuka pilots overhead include Rudel or had he heard the name, in the trenches?  Did anybody talk about North Africa or Rommel?  What happened to the \\"Russian volunteers\\" in his unit?  I could ask the author a million questions, and some talented editor should have and then rounded out this book with more \\"bigger picture\\" perceptions from the author's war-time experiences and memories.  While it is a measure of a fantastic memory to relate that the coffee had been reheated, and was \\"thin and flat\\" in the hospital at the end of the war, surely the author also had impressions of other major events in Germany in those last few fateful years. <br /> <br />Mechanically, this Greenhill/Stackpole edition is below today's proofreading standards, which is surprising.  It's littered with typographical errors such as the one on page 270:  \\"through my sigh [sic], I spot...\\"  The book needs an American English edition.  While the translation seems to be of above-average quality, the British English spelling and idiom -- \\"that bloke over there\\" -- will be a distraction for many readers.	2004-12-01

I did not find these mentions distractive. <br /> <br />The reference list of associations in Chapter 5 is useful and handily organized.  The list of products/services in the back does contain some business ideas that I had not considered before. <br /> <br />The banking and loan information tips are particularly valuable and presented in easy-to-understand terms. The author's advice is excellent, and the average person probably does not know how to approach the applications in the way he explains.	2004-10-11

This little treasure is one of the all-time classics to come out of WWII, but few people have heard about it (which makes it a great gift idea, too, for friends who are into WWII history and military subjects). <br /> <br />This is a first-hand account of the part Richard Hillary and his friends played as fighter pilots in the Battle of Britain.  This is gripping reading from beginning to end! <br /> <br />From Mr. Hillary:  \\"Disillusioned and spoiled, referred to as The Lost Generation, we were without any Holy Grail until the war provided it in what seemed a delightfully palatable form. For myself, I was glad for purely selfish reasons. As a fighter pilot I hoped for a concentration of amusement, fear, and exaltation which I had little chance of experiencing in another form of existence. I was not disappointed.\\" <br /> <br />The traditional British understatement makes this book, and this dramatic personal story, all the more enjoyable to read. <br /> <br />Now that you've found it, please tell your friends about it!	2004-09-22

There is not much good training material available for chaplains/pastors/counselors on this subject and situation, so this book is an invaluable addition to that private library.<br />This author does deal with the Christian way of living with any such medical affliction, though that religious perspective does not dominate the book either.<br />Chapters:  A Very Special Nurse, Cells Gone Berserk, Self-Esteem and the Cancer Patient, Special Problems, Family in Turmoil, If Cancer Strikes a Child, Is God Always Good?, The Ultimate Hope, Our Human Emotions, Living Above Circumstances, Facing Difficult Situations, Why me, God?, Lord, Teach Us to Pray, What About Miracles?, If I Should Die.<br />Highly, highly recommended, especially for all chaplains in their official duty.	2004-03-19

The good news:  There is a way to treat every phobic problem.  This book covers the methods, many of which are self-help based.<br />The treatments this author details that involve simple exercises, an ordinary rubber band, a tape recorder, the right foods, or a thermometer are ingenious and every sufferer ought to learn what these are used for.<br />Also in the book:  What causes phobia?  How you can treat any phobic problem.  Which quick-fix strategy can snap you out of an attack.  A state-by-state resource directory to specialists, clinics, and support groups (though dated, it is also very valuable to know which ones have still been operating since this book was first published).	2004-03-19

Physically well-designed and aesthetically beautiful, the &quot;faux&quot; or imitation leather cover of the hardback edition has a very artistic faux engraving or imprint on the cover as well as gold lettering on the spine in the tradition of fine quality books.<br />The National Geographic Society did an incredible high-quality job on this one!  The book contains more than 130 color photographs.  Both the writers and photographers joined wagon-train reenactments to get a hands-on feel for their subject matter.  The journals and letters of the original trailblazers were researched to help bring to life the joys and pains of the trails.<br />The trails (chapters) are these:  The Sante Fe Trail, The Oregon Trail, The Mormon Trail, The California Trail, The Gila Trail, The Bozeman Trail.<br />Highly recommended for those interested in the history of the pioneers or those who will be traveling or sightseeing in the areas of the trails.	2004-03-11

The terrific style, which helps to build interest and curiosity, is written so that the person is not named until the end of the story, much as in the teasing style of radio personality Paul Harvey.  In fact, the Preface states that the biographical sketches in this book were originally broadcast over the Mutual Radio Network!<br />Besides being a fascinating and entertaining piece of recreational reading for everybody, this book is superbly suited for homeschoolers and for readings to children.

This particular group of interviews is probably found nowhere else together like this.<br />Though written with the author's definite Christian perspective and approach to the interviewees, there is so much fascinating human interest in these stories that non-Christians can enjoy the read, too.  These are really &quot;intimate interviews,&quot; since the degree of frankness about doubts, depression, and family problems may surprise some readers.<br />The interviewees are these:  Jack Lousma (astronaut), Johnny Cash (singer), Tom Landry (head coach of Dallas Cowboys), Arthur DeMoss (insurance executive), Wesley Pippert (UPI White House Correspondent), Valery Moorhead and Ellen Armstrong (two Congressional wives), Charles Colson (prison fellowship), Billy Graham (evangelist), and George Thomas (Speaker, British House of Commons).	2004-03-07

The author, Ogden, states that his purpose in this book is to answer that question.<br />Ogden's book and personal story is not the one of a wistful daydreamer.  He writes honestly and straightforwardly about the grim realities of making such a move.<br />Ogden's personal move itself is a great drama -- full of courage and the reward of serenity -- but the practical wisdom passed on in this book goes far beyond that.  What are the problems of stone-lined wells?  Should you even seriously consider farming at all, and, if not, what are alternative sources of country income?<br />For anyone who has ever considered or dreamt of being a &quot;homesteader,&quot; this book will likely teach or guide you in things you had not ever considered before.	2003-12-27

These latter two men were both active participants in the great drama -- there in person as eyewitness accounts -- and also give their reasons in answer to the same question of why the North won.	2003-12-18

The editing, spelling, and research sections are very well done.  There are chapters on business letters, resumes, diction, narration, argument, making yourself clear, documenting sources, punctuation and mechanics.<br />This is probably the best single collection of all this material for a writer that I have ever seen in one book!  I would recommend this book to both native-English writers and also ESL/EFL learners who are writing in English not as their first language.  For them especially, this book would help them make a great leap to first-rate or even professional writing quality!<br />If I'd have any complaint, it is that the authors obviously chose mostly politically-correct (&quot;PC&quot;) topics for their &quot;Reader&quot; section of the book.  All the &quot;diversity&quot; articles over and over get old quick and I would not want to find &quot;Women's Issues&quot; in a book like this at all, which is not the place for pushing an author's PC agendas!

The authors make the case that school, family and church are no longer doing their former &quot;social institution&quot; job of straightforward matchmaking.  (Sometimes I wonder if the societies still practicing &quot;arranged marriages&quot; end up with any more or less suffering to family life than &quot;modern&quot; Americans do!)<br />The case histories from single men and women, anecdotes, &quot;game plans,&quot; strategies, and ideas are thought-provoking and sometimes inspiring.

What I like best is how this book presents the &quot;other side&quot; and takes you inside the mindset of the salesman:  the deal from the seller's perspective.  The author reveals certain &quot;trade secrets&quot; and explains why the wife, and not the husband, is the most feared element by the salesman.  He also tells why shopping and buying on separate days is vital.  Discover why you should take a friend along.

Silas served under Gen. Nathaniel Banks in Lousiana, then boarded a steamer and served under Sheridan and Ord.<br />I must differ slightly with the Amazon-indicated reading level for the book in the listing. This book is written in daily diary form -- as Silas did it -- and thus it seems great reading for me for adult readers of any age, in addition to the student levels indicated.  This book should definitely interest collectors of Civil War soldier \\"war diaries,\\" Union firsthand accounts, anyone who studies the battle history in Louisiana and Virginia, the Red River Siege, and anyone with family named Newton or Cross or who lived in Clinton, Iowa, or Lawton, Oklahoma, where Silas lived!<br />As a Civil War veteran and diarist, Silas owned a restaurant and inn in Lawton and lived till 1918!	2003-04-10

This is a comprehensive guide for new and prospective cockatiel owners.  I found it very thorough, since it covers everything from preparing a cage to providing the healthiest and most nutritious foods.<br />The health care section, worth the price of the book alone, advises owners not only on treatment of injuries and diseases, but tells how to avoid problems in the first place.  The illustrations are helpful.  The stunning color photos are some of the most phenomenal I have ever seen in any pet book!<br />If that weren't enough for the average pet lover, there are also tips on breeding, training, and selecting these wonderful creatures!  Enjoy!	2003-03-05
