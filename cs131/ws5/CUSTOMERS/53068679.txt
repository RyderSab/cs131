Her cast of characters became a part of me as I read, and her matter-of-fact rendition of persons with disabilities was  both poignant and realistic. What a grand romance, too! Highly recommended.	1999-10-03

The heroine's dearly mourned mother leaves her a horse trailer, a lifetime supply of Mary Kay cosmetics, and an old barrel racing mare. Her  quest  leads her to a most unexpected man!

It's my first by this author and I quickly surmised that it is a sequel, but that was on special order, so I  went ahead and read this one anyway. It stands alone as a pretty powerful   work of fiction  that stayed with me after I'd finished. (a 2-sitting read  because I was caught up in the characters. I am not a frequent reader of sf  and/or apocalyptic fiction, but this is a wonderful novel anyone would  enjoy. I was pleased to see the character names were as ordinary as the  circumstances were extraordinary! These people seemed familiar, flawed, and  ultimately heroic.	1999-07-02

All these 5-star reviews might make you suspicious that this author has a  really big family.  But I swear, I've never met her, just read the book on  a recommendation. It was completely riveting. Suspenseful, painfully   honest, thought-provoking. I was reminded somewhat of MIDWIVES by  Chris  Bohjalian and THE MOST WANTED by Jacqueline Mitchard, but I felt THE PACT  was more suspenseful and better  written. Not a &quot;comfortable&quot;  read due to the subject matter, but a wonderful read. Believe all the  passionate reviews here.	1999-06-20

The main character suffers one event, at age 3, that directs the entire course of her life. And like signposts along  the way, she keeps having  encounters with the most amazing guy...until  they finally realize what it all means and put it all together. How  intriguing is that?

Still, I was  hoping for a book that did more than skim the surface of the issues facing a writer. The  section on genres was particularly weak, which is  a pity. Best to go back  to the classics: Strunk &amp; White, EM Forster, John Gardner.  Disappointing.	1999-05-10

In fact, I stayed up late just to see how the plot would unfold. This story is so unique, it's hard to describe except maybe as a &quot;Flowers for  Algernon&quot; about a woman's face. &lt;G&gt; Born with a disfigurement,  Charlotte is made beautiful by the miracle of cranio-facial  surgery and  becomes a big star. But a reaction to the surgery forces her to choose   between her new, gorgeous  face or undoing the reconstruction. There are  two compelling men involved, a touching romance, and a race against the  clock to see which path Charlotte will choose. Cool, huh?	1999-04-10
