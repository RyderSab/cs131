Llegó a una perspectiva de lucha intransigente contra el racismo, las guerras y el saqueo económico que son productos del sistema capitalista. Fundó su estrategia de lucha y su optimismo en una perspectiva internacional de las luchas de los oprimidos en contra los opresores, y sobre todo en contra los ricos norteamericanos y su gobierno.<br /> El libro Malcolm X habla a la juventud presenta  cinco de sus discursos en encuentros con jóvenes y estudiantes en los Estados Unidos, Africa y Inglaterra durante el último año de su  vida, antes de su asesinato en febrero de 1965.  Por todo el mundo, dijo, son los jóvenes &quot;quienes realmente se dedican a la lucha para eliminar la opresión y la explotación.&quot; Pero cualquier trabajador, campesino o activista luchando en pro de la justicia y un digno futuro para la humanidad puede ganar mucho en leer y estudiar estos textos. <br /> El libro, por primera vez editado en español, también contiene muchas fotos, notas y un prefacio que ayuda al lector a conocer y valorar los tiempos y luchas de Malcolm X. ¡No lo pierdas!	2003-07-06

You see him grappling with the complex questions posed by the degeneration of the Russian Revolution and its leading party, and the tactical challenges posed in waging a political fight at a time when it was still possible to return the party to its original, revolutionary course. You can learn a lot from his writings on world developments and debates over what revolutionists should do: revolutionary and class struggles in China, Britain and Germany, shifting economic and political relations among the imperialist powers, and much more.<BR> <BR> I'd suggest studying this book along with some of Trotsky's other major writings, including The Revolution Betrayed, Leon Trotsky on China, and The Stalin School of Falsification.

Published in an inexpensive format, this bulletin brings together a number of reports and resolutions on women's oppression and the fight for women's liberation adopted by the Socialist Workers Party in the late 1970s. <BR> <BR> These articles document the deep social changes that made possible the rise of mass women's movements in the 1960s and 1970s. They survey developments in many countries around the world, from the most developed capitalist powers, though neo-colonial and third world nations, to the countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. They record the impressive history of gains won, and the many challenges still to be met.<br /> I particularly like the spirit of accomplishment and determination to really set society on a new footing that comes through these documents. They reflect the confidence coming out of years of participation in mass protest movements, and the reality of winning changes in women's place in modern society.  There is rich material on the theoretical and political debate over the origins of women's oppression, its connection to class society, on norms and standards of conduct among revolutionaries, and the long-term perspective for building a new society free from oppression and exploitation.<br /> I'd also recommend reading the Marxist classic The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, by Frederick Engels; Problems of Women's Liberation and Is Biology Women's Destiny? by Evelyn Reed; Women and the Cuban Revolution, edited by Betsy Stone; and The Changing face of U.S. Politics: Working-Class Politics and the Trade Unions, by Jack Barnes.	2003-05-04

This is a huge and wonderful book-- three volumes in one book, some 1200 pages in all. The story Trotsky lays out is most inspiring and encouraging: how revolutionary-minded workers and peasants in Russia, led by the Bolshevik party, overthrew the centuries-old Czarist monarchy, defeated the attempts to impose a capitalist dictatorship and went on to establish a worker and peasant revolutionary government, opening the road to the possibility of building a socialist society. It's a book you can read repeatedly, getting more out of it each time.<br /> Trotsky explains with rich detail the growing social crisis that wracked Russia, the devastating impact of World War I, the economic collapse, and the incapacity of the old regime to offer any way out. He takes up political developments amongst workers and peasants and the oppressed nationalities of the Russian Empire, including the many millions forced into the Russian army. You understand their growing conviction that the old society had to be and could be overturned and a new order established. And Trotsky gives real insight into the leadership that made possible an actual revolution under these conditions-- the development of the Bolshevik party led by V.I. Lenin and it's successful fight to win the allegiance of the struggling millions.<br /> Trotsky was, along with Lenin, a central leader of the 1917 revolution and of the government it established. After Lenin's death in 1924, he led the international fight to defend the Bolshevik's revolutionary course against the conservative and reactionary bureaucracy headed by Joseph Stalin that came to power later in the Soviet Union. This work was a key part of Trotsky's efforts to make the real facts and lessons 1917 available to future generations of workers, farmers and radicalizing young people. Read it along with some of his many other important works, including The Transitional Program for Socialist Revolution, In Defense of Marxism, The Revolution Betrayed, and The Struggle Against Fascism in Germany.	2003-04-27

Un país pequeño, con apenas 100 mil habitantes, pero con una rica lucha revolucionaria estableció un gobierno de los trabajadores y campesinos. Junto con Cuba y  Nicaragua sandinista, Granada fue uno de los \\"tres gigantes\\" de aquellos años.  Granada enfrentó todos los problemas del mundo actual: la dominación del imperialismo, el subdesarrollo, el racismo.

Bea Hansen was a young auto worker, a union activist and a socialist in the 1950s. Her talk printed here focuses on the evolution of Walter Reuther, then present of the United Auto Workers, tracing his development from a militant-minded young student and worker into a career-minded, union bureaucrat looking to collaborate with the employers and their government in maintaining the status quo.<br /> Hansen gives a lively introduction to the massive struggles of millions of workers that forged the industrial unions in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s, and a sharp contrast of Reuthers political course with that of the great revolutionary working class leader Eugene V. Debs. This is an important story that is often hidden or falsified, and full of lessons for todays labor movement. This pamphlet also prints an article by Farrell Dobbs, a leader of the union battles in the Mid-Western United States in the 1930s, comparing Reuthers views with those of another top union bureaucrat, George Meany. <br /> On the same topic, Id also recommend reading Labors Giant Step: The first 20 years of the CIO, by Art Preis, Trade Unions in the Epoch of Imperialist Decay, by Leon Trotsky, and the Changing Face of U.S. Politics: Working class politics and the trade unions, by Jack Barnes.	2003-04-23

Lenin was a central leader of the 1917 Russian Revolution. These volumes cover the years 1929-1940, when Trotsky led the political fight world-wide to maintain the continuity of Bolshevik's revolutionary perspective and leadership against the reactionary policies imposed by the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union. Reading Trotsky carefully, one can learn a lot about history and about today's world, as well as how to apply Marxist methods to orient oneself for working-class political action.<br /> This volume includes more than 100 articles and letters. They cover topics ranging from the economic depression and the rising inter-imperialist tensions leading to World War II, to the Stalinist frame-up trials in the Soviet Union, the Spanish Civil War, and detailed leadership questions posed in workers movements in different countries at the time. These volumes are lively, pointed and have extensive notes and chronologies to aid the reader today. <br /> I'd also recommend some other titles written by Trotsky at this time, including The History of the Russian Revolution, The Fight Against Fascism in Germany, Trade Unions in the Epoch of Imperialist Decay, and The Transitional Program for Socialist Revolution, all available from the same publisher, Pathfinder Press.	2003-04-18

Trotsky speaks as a tested leader of mass working class struggles and aims not just to observe developments but to help others understand what change is possible if workers and toilers of the countryside organize in a revolutionary movement. And while world has changed since the 1920's, the underlying causes of conflicts have not, making this pamphlet all the more useful to help orient oneself today. <BR> <BR> The issues Trotsky explains should be very familiar to anyone in the early part of the 21st century: worldwide economic stagnation and poverty, sharper conflicts between major imperialist powers (France's 1923 invasion of Germany, the declining British empire, the rising American and Japanese empires), the first manifestations of fascism, the state of the labor movement. I found particularly useful Trotsky's observations on the forms of conflict Washington used in relation to the European powers, a `pacifist' imperialism that intervened militarily around the world. And they are wonderful example of the careful use of Marxism method in the scientific analysis of world developments. <br /> As follow-up, I'd recommend Leon Trotsky on Britain, the Struggle Against Fascism in Germany, In Defense of Marxism and The Spanish Revolution (1931-39).	2003-03-31

It discusses the social roots of terrorism, and argues strongly that it is an obstacle to developing the organized leadership necessary for millions of toilers to take destiny in their own hands and transform society for the good of all humanity. Trotsky bases his observations on the long history of terror in Czarist Russia, and counterposes it to the successful mass revolutionary struggle led by the Bolsheviks that did topple the Czarist regime, established a workers and peasants government and overthrow capitalism. <br /> This pamphlet also includes two articles from the 1930s. One explains why Trotsky and other revolutionary opponents of the Stalinist dictatorship that developed in the Soviet Union did not resort to terror. Another discusses Herschel Grynszpan, a Jewish youth who assassinated a Nazi official in Paris in 1938.  Trotsky identifies with the emotions that led to Grynzspans act and calls for workers protests to stop the French government from executing him. But he argues to all those capable of self-sacrifice in the struggle against despotism and bestiality: Seek another road! Not the lone revolutionary avenger but only a great revolutionary mass movement can free the oppressed.<br /> Other valuable writings by Trotsky on this question include:  How the Workers in Austria Should Fight Hitler, Individual Terror and Mass Terror, and A Revolutionary, not a Terrorist all from Writings of Leon Trotsky, 1935-36.

Imperialism and imperialist war, colonialism, revolutionary Marxism vs. Stalinism and Maoism, concepts of armed struggle, mass struggle, of  constructing a revolutionary party, the character of a workers and peasants government, of a workers-peasant alliance-- all were tested in the turbulent, living experience of social crisis, repression, war and massive worker and peasant uprisings.<BR> <BR> This lengthy collection brings together the writings of Leon Trotsky on China from 1925 to his death in 1940. Trotsky was, along with V. I. Lenin, a central leader of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the early years of the Communist International. After the death of Lenin in 1924, Trotsky led the fight against the degeneration of that revolution and the rise of a conservative, privileged bureaucracy headed by Josef Stalin. Revolutionary policies in China at the time were at the heart of the differences between revolutionaries and Stalinists.  Trotsky gives detailed and extensive analysis very useful today, both for the issues covered and as an example of how to use the Marxist method to orient revolutionary fighters in the living world.<br /> The collection includes a substantial introduction by long-time Chinese revolutionary Peng Shu-tse, covering the history of China during these years, which I found useful for putting Trotsky's writings in context. <br /> Also recommended: The Chinese Communist Party in Power, by Peng Shu-tse; The History of the Russian Revolution, by Leon Trotsky; and Capitalism's World Disorder, by Jack Barnes.	2003-02-02

The time was 1972, a time of radicalization and mass protests in the United States in response to the Civil Rights movement and Washington's war against Vietnam, and a time when the Palestinian struggle against the Zionist state of Israel was on the rise and winning support around the world. The Socialist Workers Party championed the Palestinian freedom struggle, and was one of several leftist organizations publicly attacked by the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League for this stance.<BR> Seidman's answer here to the B'nai B'rith is a concise explanation of the roots of Zionism and the establishment of the state of Israel as a pro-imperialist beachhead dependent on Washington's military, financial and political backing.  He argues that creating Israel through the brutal expulsion and oppression of the Palestinian people was no progressive answer to the oppression of Jews in Europe and elsewhere. Seidman exposes the hypocrisy of big business press and governments in decrying the deaths of Israeli athletes in the assault on the 1972 Olympics by the Palestinian organization Black September. And he gives a particularly interesting presentation of the Socialist Workers Party's role in fighting to force the U.S. government to admit Jewish refugees and other victims of fascist persecution in Europe in the 1930s and 1940s, and the horrible record of Zionist organizations that refused to challenge Washington on this.<BR> This pamphlet is short and to the point.

DuBois!  They're exciting, eye-opening and inspiring, a call to struggle for the best we can make of humanity.<br /> For much of the 20th century, W.E.B. DuBois was a leading figure in the fight against segregation, lynchings, race prejudice and oppression in the United States. He campaigned against the pervasive stereotypes of Afro-Americans, publicizing their accomplishments, abilities and stature as human beings. He challenged AFL unions and the Socialist party to reject the racist practices of the day and to united Black and white workers in a common struggle. He was outspoken opponent of colonial oppression and imperialist war and of the McCarthy witch hunt in the United States in the 1950s.<br /> There 36 articles and speeches cover a fascinating range of topics: from the Marcus Garvey movement in the 1920s to the debates on education and the role of Afro-Americans in the post-Civil War period, from the fight against lynching to the anti-colonial freedom struggles of the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> One of my favorites is his 1929 speech at the Chicago Forum where he debated a prominent racist, and white-supremecist, Lothrop Stoddard.  DuBois fiercely attacks the myths of race supremacy, arguing that whether \\"Nordic, Mediterranean, Indian, Chinese or Negro... the proofs of essential human equality of gift are overwhelming.\\" He exposes the economic interests behind race oppression and champions \\"the black and brown and yellow men [who] demand the right to be men.\\" Don't miss this one!	2003-01-03

He examines the political ideas the authors seek to portray through their novels, some more overtly than others. And he gives a reasoned assessment of the results, both as an expression of political ideas and as a literary work.

In the midst of a deep-going economic depression, bosses imposed massive layoffs and deep pay cuts, and workers responded. From Chicago to St. Louis to New York to Philadelphia, rail workers, iron workers, carpenters, meatpackers and others launched a wave of massive strikes and street protests. The bosses and their government mobilized all their forces against the workers: courts, the press, police, the national guard and federal troops. While the workers were eventually beaten in these battles, the lessons learned helped forge political class consciousness and lay the basis for further struggles.<br /> Foner's book is an exciting history of these days. He quotes extensively from labor and capitalist press of the day, from speeches and declarations by workers' leaders, and from government reports and documents to give a real feel of the roots of the uprising and the conflicting interests that lay behind it. I particularly found useful the description of what different workers leaders did at the time-- from conservative trade union presidents to militant socialists. Also the challenge and experiences of native-born and immigrant workers fighting together against their common exploiters. There is a lot to learn from this book today!<br /> While this book gives a rich detail of the day-to-day struggles in 1877, two others will help get a broader perspective on the key issues political posed: American Labor Struggles 1877-1934, by Samuel Yellen, and Revolutionary Continuity, Marxist Leadership in the U.S. 1948-1917, by Farrell Dobbs.	2002-12-17

The railroads have been one of the biggest money-makers for their wealthy owners from the mid-1800s on, and also one of the scenes of fierce strike battles as bosses brutally resisted workers' demands for better wages, job security and safer working conditions.<br /> I found Robert's detailed look at stock ownership of the railroads in the 1970s very helpful in figuring out how modern capitalism works, and an example that could be applied to other major industries. His discussion of why essential industries such as transportation cannot be left to the mercy of the profit needs of private capital is really relevant for anyone grappling with the economic crises of the 21st century.<br /> Roberts also presents a lively history of capital-labor struggles over the past 150 years.

This was a time when millions of workers grappled with the lessons of the Russian Revolution, while the deep conflicts in the world capitalist economy left unresolved by World War I were pointing toward the renewed slaughter of World War II. I find these are not just interesting historical questions, but remain at the heart of politics in the 21st century with its new economic crisis and resulting drive towards war.<BR> Trotsky's explanation of the decline of the British Empire and the shifting balance of power among the imperialist powers, especially with the rise of the United States, is a model for analyzing the world today. <BR> So are his writings on working class political strategy. Bosses attacks against workers in Britain provoked a near-revolutionary general strike in 1926.  However, the course followed by the new Communist Party in Britain, directed by the conservative Stalinist bureaucracy rising in the Soviet Union, failed to advance the struggle towards a workers seizure of power. Trotsky's writings criticizing the Stalinist course in Britain were an early part of his fight against the degeneration of the Russian Revolution-- and full of rich lessons for today.<BR> Check out other writings by Trotsky such as Leon Trotsky on France, The Struggle Against Fascism in Germany, Leon Trotsky on the Spanish Revolution, and The Revolution Betrayed. And for current analysis of the world and working class politics, I'd recommend: Capitalism's World Disorder, Their Trotsky and Ours, and Cuba and the Coming American Revolution, all by U.S. revolutionary Jack Barnes.	2002-12-01

More than a history text, this is a compelling day-by-day analysis of the great political developments in France during the 1930s depression-- and incisive arguments for what working class parties needed-- and failed -- to do to fight their way victoriously out of the crisis. The brutal economic depression and the crisis of capitalist political rule, the approaching world war, the fascist uprising in 1934, the rise of Bonapartist-police state regimes, the great workers strike wave of 1936, the stakes in organizing a workers militia, the political basis for alliances in working class struggles-- all are explained clearly and logically, with the aim of helping working people understand and organize to defend their interests.<br /> Trotsky writes with the experience of a leader of the 1917 Russian Revolution and the early years of building an international communist workers movement. He was particularly familiar with the French workers movement from years in exile before 1917, and spent time in France in the 1930s after being expelled from the Soviet Union by Stalin and his henchmen-- this experience helping him give rich political detail to his writings.<br /> Above all, the questions posed here do not belong just to the 1930s. The perspectives of the capitalists, the petty-bourgeoisie, the workers and the peasants, and the question of leadership of the working class, of the forging of a revolutionary party with a correct program and the confidence to act are issues for today and tomorrow. Trotsky's writings here are invaluable in helping understand and organize in today's world.	2002-10-24

Farrell Dobbs was a young worker in the Minneapolis coal yards who quickly became a leader of these strikes and organizing campaigns, as well as a member and then leader of the Socialist Workers Party.<BR> The first three volumes (Teamster Rebellion, Teamster Power, Teamster Politics-- don't miss them!) take up the important strikes in Minneapolis in 1934, the subsequent over-the-road organizing campaign throughout the upper Midwest, and the vital and complex political challenges militant workers took on in confronting the employers, their government, cops and finks, and reactionary, class-collaborationist trade union officials.<BR> Teamster Bureaucracy draws some of the broadest lessons for working class fighters from those years of struggle. Facing the intense political pressure of the opening years of WWII, the Stalin-Hitler pact, frame-ups by the FBI, the drive by Teamsters international president Daniel Tobin (aiding and aided by the Roosevelt administration) to crack down on militant local unions -- this book is full or rich experiences we can learn from today.

James P. Cannon was a young organizer for the IWW and early Socialist Party, a founding member and leader of the Communist Party in the United States in the 1920s, and central leader of the cadre who fought to maintain the Bolshevik's revolutionary course against the Stalinist degeneration of the Soviet Union and Communist International from the late 1920s on. <br /> Here you will find week-by-week, sometimes day-by-day, news, analysis, and proposals for action. Cannon writes as a participant and leader of a workers party involved in organizing coal miners, textile strikes, the big 1933 New York hotel strike, the historic Minneapolis Teamsters strikes of 1934.  He takes up key international questions: the evolution of the Stalinist leadership in the Soviet Union, the rise of fascism in Germany, and the difficult, persistent efforts led by Leon Trotsky to rebuild a new revolutionary international movement. Many of his writings detail questions of party leadership, lessons of faction and tendency struggles, or answer key practical questions: \\"what to do next?\\"<br /> I'd strongly suggest reading this along with Cannon's \\"History of American Trotskyism\\" that covers the same historic period, \\"Teamster Rebellion\\"  by Farrell Dobbs,  and current writings that pick up the struggle today, including \\"Their Trotsky and Ours\\" and \\"Capitalism's World Disorder\\" by Jack Barnes.	2002-09-28

I read everything by George Novack that I can get my hands on-- all his works on politics, history and philosophy. He has a way of presenting ideas precisely and clearly, and of explaining the historical setting and importance of each one. And while he meets high academic standards, he writes directly for working people who want to understand the world and figure out how to act to change it. He helps you see why questions of materialism vs. idealism, dialectics vs. formal logic, history and change are important and helps you grapple with them seriously.<br /> Here Novack gives a sweeping overview of the rapidly changing Greek society over five centuries BC. He explains not only what happened in the great development of human ideas, philosophy, logic, reason and scientific inquiry, but also why it was possible and likely that they would occur when they did. <br /> I strongly recommend some of Novack's other works as well, including: America's Revolutionary Heritage, Democracy and Revolution, The Logic of Marxism, and Polemics in Marxist Philosophy.	2002-08-24

Here are key documents of the African National Congress, including the Freedom Charter that became the central document of the mass movement that brought down apartheid. Also Mandela's speeches at different stages of the struggle, including historic courtroom addresses when he was on trial for his life; documents Mandela prepared as the apartheid regime was forced to negotiate with him and the ANC in the late 1980s; and  his first speeches after he was released from prison in 1990.<BR> These speeches give a vivid reminder of the brutal, racist regime that was apartheid (and we should never forget that the South African regime was a pillar of U.S. domination in Africa from the 1940s on.) Mandela gives us a real feel for the determined, difficult, and courageous struggle of millions of people who never accepted submission to apartheid and the world-wide importance of the fight for a democratic, nonracial  South Africa.

Lively  because of the format -- the actual transcripts of live debates -- and because of the importance of the questions posed: should activist and militant workers fighting to change U.S. society work for or within the two-party system, specifically for the Democratic Party (the so-called Lesser Evil)? In each case, leaders of the Socialist Workers Party championing independent political action take on prominent social democrats arguing for working within the Democratic Party.<br /> These debates took place in the midst of political struggles in 1959, 1965 and 1976. They are shaped by the tremendous labor upsurge of the 1930s and 1940s that forged the industrial unions of the CIO, the massive civil rights movement and the movement against the U.S. war in Vietnam-- times when millions of working people and youth took to the streets and challenged the policies and rulers of this country. I find the historical examples cited and the lessons drawn very relevant for today.<br /> Read these debates, weigh the arguments, and decide for yourselves! I'd also recommend some further useful reading including: Labor's Giant Step: 20 years of the  CIO, by Art Preis; Out Now!

The articles and speeches in this volume amply illustrate two points Cannon stresses time and again: the importance of political program, starting from a working-class world view, in building a revolutionary leadership; and the importance of knowing what to do next and doing it, based on the objective reality confronting the movement at any given time.<br /> Cannon's writings here also present fascinating details of the working class struggle from these years, including the onset of the 1930s depression, defense campaigns for workers framed up and imprisoned by the bosses and their courts, and important strikes by miners, textile and garment workers in the United States.

It's the first in a 14-volume collection of writings by Leon Trotsky, one of the central leaders of the 1917 Russian Revolution. This one has over 75 articles, letters and interviews written between February and December 1929.<br /> This volume opens just as Trotsky was expelled from the Soviet Union by the bureaucratic misleaders headed by Joseph Stalin, who were increasingly fearful of any political debate in the country. Trotsky had been leading a political fight to reorient the Soviet Communist Party back to the revolutionary course it had followed in the early years of the revolution, before the death of V.I. Lenin.  His writings here take up new developments in the Soviet Union, the challenges facing revolutionists -- especially clarifying their political perspectives and tasks under unexpected and difficult conditions, as well as major developments in world politics.

Jack Barnes bases his analysis on political work done by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels and leaders of the Russian Revolution V.I. Lenin and Leon Trotsky. He discusses lessons socialists in the United States had already drawn, and then takes a fresh look in light of the 1979 worker and peasant revolutions in Nicaragua and Grenada and the debate they sparked on revolutionary strategy. <br /> The discussion takes up issues where there have often been differences among revolutionary organizations, including the character of alliances between workers and peasants or farmers, the role of armed struggle and electoral campaigns, and the type of the government to establish after overthrowing a capitalist regime. Barnes stresses the importance of the Cuban Revolution, both for the example it sets and the conscious efforts of the Cuban leadership to advance revolutionary leadership development around the world.	2002-06-13

When the U.S. government was leading the country into the slaughter of World War II, the Roosevelt administration sought to crackdown on dissent and militancy among the working class. One step they took was to adopt the Smith Act, a witch-hunting thought control act, and then to indict leaders of the labor movement and the Socialist Workers Party on charges of subversion and conspiracy. The socialists rose to the challenge however, turned the trial into a platform to explain their anti-capitalist views to a wide audience. Their years-long defense campaign also played an important role in sustaining the revolutionary movement throughout the war years.<BR> Socialism in Trial is the actual court transcript of the testimony of James P. Cannon, then national secretary of the Socialist Workers Party. Under the hostile questioning of the prosecutor, he calmly and concisely lays out what is wrong with capitalism, and why socialism and communism are the necessary alternative for working people. Cannon takes up imperialism, war, colonialism, and fascism; and discusses trade union struggles, how a revolutionary party is organized, defends the Russian Revolution and takes on the reactionary Stalinists then in power in Moscow.<BR> The book also includes an exchange between Cannon and fellow-revolutionary Grandizo Munis who attacked the socialists' approach to defending themselves in a capitalist court.  Cannon's reply should be studied by activists everywhere, all of whom are likely to face similar challenges and need to understand the rich lessons of previous defense campaigns.<BR> Read it and share it with others!	2002-06-13

The protests and campaigns described here were an essential foundation for the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and should inspire us to continue the fight today. <br /> Here are some 150 articles, pamphlets and political resolutions, a week-by-week account of political developments and struggles during tumultuous years of the 1940s. They come from the socialist newsweekly, the Militant, and are written by working class leaders seeking to build on the labor battles of the 1930s and to deepen the fight against racist oppression.<BR> <BR> The articles document instances of police brutality and killings, lynch-mob murders of Blacks, and the pervasive racist discrimination in employment, housing and the military. But above all, they record, analyze and promote the fight against these conditions. The success in uniting Black and white workers to smash Henry Fords anti-union stronghold and bring the UAW to Ford Motor Co., the mass protests of the 1942 March on Washington Movement-- and the bitter opposition of the Roosevelt administration to this anti-racist movement; the 1943 Harlem rebellion against killer cops-- \\"A protest against intolerable conditions;\\" its all here to learn from and be inspired by.

A lively and very informative collection of writings on U.S. history-- scientific, factual explanation of how and why things happened as they did. George Novack was a leading Marxist political activist and writer on philosophy, history and politics. These articles aim to help us understand events so as to learn from the past to organize to change society today.<br /> The book takes up the fight for independence and the 1776 revolution, slavery and the genocidal wars against Native Americans and their role in the development of U.S. capitalism,  the  rise of Big Business monopolies, the capitalist two-party system, and the emergence of the United States as an empire-building world power. I found particularly useful the explanation of political and social forms that are often presented almost as divine wonders (the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the so-called \\"system of checks and balances,\\" etc.) and their actual roots in the particular development of a class divided society on the North American continent. And particularly inspiring the stories of the revolutionary fighters who struggled against the misery, oppression and barbarity of this rising capitalist society, including Tom Paine,  Mercy Otis Warren, John Brown and Martin R. Delaney.<br /> I'd recommend reading this along with the two-volume series Revolutionary Continuity by Farrell Dobbs that traces the complicated and persistent efforts to forge a revolutionary working class movement in the United States from 1848 through 1922.	2002-05-19

The Great Depression; the bitter competition between the American, German, British, French and Japanese empires and the resulting drive towards world war; fascism and how to fight  it; colonial exploitation from Latin America to India and China; the reactionary degeneration of the Russian Revolution and the Stalin-Hitler pact--  its all here in these writings.<br /> Although exiled from the Soviet Union by Stalin and his henchmen, Trotsky worked tirelessly to rebuild the international working class movement along the lines charted by Marx and Engels and put in practice by Lenin and the early Bolshevik leadership. His writings here aim at arming and preparing militant youth and workers for decisive political struggles at this time of world crisis. They include material on the founding of the Fourth International and the challenges faced by its different national parties, trade union policies and struggles, the debate over individual terrorism, the need for a revolutionary youth organization and much more.<br /> This is part of a 14-volume Writings of Leon Trotsky collection.

This book presents a selection of the speeches of Malcolm X, an outstanding revolutionary leader who emerged from the struggles of millions of Afro-Americans against racism in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. Although he was assassinated in February 1965, Malcolm X left us an invaluable example and political legacy.<br />Malcolm X linked the struggle within the United States with the struggles of other oppressed peoples in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Just read his denunciations of U.S. intervention in the Congo, in Vietnam and the Middle East in those days -- and think today of Colombia, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Iran, the Philippines...<br />I particularly enjoyed the following speeches from this book: \\"I'm not an American but a victim of Americanism,\\" (University of Ghana, May 1964); \\"Our problems and those of Africa are the same,\\" (Harlem, November 1964); \\"Learn to see, to listen and to think for yourself,\\" (Harlem, January 1965); \\"We seek a solution that will benefit the masses, not the upper class'\\" (Detroit, February 1965); and the article \\"The meeting between Malcolm X and Fidel Castro,\\" (Hotel Teresa, Harlem, September 1960).	2002-05-07

The specific facts of the struggle for power in China in the late 1940s as part of the anti-colonial revolutions that swept much of the Third World after World War II; The U.S. war in Korea and the response of the Chinese worker and peasants; the twists and turns of the Maoist leadership once in power-- its all covered here.

Our Power Is That of the Working People (English and Spanish Edition)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Vital documents from the Cuban revolution	In the first speech in this book, \\"This is Democracy!,\\" given to a mass rally on May Day 1960, Cuban leader Fidel Castro discusses the new society that was beginning to be built in revolutionary Cuba after the 1950 overthrow of the U.S.-backed Batista dictatorship. The more than twenty speeches printed here detail the revolutionary course charted by leaders of the Cuban revolution and their response to big challenges along the way, from U.S. and Cuban capitalist attacks, lies and slanders to bureaucratic misleaders that developed within Cuba itself.<br /> Many of the speeches are from the 1970s, difficult years for Cuba given the failure of revolutionary movements elsewhere in Latin America and strong pressure to adapt to the bureaucratic methods and practices of the Soviet Union. I'd recommend reading this along with another book of Fidel's speeches, \\"Cuba's Internationalist Foreign Policy,\\"--  that details the worldwide perspective of solidarity and the selfless assistance Cuba gave to others fighting for their freedom at this time.<br /> The last speeches come from the early 1980s, after the worker and peasant revolutions in Nicaragua and Grenada gave new impetus to Cuban revolutionaries. You can see the seeds of the deep-going changes Fidel and the Cuban leadership led forward in the mid-1980s in the campaign known as \\"rectification.\\" You can also read more about this in the book \\"In Defense of Socialism,\\" a collection of Fidel's speeches from the late 1980s.	2002-05-06

It is full of rich lessons for today-- including of the role of the so-called western democracies, the governments of the United States, Britain and France, in undermining this struggle for fear of unleashing a deep-going workers revolution.<br /> This fight went down to defeat, but the leadership lessons to be learned from this experience are invaluable today. The need for workers to organize independent of the parties and policies of the bosses, bankers and landowners; the importance of championing land reform for poor  peasants and the rights of oppressed nationalities (in Spain's African colonies for example) as a precondition for forging unity in struggle, come through in vivid detail here. Also the sharp test in practice of the disastrous policies of different political currents vying for workers and peasants support: from the Moscow-led Communist Party, to the anarchists and the POUM. <br /> Written as the civil war unfolded, this book documents the tremendous capacity of ordinary working people to fight oppression and change society, and the crying need for a leadership capable of leading this movement forward.	2002-05-02

Aquí hay dos discursos magníficos por destacados dirigentes revolucionarios: Nelson Mandela de Sudáfrica y Fidel Castro de Cuba, en ocasión de la visita de Mandela a Cuba en 1991.  <br /> Mandela acaba de haber salido de la cárcel en Sudáfrica, después de cumplir 28 años de una condena perpetua por su lucha contra el sistema racista del apartheid.  Su visita a Cuba tuvo una importancia especial, dado en papel imprescindible de cientos de miles de voluntarios cubanos en la lucha militar contra la invasión de Angola por el ejército sudafricano. La derrota de los invasores en la histórica batalla de Cuito Cuanavale en 1988 abrió una nueva y exitosa etapa en la lucha contra el apartheid. También fue una experiencia importante que fortaleció la conciencia revolucionaria en Cuba, haciendo posible avances contra la presión del capitalismo y el burocratismo.<br /> El título del libro \\"¡Que lejos hemos llegado los esclavos!\\" viene del discurso de Fidel, hablando de los raíces africanos de los pueblos de Cuba y de todo el Caribe.

Read the messages and transcripts of speeches given during the whirlwind of the October Revolution in Russia-- a working class leader in day-by-day action. <BR> <BR> And especially worth studying, Trotsky's talks to gatherings of workers, soldiers, and party members analyzing the changing relations between the major world powers and between the toiling and exploiting classes of those nations, and the different policies pursued by the new Soviet government as these circumstances changed-- you'll learn a lot about how society works and what it takes to really change it.	2002-05-01

A central leader of the Russian Revolution, though exiled by Stalin in the late 1920s, Trotsky writes with enduring confidence in the capacity of workers to learn, organize and fight.<br /> The economic collapse of the Great Depression; the rise of mass fascist movements; the drive of the Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States towards world war; leadership challenges facing working people, especially with the rise of Stalinism and the subordination of once-revolutionary Communist Parties to the conservative policies of Moscow's bureaucrats-- it's all here, with facts and clear, sharp analysis.<br /> In reading these pages, I was constantly drawn to make comparisons with the opening of the 21st century, from the rise of Le Pen in France and fascist movements in the U.S., the growing use of military force by Washington, and the spreading resistance of working people looking for a way out of the crisis we face. The big difference, of course, is the recent collapse of the Stalinist regimes and the myth that Moscow of the 1930s represented a revolutionary way forward. <br /> These writings are be an invaluable aid in understanding society today and figuring out what needs to be done next.

This is a wonderful collection of articles written for the socialist press over more than thirty years, and masterful examples of sharp writing that clarifies, educates and inspires. <br /> Cannon writes from the midst of workers' struggles, from the international defense campaigns to defend victims of capitalist frame-ups, to the powerful strikes of truck drivers, seamen and other workers in the 1930s, from the bloody upheaval of World War II to the subsequent wars of colonial conquest Washington waged in Korea and Southeast Asia. Some of his pieces are biting exposes of the hypocrisy and brutality of capitalist society; others take on big questions of leadership and organization posed to working class activists striving to form militant trade unions and revolutionary political parties. <br /> I found particularly compelling Cannon's observations on the character and lives of the many militants and leaders of workers struggles he knew and worked with over decades, including Eugene Debs, Big Bill Haywood, Frank Little, Sacco and Vanzetti. And as a counterpart, his biting analysis of labor bureaucrats, and the cops, courts, politicians and bosses of the capitalist class who strive so hard to keep workers enslaved in their profit-driven society.	2002-04-28

Although I am not particularly familiar with jazz, I found this book a fascinating. <br /> Kofsky's work takes on the white-owned big-business music establishment, debunking their myths and prejudices. He explains the evolution of jazz in the context of the changing social conditions of Afro-Americans-- not least of which are the social struggles they waged, from the battles to unionize industry in the 1930s to the civil rights and Black power movements of the 1960s. He details the use and abuse of human beings-- the actual musicians-- by the recording industry and club owners in their relentless pursuit of profits from the labor of others.<br /> Kofsky has extensive chapters on the rhythms and other musical innovations of Coltrane and those he worked with, material I found particularly challenging to work through, but which help to understand the real, complex questions Coltrane took on as an artist and why his contributions were so important and inspiring to others. Of particular interest is his discussion of the interrelations between Coltrane, Albert Ayler, Elvin Jones and other artists-- of the collective social process that makes artistic creation possible.	2002-04-17

This left some among workers and peasants as well as middle-class layers open to counter-revolutionary propaganda and actions. More recently, similar challenges arose in the Cuban revolution and the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, both of which faced years of murderous attacks by U.S.-organized counter-revolutionaries.<br /> \\"Kronstadt\\" reprints excerpts from contemporary speeches and reports by two central leaders of the Russian Revolution, V.I. Lenin and Leon Trotsky, as well as later articles by Trotsky drawing lessons of the experience. They explain the roots of the crisis and the measures taken by the revolutionary government to suppress the uprising.

The discussion takes up the changing relations between men and women as human society has evolved from earliest times to today's class-divided society, debunks the notion of an eternal standard of beauty, and much more. <br /> It's also a wonderful example of how to analyze and understand political and social questions from the standpoint of the interests of working people and not succumb to the prejudices and fetishes of capitalist society. You see how political activists can thrash out sharp differences over tough questions in the framework of an open exchange of views.<br /> An extensive introduction covers the impact of the capitalist crisis of the 1980s on women and the decline of the mass women's rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s.	2002-03-27

Trotsky was assigned to organize and lead the new Red Army that defended revolutionary Russia (later the Soviet Union) from foreign capitalist intervention and counterrevolutionary civil war from 1918-1923.<br /> Here, Trotsky takes up questions about political and military strategy and tactics posed in wide-ranging debates that went on in the Bolshevik Party and Red Army at that time. He provides though-provoking analysis of the shifting relations among the major world powers in the early 1900s, especially under the impact of WWI and the Russian Revolution, and the necessary decisions made at different points by the leaders of the Soviet workers and peasants. <br /> Best of all, this is a detailed example of the Marxist method of orienting oneself in face of changing circumstances and figuring out what to do next, the art of politics as well as war. Trotsky stresses that this cannot be done by hasty generalizations or simplifications, or by finding and just applying a few general principles. It takes hard work, careful attention to facts and details, and accurate assessment of the relations between different social classes, starting on a world scale.<br /> Workers today can learn a lot from this rich experience!	2002-03-18

Also includes articles by Jones written for labor and socialist papers of the time, press reports about her activities, and dozens of letters she wrote to other labor and socialist leaders.<BR> <BR> Mother Jones traveled incessantly, giving speeches and organizing coal miners and copper miners, textile workers, construction workers.  She exposed and decried the abuses of the capitalist system. She stood up to the richest employers, their cops, courts, the National Guard, the U.S. Congress and presidents. She championed workers framed-up and victimized in the course of many struggles-- including insurgent fighter from Mexico during its 1910 revolution.<BR> <BR> Her courage, honesty and perseverance should be a better-known example for workers, farmers and young people today. She has lots of short, snappy observations I find useful to raise at work, to help get others thinking a bit. And I found her letters, which reflect her striving to promote the most uncompromising, militant and class-conscious wing of unions and the Socialist Party, especially interesting.	2002-03-05

These are four speeches by Cuban leader Fidel Castro, given to mass rallies and meetings in 1989.  Castro gives a reasoned, factual defense of socialism as the way forward for humanity with a rich analysis of some of the sharpest conflicts in the world at that time, from the economic and social crisis in Third World countries to the U.S. war against Nicaragua and El Salvador.  Especially interesting is the detailed account of the South African invasion of Angola, Cuba's response of sending tens of thousands of volunteers to fight along with the Angolans, and of the death-blow dealt to apartheid in the battle at Cuito Cuanavale.<br /> Castro also explains some of the early history of the Cuban revolution, such as how workers and peasants, led by the Rebel Army, actually took power in 1959.  He takes up some of the big questions posed to anyone interested in building a new society, based on efforts the Cubans were then making to overcome bureaucratism, corruption and inefficiency.  What is the relation between the individual and society, material wages versus moral and political consciousness, the use of technology and its impact on workers lives?<br /> Don't miss this one!	2002-03-02

Revolutionists, from Karl Marx and Frederich Engels in the late 1800s to Lenin and Trotsky and other leaders of the 1917 Russian Revolution, championed the emancipation of  women.  This lively pamphlet is a good introduction to a rich history of debate and struggle, with examples from the United States, Germany, Britain, and Russia.<br /> Waters introduces you to the German revolutionists Clara Zetkin, Rosa Luxemburg, August Bebel; organizers of early American labor struggles such as Mother Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn; and Mary White Ovington, Rose Pastor Stokes and other leaders of the American Socialist Party in the early years of the 1900s. <br /> I found useful the excerpts from debates in 1914 in the American socialist magazine \\"New Review.\\" For example: the comment: \\"The Socialist who is not a feminist is lacking in breadth. The Feminist who is not a  Socialist is lacking in strategy.\\"   Or an article arguing for repeal of laws against contraceptives to end \\"attempts to enforce upon women the tyranny of accidental and unwelcome pregnancy.\\"<br /> In all--thought provoking and a pointer to further study on these important questions.	2002-03-02

Not just a  piece of history, but a story with inspiring lessons for working people in the new millennium. James Kutcher tells of radicalizing as a young man in the 1930s, impacted by the militant upsurge of labor that led to the formation of the autoworkers and other industrial unions; joining the Socialist Workers Party; being drafted and losing both legs in combat in WWII; and then being blacklisted by the government for his political views, losing his job with the Veterans Administration, his public housing, even his disability pension. The heart of the book is the persistent and courageous work of Kutcher and his supporters in waging a fight with big stakes for the democratic rights for all of us. Kutcher traveled the country, speaking to meetings and winning support from  trade unions, student and faculty groups, and civil rights and civil liberties organizations. This eight-year fight was successful in beating back the government attack on Kutcher, and provides important examples and lessons of organized leadership much needed by workers and farmers in today's world.	2002-02-16
