There are a lot of bad fantasy books coming out these days. Some almost mirror the work of Tolkien and his popular descendants such as Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan. Some of them lack character and subjective points of view so much that it's unbearable. This, however, is not one of those books. True, it shares somewhat of an average fantasy plot, but it's absolutely worth reading.  <br />Despite the mildly normal plot, Eldest is FAST. There's always some riveting event that only makes you want to keep turning the pages more and more until you've run out of them. The world the author has created is also quite fascinating. I think I could almost imagine myself living there, whereas while reading other fantasy books I think \\"Jeez, what would I do here if there wasn't a war going on?\\" <br />Also, Paolini does an excellent job balancing out the flaws in each race, which is unusual for a fantasy for the age group he's writing for and even for fantasy books in general. For instance, the elves, although they are powerful and wise, are sometimes contemptful towards the other races and think themselves too powerful to intervene. The Dwarves have many, many customs that vary from tribe to tribe, and very many conflicting opinions as well. One thing a Dwarf of one tribe may do can easily insult one of another. The Humans, of course, are much too ambitious, at times, and the Urgals are so dramatically different from the other races that they are hard to cope with. <br />Another thing Paolini does that is very unusual for a fantasy author is question the evil of the enemy. He doesn't do this to the point which Eragon goes to the other side, that would ruin the story, but it does a little bit. For instance, when Eragon is training with Oromis, Oromis says something along the lines of \\"Tell me Eragon, are Urgals evil?\\" Eragon says.\\"Yes.\\" Oromis says \\"Why?\\" Eragon is confused. He says,\\"I've seen them kill thousands of humans without thought. It's obvious they don't care for us.\\" Oromis replies\\"Perhaps they have reason not to.\\" Sure enough, some Urgals come up later who are willing to fight against Galbatorix. <br />Why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5 then? Well, although he shows great potential, Paolini is nevertheless an author who's writing needs to mature. For one, he really needs to improve on is dialogue. Eragon, a boy who grew up in a poor village in the mountains where he probably didn't get a whole lot of an education is constantly saying things like \\"Are all of your steeds as noble as these?\\" Sorry Mr. Paolini, but no. As well as this, there are some points when he sort of takes stuff right out of Lord of the Ring(they don't happen too much, but sometimes). For instance, he has the elves ride horses without saddles and speak to them in elvish to say where they want them to go. That's also a bit irritating. But even so, I encourage you all to read it.	2005-10-10

When I picked this book up, I expected it to be very...ordinary. I thought it was just your everyday sort of fantasy where good and evil have battles and there is a magic sword involved. As you probably have guessed by my five stars, I was wrong. There are just so many nice little fantastical elements to keep you going. For instance, this book sort of mooshes all different kinds of mythology together. We have some zesty Nordic fire giants and frost trolls, various Greek gods are called upon, such as Apollo, Hades, Helion, et cetera. In fact, Raven, a man from the Caucasus mountains is always referred to by higher powers as \\"son of Prometheus\\" (I don't know about you, but I can't resist trippy titles like that). Then we have some Celtic selkies, kelpies, and elves, as well as many references to King Arthur and his knights, and to Oberon and Titania. Even the archangel Uriel shows up in it. I don't know about all of you, but I find stuff like that exciting. As far as the actual writing is concerned, I found the characters very interesting, even the villains. I wouldn't say that they're quite as realistic as they come, but they're definately very interesting. First of all, we have Raven, a quiet man from the Caucasus mountains who's been here there and everywhere until he came to the United States. Then there's Wendy, his wife, who's part faerie and is always quite cheerful and childish. Then there's the Waylock family, Galen, Peter, and Lemuel, Peter being the one you get the most of. He's a soldier in a wheelchair who hasn't believed all the stuff his father Lemuel told him about the dreamworld, but now he's noticing that everything is true. <br />As for the plot, it speeds forward at a rocketing pace with all sorts of twists and turns that leave you racing to catch your breath. All I have to say is, I want the next book!	2005-08-24
US	32550917	RYZ9FWF1OLX9V	0684803852	90910415	Brat Farrar	Books	5	5	6	N	N	An incredibly well written book.	Whether you like mystery or not, this is an excellent book. First of all, the characterization is amazing. Each and every character is vivid and realistic, however extreme some of their personalities are. Even though Brat is an impostor, he's extremely likeable and you can't do anything but marvle at what an amazing impostor he is. As well as this, you end up becoming attached even to the characters that you don't like, such as Ruth, Simon, and Sheila Parslow Also, the plot is amazingly well developed. It builds up perfectly, for a while, you can't even tell it's going to be a mystery, then Brat becomes more and more curious and eventually realizes that the person he's pretending to be was murdered and by whom. It keeps on moving so rapid a pace that, by the end, it's nearly impossible to put the book down. The actual quality of the writing is just about as good as it gets. Don't hesitate, read it!	2005-05-19

I won't lie to you, this book is a bit hard to get into. It starts out a tad confusing and the writing starts out a little bit shaky and imature, but once you grasp the story and the way everything fits together, you won't be able to put it down. It's full of plot twists, exotic types of people, creatures, magic, and overall interesting characters. Honestly, what else can you ask for. <br />The book takes place in a land that has long been without a king and where to families, the Renne and the Wills have been warring for the crown but now have a sort of ceasfire. Toren Renne plans to return the Isle of Battle to the Wills in hope of ending the conflict, but his cousins fear that this will give them enough power to start the war again and plan to murder him to stop this. Meanwhile Elise Wills flees a marriage that will surely give her family enough power to start the war again, and after a group of young men share their fire with a stranger, they are persued by a large group of men at arms dressed in black. I won't spoil the rest for you. <br />Why four starts instead of five? As you can imagine this story is as complicated and bulky as any fantasy book out there. Most fantasy story's this complicated contain a map, a character list, or a glossary. Yet this book has none of these things, so I found myself having to figure things out on my own and flipping back to reread sections of the book. <br />Despite this, it's a great book and any fantasy fan should enjoy it.	2005-05-08

The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is one of those books that you hear everybody talking about and reccomending to you and that's been on the best seller list for the past couple of months. I felt that the only reason that I should read it was because everyone was talking about it so much;I didn't think I'd actually enjoy it. I was very wrong. <br />The main character, Christopher John Francis Boone, is autistic. Therefore to enhance the fact that he's autistic, the author writes the book sort of choppily, for example, there might be five paragraphs in a row that begin with the word \\"and\\". You come to understand the character's actions, no matter how extravagant and awkward, and begin to understand autistic people in general. As well as this, Christopher is bursting with bits of knowledge that are interesting to know as well as the story. <br />In the beginning of the book, Christopher finds his neighbor's dog impaled upon a garden fork in her yard. Having read Hound of the Baskerville's, he is very much into detective work and decides to try to figure out who killed the dog. The story just takes off from there and Christopher ends up hip deep in trouble and still manages to weasle his way out of it. <br />Don't hesitate, read this book!	2005-05-08

If you have liked any Tad Williams book, whether it's Tailchaser's song or The Dragonbone Chair, chances are this is a book for you. The world Williams creates is both believeable and exotic, with characters both appealing and heinous. The only difference is, Williams's writing at this point in his career, is much more developed and mature than he started out. For instance, the characters have much more to struggle with and are much more believable, and barely seem to rise much above their circumstances. The world, as I said before, is almost believable with an enthralling history, with an enchanting set of creatures such as wyverns, goblins, the Qar, Skimmers, Funderlings, Rooftoppers, and more. And, as usual, their is a sizeable glossary at the back of the book, naming characters, places, animals, things, and most of Tad's regulars. <br />The plot is not much unlike your average fantasy book. The mysterious Qar were driven off into the March Kingdoms and disappeared behind the misty Shadowline, and have stayed back for years and years. Now, they plan their revenge. The king of the March Kingdoms which they plan to invade first is held captive in a distant castle, therefore the task of ruling the kingdom is in the hands of his twin children Barrick and Briony. Not only must they deal with the advancing Qar, but with their father's ransom, the scheming Autarch of the southern continent, and the death of their elder brother. Its length may be daunting, but believe me, it's worth it.	2005-01-09

This book was reccomended to me by my mom for me to expand my reading tastes. I was maybe a little hesitant, but I began reading it, and was immediately pulled in by the compelling, quirky characters and the mind boggling plot. Each new character is equally amusing, and their names seem to depict their nature. When I first saw Uncle Pumblechook's name, I was immediately able to guess what sort of a person he was, same with Mr. Wopsle, Mr. Wemmick, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and more. The humor is subtle, but once you get the joke you'll be howling. <br />However, Dickens is certainly not an author who says little when there is an opportunity to say more; in a nutshell, his writing is quite flourid. Ten pages can be a whole lot to get through, not because it is boring, but because it is full of complex words, sentences, and paragraphs, that you'll need a little bit of rest. I felt sometimes like reading it was like an excercise seminar for my mind. But don't let these few words discourage you, it's a great read.	2004-12-17

I enjoyed the Briar King, but I didn't have high hopes for this book when I bought it, partly because it is the second book in a series and this is a common flunking point for authors, and partly because the Briar King had only been pretty good and I was afraid that it would be the only mildly good book in the series. Instead, I got to be pleasantly surprised.  First of all, the actions of the characters are much more realistic and much more likeable. In the first book, I found Anne somewhat hard to bear, but now she realizes her mistakes and developes into less of a spoiled brat and more of the mature queen that she obviously will become at some point in the series.   Then, I found the plot crazily compelling. Anne, Austra, Cazio, and z'Acatto, are on the run from the mysterious knights that assaulted her at the coven in the last book, while Neil MeqVren has been intrusted to find them and return them to Eslen. Neil was a character that I very much liked in the first book, and I hope my fellow readers did as well, so a plot twisting ride with him is more than I could ask for. Then, Aspar, Stephen, Winna, and Ehawk, a young boy from the villages the Briar King has been destroying, have been sent to slay the Briar King by the Praifec Hespero, yet soon uncover a startling secret that I never could have predicted due to the ending of the last book. Muriele is attempting to maintain political balance at Eslen while a brave young composer, Leoff Ackenzal, stands against the Church by performing shinecraft that is not evil. Also, at the end, you still do not know what the human sacrificing monks's main motive is. And by the way, who leads them?  Finally, the Keyes's fantastical imagination is irresistable. Creatures with names such as utins, basil nixes, greffyns, magical feyswords, evil witches and god-like figures, honestly, how much more is there that a fantasy fan can ask for?  In a nutshell, if you enjoyed the Briar King you shall enjoy this book even more, and awaitThe Blood Knight with painstaiking excitement.	2004-11-22

Here is an overview of all the short novels in this collection: <br />Robin Hobb:Her prior works were definately a whole lot better, but not too bad.It was mildly menotenous and pretty sad, but it had some worth. <br />George R.R. Martin: I don't know how this story compares to A Game of Thrones and the rest because I haven't read them, but I thought it was pretty mediocre. No magic or anything appears in it, and the whole plot is pretty insignificant. I liked the characters, but I didn't really care about what was going on. Yet it did not turn me away from the possibility of trying out some of Martin's books some day. <br />Orson Scott Card:Card is a science fiction writer and as far as I am concerned does not belong in this collection. I *loved* Ender's Game, but his whole Alvin the Maker series' plot doesn't really hold together. Honestly, an alternate history with folklore magic incorporated in it? How crazy is that? <br />Diana Gabaldon:Just not my type, but I know lots of other people like her, so I won't discourage anyone to read her. <br />Robert Silverberg:Pretty good, went through some important historical events in Majipoor, not quite as good as his story in the previous Legends, but still not all that bad.I encourage you to try Lord Valentine's Castle, its REALLY good. <br />Tad Williams:Interesting, but I haven't read Otherland so I couldn't really understand everything. Nevertheless worth reading. <br />Anne McCaffrey:Just like Card,McCaffrey is a science fiction author. She doesn't belong in this collection. The story wasn't spectacular either, you have to have read Pern to get what's going on. <br />Raymond E. Feist:GREAT. It was exciting,it went through important historical events in Midkemia, and it had a character you cared enough about to keep on reading. It brought back happy memories of reading Magician. <br />Elizabeth Haydon:Also really good. It got me interested in reading her other books. It was as enchanting and ominous as any fantasy story needs to be. <br />Neil Gaiman:Terrible. I hope to God that American Gods and Neverwhere are better than this story. It's utterly boring, has a pretty unappealing character, and doesn't even have a magical fantasy feel to it. Stupid. <br />Terry Brooks:Pretty good, however, you need to have read Shannara, like me, to understand everything that's going on, and the topic isn't the best thing he could have written about. It shouldn't discourage you from reading Shannara, because it really is a GREAT series. Yet overall pretty good.	2004-10-17

They  virtually say the same thing over and over again, it will be the next Tolkien, if Harry Potter has fed your thirst for fantasy, try this, making unworthy comparisons that only a ridiculously gullible person would believe. Now I did not believe that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell would live up to its hype, yet I bought it all the same. I was dumbfounded. <br />To start out with, it's every bit as complete as Lord of the Rings, Dune, and Harry Potter, creating a convincing history of magic and magicians that's almost believeable. In every chapter there's at least 3 footnotes elaborating on fairies, various magicians, magical books, and the like, some betraying the term \\"footnote\\" by being several pages long. But they do not get tedious. <br />Also, the characters are wonderously detailed, having they're own funny, shocking, even haunting personalities, with names that depict the nature of the character just like in Dickens. The thing is, neither Jonathan Strange or Mr. Norrell are your ideal appealing characters. The side characters, such as Stephen Black,Childermass, and John Segundus, would be your ideal main characters. Yet it is their flaws that somehow makes them so likeable. <br />As well as funny and enthralling, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is also utterly haunting. The fairies and their somewhat ambitious acts chilled me, and whenever the gentleman with thistledown hair took the stage I muttered \\"Oh please no.\\" <br />As for the plot, too much must not be given away, but essentially, Mr. Norrell, the only practical magician in England for centuries, emerges from hiding and proceeds to make all sorts of wonders happen, and is soon joined by Jonathan Strange. Yet signs of the greatest mideval magician of all time's return, The Raven King, have found their way into into the story, while Stephen Black, an African servant, is held in thrall by a fairy. <br />Do not hesitate to buy it, it may be intimidatingly long, but I promise you, you won't want it to end.	2004-10-10

Are you still waiting on your favorite author to release his/her new book? Have you been finding very little to read? Then I suggest you read this book, it moves fast, is detailed in the language, races, and history,has hateable villains and fairly likeable characters. Most of all, the plot is still following the good old Tolkien tradition, but twists the way things happen in it, kind of like Robert Stanek. Honestly, with a name like The Briar King, where can you go wrong?<BR>I liked Neil MeqVren the best out of all the characters, his actions were easily understanded. I also liked Aspar White and Stephen Darige, but not half as much as Neil.<BR>Like Stanek and George R.R. Martin, it takes on multiple view points: Princess Anne Dare and her maid Austra, who have been sent away to train as assassin's, due to current court intrigue, Aspar White, the king's holter, who is informed of the awakening of the Briar King, Stephen Darige, a young monk who meets up with him, Neil MeqVren, a knight in service of the queen, and, though he comes in later, Cazio, a roguish swordsman of Vitellio. It occaisonally goes to the king and queen, but these are the main ones. Like all multiple viewpoint books, several things are going on at once, Anne and Austra are sent away to train as assassins while Crotheny is fighting a war with Saltmark, and, maybe even Hansa.  Aspar White has been warned by the mysterious Sefry people that the legendary Briar King is awakening, yet he does not believe them, for he thinks them liars. And Cazio, well, he comes in later so I don't want to spoil the surprise.<br />Overall, it's a pretty good book. Buy it.	2004-05-11

First of all, anyone who compares this book to Tolkien clearly has not read it. Sure, it has some Tolkienesque elements in them, but it seems more compareable to something like King Arthur, or the like. But it really is extremely original, and definately deserves what it's gotten.<BR>First of all, the characters are amazing. Each has some interesting kind of quirk, and a specific purpose. They aren't just dashed into the book to fill up more pages. They can be hateable, loveable, or utterly mysterious.<BR>Also, the training of Fitz in the art of an assassin is amazingly interesting. What he learns, his responses, his missions.<BR>Then, he does magic as well as Terry Brooks. It has the same effect, though not used in the same way.<BR>Best of all, at the end, you're left wondering what will happen next, how the Elderlings will come in, if he'll meet Molly again, etc.<BR>Anyway, it's one darn good book, so I definately suggest you read it.	2004-02-01

Both Andre Norton *and* Mercedes Lackey can write better than this, both alone and with other authors. In the beginning, I was thinking: &quot; I forgot how good these books were&quot; and at the end I was thinking:&quot;God, why did I pick this up?&quot; The truth is, it's not terrible, it was kinda good, but the authors were trying too hard. For instance, that whole system of how to keep people alive in a gladiatoral ceremony, that was just ridiculous.Also, they waited too long to have Lorryn and Shana fall madly in love. That could have happened very easily in Elvenblood. And if there was so much detail(well, not a lot, but still quite a bit) on the Iron People preparing for war, why didn't they ride into battle at the end? They could have just wrapped this series up in this book, but no, they are just going to amble on about the discovery of where the elves came from blah blah blah. Kyrtian was a likeable character, but they can't be introducing new characters at this point in the series. They need to have the halfbloods rebel and have everything end like a regular fantasy series.<BR>Also, since so many of the elvenlords are perfectly nice, it's quite hard to believe that they are evil. If so many grin at Kyrtian's clever fighting strategies, then why should he switch sides? If only some elvenlords are bad, then why should the halfbloods rebel in the first place? It just doesn't make sense.<BR>Okay, you've got the point, so if you want good Norton and good Lackey, try Owlflight(Lackey) and Wind in the Stone, and the Hands of Lyr(Norton). This series does have a kind of interesting concept, but no big promise.	2003-12-28

Before I read this book, I had already had an encounter with Feist in Krondor:the Betrayal, and had concluded never to try his books again, no matter how well thought of they were. Then I decided to give him another chance with this book, and boy was it good. Every fantasy creature desirable, goblins, dwarves, elves, gnomes, giants,trolls, wraiths, and dragons.It's fast moving, with likeable characters, and a well-thought-out plot(for the time it was written, at least).<br />Pug of Crydee dreams of being a soldier, but when he is chosen to be the apprentice of Kulgan the Magician he is quite surprised. And when he tries simple spells like levatating, and lifting himself off the ground, he cannot do it, yet Kulgan is certain that he has the magical talent, and Pug proves this when he saves the Princess Carline from two trolls. He enjoys romance with Carline, and training in magic for several months, until he finds a shipwreck with his friend Tomas on the shore. With this evidence Kulgan and a priest prove that their will be a raid on Midkemia from an alien people(he and a priest probe into the man's mind, and question him of his people, who are making the raid). Pug, Tomas, Kulgan, and many more embark on a journey to warn Midkemia, of this raid.<br />So why four stars instead of five? Well, near the end, their is so much action I got bored.

I could not put it down.It was complex,magical,and at many points exciting.Le Guin developed and amazing culture ,yet she did not go too far ,like other authors (David Eddings). I adored how Le Guin put an anti-racist thing in,very slyly.The Kargs ,had pale skin,and a good deal of Earthsea didn't(the Kargs are \\"evil\\").This book made simple classes of wizardry ,which in most books would be amazingly boring,was extremely interesting.Most of the boring parts were when the character was bored,not when you for some reason were supposed to be interested. I have to say ,besides Ged,my favorite character was the otak.So cute ,yet so loyal.Le Guin can make little things wonderful.

I was extremely dissapointed by the first book in this series.It had WAY too much action.But Winter Night and Spring Dawning were interesting ,exciting but not too exciting ,and really great .Fantasy creatures from A toZ ,great characters(my favorite being Flint Fireforge)and a good plot.I have to admit that it got extremely sketchy at some points.Like the dream ,that was very random and uncalled for.	2003-04-01

Before this review begins I would like to warn readers that something very strange happens in the beginning.Keep on reading ,eventually you figure that he wasn't in his right mind when he did that.<BR>                 Donaldson is extremely detailed,he adds legengs,languages(I love it when authors make a language),he has great character detail,and includes a vast profusion of new creatures.Thomas Covenant is such a good character.I wanted to yell at him when he made mistakes.The Land is an unforgetable place,particularly the Plains of Ra.<BR>                        Thomas Covenant has a very unhappy life in the beginning.He has just gotten leprosy,and his wife has divorced with him due to that fact.But as soon as he is hit by a police car he is transported to a completely different world.The inhabitants of the Land believe him to be their long lost hero Berek Halfhand,wielder of the White Gold.Covenant,a Giant named Saltheart Foamfollower,and a good deal of others embark on a quest to retrieve the Staff of Law from the Cavewight ,Drool,servant of Lord Foul.	2003-03-20

After reading Krondor the Betrayal ,I was certain that all of Feist's work was that poorly written.As soon as I began this ,I realized that I was wrong.The only action he put in was legitimate,there was not at all to much of it ,with the exception of the end.If there was such a rating as 4 and 1/2 ,I would have rated it that ,for the end is slightly monotenous on the action side.But five stars is the closest.<BR>                 Feist almost has as much magic detail as Terry Brooks ,and great cultural developement .He includes all the creatures a fantasy-attic can hope for:elves,dwarves,dragons,goblins,trolls,everything I could ask for.<BR>                Pug is a young boy in the city of Crydee.On Choosing Day,he is surprised to be chosen by Kulgan,the Magician for an apprentice.Though he has made a couple magical achievments,Pug is not at ease with magic and its ways.But as soon as there is evidence of invaders from across the sea,Pug,Kulgan,and some others must embark on a quest to warn the Kingdom of invasion.<BR>P.S.Any Jordan fan is sure to like Feist's characters.	2003-03-19

This is just as good as Scions.It has just as much character detail,and just as good a plot .It even has detail on the Northland that Brooks has not revealed yet.Urdas,Kodens,Uhl Belk,all sorts of things Brooks has not previously put in.A nice little love story put in too,but not as vivid as the evil Stackpole's work.It was nice to know that the King of the Silver River has a daughter.It began slow ,but I still loved it .<BR>                     The Stone King Uhl Belk has stolen the Black Elfstone,which is the only thing that Walker Boh can bring back Paranor and the Druids with .Accompenied by Quickening ,Daughter of the King of the Silver River(one of my favorite characters)Morgan Leah,the tracker Horner Dees,and the assassin Pe Ell ,(who darkly  plans to murder Quickening)he sets out throught the Northland to retrieve it.<BR>                    I was in to this book so much that I wanted to call out to the characters when they made mistakes.I reccomend Brooks' new series to any Brooks fan!	2003-03-07

I expected that Brooks' new series not to be as good .I expected it to get repetiteve.I was wrong .It is not at all repetetive ,in fact ,Brooks added some political detail that he lacked in the other books,but it isn't pointless political<BR> detail.Brooks still has his superb detail in magic ,which is one of the reasons that he is one of my favorite authors.It also was perfectly legitimate to write it.Anyone might wonder what life is like in the Four Lands after all the Druids are gone .This is the plot:The Four Lands have drastically changed since the death of Allanon.The Elves have vanished and Callahorn,The Dwarves ,and the Southland are in the hands of the Federation,where magic is strictly illegal.Par Ohmsford still has the power of the Wishsong ,causing himself to be pursued    by Seekers (Federation police).While he flees,he stumbles upon Cogline ,a once Druid.Cogline tells him that he ,his cousin Wren,and his uncle Walker Boh are needed by the shade of Allanon.Par finds Walker and they meet Wren at the Hadeshorn.Allanon tells each of them to do one thing :Par to recover the Sword of Shannara ,Walker to bring back the  Druids and the keep of Paranor ,and Wren to find the vanished Elves .<BR>                  This book is about Par,his brother Coll,Morgan Leah,Steff and Teel  the Dwarves,and a couple others on there search for the Sword of Shannara.P.S.The next one is about Walker etc.	2003-03-02

I must say that I disagree with the last review.Wishsong is better than Elfstones.In Elfstones,the \\"bad guyes\\"were easy as pie .In Wishsong,Brooks resumes the theme of winning by a thread ,translation:the evil peoples are hard.Brin is one of my favorite characters in the whole series so far ,next to Risca ,Foraker,Hendel,Tay ,Raybur and a good deal of other people.It's just so easy to understand her feelings and her thoughts.Anyway ,here is the plot :Brin and Jair Ohmsford ,like most Ohmsfords live in Shady Vale and they bare the power of the wishsong:Wish for it ,sing for it ,and it's your's.Their pleasant lives are disturbed when Allanon the Druid comes to them in need of Brin's wishsong ,for the evil Ildatch book has unleashed the Mord Wraiths upon the Four Lands.Brin must travel with Allanon to the Maelmord,where the Ildatch is kept ,and destroy it with the wishsong .Jair however is making a quest towards Heaven's Well to heal the land that the Wraiths have poisoned.	2003-03-01

This is truly Weis and Hickman's greatest achievment .It is even better than Dragonlance ,and that is saying something.There is much more intrigue ,much more uncertanity ,much more character description.I was also pleased by there extensive detail in the dwarves ,or Gegs .Barely any authors put that much detail in dwarves ,they usually stick to the elves.But anyway ,here is the plot :The world has been sundered into four realms ,sky ,stone ,fire and water .On Arianus ,Sky realm ,Three things are happening at once :Hugh the assasin is hired against his will to kill a prince .Sinistrad the wizard is planning to conquer Arianus .Limbeck the dwarf has challenged the beliefs of his people and has decided to lead them in regellion against the \\"Welves \\".Any fantasy fan should read this ,and continue the series .I began the second book several days ago and it's even better .	2003-01-25
