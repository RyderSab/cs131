His writing progessivly got worse with each book, and he showed that after he broke from mimicing jordan he really didnt have much to write about... I thought to myself however, Maybe he regained his old story, I was close to picking up the book but thanks to these reviews i know sometimes you just have to let the dead stay dead....	2005-01-26

No, nothing about the charecters that were and still are great.. No, I'd ask him why I should even bother to continue to read this saga. maybe, Just maybe, if he took the last 200 pages of POd and the last 200 pages of WH, and nothing at all from this latest book, then maybe he would have came up with a book worthy of my money and more importantly time. The sad truth is we'll still buy the hard covers and make this clown more millions... I wonder if he has even read what he's been putting out... truly a sad case for what started off so brilliantly	2003-02-23

If you liked Lord of the Barnyard then you will love this as well, you will also be let down with how short it is.<BR>  Fortunately for Egolf fans that is the only flaw I really see in this book, I partially expected a sophomore slump, especially with the long wait for this release. But no, it held all the wit and humor that Barnyard held.<BR>  With such mediocrity in lit now a days, I dearly hope egolf continues to write, and is right now hard at work for a third novel... I just hope it doesn't take 4 years for his next one.	2002-09-09

Mooney's writing style I think is excillant, and he does an okay job with his charecter devolpment, but the saving grace of this book, is the conclusion wasnt to bad, it was good even. if mooney can get a little bit more original with his plot lines, he will have an excillant career.	2001-02-07

On its own i might give it a 4 star, But compared to the other moore books its just not as good. I thought he took a few short cuts with his charecter devolpment, which was supurb in the proir books. I also dont feel it was quite as funny as the others, but over all it wasnt to bad, anything that can get off on a tanker truck is bound to be a decient read. looking foward to moores next!!!	2000-11-02

Moore is a brillant writer and his skills with charecter devolpment are amazing. Ever sense reading Love nun I have not been able to put Moore down. Coyote Blue is just as good as the rest, if Not better. I cant compare it to BS fiends cause I have'nt read that yet, But it is right up there with the rest of moores witty novels. Over all Essisment, If you like good charecters, a good plot, and a good laugh, Moore is your man.	2000-10-21

But same ole song and dance	Goodkind has shown me one positive and many negative things in this novel. The positive is that he still has the potentiel to write like he did in WFR. I found this novel to be similiar in style where the others have differed. This book is by far the best sense WFR, but thats only cause the others have been that bad. Goodkind doesnt seem to know where he is going with this saga, either that or he has completly sold out to corperate publishing and is milking this Sword of truth for all he can. On a brighter side, even though the plot had absolutly 0!! progression, this book was tons better then the last few and will keep me reading the series. hopefully Goodkind will be patient with this next book and make it good.	2000-10-14

I have never seen any turn a world into so much chaos so gracefully and yes even flawlessly. With a clash of kings martin takes off right where Game of thrones left us with intensitiy and a quite strong emotional attatchment with his charecters.

Tolkien had originality, but sense then nothing has really compared to his work. But Martin comes along and arguebally blows tolkiens work out of the water.  Martin is a master at charecter devolpment, He has introduced us to charecters that will be remembered by its readers for a very very long time to come. Martin uses a sertain grace with his writing, its as if he takes his time with every little detail that happens to his charecters. Out of the 3 books that are currently out, this book is by far the best so far.  once you start you will not be able to put it down, and I almost would recamend not starting, for when you do you will be addicted to Martin and a song of ice and fire for life.	2000-10-12

Moore is a very funny writer and extreamly original. I read this book not expecting it to be as good as love nun, sure enough it was better. Moore while being funny weaves a very interesting story, His charecter devolpment for such a short book is also extreamly talented.

I only have 2 main problems. one his writing style which Is no biggie, I could over look that, But he has almost NO charecter devolpment, Those two flaws made me yawn and yearn for the ending of the book. However this is his debut novel, and the plot was good enough so with the proper evolution of his writing skills he could devolp into a decient writer. I strongly suggest waiting for the paper back or going to the library for this one.	2000-09-26
