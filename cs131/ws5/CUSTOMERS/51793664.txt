US	51793664	R1FCCL6AN0L28J	B00000IODY	74893914	Syphon Filter	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Simply Fun	This game is fun for the exact opposite reason that Metal Gear Solid is fun.  In this game stealth isn't of much importance, while quickly killing all the bad guys on the screen is important.  Like most action games this one is staged out into many different missions, which usually have five or six objectives in order throughout the level. My personal favorite aspect of this game is the target system which locks on to the enemy of your choice making the game easier in a crowded room of enemies.  Syphon Filter is one great pure action game.	2001-08-01

The child murders cause  him to question God although he is a lapsed Catholic and also cause him to  slip in his alcohol recovery program.

Alive is an excellantly written account of their ordeal in the Andes, and  their survival through ingenious ideas and the eating of their dead  friends' human flesh. Meanwhile, Alive also covers the search party  attempts made by the members of the families of the boys trapped in the  Andes.  This book also gives a good account of most of the boys  personalities and their will to survive.  The most compelling thing about  this book is that they never gave up there belief in that they could  survive through their belief in god.  In the end two members of the group  climb a mountain and hike for days to reach civilization and save the  remaining 14 still living in the busted plane.  This book is truly a great  account of the determination for humans to survive at all costs.  I would  reccommend this book to anyone who would like to read a true and  emotionally gripping story.  Alive is one of the best things I've read in a  long time.	2000-08-05

The race is being won by the attorney general until innuendo  hints that Attorney General Allison Leahy is guilty of adultery.  Her  popularity slides even more as sympathy rises for General Howe, her  opponent, whose granddaughter is abducted as the election draws near.  Is  this abduction related to the  unsolved abduction of Ms. Leahy's adopted  daughter eight years previously?  The mysteries are solved but the ending  is abrupt after a long build up.  Halfway through the novel, I determined  who the villain was, but otherwise it was a good, but predictable, read.	2000-08-03

For the most part most of the information about Miles' life has been covered in  other books, and is covered especially well in his own autobiography.  The  author of this book does know a lot about the music of Miles Davis, which  takes center stage in his musical analysis of each album.  The appendixes  of this book are very well done, I especially enjoy the appendix that has  highly detailed information on each album that Miles has played on.  For  musicians there is an appendix which gives examples in musical notation of  Miles Davis' solos. Another element that helps this book is the vast amount  of quotes from people that knew Miles personally such as his musicians and  friends.   All in all, this biography gives a good account of Miles' life  and is a great source for information on his music.  Read Miles Davis' own  autobiography first, then pick up this book.	2000-08-02

He talks openly about which  guys did heroin, and who he had aruguments with and much, much more.  What  is even better is that Miles speaks candidly about his own problems in  life, he covers his coke addiction (which was one of the reasons he retired  for about 6 years), his heroin addiction, his sex life, ect.  Miles also  openly displays his opinions about everything, reading this book makes me  feel like I've had a deep conversation with Miles.  His writing is vulgar  (this book has about a million cuss words), which adds to the feeling that  he's telling his life story naturally without any interference from his  editor.  In this autobiography Miles Davis' entire life is covered in a  well detailed fashion, with many great stories thrown in for entertainment.  This is the best autobiography I've read, and I throughly recommend it to  all Miles Davis fans.	2000-07-18

I had to read this book for school, usually I hate the books I have to read for school, but in the case of Brave New World I was very pleasently surprised.  Brave New World is an awesome book that was written about 70  years ago, but is still set in the very distant future and still has an  effective message today.  This book is set in a utopian future where the  entire planet is one nation and almsot everyone is happy.  The people are  kept happy by having a view of sex as something commonplace and with many  people; they are also kept happy by a halucionogenic drug that everyone  takes called soma.  The book portrays that author's views on almost every  aspect of society (religion, sex, science, ect.) and is the sort of book  that can have many different interpretations.  Brave New World is the kind  of book that once you read the first chapter you want to keep reading just  to see what happens next.  So far, this is one of my favorite books, and I  would definately recommend it to almost everyone.	2000-07-16

First off, the book is very stylishly put together and has a professional feel.  The professional feel is further  seen in the well done explaination on how to stock your bar, and how to mix  good drinks.  The final great thing about this book is the massive amount  of drinks that it contains.  The one poor thing about the Bartender's Bible  is that the drinks are organized by main ingredient, instead of  alphabetical, this causes a slower time when looking up drinks.  All in  all, this is a pretty good drink mixing guide, but I'm sure you can find  better.	2000-07-12

The descriptions of the beers are nice, but short and to the point. Its nice that the beers are  indexed by location and alphabetical order so as to make it easy to find  out what kind of beer there is when you travel.  Other information given  about each beer such as where and in what style it was brewed; information  is also given on what food would go best with the beer.  In the front of  the book the styles of beer are described and the rating system is  explained.  A very nice plus to this book is that in the back each type of  beer (lager,stout, ect.) has a list of what is best for that type. Another  cool thing is that the book has many beer facts throughout. The only  downside is that on the rating system not many beers score better than a 4  (the scale goes 0-5) suggesting that the scale might need to be changed.   For suggestions and descriptions on beer that are nicely indexed I would  select this book.	2000-07-12

The information is based mostly on facts, and doesn't offer enough emotional insight from Carlos and his  other band members.  This book also didn't have enough about Carlos  Santana's spiritual and political views.  Basically, this book does an  amazing job at covering the chronology of the band,information about each  album, and information about the different guys who played with the band at  one time or another.  Look mainly to this book for straight facts and an  excellant biography of Carlos' early life and the beginning of the first  Santana band.  Don't be surprised if there isn't much emotional insight or  highly detailed information about the Santana band past 1974.  The only  thing better than this book would be if Carlos wrote his own biography.	2000-07-06
