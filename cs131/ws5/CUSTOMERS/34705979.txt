Anyway, with these disclaimers I'll push on.<br /><br />Great stuff - Chandler really has his own voice, mood and characters. Indeed, he's quite self-conscious in this book, having Anne Riordan remonstrate with Marlowe about how he *should* have run and concluded his investigation in a more traditional and elegant fashion:<br />\\"You ought to have given a dinner party ... and you at the head of the long table telling all about it, little by little, with your charming light smile and a phony English accent..\\"<br />Marlowe responds for Chandler, \\"It's not that kind of story. It's not lithe and clever. It's just dark and full of blood.\\"<br />Interesting that Chandler felt he had to justify his deliberate departure from the classic mannered English detective story - or was he just enjoying highlighting the contrast?<br /><br />And it's not *just* dark and full of blood: there's flirting, camaraderie, humour, honour, and even a romantic ending. Still, along the way Marlowe takes a hell of a beating given his somewhat inexplicable method - which involves identifying particularly dangerous individuals and locations and just walking in without preparation, protection or backup. If you somehow manage to still be breathing after they've pounded you for a while, you've got some more clues to your case. And you even get the (nice) girl on your own terms:<br /> `You're so marvellous,' she said, `So brave, so determined, and you work for so little money. Everybody beats you over the head and chokes you and smacks your jaw and fills you with morphine, but you just keep right on hitting between tackle and end until they're all worn out. What makes you so wonderful?<br /> `Go on,' I growled, `Spill it.'<br /> Anne Riordan said thoughtfully: `I'd like to be kissed, damn you!'<br />So who's reviewing this book - me or Chandler?<br /><br />Marlowe is a pretty cool pro, but anything but a schemer. He throws himself in the ring and improvises. He blurs the lines, liking some of the bad guys a bit much, being rough and coarse - but then bugging the good guys by showing he's read a bit and can show more chivalry than they do. And just what was going on with `Mrs Grayle' and the midnight assignation which could have ended very differently:<br />`I bet it's fun to be played by handsome blondes,' Anne Riordan said. `Even if there is a little risk. As, I suppose, there usually is.'<br />I didn't say anything.<br /><br />He's quite a contrast with the cold, aloof (but still troubled) Sherlock Holmes. If getting involved might cloud his judgement a bit, hey, what the hell...<br /><br />Chandler has a knack for making his characters shine - Marlowe is actually a bit of a soft touch, he can empathise, and from his perspective we find things to draw us to them the way he is. An odd thing in his in other ways very bleak, rough world.- me or Chandler?     Marlowe is a pretty cool pro, but anything but a schemer. He throws himself in the ring and improvises.

The formula of a mildly quirky detective has become such a popular one - how many TV shows work this way? - and if you're after another workable episode, sure.<br /><br />I was more giving it a go having only read one other of his books: his poignant, dark and striking The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. George Smiley is a different bird entirely - not trying to soar or kick, just to entertain. Somehow I didn't find Smiley as engaging as I suspect I was supposed to, so I could take or leave it.	2005-09-26

Smith hands us some quirky and charming company in an exotic location, although the place is hardly romanticised. I thought he may have pushed the feel-good thing a bit too far with the positively saintly Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni and the near perfect orphan/daughter, but somehow he got away with it - c'mon, why not let your readers enjoy a happy ending now and then. I haven't spent any time in Africa to know, but the settings and disarmingly (to Westerners) open dialogue felt authentic. Despite some ugly content in a continent that's suffered more than its share of poverty, disease and brutality, the book still manages to be gentle and affectionate. This is part of its apologetic purpose: if you think AIDS and corruption is all there is to Africa, think again.<br /><br />In terms of solving a crime, Mma Ramotswe leans more on her virtually supernatural empathetic skills rather than brilliant deduction or wild car chases: she can tell by glancing at a ten year old newspaper clipping who must be guilty by the look in his eyes, and just needs to talk to a suspect to instantly know whether or not he's lying. But the pace of the investigation, with enjoyable diversions along the way, is well measured, and strikes a nice balance with the greater strength of the character's personal lives and interactions.<br /><br />A nice way to spend an hour or two.	2005-09-26

Ideally you'd probably sit down with it like a uni text and take notes/write responses on the way through.<br /><br />However I didn't read it that way, rather I just chipped away here and there, and finished it a while ago, so forgive me when I blur things a bit.<br /><br />A positive of this book (typically Yancey and probably a major reason for his popularity) is the relative honesty. Unlike so many other Christian books he doesn't create absurd straw men to attack, or speak from the perspective of a saintly guru. To his credit, in painting his picture of someone `disappointed' with God he gives `Richard' time, sympathy and respect - it's not the more usual deal of setting someone up for a fall, where lack of faith is simply a character defect. The conversations don't feel contrived. The issue he sets up feels authentic: at least it feels like we're actually talking about the same thing, he's understood the question.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is then an attempt to offer answers. Not (generally) in a, \\"C'mon stupid, this is so obvious,\\" tone, but more personal, \\"How about this? Have you thought about it this way? Something I was thinking about the other day was...\\". That being said, while this book avoids the contempt for non-Christians that undermines so much Christian literature, it's still going to be rough going for anyone who doesn't accept some pretty basic mainstream Christian assertions, particularly that of the authority of scripture. Its more aimed at Christians with some doubts, not condemning them, but throwing in some potentially encouraging ideas.<br /><br />Why, I suspect, it didn't deliver me into a land of conviction (as was the hope of those who recommended it to me) was to do with the sheer volume of mental contortions offered (or, perhaps, simply a character defect on my part). Somewhere along the way I felt too much like I was in one of my own way too wordy missives - I've written letters to people that have got so convoluted in explanations that they lost impact, they felt too much like contrived mental exercises rather than penetrating analysis or heartfelt conviction. Something starts feeling a bit suspect if it takes just so much, `hey, just stay with me on this one, I know it's a bit out there and it's already run a few pages, but...\\".<br /><br />There's also the irony that at times Yancey's sincerely offered ladders to faith actually require just as much faith as you're hopefully being led towards: why is it easier to believe that we're looking `at' the beam when we should be looking `along' it to deal with contradictions? Lewis, as ever, has wonderful metaphors, but just because something has poetic impact doesn't necessarily make it easier to believe. I suppose the trick is saying, \\"Look, you say the idea of a loving and powerful God is impossible to reconcile with suffering, but I'll give you an example of being able to look at the same thing in two entirely different ways.\\" Maybe the elegance this argument can push some over the line, but I felt like it was no easier (or harder) to buy this than to just go with the hardly unjustifiable usual, \\"Who are you, man, to think you can judge God?!\\"fect on my part).

Is it because, reading it after these, I wasn't as surprised by the originality of the ideas? There is still some great stuff here, with Fal `Ngeestra's musings, the Predator/Warhammer 40 000 ultra-marine Idiran race, potently exotic locations, and some typically striking action. The first few chapters are crackers - almost humorously packed: Horza barely has time to draw breath as he's frantically thrown between frying pan and fire. The initial ironically sympathetic interactions between him and his culture nemesis promise much. Then we step back in time for some philosophy and a little more exploration of the fascinating ultimate humanist utopia of the culture through the eyes of a gifted teenager off on an island paradise. All the ingredients are here (including Banks' undeniably impressive wide historical setting) and I was relishing the prospect of the rest of the book - but by Vavatch he was losing me, and I should have followed my initial temptation to bail after the ridiculous carnage of the escape from The Ends of Invention: the whole Schar's World narrative was laboured and increasingly silly.<br /><br />Sure, I can see that there's something insightful in having such a `morally ambiguous hero' - many uglier civilian deaths have been caused by sincere soldiers - but I just couldn't get by the stupidity of it all. C'mon, Horza has been sold to us as an elite spy/assassin: what on earth was he doing going back to the one ship the culture could trace him to when there are literally a million others leaving the orbital? Sure it was a wild ride off the GSV, but a really unnecessary one by a supposedly intelligent agent. And speaking of supposedly intelligent and resourceful agents, what does Balveda actually do from the moment she's abducted? There are myriad moments when Horza is distracted or preoccupied - or in disarray! - but Balveda is a docile lamb the whole time. Why? And why on earth did they keep Xoxarle alive - after this terrifying monster constantly tried to maim or kill them? The motive of saving him for something worse than death just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Maybe Banks is doing something deliberate here - presenting something of the madness of warfare that sees desperate sacrifices made for lost causes or intelligence mistakes - but it just felt really inconsistent to me.<br /><br />So, sure, if this was the first Culture book I'd read maybe the dazzling scale, skilful action and intriguing history/philosophy would have overcome the irritation of the last third of the book - but it's not, so I find it hard to recommend it without some serious pruning. Too much of it's just cold, dark and senseless.veda is a docile lamb the whole time. Why?

US	34705979	R1ZMS7OL5UGDCO	0140367462	811026525	The Princess and the Goblin (Puffin Classics)	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Inspiring or elitist? Or both?	Before we get started I should offer my alternative reading first: in this fairy tale a good hearted peasant boy rescues a princess from evil goblins, thereby winning her heart and the respect of her father the king.<br /><br />Enough said? But the more I think about this book, the more there is to think about. The values are just so different to just about anything else I've read and don't have a neat category waiting. The conventions are turned around - did I mention that the princess also rescues the peasant boy? I can't say I enjoyed it as much as I did reading the sequel The Princess and Curdie (out of order), but I'm not sure if that reflects higher expectations or me just being in a different mental space rather than a difference in quality.<br /><br />Macdonald encourages his target audience of young girls and boys to think of themselves as princesses and princes, and to act accordingly. His didactic intention is quite unapologetically overt, as in his not infrequent prods along the lines of: \\"Irene knew to be polite - not like some princesses I can think of.\\" He's really run with that childish statistical impossibility - that just about every individual pre/early teen (cf. Adrian Mole) feels that they are destined for greater things than everyone else. Thus it's not a problem that there are only an elect few in the kingdom who have royal character: Macdonald's intended audience will generally assume they're with that specialised minority.<br /><br />Or is that my culture speaking - where children are raised on unrealistic dreams that they'll have to grieve the loss of upon reaching maturity? Were 19th century kids raised on more pedestrian expectations? However there's still a sense of the magic of childhood in Kipling - although Macdonald seems to feel it's possible to maintain that magic. Perhaps it's partly that Macdonald was writing for a more wealthy element within his society (that element who, at very least, were literate) who already had an idea of their class as an elite.<br /><br />Anyway... in this world most are blind, or at best short-sighted. The key to supernatural vision comes through character and faith - although it also seems to be genetic: the princess really is royal, despite having no input from mother and hardly ever seeing her noble father. She rises above her shallow-natured nurse to deserved imperious rule.<br /><br />It's all about integrity, and it seems many have forgotten how to be pure, or were never taught. You can see why Lewis acknowledged MacDonald as his master - he constantly throws out surprising pictures of what it means to be innocent, and how this is actually strength, while wickedness or selfishness can't even apprehend this as anything but simple-mindedness or weakness. I think I enjoyed Lewis' depiction of this with unfallen Eve in Voyage to Venus (Perelandra) more, but there's an acknowledged debt.<br /><br />I'm still unsure whether this really does synchronise with what Jesus taught and stood for. It's definitely a possible reading of the kingdom of God - which is only for a few. Only a few are able - or will choose - to be morally courageous. Consistently making these choices makes you `royal' in the mythical sense - you escape the mire of petty self-advancement/protection and live in the fullness of righteousness that rightly places you above your subjects. It's also royal in the biblical sense: we know who your father really is by how you live. Curdie has always been prepared to lose his life, and in so doing, as Jesus says, gains it: he doesn't even think about it that much, you just do what is right, and if death ensues, that's a relatively minor consequence compared with the alternative of not doing right. Thus, MacDonald illustrates, he gains a wholeness of being that, for example, the timid nurse can't even imagine. Jesus called people out of `the world' into a spiritual awareness that transcended it - the kingdom that is `within you'. There's also an attempt to paint a world where benign cosmic forces can step in at any time to bring supernatural rescue - but often inexplicably don't, and good people must often use their own diligence, courage and skill to fight alone - this being the way many Christians interpret their experience in this world.<br /><br />Why, then, am I still uncomfortable? I suppose there's just such danger in this arrogance. Curdie and the Princess don't even think about the fact that their conviction of what is right might mean dismissing the opinions of ninety percent of the people they meet. Perhaps some of my discomfort rises from having some Christians blithely dismiss the actions and thoughts of stacks of people they don't begin to understand (or even try to). But does such ignorant misjudgement necessarily justify the contemporary cant of unwillingness to judge anything (cant as at heart pluralism is highly intolerant)? But that's what MacDonald glories in - most people are compromised, and he emphatically urges his readers to keep to the higher vision. To not be motivated by what drives just about everyone.<br /><br />But some would say, \\"Hang on George, I feel like you're saying just about everybody's got it wrong except you.\\" And he might reply, \\"You're right, I am.\\" Although rather than confrontationally pointing at others and saying, `You're wicked', MacDonald paints a picture of holiness and says, \\"Look at that - that's goodness.\\" It's up to his readers to draw uncomfortable conclusions - or, rather, be inspired to step out of the narrow selfish bounds of convention that surround them.<br /><br />Curdie is still, however, an earthly hero: he defeats rather than loves his enemies. MacDonald mixes his love of fairy tales with that of the New Testament. We've got nascent romance alongside supernatural endorsement of goodness. And what do we do with the fey/enigmatic goddess/great-great-grandma? Macdonald's biographers point to his veneration of his step-mother, and for a patriarchal time his books have some unusually powerful women hard to fit into mainstream doctrine.<br /><br />I suspect MacDonald wouldn't have had any problem with that.so an attempt to paint a world where benign cosmic forces can step in at any time to bring supernatural rescue - but often inexplicably don't, and good people must often use their own diligence, courage and skill to fight alone - this being the way many Christians interpret their experience in this world.  <br /> <br />Why, then, am I still uncomfortable?

And there are some extraordinary pictures in there - while much of the period of history they're looking at (from November 1528 with a some shipwrecked Spaniards washing ashore on Galveston Island to the early 1900s) was pre-camera, much of it was post. Moreover there are maps, paintings and photos of relatively untouched landscape to illustrate earlier times.<br /><br />That being said, there's also plenty of text. And being that they've consciously chosen to largely illustrate the time by retelling the stories of extraordinary and/or typical individuals of the times, there are many engaging and fascinating stories. C'mon, the whole interaction between European settlers and the native Americans is chock full of tragedy, adventure and colour - you'd have to work hard to make this sort of content boring (although it's been done).  It's a very palatable way of reading history, not getting bogged down in statistics or alternate interpretations. Of course in their selection of material you're definitely getting only one version of events, and the bias, while generally subtle, is unavoidable. But, hey, given that I hardly had any version before, this gave me a lot more of an idea than I had.<br /><br />You have to suffer the odd overblown essay thrown in here and there, where guest writers try to outdo each other for sentimentality and bogus psuedo-spiritual flapdoodle about (FX: turn the reverb right up) `The West'. At least it's not quite as silly as the religious fervour some attach to Baseball as some sort of sacred ritual - but it is still silly. Sure, the West is an amazing place, it's more than just some rocks and sand - we get it. You going on in with some gushy mysticism really just cheapens it - let it speak for itself.<br /><br />Well, that's what I reckon anyway.

That being said, after reading just a sample of the so far over 700 amazon.com reviews - generally by Americans who completely trash the book - I have to get off my high horse and acknowledge (with some relief) that Tom clearly isn't speaking for most of his compatriots.<br /><br />In terms of craft, Clancy offers the pleasure of justice - baddies get theirs. And if he was writing stuff like this as pure fantasy - perhaps set in another time and galaxy and hardly requiring an `any similarity' disclaimer - it wouldn't be anything worse than a below average thriller. Sure, sure, I've picked up that it's a work of fiction, but the dustcover shouts out the appeal as, \\"chillingly plausible\\", and \\"a good and timely [plot].\\" In fact Clancy is writing deliberately to confirm ignorant prejudice in the same vein as those who created WW1 posters that presented all Germans as slavering beasts keen on raping Belgian nuns between courses of eating babies (a difference being that at least the creators of the posters weren't taken in by the absurdity of their own propaganda). Clancy's ideal Americans are shallow enough, but his appallingly demonised dreams of the enemy make this book really offensive.<br /><br />Isn't it good to have Clancy confirm for us that all Arab terrorists are sexual perverts. No, really - they have loads of cash from oil money and they blow it on prostitutes, alcohol, pornography and rape fantasies in internet chat rooms (not like American soldiers of course - they can all get laid because they're so hard and cool, and would never drink excessively, or resort to prostitutes or pornography). They might *seem* to be devout about sex and alcohol - even more than Americans (perish the thought!) - but really that's just hypocrisy - they grab every chance they can for debauchery. And just in case you get a bit confused about this (because these days American heroes also like sex and alcohol), Clancy makes it clear that *their* sex lives are seedy and laughable - they have to pay for sex or get off on-line because, hey, they're big losers. Oh, and you're right - even if they're losing their own life in some suicidal attack (as opposed to, say, dropping bombs safely from controlled air space) they are pathological sickos that relish shooting women in the back.<br /><br />How can Clancy begin to be taken seriously with such pantomime caricatures - he clearly has made no attempt to discover the motives of the characters he purports to write about. His `thinking' character, young Jack Ryan Jnr. - the prodigy intellect and analyst - isn't happy to just be given orders like the assassin twins - so he goes deeper into this whole business. You know, he even spends a whole morning (after having already been party to two murders) googling for the Koran and glancing through some passages. Well, shut my mouth - that's some serious research - and probably represents the wafer of knowledge Clancy has bothered to attain (or, perhaps, thinks would be perhaps worth attaining some time) before wading into his International Relations for dummies text. But this is post the publication of All Quiet on the Western Front, this is in a time where you can read dissenting opinions from `enemies' first hand on blogs while you're bombing them! It's inexcusable. Maybe you'd find that one of them might have held a dying civilian child (Brian's oft reiterated justification for killing) - this time from American fire. Maybe you'd find more than one.<br /><br />And who are the heroes who epitomise the values of this great nation? Well for Clancy it's pretty much the same person given several different names in the text. Firstly, like good old Louis Lamour's heroes, they have a lot of money. Somebody isn't really worth talking to if they can't make themselvesindependently wealthy. The stock market, for example, should be a game they can play and win - but don't need to take too seriously. Next, they kill people. C'mon, if you don't know how to handle a gun and haven't wasted a few bad guys, you're just not hero material. Ghandi? Jesus? Martin-Luther King? Pussies.<br /><br />And that's about it really. Clancy tries to make us connect a bit more with them because, um, they like fast cars, those guys. And he constantly tells us just how super smart these players are. He has to, because they don't do much that displays intelligence. Where, for example, does our master of espionage make the hit? In a bathroom that anyone could walk into at any time. He stays there for extra time, gloating - and leaving a knife with blood to connect this body with another killed in the same room a few weeks before (no, that won't make the cardiac arrest look at all suspicious!). He then returns to his table with the twins who have just been noticed by everyone in the restaurant, including the waiter who just spilled wine all over them, and who is about to discover a body in the toilets! And we're supposed to think, \\"Aren't these guys amazing - they're just invisible!\\" Do you think their descriptions just might come out in the police interviews? \\"Oh, yeah, and one of them was the ex-President's son.\\" Yeah, seriously invisible to appoint, say, Chelsea Clinton as your nation's secret assassin - but this isn't even me exaggerating - it's the literal equivalent.<br /><br />So, actually, it doesn't even work as an average thriller. This is garbage from several angles. Still, the worst is the arrogant racism that doesn't even recognise itself. That can say you don't even need a photo to work out who the terrorist in Vienna is, just find someone as \\"Middle-Eastern as hell\\" - yeah, that's the guy, whack him.themselves independently wealthy. The stock market, for example, should be a game they can play and win - but don't need to take too seriously. Next, they kill people.

He has to, because they don't do much that displays intelligence. Where, for example, does our master of espionage make the hit? In a bathroom that anyone could walk into at any time. He stays there for extra time, gloating - and leaving a knife with blood to connect this body with another killed in the same room a few weeks before (no, that won't make the cardiac arrest look at all suspicious!). He then returns to his table with the twins who have just been noticed by everyone in the restaurant, including the waiter who just spilled wine all over them, and who is about to discover a body in the toilets! And we're supposed to think, \\"Aren't these guys amazing - they're just invisible!\\" Do you think their descriptions just might come out in the police interviews? \\"Oh, yeah, and one of them was the ex-President's son.\\" Yeah, seriously invisible to appoint, say, Chelsea Clinton as your nation's secret assassin - but this isn't even me exaggerating - it's the literal equivalent.  <br /> <br />So, actually, it doesn't even work as an average thriller. This is garbage from several angles. Still, the worst is the arrogant racism that doesn't even recognise itself. That can say you don't even need a photo to work out who the terrorist in Vienna is, just find someone as \\"Middle-Eastern as hell\\" - yeah, that's the guy, whack him.	2005-07-16

An odd genre that has a murder as the central plot device, but we're all meant to be well aware that, like in cartoons, nobody really gets hurt: the victim will get up, dust themselves off, and be ready to be done in or doing-in in the next novel. The TV drama based around this series suits it perfectly, with the same cast taking turns in different roles throughout. Still it's an enormously popular style, so safe in the knowledge that we're deep in convention we can have a nice time playing in a situation that in reality would be awful.<br /><br />While Stout never goes over the top (which is why I stopped at a B - I smirked occasionally but never laughed out loud), the characters and manor of dialogue are not too distant from a Wodehouse novel. Stout's narrator is dryly humorous rather than ingenuously hilarious. He has his moments:<br /><br />\\"It is always a temptation to monkey with locks, and one of the best ways to test ears is to enter someone's castle uninvited and, while you are looking here and there for something interesting, listen for footsteps on the stairs or the sound of an elevator. If you don't hear them in time your hearing is defective, and you should try some other line of work when you're out and around again.\\"<br /><br />Nice timing - it's the sort of thing I'd expect to hear from John Clarke. The confident females we encounter sparkle in conversation, and most of the company is pleasant enough to be with. Stout makes the trip quite agreeable.<br /><br />He puts himself under a bit of pressure with the frequent references to Wolfe's `genius' (I always prefer a writer to convince me of a character's outstanding attributes by their actions and dialogue rather than expecting me to just take their word for it that they're intelligent/funny/cunning or whatever), but part of the reason for this is he enjoys playing with the hierarchy and professional protocol of various detectives who enjoy sorting out their place in the pecking order, and need a grand master to aspire to.<br /><br />This is not fantastic or powerful or stunning - but it was never meant to be. Stout was a prolific professional writer turning out another workmanlike product in his justifiably successful franchise - this is hardly his attempt at a masterwork, but it is a solid, enjoyable light crime novel.detectives who enjoy sorting out their place in the pecking order, and need a grand master to aspire to.  <br /> <br />This is not fantastic or powerful or stunning - but it was never meant to be.

While the structure is still enjoyable, particularly where you see the threads of past and future, an epic series only works for me if it is steadily building to a stunning climax (as in the slowest of burns in Dumas' fabulous Count of Monte Cristo), or if it meanders a bit but each episode is good enough to stand alone (hard to think of any that keep up this standard - perhaps Saberhagen's Swords series, although at times there isn't really a uniting plot over some of the episodes, they just happen to be inhabiting the same world) - or if it manages to do both (which is why there's still daylight between Tolkien and everyone else).<br /><br />There's some fairly tenuous things going on here as Kerr pushes Rhodry off to Bardek. Sure, it could be an interesting change of scene, but I found it a bit hard to swallow that a couple of bribes and lucky conversations managed to overcome the efforts of the entire kingdom of Deverry, backed up by close friends, the good wife, and various and sundry dweomer masters. The sub-plot around Jill's tragic seduction/ensorcelment was the only part of the book that made me forget I was reading for a while, and while potent in itself, not enough to bring me to recommend this volume except as part of the series. Maybe I need to leave it a year or two before I pick up Volume 4 (like I do with Rowling and Pratchett to maximise pleasure), which is a shame because clearly the intent is to lock me in. Hey, I want to be locked in, but this is a low security facility with day release (yes, I freely admit that this is an appalling metaphor).	2005-06-13

While some would find it stifling, the undercurrent of clear morality is a vital part of what lifts this book out from the pack. Lewis had something to say beyond convention, he managed to combine it with his adult love of `fairy-tales', and this without condescension. Sure the characters are one-dimensional (something that put me off a bit on re-reading 'Out of the Silent Planet'), but do we really need tortured vacillating disenchantment in a kid's book? Moreover in some ways this allows for greater truth: we can lose moral clarity in hurling words, justifications and complications into some choices that are, at heart, simple. Lewis was a master of the stinging comparison, which can be used well or ill: just because a metaphor is clever hardly makes it true. However I think that there's a deal of insight and honesty in, for example, the revelation of Edmund's (let's just come out and say it) sinful thought processes. How does Lewis know about such ugly self-deception? There's a deal of confession in having the character most open to temptation as an intellectual, like himself.<br /><br />So, unlike some other reviewers, I reject the notion that you lose the joy of the book once you realise the deliberately Christian nature of this fable. Take that away and the book becomes just another cynical money-making venture. Lewis, rather, cares about his readers and wants to offer them a taste of something good, and an awareness of something evil. It's not that he's tacked a dumb and nasty old superstition onto a fabulous story - the story is only fabulous because it's fuelled by a passionate belief in the prime value of goodness.	2005-06-12
US	34705979	R1CP9WST9FMAT4	0312864744	356296858	Ports of Call	Books	2	1	13	N	N	Ostentatious expression, light comic prurience and violence	I figure Vance must have been in his eighties when this was published, and as a prolifically established name I suspect the quality control had slipped Asimov style. I haven't minded a couple of his books, much as the language is usually pretentious. It's such a ubiquitous flaw, particularly in fantasy (Hugh Cook, Terry Goodkind) to think that virtually mock-heroically pompous expression, reaching for the thesaurus constantly with a High Schooler's concern that clear and precise language isn't somehow impressive enough - or, rather, with the foolish arrogance to feel that using antiquated or obscure constructions and vocabulary displays great intellect. Much as they may hope to, it's not putting them in the league of `great' writers like Shakespeare, Austen or Samuel Johnson: they haven't worked out that the reason classic authors like these sound so different to everyday speech is more to do with historically dated language than some objectively `higher' style - to their intended audience of contemporaries their now elevated sounding words were far more immediately accessible. It might be fun to have a single character that speaks in that self-consciously ostentatious way, but in Vance we have every character, and the narrator, speaking in the same irritating style. Yes, every single one - from carnival entertainers, to isolated tribesmen to a murderous, uneducated, impoverished bar slut. It's some relief that Vance finds it difficult to maintain this contrived style to its most painful level throughout the entire novel - he unwittingly slips into greater sense and clarity here and there - but they are only slips.<br /><br />There is no plot. There starts to be one, and, who knows, there might be another sequel or two to tie up the starter story, but it's really pretty random. At least this is more justifiable in context than some other equally undisciplined books - as the title suggests, our protagonist is unattached and pretty happy to be fairly aimlessly flitting about from exotic port to port as crew on an opportunistic cargo (and, at a pinch, passenger) vessel. Hey, there are writers whose style and individual episodes are good enough that they can get away with weak or even non-existent plots on occasion (Fry, Wodehouse, Adams, Keillor, Banks), but Vance isn't one of them. OK, there is some charm, some wit - but not enough. Vance perhaps felt he'd bolstered this by adding some daydream titillation - our young hero Myron can't seem to help but find himself in intimate situations with attractive young women. It's not soft porn, but it is somewhere near to Star Trek 1/James Bond. Vance was born in 1916, and his presentation of playthings women and utterly expendable third world characters is neither politically correct nor insightful: rather it tends to confirm why some attitudes were better left in the last century. His men are supposed to be cool, I suppose, never dropping their carefully scripted lines under fire or seduction.<br /><br />In his defence he was consciously writing a light comic daydream novel - it was never meant to be some searing social commentary. I suspect the humour may have worked better for someone with more of his own generation's presuppositions.

Kerr's reincarnation structure gives her the freedom to run off into `new' self-contained stories within the one larger story: they still relate to (particularly with the continuity of Nevyn) and shape `current' events, but give the satisfaction of some internal resolution. Half this volume is devoted to a virtual novella set three-hundred years prior, and Kerr has the fun of yet again playing out her basic characters with a few intriguing alternatives - very much the parallel universe feel. I found the Gweniver-Dannyn-Ricyn incarnation more potent than the attached `main' storyline, which was OK, sort of a drug-dealer whodunit, but not as enjoyable. Besides, I always hate it when charismatic heroes go broody, and hopefully Rhodry will be able to make his peace with his lowered status and make better company in the next book.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy it as much as Daggerspell, but she's hardly dropped the ball here, and the form she's running with is still coherent and satisfying. Some things are potentially worrying - getting the balance right so Nevyn doesn't find everything too easy (cf. Belgareth), but can still bring justice and some impressive majesty (cf. Gandalf): it is nice that she doesn't have him being too coy about his powers if need be. I think she overuses the flashes of `dweomer-cold' that so many characters inexplicably have: sure you can have magic, but it's not as satisfying if it can just be inserted randomly - it should cost something and work within its own suspension of disbelief parameters/logic - in other ways it does in this series.	2005-04-15

I've just seen a few kids into her stuff, a few awards, and thought I might as well take a peek.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with it - usable basic premise, appropriate humour, kid's world view. Perhaps the plaudits it's received from adults relate to the relatively subtle (compared to a lot of, \\"And what did we learn today, kids,\\" style fiction) encouragement to be nice to your siblings, with the realistic presentation of unconscious nastiness that can go on. Well paced etc. Just not for Dad's Christmas stocking (unlike some other kids' books that crossover a bit more - or don't kids like the Jungle Book any more?). Does it, however, achieve its own aims?<br /><br />Dunno, ask a juvenile.	2005-04-05

It's like a heist movie, with two getaways, once illegally, once legally. Grisham does very well mixing up both stories to keep the pages turning, revealing a bit here, a bit there - from four years before, and in the present. It's almost impossible to discuss this effort without spoilers, so consider yourself warned. It's purely a book for the ride, and the ride is clever and well paced. The `hero' plays the system and the people in it like a deck of cards, and Grisham entertainingly spins out the basic plot with admirable control. He also gives us the common heist movie satisfaction of knowing that the `victims' actually deserve what they get.<br /><br />Or, at least, he does until the final twist. That didn't really work for me. Until now each of the actions are carefully reasoned and justified. The final twist is pretty random - just a mandatory final page surprise. But good surprise endings integrate with a bunch of things earlier in the book, making us rethink them. This one doesn't, it's just a betrayal of trust that hasn't been hinted at previously - it's surprise for surprise sake only, and it doesn't give us the satisfaction of the previous two heists: it's too easy, and it's unjust. Moreover a bit of thought raises some dumb contradictions around the question: why does she disappear? If, as the last pages say:<br /><br />\\"She knew where to hide, and how to disappear, and how to change identities, and how to move money instantly, and how to spend it without drawing attention. She had learned from a master. Patrick had taught her all too well the art of vanishing. No one would find Eva, unless, of course, she wanted them to...Her face would not be seen, because he'd taught her how to hide it...\\"<br /><br />why did she wait until Patrick had given back the 90 million! Moreover, if Patrick was the master, why did he ever bother returning? The rest of the book explains that he chose to return so that he wouldn't have to look over his shoulder any more. He's got the interest on 90 million over four years, and no one is chasing him - that's the beauty of the heist, the satisfaction of safely signing in to a hotel in his own name. Yet Eva is left with the ordeal Patrick knowingly risked torture to escape. A still unsatisfying but less stupid finish would have seen Eva meet Patrick and calmly say, \\"Thanks for the cash, it's been fun,\\" and then return home publicly. Patrick could follow her there, but do nothing - and she wouldn't have to hide from anyone. That would make sense of her waiting until Patrick had neutralised the the threat from Stephano's employers and the FBI, returning the bulk of the money to call off the dogs. Does she suddenly not care about her father, that she will never go back to her beloved Rio or her family? (for some unknown reason - why is she running from Patrick? What can he do? Who else is chasing her?) This doesn't square with anything we knew about her until now. Nor does this talk of her as the master of invisibility work with her relatively easy capture in the US - what possible motivation would she have had for being caught? Either she's not so competent, or she actually does love Patrick and is prepared to risk herself for him. Eva the scheming betrayer has no reason to risk the torture she knows Patrick underwent - from the same people hunting her in the states - if she, as the book contradictorily contends - can disappear at will, and/or is just using Patrick. The only possible reason for her risking her life to get Sandy all the material to give Patrick his safety is so that she also can stop running.<br /><br />So, bummer about the very end. As I said, until then the plot is very well handled and a pleasure to follow. Still, it is a one-dimensional read - nothing much in the way of character or relationships: Patrick, and by extension, the reader, only thinks of people as tools. Don't read this for humour or insight or powerful narrative (as you can find in addition to a decently paced plot with some other writers - say Chandler or Perez-Reverte) - but it's still an OK read. Just tear out the last few pages before you pass it on.his for humour or insight or powerful narrative (as you can find in addition to a decently paced plot with some other writers - say Chandler or Perez-Reverte) - but it's still an OK read.

Our likeable but not especially strong or gifted hero sets off on an adventure - to find his lost fianc&eacute;. On his way he meets the tough and noble Thanes (rangers), encounters a royal court where he befriends a bluff and hearty prince and is discomforted by the dissolute Queen mother and her Consort, forms a strange alliance with a traditionally opposed race, and becomes a vital part in the defeat of an ancient evil foe. OK, standard fantasy fare here, but generally a well enough executed enjoyable derivative (and what more should you reasonably expect from a first novel?).<br /><br />There is some originality in making all the characters cats in a contemporary rural setting, with \\"M'an\\" as their incidental servants. Fortunately Williams keeps this in the background and doesn't milk it too much to be clever or confuse a (adolescent) fantasy with a social satire.<br /><br />There's a nice epilogue too, with (spoiler warning) Tailchaser finding that his `heart's desire' is not what he thought it to be. Williams does a decent job showing how his protagonist has grown through his experiences and is now a far wiser and self-assured animal.<br /><br />So, I was happy to go along for the ride and thinking Williams (who I haven't read before) was a pleasant enough discovery for me. However he lost me with his magic and mysticism. Not because I don't like magic and mysticism, don't get me wrong (`some of my best friends..'etc.), but because I don't like the resolution to a whole novel (and, in this case, of millennia) to be based on an, until now, minor character, suddenly realising, \\"Hey, strewth, that's right - I'm a god! I can fix everything! Lucky you were humming that old tune, Tailchaser'. Really. And we're supposed to buy that somehow Tailchaser's done something wise and noble and insightful and deserves praise for something outside of anyone's control.

It feels too palatable to me as non-autistic to feel the structure and style is utterly authentic - but it's still an impressive imaginative feat.<br /><br />It's more than that. It's very satisfying as a detective novel. Who did kill the dog? And finding *that* out only invites more questions - bigger and more threatening ones. There's that lovely twist of the knife when we realise this diverting investigation about other people actually is coming right back to suddenly be very personal. There are plausible surprises that really manage to effect you while integrating perfectly with the crime plot and building intensity.<br /><br />It's more than that. These characters, Christopher, his family and neighbours, really manage to come across as believable people. They are imperfect, they do good things, bad things, but always understandable things. Sometimes you want to get into the pages and shout at them, but even when they arouse our anger they've still got our sympathy: not bad given the extremity of their behaviour.<br /><br />And this is not even to mention the pleasure of Chris' deadpan narration of constant, often laugh out loud funny, dialogue misunderstandings, nor the thought-provoking (if at times straw-man) philosophical asides.

Self-indulgent	A riddle: What could be more pathetic than Grimes' character Alejandro Vlasic? Grimes pours out the scorn, portraying this ridiculous figure in his ostentatious dress and preening, and laughable jealousy of his commercially successful genre fiction colleague. He sniffs arrogantly at her merely populist work, embarrassingly thrusting copies of his own justifiably ignored tiny single volume of pretentious poetry at anyone passing - all the while eating his liver in envy. We're left in no doubt that, unlike his colleague, he's a complete loser.<br /><br />More pathetic than petty little Professor Vlasic? Well, how about a commercially successful genre fiction writer going to the trouble of carefully creating such a character? Really for Grimes to spend so much time glorifying a character, ahem, much like herself, and pillorying those who, it seems, she fears criticism from, is at best embarrassing for the reader.<br /><br />Maybe I've started at the wrong end of her career - an amazon reviewer elsewhere recommended her `Man with a load of Mischief', but I found this later `Horse' at my local library instead. It felt really indulgent - many of the characters are writers, and Grimes just seems unaware that it's bad form for her to so unsubtly laud ones like herself. Moreover it feels like Jury and Melrose are supposed to be old friends - perhaps back for a last time reunion and we're just supposed to relish their presence. I don't even know if I would have, however, even if I had enjoyed them in previous books. It feels like those awful 'On Tour' TV episodes - you know, the Happy Days cast goes to Australia or something.<br /><br />The detective story, at least, is engaging enough while it's there, but it's hardly central and driving. This is usually for me an attraction of a crime novel: I particularly enjoy ones that have enough going in character, humour and observation that they don't stand or fall on the plot - much as we can enjoy some of the ride when it's driving things.

However, the feel of Adams and Pratchett is so strong... Moreover it may be useful to point out where Fforde differs from both.<br /><br />The rules of the world - the glee with which the author can hurl his characters through six impossible things before breakfast - is straight out of whatever comedy/sf/fantasy sub-genre you could call the Adams/Pratchett thing. Fantasy/SF allows them wonderful licence in imagining worlds just a bit like ours but exaggerated or twisted. Indeed, Fforde is clearly writing alternative history/near future and tying his events more closely to the current time. A world where literature is followed more like football teams or religious cults, for example, is the sort of amusing and well executed notion I'd expect to find in either other author. The moderately central plot driving device of the Prose Portal felt very much like something Pratchett would build around (and even reminded me of Voldemort attacking Ginny Weasley from his magical diary).<br /><br />The characters, similarly, are generally charming - and I think this is core to their popularity. For all the darkness and life threatening situations that can arise, most of the people, particularly the central characters, are amicable eccentric company - you like spending time with them. Fforde, like Pratchett and unlike Adams, throws in some irredeemable baddies along the way, but they don't set the tone of the book. Moreover Fforde's action hero Thursday Next is given some breadth as a character - haunted war veteran, smart-mouthed Chandleresque detective, vulnerable girl in love - and the book pretty much got away with it.<br /><br />What particularly impressed me earlier on - apart from the laudable feat of being able to produce something worthy of comparison to two such able writers - was the mixing of serious and emotional bits with the comedy. I think Fforde pulled this off better than Pratchett, who can be irritatingly preachy at times, and Adams who feels just a bit more random to me. Thursday's personal saga with her comrade brother and her first love surprisingly integrates with an over the top fantasy-comedy. And her older brother, who I assumed was set up for a fall, actually was a lovely surprise and a powerful vehicle to help Thursday overcome some demons. Really enjoyable to have a funny and clever book that can also even offer a bit of half-decent drama.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed with the d&eacute;nouement, it felt a bit too colour-by-numbers feel-good to me. Since Hades had no history or motive but just was this superhuman psycho out of and moving to nothing, his ultimate and pretty casual demise didn't mean that much. Fforde didn't give him any character (stock master criminal #4, even down to the arrogant educated dialogue): as Tony Hines ably said in *his* amazon review: `And if you're looking for a complex antagonist, forget it; Archeron Hades, Thursday Next's nemesis, might as well go by the name Snidely Whiplash and twirl his handlebar mustache.' Sure he was playing with the Shakespeare thing of all these happy weddings to finish the day, but it got a bit cloying for me (and Landen is the merest foil) - if he was just going to spoil us with the big cake at the end I'd rather just have had a little `happily ever after' epilogue.<br /><br />Yeah, for all its strengths of humour, charm and originality, it should never be sold to anyone as a detective novel (and yes, this is possible even in a novel requiring so much suspension of disbelief). The central mystery doesn't exist - we know from almost chapter one who the bad guy is (and we don't even have an attempt to slowly work out the motive or vulnerability to solve how to defeat him). In a sense it's more a thriller - but with the wildly random tangents (hey, let's save the world from a temporal anomaly on the way home), it's a bit silly to expect thereader to run with any sort of suspense: we're aware that the rules can all change in an instant. The way `The Chamber of Secrets' deals with *its* prose portal is far more satisfying, plotwise, as a mystery/thriller. I think Fforde needed to tighten things up a bit to try for this aspect of the book, or alternatively to consciously make the thriller aspect incidental and revel in his anarchic stuff (as Adams often does - although the fabulous Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is surprisingly coherent). As it is he falls a bit between two stools.<br /><br />Whatever, a nice discovery - there's not too many of this calibre, and I'll look forward to reading some more of his stuff.e're aware that the rules can all change in an instant.

US	34705979	RALJTQYOIMX8O	0451526295	569473707	Mansfield Park	Books	3	6	10	N	N	Censorious heroine and plot, less fun than usual	It's hard to review this book in the way that I prefer to: subjectively and unselfconsciously. I don't want to be particularly conscious of the fact that I'll be reviewing a book while I'm reading it - the reading should be for its own sake. Moreover since I'm not writing under any commission or compunction I should be unconcerned about reactions. I don't have the time for lots of rewrites, and if most of the point of the exercise is personal pleasure it's absurd if I'm writing as a chore.<br /><br />However ... I can't shake the knowledge of approaching Austen as part of the canon of English Literature. Her sacrosanct words have been praised and pored over unreservedly for centuries and her fans are legion (a sister of mine could virtually site you chapter and verse of any sentence you read her). Offering an opinion of anything she's written places you in the sights of a whole genre - as opposed to, say, mentioning that you didn't enjoy the last Clancy thriller. It's like that old line about responding to a da Vinci: it's not the painting that's being judged.<br /><br />So with all that baggage, onto the review.<br /><br />It was refreshing to spend some time in a book so different to most others I read. Once you've got your 19th century language `sea-legs' (something that generally settles after a few chapters) the novelty is no longer an obstacle to enjoyment - quite the opposite. Moreover the structure of the book felt different: Austen has no problem having major characters suddenly virtually disappear, as with the Miss Bertrams. Also there's the usual pleasure of stepping outside the assumed values of your own century - there's nothing that quite highlights your own assumptions as reading those contrary ones of different times.<br /><br />That being said, this book is quite didactic, stiflingly so in the first half where I was growing weary of the sheer volume of gratification I was supposed to gather by the constant belabouring of Mrs Norris' abundant shortcomings - or rather of her single, if major, shortcoming. I wasn't at all clear on whether we were meant to wryly smile at (the now unfortunately named) Fanny's naïve blanket moral condemnations of just about everyone except Edmund, or rather to similarly look down upon the characters with the assured condescension of the author herself. Did Austen so blithely judge, rank and dismiss those of her own acquaintance with the regal arrogance she did with these fictional characters? The right way to interact with society it appears is to almost instantly decide the quality of the character of the person you meet, and to not be swayed from your initial assessment: Fanny's severe and almost universal moral condemnations are utterly vindicated at the novel's unambiguous conclusion.<br /><br />I suppose I found the ubiquitous censure uncomfortable: Wodehouse could poke fun at languid, self-indulgent aristocrats without requiring our contempt. To relish this Austen I feel you have to relish your smug superiority over most everyone.<br /><br />Yeah, I suppose it's the smugness that dilutes the pleasure of this highly developed morality tale. Along the way we get an ably narrated window on two lifestyles of the early 19th Century. For all of Austen's theme that virtue overrides wealth (and, indeed, that wealth and indolence are a great danger for the young), class is massive: probably the first thing you need to know about a person, even before you know their character, is what they're worth. Have we changed all that much since then? I suspect so: at least now it's somewhat bad form to inquire about and discuss the relative incomes of your friends and acquaintances - here it's the very first thing that must be established.<br /><br />Interesting to have as your heroine a shy, relatively inarticulate girl whose only assets are her high moral standards and personal integrity (oh, and she looks OK - but by no means the belle). Others fall by the wayside who show much greater sparkle, wit, verve, passion, good humour, talent, beauty or wealth. Austen really hammers home the condemnation of shallow worldliness, the nominalism that plays at virtue as merely an aspect of social point scoring. That being said, there's no room for Scarlet Letter development of personality or awareness of hypocrisy: you make one mistake of a publicly sexual nature and you are rightly tagged for life; you maintain your marriage - on whatever terms - and you're essentially OK.<br /><br />The conclusion of the novel felt pretty sudden, and I was surprised, along with the rest of the characters, to find that young uncompromising Fanny was right to dismiss the charming Mr Crawford all along (always an actor). It's a fairy tale for good girls, and she gets her man, despite all circumstances and the fact that she never had the pride to seriously hope for him. Holier-than-thou squares are more commonly a target for fiction, even if, as in other Austens, they may only be affectionately pilloried. Here we don't get to smirk at her unconscious jealousy of Miss Crawford: when it came down to it, Edmund was being a fool after all.<br /><br />I did love the single sentence where Austen pops in personally, as authors were far more prone to do back then:<br /><br />\\"Let other pens dwell on guilt an misery. I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault themselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with the rest.\\"<br /><br />It's like your little DVD extra, where the author explains their approach. Not to be overused, likewise I liked Lodge popping in just for a few words in 'How Far Can You Go'.<br /><br />So, an interesting and non-formulaic read, but without a lot of the humour and wit that established Austen's popularity. Austen herself said of it:<br /><br />\\"I hope on the credit of P. & P. [it] will sell well, tho' not half so entertaining.\\"<br /><br />My sister tells me that it's not the Austen she'd recommend anyone start with., wit, verve, passion, good humour, talent, beauty or wealth.

Sure, it's meant to be larger than life and a page-turner, but the values probably left a more abiding impression for me than the ride. Nothing really surprising I suppose: an American hero can fight better than anyone else, turn pretty girls' heads, and make lots of money - there is seen to be great virtue in being able to amass wealth: poverty is in a real sense disreputable.<br /><br />I've only read a couple of L'amours that I recall, and both pick up on the closeness of Alaska to Russia. Our hearts are meant to surge with nationalistic pride at the visionaries who aim to win Alaska for America. One odd variation in the story is that the standard babe heroine (who is partly won by what would now be mere sexual harassment) is married to a respectable older gent, so our love interests must curb their passions until he has the grace to die.<br /><br />Borderline - it's not terrible, but there's better average books around. At least it's not an utterly colour by numbers Western - he's tried to include a few different locations.	2004-12-26

That could be part of the fun, and there is something of the D & D silly campaign where a hundred unlikely events are meant to happen to our intrepid adventurers. Still it gets a bit too silly for me, and I'm getting to not really care that much about the Warrior in Jet and Gold who can just turn up magically along with any era shaping magical item. Same with the deadly foe - far too lazy in just saying, \\"Oh, sure, they all got routed and defeated, um, and a million of them got killed ... but, ah, NOW there's, um TWO MILLION, and the bad guy didn't really die, and they're back!\\". I mean, who cares? Either something magical suddenly shows up that will defeat them all, or, even if you do, suddenly they'll just somehow regroup to be back to threaten again in the next sequel. The heroes are embarrassingly standard in the way they can fight all day hugely outnumbered with dwindling remains of their army being cut down around them, but, of course, not suffer a scratch and have nothing more than a bit of fatigue. Yisselda as heroine becomes utterly clich&eacute;d: here, let me just stand to one side being feminine and either helpless or emotionally/sexually supportive. Oh, and Hawkmoon starts getting all broody - save me from broody heroes! Ugh.<br /><br />I was just about never `in' the story, I was always outside looking in, and frequently shaking my head at the level of guff.<br /><br />The casual background of atrocities gets a bit sickening after a while, and also feels lazy and contrived, \\"Oh, yeah, THIS guy was so bad, he, um, got people's babies and killed them. (Hang on, I've done that one). And then he ate them! (Oh, done that one too). In front of the mother!!! (Yeah, that'll do).\\" This gets offensive pretty quick, especially when I think it's meant to be, you know, hard core - Moorcock saying his bad guys are, well, really bad - it's spotty nerds who've never punched someone in their life trying to impress each other with fight scenes. The author feels nothing for these throwaway victims, we're not really meant to either, they're just a bit of local colour (cf. the similarly blithe use of comic atrocity in Goodkind's second rate Wizard's First Rule). Thus D'Averc can simply flip from villain to hero because all those people he blithely killed were, remember, only MINOR characters.<br /><br />It's all pretty bleak: I could maybe cope with the lazy plotting if we were having some fun on the way (as Fafard and the Grey Mouser at times do without this oppressive background), but the only hope of the book is the action. It's hard to care about the action when we know the author can and will just randomly pull out something from nowhere with no reference to a wider world (oh, hey, here's an ancient civilisation with vastly superior technological weapons we've stumbled onto. Phew, that was lucky).<br /><br />So, after giving The Jewel in the Skull a bit of a rap I'm not so keen to move onto volume 3 (except to work out whether I should just clear this stuff from my bookshelves altogether).<br /><br />2½*re, well, really bad - it's spotty nerds who've never punched someone in their life trying to impress each other with fight scenes.

US	34705979	R14UHCW7F3Z5EI	0060928557	137095710	Heat Wave: A Novel	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Potent, capable, slow-moving, tragic, venomous	Lively is a capable professional writer. As she describes some of the scenes you can see past them to the novelist carefully surveying a place, taking notes and returning to proficiently write them up. The novel moves incredibly slowly, as if Lively can't bear to leave any detail overlooked, any hint of shoddiness.<br /><br />We get such a strong feeling of being inside Pauline, and Pauline is a triumph of authenticity. Lively, like Lodge, has the sense (and brave candour) to write mainly from the perspective of someone she could best understand - someone almost autobiographically like herself. This is not to say this is anything but imaginative fiction, and the events some sort of thinly disguised `tell-all'. Rather the way the central character views herself and the people around her feels very true. Hey, I'm not an introspective middle-aged woman, how would I know, but I suspect I've got a better idea of it after reading this book.<br /><br />Slow paced, sure, but Lively analytically explores a classic common domestic tragedy: adultery. She doesn't rage about it - these are educated English characters, there's no swearing, slamming doors or gunplay. But don't mistake it - there is an ice-cool venom here too.<br /><br />There's also despair at impotence: Pauline watches her daughter's innocent contentment being punctured; she understands to several decimal places exactly what is going on - and what will ensue; how awful and unjust it is; and how there is essentially nothing she can do about it.<br /><br />The novel eschews the satisfying relief of offering the characters (and the readers) the `answer': \\"Now listen, Teresa, what you need to do right now is...\\". Rather it more insightfully forces us to endure the ugly tension of living and conversing with someone who has betrayed and is essentially unrepentant and relatively unscathed. While the one deeply hurt through no personal fault is made to feel guilty. The conversations, the situations, the irresolvable tensions are played out in this awful understated but plausible way. Indeed, we get to feel it twice as Lively seamlessly moves between past and present.<br /><br />I'm still left a bit uncomfortable with Pauline's (Lively's) utter certainty. In her world, much as in that of Passing On, we know precisely what to think of each character. I don't really like having it spelt out for me quite so restrictively, and I'm forced towards suspicion of her implacable judgements. Oh, she's careful to make sure we know this is not simply an `all men are bastards' diatribe: Pauline has genuine affection for Hugh, and shows motherly care for Chris Rogers. But can we just write some folks off the way they are here? Maybe we can: if I was writing an honest novel about my feelings there'd be some irredeemable turds in there, and I'd not give them the time and space Lively gives to Maurice and Harry. But, as I say, this book gives you no room at all to move.<br /><br />Spoiler warning:<br /><br />If you've read the book, you know exactly what I'm about to address. If you haven't read the book, show some sense and stop reading this review now.<br /><br />Blimey - that was not the finish I was expecting, even if I might have wanted it. Very much like Passing On - all the action is crammed into the last chapter, or in this case, the last pages. Blam. That venom thing I was mentioning earlier .... Here's this articulate, utterly civilised, educated, thinking, academic caring older woman, and the moral to the story: \\"It'd be better for everyone if you were dead.\\" No, this is not hyperbole.<br /><br />Lively takes the liberty of fiction to apply a solution that does all it can to shake off the complacency of the adulterer.olvable tensions are played out in this awful understated but plausible way.

It starts a bit like the movie `Paris, Texas', where you suddenly are in the middle of seemingly unbelievable people in extreme circumstances, and then over time you realise how credible they are.<br /><br /> <br /><br />I don't know how `real' these characters are - everything is always life or death, intense pain and/or emotional climax: is it that Mosley's skipping the bits where `nothing much happened that afternoon', or is he suggesting that this sort of overwhelming life is actually happening constantly? At times it feels like a `Pulp Fiction' style sensory overload fantasy, at others a `serious' character novel.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The issues they're facing are not mine, but the stories and characters are engaging (and confronting), and well told.

Well, as he points out in his `rare or medium rare' chapter, one ecologist might panic about there only being hundreds of one species left - but that's the dream of another ecologist working to save a species with only fifteen: `Hundreds is common'.<br /><br />I suppose there's some level of compassion-fatigue with endangered species - I was not surprised at the content of most of this book, much as I'm a little dismayed that I'm not more dismayed (if you know what I mean).<br /><br />Adams, as you might have picked up if you've read any of his books, isn't too bad at this writing thingy, and the prose is engaging, amusing and occasionally insightful. Adams is good company, he's not preachy or condescending, doesn't claim to have all the answers, and describes what he sees without forcing it into some brutal agenda.<br /><br />To be honest, my greatest pleasure in the book was not being informed - I'm sure you could find out this and more detailed information from other sources - it was in being informed by this particular narrator. I particularly enjoyed his presentation of some of the wonderful boffins in the field, particularly the Australian poisons expert - hilarious. Towards the latter part of the book I found some of these portraits more obviously contrived (and somehow the birds failed to interest as much as the earlier beasts).<br /><br />That being said, there's enough fascinating people, places and fauna throughout - plus Adams' quirky perspectives, friendly company, consistent wit and occasional comic triumphs to recommend the read.	2004-12-10

No, but it might be to someone who'd never heard it done before, or who'd never actually enjoyed bathetic dialogue and substantial characters simultaneously.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Every joke is spelt out clearly and laboured, such as a scene where someone observes that the two fighting knights might be shamming a bit.

I remember enjoying the Runestaff series as a young teen, but being really turned off by the ugly prurience of some later book of his I read. I was actually expecting to find nothing but tripe upon rereading this book, but have to admit it wasn't too bad. Sure the characters are stereotypical, but this is quite conscious and deliberate. The world is hardly as richly and deeply painted as the Middle Earth, but then again, which other world is? It's a workable distant future, and the feel of the settings isn't too far from that of Leiber's Swords series (a comparison Moorcock would be happy with), as is the sense that there are whimsically enigmatic and powerful forces tooling about with our protagonist.<br /><br /> <br /><br />He also rights some classic annoying conventions of fantasy - a bit like having someone re-shoot a roadrunner/coyote cartoon when the insufferable bird finally gets what's coming to him. One is that when the hero has a virtual spy camera planted in his forehead, the supposedly intelligent goodies who are being spied on don't just fall for it or wring their hands at the problem. Rather they do what the reader has done - establish that it only does vision, not sound, and have some good conversations in the dark in working out how to deal with it. Another is that a thousand year old character manages to lose his life relatively easily - something that happens far too often in fantasy - yet Moorcock at least has the consistency have him mystically return to life: how else has he survived this long unless he's got the hang of resurrection or got better survival techniques? And finally he sets up the standard mutually attracted hero and heroine who just can't seem to speak their feelings - and rather than spin this out for a book (or several) with increasingly implausible reasoning, the girl has the sense to make her feelings abundantly clear the night before the hero is liable to head off on a doomed quest. Ahhh. The way Hawkmoon meets his offsider is also nice - ironic, humorous, realistic, anti-climactic.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Sure, it's pulp, but pulp without a lot of annoying gritty bits you often have to suffer (pulp without the pulp if you like).<br /><br /> <br /><br />Maybe I've been nicer than it deserves because my expectations were so low.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Maybe not (I'll give Volume 2 another look anyway).The way Hawkmoon meets his offsider is also nice - ironic, humorous, realistic, anti-climactic.  <br /> <br />Sure, it's pulp, but pulp without a lot of annoying gritty bits you often have to suffer (pulp without the pulp if you like).  <br /> <br />Maybe I've been nicer than it deserves because my expectations were so low.  <br /> <br />Maybe not (I'll give Volume 2 another look anyway).	2004-12-10

Baddies malarky) that Martin's forcing onto us: don't assume. Several characters that are, plotwise, `baddies' and have done some undeniably awful things, are still managing to arouse our sympathies. Best not to get to know your enemies too well, you might start to understand them, and that can only complicate things. Moreover Martin allows `goodies' to do things that may have felt noble but turn out to be stupid (the classic being Catelyn Stark). <br /> <br />Oh, there are still some just plain ugly and evil brutes about, and the odd paragon, but there are a lot in between. Not just, \\"I understand why they're so evil,\\" but I don't hate, for example, that incestuous mongrel who nearly killed a child for simply wandering in at the wrong time. The process is exemplified by Jon Snow, the [...]of the sincere and honourable Ned Stark. Snow holds his honour dearly, unable to claim any family advantage, and joins the black brotherhood, which has only its code of honour to hold it together. He takes his vows of celibacy and fealty seriously. And somehow ends up as a double agent, literally sleeping with the enemy to maintain his cover. What does he now think of oathbreakers? What does he now think of the `others' who, when you get to know them, are often better company than many of the brotherhood?<br /> <br />Danerys is probably still my favourite. She's forming a new dynasty from nothing, but there's some real magic and majesty there. When others say, `that's just the way the world is,\\" she's saying, \\"not once I'm finished with it.\\" And somehow despite circumstances she's making her ridiculous boasts not so ridiculous. Martin has given her a couple of great scenes in the birth of the dragons and the destruction of the slavers. She's also a confused teenager prone to rage, but this is queenly rage too. She's giving the hope of some overall justice and resolution.<br /><br />Part 2: Steel and Snow<br />I think that Martin may have strayed from Epic to Soap Opera. The series is moving too slowly, there are too many characters, and they are killed off or suddenly created with a major role in an almost random fashion. He could say that's part of the deal in times of war: someone will survive whole invasions and then be killed in a minor skirmish. It's in the style of a grand history, and he can be merciless with his characters. He's really challenging the `makers of your own destiny' idea: great and noble (and evil) schemes are just blown out. But I think he erred, for example, with Sandor Clegane's death: how could he have survived all he had with cunning and skill and reading the situation - and then suddenly so out of character misread the one that brought his death? Likewise Tyrion: shrewd and then a fool. And no-one seeming to question that if he was going to poison someone, he wouldn't have done it as ridiculously publicly.<br /> <br />But it's irritating. And I don't really want to be irritated. Please, please, some editing. Perhaps if it was done in another form: set up a world, and then take a different book each to focus on different characters, to tell a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. But he is going for the huge thing of all these concurrent storylines. As I write I'm thinking, \\"C'mon, stay with it, it's a really original approach, breaking totally away from the stifling predictability of probably 95% of the genre.\\"<br /> <br />But when there is no rhyme or reason to who lives and who dies, and Martin seems to be even stalling about getting to the larger threats surrounding the whole continent which will give us some sort of hopefully satisfying conclusion ... and when Martin himself seems to have no clear plan about the plot, but will happilymeander about with whoever's left and whoever appears, it is soap opera-ish. I hope it's not an utterly market driven thing - a very effective way to keep selling books - get them in on a story but, Jordan style, just keep endlessly publishing.<br /> <br />It would be OK if every `episode' was good enough to give pleasure alone, but they're not. Several of them are only `worth' inclusion for their relation to the `main' characters, but are still given far too many words. The dialogue is 99% about the melodramatic action: nobody's saying anything particularly wise or funny or clever. For something this big, he needs a team of writers to keep up the quality.<br /> <br />Much as I think he'd hate the comparison, I think he's done a bit of an Eddings and so far pulled four inconsistent books out of what could have been an excellent two or three. The danger of the genre: Orson Scott Card, Robert Jordan, Julian May and so on and so on. What's holding you is cheap tricks of \\"What will happen to Arya next week, fans?\\" - at some points I find myself saying, \\"I really don't care.\\" This was never the case with Tolkien - because Tolkien had finished the whole thing before he published.

The characters could be described as refreshingly non-stereotypical ... my only problem was that I didn't find them that refreshing. Sure, he writes capably in contemporary urban Indian settings and picks up on religious and racial tensions without merely vilifying one party. There's also something that reminds me of Kipling in the style of short story - a detachment? The supernatural leanings?<br /><br />Whatever, while it was anything but clich&eacute; most of the time, the stories never really got me in. I didn't really identify with or even like any of the central characters - perhaps I'm just the wrong audience for this one. The pages took a while to get through, I didn't really care that much about the outcomes - especially in the `Dynasty' style high-business/social machinations of `Shakti' - the heroes and their quests made them look pathetic to me. And I suppose the final story that's supposed to be the real emotional love story clincher just left me fairly blas&eacute;: the fantastic stories within the stories that navigate the blossoming romance simply weren't that fantastic for me - they didn't begin to overwhelm me the way they apparently overwhelmed the beloved.<br /><br />So, no. It's not badly written, and I suppose I can see why it's received critical acclaim ... but if you find yourself agreeing with my preferences in other reviews, I wouldn't be chasing down this one.	2004-11-11

She does a particularly good job of working the big story around the little ones - something that brings a lot of epic fantasists to grief: you want to have compelling episodes, but not at the expense of something larger making the whole thing cohere and have a sense of movement. By book 3 George R.R. Martin's Ice and Fire series has virtually bloated to soap opera and lost much of the majesty of the frame; in contrast, Eddings' Belgariad was largely just going through the motions for the last few books with the inevitable conclusion ponderously played out. I suppose I should be careful here - a lot of series start well (A Game of Thrones was fantastic) before losing direction, and Kerr may slip over time - but that being said this individual volume has a really pleasing mix of internal resolution and enticing future scope.<br /><br />Much of the cohesion works around her whole reincarnation thing - she can tell several different stories along the way, but we all know they're the same characters experiencing and creating karma. Kudos to her for not only having the originality to apply this notion to fantasy, but the skills to realise it successfully.<br /><br />Moreover the general mythos of the Deverry world is intriguing and consistent, and not the usual vaguely Tolkienesque facade. She doesn't just throw the magic out there utterly randomly, but tries to build something in her etheric planes and give at least some explanation of dweomer and tie it into the history and action of her world.<br /><br />With the exception of us being supposed to wryly smile at `honourable' Rhodry's sewing of his wild oats (just his elven blood at work) - as if in a time before contraception he wasn't being any less than callously irresponsible - there is a refreshing goodness to much of the morality running behind the book. Not nearly as much of your Hollywood virtue equals being able to WIN: cleverly dispatching your enemy may here be presented as culpable vice. Nevyn actually comes across as a pretty wise and compassionate sage by what he says, does, and even learns - rather than us just having to assume he's got some insight because he's a sorcerer. We actually feel sword master Cullyn's greatest victory has nothing to do with his skills, but is his final mature triumph over his fearsome incestuous potential. This unusually non-violent event is something of a climax, as it's also where Nevyn manages to love and respect a previously great foe. As I say, it's a nice change from the standard black and white pap you get, without simply becoming postmodern and confused.<br /><br />Much of the action is in a Shakespearian context. We've got court plottings, fatal tragic personality flaws, inter-royal family revenge, banishment, star-crossed lovers - though thankfully no fools jumping about. I suppose if I had to go for some weaknesses I'd say the dialogue rarely soars - there's no great wit or incisive interplay. The words follow along with the characters and action but are not a feature of their own.<br /><br />Still, a very pleasing page turner and, thank goodness, something (a bit) innovative in the fantasy genre.sented as culpable vice.

A far cry from Remarque's bleak and horrifying All Quiet on the Western Front, Spike recalls with great fondness the early part of the war - think far more something like a football team or band on tour. This is just training, and whole bunch of young men without much to do given a second chance to muck up at school. Getting drunk, laid, and just farting about - at times literally: get a group of blokes together and, really, is there anything more funny?<br /><br />I didn't laugh as much at it this second time around, but I remember being constantly in hysterics when I first read the series in a few nights back in '85. But Spike can still be trusted for at least a few laugh out loud moments - more if you're in the right mood.	2004-10-06
US	34705979	R7ALYBC4A432R	1857236262	733935310	Inversions	Books	3	11	13	N	N	Clever structure but less compelling than usual	An unusual `Culture' novel, and I wonder if some of the pleasures for the reader have been sacrificed to Banks' ingenious if perhaps less satisfying structure.<br /><br />We have the standard covert interplay between the vastly technologically superior, superlatively `civilised' culture, and backwards societies still mired in greedy, patriarchal and militaristic abuses of human rights. But this time we see it from the perspective of people within the latter society who only have hints of the culture (hints, of course, that resonate far more strongly for those of us who have read other culture novels!).<br /><br />Thus, in one sense if read alone it's not SF at all (despite the differentiating `M.' appearing in the author's name). There's only one (crucial) incident (OK, perhaps two) where the culture is forced to reveal itself, but, as the medieval-type narrator says, he just recounts, and doesn't even begin to speculate. I wonder if someone who hadn't read any other Banks would assume this was a fantasy novel, and that the good Doctor Vossill was actually a sorceress. I think Banks would enjoy this perception, putting the reader in the place of his old world characters.<br /><br />There's plenty of fooling with the narrator, with stories in stories (DeWar's Hiliti and Sechroom, Perrund's incomplete tragic personal history), and Oelph as eye-witness forced to speculate (or not) on incidents he can't explain. Indeed, Banks highlights his teasing of the reader to put together the clues for themselves by interspersing (inverting, if you like) the two inter-related main stories with every second chapter being entitled `The Doctor' or `The Bodyguard'. There is some pleasure in this, but I'm still unsure whether it's too clever for its own good (or perhaps just for *my* own good). My favourite culture novel, The Use of Weapons, likewise leaves the reader to fill in gaps (in that case around an odd non-chronological structure), but I found the individual chapters there more compelling. The climax, too, in both books cleverly forces us to reconsider much that's gone before. Very much a `win' for the ladies, with poor old DeWar, as he's been warned from the start, so busily trying to protect the `Protector' that he loses sight of the bigger game. [Spoiler warning] And just how deep is our missionary-soldier Doctor working: somehow her friends all prosper to the happiest of endings while her foes all die (and often from the sort of poison one with her chemical skills could provide - including the sort applied to Lattens' pacifier) and the realm moves upward to greater welfare and egalitarian government (very Confucian in outlook: get the king straightened out and everything else will come good). I'm not quite so sure why DeWar was so desperate to protect UrLeyn: was the idea for Hiliti and Sechroom to pick one backwater dictator each and see who could drag these peasants towards enlightenment first?<br /><br />There are plenty of standard culture resonances here, hopefully facing the educated and relatively fabulously wealthy 1st world reader with his similar towering relation to those still essentially centuries behind in living standards and freedom in the 3rd world. How do we interact? What are our obligations? What is our best course? Banks doesn't eulogise the noble savage either - his bleak picture of life in a medieval world cries out for rescue for the neglect, abuse and even torture of innocents.<br /><br />So, pertinent themes, likeable characters, clever structure, powerfully surprising and plausible climax ... but I wasn't nearly as drawn in to this story as I am used to with Banks - I felt more distant than usual. Moreover I didn't relish the writing style this time - perhaps because so much of it was done as the character Oelph - although the `Bodyguard' narrative was generally even less gripping. Banks can be good, even great, but I feel this book is more a curiosity for the fans than something I recommend stand alone. Indeed, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who hadn't read some of his other books for fear that on this impression they'd miss out on some really excellent books.stand alone.

And she's done it well. Sure we've got lots of the standard tools around a down and out [illegitimate] child maturing into power and influence, and most characters could be summed up as `Faithful servant #2', `virtuous old mentor', or `Evil priest #3', but what's wrong with that? These are enjoyable mythical characters. Moreover she's managed to maintain a sense of magic as an undercurrent or mood running through the book - something deeper and more powerful than the casual and costless flash of Eddings, Goodkind and their ilk. It reminds me a bit of David Gemmell too in the way that you can like the hero, who looks out for the underdog and is more a friend than a `master': Merlin's a one in a million sage, but a nice bloke too. He's also far more consistent than a lot of heroes whose authors' lavishly describe as paragons of virtue and intellect who don't necessarily do much that's selfless or smart. Stewart's Merlin rather earns our respect and affection - even when involved in the nasty backstabbing at Tintagel (this Arthur had just better be worth it...).<br /><br />So, a capable story from the old romance, a nice place to escape to for a while. I mean, Merlin has a pretty big rap to live up to: it's impressive that you come away from Stewart's version satisfied and not at all disappointed. That'll do me.	2004-09-14
US	34705979	R1QX0GW5UT9U97	0312890729	318023725	King Rat	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Cool dark action and mood, bit pretentious, silly climax	This book reads like a cartoon spin-off movie: it's Batman/X-men/Spiderman (in this case our (tortured disenchanted teen) hero finds he's got super rat powers). It's all about the dark mood. It's very self-consciously visual: at one point Mi&eacute;ville actually describes a scene as looking 'like a page out of a graphic novel'. It almost crosses the line of trying just a bit hard to be cool - and as we all know a definitive thing about cool is that you're NOT trying. OK, it does cross the line with his raptures about 'jungle' as the supreme art form (as opposed to the faddish derivative that it is). But we've got the classic props - troubled rebellious youth telling their elders to stick it, dark, gritty city scenes, gratuitous use of the `f' word, loud music - no sex though, which is a refreshing variation from formula. Although now I think of it, the movies I just mentioned are relatively low on sex too. It feels very cyberpunk even though it's not set in the future: anti-suburban, our hero isn't that heroic (I don't see him using his powers like Superman to set up shop to protect the weak).<br /><br />The ride is gripping enough, if reliant on moderately frequent almost `horror' violence. The characters are not throwaways, but remember this is not a novel based on relationships nearly as much as special FX style action.<br /><br />The climax was really annoying (spoiler warning). I can see why he stuck with it even if the obvious OBVIOUS flaw was screaming at him too. It was perfect for Mi&eacute;ville's purposes to have the piper's discovery of multi-tracking in `Jungle' DJ music as his ultimate weapon: a fantastic new art form grants the siren-manipulator the means of entrancing several species at once - even undoing our heroic hybrid (who is saved, hooray, because he gets down on the bass, baby). He built to this and spun it for all it was worth. Now lets, in no particular order - actually, no, I'll save the most numbingly obvious flaw until last - list the problems here:<br /><br />a) If the piper has always been limited to a single melody through his monophonic instrument, he has always been open to simultaneous attack. At least Mi&eacute;ville anticipates this objection by saying his animals can never take the chance that it will be them who will be targeted in a multiple attack, but there are several places in the book where his birdman, ratman or (his version of) spiderman do place themselves in just such risk. It's not as if Saul makes all the difference - the `animals' are never assured that he's a match for the piper;<br /><br />b) Jungle music is, I'm sure, innovative in some ways, but hardly the first instance of multi-tracking, something that has been used extensively for decades. Recorded music is hardly a recent development, overdubbing likewise;<br /><br />c) Indeed, polyphonic music is not an innovation - try some of that hot-off-the-press Bach. What? Several melodies at once? Inconceivable! OK, sure, piano-accordion could hardly be the instrument of choice for a cool arch-villain ... but as I recall Jimi Hendrix looked pretty inspiring with his guitar (something you can even play polyphonic Bach tunes on if you're John Williams). Simultaneous melody is, like, so (centuries) old...<br /><br />d) Ear plugs (Odysseus picked this a while ago);<br /><br />e) But leaving all these aside, it just gets way too silly to have all these resourceful enemies of the piper pulling out their hair going, \\"Oh no, he's using amplified music! Whatever could we possibly do to overcome that??\\". Um, excuse me, but aren't there just a few ways you could pull out the plug? (Sshhh, don't say that, it'll ruin the whole suspense thing). Nobody even tries to. For goodness sake, you could just throw something heavy at the DAT player, cut through a lead, go outside and pull a fuse, noodle down the street and blow up the local grid. All would seem a wiser course than running towards the piper and away from the ridiculously simple weakness in his obvious weapon.<br /><br />It's just such a stupid hub for the climax to turn on. I mean, fantastic if you ignore the obvious. It reminds me of the equally stupid climax of Die Hard 2, where - to great visual and emotional effect - Bruce Willis lights up the fuel spill of the escaping hoons, blowing up their plane and providing the lighting to enable all the other planes to land. A great finish - as long as you can stop that little voice from saying, \\"Um, why didn't someone think of another way of lighting up the runway before this?\\" Headlights? Flares? Petrol generators? Fires? Dumb, dumb, dumb.<br /><br />Sorry, but this really hurt. Overall the mood is cool and the pages slide by. I realise I'm being a bit elitist with the music references, but the glorification of `jungle' as the be all and end all did make me gag - as if it's the first time anyone's ever discovered the power of bass. There's some definitive immaturity in the way Mi&eacute;ville praises it by saying, \\"It's not Everything But the f-ing Girl\\". Great players in all sorts of styles are often generous in their praise and appreciation of other styles - they can love, say, funk, without having to add, \\"because Classical is boring, and country is stupid, and jazz is pretentious.\\" Part of growing up is realising there's a world outside your tiny sub-culture, and just because something isn't the same as `yours' doesn't make it `wrong'. If the art you love is really good, it's good enough to not be threatened by the existence of other good art. (Disclaimer: this is an overreaction of someone who teaches music to high-schoolers who think anything that hasn't been on video-hits in the last six months must automatically suck.

US	34705979	R3PUDYXFQBMIEG	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	4	9	14	N	N	Able mix of survival story + deceptively persuasive theology	Martel's style is very pleasant to read. He's quite gentle and courteous - even in describing some awful deprivations. You get the feel of being with the gentle and courteous Pi. In the early chapters in the book we are able to enjoy not only his company, but also his recollections of his often idyllic upbringing on his family's business zoo as he came to delight in not only Hinduism, but in Christianity and Islam as well. The voice moves smoothly between narration and oration, with Pi weaving in thought-provoking and wonderfully articulate portions of his perhaps unfashionable personal philosophy.<br /><br />Then the book veers into the extended narrative (or parable?) of Pi's utterly torturous and fabulous ordeal surviving for months at sea in a lifeboat also occupied by a massive Bengal tiger! There's not so much philosophy here - rather it becomes an adventure/survival book, describing, often in some detail, exactly how someone might get through such an extreme situation. It's an impressive feat of imagination - to carry your readers through more than half a book where there is only one setting and one character. And it gets difficult at times: please, Martel, will you let this awful story end and save Pi (and us!). Remember, though, Martel is always thoughtful: before anything turns nasty we already have been reassured, in the most endearing of domestic settings, that `this story has a happy ending'. Part of me is tempted to lend the book to a friend who loves these sort of survival against all odds stories - but I have a feeling he'd feel ripped off that it was fiction, no matter how convincing it sounded. Whatever, it's a gripping and gruelling story.<br /><br />I imagine he got a Booker because a lot of readers, unlike me, felt the conclusion wonderfully tied together the earlier syncretic musings and the incredible tale. However while I think I worked it out, the climax hardly leapt out and slapped me in the face (which is something I really like a novel to do). The crucial lesson comes when insurance men are asked to choose between two stories: an inspiring and unbelievable one with a tiger, and more believable ugly one:<br /><br />\\"I know what you want. You want a story that won't surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won't make you see higher or further or differently. You want a flat story. An immobile story. You want dry, yeastless factuality.\\"<br /><br />\\"Uhh...\\"<br /><br />\\"You want a story without animals.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes!\\"<br /><br />But, of course, that is foolish: there are animals, and they are incredible - it's lying to yourself to blind your eyes to the fantastic. `Incredible' is an excellent word here: a Bengal tiger is utterly `credible' - we know they exist - but at the same time on an emotional/spiritual level ... incredible. Perhaps Martel is challenging the pedestrian world view that, indefensibly, cowardly, denies awe - that doesn't want to admit to the abundant and undeniable spirituality/beauty/truth of, dammit, animals (and people and trees and stars and music and life and the rest of it).<br /><br />In a sense for Martel the vibe, man, is everything. If you can pick it up in a mosque, at a zoo, catching a wave, in the eyes of a child, taking the mass, reading a scripture (any scripture), staring down a microscope ... grab it. Relish it. Flee the `dry, yeastless factuality' of agnostic life, and joyfully claim, `the better story':<br /><br />Words of divine consciousness: moral exaltation; lasting feelings of elevation, elation, joy; a quickening of the moral sense, which strikes one as more important than an intellectual understanding of things; an alignment of the universe along moral lines, not intellectual ones; a realisation that the founding principal of existence is what we call love, which works itself out sometimes not clearly, not cleanly, not immediately, nonetheless ineluctably.<br /><br />At times I've held onto this sort of thing: when some of Jesus' words really sting and you just know they're good - what other grounds do you want? What other grounds will you ultimately get anyway? It's like Keirkegaard's refusal to be an intellectual spectator: for truth to mean anything worthwhile for a human it must touch more than mind - it must be embraced by the whole person. It relates to A'Kempis', \\"I should much rather feel compunction than be able to define it.\\" To Berdyaev's, \\"God is that which cannot be expressed.\\"<br /><br />Yet while Pi is presented as having deep religious convictions, ultimately he holds a staggeringly condescending view of Islam, Hinduism and Christianity (and atheism for that matter). The three straw-men clergy of these faiths are given comic lines when they finally meet - more like the three stooges than three wise men - and laughably blind to their overwhelming similarities outweighing their differences. Ha ha, if only they could overcome their trivial differences ... this really is ugly disrespect. And ignorant - which surprises me in one as well versed as Martel clearly is. Surely he has picked that his blithe mouthing of the absurd populism - that all religions are essentially the same - flies in the face of their core convictions and defining qualities. This book mixes inspired insight with insulting (but ably disguised) stupidity. For all his attacks on agnosticism, he counts as a virtue his refusal to actually take the leap to any particular faith despite crucial ultimately either/or decisions with massively differing lifeshaping (and after-lifeshaping) effects. He doesn't even offer the notion of respecting the integrity of someone with undeniably differing beliefs: no, we're all just trying to `love God' - we really have the same beliefs (what nonsense!).<br /><br />There are some wonderful sound bites in the book, and some eminently quotable and telling passages for people on all sides of the theological fence. It's very readable, often gripping and enjoyable. Even the objections I've raised come more from stepping back from the book or rereading parts - while on the journey Martel is wonderfully (even deceptively) palatable. And very much the right guy for the (shallow) pluralist time.st know they're good - what other grounds do you want? What other grounds will you ultimately get anyway?

Ha ha, if only they could overcome their trivial differences ... this really is ugly disrespect. And ignorant - which surprises me in one as well versed as Martel clearly is. Surely he has picked that his blithe mouthing of the absurd populism - that all religions are essentially the same - flies in the face of their core convictions and defining qualities. This book mixes inspired insight with insulting (but ably disguised) stupidity. For all his attacks on agnosticism, he counts as a virtue his refusal to actually take the leap to any particular faith despite crucial ultimately either/or decisions with massively differing lifeshaping (and after-lifeshaping) effects. He doesn't even offer the notion of respecting the integrity of someone with undeniably differing beliefs: no, we're all just trying to `love God' - we really have the same beliefs (what nonsense!).  <br /> <br />There are some wonderful sound bites in the book, and some eminently quotable and telling passages for people on all sides of the theological fence. It's very readable, often gripping and enjoyable. Even the objections I've raised come more from stepping back from the book or rereading parts - while on the journey Martel is wonderfully (even deceptively) palatable. And very much the right guy for the (shallow) pluralist time.	2004-07-31

I'm not as impressed this time because it's the second `Drenai Tale' I've read - but that being said, I'm not disappointed. The action and mood are as enjoyable as ever, as are the surprisingly frequent almost self-referential asides discussing, &quot;Just what is a hero? Just what makes Druss able to do what he does?&quot; Gemmell likes to have the supporting characters kick this one around. Of course part of it is just the given - he's basically unkillable: you can drop him in the thick of any battle and he'll cut a swathe through whatever factor he's outnumbered by. But there's also the confidence, and the integrity. Druss has his code - basically a knightly `protect the weak' sort of a thing (although he hates riding horses - he's a brawler with an axe who likes a good street fight - not a debonair ponce with a rapier) - and in this book of beginnings we meet his mentor and find out some family history.<br /><br /> The book is celebrating a genre - it doesn't hope to `escape' its confines - which is a strength and weakness. There's no great comedy, or really sharp dialogue, or penetrating social commentary. The characters are deliberately larger than life: this is heroic fantasy, pure and simple, and Gemmell has the sense not to try to add some other possible dimensions outside his scope. But the book integrates everything within its own world strongly, even in most cases the magic. This is often a let down for fantasy writers: in wanting to give their wizards amazing powers it often becomes absurd to think that anything can actually threaten them. And that's what I like about Gemmell - without necessarily soaring, he doesn't generally get anything wrong. So the magical characters generally have limited ability, and the occasional sojourn Druss has into the netherworld don't contradict the rest of the suspense.<br /><br /> However here he makes an unusually ugly clanger, casually granting his Source (was that `the Force', no, sorry, `the Source') priest the power to astrally travel anywhere on the globe - and then remotely, for example, cure the microscopic cancer cells he can examine in anyone while outside his body. Uh, OK, that's nice ... but then we're supposed to swallow that this same priest needs Druss to go and kill the guy driven mad by the demon he's encountered by taking possession of Druss' old axe. Even if the reader grants Gemmell the benefit of the doubt, perhaps reasoning for him that the priest couldn't metaphysically get past the demon, it makes no sense that this same priest left his emissary starved and languishing in a dungeon. Moreover he's supposed to be pretty compassionate, yet we get no suggestion that he methodically (even passionately) uses his godlike powers to aid the poor and suffering and overcome evil. And it's not that he's taken a vow of non-violence: he has no qualms about commissioning - even forcing - an assassination, and is chastised by his Abbott for not keeping up his sword skills. For such a character who hates the work of murderers, pirates, rapists and the like it's absurd that he then stands by and seems to do nothing in the world to defeat perpetrators he could enfeeble or kill with ease.<br /><br /> Still he's a relatively minor character (and flaw) in an otherwise satisfying collection of four episodes in Druss' heroic life.he power to astrally travel anywhere on the globe - and then remotely, for example, cure the microscopic cancer cells he can examine in anyone while outside his body.

US	34705979	R3NOWT4313WK7K	0140294325	899749823	Sharpe's Company (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #13)	Books	3	8	12	N	N	Authentic setting, gripping action, panto characters	Cornwall is obviously a military history buff, relishing the dates, companies, weapons, troop movements, locations, battles etc. of the period. If you're into that sort of thing, go hard. Moreover we're drenched in action - this is centred on major battles. And the action carries you along; the page-turning managed to keep me up to knock the book over in a few nights. In his following `historical note' Cornwall owns up to where he's bent things a little for the sake of his story:<br />&quot;Purists will also be offended that Sharpe attacked Ciudad Rodrigo with the Third Division, and Badajoz with the Fourth, but it is the fate of fictional soldiers to be always where the fight is thickest even when that means a cavalier disregard for the make-up of divisions.&quot;<br />This reminds me of Patrick O'Brian, who I believe said that all the things that happen to his 18th Century RN hero did actually happen - but never to the same man. Books like these can be a far more enjoyable way of learning a bit of history, and both writers are prepared to paint some of the less admirable sides of `their' heroes and `their' army (who both go berserk in Sharpe's Company, butchering surrendering French soldiers once they've breached the wall at Badajoz).<br />Comparing the two military historical writers any further, however, can only put Cornwall in the shade. While Cornwall could contend that he's giving an accurate soldier's eye view - grim, ruthless - I found his characters one dimensional, something you couldn't say of O'Brian's Marturin or Aubrey. Indeed, Sharpe's right hand man Harper is barely even a cardboard invention: little John has simply changed his uniform, accent and century. O'Brian's characters often surprised me: it felt like the author had some insight into the journals and accounts he'd read from another age. Once I'd had their opening description Cornwall's characters never did - I felt more like I was reading someone who'd seen a lot of mid-day black and white movies (witness, for example, his massively stereotyped image of the coarse working class army wives). His heroine and his villain could have stepped out of pantomime.<br />For a purportedly historical novel this book is awash with melodramatic fictional conventions - and that bugs me more than if it were, say, thrown into an SF context based on the same historical events. I'd feel far less compelled to judge his W.E. Johns attitude to the largely faceless enemy or the glory of battle. Of course every book is contrived, but this feels so contrived (as opposed to crafted) - Sharpe will suffer several losses (no fault of his own) early in the book so that his eventual inevitable victory will taste all the sweeter. OK, OK, likewise Jack Aubrey, but there's so much else happening along the way. The devotion of Sharpe's men to their dashing leader feels so much more Hollywood than history, as, of course, his charmed ability to stand in a spray of bullets that can only ever touch the minor characters standing around him.<br />Maybe you could put aside the pretentions of authenticity (of character, not dates, events and places) and just enjoy the well researched settings and brutal victories. However even with some pretty generous suspension of disbelief parameters Cornwall's fairly central plot around the villainous Hawkeswill is internally stupid. A deranged (yet cunning) serial rapist-murderer, Sharpe's nemesis, who in previous books has given Sharpe overwhelming personal motivations to kill. Early in the book he gives us one more - he corners Sharpe's lover and attempts to rape and kill her. Sharpe and little John step in mid-attack and overpower him. Hawkeswill sternly vows his intention to rape and kill her at the earliest opportunity. Sharpe's assassin girlfriend offers to kill him. Harper begs for the task. Sharpe - who's bread and butter is killing - says he wants to kill him. Yet ... like those who oppose Batman and James Bond, for some reason these seasoned executioners inexplicably can't bring themselves to simply fire a round or insert a knife. Sharpe's reasoning, \\"I want to do it publicly,\\" out of some sort of supposedly noble desire to thereby purge the evil Hawkeswill has visited on so many - is nothing short of ridiculous. The result is that Hawkeswill is simply turned free - by the hero - to torture, rape and kill more innocents and provide suspense. In order to set up the climax of Sharpe having to win the race past the walls of Badajoz to rescue his defacto wife and child from the lurking killer/rapist, Cornwall expects his readers to have his supposedly super-resourceful hero blithely let him walk around untouched - without even bothering to attempt to kill him. It's far worse than the insufferably procrastinating Hamlet, as Sharpe is supposed to be an unusually able plotter and killer. This absurd contradiction bugged me (did you pick that?), and got more and more stupid as the book went on - to the supreme stupidity of Hawkeswill getting away yet again (from three armed experienced killers in the one room) to lurk about in the next novel! Hawkeswill, in contrast, actually had the intelligence to know who his enemies were, to carefully observe them and take rational and devious measures to bring them down (such as the not uncommon fragging. That being said, it is also stupid that Hawkeswill's never been fragged).<br /><br />OK, sure, if Cornwall was wanting to write cartoon farce (\\"Next time, Gadget, next time\\"; \\"Ah, Von-Stalhein - we meet again\\"), this is acceptable, nay, expected. But hard-bitten, carefully researched historical fiction? Only as hard bitten as Georgette Heyer. He doesn't have to write something as bleak as All Quiet on the Western Front, but he should at least be informed by it. Alternatively he could write `historical fiction' like Alexandre Dumas, where the characters are deliberately far larger than life and we can relish the greater emphasis on the `fiction' without the troubling demands of trying to be essentially `historical' within precisely documented specific events.cutioners inexplicably can't bring themselves to simply fire a round or insert a knife.

US	34705979	R12LMW8GP3U3XI	0375727051	285239995	Creation: A Novel	Books	4	10	18	N	N	5th C. BC celebs. Scholarly, able, but hardly a page-turner	As Vidal says in his introduction to this edition,<br />'If nothing else, this narrative is a sort of crash course in comparative religion and ethical systems...'<br />Although he's a Zoroastrian, our autobiographical narrator Cyrus Spitama generally represents the Judeo-Christian linear view - that we each live once and will meet the monotheistic `Wise Lord' to be judged when we die. To take us beyond a dry text book analysis, Vidal has run with the enticing possibility of someone living in an age where he could have actually met, among others, Socrates, the Buddha and Confucius. So Vidal has Cyrus, for example, in dialogue with the latter two.<br />Vidal has done his background reading so the conversations are informative, and more palatable than much of the texts he would have gleaned his material from (that being said, you can knock over Confucius' very readable Analects in a couple of hours yourself and be that much closer to the source). Moreover there's the pleasure of the fictional (but believable) characters he's created around the history and teaching.<br />Still, if that's why you're reading the book, you'd be better off skipping all but about fifty pages of this door-stopping 700 pager. Vidal patiently or,depending on your perspective, indulgently devotes most of the book to evoking possible versions of historical people and settings in Persia, Greece, India and China in the fifth century B.C. I suspect this would be particularly enjoyable (or inflammatory) for readers who have recently been working with sources such as Herodotus, as Vidal's Spitama is consciously set up as an alternative voice. However, if, like myself, the various famous `-ocleses' that fly by are barely more than recognisable names, Vidal's speculations aren't that arresting; if you were reading this book purely as a fiction you'd wonder why this parade of minor characters are given stage time - the cameos only work if you're aware of the celebrity already.<br />And that's a significant point - would this book be a worthy read if the faces weren't so famous?<br />Well, it's not a labour to read. Vidal is an able writer, Spitama is an engaging character with interesting alternate values to our popular ones, and his commentary on other views of his time are stimulating. However I doubt that I could recommend the book to anyone without a prior interest in and knowledge of a significant portion of the history, philosophy and religion that it engages with. Politicians and kings take up a major part of the narratives, but these are the recollections of a cynical old man, and more often summaries rather than developed relationships. We don't really have a lot of affection for most of the sketched characters - partly because there are just so many of them. Spitama himself generally consciously distances himself from those around him. He has friendships, but, perhaps just in the way that they are narrated, they rarely involve our emotions over our mind.<br />This is doubly so for the action. Cyrus describes the often dangerous and violent times and places he's lived through, but there is not a moment of suspense or drama. For example he drolly skips over his life-threatening adventure in having to follow a caravan through a dangerous and unfamiliar exotic foreign land, avoiding bandits and a ruthless pursuing police/military force for several days. Lois L'amour would spun out that week into an entire thrilling novel: Vidal reduces it to a throwaway sentence. Sure, Vidal is never trying to write a thriller, however I do think it's a weakness that when undeniably gripping events turn up he can't narrate them in a way that brings out the extreme emotions that would have been there at the time.<br />A telling fact is that while I read this book, in between times I read four others. This is unusual for me: I'm normally pretty faithful to the one text as I go through it - however the other books I happened to come across along the way (e.g. a Douglas Adams, aDavid Lodge) immediately got me in, and when I went to pick up a book I wanted to read the others, but I could take or leave Creation. It was the choice between an undeniably scholarly piece OR something that would make me laugh and/or feel driven to find out what happened in the next chapter. The two don't have to be mutually exclusive, so, yes, I suppose that's my essential reservation about a very capable and interesting book.s, a David Lodge) immediately got me in, and when I went to pick up a book I wanted to read the others, but I could take or leave Creation.

Wodehouse to write a Dr. Who script you might come up with something like this. Why not? Apparently as well as script editing for series 17 (featuring, for example, 'City of Death' where John Cleese is an art dealer), Adams wrote a couple of episodes ('The Pirate Planet', and the unfinished 'Shada' which featured none other than Prof. 'Reg' Chronitis and his TARDIS style study). Sorry, enough trainspotting (thanks G &amp; J).<br />The Dr. Who thing only hit me late in the book, but that's partly because 'Dirk Gently' only pops up about half way through, and he's most enjoyably reminiscent of Tom Baker in his distracted purposefulness. I suppose there's something of Ford Prefect there too, and other elements of Hitch Hikers - yet another confused alien species looking to earth as an Eden and changing the deep past and whole evolution of humanity. And I suppose Richard could be played by whoever was DentArthurDent in the TV show.<br />But, hey, this isn't having a go at the book, which is sheer pleasure to read. It's not at all a cheap carbon of earlier Adams, there's just some lovely echoes. The guy just writes so wonderfully - like Wodehouse - and the dialogue is full of good (frightfully British) humour and character. Moreover the comic observations on the everyday are clever and flawlessly executed. The setting is surprisingly coherent when you get down to it (I *love* the way he casually resolves the sofa paradox that's been running through the whole book) - there's really nothing I can think of to complain about with it. I'm used to books lifting me up and then disappointing, but this manages to ebulliently float you along from start to finish.<br />I'm so glad I decided to start rereading books. It must be over a decade since I'd read this and I only had the vaguest recollection of some of the key images. But the chief pleasure of Adams can't be reduced to, say, the plot line, which, while fine, is in one way incidental (i.e. the characters and dialogue are good enough to stand alone). I get the impression he was in a fairly positive state of mind when he wrote this (as opposed to Mostly Harmless), and in excellent form, so these character's are simply pleasant to be with - as well as being hilarious and - as with those of Pratchett on a good day - charming.nd dialogue are good enough to stand alone).

Primarily the way that he lets awful things sometimes happen to good characters he's developed (like disability or death) - you really didn't know what was going to happen. He also was developing some very interesting deeper structures outside the basic warring noble families. The second novel keeps that going, but it seems like at times he's just casting dice to decide on plot lines. It may be he (rightly) feels his world and characters are robust enough to cope with such haphazard treatment, and that it reflects the context of the massive uncertainty of a civil war - but some sort of direction is enjoyable in a novel. The larger things are still there (the mysterious atrocities rising beyond the wall; the return of magic with Danerys and her dragons), but there's not much of a sense of a deadline with them.<br />In one way this may be good - you can just enjoy the interaction of substantial characters in a coherent fantasy world without it being forced into a typical exposition-rising tension-climax-d&eacute;nouement structure. But I didn't enjoy it as much because the first did always seem to be more clearly going somewhere. Furthermore, while this is recounting the descent into treacherous conflict, the sheer volume and ubiquity of sickeningly brutal murder, molestation and mutilation of innocents is a bit overwhelming. George, are you just getting a little too much pleasure out of all this? I mean, it's your world and your narrative - you don't have to linger quite so long or often over these accounts. Or you could even pick things up a little!<br />I hope he doesn't go too Orson Scott Card, but there are getting to be a few too many world/era changing characters.

US	34705979	R3R5OYJ57GSPTR	1592220053	994399065	Tuf Voyaging	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Imperfect, but one good thriller and some fascinating themes	The half dozen short stories centre on Haviland Tuf, a fastidious, pompous, somewhat misanthropic character, who outsmarts his foes, and appears to be the only person with integrity in the whole universe. The superior prequel story describes how he gained possession of an ancient but technologically massively advanced juggernaut - its most crucial capacity is genetics. Tuf can create virtually any species he wants - from devastating viruses to gentle cute grass-eaters to beasts of nightmare.<br /> <br />The story that started this collection (all written for Analog) probably came from the old notion that the technology we have now would make past cultures view us as God/s. In `Call Him Moses', Martin sets up a self-styled prophet who takes over a planet by (secretly non-miraculously) reproducing most of the plagues of Exodus - the executive hand over office under threat of the first born`plague'.<br /> <br />Our `hero' deliberately appears to this dictator as a pillar of light, saying I am the Lord God. With his far greater technology he displaces the `false prophet'. Martin pushes this pretty hard, having his (not ironic or undermined) protagonist sincerely say for all intents and purposes in this case he is God because of the planet altering powers his ship gives him.<br /> <br />The same theme is explored in `Manna from Heaven', written seven years later. Faced with an absurdly overpopulated planet which, after every chance to work on birth control (something their religion abhors), is descending into anarchy and expansionist warfare, Tuf devises a plant that will essentially sterilise 99% of the population.<br />\\"You have no right,\\" declares the (straw woman) president of the planet. \\"...Who the hell gave you the authority to make that decision for them? ... You're no better than we are. You're only human ... What gives you the goddamned right to play God with our world and our lives?\\"<br /> <br />...\\"I make no claims to godhead in the mythological sense, \\" [replies Tuf,] \\"Yet I submit that I do indeed wield the power of a god...I traffic in the life and death of worlds. Enjoying as I do these godlike abilities, can I rightfully decline the accompanying responsibility, the equally awesome burden of moral authority? I think not.\\"<br /> <br />Normally such a declaration would have the reader saying with Tuf's antagonist, \\"He's insane.\\" But Martin is pushing us to think a little deeper. A cool theme that emerges is that we should recognise our responsibility rather than just act as if it doesn't exist. Learning to be comfortable with the power we have is actually admirable. It'd be great if he wrote something about this relating to the responsibility we in the `1st world' automatically have to the `3rd world' - with every purchase we make.<br /> <br />Tuf persuades the president with the analogy of the way he sterilised his cats:<br />\\"... Ultimately, as you yourself will discover, there are but two fundamental options. You must either reconcile yourself to inhibiting the fertility of your cats, entirely without their consent, I might add, or, failing that, some day most assuredly you will find yourself about to cycle a bag full of newborn kittens out your airlock into the cold vacuum of space. Make no choice, and you have chosen. Failure to decide, because you lack the right, is itself a decision, First Councillor. In abstaining, you vote.\\"<br /> <br />\\"Tuf,\\" she said, her voice agonised, \\"don't! I don't want this damned power.\\"<br /> <br />I can see in this why he deals so well with the nature of kingship in his, `Song of Ice and Fire' series, particularly Danerys. Also putting the power thing into this context doesn't offend my sensibilities as a Christian who actually does think God is not merely a myth, and all believers fools and/or manipulative liars.<br /> <br />While these two stories are easily the most challenging thematically, they don't really set the tone for the book. Interesting that the first story written, `Call Him Moses', comes second last. The earlier ones are all prequels, most written seven years later in `85. The longest and most enjoyable, `The Plague Star', is simply a thriller - Tuf has to kill or be killed by the individuals in the landing party attempting to claim the valuable ship. We then have novel accounts of how Tuf deals with the ecological problems of various planets.<br /> <br />There is another theme: despite him solving massive problems, his solutions are generally resented by those he rescues, and his motives always unjustly impugned (projection). This may be Martin deliberately setting him up for godhood, rightly seeing that justice from above, even in response to calls for help, often just results in rank ingratitude and abuse.<br /> <br />A weakness, however, is that no other character is given the sense or personality to actually appreciate or even understand Tuf's actions. Because some of these actions are so clearly helpful, this means everyone else is either stupid and/or ugly, or inconsistent. Tuf's eccentricities and virtue could have been much more enjoyable if he'd had at least some sympathetic characters - his precious cats aren't enough for me.last.

Zindell has a brain, creativity, and some knowledge to bring to a story. Also pretty wild that the SF style blockbuster has as its hero a guy sworn to non-violence: how do you give your readers their usual satisfaction of righteous biff? But (in this first book of the series anyway) to his credit Zindell sticks with it: our hero Danlo remains far more like Hesse's Siddharta than 99% of the protagonists of anything else in this genre. It is fascinating to see how he paints strong non-violent innocence interacting with diabolical cruelty.<br />Moreover, the nature of Zindell's universe and traversing it reminds me of A Fire Upon the Deep, as does his impressive alternate sentient species - and these are the strengths of Vinge's clever book. For mine the most enjoyable of the relationships of The Broken God was that between Danlo and his Fravashi `Old Father' philosophical teacher (echoes of John Guilgud or Yoda aside).<br />Like a thousand others Zindell is a massively ambitious writer - he claims superlative, era-moulding characters. However unlike most he doesn't merely expect us to take his word for it that they really are supermen: like Orson Scott Card he actually attempts to convince us by their words and actions. Now given that Danlo is supposed to be the ultimate noble savage, precocious sage, and Buddha-like enlightened one able to really grasp every world view in the universe, it's commendable that Zindell doesn't utterly fail. He really does make an effort to engage with various theologies and philosophies - to the point that surely some readers will be going, \\"C'mon, can we at least have some light-sabres already!\\" The metaphysics, instead of being cursory and/or vague, have a few thousand words flung at them, not all of which are flapdoodle.<br />Unfortunately, however, while he comes up with some fascinating ideas for potential new cults and philosophies, and shows some understanding of present ones, his hubris in this incredibly presumptuous work is ultimately absurd and juvenile. We are expected to take Danlo utterly seriously when he basically says, \\"Well, science has its good points, but it really has missed `x'. Oh, Buddhism is pretty neat, but its basic flaw is `y'. Philosophy has something going for it, but what it doesn't catch onto is `z'.\\" And so on. It really is quite staggering, however, just how popular this sort of arrogant nonsense is - and as such enormously palatable to so many readers. To be just a bit more inflammatory, if you do find yourself nodding sagely with such absurd aphorisms as, \\"Well, all religions are basically the same, you know,\\" and, \\"Philosophy doesn't address where people really are as whole emotional and spiritual beings,\\" you should realise this is really like saying, \\"Well, religions are all basically the same you know (or, at least, the one I heard about was)\\", or \\"I know I haven't actually read any Locke, Derrida, Anselm or Aristotle, but I'm sure they were essentially mistaken.\\"<br />At some point we should wake up to the fact that it isn't really plausible for us to claim (particularly without having even looked at most of the endless list of them) that we simply know better than Milton, Newton, Plato, Jesus, Descartes, Einstein, Keirkegaard, Moses, Confucius, Pascal, Seneca, Freud ... just keep inserting names. It's not enough for me that Danlo simply is this wild supremely gifted being, and even though he has a bit of a go, Zindell doesn't seriously begin to contend with any of the several world views he dismisses.<br />Moreover, his technique of vehemently condemning organised religion is embarrassingly obvious and ridiculous. Sure, I could handle some incisive comment on the way that ritual and tradition in organised religions can often run completely against the teachings and aims of the very saints and enlightened ones that these rituals are supposed to bring the flock closer to: Jesus railed against the Pharisees knowing scripture only in order to twist it to their own ends; Confucius despaired at rituals reduced to mere clanging of bells. Zindell, in one of his many inserted lectures (we have an omnipotent narrator who not infrequently pops in to tell us what we should be thinking), does make some salient points along this line. However, rather than leaving it at some well pointed criticisms (or, perish the thought, acknowledging some decent counter-arguments), he goes on to construct a silly and venomous over the top straw man attack.<br />Did you catch that all the organised religions in The Broken God are run by madmen of the insane depravity to either destroy stars, introduce epic genocidal plagues, or revel in torture? Hitler? Stalin? They may not have been church leaders, but they've got nothing on Hanuman or the Architects. Oh, and anyone who follows these teachings is literally lobotomised to become docile and pliant!<br />Sure, the inside of your local church or mosque might not be entirely populated by passionate, independent geniuses, but I dare say if you popped in and got to know a few of them they might not all be the mindless sheep they're painted as. And, again, why is it blind ignorance if some Christians say that followers of Islam are falsely indoctrinated, but OK if humanists or alternate spiritualists say all believers are mindless victims of cunning manipulation. If Zindell wrote a book painting Jews or blacks the way he's painted members of organised religion, he'd probably be in danger of prosecution under some state's vilification laws. But some targets are not protected, eh.<br />A pity, Zindell has some great ideas, and I can see (particularly) why someone like Card is sympathetic and praises his writing. I relished some of the earlier parts of the book and felt pleased to have found another good writer.

US	34705979	R1KI5WL8OOKNFR	0671703498	296654360	Second Skin	Books	2	2	8	N	N	OK action novel with absurd philosophical pretensions	Eric's a bit like Kevin Kline's Fish Called Wanda, \\"Don't call me stupid\\" character. He's desperate to impress us by showing he's read some Nietzsche, and can spell both his and Goethe's names (probably better than I can), but someone needs to remind him that the central message of Buddhism is not `every man for himself'. He does, for example, just get deconstruction wrong, and tries to portray a nun as a seriously devout believer who has no concept of an afterlife. He tries to give his standard action novel (with formula use of seedy sexual background, plus some eastern mysticism thrown in) the pretence of profundity: difficult when, poor soul, he can't actually conceive of anything more impressive than having a lot of money and being able to punch out, spiritually or physically, any comers. Think of Simon the sorcerer trying to buy a slice of the Holy Spirit. Even his `enlightened' characters are as driven by materialism as the bad guys, they just aren't (quite) so arbitrarily bloodthirsty. Oh, and they do stupid things, despite purported intelligence.<br /> <br />If, however, you can ignore the deep contradictions, just enjoy the vibe of the trash spirituality/philosophy and take the ride of standard thriller characters and violence, sure, Lustbader will take you along.	2004-05-20

Books	3	16	17	N	N	Less substance, more cheap stylistic and prurient tricks	Here Lodge uses so many standard tricks that you could almost say he was parodying himself: university setting (Small World, Nice Work, Changing Places); a writer as persona (Therapy); parodying other writers (The British Museum Is Falling Down); an incorporated lecture (everything) - this time on consciousness, particularly as it relates to cognitive science and AI; altering perspectives (Therapy); altering styles (Changing Places, How Far Can You Go), particularly diarising (Paradise News, Therapy), lapsed Catholics (several), explaining/defending his writing technique to the reader as part of the text (most overtly in How Far Can You Go), oh, and, of course, fornication and/or adultery (everything). Maybe it's a conscious thing and trainspotters like myself are supposed to pick the deliberate references to all his other novels along the way: Robyn Penrose drops in; Keirkegaard is mentioned; Catholic birth control gets a cameo (although that's pretty endemic) etc.<br /> <br />As ever he's researched his topic thoroughly and made it palatable. There are passages of his bravely incisive honesty - as when he really gets down to the bones of what Helen (his lapsed catholic novelist/academic lead character) wanted out of her children's catholic education: a mild and conveniently temporary faith, and enough bible knowledge to appreciate such a rich store of literary allusion - something she probably couldn't admit to herself at the time. His settings generally feel authentic - he has the sense to depict the sort of places he's actually been, or to get good advice. Moreover his novels are tailor made to be discussed: glancing at the opening paragraph in this review, give me 2500 words on similarities and differences in this and any other of his books; here he gives Helen some perfect lines to lift to explain why a novelist (himself) would construct a book in a certain way. There are many pleasures in reading him.<br /> <br />That being said, however, the novel as a whole felt a bit hollow. I suspect its greatest weakness is the great morass of sex and talk about sex that you have to trawl through along the way. Extra-marital sex isn't quite the utter redemption/salvation it is of Out of the Shelter, Therapy and Paradise News - for a change bonking is not the climax and unequivocally happy resolution - and while Helen's affair does initially appear to do her a power of good, there's no future in it, and she actually begins to look quite foolish. However there are just too many pages devoted to the bedroom for Lodge to be merely offering mature analysis of an interesting topic without being overly coy. At some point it becomes gratuitous, just as Tom Clancy will gratuitously throw in car chases and flying bullets to distract us from his lack of insight. It's not quite erotic literature, but it's definitely voyeuristic - sort of a gossip novel, not getting carried away with detailing pulsating members and the like, but relishing just who's doing what to whom for just a bit too long and a bit too frequently.<br /> <br />And I really thought Lodge would be over this by now - I'm reminded of the fool chiding King Lear, something about how he couldn't be old because he's clearly not yet wise. When is he going to get this sex thing into perspective? It's not nothing, but it's not everything either. A while ago Lodge did pick that his local bishop may not have had all the answers, but doesn't appear to have lost faith in the philosophy of something as juvenile (and stupid) as Pretty Woman. The writer of Ecclesiastes gave it a fair burl, but did eventually work out that among other things sex wasn't the ultimate place to find meaning.<br />Lodge does at least seem to be self-aware enough to realise that sex does seem to dominate the book to an obsessive degree so, through mouthpiece Helen, he offers a defence. When she is questioned about the sex in *her* novels she explains that of course the frequency and deviancy is exaggerated, but more standard monogamous relationships just aren't interesting enough for the reader. This lame defence really isn't worthy of a writer who:<br />a)       has the skills to write about a range of issues, characters and experience without needing to fall back on titillation - as if it's the only possible subject that can sustain interest (he might as well endorse Clancy as writing the only readable fiction - readers can't cope unless there's a bomb about to go off somewhere and some macho posturing and biffo every few pages);<br />b)       has literally read thousands of good novels where titillation isn't used at all;<br />c)       has read myriad others that don't shy away for a moment from dealing powerfully with issues of fidelity and sexuality, without crossing the line into prurience (Lodge, in contrast, rushes over the line and can only manage to drift back again now and then). <br /> <br />The irony for me (and I suspect many others) is that what is inadequately explained as a concession to entertain readers actually makes the novel more tedious. I don't read Lodge for seedy revelations, and I suppose if that was what I was after I could find better elsewhere anyway. He can write with passion, humour, insight and wit - but you have to endure a lot of other stuff to get there in this book.<br /> <br />So, a bit of a blast for one of my favourite writers - I'm more aggrieved I suppose because I hope for more - definitely more than just playing with styles almost as a student exercise and thinking lashings of sex can cover paucity of substance.ard monogamous relationships just aren't interesting enough for the reader.

His style reminds me a bit of Hornby (maybe I've got that backwards), the honesty I suppose. I relate particularly to his persona's reminiscences about his first girlfriend - how blithely horrible you can be. I don't think he needed to tie things up with a common technique of his (sex: cf. Out of the Shelter; Nice Work, Paradise News): it seems to be important to him to show how he's overcome his teenage Catholic morals, and he falls back on restoration bedroom farce perhaps cheaply.<br /> <br />Again he's wise to stick to areas he knows about - scenes from Television, Publishing - and from a Catholic Youth Group. He also ties in all this stuff about Keirkegaard - someone who hardly lends himself to a popular novel. He has to work hard to make it fit, but does so. I like his line about Keirkegaard being like flying through clouds: occasionally they clear and you have a moment of intense and profound clarity ... and then suddenly you're plunged back into utter obscurity.	2004-05-17
US	34705979	R3O8HU7EMHHSPR	0670842281	472314295	Paradise News	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Funny, touching, insightful, morally & thematically flawed	Again Lodge does a great job, weaving (this time) a holiday he must have had to Hawaii (and justifiably a working one!), and his interest in theology into his standard redemption through fornication plot. I was struck by the total opposite theme to that of [[ASIN:B003F76K36 The Seville Communion]]: for P&eacute;rez-Reverte the priest's seduction is his downfall, his loss of identity and strength; for Lodge it is the (ex) priest's enlightenment and liberation.<br /><br />There's also that tradition (back to Wodehouse? Henry James? Even John Cleese) of the inhibited Englishman looking to the fresh and open American to free him. Indeed, the US lover is almost like a Greek chorus, blithely stepping in with all the answers.<br /><br />As in Therapy the persona is self-consciously narrating himself, but not to be undermined: he's meant to appear pretty self-aware. There's also Lodge's signature toying with other genres and perspectives: diary, postcards, letters.<br /><br />He is deliberately writing a comedy, so he can't leave Bernard in his lonely disenchanted state, but in [[ASIN:0099554143 How Far Can You Go?]] he managed to present pros and cons of several different perspectives (although even there the priest's hope is in loss of faith and leaving the church), while here he makes it out to be simple: the one essential to happiness is having a good sex life. I get the impression that Lodge partly unconsciously resents the `wait until lifelong monogamy/marriage' value he was brought up with, perhaps feeling he missed out on lashings of great sex, and had much of his earlier contacts marred by guilt and ignorance due to it having to be hidden. I dare say in some ways he has a point, but it's naïve of him to presume that promiscuity is necessarily better.<br /><br />This line that Bernard (once he's lost his faith and is getting some) `has come a long way from being a thurible bearer at Our Lady of Perpetual Succour' is an unfair dismissal of anyone who has ever stayed with the church, as if they are automatically immature and ignorant. Sure, some are - but are we to say that, for example, Jesus was without insight because he was celibate? Moreover it misses the observation of Ecclesiastes: that sex, among other things, will not ultimately satisfy. Not to mention that there are some immature and ignorant people that are getting laid.<br /><br />There is a hint of some awareness of this when Bernard muses earlier in the novel that if leaving the church was meant to be such a wonderful emancipation, then why has it left him directionless and despairing. But later we find it's just because he hasn't been having good sex. I like the way that in [[ASIN:1573225517 High Fidelity]] Hornby turns this around, pointing out some of the weaknesses and immaturity in the contemporary opposition to monogamy.<br /><br />Has Lodge never met a wise believer? He even discounts the myriad Christians he has read so much more of than me in the Western literary tradition. In his concluding lecture on contemporary theology, a helpful and concise summary (albeit something deeply flawed, particularly his wildly erroneous rendering of Jesus' sheep and goats analogy), he seems to assume that spiritual insight works in exactly the same way as technological research or popularity: anyone from any age who believed in a literal heaven or hell (simpletons like Jesus, St. Paul, John Donne, Keirkegaard - Lodge could name so many more than I could if he wanted to) is blithely dismissed, just as one might dismiss some ancient's ill-informed speculations on astronomy. The argument is simply: `most popular theologians today believe...'. Much as this is a significant fact, spiritual and moral matters don't work to the same empirical testing: you might as well say the Spice Girls have more insight into character than Ben Jonson, because they were born later and shift more units annually.<br /><br />Lodge, through Bernard, doesn't justify disbelief in hell, merely assumesit as a sophisticated, informed stance. He's particularly arrogant in quoting something from, I think, T.S. Elliot, saying its ironic that the `best' people tend to be inactive, but the `worst' (extremists, fundamentalists) are all too active. This one isn't too hard to challenge: it's an intellectual saying to other intellectuals that people like himself are the best because they sit around discussing things interminably but never seem to actually do anything. It might show a little more honesty to say that part of being one of the `best' people would include your record of passionate action. It only seems to be these weirdo extremists that are blowing up buildings (or, ahem, tending lepers) - and c'mon, it doesn't take too much insight to realise that weirdo extremists don't just happen - even the terrorist ones - but there but for the grace of God go I: if someone starts bombing your home town and you do anything about it, you'll be defined as a weirdo extremist by armchair intellectuals in other parts of the world.<br /><br />Is it that Lodge knows all this but was fitting to the conventions of comedy - he has to have a simple happy resolution, I shouldn't carp at him for it? (I'm about to give a glowing review to a Wodehouse book, but am hardly faulting him for a ridiculous barrage of marriages) No, he's the one who raised a lot of these issues and he is pushing a point - that's part of his attraction: he gives you a lot more to think about than Wodehouse, and he's generally a honest and insightful writer (here I am panning him, when he has more perceptive thoughts over breakfast than I do in a year). However I do think he's denying the existence of any evangelical with half a brain, and I don't think, given the information available to him, that's justified.a sophisticated, informed stance.

US	34705979	R1DM7DL2MWCBB4	0451457765	446908784	Tigana: Anniversary Edition	Books	3	20	30	N	N	OK world/plot, windy sentimental adolescescent style	This book avoids many of the common errors of the ubiquitous epic fantasy genre, most particularly in plotting. Moreover the basic world structure is pretty coherent, and, unlike Goodkind for example, he doesn't lazily and randomly introduce new characters/creatures with no attempt to make sense of them in the history of the place. The climax is not the usual anti-climactic afterthought where we've all known exactly what was going to happen since about page 30: we still know the goodies are going to triumph, but the action feels like it could go a few different directions right to the wire. And when he is writing action, Kay can do it well: the dramatic events of the vigil over Sandre's funeral, for example. And thank goodness it's a single (if 700 page) book.<br />However...<br />There is actually surprisingly little action in this book of sensational events. Rather we get indulgent pages trying unsuccessfully to persuade us of just how noble or wise or fascinating our basically one-dimensional characters are. Nowhere is this more painful than in the consistently tedious Dianora. Just telling us (in oh so many words) that someone is the cleverest of manipulative wives, and/or a tortured soul won over by the powerful charms of her enemy, doesn't make it so. Dianora says or does nothing to convince us of her diplomacy, and Brandon likewise does nothing to make us even sympathetic to why she would fall for him. Kay could say it was just the sexual electricity between them, but some writers can actually write some dialogue that creates this impression. There really is a lot of, \\"this king, right, he's really noble and wise, and his right hand man, like, he's so clever and incisive, whereas this girl, she's really intelligent\\" - with very little noble, wise, clever, incisive or intelligent being said or done. Whole chapters read almost like explanations of the book Kay would like to have written - while the actual characters and narrative fall way short. I might have forgiven him this if he had've carried me along with action, but when you get down to it there are a lot of pages where nothing much actually happens.<br />Instead you might get the sort of bizarrely common cross between blushing teenage romance and James Bond womanising farce. The boys and girls in the story interact with stammering coyness and at times nauseating sentimentality (eg. with Rovigo's family), yet these are meant to be hard bitten, sexually experienced, guerrilla killers. We pause for absurd group hugs (\\"I love you guys,\\" - very David Eddings) and fantasy one night stands as the odd nympho just happens to pop by. We're supposed to even take the `keep `em happy' occasional titillation seriously, but the perspective is overwhelmingly adolescent. It doesn't get totally pornographic, more it's got the feel of a nerdy kid trying to act knowing, \\"Yeah, sure, I've done it, man, f'waaaaar\\" (think of Arnold Rimmer's \\"I gave her one!\\"). Likewise the frequent attempts to sound cool by mentioning khav (i.e. like a million teenagers dropping the secret password to supposed worldliness, `beer'). Again, there are some grown ups who can actually write about sex, or alcohol, with some insight - this sort of stuff is embarrassingly tryhard.<br />As indeed is the style at too frequent intervals. Again, how long can you think it's sophisticated to write pompous self-satisfied paragraphs like:<br /> 'There had been another mail packet waiting from Rovigo in Astibar. Which, when opened, proved to contain two letters this time, one which gave off - even after its time in transit - an extraordinary effusion of scent.<br /> Alessan, his eyebrows elaborately arched, presented this pale blue emanation to Devin with infinite suggestiveness...<br /> The perfume, unmistakably, was Selvina's. Devin's expression, as he took cautious possession of the envelope, must have been revealing because he heard Catriona giggle suddenly. He was careful not to look at her.<br /> Selvina's missivewas a single headlong sentence - much like the girl herself. She did, however, make one vivid suggestion that induced him to decline when the others asked innocently if they might peruse his communication.'<br />What's next??? We could reasonably expect:<br />\\"Ooooh, lovers...\\"<br />\\"You shut-up.\\"<br />Maybe, just maybe you could handle something of this (although the style here is simply bad) if you liked the naïve young character, but he's being sold to us as a highly intelligent analyst, a blooded assassin, a supremely confident professional performer, and an experienced lover (who's held his dying love) who's up for a bit of tail if it presents itself in a cupboard or involves some S & M with a total stranger. It amazes me how common (McCaffrey, Asimov, Eddings, Jordan, Goodkind...) this sort of immature tosh is in supposedly adult fiction. It would be much better if they simply cut the sex out (they're not that good at it) and unashamedly wrote innocent adolescent fiction.<br />Finally, Guy, this is something you need to pay attention to if you're writing about music: text is NOT an aural medium. No matter how much you tell us just how fabulous the performances are in this story, it just doesn't work when you're only using words. It's like someone saying, \\"I heard this hilarious joke the other day - honestly, it was soooo funny. It was, um, about this cow and this, um, windmill or something, but, boy, sheeesh, did I laugh.\\" Now I'm not saying that you can't write a good book about musicians (Ian Banks' Espedair Street; Peter Goldsworthy's Maestro), but if you are, it's pretty absurd to just keep bleating on about just how damn good they sound to an audience who, by definition, can't hear them.

US	34705979	R36T73NB7TW9RY	0140057463	859061015	How Far Can You Go?	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Perceptive case studies Catholics born circa 1940	Lodge is always worth reading. He is a very honest writer, a handy thing when so much of his stuff is quasi-autobiographical. These are real people, or as real as Lodge understands them, and he's not without insight.<br />I don't relish Lodge as others would, because I've taken a different direction to him (and, perhaps, because he's more of my parents' generation). He can't help but favour characters more in line with his own value system, and this is particularly going to rub against me in a novel such as this one which has religion as its central concern. That being said, he's not overwhelmingly judgemental, and often is describing more than prescribing.<br />He commonly uses sex as the climax of his novels (Out from the Shelter; Small World, Paradise News, Therapy - although in this latter it's more the resolution), and this is no exception. He's more matter of fact about it than overly voyeuristic, and I suspect he'd contend that it was just part of his honesty; sex is such big issue to us, and he's giving it a proportionally justifiable position.<br />The title of the book relates to several areas though, not just the obvious sexual one. The one I found most cogent is more the Roman Catholic issue of how far can you break away from the traditional teaching of the church and still be a Roman Catholic - or, indeed, be anything at all? This issue, of course, has been felt deeply in Protestant circles as well. But, right or wrong (and thankfully he has the good grace not to tell us), for example, hell disappeared somewhere during the 60s. And if you don't believe in that - as in practise myriad Catholics stopped doing - a lot of things start drifting.<br />The major issue he relates this to is the Catholic stance on birth control. It's no co-incidence that the decade of the pill was also the decade of a massive turn away from the church. You finally could have your cake and eat it too. No sex outside marriage was not such a huge sticking point for people staying with the church before contraception: everyone unavoidably had the Catholic stance on birth control. People now think they can have sex without responsibility; before they knew they couldn't. And the churches both Protestant and Catholic can still seem to convey that as long as you're not sleeping around you're a good Christian. In some ways this has been a bit of a favour for the church: nominalism is not the problem it used to be. Liberalism, however, is rampant.<br />I must confess, too, I think the Catholic stance on birth control is more consistent with a theology which values sex as highly as the bible does. It makes sense that this act is seen as always profound - profound enough to begin life. This does not have to cancel the pleasure, but it sure as hell adds the appropriate sense of responsibility.<br />I agreed with the way he concluded the novel by setting up sound bites of different Catholics at a festival (playing with the form as he likes to do, this time switching from narrative to a video transcript). He highlights the massively contradictory nature of these beliefs. He leans towards agnosticism in the light of all this, but isn't utterly dismissive of alternatives (just of their blindness to the contradictions).<br />He traces the lives of a dozen or so individuals all sharing a mass one morning, with each section dealing with unities:<br />\\"How it was\\" - something of the innocence and differing motivations of the 50s<br />\\"How they lost their virginities\\" - well, this is a David Lodge book, after all..<br />\\"How things began to change\\"<br />\\"How they lost their fear of hell'<br />`How they broke out, away, down, up, through etc.' - by the end all are massively changed, and this is partly the result of the times (eg. Around Vatican II and the pill), not necessarily a transcendent life stage thing.<br />I'd thought particularly about how some people I know of that generation had their world and world view changed. Yet others weathered it: I believe what was essential about their faith was not caught up in the changing values of society. Just as it should be, Christians should always been at odds with the general culture, and always value the fruit of the spirit - which are timeless - above mores.<br />Another pleasure of the book is the way he toys with `how far can you go' inserting the author himself into the text, and maintaining the genre of novel as opposed to essay.

I also remembered the technique she used of telling us early that one of her characters fiddled with their glasses when perplexed, and later just saying when they started fiddling). All the plot seems to happen in the last couple of chapters, whereas until that point we're just getting a picture of the main two characters. Our central character, Helen, is a 52 year old woman dealing with the death of her overbearing mother, who may have actually altered the whole course of her daughter's life by, for example, not handing on a potentially vital love letter Helen finds while sorting her mother's things. The issue for Helen is less whether things really would have been different if her mother hadn't have been involved than how much she is to blame for not taking a stand, for being too pliant.<br />Lively is good, you get to like and respect Helen. A major theme is linking nature to our lives: how do we deal with the fact that we really are just beasts with intelligence? (The conclusion manages to have some hope in this bleak outlook: 'They saw that there is nothing to be done, but that something can be retrieved.') This is the assumption - obviously I deal with it differently to Lively. And I suppose I put a minus after the A because I think her insight, while profound in some areas, doesn't extend to respecting anyone with alternate views. The novel is a bit preachy (in a relatively subtle way - it's not the only concern of the book), and does unapologetically reduce several characters to mere goodies and baddies (eg. Ron Plaget, Helen's mother, Giles Carnaby, Susan Wilmot). She also is pushing a pretty tough barrow: she wants us to feel sympathy for Helen's 49 year old brother, a repressed homosexual who gropes the neighbour's 14 year old, and to utterly condemn, in contrast, anyone in society opposed to homosexuality - including the father of the 14 year old (set up for a fall, of course, an utterly immoral opportunist). The way she tells the story, we are sympathetic, but it is such a contrived 'moral' that makes its point but undermines the universality of the story.<br />Plotwise, slow moving, sure, but a dynamite finish, with several things all happening at once, rather than conveniently pacing themselves throughout the drama. We reel with the characters with no time to wallow over major events as more major ones rudely jump in. The irony is thick as Helen's younger sister talks on about her daily crisis' assuming that her stick in the mud single older siblings will have had nothing to report - when actually they're going though much more that she probably will never give the chance to hear (shades of some conversations I've had with ' also reminds me of that ably presented scene in 'Pulp Fiction' where Bruce Willis' character, on the run from the mob, has to tread carefully around his girlfriend's potential tantrums about her nails or whatever).<br />Like I said, she's good - but she should read some Hornby and see it's possible to present characters that differ but are both respectable. It does surprise me when people like Lively or Adam Spencer (JJJ presenter/mathamatician) do just write off anyone who believes that the complexity and beauty of nature suggest there is a God. Not just disagree, but vehemently abuse. Surely somewhere they've come across someone they respect who holds to this idea? Maybe they have but can't put the two together.

You can see where this journalist would have thought he was onto something - the basic story of the sheer volume of valuable maps stolen by one guy is interesting. Moreover not many of us know about the ins and out of the map trade, and obviously many of the first maps of an area have a story behind them. It's like someone who's put a fair bit of work into their honours thesis and thinks, \\"Hey, I reckon I could just push this a bit further and pull out a Ph.D.\\"<br /><br />This is where a good supervisor/editor could have stepped in and reintroduced some reality: \\"Mate, that'd be an excellent story, but you'll never spin it out into a whole book.\\"<br /><br />Harvey could have pushed his case. This is potentially interesting stuff, and he's a decent enough writer: the style is palatable and carries you along ... BUT, dammit, we need some better content. The book hinged hugely on whether or not his central figure was interesting enough. Gilbert Bland, however, was not only essentially unremarkable - he wasn't even available to be interviewed! At this point Harvey should have admitted defeat, cut his losses and got onto something else . Instead we get chapters of absurd padding - interviews with wildly speculating psychologists - none of whom have exchanged two words with their subject - about the unconscious motivations of collectors and thieves. Was it his difficult family background? Trauma from his years in Vietnam? Joke is after all this even Harvey himself comes up with the earth-shattering theory that Bland stole the maps because they were worth money and he was greedy.<br /><br />Well, stone me - who would have thought it?<br /><br />Even if Harvey had have managed to get the interview he constantly begged Bland to grant, it's dubious whether Bland would have had much interesting to say. He was a dishonest guy who stole things - it could have been computers or hardware - the only reason he was even worth an article was that he stole rare maps.<br /><br />Sure, there is some engaging material in relating some of the ripping yarns of the original cartographers. But this is wholly undermined by Harvey's at times excruciatingly contrived attempts to parallel them to his own 'quests' and 'discoveries' in his search for the material to make a decent book. You'll get something like, \\"Magellan had to navigate his way right around the globe ... just like I was navigating my way around the globe of Bland's life,\\" - and he'll spin this sort of spurious metaphor out for pages, investing it with some absurd synchronistic spiritual significance. While the rest of the book is mildly diverting if taken in small doses, his attempts to make some sort of powerful coherence by poring over his journey in creating the book are, well, bad. They make bad reading, they make you groan and roll your eyes.<br /><br />In a sense, though, I suppose, good luck to him. He has turned all the work he'd invested in a nice idea that didn't pan out (through no fault of his own) into a completed (and successful) book. Not a bad trick given the ultimate paucity of his material. Better for him than just throwing it into the bin once he realised he wasn't going to get the interview with Bland, and the book was never going to be really good. Like a researcher whose tests didn't result in the cataclysmic results he'd hoped for, he's professionally written up and published the results anyway rather than just shrivel up. However, from the reader's perspective there are plenty of other books out there where the results did come up - where the central figures ARE fascinating. The Island of Lost Maps won't hurt you, but there are better stories to spend your time on - ones that (unlike me with this one) you won't find yourself putting aside two thirds of the way through. Let me suggest, for example, William Dalrymple's [[ASIN:0006547745 From the Holy Mountain: A Journey in the Shadow of Byzantium]] - where the author, similarly, follows a hunch that there's a book in an interest of his, but much more successfully pulls off the mix of striking history, personal experience and novel contemporary characters.e Holy Mountain: A Journey in the Shadow of Byzantium]] - where the author, similarly, follows a hunch that there's a book in an interest of his, but much more successfully pulls off the mix of striking history, personal experience and novel contemporary characters.	2004-03-15
US	34705979	RRLXVFAELH3VA	1569470545	56387718	Hippopotamus	Books	3	13	25	N	N	Able writing. Definitively gratuitous immorality	There's much to like and enjoy in this book - what a pity there's also Fry's mandatory offensiveness. It's as if you were being taken through a lovely and fascinating house, but now and again have to scrape crap off your shoes because the owner, who otherwise has admirable taste and resources, unaccountably feels that he should defecate here and there throughout the place to show his cheeky wit or worldly sophistication. A nicer analogy would perhaps be to say it's like having to suffer drunken noisy yuppies talking over a fabulous jazz band because they refuse to play in a concert hall - the experience is really undermined by the context. But if Fry was choosing between the two analogies, he'd take the turd  every time.<br />The Hippopotamus, at least, unlike The Liar, doesn't scrupulously ensure some adulterous reference or activity every few pages, however Fry forces some definitively gratuitous perversion into the plot. The book would have worked perfectly (indeed, far better) if David felt his 'gift' could work through innocent touch, but Fry's hardly incontestable preaching that any sort of sexual activity (sodomy, adultery, fornication, casual, minors, promiscuity, prostitution, bestiality, seduction...) is at worst utterly harmless, and probably beneficial, is the ugly cost of spending much time with his narrative or characters.<br />In most writers that would be enough to see me dismiss the book entirely - why put yourself in such deliberately offensive company? This question is more than rhetorical, however, as my 'B' grade is meant to reflect the level of ambivalence I have in recommending it. That being said, given the overt and considerable flaws of content and philosophy, there must be some pretty damn redeeming features.<br />Such as his central character. He's well drawn and likeable - a clever trick given that Ted himself would have the honesty to admit that he's an appallingly selfish old dissolute mongrel. Here and there among all the fabulously rude invective we're allowed to be won over by little examples of his subtle consideration for the underdog. His trenchant diatribes are often thoroughly enjoyable. Moreover the supporting cast are ably painted, and the dialogue in, for example, the big dining scene, powerful and driving. Moreover we get the occasional Lodge-like added pleasure of the same event from differing perspectives.<br />The setting and plot turn out to happily borrow much from a classic English mannered detective story: there's a mystery, new sensational 'crimes' keep popping up to drive us along (in this case miraculous healings), and our prescribed set of characters interact in a wealthy country house. The climactic revelation - the traditional detective taking his pleasure in unravelling the crime to his decreasingly sceptical audience - ties the book together well enough (not brilliantly, but far better than the scratchy mess of the resolution of The Liar). There's still the deus ex machina of most crime books - the frustrating way events the reader could not possibly be aware of (such as Jane's condition) confirm the detective's otherwise wild theory  - but this is bearable.<br />And finally, stylistically Fry is wonderfully readable. His prose (occasional content aside) is generally a pleasant ride - not Wodehouse or Adams, but not needing to be, and not suffering from the comparison.<br />I can see how some would relish his books - all the philosophical and sexual bias that put me off would give sympathisers enormous pleasure: what could be more fun than bashing believers and eulogising rampantly promiscuous gays? And over-indulging an over-the-top character like Oliver would be like having an extra helping of dessert - fine if you haven't been feeling nauseous since it initially appeared. And while this might be an inflammatory line to take, it's monumentally ironic that anyone could dare take offense from any attack on a book so deliberately inflammatory and offensive to any Christian reader.<br />So, there you go. I dare say my reaction is not entirely dissimilar to that of Fry who probably loves much of the work of the many high profile pro-heterosexual fidelity devout protestants in the western literary tradition, but finds the underlying assumptions of their admirable works a bitter pill to have to endure along the way.hristian reader. <br />So, there you go.

I can see something of the style influencing his 'Great Divorce', but where I found Lewis' allegory striking and insightful, I never really felt like I got the drift of MacDonald.<br />Maybe it's a bit Zen - if you try to analyse you'll never get it - and I think in the book we're told not to try to think about fairyland too critically.<br />The book is very dreamlike, wafting around from scene to scene, all sort of making sense within the dream, but quite absurd if you step back. There are several stories within the story, but it's hardly a gripping read. It seems every character is part of an allegory, but there's rarely a stinging point. The narrator does seem to go through a process of losing his pride, but I could hardly tell you how and why it happened. There's bits and pieces of knightly chivalry and mysticism floating around, and maybe if I was immersed in things like Spenser's 'Faerie Queen' and the Arthurian tales it would have done more for me. And, sure, the guy can create and sustain a real mood, but, sorry, this leaden soul just wasn't open for whatever enchantment may or may not have been there.	2004-02-22

I've never read one before, sort of grouping it in with series like `Babysitters' Club'. And, sure, it's entirely genre driven - we start with the clich&eacute;s: dragons, knights, wizards - it's the opposite to someone having an idea and deciding to set it in a certain genre for some reason. Moreover, as a branch of TSR (the D &amp; D company), it's chock full of a menagerie of mythical beasts (think Pok&eacute;mon and trading cards), and unfolds like a D &amp; D campaign - you could imagine people counting up their hit points against a dreadwolf or a minataur.<br />Characters are utterly two dimensional, but I suppose that's OK, because stereotype is deliberate (stone me if that young maidservant/princess/sorceress isn't gorgeous - and here's a sketch picture - I kid you not). The book is driven by action and novelty, and the desire to feed a certain market. And as such, I suppose it does pretty well; it's never trying to be a great book. There's nothing really awful to make you put the book down (though nothing to make you compulsively turn the pages either). Probably excellent for young teens.	2004-01-07

He seems to almost have his own genre of which he and Pratchett are the leading exponents. I can't say I laughed out loud too often (although the picture of a drunken Zaphod sticking a birdcage over his second head and badly pretending to be a pirate is hilarious), but it was a very pleasant ride - even if the conclusion is surprisingly bleak for what feels like a light comedy. Like Pratchett (and there are so many `like Pratchett's, although that's probably in the wrong comparative order) Adams throws in some agnostic themes with his humour, although here the ultimate meaninglessness of life is treated a little less whimsically.<br /><br />It's an interesting hotchpotch of action (and cutting between various cliff-hanger scenes), philosophy, stand-up comic perspectives of the everyday, domestic sit-com, satirical SF, and Douglas' own pleasure in blithely hurling his characters through six impossible things before breakfast. The plot is surprisingly coherent although occasionally incidental.<br /><br />I still would almost be surprised if Adams didn't cite Pynchon's [[ASIN:006091307X The Crying of Lot 49]] as a thematic and stylistic influence. Here he lets his sensible and considerate astrologer state the theme that it doesn't matter so much what you believe in (`truth' is irrelevant), but you need something as a structure, a lens, to enable you to live satisfactorily. Adams unsurprisingly explains this much better:<br />\\"I know that astrology isn't a science ... of course it isn't. It's just an arbitrary set of rules like chess or tennis ... The rules just kind of got there. They don't make any kind of sense except in terms of themselves. But when you start to exercise those rules, all sorts of processes start to happen and you start to find out all sorts of stuff about people. In astrology the rules happen to be about stars and planets, but they could be about ducks and drakes for all the difference it would make. It's just a way of thinking about a problem which lets the shape of that problem begin to emerge. The more rules, the tinier the rules, the more arbitrary they are, the better. It's like throwing a handful of fine graphite dust on a piece of paper to see where the hidden indentations are. It lets you see the words that were written on the piece of paper above it that's now been taken away and hidden. The graphite's not important. It's just the means of revealing the indentations. So you see, astrology's nothing to do with astronomy. It's just to do with people thinking about people.\\"<br /><br />`Discuss', huh.<br /><br />Yet another author struggles to reconcile loss of faith in major, particularly religious, concepts of truth with the inner conviction that there are important, good and beautiful things all around - that it's not all just meaningless.<br /><br />And it is a struggle, as in the climax (spoiler warning) Trillian explains to her traumatised daughter who desperately wants to know who she is, where her home is, where she `fits':<br />This is not your home ... You don't have one. We none of us have one. Hardly anyone has one anymore. The missing ship I was just talking about. The people of that ship don't have a home. They don't know where they are from. The don't even have any memory of who they are or what they are for. The are very lost and very confused and very frightened.<br /><br />Yeah, ha ha, good one Douglas - hardly Wodehouse light humour. Human condition anyone? I wonder if Adams and Pratchett self-consciously have wanted to be taken `seriously'? I could see that it could be frustrating for them to be dismissed as merely lightweight because they're so popular. They often contain more articulate thought than works by more academic writers, and shouldn't be seen as lesser merely because they happen to also be very good at amusing and entertaining (quite the opposite). That being said, their books should also come with a flyleaf caveat: \\"Warning - strong post-modern agenda permeates the following jokes\\".ng - strong post-modern agenda permeates the following jokes\\".	2004-01-01

They're all larger than life. We're not dealing with post-modern self-doubting everymen stumbling through life, these are extreme characters in extreme circumstances: it's not too often you're going to pause and say, \\"Hmmm, I know exactly how he feels.\\" Likewise the plot, action, and devices. It's all around a quest for revenge (or is it justice?), there are crucial letters, poisonings, star-crossed lovers' trysts, courtroom performances, disguises, last minute averted bankruptcy, and, for goodness sake, yet another of these meddlesome priests with their cunning plans to fake a death with an ingenious potion. We have dozens of prose soliloquies, characters turning over their plans, doubts and motivations, and wonderful extended dialogue, with people talking with a depth and precision mere mortals could never hope to improvise (even if there aren't as many killer one-liners in there).<br />And while I'm making big comparisons why not throw in Tolkien: Dumas too has pulled off an epic. I can't think of many other books of this size that maintain such coherency. Now they do it in different ways, and Dumas teeters on the edge in a couple of places (while Tolkien is sublimely on track the whole time - he simply needed that many words to tell his story), but they both still manage to bring so much to a basic central story line. Most epics climax in book one, then have weak sequels added on once the publishers realise they have a hit. Most unsuccessfully try to reopen the old story and climb back in to a structure that will not fit them, and only undermine the superior complete original (Card, Jordan, Feist). Some series avoid this mistake by telling a new story within the old world (Pratchett, Leiber, Saberhagen), but this isn't making an epic. In the Mars series, Robinson gave himself freedom to continue because no character is indispensable, the future is open.<br />But Dumas! Like I said, in a couple of places he's on the brink, but doesn't quite fall over. We wonder why we spend quite so much time with Franz - who turns out to be quite incidental - but in Dumas' defence, to meet Edmond reinvented as the Count through Franz' eyes is an intriguing and clever way to introduce him. Indeed, the book could almost have started here (and the second part does feel like an entirely new book for some time), but, like Tolkien, rather than leap in with the `main' story, Dumas patiently and painstakingly has to paint the whole history before we get there. But while Tolkien splits up the major characters and has us desperately turning pages as he leaves each in cliff-hanger situations, Dumas has the slowest of slow burns running through the whole book. You don't have to read it all in a sitting, and as the protagonist points out, a simple and quick revenge would not be just or satisfying. So he takes his sweet time. Along the way some of the time he spends to flesh out the characters of the sons and daughters of the subjects of the Count's patient and comprehensive revenge seems liberal, but I suppose Dumas could say with his Count, `What's your hurry?'<br />And to carry you along you have this wonderfully sophisticated French high society. Being cool - or being honourable - is not only about ego and looking good, it has a major effect on your whole family's prospects. Make a fool of yourself in public, and you could lose your credibility - which could also cost you your house or your life. How you're presented, who presents you, and how you carry it off is a game with big stakes. There was an excellent SBS movie that caught something of this - about a relatively low income 19th Century noble who actually cares for the people on his land, and knows the only way to save them is to get them clean water. To afford this he needs the court's patronage - and the favour of the court has nothing to do with the needs of the poor, and everything to do with whether you are seen as having a lively wit. Thedecent noble has to play the dirtiest games to do good. It's in this sort of Dangerous Liaisons context that much of the drama takes place, and Dumas does it well (indeed he's probably the prototype).<br />Moreover his count is a real triumph. He imagined the pinnacle of 19th Century cool and painted it. Moreover he gives us the whole process of just why this guy has got it so completely together. He's Shaft, James Bond, Miles Davis ... whoever ... you just can't touch him. So when the reader gets to see someone getting a bit close to his self-possession it has a real impact.<br />When we do eventually get to the resolutions of the old wounds, they are powerful and satisfying. I said this is Shakespearian, and there's no pulling punches here - the crimes are terrible, the prices paid apposite, and both are vividly and minutely explored. Hence the massive length of the book - but this epic, unlike so many others, is coherent.<br />And all this without even mentioning the fascinating central philosophical issue of just who the Count thinks he is to take charge of so many lives. Is he, as he contends, merely the agent of providence? But the way he treats those he cares for seems at times more cruel than the way he treats his foes! The torture he puts Morrel through can only be compared to God calling Abraham to sacrifice his son. Monte Cristo is unapologetically taking the role of God, and his justification is that:<br />...There is neither happiness nor grief in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another - nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness...<br />It's a tough one to try to pull off. Did he manage it?

Other attributes are secondary.<br /> <br />There's the Lovecraftian sense of non-anthrocentrism, although each planet's species has a benign angelic overseer - except humanity. From this come all our ills, particularly illustrated in this story, greed and humanism. The former is dismissed cursorily, the latter more carefully undermined, challenging the notion that technological advances bestow rightful authority (a far less popular idea since 1945).<br /> <br />As a wonderful idea to explore an argument and a world view, this is admirable. Moreover Lewis respectfully and ably adapted H.G. Wells' style for his own purposes. Look elsewhere, however, for action sequences, snappy dialogue, and psychology: Lewis' characters consistently, purely and rationally act out their basic convictions.	2003-12-10

While he's still working with a persona he's familiar with - a young Catholic academic - the book is less honest and quasi-autobiographical than usual (although he clearly understands the procrastinating nature of the student too well). Rather it's a deliberate, often quite broad, comic piece and while he's better at it than many others I don't think humour is his strongest asset. Perhaps the book was something of a way of working on his skills, and as such a lot of the situations felt contrived (of course all the situations in novels are contrived, but the best ones don't usually feel that way). Indeed, as he notes in his interesting afterword (it's nice when later editions include some `DVD' type extras), there are no less than ten passages of deliberate and at times extended parody of the styles of famous novelists such as Conrad, James and Hemmingway, and half the trick is making the story work while playing with these forms. Alas, with only the gnostic secrets of a dimly remembered B.A. in Lit. at Macquarie Uni at hand, these in-jokes went right by me; a more literate reader could enjoy the book a lot more I dare say.<br /> <br />Thematically much is made of the issue of birth control and Catholicism, an issue he explored more effectively in How Far Can You Go? Lodge tragic-comically presents the picture of couples torturing themselves with the absurd (and ineffective) complexities of things like the `safe' and `rhythm' methods, when assumed by Lodge (as implied in the text and stated in the afterword) the only possible alleviation of this awful state is contraception: the Catholic church is simply cruel and wrong to deny this.<br />Admittedly he does give a good alternative line to a Catholic priest: \\"Practise some self control: I do,\\" but even this paints the picture of the devout catholic couple having to undergo great sacrifice and suffering ... as if there are no other means (perhaps even preferable ones for the woman) of achieving sexual pleasure than intercourse. The naivety surprises me, but I suppose sex was so little talked about in the fifties that a lot of `nice' people did assume that sex meant merely the `act' (part of me feels sure, however, that a lot of people in pre-pill times would have been better at finding ways of `safe-sex' than today's condom-culture knows). Conversational mores have changed - previously the bible was something social pressure pushed you to make time for, discuss and pursue, but sex was embarrassing to talk about, something of a faux pas, and characterised by much ignorance: now the roles are reversed. Whatever, I can't feel the degree of sympathy Lodge wants to evoke given the knowledge that it's not an either/or of celibacy or conception, of contraception or rare and fearfully anxious sex.<br />Moreover he doesn't begin to address the uncomfortable notion that just maybe the catholic church does have a case: that it would be no bad thing if society felt that if you weren't prepared to potentially raise a(nother) child you shouldn't be having intercourse; that sex should be treated with a lot more reverence and respect. The denial of consequence in sex is immediately convenient, but hardly morally courageous, or even intellectually admissible. I'm not saying a case can't be made for contraception, I'm just saying that Lodge doesn't seem to acknowledge that some intelligent and sincere people have made a reasonable case against it. Clearly in the last generation there's been a massive increase in casual sex due to the easy acceptance of contraception: whether or not this is a GOOD thing, either morally or even in terms of the ultimate felicity of the individuals involved, is hardly a closed question.ns (perhaps even preferable ones for the woman) of achieving sexual pleasure than intercourse.

Most of the several short stories in the book centre on him recounting some interesting job he's been involved in. <br /> <br />Rather than remain invisible and let 'Faussone' do all the talking, the listener/narrator is also allowed to take on a role - the stories are clearly placed in a setting of Faussone talking to the semi-autobiographical persona of Levi. We learn a little of why he's putting down these stories, his own speculation on whether writing is a worthy 'craft' compared to that of the tradesman, and he even drops in a work story of his own (as a chemist - Levi himself was a chemist) to conclude. Levi highlights the importance of the listener and the context to the stories, which, while entertaining enough to stand on their own, are enhanced by tangents of setting and response. Moreover there's room for just a little plot and relationship development winding alongside the stories.<br /> <br />As close as I can think of are the James Herriot stories, although I suspect some of Levi's fans would be a bit horrified at the comparison. That being said, I suspect 'Herriot' himself would have enjoyed the book. Levi's stories, however, are not nearly as formulaic (or as funny), and Levi is a more able painter of characters that feel more authentic, and don't necessarily need to be pigeon-holed. Amusing that Faussone feels more authentic than some of Herriot's doubtless 'real' recollected characters: in a postscript Levi says,<br />\\"Faussone is imaginary but \\"perfectly authentic,\\" at the same time; he is a compound, a mosaic of numerous men I have met, similar to Faussone...\\"<br /> <br />There's a grace there as well - which some would find bland - this isn't sensationalist fiction with a sting or a belly laugh. Levi does have an agenda - to suggest that a worker who takes pride and pleasure in his trade is as good a subject (and hero) for a novel as any super spy or renegade cop or tortured academic or whatever. There's also an acknowledgement of giving some praise to Levi and Faussone's fathers in this, so perhaps he can be forgiven if his picture is a bit eulogistic.<br /> <br />The 'wrench' (if the translation got this right) isn't just a symbol of blue collar labour, it's also the wrench between the metaphysical profession of writing books and that of actually making tangible things. The 'Levi' of the stories is struggling with this, and Faussone's parting advice to him is:<br />\\"...I tell you, doing things you can touch with your hands has an advantage: you can make comparisons and understand how much you are worth. You make a mistake, you correct it, and next time you don't make it...\\"<br />and earlier 'Levi' speculated that perhaps so many writers have bad stress because they can't test their work with a level or a gauge, and are working blind half the time.<br /> <br />So, if you're in the mood for something reflective, diverting, and well written - go ahead. If you're after some action or melodrama, wait for another mood.mic or whatever.

Also plenty of music in jokes for people born in the 50s or 60s. I relate to the anatomy of a dying relationship - the ugly mess that you may have decided to break up, but there are still all these ties. And even though you don't want to get back together, this pathetic part of you wants them to feel like it's still costing them something not to be with you.<br /> <br />There's also the thing about the loss of magic once you move in with someone: before every meeting was an exciting assignation - now they're just there because they're not somewhere else. Indeed, somewhere else is where there's some preparations made. It still seems a shame that nakedness can become so casual and non-sexual, but to make a big deal of it would be too inconvenient and after a while, farcical.<br /> <br />The central character's deep closing insight (although there are insights right along the journey. Hornby comes across as someone able to be honest with himself, even some ugly bits, but he still basically likes himself, so it doesn't turn into a jaded piece) is talking about the long-term partner he's finally decided he wants to marry:<br />\\"I know what's wrong with Laura. What's wrong with Laura is I'll never see her for the first or second or third time again. I'll never spend two or three days in a sweat trying to remember what she looks like, never again will I get to a pub half an hour early to meet her, staring at the same article in a magazine and looking at my watch every thirty seconds, never again will thinking about her set something off in me like `Let's get it on' sets something off in me.\\"<br /> <br />Yet novelty is so pathetic compared to commitment - as Hornby continues:<br />\\"And sure, I love her and like her and have good conversations, nice sex and intense rows with her, and she looks after me and worries about me ...., but what does that all count for, when someone with bare arms, a nice smile and a pair of Doc Martins comes into the shop and says she wants to interview me? Nothing, that's what, but maybe it should count for a bit more.\\"<br /> <br /> In How Far Can You Go, David Lodge goes further by describing a guy who's been married for twenty years acting on an infatuation with a secretary. Far from the usual Hollywood `a love too deep to be denied, a forbidden love' as being grand and passionate, Lodge shows how stupidly out of sync the indiscretion is with the whole rest of his life - he hasn't begun to think about the implications, of what this could cost him, and how little in effect it's really offering. Likewise the girl doesn't really know what to do with him now.<br /> <br />Earlier in the book Laura remonstrates with Rob (1st person narrator) about how, of course, in trying to always keep doors open he's actually closing at least as many more.<br /> <br />There's some other interesting stuff touching on class, and even more basic proofs that just because someone doesn't know the difference between Miles Davis and Acker Bilk (an example from my own experience, not Hornby's) they still may be worth talking to. Some people (especially in this society that lets you string out your teenage lifestyle and, in some cases, ignorance, well into your thirties) may spend decades in a proudly pretentious sub-culture, foolishly only allowing friendships with a the few who share their prejudices.<br />And, dammit, it is a very satisfying book. With his wit, honesty and readability Hornby could, like so many others, have got by without much of a plot. But plotwise this book hinges on a funeral, which, true to life, comes out of the blue. We're just cruising along in this generally feel good novel (although it does touch on some ugly stuff, and in his `four awful things I've done' slap you right in the face), and experiencing most of the big emotional things in past tense detachment. Plotwise we may vaguely expect Rob to come to terms with Laura's departure and to maybe hook up with someone else. Then Laura's dad dies, somehow we get this full on climactic scene where Rob's at the funeral, and Laura ends up saying to him, \\"I'm too tired not to go out with you.\\" Later she explains:<br />\\"I thought that we were bound by one simple little cord, our relationship, and if I cut it, then that would be that. So I cut it, but that wasn't that. There wasn't just one cord, but hundreds, thousands, everywhere I turned ... and then on the day of the funeral, it was me that wanted you to be there, not my mum. I mean, she was quite pleased, I think, but it never occurred to me to ask Ray, and that's when I felt tired. I wasn't prepared to do all that work. It wasn't worth it, just to be shot of you.\\"<br /> <br />Hornby managed to throw this into a really powerful context.<br /> <br />The sub-plot about Rob taking up DJing again is a bit cheesy, but everyone wants a happy ending.<br /> <br />Strewth, quite a diarising type review - but that's one of the things I enjoy about Hornby - he relates to me. Whereas when I leant a About a Boy to nearing retirement A.  (who's given me Stone Diaries and The Idea of Perfection), she couldn't relate - much as I couldn't to these undeniably well written books. Maybe it's a generational thing: not just the pop-culture references, but the whole `vibe', man, that two similarly aged people may unconsciously share.omehow we get this full on climactic scene where Rob's at the funeral, and Laura ends up saying to him, \\"I'm too tired not to go out with you.\\" Later she explains: <BR>\\"I thought that we were bound by one simple little cord, our relationship, and if I cut it, then that would be that.

He takes himself very seriously, and the prose is always measured and careful, controlled.<br /> <br />Ishiguro also wrote The Remains of the Day, and likewise many will find it stifling. L. read it and got annoyed at the way this older voice was always apologising or justifying or condescending to the actions and thoughts of the child.<br /> <br />Still, definitely not a totally self-aware character, and some of the effect is to deliberately tell us something about the older character by the way he narrates the younger.<br /> <br />If you're looking for places to exclaim, \\"Holmes, that's brilliant,\\" at the deductive prowess of someone described in the book as a celebrated detective, it doesn't really happen. But somehow you don't seem to notice because of all the tangents describing people and places.<br /> <br />There's also the (seemingly) central mystery to carry you along. Gradually you realise that the persona's parents both disappeared, and this is the big case he's setting himself up to solve.<br /> <br />Ishiguro doesn't let him (or us) just get on with solving it though - there are other people and issues distracting him. Still, it does appear that finally he's about to crack it.<br /> <br />Up til now you may have just thought this was an OK novel in terms of presenting characters and something of the nature of how life unfolds, often without our control. More than a mere detective novel, but we'll take that too.<br /> <br />Then the whole thing just departs - and makes it, in my opinion, a stand out book. If you haven't read it yet and you want to get the effect, don't read on.<br /> <br />He goes back to Shanghai, but there is invasion/civil war in China. The Europeans are still there in their safe section, while the Kuo-min-tang are putting up the only resistance to Japanese invasion. Banks is suitably disgusted by the way the Europeans callously enjoy their dance parties while bombs are landing on the populace around them. They ignore any responsibility or compassion.<br /> <br />Meanwhile, he's getting closer to solving the case! He thinks he may have found where his parents are hidden, and sets out to find them. This is complicated by a romantic sub-plot, but more so by the fact that this house is behind the battle line. The narration, along with the narrator, becomes more and more fevered and dreamlike/nightmarish. We are wanting him to solve this case 'against a backdrop of the Japanese invasion of China', but (unlike the context of a thousand other novels set in violent times) the invasion refuses to remain a backdrop. Rather inconveniently for our hero and us, minor characters keep getting in the way, can't they just go off and be dealt with and let us/him get on with it. Don't they realise how important this is - this is his big case! The central plotline of the book. But while we agree with him, we get increasingly uncomfortable with the way he forces Chinese characters - still subservient to Europeans - to risk (and lose) their lives to enable him to fulfil his (our) quest.<br /> <br />By the time he finally gets to the house, THE house, where he can be reunited with his long lost parents, the house has been recently shelled. Instead of finding his parents, he finds a very recently injured and orphaned girl with the corpses of her parents. The irony is thick, as we can't feel sorry for him in the light of what's just happened in this house, and doubtless in a thousand others. He loses it, and starts trying to comfort the girl, \\"Don't worry, I'm a celebrated detective, I can solve this crime.\\" He insanely pulls out his magnifying glass and starts looking for clues. This is brutally effective farce.<br /> <br />But this is what we do. Real people and suffering in real life serve as a mere 'background' for the dramas of our own lives. I remember a med student coming back from working overseas with some desperately poor, but the way she narrated it, they were merely interesting experiences. It was a novel holiday.<br /> <br />Likewise, for us it was a novel thing to hear her relate her experiences.<br /> <br />Ishiguro, for my money, really captures something of our British Raj approach to the darkies (or whoever), and the drippingly unconscious condescension even when we're speaking well of them.<br /> <br />A very clever way to use a convention to make such a powerful statement.<br /> <br />He does solve the mystery later, but by this time we're all a bit numb, and it's all much more in perspective.<br /> <br />And very strong that what we're getting into perspective is something that in the west would be something any individual could use to claim utter precedence on sympathy - the disappearance of their parents when they were only a child.<br /> <br />We were interested in what happened to them, and we wanted Banks to find them, but, like him, by the time we do we don't really care nearly as much. We know it's not that important. Or if it is, we're just ignoring a whole heap of much more important things constantly, merely because they happen to poor people.rom working overseas with some desperately poor, but the way she narrated it, they were merely interesting experiences.

But I'm wondering if Book 7 was a particularly low point!<br /> <br />Sure, Lieber has created a distinctive world, with some distinctive characters. The mythology underpinning it (of mercurial and at times petty gods) is refreshingly original, and now and then our heroes find themselves caught up in some dreamlike event utterly beyond their control. He creates his own mood.<br /> <br />But, blimey, the prurience. Like, really seedy, man. Sure, I could handle the comic 007/Capt. Kirk style antics of swooning bikini clad babes turning up at the most unlikely (and frequent) intervals - as long as they merely work as props/scenery, taking up, say, as much space as the next tavern or horse, and don't distract from the strengths of the book, such as characters, nice genre ideas, and novel plotting. But perhaps Lieber was still caught up with that 70s, Hugh Hefner is cool - everyone else is repressed nonsense. It's not quite 'The erotic adventures of Fafard and the Grey Mouser', but at times he devotes several pages to gratuitous soft porn about bondage and orgies.<br /> <br />Were the earlier books quite as bad as this? I don't think so: I read The Swords of Lankhmar a year or so ago and don't remember such extended voyeurism (nor, however, do I remember much in the way of plot). Maybe I excused it before on the basis of the immediately read earlier books, but now I'm quite happy to get rid of the book, even if it jeopardises my chances of having a full set. Like Julian May's Golden Torc series, better to leave some holes.<br /> <br />Oh, and I noticed the cover has a ringing endorsement from Michael Moorcock - a very good anti-endorsement in my book. Moorcock was only good when I was 13, and metamorphosed into similarly prurient dross upon re-reading post-puberty.	2003-12-03

Because it's an anthology of humorous/whimsical articles and a few daydream stories, I wisely only read it in small doses over a while - the pieces suffer if you read too many in a row, and weren't written for this. Still it means I'm not as up on exactly why it got an A-.<br /> <br />Several pieces are definitely not worthy of an A, though few would drop below a B. I recall really relishing 'Who do you think you are?', a reflection on dealing with the assumption of mediocrity. 'The Current Crisis in Remorse' was a clever satire on the much (legitimately) pilloried denial of guilt in the courts. How to write a letter was on the money, and particularly the first of 'Three Marriages' was quite touching and felt authentic.<br /> <br />He's in the same category as P.J. O'Rourke, but less biting, and his humour is not so much the clever one-liner as a slow characterisation. He rides on the edge of sentimentality but somehow rarely crosses it, managing warmth and definitive whimsicality.	2003-12-03

Hornby manages to get away with a very tricky subject by giving everyone some room (it's the issue of 1st to 3rd world). There isn't a clear moral, and different readers may sympathise more with one character than another. He exposes double standards, but doesn't stop there (that's too easy and has been done a thousand times anyway). The protagonist could do more, she's totally aware of this, but she doesn't respond by either becoming a saint, or just shutting it out. Or even just with tokenism. What's really wild is that there is a guru and a saint in the story too. And it's all around a believable family.<br /> <br />It's not a powerful and challenging book, although he does give the bleeding hearts some good lines here and there. But it keeps the readers there with the players - it's too easy to lose us by saying the truth about our greed and apathy, we even agree, but we're not about to do `what we should'. Hornby doesn't stop with `his' ringing point, he doesn't seem to have one, but he keeps having the conversation, suggesting ideas, kicking things around, not really judging. He allows you to respect different characters who may have opposing ideas - a surprisingly rare thing.	2003-12-02

Well written, often funny, Hornby manages to get away with the (only) occasionally impossibly mature and articulate child's dialogue by perceptively recounting alternate perspectives.

Where someone else might have a minor linking scene 'while dining' or something, Fry will inevitably have it 'while receiving oral sex' or the like. Is it a sex comedy? Partly, inasmuch as immorality is seen as merely amusing, although the typical bedroom farce still treats the act as a big thing, with some sense of taboo. For Fry there's not even a hint of such innocence: for him fifteen year old boys seducing homesick and confused twelve year old boys is innocence. It's almost beyond gratuitous: the sex is just scenery, and not nearly as important as, for example, the undeniably clever wordplay about sex. Although there's even something of the 'Pretty Woman' nonsense about the moral neutrality of prostitution - it means nothing more than any other trade, except that it's more glamorous and pays better. While I'm sure some moralists overstate it, this sort of absurd understatement isn't any better.<br /><br />There's also an essentially warped view of reality: he is unlikely to see virtue standing right in front of him ('What is truth' said jesting Pilate...) because he projects his own ugly stereotypes: we meet one brother and sister in the book - go straight to 'incest' (I mean, they worked on a farm - what choice does a writer have?). And on a more personal note, there is gross hypocrisy in a writer who'd bridle at yet another absurd Hollywood depiction of a gay man as emotional and neurotic - yet can blithely, and oh so obviously - write off every clergyman with his clich&eacute; dumb malicious paedophile. A guy with Fry's education has come across dozens of committed Christian writers, clergy among them (Donne, Carroll, Keirkegaard) of towering intellect, yet in this case he chooses the Daily Mirror approach to character insight.<br /><br />If you can habituate yourself to the constant seedy action (and it's disturbingly easy to do so given years of sexually oriented pop-culture; most of the raving critics in the liner notes don't even seem to notice), the language itself is drenched with wit. This is not merely a prurient cynic's mistaken 'expos&eacute;'. Fry is really far more interested in words than bodies, and he's extremely good with them. The sentences are a pleasure in themselves (think Wodehouse or Chandler, although where they often brought it home with a witty simile, Fry is funny in a dozen different ways, including ingenious puns).<br /><br />Critics often laud Fry's intelligence too (and he is undoubtedly smart), but I think a lot of this is mistaking his public school education and consequent vocabulary of literary 'in-jokes' and allusions for intellect. He's grown up on classical texts, but that doesn't make, for example, his bawdy line about the statue Eros 'burying his shaft down Shaftsbury avenue' any more intelligent than someone in primary school teasing Richard Little by shortening his first name to 'Dick' (ho ho) and reversing surname and Christian name (ha ha!). But because Fry can place this pun in the context of his knowledge of the myth of Eros and Psyche - this is classed as intelligent wit.<br /><br />That being said, Fry sets himself up for an enormous fall when he describes his central character as a prodigy of wit. Yet unlike just about any popular thriller writer (eg. Lustbader, Clancy) who claim perceptive, sophisticated heroes but actually paint dumb thugs, Fry comes through above and beyond. The dialogue is constantly sharp, funny, and slap-in-the-face incisive. There are a thousand of the excellent 'Black Adder' style ripostes, and some tougher ones as well. I suppose that's why I've still got the book on my shelf and gave it a 'recommended' rating. For humour and wit it's an easy 'A'; for offensiveness it's an easy 'F'.<br /><br />It's actually very easy to compartmentalise the book. Read it for the wit and the style (unless you just can't cope with flagrant immorality as everyday background).<br /><br />Characters? You'll only get insight into the one character that Fry appears to be interested in: himself. He even describes the sensation of feeling that the rest of the world are just bit players in your own personal drama: a common enough adolescent feeling, but not one I'm sure he's ever shed. I wonder whether he's ever got past the habit of scanning a room and then honing in on the one or two people 'worth talking too'. He's not an out and out misanthrope; rather only a fraction of people in the world are of any interest to him (i.e. the people most like himself who can play with words or, at least, get his word plays because of a shared educational heritage). The central character virtually becomes the only other major character in the book, Trefusis, parroting him in the final scene to a new potential prot&eacute;g&eacute;.<br /><br />Plot? Well, it is interesting that he breaks up the chronology, though not essential. There is also an odd departure: suddenly about three quarters of the way through we're in a spy novel (hinted at in a single teasing aberrant scene in the prologue). It hasn't been woven in to the rest of the story, it's just stuck on the end, and actually quite optional. On its own it's even a bit weak, with a 'and then he woke up' style conclusion that doesn't quite work. But you've been given plenty of other diversions, so you don't mind so much - he might get better at this plot thingy later.u'll only get insight into the one character that Fry appears to be interested in: himself.

Plot, action and dialogue entirely secondary	Initially I was going to give it one or two stars, because it's one of those annoying books that talks about witty dialogue and novel characters without actually containing such dialogue or characterisation. It's a summary, someone looking back over their life, and can get quite windy - despite being relatively short. Plot, action and dialogue are entirely secondary. There may be some insight into certain life stages, but the style doesn't help you to enjoy it.<br />There's some redemption towards the end, where the character moves from youthful egocentrism and arrogance to a love and appreciation for others he'd normally dismiss (such as a cripple), and a more humble perspective of his importance (i.e. he's no more important than anyone else, and history will adjudge it so).<br />There's stuff about coming to terms with that without bitterness or cynicism. Interesting that there's no Christian element to this.<br />Also there is a strong parallel with the journey of Peter Camenzind and that of Siddharta in the novel Hesse released twenty years later. Also reminded me of Plato's Symposium on love, moving from individuals to humanity. After reading Camenzind I'm forced to doubt how far Hesse kept the spirit of the texts on the Buddha when it fits so nicely with his preconceptions. Maybe he'd already got these ideas from Buddhist teachings he'd been exposed to before he wrote Camenzind? Or maybe he's just coincidentally very sympathetic. Or maybe he's projected something inappropriately.	2003-09-22

There is very little dialogue, no humour, hardly any action - just reams of detached description of an academically gifted child's seemingly unfortunate ambition (somewhat fuelled by misguided adults) driving him away from the joys of nature, work and friendship. Apart from, perhaps, the evangelical shoemaker there's no-one here to really enjoy being with, particularly as the condescendingly mature narrator always keeps us removed from them.<br />The kid never really gains my great sympathy, although the story is clearly meant to be tragic. The ending bluntly nails this home with much the same shortcut predictability of a `and then I woke up' finish.	2003-09-22

Wish is a novel in four books, each a layer that takes you somewhere quite different to where you've been. But there's no sacrifice of coherency: unlike just about anyone writing Fantasy series, Goldsworthy had carefully plotted the entire story before finalising the first chapters. As John Regehr said in reviewing Iain Banks' excellent 'Use Of Weapons',<br />'Like all good surprise endings, it enhances the story and makes us rethink it, unlike the Hollywood-style surprise where one walks away feeling puzzled and cheated.'<br />By the time you're confronted it's too late. (By the way, this should warn you not to read on if you don't want to know about the surprise.)<br />Goldsworthy doesn't go for slightly dissonant subtle implications - nor is he at all hesitant to cause offence (indeed, perhaps he relishes it). In 'Honk If You Are Jesus', for example, he didn't merely play with the notion of DNA research cloning Pharlap, or even Shakespeare - he leapt right in with cloning Christ himself. In Wish he leaps right in with bestiality. His 'what if' we finally realise, aghast, is what if we painted the human teacher and ape student as Romeo and Juliet? With a true love, separated by hypocrisy, society and, what?, species-ism.<br />It's too much for me, I'm afraid - this is not just a clever speculation I can toy with. Now I'd have to say that technically, as ever, Goldsworthy has written a fine book. However cleverly, even brilliantly, he did it, he's never going to sell me bestiality as potentially acceptable, either in reality, or even as a purely fantastical idea merely for a potent literary work.<br />If it's the former, that he's really trying to punch home the strongest possible message about animal rights, I can see the logic of his speculation. If the essential difference between animals and people is merely intelligence - and not some other moral feature - then:<br />(a)  to kill and eat them, or experiment on them, is no more justifiable than doing so to low IQ humans;<br />(b)  if science can produce a more intelligent ape, there really is no difference.<br />I suspect that Goldsworthy is a believer in science definitely as opposed to religion, and evolution as opposed to creation: he believes there's no difference. Again, if he's stating this theme as anything more than a novel idea, he differs from this popular stance in his preparedness to take such a conviction to one of its more disturbing moral conclusions, i.e.,<br />(c)  if there really is no difference, there is nothing morally wrong with a person having consensual sex with an animal.<br />I don't think he's so much interested in being the champion of bestiality as using it as the real weapon to confront double standards. In (with typical artistic finesse) presenting us with such a hypothetical example he's saying to those who claim to believe the evolutionary theory that puts humans on a continuum with animals, \\"Why do you react so violently to the concept of bestiality?\\" Very much the device of 'Guess Who's Coming To Dinner': the acid test - would you let one marry your daughter?<br />I suspect the major effect Goldsworthy would hope for, if any apart from writing a good book, would be a greater awareness and willingness to release animals from abuse.<br />Why did he put so much work into painting such a powerful case in an entire novel, rather than penning a discomforting but intriguing speculative short story? Is it that he couldn't bring himself to write throwaway characters? Or that he's an excellent novelist, and couldn't resist an excellent structural idea to hang his characters and ideas on? Or does he really want to see animal rights raised to the level of human ones?<br />By the way, as someone who's in the camp that believes there is a qualitative, spiritual and moral difference between humans and animals (much as I'll, for example, write to MPs to oppose battery hens), I would think Goldsworthy would have a difficulty going with another logical extension of this continuum idea. He's gone, 'if animals and humans are morally indistinguishable, we should treat animals with the same respect and veneration we treat humans'. However, it's just as logical to go:<br />d)  if there really is no difference, there is nothing morally wrong with treating humans the same way we treat animals - or the same way animals treat animals.<br />There's plenty of rape and murder, even cannibalism in the animal world: if we're not to judge lizards and spiders and monkeys for such actions, how can we consistently judge humans for the same actions?<br />Throw out God, make humans merely a clothed ape, deny the soul - and you've got some real difficulties telling anyone about what's 'right' and 'wrong' - even if you're condemning religious fundamentalism - or vivisection. In the times I doubt my own faith it's some sort of cold comfort that the other guys have got at least as many anomalies to offer.<br />As a postscript, it must be mighty frustrating for the deaf community to not be able to recommend such an otherwise palatable and sympathetic introduction to their language - because what follows is more objectionable than anything I've read since a Gor novel trying to legitimise rape (perhaps more objectionable, because Goldsworthy has much greater persuasive talent at his disposal and can't be simply dismissed as a fool). The opening chapters show his considerable skills in presenting the central character J.J., the hearing son of deaf parents: sign is his first and preferred language. Most other authors would have glossed over this as incidental exposition, or, conversely, have laboured his saintly status to better their later theme - but Goldsworthy patiently paints a 'real' person, and takes (almost to the point of becoming a sign primer) much time showing that the deaf are not to be patronised and pitied because they can't hear spoken English. Rather the hearing miss out on an often superior language.gical extension of this continuum idea.

Supposedly great characters uninspiring	Without the novelty of the original, there's not a lot to recommend this (first of many) sequels. For all the self-doubt &amp; confusion of Paul, Alia, and Duncan's ghost, the characters are largely one dimensional. Herbert somewhat falls under the weight of his purportedly eon shaking majestic characters who rarely say or do anything clever or wise (particularly the Reverend Mothers here and in 'Dune', who are supposed to have the insight of millennia, but are essentially ineffective, even pathetic).<br />While the plot does offer an interesting unifying twist, there's far too much irritating (cf. C.J. Cherryh, particularly 'Rusalka') vacillation about choices. We're meant to be carried along in the tide of mysticism, but it just becomes some vague hocus pocus to excuse any arbitrary action or excess of confused introspection.<br />Some Messianic parallels: the disciples were, granted, confused when Jesus saw things so differently; Paul sees his destiny in sacrifice to save others, and is brave enough to do it. But we don't have the attractive wisdom and love of the real deal. Nor do we see the teaching result in good fruit; rather it's never even really addressed why Paul has this genocidal Jihad beyond his control - he's either not bright or not humanitarian enough to end it.	2003-09-22

Sloppy.<br />The teaser short story prequel I read, Debt of Bones (in one of the Legends anthologies), was excellent: original ideas, grand, tight, dramatic...<br />This, the first in a series of standard package 500 page epic fantasy (dragons, swords and cleavage on the covers), starts well, but starts to wane, then to irritate, and then you wonder whether you'll bother finishing (I'm not keeping the book, nor, obviously, going on with the series). A pity: the idea of a central character that walks in to a bad situation and changes it with insight and power into a just one is attractive (I don't think I've seen anyone do it better than Orson Scott Card in one or two chapters of Speaker for the Dead). However, Richard Cypher just walks in and randomly changes things at no personal cost.<br />Far too many pages: the plot just becomes utterly random. Not only has he got a bad case of the David Eddings' (every key character has godlike powers), he constantly contradicts the attributed powers by suddenly making his characters inexplicably vulnerable. One minute they can casually defeat something cosmic and huge, the next one or two of them will be in dire threat from some minor, well known (within that world) character who pops in and out with no reference to a wider plot. Oh, and how often do we think we've heard about the real enemy, when out of the blue we're supposed to be terrified at some silly tangent (\\"Oh no, the mud people\\"; \\"Oh dear, the wicked witch,\\"; \\"Crikey, it's a gar...\\"). It just goes on and on, and you're supposed to be overwhelmed each time - and save yourself for a big climax.<br />By mid way through the book it's clear that Goodkind just doesn't care. Suddenly a character has this miraculous power that we haven't heard about yet. Blimey, here's a nice dragon. It's just too easy. Nothing costs anything - very Eddings.<br />Maybe, just maybe, you could forgive it as pulp teen thing: they can be carried along by the action, who needs a shred of coherence or character.

Goodkind is trying to set something up like that with Kahlan and Richard, but we all know they'll get together, because rules really mean nothing, and there is no cost (likewise Eddings blithely throws around immortality with his characters).<br />(Did I mention that there's no cost?

It's worth reading, OK (and did pick up both a Hugo and a Nebula, so it's not just my opinion).<br />The first third to half of this felt like you were sitting in a taut, well made thriller film. Virgil is a classic tool to set up an action/slight SF plot - a gifted geneticist, socially inept, is caught out doing shonky private research on the company time, and in a classy scene told he has two hours to destroy all his stuff. He manages to hide the most crucial enhanced 'learning' cells he's been working on, but eventually can only smuggle them out by injecting them in his own body - a crazy act, but he can't bear the thought of losing years of successful research. The stuff will probably die anyway, although of course it shouldn't have been let out of carefully quarantined conditions. All this presented skilfully, with the pseudo-scientific dialogue (how would I know) not abusing your suspension of disbelief.<br />Of course weird things start happening, and he calls on his friend (and seeming ideal hero vehicle), Edward, a Doctor and Harrison Ford style intelligent and resourceful (but still sort of everyman) figure. Has Virgil potentially unleashed a deadly virus? And who are these suspicious CIA types in the background - there was actually defence research secretly happening at Virgil's lab: are we squaring off for a standard little man against the establishment, using his wits to unravel the mystery while on the run, finally using whatever the discovery is to cleverly resolve the book? There's even a powerful potential mini-resolution relatively early on that Bear could have built up to as a satisfactory conclusion.<br />I would have enjoyed that, and I'm pretty sure he could have pulled it off nicely.<br />But the novel veers. First into, 'Oh, ok, he's sliding into Spiderman territory: the microbes in Virgil's body are reconstructing him, making him invulnerable to disease, attractive to women, and giving him superhuman powers.' Again, not what I was expecting, but, sure, lets run with it.<br />But then the novel careers. We've got a plague on our hands - that casually wipes out North America in a couple of days. We're now in a holocaust novel following around a few anomalous survivors. Meanwhile, over in Europe, a researcher has bravely taken his infection to an isolation tank so he can be studied as he dies. He starts communicating with the cells within him - they are intelligent and myriad.<br />The scope just keeps growing - now the cells are challenging our view of humanity: they're more like an alien species with Godlike powers. It's an odyssey, with basic questions about reality and life and identity.<br />Quite a ride - a writer who could put out a very decent thriller who is an SF thinker at heart - he keeps on throwing in new, 'Yeah, but what if's' along the way, any one or two of which would probably sustain a whole other book for someone else. We do lose out a bit on character, perhaps, because of this, but the people are not gallingly one dimensional, and are enjoyable as the sort of larger than life people you'd expect to meet in a decently cast slick film. Somehow, while not being as tight as it could have been, the book manages to cohere while wildly changing direction.to disease, attractive to women, and giving him superhuman powers.'

US	34705979	R1J4V0PODBKSMP	0446517801	468411829	Tripoint	Books	1	14	26	N	N	Melodramatic bilge	After picking this up in a 2nd hand bookstore I soon realised I'd read it before, but the few pages I flicked through here and there seemed engaging enough without sending too much detail of the book flooding back into my mind. Moreover I was aware that I'd listed over half a dozen of her books on my shelves/website without reviewing any, and the ratings varied fairly significantly.<br /><br />What did I like about her that saw me bother to seek out so many books? What turned me off so much after a while?<br /><br />Well, after reading Tripoint again I'm more aware of what I dislike about her writing, but scratching a bit for the positives. I remember that I did enjoy The Chronicles of Morgaine, and there are some similarities: both books feature powerful, driven women with virtually none of the traditional softer attributes - these having been cauterised by previous trauma - and the narrative follows men under their shadow, tortured souls coming to terms with years of being outcasts and scapegoats within their own families. The settings that they inhabit are capably sketched, and the psuedo-science consistent enough within the standard suspension of disbelief parameters. But if Morgaine is worth another look, that had better be where the similarities end.<br /><br />A major flaw is the classic of characters being described as superlatively intelligent, honest, resourceful, perceptive etc. but not actually saying or doing anything to live up to their billing. Marie, an unparalleled stock market wizard who's supposed to have centred her whole life and considerable skills on taking revenge on her rapist, has not in over twenty years even found out where he runs his shipping business (public information) or what he buys and sells - let alone targeted him in the market. She's actually done nothing at all, and the novel opens with her ship (which she essentially captains because she makes all the financial decisions that dictate what it carries and where it goes) just happening to arrive at the same port as her nemesis - total coincidence. Why did she totally ignore him until then? Even if you granted that what with hyperspace travel and consequent differing temporal lines their chances of meeting were this small (this still doesn't explain why, with motive and ability, she left it to chance), surely she's been carefully planning for that day and will cooly bring her master-plan into action. No - instead she just runs blindly about the station causing nothing but harm to her cause. This might be plausible if painted as an emotional post-traumatic overreaction, but we're never meant to question her self-possession and skill! These contradictions are constant, such as a line that has her in communication with her brother (nominal captain of the ship) on an open channel giving a short answer, with the narrator's observation saying that she was always so circumspect in speech because it drove him crazy and never gave him any ammunition. This after every second scene involving the two of them is a screaming public argument, with Marie bringing up all manner of personal grievances without provocation. Intelligent? Controlled? Focussed?<br /><br />This goes even further with the main character, Thomas Bowe-Hawkins, the unwanted offspring of Bowe's rape of Marie Hawkins. We're regularly told of his intelligence and honesty, which is somehow suddenly manifest to everyone he meets - despite him consistently doing stupid things and lying to most everyone he meets. There's also a big dose of that Enid Blyton child adventure thing where the child walks into a school or a holiday camp or whatever and suddenly they're the focus of everyone: people who've had other friends for some reason now confide instead in the hero; workers who've been doing fine for years inexplicably are now totally dependant on the newcomer. This might be permissible as some of the innocent Adrian Mole type delusional self-centredness of kids, but Tripoint is supposed to be adult fiction. It's simply absurd that a junior officer from another ship - ignominiously abducted to keep him quiet when he bumbled on some semi-legal activity - within days is the closest confidant of Capella, the most crucial member of the entire staff, and the life partner of another senior crew-member (the latter, apparently an impeccable reader of character - just totally devotes herself to him after a few minutes, where nothing in the dialogue begins to warrant even perhaps a crush). Not to mention having everyone else tying themselves in knots.<br /><br />Cherryh, much as Donaldson in his utterly awful Gap novels, wants to make every conversation and every relationship cataclysmic. The obvious weakness of doing this, particularly when the book revolves essentially around a single character, is that if one relationship is so central, how can another just blithely displace it (and another, and another)? We have a few chapters painting a picture (and outright stating) that Tom is entirely defined by his mother and her programmed hatred of Bowe, but within hours of him being placed on Bowe's ship she and her vendetta are utterly forgotten. She pops in for a couple of pages at the end where, I kid you not, the conversation runs:<br />\\"So? Marie said. \\"You staying with [Bowe]?\\"<br />\\"Yes,\\" he said. \\"--Met a girl, Marie.\\"<br />\\"A girl.\\" Marie snorted. \\"You damn fool.\\"<br />\\"Yeah. I know.

Lewis' Screwtape Letters are wildly ignorant. Lewis used the fantastic (in both senses) idea of dialogue between devils to make profound observations challenging his readers' double standards and assumptions with great wit. Elwood, in contrast, with clumsy schoolboy writing technique, tries to confirm every ignorant self-satisfied middle-American nominal in their bigotry - particularly nasty in someone claiming to endorse Jesus' teaching.<br />Much of the profundity of the Letters is the way that they strikingly show that in the 'small' moral decisions we constantly make grave and eternal implications follow. Lewis' senior Devil constantly upbraids his rash understudy for his attempts to be melodramatic and overblown. Subtlety is the key - deceit: you don't need to damn a soul by terrifying them with atrocities, you're probably better off distracting them at a crucial point with a nice lunch or a transient newspaper headline.<br />Elwood does the opposite. He, at best immaturely, at worst, deceptively, presents spiritual conflicts as relating only to a sensational fraction of the population. Where Lewis made one pause and uncomfortably realise, \\"This could be me,\\" Elwood has ignorant people going, \\"Yes, that sounds like them.\\" Lewis was keenly aware of the audience who would be reading his work and sought to challenge and move them, at times with humour, at others with great courage - and usually with a combination of the two: the characters he gently (and at times sharply, but always lovingly) exposes are the same middle-class, nice, educated people like himself who'd be reading such a book. Elwood, however, writes (with consummate ignorance) about, for example, how bad and criminally insane all junkies are, condemning those already judged by his glib readers: he is the Pharisee calling out to other Pharisees, 'Thank God I'm not like this tax collector and sinner.'<br />To stay with the junkie example, Elwood manages a breathtakingly offensive line to someone who cares about Jesus' teaching. When in laughable melodramatic fashion the user is stereotypically driven to armed robbery and shot by his own stereotypically 'good cop' father (the book ingenuously tries to sell this sort of utterly transparent device as hard-edged realism) what is seen as the tragedy of this death has nothing to do with eternity (something Jesus seemed to feel quite important). Why is it tragic?<br />  \\"...He wasn't just any computer programmer; He could have been another Bill Gates, a Steve Jobs.\\"<br />Isn't it tragic that he wasn't hugely successful in the world's eyes and values, but, instead, failed in the world's terms by not making millions and having proud parents.

US	34705979	R1W3AD3GNUMEL1	0440220602	233513923	The Chamber	Books	3	16	18	N	N	Original, interesting legal info, flawed thematicatically	I was well aware of the popularity of Grisham before reading anything by him, and was quite surprised that such a 'bestseller' didn't fall into a formula plot. Admittedly he was well established before publishing this one - maybe the others are more conventionally pleasing?<br />There are hints of thriller, and (in my mind) pretty much the assumption of a dramatic courtroom climax, but while either would have fitted easily with the content of the book, Grisham rejects them both.<br />Rather the novel centres entirely on the anatomy of the final days before an execution. There's actually very little action to speak of, but a lot of dialogue, and reams of detailed narration of physical and judicial institutions. Rather than the pieces of the crime gradually being revealed, with a savage and vital twist forcing the pace, the opening chapters of the book simply relate precisely what happened in a neutral tone, revealing to three decimal places the exact degree of guilt of the defendant. So instead of the standard adrenaline ride of tracking down the 'real' guilty parties while dodging bullets and falling in love, we already know most of the salient details in the first few chapters.<br />What takes the book beyond being little more than a dramatised documentary is the personal/family aspect of our young hotshot lawyer (Adam) actually getting to know his ex-KKK grandfather (Sam) while representing him. How did some of these awful things go on in his family? How does the perpetrator feel about them now? Characters appear and recede only as far as they relate to the final days on this death row case. Several seemingly central characters turn out to be red herrings - or, at least, they would if this was a whodunit. However as a detailed narration of a few weeks it feels more authentic to have them come and go as the lawyer tries and then dismisses various tangents in the so called 'gangplank' appeals.<br />While at times he does push his luck with the amount of words devoted to relating precise architecture and procedures on death row, the documentary aspect generally enhances the book. I find it a real asset when the author painlessly incorporates information about something the they're an expert on and/or have researched thoroughly (cf. philosophy/literature in just about any David Lodge, rigging in Levi's 'The Wrench').<br />There is some suspense - this is a life and death situation revolving around appeals that will be judged - but a strength of the book is that it doesn't rely on the dramatic final judgement to make it worth reading.<br />The major weakness, however, is its attempt to convince us of the invalidity of the death penalty. It is utterly transparent that key characters that oppose it are the salt of the earth, but anyone in favour has some basic character flaw (such as the slimy two-faced politician, or the martinet prison guard - blimey, what original characterisations), or is an embittered victim unable to be objective. This is a particular shame because there are a surprisingly large number of positive characters that aren't mere throwaways. Moreover the essential way the reader is supposed to be convinced of the moral corruptness of the bad guys is that the heroic ones don't like them - rather than what they actually say and do. Grisham even tries to reverse this - the reader, for example, is supposed to wryly laugh along with the clever tactic of the good-guys to commit wholesale fraud by inundating the governor's phones with impersonated constituents opposing to the death penalty; this strategy is no better than someone stealing ballot boxes, for example, but we're meant to swallow and even enjoy it, with a vague justification that the end justifies the means.<br />But while some of his self-conscious methods of arguing against execution fail, it's a real irony that the actual resolution of the book is ingenuously a strong argument in favour of death row. It's the salvation of the fallen criminal. What Grishamdoesn't seem to realise is that he constantly feeds Sam lines that endorse the redemptive effect of knowing that he's going to die soon. Because of the imminence of death Sam says he 'values life' more than he used to - which enables him to realise the wrongness of violent acts he'd previously felt no remorse for. With the clock ticking Sam writes genuine letters of apology to all his victims which would never have happened without such a threat. Indeed he repents in a staggering straight from a gospel tract scene, opening up to the priest because, in light of the chamber, he wants to make his peace. (This conversion, by the way, while doctrinally sound, is soon clarified as a classic nominal middle American one as Sam says to Adam:<br />I look at you- you're tolerant and broad-minded, well-educated, ambitious, going places - and I ask myself, Why didn't I become ... something like you.'<br />That being said, while Grisham can't help but tack some worldly success onto the inimical teaching of Christ, his presentation of the evangelical priest is startlingly positive, and there are some 'money's not worth integrity' intimations here and there).<br />To convince his audience that it was wrong to send an utterly unrepentant killer - who'd do the same again without remorse given half a chance - to the chair would have been a difficult task. Alternatively Grisham has the intelligence not to present an innocent character wrongfully going to the gas chamber as his argument against execution: that's merely against poor judicial processes. Instead he tries the middle ground of presenting a guilty but redeemed figure. But when the catalyst - or even cause - of that enlightenment is the chamber itself, the moral to this tale is hardly one opposing it.risham doesn't seem to realise is that he constantly feeds Sam lines that endorse the redemptive effect of knowing that he's going to die soon.

As it is I've read enough stuff influenced by what I imagine must have been Gibson's ground breaking style for it not to have been so surprising.<br />It would have been a double for originality: playing with Artificial Intelligence, virtual reality, bio-technological implants - bodies as open slather for drug and neurological tampering ... PLUS ... post-modern characters, not exactly sure what's going on, detached from relationships, not particularly noble, set in a future that's the antithesis to the stereotyped antiseptic, uniform, civilised ones of 50s TV. 'The Matrix', for example, is straight out of this.<br />So, sure, a B+. He's clever and (was) original.<br />But it didn't take me right away because I didn't really like any of the pretty much shallow characters. They didn't make me laugh or feel - they don't go any deeper than a novel video game ('Say, watch this cool stunt'). Take away the novelty and there's not a lot there that I enjoyed.	2003-09-01

Nothing more, nothing less. There are so many in this genre, but most have some annoying weaknesses - random or lazy plotting (Goodkind, at times Martin), repetitive techniques in dialogue (Eddings), supposedly smart or witty characters being dumb or bland (Herbert), voyeurism (Lieber), paper thin cliche settings (Cook) - the list goes on.<br />Gemmel doesn't put a foot wrong; he keeps a marvelous balance. The characters are consistent, the plot doesn't become too unwieldy, the sex and violence don't become utterly gratuitous, the underlying world and mythos are robust enough to support the cast, there are no implausible clangers in the action, things are neither too easy nor too hard for our heroes - it's very satisfying and easy to roll along with.<br />That being said, he never soars - there's nowhere that the dialogue is stingingly good or the ideas really brilliant. The characters are not going to touch our souls so deeply, but, hey, they're mythic heroes, we're not reading this sort of escapist fiction to grapple with our relationship with our parents or something: the final part of the book has some of the hero Hruss' enemies beginning to get philosophical about him, but they step back from the temptation towards such introspection, shake their heads and instead just say, \\"-but he could fight, hey.\\"<br />So the major strength I suppose is the consistency - many other writers could do a chapter or two of this but not make it all hang together for an entire novel (they probably could, though, if they had some ruthless editing - I don't think anyone but Tolkien has written a series that warrents three books unless they make each book a potentially stand alone episode (eg. Saberhagen's Swords series - or even Harry Potter!). While they should be cutting things down into a tight, strong story, they submerge a potentially fine idea in the hundreds of pages, or even multiple books, seemingly demanded by the genre.<br />The book does stand out in two other ways. One is that even though the characters aren't trying to be too relevant (nobody reading or writing this book has ever picked up a sword in anything but a self-conscious recreation), Gemmel bothers to have respectable and disreputable characters on either 'side'. This complements the other place he shines - morally.

In the attempt to convince the fathers he's aiming at that they should invest more time and love on their kids (not a bad thing itself), he makes ridiculous and offensive dismissals, such as: mothers as irrelevant to parenting; any family structure other than nuclear as having only existed in the last generation - dismissing entire continents and ages; and any generation apart from the present one as unimportant.<br />Like I say, you get past this and the macho allusions they're dressed in, and there's some OK advice. However there is also the pernicious subtext that, 'Don't worry if your son is greedy, materialistic and unGodly, just so long as he's straight, gets and stays married, holds down a decent job, and doesn't touch drugs, phew, you've won the war.'	2003-08-15

It could have merely been a thinly veiled essay (and is at times), but in satirising, Elton has written a very decent thriller - ironically at times by introducing the very archetypical characters he's condemning.<br />Add to this his usual sharp comic stand-up perspectives, and you've got a powerful read. It should date given its very specific pop-culture context, but it may even be good enough not to. This book is well put together, underpinned by a dry and incisive wit, has some very impressive satire, and makes some penetrating criticisms in an enormously enjoyable and compelling form.	2003-07-30

The hero falls for the heroine because she's a babe, but this is, of course, classed as a deep and abiding love.

You could see the lecturer still got a buzz talking about pirates on the high seas and the like, and he recommended this incredible recollection of Diaz', a soldier who served with Cortes (this translation's spelling) in the early 1500s, surviving two expeditions from Cuba onto the mainland near Mexico beforehand, and the amazing one afterwards where Cortes, with a few hundred soldiers against tens of thousands of locals, manages to eventually capture (and destroy) the enormously rich and established capital.<br /><br />The style of the book is, consciously, not that of an accomplished writer. Diaz actually abandoned his reminiscences, but resumed them upon reading other accounts that were more stylish but less accurate (he was actually there). There are a hundred scenes and characters in his pages that could be gloriously presented for drama, humour, nobility, tragedy, last minute relief, action, philosophical/ethical debate ... but he just notes things down in a very bland style. But since the content itself is so wild - and (pretty much) factual, you are still interested. Someone else could write (and probably has) a cracking book based on Diaz' facts, but the liberties they'd have to take would probably still leave it as less than the original.<br /><br />This is not to say that Diaz doesn't have biases. However there is a naivety in his writing so that even when, for example, he may be exaggerating just how constantly pious the soldiers were in risking their own lives to oppose the local practise of human sacrifice, you are still well aware of the utter spiritual conviction of the Conquistadors. And they don't hide their lust for gold. Or even for women - somehow they see no contradiction between their Christianity and accepting or even taking local women as wives or concubines. Cortes accepts several it seems, impregnating the odd one - and this is not seen as needing any defence or apology despite him having a Spanish wife at home. There's no need to mistrust much of what he says, because he's not writing to try to appease a modern audience. Rather he's writing for his peers, people with the same convictions as himself, so he's not trying to hide attitudes that he assumes of everyone.<br /><br />But this is much of the game with this text. Everyone now will bring their judgements to it. The most common one students would make today I imagine would be outright condemnation: the Spaniards were nothing more than a (slightly) more organised and resourced bunch of pirates, exploiting the innocent locals for gold, causing massive loss of life, and forcing their own absurd religious beliefs on a populace with their own highly developed religion. And in a lot of ways they would be absolutely right. Yet, for me as a Christian, I can't utterly condemn these guys who did consistently (and strategically unwisely - regarding questing for gold and militarily guaranteeing their own survival) witness to the locals. Cortes regularly risks his own safety by challenging their idolatry and practise of human sacrifice.<br />The latter is condemned as `we're all brothers'. Yet while there was respect shown for the Indians, they were seen as second class - the death of an Indian wasn't seen as nearly as significant as that of a Spaniard. Moreover the move was always towards the best the Indians could hope for was to end up as vassals. But there are contradictions: Diaz earlier condemns someone for contemplating the evil idea of enslaving free men - who were Indians. Yet some Indians who opposed them in battle were branded as slaves.<br /><br />Were the Indians better or worse off after the invasion? Some of them benefited because Mexico was the superpower extracting a brutal tribute of women and riches - the conquistadors capitalised on those disaffected (Cortes was overjoyed when he heard that there was opposition to Montezuma). But it was hardly a simple thing of walking in, blasting off a gun, pointing to your strangely white skin, and having the locals worship you and hand over all their gold. Before they gained any local backing they had to fight against much greater numbers. Their artillery, steel and cavalry helped, of course - but it was hardly a carefully researched, resourced and executed invasion. It was actually a big mess, with courageous/greedy/rash people just grabbing at a half-chance to improve their lot.<br /><br />This was the edge of the empire - pioneer country. The rule of law was pretty thin here. Cortes barely managed to get the backing to put together a small fleet, and he charged out ASAP because he knew the backing would falter at any time (it did, and the governor declared him an outlaw almost as soon as he'd left). Cortes knew he had to make good his chance so that even the king of Spain was impressed, or return to be put in chains. Thus after some very narrow victories when the sensible thing would be to count your blessings, return to base to discuss sensible approaches in the light of much new knowledge, and replenish men and resources ... Cortes torches the fleet! This way no-one CAN turn back and change alliances, they're stuck with Cortes and must be loyal to have any chance of surviving.<br /><br />I'm talking virtually all plot now, but this is History much more than a novel. As a novel it's very poorly written. The thing is essentially content.<br /><br />Back to the question - were the Indians better off? Well, many just exchanged one oppressor for another (that's History say many). But as a Christian, many did learn the truth and were delivered from idolatry (or, in their corrupted version of Christianity, exchanged one idol for another). The human sacrifice practice would have been greatly reduced or even halted. I suppose you'd have to read about the next couple of hundred years to know.imple thing of walking in, blasting off a gun, pointing to your strangely white skin, and having the locals worship you and hand over all their gold.

While on his own professional ground discussing monkey behaviours, and a helpful summary of 'Theory of Mind' (how aware beings are of a) their own identity 'I believe'; and that of others b) 'I believe that you think'; and how deeply you understand their consciousness c) 'I believe that you think that I believe...- these are levels of 'intensionality') there's some interesting reading.<br />But once he diverts into anything outside of that: sociology, linguistics, history - he's a total crackpot theorist - of exactly the ilk of some of the 18th century smug theist scientists he'd pillory. For example, as proof that different languages developed as conscious schemes to identify with one group against another, he tells the biblical story of the shibboleth. This would be OK as an example of what he's talking about, but he invests the story with the notion, 'That's what they did back then,' type generality.<br />There are worse howlers, as when he says that language could never have come from gesture, as gesture is only mime and can never be used symbolically - as if deaf people don't use sign language. To such an objection he says, 'Oh, you couldn't use it at night, so it couldn't be significant.' Whether it is or it isn't, he can be so smug because he's talking about pre-history and will never have to fear disproof. He bandies around millennia as if he really knows, yet avoids rigorous rebuttal because nobody can really know.	2003-06-30

Recollections through the eyes (but not the vocabulary) of a ten year old of family and insects/snakes/birds on Corfu. Funny characterisations, well retold anecdotes of eccentrics (including this biology mad kid). Similarities to Herriot. Interesting that the animal obsessed writer, inspirer of many of today's naturalists, is still of his generation enough to see no tension between being fascinated by animals in this idyllic setting - or going out shooting with his brother.	2003-06-30

Trevise is supposed to be a rigorous scientist of the highest intelligence, and in this novel his quest is to find out why he is always right.<br />Hubris city, but with no ironic undercutting.<br />Worlds and characters are flagrantly constructed merely as 2D sets for the strutting Trevise. His two companions acknowledge his greatness and tread around him accordingly. Pel is a sort of Dr. Watson. Every female is absurdly stylised : vain (jealous of any other female), motherly, and devoted. Oh, and stacked. We're deep in James Bond/Star Trek 1 territory here.<br />There are plenty of contradictions and places where supposedly intelligent characters do stupid things.<br />This is obviously a book written on commission: he didn't have any idea for another Foundation book, let alone a 500 pager, but his publishers wanted the money for a guaranteed seller. Asimov really should stick to short stories where you don't need insight (particularly into character) or imagination, but can get by with a single novel 'what if'. He reveals far too much about himself here, which in some authors is intriguing, but in him is disappointing.	2003-06-30

Tom Clancy.<br />Maybe it has a big turnaround, but I couldn't push myself much past the first hundred pages.<br />Cardboard characters that are described as massively intelligent and resourceful, yet are lucky to exhibit the maturity and insight of adolescents. The arch-villain is supposed to be smart enough to have fooled basically everyone on earth to run a virtual world government, yet he's utterly transparent. Oh, and he casually hits on a sexy reporter, forcing her to sleep with him to get access to a story she wants - as if he's not actually handing her a much bigger story/blackmail threat. It's gratuitously playing to the seedy crowd.<br />The premise is that only our hero and his supporters on the moonbase understand that the new 'nanotechnology' - viruslike micro-organisms that can be used to build rocketships and furniture and cure diseases - is good, but the whole world has been fooled by the villain into thinking they're bad. It only works for that high-school Adrian Mole stage where you do still think that no-one understands except you.<br />Oh, and of course this nanotechnology gibberish means that Bova can suddenly pull out any magic trick - 'hey, they can make us invisible' - as if it's part of a coherent plot. As with fantasies where wizards can suddenly pull out spells we've never heard of at no cost, ultimately there is no suspense. And the only thing going for this book (no character, no humour, no insight, no wit - maybe he does good action that I never got to) is suspense (even down to titling each chapter as a countdown). The SF aspect just gives Bova a chance at a particular market - perhaps wise financially, but he abuses the genre to give more licence to sloppy plotting.	2003-06-30

Poor start. Somewhat farcical fantasy, broad, frequently undergraduate humour (think Black Adder for the coarseness and vocabulary, but without the wit). Almost no attempt to make different races, tribes, lands cohere - protagonist just wanders about bumping into barely two dimensional characters and settings.<br />But ... nice, relatively original broad approach, in two ways.<br />1) The hero just gets buffeted about, little or no control, and definitely little help from the author to propel him onto steadily greater conquests; indeed, he often has no idea what's going on;<br />2) I didn?t actually realise I'd read the first book in the series (The Wizards and the Warlords) until more than half way in. The only way this book integrates is that instead of it being from the view of people making wars and changing events, it's from the view of someone just bowled along beside and in them, generally with no idea what's going on. Eventually you realise the events are the ones you read about in book one, but you, like the central character, also have no idea and are just getting through trying to survive. One chapter foregrounds this, the narrator saying that, were the protagonist more articulate, in addressing the role of the individual in history he?d state:<br />'History is what we understand. The rest is a waking nightmare. History is the explanation of who holds the knife. Without that explanation, all we understand is the pain.'<br />I remember being annoyed at the beginning of the first book at the way Cook blithely has a 3000 year old wizard die because he does some stupid things - that anyone who'd survived for a fraction of that time would have the nous not to do. But he's all about demystifying heroes, saying they do do stupid things at times.<br />He gets better once he gets into a book. His strengths are escaping the formula success story plots, and rare things like the last quote have some profundity, particularly in the context. In 'A Game of Thrones' George R.R. Martin was likewise willing to let his heroes unexpectedly suffer or even die, but he also built a grand, unified mythology/realm with some cohesive history (as opposed to random ideas), and created some decent characters.gs like the last quote have some profundity, particularly in the context.

Banks feels so comfortable and natural in what he's talking about, although he could easily sound nerdy or as if he's trying to show off with so many contemporary technology references.<br /><br />There's a bit of a background thriller plot of some covert illuminati 'Business' of vast wealth, power and history, but it is largely that, just background. The foreground is the ramblings and reflections of the central character, a technology investment advisor in her late 30s. She's smart and won't compromise her views to flatter anyone, despite stating them with wit and respect. We get to like her and some of her close friends, and are buoyed along by settings and activities of outrageous extravagance and opulence.<br /><br />I found the thriller ending a bit unconvincing: I suspect Banks doesn't want to insult his readers by spelling it out too much (something which makes him far more enjoyable to spend time with that the usual blunt Clancy's et. al), but the crucial 'clue' to me seemed pretty weak. Also our heroine seemed foolish in her final confrontation - just created a powerful foe without giving herself any protection as far as I could see.<br /><br />But if we leave the thriller conclusion aside (which we can with Banks), the ride is quite enjoyable enough on its own. There's a bit of the 'noble savage' myth happening with the visit to a poorer country, but it's still interesting that he even bothers to juxtapose the two worlds. Banks seems to enjoy playing with cool characters with massive wealth and power, the most extreme I've seen being the 'culture' of some of his excellent SF novels (when he adds his middle initial 'M' to differentiate), but it's also there with his millionaire bassist in Espedair Street.	2003-06-27
US	34705979	R127SZL90G5QS5	0749309903	869717247	The Gnole	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Some nice ideas but inconsistent	Hard to grade and classify this one - as close as I can remember is Duncton Wood, although there are X-files type conspiracy and supernatural/horror elements..<br />Fungle the Gnole is the ultimate new age environmental Dalai Lama. He's a laughing rustic who benignly cuts through pretensions. Almost (but not quite) cloying sentimentality in presenting the beatific integration with nature, various spirits of the wood, and with the simple community. Also a background something akin to the sadness of the Elves gradually giving over to the teaming nature-despoiling chaotic spread of humanity.<br />Starts setting up a standard fantasy baddie-goodie sorcery story (although the baddie is more from the horror genre, being a demon and all - a strength of the book is its underlying pantheon), then cuts to a million pop-culture references as Fungle encounters TV personalities and evil covert Govt. departments. Some OK playing with the innocent's alternative perspective on our everyday, but it's basically pretty self-indulgent.<br />But finally Aldridge lost me with his rough-diamond underground gangsters: we're supposed to enjoy their high spirits, but the fact that they enjoy throwing defenceless people to be torn to pieces by crocodiles as an afternoon's amusement made me unclear on the difference between them and the villain. Moreover one minute our hero can effortlessly use telepathy, astral travelling, levitation and sorcery, the next he's inexplicably running scared from any old security guard or mugger.<br />Some original ideas, generally capably presented, an OK overall plot/world, and some likeable central characters - but the book is inconsistent thematically and qualitatively. A bit lax in bothering for coherency: characters are added fairly randomly as we go on.	2003-06-27
US	34705979	R34JWNUATCLHAO	0207172390	335333511	To Make a Killing (Blacklist)	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Average, and a bit smug	After relishing a couple of Perez-Reverte novels I'm experimenting with this genre, so I'm going through a list of crime authors from a pamphlet at the local library. Amusing coincidence that just grabbing the first author alphabetically on the list gave me a story set in and around my home town of Nowra. Several enjoyable local references - almost enough to be a mere selling gimmick - but not profound insights into the soul of the area.<br />The plot meanders along OK, with events racing to a standard sensational climax with virtually no falling action. Bedford overuses the same techniques to remind us how she defines cool: her heroine is constantly enjoying European food and wine, and has an absurd amount of baths. There's also a fairly unsubtle pushing of values - a mandatory casual sex encounter, ticking boxes about aborigines and the environment, and a pretty outrageous italicised instruction to the reader about how to judge a lesbian relationship, 'Good, they make a fine couple those two.' As if that wasn't enough, Bedford ladles it on with the plot: Lesbians are the sort of people who lovingly look after the mentally disabled - whereas constructionalists are nazis who want to kill them, gottit?<br />The characters aren't quite wafer thin - but I suspect we're getting a reflection of a fairly shallow perception of the author. While the heroine at one point states something like, 'If I learned one thing in my business, people are always more complex than a first impression can tell you,' the book totally negates it. People never surprise us and are rigidly classed as goodies and baddies. And the political correctness is pretty stifling: we're very clearly told, for example, what to think about constructionalists and environmentalists.<br />So, no, I haven't found another Perez-Reverte, and would probably only have enjoyed it if my smug view of the world corresponded more closely to that of Bedford.	2003-06-27
