You know how so many authors write a fantastic first novel but seem to loose something along the way?  How subsequent books never quite live up to that first one?  I'm happy to say, this is not the case with Evans.  I'll be honest.... I've never read the HORSE WHISPERER.  I own it and have seen the movie several times, but after making many promises (to myself) to read it, for one reason or another, I just haven't gotten around to it (I did start it a long time ago & have read bits & pieces to compare it to the movie - I do know that the book has an entirely different ending!).     Even tho I've never read HORSE WHISPERER cover to cover, I do know that Nicholas Evans is a fantastic author & THE HORSE WHISPERER is considered by most to be his best piece of work.    I did read his last novel, SMOKE JUMPER (HC release 2001).  I loved that book, thought it was extremely well written and looked forward to reading future novels from this author.  Once I heard a release date was set for THE DIVIDE, I added it to my Wishlist & counted down the days to its release.  SMOKE JUMPER is ranked among my favorite novels and after reading it, Evans became one of my favorite authors.  I'm happy to say, THE DIVIDE did not disappoint me & has solidified Evans' place among my favorite authors.      When I first read the summary of this book, I wasn't entirely sure it was going to be my \\"cup of tea.\\"  Even after I started reading the first chapter or so - it seemed like it was very slow going, and I had a feeling I would be putting it away in order to read another book.  Thankfully, I stuck it out, and once the story got going, I found it very hard to put it down.      Evans devotes a lot of time & attention to each of the main character's backgrounds, and by the time I finished reading it, I felt as if I personally knew each one of them.  The book was an extremely emotional read, which builds with each chapter and ends on a very powerful note.  I don't think any other (fictional) book I've ever read left me with the same types of feeling and emotion I had once I finished this book.  Having raised my own teenage daughter & a younger son, I could easily identify with Benjamin & Sarah in so many ways.  Mistakes are made, regrets are had, and the extremes they go to protect their children will leave many parents asking themselves what they might do if found in a similar situation.  The many emotions and roller coaster rides that parents experience are explored in great detail, but what is evident in every chapter, on every page is the love they share for their children, and even at the worst of times, each other.      This is definitely not considered a \\"lightweight\\" read, and will possibly exhaust some readers emotionally.  This could have been the headline story taken from the front page of any current US newspaper.  I think it's entirely worth the journey however, and I'm so grateful that Evans decided to tell a story like this.  If I have any complaints about the book, it would be that Sarah's \\"happily ever after\\" seemed a bit forced and a little unbelievable.  Other than that, I thought the story was very powerful and heartfelt, uplifting and sad, and once I was done, I felt like I had taken a journey that no parent ever wants to travel through, but one that they should definitely be aware of.      I highly recommend this book - to fans of Evans and parents everywhere.  The subject matter should not be taken lightly, and will give many readers pause for thought, however, I don't think anyone will regret their time spent at THE DIVIDE, and will close the book after reading the final chapter, a little bit wiser and a little more observant. They may even want to give their kids a hug and remind them of how much they are loved.      Looking forward to the next book from Nicholas Evans - I just hope we don't have to wait four more years! If his next book is anywhere near as good as THE DIVIDE, however, it will definitely have been worth the wait!	2005-10-01
US	51661790	R2P1J3FN5K99UA	0553587625	274631081	Summer's Child	Books	3	2	2	N	N	You're sorta "tricked" into buying the author's next book!	Let me start this review by preparing you ahead of time - even tho readers may finish this book, the story will be incomplete. Readers are sort of \\"tricked\\" into buying (or at least reading) SUMMER OF ROSES which was released 6/21 (about 4 weeks after this book). This is the first time Luanne Rice has written a book which has a directly related sequel or follow-up - It's more like Parts 1 and 2, however, as there is still so much left to this story, and I highly doubt that most readers will be \\"satisfied\\" with the ending of SUMMER'S CHILD. Even tho I buy every one of Luanne Rice's books, I'm not too happy about the fact that I'm sort of forced into it, and have no choice but to buy the book the day of its release. (I'm certainly not going to let more than a week go by before I find out what happens next!) <br /> <br />With that out of the way, SUMMER'S CHILD returns to the Luanne Rice we all know and love. Thank Goodness SILVER BELLS was just a \\"fluke.\\" (I was kind of worried!). In typical Luanne Rice fashion, girl is in trouble, boy plays \\"hero\\" to the girl, boy loves girl but is afraid to tell her, girl loves boy but is afraid to tell him, child in middle knows the adults belong together & tries like heck to put them together, a crises arises forcing boy & girl together, girl & boy finally admit their feelings for one another and......... <br /> <br />That's it!! We won't know the rest until we finish SUMMER OF ROSES!!  <br /> <br />Luanne Rice writes about relationships with a passion. Readers have characters to actually root for and care about and love is a high priority. Sentiment runs high in a Luanne Rice novel which never fails to tug at your heartstrings, but readers aren't reading these books for the scenery! (which, in this novel is a beautiful, peaceful and far-removed waterside community in Nova Scotia). A very close circle of friends support the main charcters, with the occassional reference to characters from previous Luanne Rice novels (Tara & Bay, Lilly's childhood friends from PERFECT SUMMER from are mentioned, as are other past characters). The author pays very close attention to details, and I appreciate the research that she must do to bring important information to light (readers will get a valuable lesson in internet fraud, heart disease in children, as well as whale watching) <br /> <br />SUMMER'S CHILD includes everything we've come to expect from a Luanne Rice novel. No surprises here (other than the fact that the story doesn't end with this book - for the first time the author chose to contnue the story in her next HC release). Fans of Rice should be pleased with this story and, I'm assuming, its continuation SUMMER OF ROSES. As a usual, this is pretty much \\"required\\" Beach Reading!! <br /> <br />I for one, am anxiously waiting to purchase my copy so that I can see what happens next and how the characters move forward. Once I've finished that book - I'll be able to write a more detailed review! <br /> <br />I give the story 4 stars, but becuz the story's incomplete and reader's are pretty much forced into buying (and reading) SUMMER OF ROSES, I give the book itself 2 stars - which averages out to a 3 star review! <br /> <br />p.s. the one thing I think the author could have ommitted from this story was the reference to Lacey & Scott Peterson - I don't really think it was necessary to associate his real life tragedy with the characters of a fictional novel! While I appreciate the occassional reference to true-life events in the novels I read, this particular reference felt both forced and unnecessary, only serving to state the author's view on the subject. In the future, I think it's best to leave true-life, personal tragedies out of fictional novels. I'm reading a novel for pleasure, not to get views on such a horrible event - If I wanted that, I'd pick up the newspaper or watch the news!	2005-07-12
US	51661790	R3C5UEJC0XA66I	1400061601	903036312	The Year of Pleasures: A Novel	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Something was missing - Maybe the rest of the story?	I really enjoy reading Elizabeth Berg's books.  One reason is that from the suburbs of Chicago myself, I like being able to pick out the real places and sites she oftens refers to in her books.  More than this, however, I enjoy reading the stories of mature women in real life situations (altho I do enjoy the occassional \\"chick-lit\\"!).   <br /> <br />I was looking forward to this year's release, and after reading a few reviews, it seemed to hold a lot of promise.  Once I started reading it,  however, I had a very difficult time getting involved with the story.  I even stopped reading about 2/3 of the way through in order to read another book (something I rarely do!)  I did come back, however, and finally finished, but I wasn't very enthusiastic about it.   <br /> <br />It really seemed like something was missing - as if there was so much more to this story.  Some of the events were a little unbelievable, and too many things were left \\"hanging\\" - Are we supposed to believe that the \\"voices\\" that came to Beta each night - disruptive enough to cause her to leave her own home! - were actually caused by a radio left on in the attic???  This just doesn't seem like typical Elizabeth Berg writing. <br /> <br />I would have loved to seen more involvement and more of a story between Beta & her college friends.  It seems like it was just skimmed over, and it didn't make much sense to include it.  Why were these characters even introduced, if we were never even going to get to know them?? <br /> <br />What happened with her neighbor, and the women she purchased the house from? Did Matthew finally stand up to is rude GF?  And what was the point of her husband's \\"notes\\"?  So many stories seemed incomplete - is there going to be a sequel?? <br /> <br />What was included within this book was an enjoyable read, however, I never got involved with the characters and never felt emotionally invested.  I get the feeling that the author didn't either - that this may not have been a pleasure for her to write (was it actually a \\"Year of Pleasures\\" while the author was writing this?) It almost seems like the story was rushed, or the author felt obligated to publish a story before it was really ready.  I don't know if this is the case, but I hope the next book from Elizabeth Berg is more emotional with characters to care about, or I may not be too interested in reading it.	2005-06-15

No one can write about women, for women better (in my opinion!!).  A GOOD YARN is no different from any of her other books on this subject.  It's not her best novel (BETWEEN FRIENDS has that honor!), but it's certainly a pleasant read, and would make the perfect \\"beach companion\\"  or poolside read this summer.    The book is a sequel (or follow-up) to last year's SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET, with the story revolving aroud the main character and shop's owner, Lydia.  This year's knitting class teaches us how to make a pair of socks (an actual pattern is included inside the book), while Lydia meets and becomes friends with a new group of three women.  The three characters from last year's book (students from her first knitting class) make  \\"cameo\\" appearances, but the story focuses on Lydia and her three new students.       Written from the point of view of all four characters, the chapters once again alternate between narrators (which is actually typical for a Debbie Macomber novel).  While this can become confusing or even a nuisance under the pen of other writers, Debbie Macomber does it flawlessly and effortlessly, so that readers get to know each character on an intimate level, and can actually see themselves becoming with friends with one or all of all of the book's main characters.    Lydia is the shop owner and the one who brings these women together (through her knitting classes which she offers at her shop).  After battling illness for most of her life, she's given a clean bill of health and finally found, what she believes is true love with Brad (the handsome UPS guy!) and has made a connection with & become much closer to her sister, whom she has battled with for nearly as long as she's battled her illness.    Bethane is a recently divorced mother of two, who is learning how to live life on her own, discovering who she is, and what it is she can offer to those around her, all the while trying to deal with the emotional roller coster her children are on due to the divorce.  Elise is also divorced, whose gambling ex-husband comes to town to re-accquaint  himself with their now grown and married daughter, while trying to mend the fences with the one & only woman he's ever really truly loved.  Courtney is a teen-aged girl who is new in town and has recently come to stay with her grandmother.  After losing her mother in a car accident, her father to his work, and her siblings to marriage, Courtney must deal with a new school, making new friends, and all the other trials & tribulations that all teens go through, all without the guidance of a parent close by to lead the way.  Each character has their own individual story to tell, while at the same time, we see how their paths cross and how each affects one another's life and help each other along.    The stories are fairly predictable, yet the familarity of each character with their trimumphs and tragedies makes this a comfortable, enjoyable read that most readers will certainly identify with and feel like one of the friends in the book.  I'm sure many will be wishing that a similar shop existed in their own neighborhood!    My only \\"negative\\" thought about this book, and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that I felt the characters & stories were too similar and parallel to the characters & stories of last year's SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET.  While most of Debie Macomber's books have a familar feeling to them, since most deal with the friendships of women and are often told in a similar way, I'd prefer to meet new charcters with new stories and go on a new journey.  It didn't make this book any less enjoyable, it just left me with a feeling of \\"been there, done that.\\"     I still think Debbie Macomber is one of the best authors of women's fiction today, and her stories and characters feel very real with many true-to-life experiences.  If you enjoy stories about the love of friends and family with a little romance thrown in, you're certain to enjoy any one of Debbie Macomber's HC releases.    You don't have to have read SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET to enjoy this book, but it will certainly help fill in some of the blanks.  Once you've finished this book, if you're left wanting more, I highly recommend BETWEEN FRIENDS, which was written by Debbie Macomber and released about two years ago - it remains one of my favorite books of all time!	2005-05-21
US	51661790	RFIE1B2LJN6W8	0765304058	732033822	The Forever Year	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Wonderful first novel - Fans of N. Sparks, take notice!	Let me start by saying that Nicholas Sparks is my absolute favorite author.  I have read every one of  his novels immediately upon their release.  Since he usually only publishes one novel per year, I usually spend the rest of the year trying to find another novel to satisfy me as much (or close to as much) as Sparks'  books do - - I think I've found this in Ronald Anthony!   <br /> <br />I stumbled upon this book by accident, after reading some reviews here on Amazon.  After seeing more than one compare this to a Sparks novel, I headed down to my local book store, and immediately picked up a copy to see for myself.  I am so glad I did, and can now add Anthony to my list of favorite \\"new\\" authors. <br /> <br />Written with so much emotion, I can't imagine anyone reading this book without feeling something.   <br /> <br />Three stories are actually told - one of the relationship between an aging father and his youngest son, one of the father's long ago love affair with a woman he just never got over and one of the son's current relationship with a wonderful woman.   <br /> <br />Even after marrying another woman and producing four (now grown) children, Mickey never got over the love of his life.  Jesse (Mickey's son), is now in a not-so-serious relationship with the beautiful, mesmorizing Marina.  Jesse & Marina decide to take their relationship slowly and don't have any plans for a \\"future.\\"  Both have been badly hurt by previous relationships, and rather than run the risk of suffering through that pain again, they both decide to take their relationship one day a time, without any expectations from the other about what direction their relationship is headed.  It is this attitude that causes Mickey to share the story of his lost love with Gina - a love story that took place more than 50 years earlier. <br /> <br />All three stories are equally touching and moving, and cannot be read without some type of emotion.  As love evolves among all the main characters (Mickey& Gina, Jesse & Marina, Mickey & Jesse), I found myself thinking about the many \\"loves\\" in my life.  It's very hard not to get emotionally attached to this story as readers of all ages and genders - in all types of relationships - can easily identify with the characters and the choices they make, mistakes that are made, and chances that have been lost.  While this is a \\"love story\\", it's not simply the story between a man and woman that is told.  Fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, boyfriends and girlfriends, mothers and sons, even between two best friends - all of these relationships are covered within this story. <br /> <br />The story flows nicely from chapter to chapter - some chapters are told from the point of view of Mickey, while others are told by Jesse.  It's not confusing, however, and readers can easily follow along.  I also liked how the story was not very predictable - readers are left guessing what happens right up until the very end - I hate it when a story is so predictable, you're just waiting to get to the part that you already KNOW is going to happen!  This isn't the case with this book.  While I'm sure readers will figure out part of the story - you won't know the full story until you've read the very least page.  There's the perfect amount of light humor involved - I loved how Jesse & Mickey endearingly referred to each other as \\"Moron\\" throughout the story!!  Instead of envisioning a cranky old man in his early 80s, readers are left with the image of a spunky, fun-loving, light-hearted Mickey.  Readers can also see how both Mickey & Jesse grow through the book - each opening the their eyes & hearts to thoughts and feelings that neither one ever thought they'd ever experience.  Both father & son learn from each other -  both, from their mistakes & accomplishments - and its fun to see each of them evolve through the story;  i.e., Jesse loves organic food, gormet coffee, \\"turkey burgers\\" - Mickey is set in his ways and just wants a simple cupof coffee and bacon.  By the end of the story, both have tried & done things neither would have imagined at the beginning of the book. <br /> <br />I'm so glad I found this book, and decided to give it a try.  It was truly a emotional read, one that will be difficult to top in the near future - the new Nicholas Sparks book isn't due to be released until Sept, but at least I had THE FOREVER YEAR to occupy at least some of my reading time til then. <br /> <br />I can't wait to read the next novel from Ronald Anthony - I hope all of his books stay with this theme.  If so, he definitely has a dedicated fan in me! <br /> <br />	2005-05-21

Looks like Cecelia Ahern is making a name for herself, and will soon find herself up there with other Best Selling authors like Elizabeth Berg, Luanne Rice, Debbie Macomber and Kristin Hannah.  If you liked P.S. I LOVE YOU, \\"ROSIE\\" won't let you down!    The entire book is told through emails, instant messages, cards and letters.  I've seen other authors attempt this format, but not since Debbie Macomber's BETWEEN FRIENDS have I seen one so well done.  The story is easy to follow and spans the lifetime of best friends Rosie and Alex.    Of course, the ending is predictable, and I completely disagree with the readers who thought they should have gotten together sooner.  I think these readers completely missed the true meaning & message of the book.  This isn't a love story about Rosie & Alex becoming a couple.  This is a story about following your heart in order to make your lifelong wishes & dreams come true, no matter how far out of reach they may seem, or how many mistakes are made along the way.  Besides always loving Alex, Rosie dreams of owning a hotel ever since she was a teenaged girl.  She goes back to school when she's 30 and graduates at the same time her daughter graduates HS! While loving Rosie from afar, we see Alex go to school and become a well respected heart surgeon.  We see how the friendship between Katie & Toby blooms, and follow along as each of them makes their own dreams come true.  Even the supporting charcters follow their hearts in order to make their dreams come true (I could just picture Ruby salsa dancing - now wouldn't that be fun!) Everyone in this story has a dream to follow - from Rosie's parents, her friends, sister, brother, and even her boss (BTW, another hidden message inside of this book - be careful of your nicknames for your school principal - it could come back to haunt you!!    The author does a fine job of creating supporting characters - I absoutely LOVED Rosie's best girlfriend Ruby!! We meet Rosie's family, and just likereal-life families, we watch them grow up and go their separate ways, yet come together when they need each other the most.  I loved how Rosie's daughter's life mirrored her own as we watch the friendship between Katie and Toby progress at nearly the same speed that Rosie and Alex's does.      The only reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because of two areas I thought were weak:  I thought that the whole idea of the \\"Divorced Womens\\" chat room was out of place and could have been skipped.  I found these sections kind of pointless & distracting, and they really seemed out of place with the rest of the story (and what was with the internet wedding & the revealing of the visitor's names??!). Another part I found very unbelievable & out of place, was Rosie's placement after graduation.  Since the rest of the novel felt so \\"true to life\\", this part just seemed a little over the top, and didn't quite fit in.  Otherwise, the letters and messages told the entire story, and were well put together and easy to follow. I really  liked how the story was told.  Since the letters and messages are written by the characters themselves, it's easy to get inside the hearts and heads of each one, and \\"no\\" what each was thinking & feeling.  The story is told with lots of emotion, just as if you were reading a letter from a family member or a friend.    I really liked P.S. I LOVE YOU, but I have to be honest, I loved ROSIE DUNNE more.  I anxiously look forward to future novels from this promising young author.  If ROSIE is any indication, they will only continue to get better!	2005-02-12
US	51661790	RA50B30UZW40W	1400047455	867047226	Before You Know Kindness: A Novel	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Satisfying, altho a little too long!	Having read Buffalo Soldiers a few years ago, I anxiously awaited the release of the newest novel from Chris Bohjalian.  When I first learned of this release (about 6 mos ago!) I added it to my Wish List, and began counting down the days til its release! I was not disappointed.  I find his writing style, and themes of his novels, very true to life, emotional, meaningful and affective.      The book was very slow to start. While the very first page tells readers of the awful event that will forever change the lives of the McCullough family, the story travels backwards and describes the events leading up to that horrific day.  You don't return to the tragedy until about a third of the way through the book.  Once this life altering event takes place, the novel tells the story of how it has changed and affects each of the various family members.  We learn about each character though chapters told from the point of view of each.  Controversial subjects such as animal rights, deer hunting, recreational drug use & drinking among teens, vegetarians/vegans, and dysfunctional families are all covered in this amazing & interesting read.  The descriptions are excellent, and Bohjalian writes emotion very well.  We learn what drives & motivates each character, and how they feel about those who oppose their views.  The family finds itself at the center of a controversy, and the novel shows how each of the characters handles themselves and deals with these issues.  Readers of this novel are certain to find themselves pondering these issues, and should take the time to stop and consider how they would handle themselves should they ever find themself in a similar situation.    I really enjoy Bohjalian's writing style and the way he captures emotions and digs into the inner drama of a family.  The McCullough family could be any of the families in your neighborhood.  The characters feel real, and readers should easily identify with any of one of them.  Who doesn't know a teen like Charlotte, or a \\"matriarch\\" like Nan?  And almost every large family has a member like Spencer - who believes that his way of life is the best for everyone.  I just found it a little too long and drawn out, however, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  While I kept wanting to read to find out what happens next, and when the members of the McCullough family discovered their consciences and finally did the \\"right thing\\", it just took a little too long to get there, and I found myself thinking \\"C'mon already - when is this stubborness going to end!\\"      It's still a wonderful read, and an insightful look at the makings of a family.  It's nice to read a book that's so easy to identify with, and captures the true meaning of \\"family spirit.\\"	2005-02-07
US	51661790	R33DBT3QNN5JDI	0060509414	292132527	Baker Towers	Books	5	53	55	N	N	WOW!! Best new book of 2005!	I picked up this book after reading several excellent reviews in various publications.  Now that I've finished reading it, I'm going to add my own \\"excellent review\\" to the list! <br /> <br />This novel is so well written, there is something for everyone inside.  The book follows the lives of a single family living in a small town in Pennsylvania from the 1940's through the 60's.  Each chapter singles out one member of the family, telling the story from that character's perspective.  We see how each family member grows and matures, and how the ever changing world around them effects each one, and the direction that their life takes.   <br /> <br />There's the oldest son, Georgie who goes off to war & then rushes into an unhappy marriage, Dorothy who moves to Washington to escape the \\"traditional\\" job of a woman in the dress factory of Bakerton,  Joyce who becomes the \\"parent\\" to the rest of the family, including her own mother, Sandy the rebellious son, who follows his own path without ever looking back, and the \\"baby\\" of the family Lucy, who observes the older members of her family and decides early on which paths in life she definitely does not want to take. <br /> <br />The author has done a wonderful job keeping the readers guessing, and turning the pages to find out what happens next.  Nothing is predictable, and there are many \\"surprises\\" along the way.  I've read some reviews here, where readers have criticized the \\"jump\\" from time to time - I didn't find this distracting at all, and actually thought it kept the story moving along at an excellent pace.  The story's not dragged out, and time isn't wasted on insignificant events.  My only \\"complaint\\" (if you even want to call it that) is that there are times in the story where a character will refer to a future event that hasn't happened yet, and as the chapter progresses, the story actually moves backwards, as if the character is reminiscing.  The times that this happens, however, are done very subtly - sometimes the reader may not even realize that a future event has been given away! <br /> <br />There are also many nostalgic references made throughout the book - everything from radio shows to early TV to the kinds of cars the characters drive and the clothing they wear.  I'm sure many will find the story a \\"step back in time\\" which is certain to bring back many happy (or not so happy) memories!   <br /> <br />While it's still early in the year, I'd have to say that BAKER TOWERS is probably one of the best books of 2005!  If you haven't read it yet, please pick it up, and if you have already finished it, I urge you to recommend it to all of your friends.  I haven't been as excited about a book since I read the LOVELY BONES back in 2002!  With the right kind of \\"word of mouth\\" publicity, I can easily see this one becoming just as popular!   <br />	2005-02-06
US	51661790	R3I0SD2JOZNFP3	0553804111	624010824	Silver Bells	Books	2	13	15	N	N	Disappointing - But Luanne Rice is still one of my favorites	Let me start by saying that I am a fan and faithful reader of Luanne Rice.  I've been buying & reading her books since the release of CLOUD NINE several years ago, and she is still one of the best (and most beloved) authors of women's fiction today!  Most of her books follow the same theme - Boy meets girl, girl falls in love w/boy, an obstacle threatens to keep them apart, true love perseveres and the lovers find their way to each other, and all live \\"happily ever after!\\"  While the theme of each novel may be the same in each book, what makes each one an interesting read & keeps readers coming back are the character development and story settings, which are so well done, the reader finds themselves emotionally attached.  Although I've loved some of her books more than others, they've all been the kinds of  books that I can't wait to see what the next chapter brings, and leave me wanting more at the end.  Sadly, I can't say the same was true of SILVER BELLS.    With the success of the holiday novels from Best Selling authors like Debbie Macomber, John Grisham, and Nora Roberts, perhaps Ms. Rice felt it was time to \\"jump on the band wagon\\" and write her own tale of love at the holidays.  Unfortunately, it fell flat, and my advice would be to stick to the traditional stories like BEACH GIRLS, CLOUD NINE and FOLLOW THE STARS HOME.    There was no character development, and no one to truly root for.  As a reader, I didn't find myself emotionally drawn to any of the characters in this story, and didn't really care one way or another if the characters ended up together or went their separate ways.  From the small amount of background on each character that was provided, it was hard to believe some of the choices that they made and the ending just seemed to be a little unbelievable.  The whole story just seemed to be a little bit forced, and there was way too much drama for such a short holiday story.  This particular story may have been better told as a full length HC novel, instead of an abbreviated holiday tale.    While I usually find myself anxiously turning the pages of a Luanne Rice novel, the reason for this is because the story holds so much of my interest that I can't wait to see what happens next.  More often than not, I'm disappointed when I'm done - not because the story was a disappointment, but because the author's left me wanting more!  This time around I found myself anxiously turning the pages for an entirely different reason - I actually couldn't wait to finish the book and see it end already.  And this time my disappointment when I was done had nothing to do with my wanting more - I was just glad to be done with it already, and to finally have it end.    I usually start my New Year off each year by reading the newest novel from Ms. Rice.  This year, however, I have to wait until June for her newest book, which I guess was caused by the time it spent her to write SILVER BELLS so that it was ready for release in time for the holidays.  I'm looking forward to returning to a more \\"traditional\\" Luanne Rice novel.  I can only hope that this was the first and last holiday read from Ms. Rice, and that next year I can return to starting my new year off with the latest HC novel from one of my favorite authors!     If SILVER BELLS was the first Luanne Rice book that any of you have read, I encourage you to go back and read any of one of her previous novels to get the full scope of this author's talent (BEACH GIRLS, CLOUD NINE or SUMMER FIRES would be a few good choices!) Or wait until June and pick up a copy of the HC SUMMER ROSES or the PB SUMMER'S CHILD, both of which I am anxiously looking forward to!	2005-02-06
US	51661790	R3QP606EM3LOXC	0316781487	223736820	Light on Snow	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Not much depth to this one - Disappointed	I have not read all of Anita Shreve's previous novels, but I have read a few and I know that she is one of the most respected, and much sought after novelists of today.  She writes stories for women, which women can identify with, and her novels are usually full of strong characters who can carry the story from chapter to chapter.    I was really looking forward to LIGHT ON SNOW,  as the idea seemed to hold so much promise.  But once I was done, I found myself extremely disappointed.      I didn't find any of the characters remotely appealing, and none of them seemed very strong.  The story is told from a child's point of view, as the narrator, now in her 30s, recalls the events that took place and tells the story how she saw it as a pre-teen girl.  This seemed rather pointless, as the story never returned to the present day in which the narrator is telling the story.  I kept waiting to see what affect the whole experience had on the life of this woman who is telling this story, but it never happened.   It never showed how this life-altering event shaped her life, and how it may have changed which paths she took and followed.  What affect, if any, did this single winter have on this woman? And what about her father? and the young mother?  How did this single winter change their lives?? These are the things I wanted to know, and never had answered.   What was the point of a 30 yr old recalling the winter of her 12th year, unless that specific winter and/or event had some affect on this woman today?    It's a fast read - very simple to get through, but the characters are lacking, maybe even a little it weak, and even the pace seemed a little bit \\"off.\\"  I don't know if Ms. Shreve is hard at work at her next novel, and perhaps this is why she couldn't give this one the time and attention it so needed.  It almost seems as if she hurried up and rushed through this book, just because it was \\"that time of year\\" and she had nothing else to publish.    Whatever the reason, Ifound the book a \\"comfortable\\" read, without many emotions.  I certainly didn't find myself looking for more once the book ended,  and couldn't tell you if I even remotely liked any of the characters.  Still, its a \\"light\\" read with a satsifying ending - just not the one I was expecting or hoping for.    Unfortunately, this is not Ms. Shreve's best work, and I only hope the reason for this is that she is hard at work on her next novel, and just couldn't give this one the time that it needed.  It really had a lot of potential, and it seemed to start out strong, but it slowly started dropping off, and had a hard time deciding where it was going.  I	2004-11-04

When I wasn't reading this novel, I was looking forward to picking it up again, and seeing what happens next to Charlotte/Blossom.  This is a sign of an excellent writer, in my opinion - when a reader can't wait to see what happens next, as it means that the author has the reader's full attention, and the story is moving along at a steady pace.  <br /> <br />I was looking forward to the end of the story and seeing how the author was going to conclude Charlotte's \\"adventure.\\"  I wondered how high of a price her year of growth and \\"freedom\\" were going to cost her, and what, if any, consequences she would face.  The author had me all the way until the last 3-4 chapters, when, unfortunately, the story seemed to loose some of its momentum, when it should have come to a more satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br />I won't give away the ending in any way, but I felt that the last few chapters were a little too \\"rushed\\" and once Charlotte's future was determined, the story seemed to wrap up just a little too \\"perfectly\\" with no surprises or suspense.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with how Charlotte's story went full circle and for what the future has in store for the book's heroine.  The ending just seemed a little too \\"sugar coated\\" compared to the rest of the story and what led Charlotte back to this place in the journey of life.  After all of the paths that Charlotte had taken, it seemed that her ending was just a little too perfect and \\"nice.\\" <br /> <br />I wouldn't exactly call this book \\"chick lit\\" but it is definitely \\"women's fiction.\\"  I'd compare it more to the novels of Debbie Macomber, Kristin Hannah or Jill Marie Landis.  If you enjoy the stories that these authors write, you should thoroughly enjoy this heart warming story of friendship, love and survival from first-time novelist Robin Schwarz.   <br /> <br />I do look forward to future books written by this promising new writer.  Overall, I thought the story was great and was very well written.  It had everything needed to capture the reader's attention, keeping them turning the pages to find out what happens next.  The ending just seemed a little too \\"perfect\\" and I would have liked to have seen it played out just a little bit more once Charlotte returned from her adventure.   <br /> <br />The characters were well developed and thoroughly believable.  There aren't too many \\"over-the-top\\" moments and it's easy to fall in love with Charlotte/Blossom and cheer for her along the way.  You'll smile at her ups, and may even cry at her \\"downs\\", but I'm sure that most readers will find themselves cheering along with the friends of her past and her present, and will be routing for Charlotte all the way to the end. <br /> <br />I read this book after an ad in \\"People\\" mag grabbed my attention.  It would be nice to see this book given a little more exposure, as I think it holds a lot of promise.  It would even make for an entertaining movie, I think surpassing even \\"Bridgette Jones\\" as I think the characters of this novel are much more believable, and could be easily brought to life on the \\"big screen.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, a fun, entertaining and very fast read from an author who shows plenty of promise.   <br />	2004-10-13
US	51661790	R2S86S5ULIDK57	0743470095	218862275	Little Earthquakes	Books	5	6	8	N	N	This has got to be Weiner's BEST Book yet!	I'll be honest - I never read the first two novels that Jennifer Weiner wrote.  They seemed to much like \\"Bridgette Jones\\", and I found that very disappointing.  LITTLE EARTHQUAKES takes a completely different road than her first two books. <br /> <br />This is a book which ALL mothers - new, old, and sooon-to-be - can identify with.  I can easily see a little of myself in each of the four main characters.   <br /> <br />But this book is not just about the mothers and their experiences that a newborn brings - It's a story of friendship and romance.  Two of my favorite reading subjects!! <br /> <br />Each chapter is told from the point of view of one of the four main characters (a writing style I really enjoy), and is divided into twelve parts - one for each month of a single year.  The story flows from one charcter's narrative to the next, which always leaves the reader wanting to know what's going to happen next.   <br /> <br />Among the characters, you've got \\"Kelly\\", the bubbly, young mother who is an over-achiever; \\"Becky\\" the free-spirited, risk taker who just \\"goes with the flow\\"; \\"Aiyinde\\" the sophisticated wife of a basketball superstar, who always seems to find herself hidden among the shadows of others; and \\"Lia\\" (\\"Lisa\\") the once famous Hollywood actress who recently lost her son and finds herself back home again feeling as if she has nothing left to offer those who love her most. <br /> <br />Readers will experience the highs and lows of each character, beginning with the days and months just before their babies are born, witnessing the joys and sorrows that come along with new motherhood, and the various ways that women handle life's common turn of events. <br /> <br />At one time or another, I found myself remembering a time & place in which I felt the same way that one of the four main characters were feeling and their experiences as they try to juggle new motherhood, returning to the work force, finding time for romance, dealing with an interferringgrandparent, and basically trying not to feel too overwhelmed by it all.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the book and found myself disappointed as the chapters were winding down.  I wanted more, and still hope to learn what comes next for each of the four main charatcers as they learn life's hardest lessons, managing each day as it comes, figuring out how to juggle new motherhood while trying to never loose sight of themselves and who they were before this bundle of joy took over their lives. <br /> <br />This is definitely a book I recommend to ALL mothers, young and old, from a newborn baby to the recently married child.  As new moms read along, they will see that they are not alone and all the emotions that they are feeling right now are just part of the \\"ride\\", and mothers of grown-up children will flashback to a time in which they thought they'd never get through another day!  Thank you Ms. Weiner for putting into words what so many mothers have such a hard time expressing	2004-09-30

I never knew that Kristin Gore was a writer for SNL & Futurama, and has even won an Emmy for her work!  I have to say, I really enjoyed this book and look forward to many more from this promising new novelist! <br /> <br />I had just finished reading THE SECOND ASSISTANT, and was hoping for another light-hearted, fun read when I heard about the release of this book, and found it at my local bookstore on the day of its release. Once I started reading, I found it hard to put down! <br /> <br />The characters are well developed, and the pacing of the story is perfect.  There aren't many unbelievable, or way over the top moments, as you occasionally find in some \\"chic-lit\\" books, and I'm not even sure that I would classify this book as a true \\"chic-lit\\" read. <br /> <br />You don't have to know much about politics, and for those who think that this is just another way to force someone else's opinions, you'd be wrong.  Although the political issue at hand is of interest to me (health care for seniors), it isn't the book's main subject matter, and only serves as backdrop for most of the story.  You may even learn a few things about the subject while this is NOT the purpose of the book. <br /> <br />I have to admit that the opening of the book was a little slow to get going, and when I first read an excerpt in the Aug issue of Glamour mag, I wasn't sure I was really going to like it. By the second, third chapters, however, Ms. Gore finds her pacing and the story picks up from there.  The character development is excellent, and you can see how and why Sammy feels the way she does about her co-workers, friends and acquaintances.   You'll find yourself routing for Sammy, and even for her boss, and probably even develop a sore spot for their opponent, and those who break her heart.  <br /> <br />I only had two problems with the book.  One, was that about halfway through it, a life-changing event takes place in Sammy's \\"social life\\" (I don't want to give it away because it accounts for about 75% of the story!), and you're kind of left thinking, \\"How will she finish the book, and fill up the next 150 pages?  Ms. Gore manages to do this however, and once Sammy gets \\"over the hill\\" the story picks up its pace again, and the novel is back on track. <br /> <br />The second is something I don't really don't want to give away (for those who haven't read it yet, it will ruin it) - but as for a hint:  When the \\"Special Agents\\" visit Sammy at her home, and spill the beans about the owner of the Pet Shop - I thought that this part was just a little over the top, unbelievable and really not  necessary.  I didn't think that it fit with the tone in the rest of the book. <br /> <br />The ending of the book is very satisfying, and appears to have been left open for a sequel.  I for one, hope that this is true, as I would like to see what happens next, and how Sammy takes her hopes and dreams even farther.  Considering that this is the \\"premier novel\\" from Ms. Gore, I can only imagine that her books will continue to get better with each release, and that would be wonderful, as I honestly couldn't find much to improve upon inside the pages of SAMMY'S HILL.  I, for one, would certainly be one of the first in line to purchase future novels from Kristin Gore!  Congratulations on a job well done!! (Your dad must be so proud!) <br />	2004-09-28
US	51661790	R1EPLONFQDP6D9	0553587242	499659282	Beach Girls	Books	5	7	8	N	N	This summer's PB is Hardcover material!	Every summer, Luanne Rice releases a PB book which usually has some connection to the previous summer's release.  BEACH GIRLS is no exception, with references to Bay & Tara who first appeared in last year's PERFECT SUMMER (2003), and even a small reference to Mrs. Renwick, who first appeared in FIREFLY BEACH, then later in PERFECT SUMMER.  The PB novels, which are released every summer, don't usually excite me as much or grab my attention the way that Luanne Rice's HC releases do each Jan/Feb.  (I have to admit - I never even finished reading FIREFLY BEACH because I just couldn't get into it!).  BEACH GIRLS was another story, however.  This story seemed to follow the same pattern that Luanne Rice's HC books seem to go, with a heavier, emotionally charged story with several characters intertwined and connected by the heart.  I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />I have been reading Luanne Rice since a friend loaned me their copy of CLOUD NINE shortly after its original release.  I have been hooked ever since, and have become quite the fan.  The PB books which she releases in the summer always seem to be a fast paced, light-hearted read, meant to be read quickly, and then seem to be soon-forgotten.  They aren't as emotionally charged as her HC books are, but BEACH GIRLS was different. <br /> <br />I don't think I would compare this book to the Ya-Ya books (as some have done here), although it does refer to the bonds between Best Friends.  I do find similarities to Judy Blume's SUMMER SISTERS,  Debbie Macomber's SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET and BETWEEN FRIENDS, and Kristin Hannah's THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE. These are some of my favorite authors/books, and now BEACH GIRLS is right up there, earning a high rating and recommendation from me. <br /> <br />Anyone who enjoys a story about true friendship, and the love and bonds between family & friends, will thoroughly enjoy this book.  It's all there - the three best friends who grew up spending summers together on the beach; a close brother/sister relationship which is put to the test when one of the siblings feels betrayed by the other; the tender and innocent child who brings them all together.  It's all there for readers to enjoy, without being overly melodramatic. <br /> <br />Of course it's predictable.  Luanne Rice has been writing women's fiction for more than 10 years now, and all of her stories carry the same themes and are meant to pull at the reader's heartstrings.  With all the connections to previous novels, what does one expect?  I don't think that Luanne Rice's summer PBs are the best novels to draw in new fans and attract readers - I think the HC books are much better at grabbing readers' attention and stopping their hearts.  But BEACH GIRLS was different, and I think that someone who has never read a Luanne Rice novel before, would be easily enticed into picking up another one of her previous books - perhaps even reading PERFECT SUMMER, in order to get the background on Bay & Tara!!  But if a new reader isn't interested in going backwards to the novels of the past, I think anyone who read BEACH GIRLS and Luanne Rice for the first time would make sure they pick up a copy of her next HC novel, which should be on bookstore shelves shortly after the New Year!!  I know I'm looking forward to it, and can't wait to see what's in store!  I'm also hoping that maybe next summer's PB novel will pick up where this one left off, because once you finish this book, you'll definitely be wanting to know what happened next! <br />	2004-09-27
US	51661790	R29GHJQ1QH08PQ	0670033073	683116309	The Second Assistant: A Tale from the Bottom of the Hollywood Ladder	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Fun, Light Reading1	I picked up a copy of this book after reading several reviews comparing it to the NANNY DIARIES and DEVIL WEARS PRADA.  I enjoyed those two books, and love the Hollywood \\"scene\\", so I thought, Why not?    I was impressed with the book and the fact that this is a first time novel.  Reminiscent of the NANNY DIARIES (which was also written by a pair of friends), the book is light and fun without being flaky and meaningless.    As in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, the book's main character, Elizabeth (\\"Lizzie\\"), is excited at first, but then finds herself overworked and frazzled almost on a daily basis when she accepts a job as a Second Assistant for a thoughtless, self-involved and sometimes arrogant Hollywood agent.  Coming off a promising career in politics, Elizabeth is horrified early on to find herself doing things and winding up in positions (literally!) that she never imagined she'd find herself in.  She finds herself attracted to the \\"wrong man\\" early on, and that attraction is played out throughout the book.      The book is light and fun, and you'll find yourself rooting for Elizabeth as she learns the ropes and finally decides what it is that she really wants to do with her life and career.  Some of the situations Elizabeth finds herself in along the way are a little over-the-top and somewhat unbelievable (a scummy date who likes to video tape his \\"girls\\" singing karaoke??), but it's fun to play along and try to figure out which parts of the book ring true in the world of Hollywood and which parts come from the authors' imaginations.      The flow of the book moves along nicely and readers aren't rushed into any of the scenes.  They're also not forced into liking (or disliking) any of the characters and can decide for themselves which ones they want to root for - and there are many in addition to Lizzie that the reader can choose from - and who they wish would be written out!  My only problem with the book was its ending.  Although the story appears to have been wrapped up nicely and comes to a satisfying, \\"happily ever after\\" conclusion, I found there to be a few loose ends, which I would have liked to have seen wrapped up as well as more than a few unanswered questions.  I'm hoping this was done purposely, perhaps, with a sequel or follow-up not far behind.  The way that the story ends certainly leaves room for so much more. (*Reviewer's note: This review has since been edited w/the sequel due out any day)    If you're looking for some light, fun reading to wrap up the summer, I recommend you pick up a copy of the SECOND ASSISTANT - a refreshing, humorous, and occasionally touching story of the goings-on behind the scenes of Hollywood.  I can't wait to see what happens next - I just hope I don't have to wait too long to find out!	2004-08-10

I have to admit, I am not really a true fan of James Patterson, altho I did read SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am not a fan of mysteries/crime novels, so I have therefore, never even read another one of Patterson's novels (altho I have seen a few of the movies based on his novels). My favorite author is Nicholas Sparks, followed very closely by Debbie Macomber and Luanne Rice. I usually like to read women's fiction and/or love stories (not romance). After I read SUZANNE'S DIARY, I sincerely hoped that Patterson would put aside the crime novels and write another story along the same subject. I was thrilled when I heard that SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER was being released and I couldn't wait for the day it went on sale. I made sure I got to the bookstore that day, and was one of the first to purchase it.  <br />  <br /> Once I began reading it, I got a little excited seeing that the story opened in Chicago, being from the suburbs of Chicago myself and working in the city for several years. After the third chapter, however, the rest of the story takes place in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and I slowly began loosing interest. <br />  <br /> The story follows the same kind of idea that SUZANNE'S DIARY did, and I was hopeful, but it never seemed to get going. It was very predictable, and even though I appreciate short chapters (making it easy to read in between work breaks, and on the train), it seemed almost TOO simple, and reminded me of the beginner books given to grade school children! Even the language and the plotline seemed a little too simple. <br />  <br /> It could have been a beautiful, wonderful story, but it just seemed like the author kept holding back and never displayed any real emotion. The storyline was predictable, and the characters weren't even fully likable. I embraced Suzanne and Nicholas - but I never felt connected to Jennifer or Sam, and the only character I remotely liked (or cared for) was Brendon. <br />  <br /> Without giving away too much of the storyline, it all seemed a little \\"fairytale\\" like. Everything seemed to wrap up nicely, and the characters all lived \\"happily ever after.\\" The \\"dilemmas\\" the characters faced seemed forced, and there was never any question whether or not it will all work out in the end.  <br />  <br /> I hope that SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS wasn't a one-time thing that Patterson won't ever be able to duplicate. His mysteries and crime novels are huge best sellers, and he has a loyal fan base that never seems to be disappointed. SAM'S LETTERS FOR JENNIFER could have been just as good, if not better, than SUZANNE'S DIARY, but it almost seemed like Patterson rushed through the writing, and never allowed himself to be fully invested in his characters. They weren't fully developed, and therefore, I as a reader, couldn't connect with them.  <br />  <br /> If you are a fan of Patterson's crime novels and don't usually like a good love story and/or piece of women's fiction, I recommend you skip this one, as you will most likely be disappointed and feel as if you wasted your time. If you read SUZANNE'S DIARY, and were looking forward to this novel as much as I was, I recommend you check it out of the library or borrow a copy and save your money for the next novel by Nicholas Sparks, Debbie Macomber and/or Luanne Rice. It just isn't up to par, and is nowhere as good as anything written by the aforementioned authors.  <br />  <br /> I do hope Patterson gives it another try, however, and writes another novel along the same subject line - but if he does, I recommend he take the time to fully develop his characters, and give readers something to attach themselves to - SAM'S LETTERS FOR JENNIFER just felt empty to me, and I honestly didn't care about them once I reached the end (whereas, I'm usually wishing for another hundred pages, or looking for a sequel!!!) <br />  <br />	2004-07-28

I have read each and every one of his novels (and his recent memoir) since the original release of THE NOTEBOOK almost ten years ago. <br />THE NOTEBOOK is Nicholas Sparks' first, and by far, the BEST of all the novels he has written. This is the book which started it all, earning Nicholas Sparks a place on Best Seller lists everywhere. When it was originally released, the HC spent more than ONE YEAR (actually, almost TWO YEARS!) on the Best Sellers list.  By now, it is probably close to (or maybe even surpassed) its 50th printing! <br />This novel is such a fan favorite, and &quot;Noah and Allie&quot; are so beloved, that Sparks was inspired to write a 'sequel' (THE WEDDING) to it just last year (the only 'sequel' he's ever written!). In fact, according to a recent poll on Sparks' website, the character of 'Noah' is by far the most popular of all the characters Sparks has created, earning more than TWICE the number of votes that the second place character earned!!<br />The recent release of the movie has spawned a new 'generation' of readers and should (rightfully so) earn Mr. Sparks many new fans. I hope that those who have recently read THE NOTEBOOK for the very first time will continue with Noah &amp; Allie's story, by following it up with THE WEDDING, and then at least one other of the many Best Selling novels Sparks has written. (To fully appreciate the wonderful 'gift' of Nicholas Sparks and THE NOTEBOOK, I encourage readers to read his recent Best Selling memoir, THREE WEEKS WITH MY BROTHER, where readers can learn how these characters were brought to life, and what has inspired Sparks to be the author he is today!). <br />What I love about a Nicholas Sparks novel is that most readers can identify with at least one of the many characters he has created over the years. Whether it be the lovable, sentimental 'Noah'; the sweet, innocent 'Jamie' (WALK TO REMEMBER); the strong, hero 'Taylor' (THE RESCUE); the life-saving protector 'Mike' (THE GUARDIAN); the cautious loner who rediscovers love 'Garret' (MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE); the hard-working, determined, loving mother 'Denise' (THE RESCUE); the smart-alleck young man who learns how to love 'Landon' (WALK TO REMEMBER); or any one of the many others, Nicholas Sparks creates characters which we can all find within ourselves. Readers can identify with these characters in every way - from their strong will, vulnerable hearts and determined spirit.  <br />Altho classified as a &quot;love story&quot;, THE NOTEBOOK and other Sparks' novels, are not just love stories between a man and a woman - within the pages of a Nicholas Sparks novel, readers will find the love stories of mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, friends, and neighbors.  They are the inspired &quot;love stories&quot; of all of us, and are especially needed in the world we live in today. <br />THE NOTEBOOK is a truly inspired story, and Nicholas Sparks is a gifted writer, deserving every bit of the attention &amp; praise this new movie has generated. By climbing the Best Sellers list again - nearly ten years after its original release - and capturing the hearts of a new generation of readers, THE NOTEBOOK has proven itself to be a classic, timeless love story for all ages, and Nicholas Sparks as an author to be cherished, appreciated, and read for many years to come.  <br />(If you've read THE NOTEBOOK and enjoyed it, be sure to follow it up with THE WEDDING - Noah &amp; Allie aren't &quot;complete&quot; until readers have gone full circle!)	2004-07-01

To begin with, I have to say that Nicholas Sparks is my absolute favorite author.  I am usually one of the first in line to purchase his books on the day of their release.  I go home and &quot;gobble&quot; it up as fast as I can, then am disappointed for the other 364 days of the year until his next novel is released.  I've always wished he would release more than one novel in a one year period, and was thrilled when he began releasing twice a year.  Sadly, this is the last year for that, and next year I will go on yearning for a Nicholas Sparks book for a little more than 11 months of the year!<br />That said, after reading his memoir, I can now understand why he only publishes only once a year, and appreciate his work that much more.  His family comes first, and although he loves to write and is honored by his readers' attention &amp; devotion, he simply does not want to spend any less time with his family than he absolutely must.  In order to fulfill this need, we as readers must savor the books we are given, and anxiously await his next delicious read.<br />I was deeply touched by the relationship Nicholas has with his brother.  Being the only surviving members of the Sparks family, they have a deep bond, and their admiration and love for one another is obvious in the words on the pages, and even in the smallest of photos in the book.  It most certainly deserves the attention this book calls to it, and I can only imagine that some of the readers whose views are printed here must be envious of this bond, lacking the love &amp; support of their families, which the Sparks brothers so deeply cherish.<br />If you know anything about Nicholas Sparks and read the book's jacket, you must certainly know that this is NOT a travel book!  The trip around the world only serves as a setting for the brothers to reminisce and share the stories of their childhood and the roads they led, and how the effects of these events shaped their lives &amp; made them into the successful, respected men they have grown to be.  The trip around the world was a celebration of sorts, for these two brothers who have shared the most painful experiences two brothers can share, yet carried on and persevered.  The book was not written to describe the places they saw and encourage others to visit these places.  The trip served as inspiration for Nicholas to share HIS STORY, demonstrating to others that you can survive life's most painful experiences with the love &amp; support of family.<br />If you knew anything about this book beforehand, you also know that the book was written entirely by Nicholas, and Micah was included because of his inspiration, and how Nicholas' admiration for his brother led him to share their story!!  Although Nicholas did all the writing, this story is as much Micah's as it is Nicholas', and both brothers are deserving of its credit.<br />Although the book is a memoir, Mr. Sparks remains true to his craft, and at times, you may think you are reading his next novel, and forget that these events actually happened to one family.  It is because of these events, we as readers have been treated to wonderful, endearing stories of love, courage, strength and the bonds of family.  We can truly appreciate the love &amp; connection of Noah &amp; Allie, understand why Jamie was so forgiving, strong &amp; courageous, and see just how difficult is must have been for Denise to bring words to the lips of Kyle.  The characters of Sparks' novels have been mostly inspired by members of his family, and it because of the tragic events of his life, we as readers have been treated, and come to love novels like THE NOTEBOOK, MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, A WALK TO REMEMBER, THE RESCUE and THE WEDDING.<br />I anxiously await the release of Sparks' newest novel this fall, and while I'm still disappointed that I will again have to wait an entire year for his next book, I can now understand why I have to wait, and it only makes me more appreciative of his work, and treasure all of his stories that much more.<br />Thank you Nicholas - for opening your heart, inviting us in, and sharing your life.  You will always be my favorite, and your memoir has only made me cherish your writing that much more!	2004-05-27

If you don't take it seriously, it's a fund read and if you enjoy fashion (like me) you will the best part will be the never-ending references to Chanel, Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanik - If employees of the magazines get all the perks described here - then I'm in the wrong field of work!!!  Please, someone, point me in the right direction for a career at one of the top fashion mags!!! I would have liked to know a little more about Miranda - Why does she behave the way she does?  What are her children like and how and when did she meet her current husband and just what is it about Miranda that makes \\"B-Dad\\" stick around?  Perhaps an event to make her a little more human would have done it - but there's nothing in this book that will make any reader even remotely like her (and if you do, how sad!!) I'd also like to know more about Andrea - besides the promise of a great reference for a job at the New Yorker (why she thinks time spent in a FASHION magazine will impress the editors at THE NEW YORKER is still beyond me!!!) Halfway through the book, most readers will get the jest that most other NY editors despise Miranda - so why Andrea would think a referral from her to the NEW YORKER would be impressive doesn't make much sense - I've read some of the reviews where the readers felt that Andrea was almost as shallow and spoiled as Miranda but I don't think that's the case - I think she's a confused young woman who knows what she ultimately wants to do, but has no idea how to achieve it - She's anxious and eager which is why she takes this job in the first place - She believes one year of service for Miranda is worth more than 4 years of college and a degree and lesser experience will ever be!!!  I mean don't forget, we are talking about a 23 year old New Yorker - The fact that she spends company money on coffee for the homeless says something - and I think her flirtation with Christian is harmless fun and exploration on her part (let's not forget, she's been with her boyfriend all through HS - she has no idea what else is out there - When was the last time, you turned down some harmless flirting???) - The ultimate catchall though is when Miranda tells Andrea that she reminds her of herself when she was that age - That's the ultimate spooker - Andrea is never the same after that line - and that's when all hell breaks loose - Overall, a fun, fast read - easy comparisons to the NANNY DIARIES can be made (Nasty mother/Nasty editor)(Nave Nanny/Clueless Assistant) (Sinful, Cheating  Father's Mistress/Faithful, Supportive Sr. Asst to Miranda)(Loving Supportive Family/Loving, Supportive Family)(Devilishly Handsome Young Neighbor/Devilishly Handsome Young Writer)  -Should be a light, fun read - Not to be taken too seriously!	2003-05-20

I like how the story is told alternately between Jackie and Ford - that's always a good thing in my opinion - gives the reader the opportunity to view the story from two different viewpoints without having to re-read the book to look at it from another angle - I like to see how the opinions of the same events are so different between the two main characters - Most of the other characters were likable (even Ford's cousin grew on you!!) - and there was enough suspense to hold your interest and keep you turning the pages (but not too much to change the subject to mystery or suspense) - although I had pretty much figured it out early on (I'm sure most readers will too) - it didn't make me want to skim the pages or skip anything - I just wanted to know how they ended up where they were - the one thing I disliked about this book is the use of the devil - I don't usually care for occult fiction and I think there may have been a different way that this same story could have been told - although the devil story is one of the major plot points, it does not take over and monopolize the entire book - that's why I was able to [put up with it and] \\"grin and bear it!\\"  I have to say, I enjoyed this story much more than Ms. Deveraux's last HC release (The Mulberry Tree, which seemed to go on and on & left me disappointed in the end) - while there are many characters and names to remember and it can at times be a little confusing - each character has a purpose and no one was written unnecessarily - the book flowed nicely and because there are \\"sub-plots\\" going on all the time, it was easy to overlook the devil aspect of the story and just enjoy some good ole fashioned story-telling!  A few things caused \\"alarm bells\\" ring - for example, how quickly Jackie agreed to work with Ford and move to another state!! (in this day and age, would you move away to another state, to a town where you knew no one and agree to live with a person you just met only days ago??!!) - Overall, I liked the book and thought it was a good read - I'd recommend it to friends - I think most readers will identify with at least one or two of the characters of the story - and the main characters are really, genuinely likable (one can see right through the rough and tough exterior Ford tries to give off in the beginning - you just know he's a big, lovable \\"teddy bear!\\"  It's a fun story and has everything you need to be a good 'beach read\\" this summer - love, friendship, mystery, romance, suspense, etc. - If you're a fan of Deveraux, you will definitely want to read this book  - I don't know how it compares to her earlier novels, but compared to some of the novels published recently, this is an enjoyable read - and if you like women's fiction , then you won't want to pass this one up - thanks for an entertaining, \\"different\\" story!  If it werent for the devil  Id give it 5 stars!!	2003-04-29

I absolutely loved this book and I applaud the author for tackling such a sensitive subject - she did it such a tasteful, satisfying way - The use of Sept 11th as a plot line for this book is in no way done is poor taste or as a gimmick.  I found myself comparing this book to The Lovely Bones - perhaps it is because it is also told from the point of view of a 13 year old (or maybe the color of the book?!?!) But seriously, I really enjoyed reading this book - It is a heartfealt, touching story told in flowing, descriptive sentences  - One could say the point of this story is that no one family is perfect and there is no one way to define a family - Wendy has two families - one on each coast - and neither one is better for her than the other - she is loved and respected equally by both - but in two entirely different ways - Teenage pregnancy is dealt with in an informative, educational way without being lectured on the subject - Autism, divorce, homelessness, and puberty are also brought into play - all in good taste and with good reason - don't worry about there being too many plot lines - everything happens for a reason in this story and it all blends together well - - But the heart of this story if family - true and true - There is no one who will love you more or who you can count on and turn to in time of crisis that is better prepared to handle it than your family - I recommend this book to all - Don't be afraid because of the reference to Sept. 11th - it is not the main point and it is not beaten into the reader's mind - the events are explained tastefully and a mature reader can easily see that it's about time to use the events of that horrific day to tell the story of families, heartache, loss  - but most of all LOVE - Thank you Joyce Maynard - I hope you receive the recognition you so deserve for this book - C'mon everyone, spread the word about this book - Let's make this story, this year's Lovely Bones!!!	2003-03-01

The attraction seemed to come from no where) - but it was an overall pretty pleasant read - a little predictable at times (Daisy) but for the most part charming (how cute was Petey and his crush on the girls!) It's the first book I've read by McDermott and I'd like to check out her other titles - something about it reminded me of Lovely Bones - perhaps it was the point of view it was told from - I would recommend it to anyone who wants a light read that is cute, charming and overall up-lifting.  Perhaps a sequel down the road after Theresa goes to college would be an idea - to see how her perspective on life and love have changed and how the events of this summer affected her future and life's decisions.	2003-01-18

This was by far the worst book I have read in a long time - I own Joy Fielding's two previous novels but have honestly not had the chance to read them yet - I don't know if I will now.  I thought she wrote about women's issues - friendship, love, family, etc.  I knew that this book was supposed to have some mystique to it - a little bit of suspense, but - OH MY GOSH!! - Halfway through the book, the main character goes pyscho!  I couldn't believe what I was reading.  Murder, lies, deceit, more murder, more lies, etc.  I do not like these kinds of books and found what I was reading very disturbing.  About halfway through the book, I began to figure out what was happening and \\"skimmed\\" the rest of it - I still got what happened and the ending absolutely stinks!! (maybe she's builing the next plot for a Sue Grafton novel, who knows!) Anyhow, if you like books about murder, mystery & deceit - then you will probably like this book - me on the other hand, I like to read Nicholas Sparks, Luanne Rice, Elizabeth Berg, Debbie Macomber, Alice Hoffman, etc. - This was not my cup of tea - sorry.	2002-08-22
US	51661790	R19BZNIO8DFMBK	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	3	5	N	N	First True Classic of the 21st Century!!!!	Forget THE CORRECTIONS - Here is the first literary classic of the 21st century.  This is a book which should be read by and enjoyed by readers of most ages - 9-90!!!! The story's subject sounds horrific and I admit, when I first read the summary I didn't think it was the kind of book I would want to read.  But then I began to hear more and more buzz about it and gave it a second look.  Thank goodness I did!  This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time - And to think, this is Alice Sebold's first novel (her first book was an autobiography).  The story begins with - without the gruesome details - the brutal rape, murder and dismemberment of young Susie Salmon (like the fish!).  From the second chapter forward you will begin to see life on Earth as Susie sees it from \\"her heaven\\" - Susie follows her friends and family around for the next 10 years and witnesses, as the reader does, the heartaches, joys, successes, failures, mistakes and progress they all make as a result of Susie's death.  It seems ridiculous at first when Susie talks about her intake counselor in heaven - but as the reader reads on, you begin to see Susie's heaven and imagine that perhaps, heaven is whatever you want it to be - whatever our hearts and minds make it.  According to this book, each person's heaven is what they want and/or need it to be.  It's actually a very comforting thought.  As the reader goes through each chapter and learns how each character grows and changes, you witness how Susie's death affected each of the characters and made them into the people the people that they become.  In other words, each character goes through changes and grows in ways that wouldn't have otherwise been possible if Susie had not died when she was 13 years old.  There are some parts when the reader may question the reality of the situation and may think that Ms. Sebold has gone too far - as when a \\"Ghost\\"- like experience places Susie back on Earth in her friend's Ruth's body and how the dastardly Mr. Harvey meets his maker  (believe me, you can't imagine it - you have to read it to believe it!).  But other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can easily see how it could become the first real classic of the 21st century.  It should be require reading for High School English classes, Creative Writing classes and anyone who wants to enjoy a really, really good, thought-provoking book.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!	2002-07-09

I loved last year's THURSDAYS AT EIGHT, but this time Ms. Macomber outdid herself.  BETWEEN FRIENDS is the story of the lifelong friendship between Jillian and Lesley - The story is told uniquely through the use of letters, journals entries, emails (later on in their lives), wedding & birth announcements, newspaper articles - even the occasional gas station receipt!  You follow Jillian and Lesley from the day they were born (through the birth announcements of their parents) all the way up through the summer of 2002.  What is so wonderful and makes this novel worth reading again and again, is how Ms. Macomber uses actual historic events to tell this story and move the friends through life.  You will read about how Vietnam touched both girls and had a lasting affect on Jillian; how they each felt and reacted to the assassinations of JFK, Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy; what their feelings were about Women's Lib; connecting to each other via email and going \\"online\\"; even the tragic events of Sept. 11th are briefly touched upon (only wisely, Ms. Macomber spent little time on this subject and only used the event to explain the feelings of the two women today).  You will see Lesley and Jillian experience life & death, the birth of children, loves of their lives entering and leaving; and the joys and heartache that see them through 50 years of friendship.  You will witness not only the love Jillian and Lesley have for each other, but the love for their family and friends and the love these people have for each of them.  Sometimes funny, plenty reminiscent, but mostly heartfelt, this story will stay with you forever and I guarantee you will return to this book again and again over the years if for no other reason, then to relive some point and time in our history that may have had a similar affect on you and your life as it had on Lesley and Jillian.  Bravo Debbie Macomber - it will be difficult to top this one!  (but I know you'll try!)	2002-06-24

I have become a fan of Elizabeth Berg since reading ORDINARY LIFE last year - and TRUE TO FORM is &quot;True to Berg&quot;!  This is a story of 13 Katie nash and the events that shape her life during one summer vacation.  She babysits the nieghbors three boys, helps take care of her elderly neightbors, and runs around and spends her free time with her one true friend, Cynthia.  It's easy to see ourselves as 13 year olds during our summer breaks - bike riding; lying in the grass watching the clouds; planning for the new school year; fighting-making up-getting along with our best friends!  It's all there in this fast read.  It's not a deep read that you wuill go WOW! with, but it is satisfying and will bring back memories which is why I gave it 5 stars - If you like Elizabeth Berg be sure not to miss this one - even if you're like me and you've never herd of Katie Nash before - you will want to know about her after reading TRUE TO FORM.	2002-06-10

If Ann Packer's future books are similar in themes and style to Last Dive, then she's got a new fan in me. I enjoyed this book and thought it was a wonderful read. The book is full of messages and lessons - most readers will learn something from at least one of the characters. Ms. Packer was able to reach an emotional level in me many authors aren't able to do- I can't tell you how many times I found myself shaking my head in disgust after the latest of Carrie's decisions. A less effective author would have readers disliking Carrie Bell, perhaps or maybe even discontinuing their read, but Ms. Packer kept the reader interested and installed real feelings about each character. Some may think Carrie is a spoiled brat who runs from hard times - but if you read carefully, you'll come to learn that Carrie is just scared of what most young 20 years olds are afraid of - growing up. I think because of the accident, Mike was forced to mature much faster than Carrie was ready to. Her escape to New York was not only an escape of the horrifying realism she left behind in Madison, it was a way to capture the happiest days of her life - her adventurous teen years - when she & Mike first fell in love. Over the months, and through the many events that eventually lead her back to Madison, we see Carrie grow and mature. Slowly realizing that she can still have the same joys and happiness that she once shared with Mike and Jamie - just not as carefree as she once was. The happiness is still there, it just comes with added responsibility. Sometimes I thought the story went on and on a little too much - that maybe some chapters or explanations could have been shortened, or even eliminated altogether, but overall I enjoyed the book and look forward to future Ann Packer novels. I highly recommend this to women of all ages - You will all see a part of you tucked away inside one of these characters!!!	2002-05-07

I have never read one of Bohjalian's books before even though I had purchased Midwives a few months back (it is still sitting on my shelf), but I guarantee this will not be the last one of his books I read.  I have since ordered his last two books and look forward to reading those.  This book follows the story of a couple who's twin daughters are killed during a flood, the foster son they take into their home two years later, the elderly couple who live across the street and the single, pregnant girlfriend who lives miles away and has never met any of the other characters except for the twins' father.  Each chapter is told from the point of view of one of the characters and the story moves forward very rapidly.  Although the book is close to 400 pages, the story is not dragged out and I never found myself skimming the pages or flipping forward just to get on with the story (as I have in some other books I've recently read).  Every page has a point and each point flows to the next and I never found myself bored or anxious to get on with it - quite the opposite actually.  I was sorry when I finished each chapter, wanting to hear more from that particular character only to go on to the next chapter and get just as interested in that character's point of view.  I found myself routing for the foster child and mother, laughing at the elderly couple and frustrated and disappointed in the father's younger brother and even some of the father's actions.  Descriptions are good and I could easily imagine the towns where the story took place. The story includes a few historical points also about the Buffalo SOldiers since the elder gentleman gives the foster child a book on the subject to read.  Each chapter is introduced with a piece of history referring to those times and the Buffalo Soldiers and the reader will learn a little bit more about that time in history.  I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading other books by Chris Bohjalian and his next release (whenever that may be - it sems life he spaces them about 18 months apart).  If you like Alice Hoffman, you will most likely become a fan of Bohjalian since their styles are similar (characters linked together by a specific incident and stories that flow forward without hestiation).  I know that I've become a fan and am happy I chose to read this book.	2002-03-14

This is a pretty quick and entertaining read.  As the author states in the first paragraph, there isn't very much out there directed at the spouse of a breast cancer patient, so he decided to solve that problem.  The author is able to relate his story of his wife's battle with breast cancer with a little bit of sentiment and a lot of humor.  Some of the author's topics were a little over the top (several references to 70 & 80 rock bands, the author's school days, etc).... But I applaud his honesty and bravery.  Of course, the book only covers about 6-9 months of his wife's battle.  He even admits that if you're looking for finality - an ending - don't look for it here.  For this reason, I think he should have perhaps waited a little longer before writing this book. It almost feels like this book was rushed into publication. As a woman who does not have breast cancer, it left me with several questions.  I'm sure the spouses of breast cancer patients would have like a few more words of encouragement and a lot more info about what happens next but I'm sure they will be able to take comfort from most of what the author writes about learning that they are not alone.  I understand that he felt he was putting something out there that was missing, but I couldn't help feeling that what is written in this book is somewhat incomplete.  Still, I enjoyed the read and learned some new things I didn't kow about cancer.  Maybe it is the author's intent to write a sequel down the road - just to keep us up to date and let know how it all turned out.  If that's true, I'll proabably read that one too, just to see how it worked out.	2002-03-06

I really wanted to give this book 4  stars, but that's not an option.  This was an absolutely fabulous book!  I had never heard of John Burnham Schwartz but I had read a review of this book in this month's Elle magazine and thought it sounded like something I might enjoy - that's an understatement!!!!  I couldn't get enough.  As I finished each chapter, I went back and re-read the parts I enjoyed the most because I didn't want it to end.  The story is beautifully written as are the descriptions throughout.  You can see the colors, smell the scents, hear the sounds and taste the tastes!!! It all begins with a yellow umbrella and the color yellow is referred to again throughout the book.  Parts of the book will break your heart while others will uplift you and then there are the parts that will infuriate you - make you yell into the pages \\"WHAT ARE DOING & WHY?!?!?\\"  The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because of its ending.  While I know the author is allowing you to decide for yourself what the character does, I didn't like it.  I would have liked a more complete definitive ending.  Although it does leave room for a sequel (could this be possible?) I doubt that's what the author meant.  It was a beautiful ending, however, I just like my stories wrapped up at the end - one way or another.  With the ending the author gives us, the reader is left to their own to decide for themselves how the story ends.  A great story, wonderful book - one I  intend to keep & return to when I want a meaningful, loving read.  Great job Mr. Schwartz!  If your future books are anything like Claire Marvel, you have gained a new fan!!!	2002-02-21

I left an earlier review, but one thing I neglected to mention was how descriptive this book is.  While reading the descriptions of the scene on each page, it is easy to put yourself right there and imagine yourself living in Italy in the 1600s.  For example, while describing the herb garden at the convent, you can almost smell the oregano described on the page!!

Having known nothing about Artemisia, I purchased this book because I enjoyed Girl in Hyacinth Blue.  Let me tell you, this book is soooo much better!!!  Although the book is a work of fiction, I followed the career of Artemisia by printing a collection of her paintings from the internet and followed her career as I read along.  It's too bad the book didn't include pictures of her various paintings (similar to Lydia Cassatt Reading the Morning Paper)- that would have made the book so much better!!!  The story follows Artemesia from the age of 18 when she was raped by her father's friend through her adult hood (about the age of 41).  You learn of the various people she met and worked for and how she came to paint the paintings she did.  Of course this is Ms. Vreeland's view on how her ideas formed, but they are strong and believable thoughts.  My biggest complaint was the book's ending.  I found it incomplete and lacking.  It needed a more definite ending instead of the one that was published.  I was left turning the pages, asking \\"Is that it?\\" In spite of its ending, I would highly recommend this book to art lovers, fans of the 17th century, romance readers, readers who enjoy a good moth/daughter relationship.  It's all there in these 275+ pages.  I anxiously await the next book by Sue Vreeland - after \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" and now the improvement of  \\"Artemeisa\\", her next book should be even better!!!	2002-02-04

If you're a fan of Luanne Rice or have read one of her many other books, you will instantly see the similarities here - Girl & Boy meet after knowing each other for years, traumas & dramatics involving children, recognizing one's own fears & dreams, overcoming & making them come true.  It's all there.  I liked this story and I more or less liked the characters, although I found the character of Quinn (Dana's 12 year old niece) a little troubling.  While I know she is meant to be a sympathetic character, I found her character somewhat unbalanced - at times she behaved like the 12 year old she is, at others she became a 4 year old.  Some of her actions and words that came from her mouth are not typical of a 12 year old today, no matter how much grief they have experienced in their life.  I found her behavior at times troubling & I wished I could reach into the pages, yank her out & give her a good lecturing.  An adolescent in the \\"real world\\" who behaved as Quinn did throughout the book would either be on some type of medication or in therapy or both.  Looking beyond that, I pretty much enjoyed the story, even though I was able to predict what would happen by Chapter 3!!!  If you're a fan of Luanne Rice or like a good family-love story, you'll probably enjoy this book.  I look forward to her next piece of work but hope that she may start varying her storylines a little - It's becoming hard to tell where one book ends and the next one begins.  They're all so similar!!!	2002-01-29

I picked up this book because I liked the cover and when I discovered it was the fictional story behind five of Mary Cassatt's paintings, I knew I had to read it.  I have always loved Cassatt's art and this book tells the story behind the five portraits May painted of her sister Lydia and includes copies of the paintings themselves among the book's pages.  Of course this is a work of fiction and comes from Chessman's imagination, but nevertheless, it is a wonderful, beautiful, thoughtful and insightful story of how those portraits may have come to life.  It is a short novel (160 pgs) and can be read in one sitting.  That is the reason for my 4* review instead of 5.  I really enjoyed the story and thought it was wonderfully written, but I felt it could have been a little longer and a few more details could have been revealed.  For instance, while Lydia speaks often of her deceased brother, and her earlier lover, there isn't a whole lot of details about them.  Also, I'd like to know more about relationship between Lydia and Mary away from the painting. Don't misunderstand - I absolutely LOVED this book.  I just would have liked to have continued my reading and now I'm searching for further info about the Cassatts and other writings by Chessman!!!!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Mary Cassatt's artwork, who enjoys a wonderful story about sisterhood, or the hopelessly romantic reader - none of you will be let down!!!	2002-01-08

For the longest time I stayed away from period fiction.  I wasn't interested in reading stories from the early 1900s or stories from England.  I'm  happy to say that Tracy Chevalier has changed all that.  I actually read &quot;Falling Angels&quot; first, then went back and read &quot;...Pearl Earring.&quot; While there are similarities between the two stories, the one marked difference is that Pearl Earring was told from the sole point of view of the housemaid - Falling Angels is told from various points of view.  You can read the book in the eyes of any one of the characters in the story.  You will never get lost either - you will always know who's point of view you are reading since Ms. Chevalier uses headings and always informs the reader whose point of view the next chapter is from.  This is a wonderful way to tell a story.  When there are several characters on the canvas, it is easy to get lost in who's telling who what and when, but with Ms. Chevalier's writing style, you always know who's feeling what and why or why a character chooses to act as they do.  You can grow to love a character you once disliked, and trust the characters you distrusted in the beginning.  I am anxious to read more of Ms. Chevalier's work and understand she is currently working on her next novel.  I'm hoping it's out soon (I'm also looking for some of her earlier pieces of work which I understand are short stories), but in the meantime, I have Ms. Chevalier to thank for opening the door to stories told around this time period - I've since read some wonderful novels written about England and the early 1900s, late 1800s and I'm currently reading and enjoying &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue.&quot; (about the painter Vermeer featured in Pearl Earring)  My eyes have been opened to some wonderful story telling!  Thank you and keep 'em coming!	2001-12-13

After reading &quot;Falling Angels&quot; and totally falling in love with Tracy Chevalier's writing style, I just had to go back and read the best seller &quot;...Pearl Earing.&quot;  I was not disappointed.  I usually stay away from period pieces and cannot usually enjoy reading about any period of time before I was born (maybe it's because I find it hard to identify with it), but these two books were so worth the read.  Pearl Earing takes place in the 1600's (exactly 300 years before I was born, mind you!!) and it is a fictional telling of how Vermeer's famous painting came to be.  The actual painting doesn't take place until nearly the end of the book and then it sort of felt rushed, but as the reader, I didn't feel cheated of anything.  It didn't seem like any part of the puzzle was missing.  I did think the exact ending was a little predictable and neatly wrapped up, but other than that, I thought the book was fantastic.  I anxiously await the next piece of fiction from Ms. Chevelier and thank her for drawing me into stories that take place before I was born.  I can now get a history lesson while I am doing one of my favorite pastimes (reading).  If you enjoy period pieces or modern romances or stories about strong women - A Girl With the Pearl Earing is the book for you.  At less than 250 pages and small in size, it's a breeze of a read - You'll be begging for more and counting the months until Ms. Chevelier publishes her 3rd &amp; next novel!!	2001-11-28

This is the first book I have read by Sue Miller, and while I don't think it would be my last, her next book needs to be stronger than World Below.  It's the kind of story I like to read - Divorced mother, looking into her family's past, beautiful setting, good family  relations (I especially liked the relationship between Cath &amp; her daughter Fi!).   A romantic read without all the gooey, sappy romance and love scenes!!!  It started out pretty good and I continued turning the pages waiting for the story to kick in, but it never really seemed to get going.  At times confusing, you couldn't be certain if you reading Cath's story of today, or Georgia's story of yesterday until you reached someone's name.  It is a very conflicting read.  I want to give it a lower rating because I feel it could have been so much better, but yet, parts are moving and beautifully written.  The descriptions alone stand-out from other books I've recently read.  If you like to have a scene described in great detail, Sue Miller does just that.  I just didn't feel she completely told this story.  Many things are left out there, incomplete - Is the reader supposed to use their imagination, or is there no finality to it?  The story seems to move forward slowly and when the reader reaches the end, many questions still remain.  I can also easily see this being a Made-For-TV-Movie - you know, the ones they show on Sunday nites?!  It almost seems like it was written with a movie deal as the basic goal.  I don't think this will be the last book I read by Sue Miller, but another book by this author must have a wonderful storyline and have some definition to it in order for me to give it a try.	2001-10-29

My only complaint and the only negative part of my review of Still Waters is that this brings us to the end of Jennifer's story (unless she writes another sequel 30 years from now to show how the rest of her life turns out!).  I hope Jennifer continues writing and will perhaps try her hand at fiction.  One of the things I most loved about both Blackbird and Still Waters is how they read like a novel.  I couldn't turn the pages fast enough yet I was so disappointed when I was done knowing that this completed her story bringing us up to current times.  You will find yourself almost disbelieving some of the things that have happened to Jennifer believing that no one could suffer such heartache and still end up as sane and normal as Jennifer is.  I have seen Jennifer on Oprah (last year when Blackbird was released) and The Rosie O'Donnell show (this year with Still Waters) and she is a beautiful, intelligent, happily married mother of two (yes, she is expecting - CONGRATULATIONS!)  I was able to draw strength and courage from Jennifer's words - If she could survive the horrific things that happened to her and still turn out as wonderful as she has, there's hope for us all!!!  Readers of true life stories, biographies, family related issues, and fiction will all find something to lover about Still Waters.  It is Jennifer's memoirs yet filled with life lessons and as I said earlier, it reads like a novel.  I hope Jennifer continues to write and I will be watching for future releases from this talented, beautiful, inspiring writer.	2001-10-29

I'm only sorry that Jennifer's story stops here and the only way we can read more of her memoirs is if she writes them 30-40 years from now after she's lived an even fuller life!!!!  Perhaps Jennifer can write a novel now based on her life or the people she has met along her travels.  One of the things I liked about both books was that they read like novels.  Several times while reading, you could easily get lost in characters and story lines and think that this story was a fascinating novel - but then you remind yourself that it's not fiction - just a story of a fascinating life!!!!  Congratulations Jennifer - you are a brave, young soul who has lived enough to last three liftimes - Perhaps that what you did - you are living life not just for yourself, but for your mother, father &amp; brother too.  I deeply admire you and hope you continue to write - I'm sure it has been healing just as much reading it has made me realize how little we need today to feel fulfilled and loved.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a fascinating read - whether it be fiction or nonfiction.  As I said before, it's not a typical memoir, if you don't normally read biographies or memoirs, you can easily pretend this is a novel and you will enjoy it that much more!!	2001-10-19

I had not read Alice Hoffman before Blue Diary, but when I finished, I purchased as many of her previous novels as I could lay my hands on - her writing is that good. This book is full of descriptions and I liked how the chapters alternated between the points of view of the wife and the little girl next door. The story flows nicely and you're never left wondering how or why a certain character may have done or said something. Alice Hoffman provides just enough history and character development so that the reader can easily understand why the little gir's sister would be attracted to such an older man, why the wife felt the way she did on her trip out of town, why the son changed his actions so dramatically. You come to know and love these characters so you never have to say \\"No way - that would never happen\\", because with Alice Hoffman's writing, you can easily understand why things happen the way they do. Great book and I am looking forward to reading the several other Alice Hoffman novels I have since purchased!	2001-08-24

Nicholas Sparks has long been a favorite author of mine and I anxiously await the 364 days in between finishing his latest book and reading his next release the following fall.  Now, hopefully, James Patterson can fill some of that void.  While I will agree with some of the other reviews that it was slightly &quot;sugary sweet&quot; and just a little bit sappy (hence - 4 stars, not 5), it was satisfying enough to devour in 24 hours (that's another reason for the 4 stars - I wish it were longer).  It is a very fast read - short chapters, short &quot;sections&quot;.  It definitely reads as if you were reading someone else's diary - you may even find yourself hoping you won't get caught!  There should have been more story in between - there was some attempt at that, but not enough.  While I feel I got to know Suzanne, Matt &amp; Nicholas, I don't feel I got to know Katie that well, or learned enough about her relationship with Matt. That area should have been explained and explored a little bit more. Mr. Patterson relied heavily on the diary itself to tell the story, and it just isn't long enough to fill a satisfying book.  I do hope Mr. Patterson writes another book of this type - I have to be honest, I've never read any of his other work because I don't like thrillers or mysteries - but I do hope he gives &quot;women's fiction&quot; or &quot;Modern Romance&quot; another try.  He could easily fill the gap in the year in between Nicholas Sparks' releases!!!  I'm always looking for something to fill that void and so far, Mr. Patterson's book has come closest.  Thank you for giving me another satisfying book to hold me over until September when &quot;Bend in the Road&quot; is released - Maybe your next book can come out next spring!!!!	2001-07-24

I have to be honest - this was the first Jacquelyn Mitchard I have read.  I never read DEEP END OF THE OCEAN because the storyline was troubling to me, and by the time I decided I might want to give it a try, it was a movie, which ruined the book completely.  So when I heard about THEORY back in April, I anxiously awaited and counted the days until its release.  I knew Ms. Mitchard is a popular and, I heard, fantastic author and the advance reviews all predicted great reading with a heartwrming story.  What book were those reviewers reading?  The dialogue in this book is great and the second to last chapter really moves along with quick dialogue between two of the characters - but that's it.  The first half of the book is nonstop descriptions - the car accident, the illness, the farm, the school, Gordon's teaching background - on and on and on it goes.  It feels like you're reading an article in a woman's magazine about a local family's custody battle.  Where's the story, where's the character development, where's the dialogue????  The few conversations that do take place are pointless - two in particular left me asking &quot;HUH?&quot;  What was the point? (Ch. 13 - between Nora &amp; Hayes and Ch. 15 between Gordon &amp; Lindsay)  Many of the conversations and dialogue between characters are pointless and lead to no where - some of the descriptions are also pointless and seem to have been written to just fill a page (what was the point of Nora's thought on the farm?  It was never mentioned again and was never the topic of conversation or even an issue)  This book could have been so much better if Ms. Mitchard had just written more interaction between characters and dialogue.  The characters are often alone in a room with their thoughts and that's what you're reading - what is going on in the minds of the main characters.  Not enough interaction or speaking to each other.  The most important events are skimmed over too quickly leading to more reading about what thecharacters thought of what just happened.  I would probably give Ms. Mitchard another chance based on her history and what other people have said about her writing - if the next book was about a subject I was interested in reading about that is.  Hopefully, this was just a &quot;slump&quot; and the next book will be as good as her first.	2001-07-18

Finishing this book left me disappointed - I wanted more!!  The way the book ends, however, leaves room for a sequel and I hope Ms. Macomber considers it.  I liked the style this book was written in.  The story is about the lives of four friends and each chapter is dedicated to one of the four friends.  Most chapters open with entries in their journals and then continues with their story.  By about 3/4 of the way through the book, each friend's story is intertwined with that of at least one of the other three friends.  I understand Ms. Macomber has been writing Romance Novels for some time (this was the first of her books I've read), but this book is so much more than a Romance.  I really liked this book and hope there are more like it to come.	2001-06-10

The characters in this book are very likable - right down to the drug dealer who befriends Myra and is there for her in her most definite time of need. The story follows the similar love triangle you may read about with the teenage or mid-20's age group - But these characters are middle age - all in their early 50's. You will find yourself talking to the characters out loud trying desperately to convince them that their thoughts are incorrect and that yes, indeed, they are lovable.

The writing was beautiful and on every page, the characters came to life inside my head.  As a mother and daughter myself, I easily identified with both characters as will many other readers.  It is a definite MUST-READ for every mother/daughter out there.  I guarantee that you will see yourself as the child in one chapter, then as the parent in the next.  Congratulations on a wonderful book - if the word is spread, this will definitely be a Best Seller.  Hope to see more work like this one from Kristin Hannah in the future	2001-05-24

This book, however, was not your typical &quot;Romance Novel&quot;, but more a story of friendship with some love stories on the side. The characters are easily imaginable - I'm sure veryone has a friend like Madison, Ruby or Nora. This is the ideal book to read while laying on the beach - or sunning in your own backyard while the kids run wild. My only complaint about this book has nothing to do with the story, but as you get closer to the end of the book, some of the lines and descriptions are a little repetitious. It seemed that things should have been described once and the story continued, but the author describes a person or scene on one page and then 2-3 pages later, makes the same description about the same person or scene. Other than that, I loved the book and would read another one of Ms. Deveraux's books if it were written like this one - This book was more like the works of Nicholas Sparks or Luanne Rice - not Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown - and I liked that!!	2001-05-24

I bought this book on a whim and since that time, I've read several reviews about it.  I'm glad I picked it up &amp; read it.  It's a fairly simple read - the author sometimes writes in incomplete sentences and discusses only the main points of her journey with her daughter.  She never goes on &amp; on about one subject or event.  She describes her feelings perfectly and as a mother of a teenage daughter myself, I could relate to many of her fears &amp; dreams.  I didn't like how the book wrapped up.  Of course, I don't want to give anything away, but I felt like there was more to say &amp; I didn't think it explained how she resolved (or didn't resolve) her situation.  Of course, there is an Epilogue which is meant to bring the reader up to date since the author's writing, but maybe Ms. Dudman should have waitied a year or two to tell her story so that readers would have a more complete story.  I feel she left the readers hanging - unless she is planning a sequel (I don't think there would be enough material, however).  I would recommend parents (especially mothers) of teenagers (girls &amp; boys) read this book. I'm sure everyone can find a piece of their lives somewhere within these pages!  I also, recommend sharing it with your child.	2001-04-10

I am a married female and I found the story this book told to be that of loving parents trying to do what it is we all try to do - take care of &amp; provide for our children no matter what it takes.  Michael &amp; Jon had so much against them, but knew that the love they had for their children, and for each other, would prevail and they would be granted the right to jointly adopt the foster child they had lovingly taken care of since his early weeks of life.  There are so many married couples who could NEVER have accomplished all they did with Adam, and the state of NJ attempted to withhold their well-earned right to adopt Adam jointly.  This books tells the loving story of two fathers and how they grew into a family of 5.  The book is narrated alternately by Jon and Michael (they wrote alternate chapters) and you can just see the love flow off of the pages.  I would challenge anyone who ever had an uncertain negative thought about two gay men raising a child together to read this story and not come away from it feeling that in the end, Adam's best interests were served and those of his two sisters (one a teenager, who by the way, REQUESTED that they adopt her!).  I also would challenge a married heterosexual couple to attempt to follow the same path Jon &amp; Michael do and see what the end result for them is.  I guarantee, not many couples could accomplish all that they did.  Thank you for giving me wonderful read and one I will truly never forget!  Your story is truly an inspiration for parents everywhere!	2001-03-23

Jerri Nielsen does a good job describing conditions and the environment at the South Pole.  She gives enough information and supplies the right photos so that the reader can easily imagine what the scene may look like as you are reading.  The problem I had with the book was that I felt it didn't cover enough of Jerri's own story - Yes, she explains her adventures and then her horrifying cancer situation, but the last 1/4 of the book is mostly email correspondence between Jerri and her Dr, Jerri and her family, Jerri and her friends.  I think this is due to the fact the her memory may not be as clear to these facts (she states this several times - how the ice effects memory), but I would have liked to have seen her interpret her emails into the story, rather than print them all - word for word - in between her storytelling.  I also did not like the abrupt ending of the book.  While I know the book is called ICE BOUND and is mainly about her time on the ice - the book ends with her rescue from the South Pole with a few pages of Epilogue following.  After reading about her fears and concerns (which almost every email contains), I would like to have seen them addressed more definitively.  We never do find out the answers to all of her questions, and how she finally got over her fears, nor do we find out how her relationship with her fellow Polies was affected once they returned to the States (we do know she saw several of them,but not much more detail then that) Overall, it's a good story, and easy to get involved in.  I'm not sorry I read it, just a little disappointed and not completely satisfied at the end.	2001-03-12

I heard about it back in October, and as the day got closer, I began to get excited.  Boy, was I disappointed.  The story carries a bit of a mystery (which I'm not a huge fan of any way), but believe me when I tell you - NO SUSPENSE WHATSOEVER!!!!  I figured out the ending less than 100 pages into the story.  I only continued reading because I was curious how long it would take the characters to figure out what I already knew - It took until about the last 2-3 chapters - then the story was rushed forward to wrap it up nicely leaving no loose ends whatsoever.  She took all this time dragging out the story - following the characters around &amp; basically getting to know them (which was one of the pluses of this book &amp; why I gave it three stars - good character development), only to have the ending rushed through way too quickly.  I also found it senseless to have new characters, never mentioned at all earlier, introduceed in the final chapters of the book.  They made brief appearances apparently in an effort to fill up pages - How else can it be explained?  I don't want to give it away - there may be others who find this story interesting &amp; would like to figure it out for themselves, I just felt totally let down and disappointed way before I finished reading this book, and for once, was glad when I finished reading it so I could go on to my next book!	2001-02-14

This is the first book I have read by Richard Evans (aside from the children's book &quot;The Dance&quot;).  I was not disappointed.

This book read very well, the story flowed nicely, the characters were well-defined, and everything happened for a reason.  While some people may call this a &quot;sappy love story&quot;, I choose to look at it as a painful, but must-have lesson about life and love.  Growing up and coming of age - you know - the twenty-something years where you are no longer a child, but not yet a &quot;real&quot; grown-up.  I will definitely go back and read some of Mr. Evans' other pieces - beginning with the prequel to this story.  I highly recommend!!!	2000-12-04

I was lucky enough to be part of a book signing event by Annie Leibovotz which makes this book even more special to me.  Each photo tells a moving story of the person pictured and I find myself puliing this book out often just to remind myself who I am.  Every woman can identify with at least one of the photos, if not all of them.  I recommend this book to women everywhere as a reminder of who we are and how far we have come over the years.	2000-09-28

I like Luanne Rice's writing style, which is very similar to that of Nicholas Sparks who is my favorite author of fiction.  I sometimes find it hard to get going with novels, but this one held my attention.  Maybe because I had a child with spina bifida who passed on, but I believe the whole story will capture your attention and heart.  The characters are likeable, even when they are supposed to be &quot;bad&quot;.  It flowed nicely and didn't drag on and on.  My only disappointment was the ending, which I felt could have been wrapped up a little more completely.  I look forward to Ms. Rice's next novel	2000-09-28

The book tells the high points and downfalls, and all of the mistakes and correct moves taken by each individual.  In one chapter, you may fully blame the President, but in the next you can see how Kenneth Starr pushed the limits and took advantage of his position - perhaps in the same manner Mr. Clinton did.  Not one person was blameless or guilty of wrong doing, but they were also not fully innocent.  This is the one and only book I have read on the subject and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read the closest to the full story we will ever hear.  I hear they are making a movie based on this book.  I am curious to see how that will be played out.	2000-09-28
US	51661790	R1RF7XI6F6JB7Y	0446525502	717558254	The Rescue	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Another fine piece of fiction	I purchased this book two days ago and am almost done with it.  While I am normally a fan of biographies and true life stories, I always find Nicholas Sparks' books fantastic.  It usually takes me days to start getting in to works of fiction, but Nicholas Sparks never disappoints.  I'm sucked in on the very first page and can't put it down.  It's easy to picture the characters and bring them to life while reading.  The story is dramatic, but not melodramatic. Every sentence leaves you anxiously awaiting the next line.  There are similarities to Sparks' other pieces of work, but enough differences to make it an interesting new story.  My only complaint is that when I finish reading any of Sparks' books, I must wait an entire year before reading his newest story and as hard as I try, I can never find another piece of fiction that captures my attention and holds my interest as much as Nicholas Sparks does.  Keep em coming, but maybe a little faster (2 a year maybe?)	2000-09-22

I did, and I was fairly  satisfied.  The first 1/2 of the book was very interesting and I learned  many new things about women I had never heard of before but learned have  great power in Hollywood and were responsible for some of the very movies I  have loved over the years.  Now when I see the name Sherry Lansing or Polly  Plat in print, I know exactly who they're speaking of.  I appreciate movies  like Forest Gump &amp; Fatal Attraction all that much more now because I  know the story behind them.  The second 1/2 of the book dropped off a  little.  It seemed to drag on a little too much, and probably could have  been 2-3 chapters shorter.  The final few chapters are good again &amp;  renewed my interest.  Too bad I can't use 1/2 a star, because I'd actually  rate this a 3 1/2, but 4 is pretty close.  Overall, I don't think you'll be  disappointed unless you're a chauvanist or a man who still thinks a woman's  place is in the kitchen or barefoot &amp; pregant - although it would  probably teach some of those people a lesson!   Defintiely worth buying in  hardcover!	2000-08-16

Obviously, if you only know Judy Garland from Oz or St. Louis, you have no business reading this book until you know more about her &amp; her tortured life. I've read all  of the books including Lorna Luft's very own &amp; found this one to be by  far the most honest, straight-forward, non-biased, truthful book available  about Judy. It is NOT a book about her movie career - there are already  many of those - it's a book about her sad &amp; troubled life. My only  complaint is that there weren't enough pix to reference to as the story was  being told - I had to pull out some of my others to see what the author was  describing. I have been a fan since I was very young, &amp; when I heard  this book was coming out, I could not wait. I have treasured each page I've  read &amp; it only makes me more sad that Judy's life had to end so soon  &amp; so many people had to miss out on all of her wonderful talents.   Wouldn't it have been wonderful to see Judy at Oz's 50th Anniversary!  If  you love Judy &amp; know of her troubled life, this book will fill your  heart &amp; make you miss her even more. Her death was totally &amp;  completely unnecessary &amp; no one should ever have to suffer like Judy  did - especially someone who provided so much happiness to those around  her.  We miss you Judy &amp; this book brought you back to life for just a  short while!	2000-04-11

I never really cared much for the Tylos, but after her case against Spelling &amp; the unfortunate tragedy that took place regarding her daughter's cancer, I believed both Hunter &amp; her husband deserved  &quot;another chance&quot;. Boy am I sorry, I gave them one. While I  applaud her for having the courage to sue Spelling &amp; truly hope all  goes well for her daughter, I find it hard to sympathize with her and find  her attitude as that of some one who believes every one around her is out  to get her &amp; that she is a &quot;victim&quot; - that she has done all  she can to forgive - The rest is up to them. Look at her best friend, and  the famous actors whom she rehearsed with &amp; claimed were interested in  nothing but getting her &quot;onto the couch&quot;! How arrogant! She  spends 3/4 of the book discussing sex, drinking &amp; beauty &amp; shares  approx 2 chapters on her beautiful daughter. There is page after page of  Hunter pix and only three with her children (the most recent w/her sons is  several years old).  Any true Hunter fan who loves her as much as she loves  herself will love this book - any one else will be shaking their heads in  disbelief &amp; disgust!	2000-03-20
