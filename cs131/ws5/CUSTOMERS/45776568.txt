Maybe it's my fault that I absolutely felt nothing for these characters. The writers style is sooo tedious. It's all flowery description, that is wonderful at first, but after a while you want some kind of forward progression in the story. Even two-thirds into the story, I was still waiting for some reason to pick this book up again and keep reading. I don't have a lot of time to read so I really pick my books carefully and, except for a few choice sentences,  I just regret the time I spent on this souless story that seemed to have so much promise. What a waste of a great story idea.	2005-07-05

How could you possibly expect anyone to top \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About A Boy\\"? Nick Hornby has really hit his stride with this novel. Like all his stuff, it is a million things at once, funny, sad, ugly and beautiful. As I read this book I just kept shaking my head because the characters were becoming so real to me and I was starting to love each one of them, huge flaws and all. What an accomplishment and what a remarkably fresh voice this writer has. I LOVED IT.	2005-07-05

What a fantastic idea to have this story told from four different points of view. That is the very nature of this controversial subject, the way people would all react so individually to such a situation and all the confusing emotions that must come along with it. <br />I could not put it down. My TV wasn't on for days while I was addicted to this book.  I still think my inability to put this book down is slightly responsible for the less than sterling results of my college math exam. <br />The ending is strange and maybe not realistic but who are we to say? The whole theme of the novel is about the unpredictibility and power of a love most of us can't even fathom. It is written sympathetically and with care and love. I really adored this read.	2005-04-15

It's smart, unexpected, ironic, sweet and dark. This film is an example of storytelling at it's best and puts big budget blockbusters with no real heart to shame.

I was so looking forward to reading this book that I waited until my midterms were over and then set a whole day aside to read it.  I shouldn't have bothered.  Granted, some parts were really interesting and I kept looking at Dare Wright's beautiful pictures to imagine her strange life but it certainly wasn't gripping enough to make a real impression.  I was expecting a really juicy read and it was just kind of flat.  So her mother was over protective! So she had a platonic crush on her brother! (It's understandable in context because they were seperated very young). And a lot of the strange things that happened to her later in life are because she was simply an alcoholic.   It gave me a lot of facts and impressions from a writer who didn't even know her but at the end I knew very little about what emotionally made up this strange woman.  This book was a huge disappointment and I really wanted it to be great.  If you want juicy bizarre reads go for a Howard Hughs or Truman Capote biography or rent the movie \\"Grey Gardens\\". Even Tatum O'Neil's autobiography was more interesting.	2004-12-15

That is because that is how I always feel about books in general because I am more of a reader than a film addict....although I passionately love both. When I saw this film, it made me wish that I had not been expecting all the quirky images that were in the story. Sometimes things are better left to the eye rather than the page. And seeing as Tim Burton did the story telling, you know you are in excellant hands. So I retract my statement about reading this book before you see the film.  I was PAINFULLY wrong. See the film, be enchanted and then read the book to really get the rhythm and backround of the characters. I stand corrected and I am sorry. Whoops.	2003-10-15

I don't really love his paintings and I think the &quot;scene&quot; he created was fun but as far as writing goes....Andy Warhol is really  surprisingly wonderful .  He is humorous but also hits a nerve about superficial things that makes you look at it all in a new way. He is sweet and manipulative and original and naive and incredibly ahead of his time and these are wonderful qualities for a writer. Enjoy the multiple Marilyn paintings  and the involvement with the Velvet Underground but take him seriously as a writer because I still believe he is unsurpassed.	2003-07-01

Do I really care about these incredibly ignorant and troubled people?  The answer is yes because it is Lynda Barry who is doing the writing.  She is genius at capturing the epitome of characters with a single line or habit and making you care about them despite yourself and that is a mark of a really good author to me. She not only illustrates characters with drawings but with words.  Not a feel good book but if you like the dark sad side of things once in a while, Barry fits the bill.	2003-07-01

I LOVED IT.  I see the arguements against it but they they weren't enough to keep  me from loving the process of reading this author.  Yes, he stammered....so do I when I get insane. Yes, his ego is huge (as a writer and probably a person) but  that's part of having an addictive personality  which added to the truthfulness of the story.   I  was interested enough in the character to hate him and involved enough to love him too. Either way, I am glad I read it myself and didn't  hate it to be controversial or love it to be cool.  I really think it is worth the time it takes to read.  He is an author that, love or hate, we at least  have an opinion about.. . and that has been a long time coming.`	2003-06-30

It has been raining, I had a cold and a few days off to recover. I wanted something light and this was really made for that kind of read.  It doesn't touch the  \\"CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC\\" series as far as writing and character development but it kicks 'BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY\\" butt for plot  and likeablitly. I had the plot twists figured out before they twisted but the everyday \\"Cath\\", the main character is so honest and charasmatic that you can't help but miss her when you are done with the book. I love the way the author doesn't really take issue with her weight either way. Some critics have mentioned it is the tale of a \\"plus-size\\" girl (maybe because of Jemima-J)  but there is never any mention of her size other than the normal struggle every girl has.  <BR>     How refreshing to have a realisic heroine for once.

Some of his sentences are simply poetry. But, the begining of the book is so much better than the end. It tells the struggle of two adolescent boys coming to terms with their sexuality, death and the supression of life with unhappy parents (why are all this writers housewives so miserable?)<BR> Once the boys grow up, they are self involved New Yorkers with very empty lifestyles and hard to care about. The writing is still profound but when I finished this novel I found myself wishing I had known the characters better. The book is very long and goes into a lot of detail so this is a bad sign. Like spending a week with someone on vacation and returning home not knowing anything about them. <BR> I can't criticise Micheal Cunninghams writing because there are truly stunning moments here but I just wish I had understood more about what motivated the characters. Or maybe they were really as shallow as they appeared.	2003-02-28

She actually tries to better herself even if the results are sometime disasterous. I love this writer and the follow up book is just a good. You'll love it.	2003-02-28

An accident prone husband whose intense affection for his wife puts her life in danger. The dry wit of it is so subtle that you'll get a little thrill everytime you catch the sarcasm.<BR> But, like a lot of stories, the funniest part is the telling of the everyday life events. Once a bit of a plot kicks in and the husband is out of the picture it simply fades before our very eyes. Still, the first few chapters alone are worth the price of the book. Very dark and very very funny.	2003-02-28
US	45776568	R3LDWQXUIEKTGH	0312305060	785940945	The Hours	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Really good but a little too heavy on description	This is one of those cases where, had I read the book first, I probably would have been in awe of the richness and touching insights in this story. I saw the movie first and loved it so much that I had to read the book that started it all and I was probably wanting the story to move at a different, more visual pace. <BR>The story is amazing and this writer  definately has an incredibly original mind.  My only complaint is that it dwells a lot on lingering descriptions while I am just dying for the story to move on.  Once it does, it's heavenly.  The flow of the story is just sometimes stalled with details.<BR>For instance, in one scene, an assistant brings in a cup of coffee and we have to hear about her story and what she appears to be but what she really is and I just want to hear the conversation of the main characters that is going to take place.<BR>Still, of course, it is a wonderful book and will leave you touched.	2003-01-25
US	45776568	RW825IZ062VKU	0375758739	480592593	Comfort Me with Apples: More Adventures at the Table	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Loved it but with reservations	I really loved this book as I was reading it. I got completely lost in her travels to China and the cafes and countless meals in Paris.  I also loved the story of her struggle to adopt a child and the way she intertwined this all back to food.  But, it is a little hard to really embrace someone who is trying to get you to enjoy details of an affair she has behind her husbands back.  The author seems to only be concerned with her culinary delights and expresses no remorse over her dishonest actions.  I think to really love a book you have to have an affection for the person telling the story and I couldn't help but feel like someone taking the side of an untrustworthy  friend.	2003-01-13
US	45776568	R3WSIJ13B6Q96	014131088X	618877188	Speak	Books	4	0	0	N	N	amazing and memorable	This was really an astonishing book to live through.  It really put me right back in high school with all the painful lessons and the simple naive dramas and joys.  This author has a voice that is touching and clear.  Like the wonderful Perks Of Being A Wallflower, it is hardbreaking and absolutely beautiful at the same time. Do yourself a favor and read it.	2003-01-12

I think one of the all time greatest two pages of childrens picture books is here when the main character leans back into flowers and says to herself \\"I love everything\\". That is a message and sentiment that should be remembered everyday.<BR> Steig has so many rich values in his books that he is being taught in my college as a surpreme storyteller with wonderful messages for kids. He writes in a simple clean way while incorporating rich lessons that children may learn from subconsiously. He is a wonderful writer. This is a wonderful story, as are all his works.	2002-11-14
US	45776568	R31AMPWCID7XDQ	0395389496	546953115	The Polar Express	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Van Allsburg is always fantastic	Van Allsburg is one of my favorite storytellers and this charming X-mas tale is no exception.  Holiday stories can be a bit preachey and sappy sweet but this one maintains the authours mystery and sophistication.  As with all his books, the narritive and illustrations maintain a dreamlike quality that will appeal to all ages.<br />Not one of my favorite Allsburg stories, I prefer \\"Just a Dream\\" and \\"The Sweetest Fig\\", but one that will occupy a proud and well deserved space on my bookshelf.<br />Do yourself a favor and read everything by him, no matter how old you are.	2002-11-14

It was a cross between Geek Love and The Ciderhouse Rules (two of my favorite books).  It was odd and sad and beautiful at the same time.  I just liked the idea of living amoung the people at the Chicago Worlds Fair in 1933 when things that we take for granted now were just being discovered. The author did a great job of putting you right on those streets in that era with characters you start to really to care about.<BR>    Some people complained about the ending and I can kind of see their point.  There is not a lot of resolution but if you read it just to go on a trip into the strange and awesome world of carnivals and the people who inhabit them you will love the ride.	2002-08-18
US	45776568	R274LRZ31TYUAL	0060932813	617082594	Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress	Books	3	2	3	N	N	leave a little above average tip	I really found the premise of this book interesting. And the author has really paid her dues in the food service department. She has that great cynical waitresses humour which can be the best on the planet but is also a little impersonal. Her experience is varied and she portrays it all with a very knowledgable voice. But it is the voice of a toughened heart who has learned to keep a functional, friendly yet guarded smile on her face. <BR> Having been a waitress myself, I know there are a lot of mixed feelings to being a part of this family. It feels like she just doesn't trust you enough to tell you how she really feels about her place in the 'food chain'. <BR>But, it is really a fun read and you'll really appreciate it if you have ever served a dinner to anyone ever in your life.	2002-07-21

Books	5	0	0	N	Y	get ready to read it over and over	My three year old god daughter has me read this to her for the first time the other day and it has been on the top of the request list ever since. She loves the rhythmic style of the story and it's bright light-hearted style.  The author has taken a simple premise and turned it into a playful romp that kids will absolutely love. And it  has gotten her to get dressed and brush her teeth without as much fuss......read it to find out what I mean.  Really fun book.	2002-07-16
US	45776568	R34UKZQ69MLI3T	0609809512	657839683	A Year in Van Nuys	Books	4	2	2	N	N	funny, funny, funny	I don't know what took me so long to finally read this book. The cover and title had me intrigued for ages. I also don't know how I survived my San Fernando Valley upbrining without this bible. But, now that I am aware of this authour, I am a devout follower. What a funny, original, in-sightful read this was. Very light and easy to get through but with some really brave, intelligent and all too real observations. Read it in the summer when you'll relate to her misery in the sweltering heat of the story's setting. I'll never attempt to go to the valley without this book again.	2002-07-16
US	45776568	R2O9YGSNVFX2C7	0375758232	943705979	Paris to the Moon	Books	5	6	7	N	N	get ready for a blissful love affair	When I have gone to Paris myself I have found there are two ways to see the city. You can have a map and camera at the read and jaunt from sight to sight packing it all in or you can just grab a journal and start walking. The style of this book reminds me of those serene walks I have taken in this city. <BR> Gopnik certainly lets his personal and political views be known but they were interestiing to me and it is all part of the experience of accepting new ideas when traveling. I also agree with his politics and respect him very much as a writer.<BR>From the smells of the city, to the everyday sounds of the neighborhood, to the experience of dining in a strange new place I found myself inhabiting that lighthearted and almost dreamlike state I get when I go there myself. By the end of the book I had fallen in love with Paris all over again.<BR>It is definately a 'day in the life of ' book. Not a lot happens. It moves at the slow relaxed pace of a Sunday parisian afternoon. Don't even try this book if you are an impatient reader. If you just like absorbing the local color of a beautiful and complex city...get your passport and start reading.	2002-07-16
US	45776568	R2CLQ6P5O4F94Y	0373250134	559572782	Slightly Single (Red Dress Ink paperback}	Books	2	1	2	N	N	really average	Although this book is completely acceptable as a light summer read, it just never got off the ground for me.  The main character, Tracey, was such a weak person...pandering to her jerk boyfriends every needs and starving herself to be thin.  Her best friend is such a stereotypical drag queen that it makes me wonder if the authour as ever met a gay man in her life.  <BR>     Even if a character has faults, I like the writing to be capable and their voice to be somewhat original. This girl was so weak and insecure that I couldn't find any real empathy for her and I couldn't help but feel I was reading someones junior high attempt at journaling.<BR>     If you want a good summer read in this vein try Confessions Of A Shopoholic or Backpack or How To Be Good.	2002-07-11
US	45776568	R51Q3DJPZNHSF	0671027344	888030084	The Perks of Being a Wallflower	Books	5	0	1	N	N	this book completely took over me	I think this was one of the best books I have ever read.  I fell in love with Charlie and how vunerable and honest he was as a character.  It is one of those books that breaks your heart and makes you cry with joy at the same time. I recommended it to two other people and before I knew it  it had been passed along to a whole group of my friends.  <BR>      It is  simply a \\"day in the life\\" story about a teenage boys' struggle to be accepted but still be true to his gut feelings.  The authour writes with such and strong and unique voice that you really miss the characters when you are finished.  In fact, when I was done with it, I went back to the first page and read it over again.  If there is ever a fire, my worn out copy is one of the things I will grab.	2002-06-28

Nobody but him would have the nerve to tell it exactly as it was without any shame. What a wild trip and what a decadent book. Like eating a bunch of chocolate and topping it off with a pint of tequilla while cranking your favorite heavy metal. Lighten up and you'll love this book.	2002-06-24
