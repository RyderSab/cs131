No one knows he is out of work; hegets up and goes into town, as he normally would. The fortunate reader gets to occupy the imagination of this middle aged ex-accountant as he ponders on sex, family, city life, and death. John Lanchester 's writing is droll and at times will make you laugh out loud. But there is a deeper story in this novel which will move the reader to a feeling of satisfaction and delight at the end of Mr. Phillip's day. Mr. Phillips remains with the reader long after the last page is read. A well written and entertaining novel.	2000-04-13

I never gave up hope that the characters would resolve the situation, and that kept me interested and helped me  appreciate the ending. It was a pleasure to not have a happy-ish ending  tacked on when the tragic wheel is set in motion. Characters are complex  and human. This book was interesting to read and think about later.	2000-04-13

No matter what the topic of discussion, Mr. Mulliner has a story on it and proceeds to enlighten his  listeners. There's Buck-U-Uppo, a tonic recommended for elephant hunters  but taken by a bishop and his pal.  There's the man who sends for a course  in farming by tape and mistakenly gets lessons in assertiveness. The plots  all become terribly complicated in typical Wodehouse fashion. Since reading  this, I have bought a collection of all P.G.Wodehouse's Mr. Mulliner  stories. Next to Jeeves and Bertie, they are my favorites.	2000-01-03

For its entertainment value alone, I rated it highly. I don't often read light novels and enjoy them, but this was an exception for me. I  found it to be amusing, the characters were fun and some of the scenes  downright funny. No, I did not think it added to the book to have both  Jewish women end up with gentiles but it didn't bother me a lot. It was  just a story to entertain and amuse and this book did that well.	1999-08-19

My sisters and I used to read the chapters back and forth to each other and get hysterical. Shirley Jackson had an unusual family and certainly knew how to present them to the reader.

Story of Charley Selkirk who gets kicked out of school for dealing with prejudice in his own way. He meets up with and works for  Tallasee Tynan, a photographer who needs a hand with organizing her studio.  They stumble onto a missing person. In the process of unraveling the  mystery, the reader gets to know both characters pretty well and is privy  to some of Gearino's dry and witty insights into life in the South and  other matters. Don't read it too fast to find out how things are resolved  because you will miss the humor. Well worth reading. Can't wait to see who  he writes about next.	1999-08-03

The Depression, rural vs city life and a reserved, difficult mother are some of the things  that engage the sympathy and interest of readers.

US	51828497	R2AU43P2F2KW01	0679443541	478067272	Helen Keller: A Life	Books	4	3	3	N	N	remarkable.	This is a biography rooted in its time and peopled with those who knew and worked with Helen Keller. She becomes more of a real woman with desires and tribulations other than her physical handicaps. Due to the nature of her  handicaps and the private  inner life she shared with only a selected few,  this book is less than satisfying because the author can only guess at what  transpired in some instances. It demonstrates how isolated she actually  was. Unfortunately many documents that could have clarified some of these  issues were lost. I think that the author did an admirable job under the  circumstances, but I found myself wishing that I really knew more. I  particularly enjoyed the fact that the author took such pains to put Helen  Keller into the context of her time and society. It is sometimes easy to  forget just how remarkable a woman she was.	1999-07-20

Each one is unique and yet they have a common thread. I love the way he writes, his language is simple and clear, yet conveys complex thoughts and ideas. He has a strong voice  which can be heard even through various translators. Humorous and  provocative, he is a joy to read. Always gets me hooked with the first  page. This one is two stories that are resolved in one climax. The hero is  a computer whiz who is hired by a scientist to &quot;shuffle&quot; data and  gets caught up in a mysterious chase. This alternates with a man who comes  to a village to read dreams and become separated from his shadow. You just  have to read it for yourself. Any descriptions don't do it justice.	1999-03-30

Pussy Brady, the hero, struggles with life in Northern Ireland as a transvestite prostitute.   . For all of his scathing remarks, he is vulnerable and the reader will be drawn  to read on. He seems caught in a  world that overwhelms him. Although he plays the sophisticated sarcastic  woman of the world, it is obvious that he is not. It is this gap between  how Pussy would like to be seen and how he is that is so compelling. One  hopes for better things but knows that they are unlikely to happen for him.	1999-03-22

This novel works on many levels: it is a love story and one of revenge, of spiritual journey and  social snobbery, selfishness and love of fellow man. The author tells the  story as a character in the novel. His language is rich yet strangely free  of phrases and cliches that would detract from his story; in this way it  transcends the setting. The lives of its main characters unfold gradually;  we hear only the essential elements that move the story along. It is  intriguing to see how the characters evolve as the novel progresses. First  rate!! It certainly causes you to question what is essential in life.	1999-02-22
