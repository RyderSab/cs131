While his analysis is rigorous, Summers never shows how the war could have been won.  As he points out, the US was unable to pursue the war into North Viet Nam for fear of China entering the war on the ground.  The American planners also feared that if China attacked through North Vietnam, they would also attack in Korea.  And the US could not support a two front war in Asia without serious hardship at home.<br /><br />The only strategy he mentions for \\"winning\\" the war was to put enough troops on the border to prevent North Viet Nam's army from coming into South Viet Nam - sort of turning the American army into the Border Patrol.  But that approach would never have been successful.  The US could not maintain that troop level indefinitely and North Viet Nam would just have waited us out.<br /><br />Once the decision was made not to invade North Viet Nam, the war was un-winnable.  And if you can't win, don't go to war.  That is the real lesson of Viet Nam.<br /><br />Colin Powell learned that lesson and applied it in the first gulf war.  Too bad it was forgotten for the second gulf war.	2005-09-20

Hosker starts with the basics and takes you step by step through the veneering process. In addition to instructions on laying standard veneer, Hosker also attempts to cover parquetry and marquetry.<br /><br /> In fact, this is a weakness of the book - it attmpts to cover everything, which means that the coverage is not as detailed as the reader might like. Additionally, Hosker's focus is on England - the English marquetry society and English suppliers of veneer and supplies - so the book loses some of its value to American readers.<br /><br /> Hosker has another book out titled &quot;Veneering Handbook&quot; which appears to be a predecessor to this book. The information in Veneering Handbook is all contained in this book \\"Veneering: A Complete Course\\" so don't buy the other book.<br /><br /> A couple of other recommended books on Veneering are \\"The Marquetry Course\\" by Jack Metcalf and John Apps, and \\"The Complete Manual of Wood Veneering\\" by William A Lincoln. The latter book is a really complete treatment of veneering but it only has black and white pictures.	2004-08-05

My previous experience with collections of articles has not been good - usually they're just a bunch of unrelated stories with no real continuity or theme.<br />I was very pleasantly surprised by this book.  Although this is a collection of articles that appeared in early issues of Fine Woodworking, they build on each other, with very few &quot;junk&quot; articles in the collection.  The first article discusses the quality of period joinery and quotes a modern woodworker, Robert Emmertt, as having promised himself, &quot;If I ever got to touch a piece of Goddard furniture, I'd never wash my hand.  But now I have seen the back of a genuine Goodard piece and its drawers.  And I wash my hands.  My construction is better.&quot;<br />What the article points out is that our woodworking ancestors built furniture for a living - not for art.  A modern woodworker, even one with a limited shop, can build period furniture that's as good or better than even Townsend and Goodard.  The follow-on articles include pointers to books with measure drawings of period furniture, instructions for building Queen Ann Cabriole legs and Chippendale &quot;claw and ball&quot; feet, and an interesting article on &quot;hidden drawers&quot;.  It also contains instruction for building a blockfront chest, including a scale drawing of two pieces of blockfront furniture (at 1/4 scale).<br />There are a few &quot;junk&quot; articles, of course, (for example, &quot;A Small Highboy&quot;) but there's not many in the collection.  If you have an interest in period furniture, this is an excellent resource.<br />If you're just getting started in woodworking, don't buy this book - you'll be lost.  But if you're reasonably proficient, this is an excellent book, especially if you're looking to improve your ability to build period furniture.  Highly recommended!	2004-04-01

I had never done crown molding before, so I had to figure out how to do it. This was especially challenging in the master suite which has cathedral ceilings and complex angles along the cathedral runs (pillars protruding into the room at different angles).<br />I did quite a bit of research to learn how to install crown molding and purchased several books on the subject. Wayne Drake's book &quot;Crown Molding and Trim&quot; was the ONLY book that addressed installation of crown molding in complex settings like cathedral ceilings.

Installing a piece of wood at an angle to the wall, when the wall itself goes at a number of different angles is not a simple or easy task.

Salisbury does not give any background so that a new reader can understand the political situation in China which led up to the Long March.  Additionally, Salisbury appears to be quite biased towards the Chinese Communists - according to him, Mao can do no wrong while he denigrates Chiang Kai-shek at every turn.  He completely ignores the logistics of the march and the effect it must have had on the peasants of the areas the communists went through.  According to his statistics, the communists began the march 80,000 strong, living off the land.  They claim to have expropriated food and other materials from \\"landlords\\" but they must also have taken grain and animals from the peasants in order to support their force.  This likely devastated the communities the march went through.<br />He also does not indicate how the communists replenished their arms and ammunition, since they couldn't get that from the landlords or peasants.  Military supplies must have been sent to the Chinese Communists from the Soviets but that issue is never even mentioned.  He also never explains why Chiang's vastly superior forces, which included air power, could not destroy the communists.<br />This book is mostly a paean to the communists - something that might have been written by the communists for a \\"Long March\\" reunion - not an unbiased history book.	2003-12-31

Eric Larson's book gave me the information to do the job.<br />I read the rest of the book and, although I did not use the data, the information seemed complete and the instructions were generally clear.  It's clear that Eric wrote the book for apprentice carpet installers and I applaud his textbook-like approach with the questions and answers after each chapter.  Based on the information contained and the approach used to teach it, I would give the book four to four and a half stars.<br />My complaint is about the editing, which is attributed to Dr. William G. Burns of San Antonio.  The English used in the book is atrocious.  Sentences and clauses run together without any punctuation, sort of the way someone would speak in informal speech.  Many of the sentences are just fragments, either without a verb or without a subject.  Possessive forms do not use an apostrophe (Jacks hammer instead of Jack's hammer).  It's clear that this book was written on a word processor and the spell check was used without any human judgment.  There are many places in the book where the wrong word is used, but not misspelled.  That is, \\"their\\" is used where it should be \\"there\\".  \\"To\\" is used when it should be \\"too\\".  \\"And\\" is used when it should be \\"an\\" (\\"three eights of and inch\\"). The book is riddled with errors of this nature.  My favorite is where Eric writes that \\"...the installer should asses the job...\\" instead of \\"assess\\".<br />I realize that Eric is a carpet installer and not an English major, and I do not fault him for the poor English usage.  I do fault him for not realizing his weakness and finding a better editor, even if that editor would drive him crazy with rewrites and markups.  There's simply no excuse for putting out a book, especially one that is to be used as a textbook, with such poor English usage.<br />However, if you can get past the mangling of the language, the book does have some good information on carpet installation.h usage.<br />However, if you can get past the mangling of the language, the book does have some good information on carpet installation.	2003-09-26

It's basically just a compendium of ways that food is preserved, written in a fairly uninteresting way.  It seems to just go on and on without any story or purpose.  Let me make a comparison to \\"Cod\\" by Kurlansky.  \\"Cod\\" tells the story of the New England fishing fleet and how preserved cod affected trade and the growth of US maritime strength.  \\"Cod\\" has a unifying theme which holds the reader's interest.<br />There's no story, theme, or technical depth to &quot;Pickled, Potted and Canned&quot;.  Within each section, it just repeats over and over the fact that certain foods were preserved with the subject of the section (drying, salt, sugar, etc.).  It doesn't discuss how the preserving material works to preserve the food, or how preserving fits into the flow of world history.  If you're interested in how preserving works, get \\"On Food and Cooking\\" by McGee.  It's not focused on preserving but you'll get more than in &quot;Pickled, Potted and Canned&quot;.  If you're interested in how the development of food preservation affected world history, I don't know what to recommend to you.  Maybe another reviewer can make a suggestion.	2002-10-25

Maor's book is a good description of where the number e comes from and its importance in modern engineering and mathematics.  The contents are accessible to anyone with a good high school mathematics education.<br />\\"An Imaginary Tale\\", however, does not fall into that same category.  The level of mathematics required to read and understand it is far beyond high school mathematics, probably requiring at least a BS degree in engineering, physics, or math.  It simply is not an easy book to read, nor is it very enjoyable because of the difficulty of the math.  Rather than making i accessible to a broad range of people, the book is targeted at people who probably already know a great deal of mathematics.  Nahim is preaching to the choir.<br />What's really needed is a book on complex numbers which is accessible to high school students who are planning to enter a university to study engineering, physics, or math.  Many graduating high school students simply do not have the background in complex numbers to understand engineering analysis and differential equations and need something which gives them the ability to visualize how imaginary numbers work.  Nahim's book, unfortunately, won't do that because a high school student simply could not understand it.<br />Hopefully, someone else will write a good introductory book on the imaginary number, perhaps even professor Maor, since he's demonstrated the ability to do so with e.  Until that time, unless you're a professional mathematician, pass on this book.	2001-11-12

The G.711 recommendation is probably 30+ years old and the US telephone companies have adhered to it since ratification.  In fact, G.711 simply confirmed what the US and European companies were already doing so the US telephone companies were using 64Kbps for voice even before G.711.<br />2.  Packet switching has nothing (or very little) to do with voice.  Voice is carried via circuit switched channels.<br />3.  When voice is carried via a digital channel in the US (at 64Kbps, I might add), one form of signaling \\"steals\\" the low order bit of an 8 bit voice sample of each sixth sample of the 24 channels on a DS-1 (AKA T-1) circuit.  Because of this, a data channel carried over one of these 64Kbps channels is only able to provide 56Kbps.  Maybe this is where Hecht went wrong.<br />But don't buy or not buy Hecht's book based on this one error (in the big scheme of things it's fairly small).  The real problem with the book is that it just doesn't do a jood job of explaining optical communications.  A better defense of Hecht's book might be that Hecht was attempting to write about all of the uses of optical fiber and not just communications.	2001-07-02

There's a real need for a book that explains the concepts of SONET/SDH in terms that a beginner can understand.  Unfortunately, this book doesn't meet that goal.<br />While &quot;SONET&quot; is a big book, 675 pages, only a small part is devoted to explaining how SONET works, from page 162 to 276, or slightly more than 100 pages.  The rest is just filler.<br />And even then, there are serious errors in the material, most importantly in the section explaining how pointers work.  On page 274, figure 8.19, he shows how a pointer adjustment is done.  However, he shows the New Data Flag (NDF, although it's labeled DNF in the diagram) being used with the &quot;I&quot; or &quot;D&quot; bits to adjust the pointer value.  Not correct.  The &quot;I&quot; or &quot;D&quot; bits OR the NDF are used, but not both at the same time.<br />On page 223, he describes asynchronous mapping and says that the DS-1 framing bits are not transported.  Wrong again.  In fact, in asynchronous mapping the SONET equipment simply looks at the DS-1 as a stream of bits and does not attempt to determine what the bits represent.<br />Now, this is the second edition of the book.  You'd think that these errors would have been caught by now, especially in the very important area of pointers (which most people have difficulty understanding the first time).<br />He also gives very little attention to the details of virtual tributaries (his explanation runs from page 209 to page 229).  Now, I realize that this is a difficult area to explain but that's what people buy a big book like this for.  Goralski would have done well to devote more of the book to a detailed explanation of how SONET works, complete with diagrams, rather than just 100+ pages.<br />I wish I could point you at a good introductory book on SONET/SDH but I still haven't found one yet.  There must be a technical author out there who can produce a good primer on SONET.  One is certainly needed.	2001-02-16

It lists two technical reviewers (Curtis Newton and Kevin Sparks) and the author thanks certain anonymous reviewers, I assume, in addition to Newton and Sparks.  And yet, the book has an amazing number of errors, even to my quick reading.  For example, on page 4 he credits Shannon as developing the criteria that you must sample at twice the bandwidth of interest, when this is generally credited to Nyquist (even Shannon credits Nyquist).  On page 10, he claims that 2B1Q is limited to 392 Kbps, when 2B1Q is used on HDSL to provision T1 lines at 1.544 Mbps over two pair (about 784 Kbps over each pair).  Extensions to the standard by companies such as Conexant have pushed 2B1Q to about 2.046 Mbps on a single pair.  Also on page 10, he associates \\"frequency hopping\\" with DMT, instead of wireless spread spectrum.  He also claims that CAP modulation can only achieve data rates of 10-175 Kbps.  I'm sure the engineers at Globespan will get a chuckle out of that.  On page 66, there's an error in Figure 8.9.  On pages 55, 56, and 57, his explanation of pointer adjustments has an error on when the pointer is adjusted.  And that's just with a quick review (maybe 30 minutes).<br />But perhaps more importantly, his explanation of SONET/SDH is just not very thorough or clear.<br />Unfortunately, I can't point you at a good book on SONET/SDH.  All of the books I looked at just don't do a good job of explaining it.  If you already know the technology you can read the books and understand them, but if you're just starting out you'll get lost in a hurry.<br />For a good explanation of the network, in general, the best book I've found is Bellamy's \\"Digital Telephony,\\" 3rd edition.  His explanation of SONET, while accurate, is too brief for a novice, however.	2001-01-23

He describes how many meals he and his kitchen staff put out, and  how he cheated at the Culinary Institute of America (CIA), but never even  mentions a desire to create unforgettable food.  The only mention of why he  chose to become a cook has nothing to do with food, but perhaps with power.<br />The second is the lack of mention of his parents (they appear briefly  in an early chapter).  But it's clear that their support was important to  Bourdain, both for the education funds he diverted to drugs and for his  tuition at the CIA.  Yet he never mentions them, giving the impression that  he did everything on his own.<br />Bourdain obviously is driven and works  extremely hard.  One is left wondering what he could have achieved, even in  the cooking world, if he had focused that drive and energy towards  achievement instead of drugs and macho posturing.<br />A book with a more  realistic view of the cooking world is Michael Ruhlman's &quot;The Making  of a Chef&quot;.  Save yourself some time and money and buy that one first.  And if you're really interested in cooking, get Harold McGee's book \\"On  Food and Cooking\\".	2000-08-04

Othonos and Kalli cover just about everything you would want to know about fiber Bragg gratings, from the physics of the fiber itself and how the  gratings are created, to applications (including some of the more exotic  ones). The material is presented in an understandable manner, with  sufficient text descriptions - not just equations that you have to figure  out yourself. If you're just beginning to learn about fiber Bragg gratings,  I recommend this book highly.	2000-07-04

In addition to reading the papers from ANSI T1X1 and the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF), I purchased  several books on the subject, including Siller and Shafi's  &quot;SONET/SDH,&quot; Goralski's &quot;SONET&quot; and Laches' &quot;Fiber  Optic Communications&quot;.  Ramaswami and Sivarajan's book &quot;Optical  Networks&quot; is definitely the best of the group.  &quot;SONET/SDH&quot;  gives a good overview, but you need to already know something about SONET  in order to understand it.  Goralski's &quot;SONET&quot; is too basic,  while &quot;Fiber Optic Communications&quot; is too theoretical.  &quot;Optical Networks&quot; is &quot;just right&quot; (to quote a famous  young lady's comments about a baby bear's porridge).  Whenever I need to  know something about optical networks, this is the book I turn to.  The  only problem is that the field of optical networks is moving quite fast  right now and this book provides a snapshot of the 1997-1998 timeframe.  I  wish the authors would put up a web site discussing some of the recent  activity in the field, but I suppose it's a bit much to ask them to devote  their lives to the book. All in all, if you want an excellent introduction  to optical networks, this is the book for you.	2000-06-27

It simply does not grab your attention and carry you forward like Le Carre's earlier books did. You get  sidetracked by the detail, which does not add anything to the story line.  I wound up attempting to skim the most egregious parts because they were so  boring. This book could have used a strong editor to force Le Carre to  re-write and focus the story line.  If you loved Le Carre's spy stories,  you're going to be very disappointed with this attempt.  I sure hope his  next book is better.	2000-05-27

Everything of  value in this book might make a short article in a magazine - expanding it  into a book makes it mind numbing. Unless you have an extremely high  tolerance for reading the same thing over and over, pass on this book.	1999-10-15
US	52707967	R2VDUHRDBARLVS	0553104624	253928041	Working with Emotional Intelligence	Books	1	99	105	N	N	A potboiler followup to his original book on emotional intel	This book was extremely disappointing. I read Goleman's original book on emotional intelligence and found it interesting. I purchased this book based on its title about working with emotional intelligence. I expected some guidance about how to work with people (employees) to improve aspects  of their emotional intelligence. For example, how to help a person who is  weak in self-confidence. This book, however, simply repeats the same thing  over and over - company A instituted some training in emotional  intelligence and it really helped them. Then, company B instituted some  training ... Just like politics, helping people is 'local' or  person-to-person. It appears that Goleman's answer to problems that people  have is 'hire people who don't have those problems.' This book seems to be  an attempt to profit from the success of his first book when he has nothing  more to say.	1999-04-12
