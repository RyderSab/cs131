I agree with the previous reviewer that this book is very much based in personal experience but, having grown up gifted in a different country, this gave me a real idea of what my son might face in the US. She covers the research and history of psychological theory regarding giftedness very well and I found the notes on Cherie (her daughter) as well as her own past to be very interesting. I'm terrified that my child will be a 'nerd' and left out in school and this book gave me some idea of how it might be possible to stand up for him and teach him to stand up for himself. A very personal opinion but I found it worth the read.	2005-06-20

I have been knitting for over 10 years and yet the hints and format of this book is probably the best I have ever laid my hands on. The split page format was strange to me at first but once I was actually working the patterns I realised how useful it was to actually be able to flip to the technique section while still seeing the pattern. Also, everytime the patterns asks for a change in technique it has a small side note telling you which page detailed instructions can be found. So, while the pages might be compromised over the years,(I'm not big on spiral bound books) the patterns and usefullness of the book are worth it. I know I am buying my own copy asap!	2004-10-05

The patterns are fascinating and so full of character. If you like Fair Isle this is a must to have a look at! I made a wool hat for a toddler from the book and there began my frustration. The book is a translation from Norwegian and uses Norwegian yarn without providing yarn equivalents or any of the standard names (dk, aran wool, worsted weight, etc). Gauge and needle size are provided but unless you know a bit about knitting its a bit of a chore figuring out which yarn you need. I ended up fiddling with the size of the needle to adjust to the pattern gauge and, while utterly pleased with the result, do wish that a neat little yarn conversion page had been added by the publisher!	2004-09-07

I read The Lady's Tutor by the same author before getting this novel and have to say that the writer has improved much with time. Awaken my Love is her debut novel and is a Time Travel / paranormal romance which showed a lot of promise in the beginning but left too many loose ends. Elaine, waking up in beautiful Morrigan's body, is way too intimidated by everyoe. Although the possibility of being committed to an insane asylum loomed large to influence her actions, she didn't show much spine for a large part of the novel. Charles at times seemed really attractive as a hero and at other times just too much like a nutcase himself . . . shooting between romancing his wife to insulting her! And did he ever figure out anything was wrong, considering that Elaine for a few pages was so very convinced that he did?? The erotica is good and this is what Schone is noted for in her later works. The humor is good but as a time travel it did fall a bit short. In that area it is still hats off to Karen Marie Moning but where it comes to her later erotic romances Schone leaves other authors behind in the dust!!	2004-01-22

This gorgeous oversized hardcover (yes amazon has the wrong picture . . .) first gave me the impression that the authors' priority would be pretty pictures and recipes would come second. I was very pleased to find that I was wrong. The book has lovely and accurate recipes for everything an Indian Kitchen should have including how to make panner (indian home made cheese) chenna (cheese used to make desserts) yoghurt, obscure indian vegetables and the main staple recipes of most indian cookbooks. I do have two complaints - the recipes are given without possible western substitutions for indian ingredients . . E.G wrapping things in bananna leaves and cooking them. Sounds great but my indian store doesn't tend to carry bananna leaves. Would foil work?? I don't know. It usually helps if a recipe is tweaked to accomodate a western supermarket. Julie Sahni's book Savoring India does that wonderfully.<br />Also, ocassionally there are fold out pages with little blurbs and pictures of things like street foods or snacks without a recipe for them. Nice to see but no way to cook them is provided.<br />I would also like to make a comment about the growing size of the cookbooks nowadays. I hated the teensy weensy pocket paperbacks but these huge SUV's of the kitchen take up the entire counter space above a cabinet and are way to long and heavy for a standard cook book holder. about six inches shorter would have worked fine although some of the pretty decor would have had to go.<br />All in all, a nice book for indian cooking	2004-01-20

Her writing style seems to have improved tremendously and in some scenes you practically feel like you are there. Well done detailing. The elements of the Sting operation were new and unusual in a Regency. Nice touch. I have to agree with the other reviewers though that Stuart was a bit of an anomaly.

This book is great . . .if you are a beginner at the book selling business.

I dont sell on Amazon (although I love shopping here) and Mr Windwalkers biased coverage of Amazon had me skipping huge chunks of the book. Ok Maybe he really feels that this is the most profitable place to sell but this book felt like a lightly veiled sales pitch! Amazon should give it free to everyone who joins Marketplace!<br />There is some good info here about online resources but there's nothing that you couldnt find yourself with a halfway decent knowledge of the web and search engines. And if you dont have that kind of knowledge you are going to need a lot more than this book to get you started selling books online. By the way. I really hated the promotion of the shipping supply stores.

The recipes are infallible and instructions clear. Unlike some of the other indian cookbooks (madhur Jaffrey for example who I do adore) it doesnt have an ingredient list a mile long for each dish. And, best of all, it has some of the recipes you never find in an indian cookbook written for people abroad; the food sold in the street vendor stalls, the dozens of different types of dal depending on the state you come from, pickle recipes and lovely chapters of history, culture, etc. There are also little blurbs about indian customs and traditions scattered throughout the book and it ends up being my favorite kind of cookbook, the ones you can read for an hour even if you arent planning to cook.	2002-09-06

This has always been one of my favorite Heyer novels and I am so glad it is finally being reprinted in the US. I first read this book in India of all places and got my own copy in London. If you like witty dialogue, situations and tons and tons of british humor this is a must for you. It seems deceptively simple, Young girl running away disguised as a boy, hitches up with cynical but gorgeous hero .. . In the hands of Georgette Heyer it will have you laughing out loud and absolutely unable to put it down until its done!	2002-09-06

Snobbish aristrocat falls in love with cloddish farmer.  . .sounds like a tried and true formula but in Saunders' hands it is magic. I loved the book and sat and read it in a day! I do hope that there will be sequels to this book i.e the stories of the other brothers. I agree with the other reviewer - daniel and Polly just dont go and Daniel deserved a book of his own. do read it if you like well written romance (along with some nice steamy scenes).	2002-07-03

R.K.Narayan is surely one of the giants of Indian fiction!	2001-06-29

This book-tape set has to be one of the best books on tape that rabbit ears has produced. Jack Nicholson's smooth magical voice is just perfect with predictably great music from Bobby McFerrin. A must for every child's  library!	2000-03-29
US	52702539	R1QH5B1L2FQRSH	0684803836	135128417	The Great Curries of India	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A must for Indian food fanatics!	I am of Indian descent and it is finally in Ms. Panjabi's book that I have been able to discover the detailed information on spices that usually passes from an Indian mother to her daughter. The recipies are marvellous  and you can effortlessly reproduce some of the most popular curries in  India. But the best part of the book for me was the explanation of the  different flavors and colors that one can achieve from combinations of  spices and even from different techniques of preparing the same spice. For  someone totally flabbergasted by the different results american spices give  in Indian recipies this book is a godsend!  Another welcome plus to the  book is the list of wines that can go with each curry. If you love Indian  food this book is a must!	1999-01-20
