In spite of the overly hyped nature of what is being written about, the method of so called &#8216;Mind Mapping&#8217; is fair enough, in the sense that it will encourage people having difficulties with traditional note taking and making, to be less intimidated by these tasks. Beyond that, it seems to be a promotional vehicle for sundry support products, etc. <br /> <br />&#8216;Mind Mapping&#8217; is, for the most part,  a personalised and graphical means of conveying the Gestalt and related keywords for what you want to remember or present, but is not really an effective way to convey this to others, in the way that a more traditional flow-chart or hierarchical headings structure would be capable of, to another reader, or a computer database. In that event, the Mind Map quickly becomes very similar to traditional methods. <br /> <br />Some claims have been made about the more traditional methods of note taking and making in comparison to Mind Maps, which are claimed to be vastly superior, for those having problems with the traditional way of doing things. I think this is more to do with poor note taking and making procedures, and cannot be taken as legitimate for all cases, as this book endeavours to substantiate, with its unfortunate tendency towards outdated science and pseudo-science.  There is also a sense that this book is like too much of what passes for educational &#8216;must-haves&#8217; in case your child is left behind. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, this book is sufficiently inexpensive to be worthwhile to get a start with, but should not be taken as a silver bullet for all one&#8217;s difficulties.         <br />	2005-09-22

Flynn exposes the totally unprincipled character of FDR and how his simple need for election victory plunged America and the rest of world, post-world war two, into a black hole of tyranny and Fascism from which it has yet to emerge.<br /><br />The consequences of this can be easily seen today in the legislation of Sarbane-Oxley, and  the plight of the post-hurricane-katrina underclass, as they find themselves too poor to escape the ravages of nature in spite of endless and massive government spending in their States, which is mostly geared to helping shore up the political advantage of an Oligarchy and its insidious bureaucracy. And we have wars being waged across the globe by unprincipled democrats in the name of unprincipled democracy, and with no valid outcome in sight, as they try to flog that Trojan horse of a U.N. into doing another lap or two, but without Joseph Stalin as its jockey.<br /><br />The most obvious criticism about this book, is that it would have benefited from a touch of editing to avoid a tendency toward repetition and long-windedness. But its content is irrefutable and is in stark contrast to the propaganda which still persists about the value of FDR&#8217;s reign of unprincipled incompetence.<br /><br />I also thought this book bore a strong underlying resemblance to the theme of Ayn Rand&#8217;s  &#8216;Atlas Shrugged.&#8217;	2005-09-17

This is the first book by Jeffrey Deaver that I have read, and was very surprised at how good it was. It&#8217;s a bit weak in its prose on occasion, and some of the technical details are  less than convincing, they being bent somewhat to fit the plot. But that shouldn&#8217;t be a problem for most readers. I liked the reference to&#8217;Walnut Creek&#8217; home of the besneakered FreeBSD Daemon. <br /> <br />I also thought the plot was slightly too overburdened with subplots, for the sake of it. But the parts did have a reinforcing aspect to the overall theme, so this is probably a matter of taste. I would usually prefer more expositional dialogue and greater focus on  fewer characters to beef up the characterisation, but, yet again, I didn&#8217;t feel there to be any significant lack in this aspect. <br /> <br />Ooops.... I almost broke my &#8216;e&#8217; key whilst keyboarding with my remarkably muscular fingers with their overly calloused fingertips, on this FreeBSD 5.4 box, that&#8217;s just the hottest machine for hacking, too :-) <br />	2005-08-10

United under an impossible overburden of socialist-gangsterism supported  by pension fund money invested in slave labour in the Far East and its substantial investments in the envious Americans&#8217; stock market. This is how the old-colonialists currently manage to have a social welfare system. But, as is the case in Germany and France, and to a great extent in the UK, this is  now creaking at the seams. <br /> <br />The highly educated and technically orientated youth are moving to America to benefit from their skills, since staying Europe is simply submitting themselves to a life in which their wealth is drained away to fund an endless expansion of bureaucracy and constraints. Until Europe unites under a Capitalist model in which the  bureaucracy is mostly banished from the political landscape it is a union of rats on a sinking ship. <br /> <br />Tom Reid&#8217;s book is briskly written and covers a lot of ground. But his enthusiasm for the current state of unity in Europe and its superficial benefits is akin to someone looking at the greener grass on the other side of the fence.      <br />	2005-07-31

In spite of the her mastery of seamless metaphor, pithy wit and clever turn of phrase, it has be concluded by page 43: this book needs a huge amount of editing and structural modification to make it a satisfactory read, from anybody&#8217;s point-of-view.  It&#8217;s just so unnecessarily and relentlessly repetitive.  <br /> <br />Farther on, many of the jump-cuts simply don&#8217;t make sense with respect to their purpose. And there are too many occasions in which the elegance of her language is abandoned for a dead straight statement, about Herman&#8217;s or Michael&#8217;s conduct. And it would have been a lot better to refer to &#8216;the woman&#8217; as Gerti and the Direktor as Herman, throughout. <br /> <br />Some commentators make the erroneous assertion that this is an indictment of Capitalism. This is not true. It is an indictment of gangsterism and the inability of those under such a tyrannical regime to progress towards Capitalism. <br /> <br />Nobel Prize Winner Elfriede Jelinek is obviously a very talented writer. But Lust does not do her talents any favours.  Despite that, it deserves a high mark for skillful prose.   <br />	2005-07-28

This a nicely packaged book with excellent illustrations by Geoff Taylor. The prose style is tidy and the plot pretty much follows a balanced four act story form to keep it moving along. So far, so good.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the so called research must have taken up no more than a lunchtime at the local Library, and even at that, the whole thing would be consistent with any preindustrial era, native culture. Simply take out any use of metals, add a good dollop of rampant mysticism, and you'd be there today. <br /> <br />The dialogue is too developed for such a long-ago period and the terminology is hardly credible, and sometimes derisory: World Spirit, and Soul Eaters ( was this not in Harry Potter?), for example. <br /> <br />Although young teens, with hardly any reading experience, would find this book pleasant enough reading, it strikes me as being an utterly cynical exercise to cash in on the popularity of other recently published books of this type. As is Ridley Scott's interest from the perspective of making a film. <br /> <br />A more intelligent choice would be books by C.J.Cherryh, and Fritz Leiber.	2005-02-15

Apart from this annoying factor, I did find the rest of the book reasonable enough, since I&#8217;m not really much of an FZ fan.  <br /> <br />The more fervent fen however, will find the book disappointing because its not particularly detailed, and is more of a schematic overview/tittle-tattle of FZ&#8217;s career and influences.

If you are looking for a good Fantasy story for the kids this Christmas, you would do very well in choosing The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. Mostly, this is because of the way in which details are presented and built into the proceedings in a clever yet uncomplicated fashion, which adds a lot of variety to the reading experience.<br /><br />The start of the book is somewhat simplistic because of the writing style, but this passes after the first couple of chapters, and develops into writing as sophisticated as the best of those writing Fantasy today. And it is surprising how much of the book is used by others for their own creations.<br /><br />The Hobbit is also a good choice for those intending to read the Lord of the Rings, since Ganadalf and Bilbo feature extensively in both books.	2004-12-14

The quality of this book's prose was very accomplished and the general subject matter was interesting with regard to book-binding and forgeries. I can't say that the plot was entirely convincing because their was no particularly strong reason for Corso to not simply hand over the chapter he got from LaPonte, and he could easily have stolen the `The Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows' from Fargas, himself, or Balkan could have done so, too, since he killed Fargas for it anyway.    I found the line drawings/engravings good to look at.     The film adaptation `The Ninth Gate, was a surprisingly good one, but it too had a few plot flaws.

After spending a fair bit of time with FreeBSD  and needing some information regarding Linux installations I thought this book would be a good way to speed things along. Wrong. It's not that this book is too expensive, or poorly put together, but it's little more than a cursory overview of the Linux operating system and a listing of the commands to get things done with a terminal. But even to find the commands to do simple things such as renaming files, is too time consuming to be bothered with. Simply doing a Google for the stuff you want to know is much quicker and more comprehensive.<br />Whole chapters are committed to such stuff as Emacs and KDE. But, yet again, there are specific websites with  HTML help manuals for this, and more. <br />These Open Source books are pretty much a waste of paper, simply because, being Open Source, it's all available online, or in the manuals provided with the distros.	2004-07-16

This sequel to Altered Carbon reads more agreeably, but is still too dependent upon the deployment of action and [love] scenes simply for the sake of it. The tail end of the book could have done with less dialogue and more narrative to balance it up. And there is still a credibility gap with respect to terminology and nomenclature, which seems out of place in a 26th century future context. <br />Some attempt is made to imbue matters with a greater degree of political and motivational development than in Altered Carbon, but not as much as I would have preferred.<br />I am still irked by the fairly obvious influences, in this case: Forbidden Planet, and the shadow creatures from Babylon 5, to name a couple. This is also an issue with other writers, whose apparently novel inclusions can turn out not to be, if one reads widely enough.<br />Richard Morgan is a very good writer, but like other very good writers, he needs something significantly fresher than this to be getting on with.	2003-11-03

For 'the-well-read-man' there is nothing new in this book, most of it being derived from Iain M Banks': Use of Weapons, Against a Dark Background, and Look to Windward; a smattering of William Gibson's: Neuromancer; and some of K. W. Jeter's work - probably Noir. A great deal of the book is concerned with scenes of gratuitous violence, containing just enough material to maintain a thread to the overall narrative. <br />The plot is a basic Raymond Chandleresque romp, which serves to imbue the characters with some motivation... <br />Richard Morgan's prose is unusually good for a British author, comparable to the better US writers such as K. W. Jeter, and devoid of the flowery and redundant elements that mars many of his contemporaries. It's unfortunate that the logical elements of this book aren't as well considered. The most obvious failing was Reileen Kawahara not figuring on the virus she supplied to Takeshi Kovacs being turned on herself, as it subsequently, and conveniently was. <br />There was too little background to the history of the cortical-stack, robbing the story of useful technical details, which would have been more insightful than the Catholic church coming in for some stick - yet again. Another failing was any substantial insight as to why being un-sleeved for a length of judicial-time was of consequence, since the impression was given that unless you were being tortured / interrogated in virtual, you were more or less unconscious for the period. The only significant aspect to any punishment being that you would probably end up in someone else's body or a synthetic of dubious quality. <br />Alternate Carbon is a reasonable book. But is too derivative for 2003. More effort could have been made to make it a more plausibly coherent and interesting read, at least, and with more interesting and convincing nomenclature and associated technology for the twenty-sixth century.	2003-11-02

I found Noam's writing style to be clear and plainly delivered, and thought his definition of terrorism was pretty accurate. The rest of the book is really a re-hash of details already available in many others, but since so many others quote Noam, it's hard to know who's re-hashing whom.<br />Like the other books of this type, the main failing is to address the issue of what is to be done to improve matters, so that the `bewildered herd' can make a significant impact for their own benefit. It is presumed that some heroic figure or figures will take heed of all the problems and assume the mantle of responsibility to make it all better. Why should they? After all, if the bewildered insist in adopting a gimme gimme herd mentality there's not much beyond business as usual.<br />Until such times as Noam and his associates are prepared to write about how things as they are currently, are to be changed, without creating yet another propaganda machine to keep it all in check, he and they are simply throwing stones at the windows, and the herd will remain diverted by their unreal, `Reality TV'.<br />Those interested  in such a development should give the Ayn Rand school of thinking a look see, until Noam, etc., get it together.	2003-11-01

It has some deadwood to be sure, but is sufficiently interesting to keep it afloat. <br />I was disappointed by Mike being taken in by the Sinn Fein propaganda machine on his trip to Belfast, his confusing Gangsterism with Capitalism, and his support of the French, since they get all that they want from their American foreign investments that allow involvement in the Iraqi contracts they were supposedly barred from. He also failed to point out that countries - such as the UK and Germany, etc. - can afford the welfare states they have, because of similar foreign investments. So, like the IRA, the old colonialists ... haven't gone away, you know.<br />A few chapters were little more than filler, where I would have preferred more elaboration of some the interesting points he does make. It's as if he's having to keep the whole thing zinging along to allow for the attention deficit of his audience, as if they are akin to the Stupid White Men he previously wrote about. Where's the Beef, Mike?<br />On a more positive note, it will be interesting to see if the book and its associated websites will motivate a significant number of Americans to get off their whining butts and go exercise the rights their founding fathers constituted, and be active in their REASONED choice of political representation that goes beyond the flawed nature of the libertarians, the rabidly dogmatic Republicans, and the spineless Democrats. <br />And the Greenies aren't the answer either.<br />Much is made about the evil corporate rip off brigade. This is true enough, but such people would do a lot less damage if the investors would exercise some sense, and not let themselves be suckered into the investments in the first place. Temptation can be hard to resist in an escalating stock market, but if a company such as Enron is inexplicably ahead of the curve, it's probably a scam. Like choosing politicians, reason must prevail to avoid disappointment.	2003-10-21

Where are all the Wizards that make life easier in Microsoft, being the most obvious difference. <br />This book by Greg Lehey is very helpful as a guide to keep going. It points out the differences between the Microsoft way of naming files and the difference in the command line conventions that a DOS user, for example, would be familiar with. The rest of the book is comprehensive enough by the look of it. With any details remaining, resolvable with a little bit of perseverance ( not that I am much of a power user, as yet). The issue of which type of desktop is discussed, with some pointers on how to modify their operation. How to accommodate files specific to Windows and Linux, etc.<br />My experience with Microsoft Windows at the NT, 2000PRO and XP-PRO levels has been good. But the reason for looking at FreeBSD Unix was to get around having to keep up with the huge differences in the way each new deployment of a Microsoft system requires. My expectation is that having learned the way of working with Unix the once. It will not be too much different as the OS is updated. <br />Except for very specific instances, users new to FreeBSD, would do well to consider running the software on a decent machine, and not some old redundant machine. This will let them try out much more of what is available on the distribution packages, and with much speedier results. In my case the simplest option was to buy a hard drive rack and a couple of trays, which allows me - at this stage - to experiment with FreeBSD Unix and easily swap back to Windows, or Linux, etc without having the place coming down with odds and ends of computers.<br />The Complete FreeBSD should suit those getting off the ground with its clear and amicable delivery.	2003-09-13

But their daughter, Lucy, has other ideas, becoming the victim of her failed plan to delay the family's departure and a possible change of heart. The years that follow leave Lucy guilt ridden about her parents' departure without her, they thinking she has perished at sea, etc.  <br />The most attractive quality of this book is William Trevor's cool and efficient prose when it comes to describing scenes, he always choosing the right word to convey the attributes about what he is describing.  Unfortunately, he applies this brevity to the story as a whole, which, allied to an omniscient and mixed viewpoint style, robs the characters of any substance beyond idle chit-chat dialogue. <br />The bulk of Lucy's story could have been more effectively rooted in Lucy's point-of-view, with the bulk of it being conveyed as compressed back-story. This would have made more sense. The Captain and his wife's details after leaving Ireland could have been expressed as dialogue between the Captain and Lucy and the Captain and Mr Sullivan, etc. on the Captain's return, for all there really was of it.<br />In other words, the objective story was too schematically presented to hold one's attention particularly well, and the subjective story was even more so, to the point of being risible.<br />William Trevor is a skilful prose-writer, but the structural execution of what he has to tell, is sadly lacking in 'The Story of Lucy Gault'.	2003-09-04

The orphaned son of a British Army officer learns the way of the streets of India, where he acts as a courier, and sometimes  a spy, for locals who are in the pay of the British as spies, in their pursuit of the Great Game, in which the 19th century empires of Europe and Asia  vie for control of India - the jewel-in-the crown of the British Empire.<br />At the age of thirteen, Kim befriends a Lama who is seeking a mystical river. Kim  accompanies him on his search, and takes an important message to a British Officer regarding the nature of a white stallion's pedigree, which is really information about a tribal conspiracy. So Kim embarks upon an adventure which will lead him to his father's old regiment and his induction - after suitable testing - into the Great Game.<br />Not too much to do with the British Empire directly in terms of the Imperium and the underdog, the Indians with their tribal fiefdoms and a myriad of caste and religious divisions keeping the pot boiling well enough on their own. So there's not much jingoism evident.<br />I was struck by how much a couple of the characters resembled some of those by Fritz Leiber, and C.J. Cherryh. Kim was akin to Fritz Leiber's Gray Mouser. And the old woman in the carriage reminded me of Illisidi from C.J. Cherryh's Foreigner series.<BR> <BR>I found the quality of the writing suffered from very abrupt changes in events, which required a couple of re-reads of many sections to get the hang of what had just happened. The most literary section was the one describing Kim and the Lama's trek through the mountains in the end section. The rest was to a good standard, but would have benefited from a more point-of-view style to keep things on a more  even keel.	2003-07-25

What a great read this book is, with it's quality prose, credible characters, dry humor, and  seamless narrative, which is actually a story and not simply an exercise in stylish writing, as too many books such as this, often are. It was also good to see it all done in under two-hundred and fifty pages, instead of the more customary four-hundred page - and then some - behemoth.<br />My main bone of contention is the author's voice being too loud: her use of third person present tense omniscient viewpoint making the multiple character scenes rather muddy in their reading  This was also a problem when a character was reminiscing, the present tense viewpointing, distracting in such close proximity to past tense musings.<br />This execution does give an up-front punch to the prose, but it would all have read more agreeably as third person past tense, keeping the viewpoint tightly associated with the character. The benefit of this can sometimes be seen in sections where Oliver, for example, keeps his mind on track for a page or two at a time.	2003-07-20

On the minus side, the overall structure lets the book down, with too scant an integration of the background material and the main character, Bob Dollar, to such an extent, that Bob is pretty much superfluous. The Dutch windmill mechanic was more interesting and had more charisma than Bob.<br />Tying the background details and histrionics into Bob's point of view, would have been a much more satisfactory way to present the material, and would have made for a more satisfactory read, at least. <br />And the ending was too passé. <br />It's as if Annie Proulx is cashing in on her celebrity with something too slap-dash to be credible.	2003-07-05

The first section of this book tells the story of a terrorist agent / English professor  whose simple plan to detonate nuclear weapons with the aid of cellphone technology fails, and how the assassination of his daughter as revenge for his failure drives him to reveal his secret after the slaying of the man who got his daughter pregnant, and his own suicide.<br />The remaining two thirds of the book is the failed agent's story in the form of a masterful work of fiction, with the addition of pre-suicide notes. This is set up as an assemblage of paperwork discovered by the campus police officer who had been investigating the killing of the agent's daughter and the subsequent killing and suicide, and the college's English Department.<br />The quality of prose in this section was highly reminiscent of Alfred Bester's - Golem 100, Iain M Banks' - Use of Weapons, and Nicholson Baker's - The Fermata. So I would be keen to read more of James W. Mintz's work, when it becomes available, since writing of this quality is all too rare.	2003-05-25

As a normal user of the Library I was surprised at how much time, money, and inappropriate effort has been applied to the quest for a reduction in storage space and the reformatting of existing stock into unsuitable microfilm ( as the colour inserts demonstrate).<br />Much of the scare-mongering to do with he instability of acidic papers could have been more simply gotten around at the paper making stage, before too many years had gone by for it to become a motivational issue to dump library stock.<br /> On the other hand, because of the lack of choices and the ever increasing volume of publications demanding ever more storage, something had to give. And it's only now with the common use of electronic authoring and the availability of the .PDF format can publications become archived as digital files, without any significant problems in quality, either for simple text based publications, such as novels, or publications rich in text and image content.<br />Older, printed publications, such as the large format newspapers Nicholson Baker is archiving, are a problem, since capturing their content as images is the only way to realistically reformat their content into a digital form. The downside being the huge file sizes generated.<br />Many older works are being re-released in a digital format, but poor quality standards with respect to inaccuracies in the recovered text tends to cheapen the results. Text recovered by OCR, must be carefully read for errors that creep in.<br />That aside, digital storage is the way to go for future publications, both from a storage and distribution point of view.<br />As for newspapers, the introduction of rolling web-news is a good thing.<br />This book is full of interesting information, ranging from the use of Egyptian Mummies' wrappings to supplement the rag-paper industry of the 19th century, to library preservationists risking life and limb in de-acidification programmes in which the process is akin to playing with air-fuel bombs. Some streamlining of the contents would have beneficial: not because it tends toward a rant, but because it  tends to be a touch overly repetitious.<br />The most likely outcome will be that those with the inclination and the resources, such as John Warnock, Nicholson Baker, etc. will take it upon themselves to be the archivists of the historical record, with the possibility that such archives will have a future value to others who require the information (similar to television news companies who keep libraries of video footage to sell clips from ) any proceeds going into the non-profit organisation in order to help support it.	2003-05-11

Criticising this book would be almost heartless, since it mostly deals with examples of how he gang-of-two  - the U.S.A. and Britain - ride roughshod over everyone they can, to further their own interests. But if they weren't, the French, Germans, Russians, etc., would do so just as much, as they already try to do, and have done for centuries. <br />My criticism is two fold: Firstly, the U.S.A. is essentially the proxy-spearhead for the rest of the world's rulers and not entirely an imperialist entity in itself. Every other nation of significance is a shareholder in the U.S.A. and are direct benefactors of the association providing they can keep their own populous and independent spheres of influence in check. Which is why the U.S.A. is the HyperPower it is. <br />And secondly, without the conflict, John Pilger and his journalist and humanitarian- aid  colleagues would have little to write about or do. I don't know of too many that ever ran for government. Martin Bell ran as an independent against Neil Hamilton in the UK, but he didn't last for long.<br />The bottom line is: not enough people really care too much about those being stepped on, so long as they have something to gripe about and it doesn't interfere with Friends. And the rulers of the world know it.	2003-04-18

Simple and usable websites are an even bigger challenge, which is why too few exist.

Things in the science-fiction world haven't moved on much since 1895, with respect to Science Fiction and its love affair with time travel and the paradoxes thereof. I suppose this is because the Time Machine by H. G. Wells is very much a philosophical piece on the nature of man and abstracts to do with multidimensionality, more so than any technology to do with time travel.<br />I was surprised at some of the ideas put forward at the beginning of the book, one of which postulated that time could be a state of mind as much as anything. Something along the lines of Groundhog Day, with only a possible glimmer of memory as indication of what might be happening. A notion given a touch of reinforcement at the end of the book where the Time Traveller finds himself forgetting details of where he's been in the future because of the intrusion of his normal surroundings and associations. The white flowers given to him by Weena, acting as a mnemonic jolt.<br />This is more a novelette, than a novel. Even so, it does tend to get on its soapbox on occasion, instead of keeping a tidier eye on a few odds-and-ends details as would have been more appropriate.	2003-02-17

A year out from Alpha Station, Phoenix arrives in Reunion Station space, where the aliens - alluded to in the previous titles - are encountered. First contact, although basic, turns out to be much more fruitful than with those in charge of the station, who have their own, Guild agenda. To achieve this the Guild are prepared to withhold fuel, and take over Phoenix, if need be.<br />Bren Cameron and his associates have their agenda, too: They must rescue an alien who has been held captive on Reunion Station for six years and return him to his fellow aliens, as a possible goodwill bargaining chip for their safe passage back to Alpha. Recover, Sabin, the senior captain and her companions. Board Reunion Station's population. And get the fuel from the Guild.<br />It took a couple of chapters to get into CJC mode after a year of not reading any, since Defender. I was very impressed by how much more balanced the general writing quality is to the overall scheme of things, their being hardly any of the overt space-opera conventions that tended to - for me at any rate - make the subtlety and detail seem like elements that had to be justified. This also applies to the jacket blurb, which is more restrained than usual - and all the better for it.<br />It was also good to see some new details, such as: Jump Drugs not being required, and the alien's lift, which spun, to simulate gravity.<br />As usual, all the little details are used very effectively, especially some nice touches to do with Cajeiri's entertainments and experiments.	2002-11-15

Paul Argentini's Elements of Style covers the bulk of the details required for those who want to make up a decent screenplay consistent with accepted formatting standards.. It also covers stage plays. The creation of a screenplay template for word processors is discussed, but few details are given on how to do this. But - to be fair - this is different from version and vendor, so it's a minor point. Creating macros in Word 95 and 2000, for example, is a different procedure for each one, the 20000 version being less than obvious.<br />For the more ambitious student, I would recommend getting the Cole and Haag book. It's more comprehensive, explains the general background to screenplays, and has many examples of real screenplays, with worked exercises.	2002-09-07

The dialogue is very smooth; the more colourful prose (for most of the time) blends in with the overall prose style, instead of sticking out like a sore thumb; and the background information is integrated with the characters as the book progresses in an almost Point-of-View delivery.<br />At thirty percent longer than the Fountainhead this is long read - about 40 hours to keep up with the necessary detail - but is consistent with the quality of the structural elements of the story, and not overblown as others have suggested. Doubtless it could have been edited down to significantly less, but it didn't really seem necessary, since it all read smoothly, without any distracting slow sections. Some achievement, when most others can't mange this in books at a third of the length.<br />The book's general tone allied to somewhat supercharged and improbably articulate  main characters detracts from the book's literary merits. But with Atlas Shrugged  as a title, instead of  The Strike - as Ayn Rand had originally intended - it's pretty well in keeping. (Ayn Rand didn't figure on titles being too important provided they were consistent with the theme, but The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are more interesting than Mainspring or The Strike). I would have liked to have seen some attention to the naming of products, devices and legislation. Rearden Metal?... The Anti-Dog-Eat-Dog Bill?.... The Ferris Persuader?.... etc.  <br />At 55 pages the John Galt speech was long, but not as daunting to get through as I'd expected it to be, which, like the rest of the book, would have needed drastic surgery to make any significant inroads without having to leave anything out. Even so, I'm pretty sure that it could have been reduced - with care - to about two thirds of its length. <br />Because the speech is so long and intense it's like a conclusion to the book, but not, leaving the remaining 100 pages rather anticlimactic for a goodly proportion. This quality was amplified by some very weak writing with respect to the characters of Mr Thomson, and his cohorts, who came across too feebly; the attempt by Dr Stadler to take over Project X; and the rescuing of John Galt from the Institute of Science was so poorly and schematically executed, it was laughable, made more so by Dagny shooting a guard dead because his refusal to back down was the behaviour of less than an unthinking animal ( spot of elitism there, I thought). The post-speech section also, just about, cleared up a logical niggle about John Galt and Dagny Taggart:<br />After discovering the motor at the Starnes' Twentieth Century Motor Company, Dagny engages experts to find out how it might have worked. But getting nowhere fast, she approaches Dr Stadler to seek his help. Stadler refuses and cites his reasons and mentions his disappointment over three brilliant students he once taught. Dagny doesn't ask who these three were, and so doesn't discover that they were John Galt, Francisco d' Anconia, and Ragnar Danneskjold. She finds this out, much later, from Hugh Akston. So the point is... she could have made more rapid progress with the motor, and someone outside the chosen few knew who John Galt was. A problem such as this occurred in The Fountainhead where Dominique didn't wonder why and question Howard Roark about why he knew so much about marble, when he was working on her damaged fireplace, and saved herself a lot of wonderment.<br />It's as if Ayn Rand is selective about the logic she cares to attend to. This is also an issue regarding the philosophy of her books, which I agree with, but her philosophy is backed up by a tightly controlled paradigm. Any xyz-ism can be defended by the specifics chosen and how they are articulated. But that's another can of worms.<br />Anyway... I grasped the book in my hands. I opened it. I read it - and I liked it! <br />(And, by the way, there were no rape scenes in The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged).	2002-08-18

After downloading a few scripts from drew's scriptoroama, Basic Instinct, Fargo, Blade Runeer (the original Hampton Fancher version ), etc., I thought it would be a good idea to get familiar with what is recommended practice., since scripts tend to look pretty similar but with inconsistencies in some of the details.<br />Cole and Haag give plenty of clear advice, coupled with why the block elements and the inner details of a script are formatted and timed as they are. The section dealing with the setting up of a word processor to make the work easier was somewhat garbled, but the part for typewriter set up looked to be okay. <br />This is a book well worth having, so that you can format and structure your script to be as effective as possible, and to take care of the parts that script formatting applications such as Final Draft 6.0 or Screenwriter 2000 don't attend to.

Adobe make a lot of great software for which they can never tell anyone in a straightforward fashion how to use, except for a few well hidden bulletins that you might happen to chance upon on their web-site. To compound this problem they insist on creating their quite expensive `Classroom in a Book series, which, although nicely designed and printed on quality materials, don't really tell you much more than is already available in the application's Help Guide, which, if persevered with, makes the CIB issue a bit superfluous.<br />This book would be just about acceptable for Photoshop Elements, since it's an application not intended to be used in professional circumstances. Indesign 2.0, however, is, and is also pretty expensive. Okay you can quickly get the hang of the basics with some prior experience of PageMaker and the Help Guide, but this application really needs to be explained by someone such as Thomas Neuburger who did such a nice job for FrameMaker 6.0: an application that Indesign 2.0 is supposed to be head-to-head with. <br />Adobe really need to get a grip and desist from treating their high-end products as little more than glorified frivolities for customers with deep pockets. It makes for dissatisfaction, and a lack of any appreciation as to  how much better their products are in relation to less expensive alternatives, that only do basic things.	2002-07-25

Framemaker 6.0 is one of those applications whose fame precedes it, making one wish that they had it for all that nitty-gritty work that is such a horrible chore by other means. So you get it, and launch it, and are underwhelmed at a dishwater plain interface more in keeping with some kind of share-ware, and you wonder: `What is this about? Where's all those floating palettes that Adobe love to sprinkle across your screen? Why is a new document placed in that offset window with the zoom controls nicely hidden at its bottom edge ( z Z ), along with a pop-up menu to sort out the document pane? Have I been suckered out of some big bucks, and should have gotten that lovely, nice Indesign 2.0 instead?'   <br />So you have a quick root around and discover that it's not too dissimilar to the Word application you're familiar with, but knowing, because of all that fame that preceded it, that there must be a lot of useful stuff under the hood. The help guide is a help, but doesn't give you the big picture. Getting the `Classroom in a Book' is an option, but knowing,  from previous outings, that you won't get much beyond the help guide's contents, necessitating something a bit more substantial.<br />My choice was to go with the Thomas Neuburger option. And I didn't regret it. It's so plainly written, comprehensive, and understandable. A paradigm of explanation that Adobe would do well to abide by instead of their own ramblings. It's a comparatively  expensive book, but Framemaker 6.0 is an expensive application, which needs to be clearly explained to get the value out of it.	2002-07-12

Ayn Rand describes the necessary elements to take a theme abstraction and present it as a set of concretes directly related to the theme abstraction - the Romantic style. To help convey her reasoning she analyses examples from writers, herself included, who fit in, and some who don't. Victor Hugo and Isak Dinesen are two  examples that are consistent with her preferences. Sinclair Lewis and Thomas Wolfe being two that aren't. <br />When I reviewed, The Fountainhead, I stated that Ayn Rand had an unfortunate tendency to indulge in `eye poppingly bad' literary prose, which in this book she goes into great detail to point out its merits. Whilst her defence of these sections is logical, it still doesn't take away from their basic quality: they're still eye poppingly bad. As badly written as the pieces she has chosen from elsewhere to demonstrate how not to write. Unlike Victor Hugo's, and Isak Dinesen's, which is very smooth . When she writes more plainly, as she does for most of the time, her intention is conveyed perfectly well without any need for colourful and distracting prose. <br />That was the only real contradiction and failing of this book. Everything else is very appropriate for those who have the inclination and determination to write well in the Romantic style. <br />Her Non-fiction follow up is worth reading as a companion volume	2002-06-08

Many of us have been brought up on the idea that capitalism is a system which promotes the domination and exploitation of others by those in pursuit of personal gain. This is not capitalism, it is gangsterism. Capitalism is a philosophy which promotes the right of the free individual to trade with other free individuals without hindrance from the state. <br />To criticise this book in a negative way is difficult, since neither I nor anybody else has lived in a society based on capitalism. But I have lived in a capitalistic society within the bounds of the United Kingdom. My observation is that the parts of the United Kingdom that tend more towards capitalism are more successful and prosperous than those parts that are not: the southeast of England being the greatest exemplar. Taking a step further, the United States of America with its greater capitalistic tendencies, is demonstrably more successful and prosperous than the United Kingdom.<br />The clarity of the book is helped by the many examples provided by Ayn Rand and her contributors. Some of these are a bit historical for todays readers, and the piece on what a patent applies to has been superseded by the recent allowing of patents for discoveries relating to human and animal gene sequences. A few examples from recent and ongoing state activity would be as follows:              <br />Cuba is regarded by the IMF as the best example of a third world country doing comparatively well by first world standards. But Cuba doesnt have to be a third world country. Cuba has the human resources to compete perfectly well with the first world if the state were not in total control, as the enterprising Cubans who moved elsewhere have demonstrated.  <br />Zimbabwe has been reduced to a state of hopelessness and starvation because of  gangsterism promoted by the state. Even more developed countries like India and Pakistan are borderline cases because their states choose to fritter away in excess of a hundred million dollars a year fighting each over Kashmir, instead of promoting a way for their people to take part in capitalism, and so improve their circumstances. The Palestinian situation is another example where the lack of a capitalist philosophy is creating so much trouble, its leadership preferring to loot and mooch, and gallivant in luxury around the world instead of staying at home and sorting things out.<br />Where I come from, the economy is totally dependant on handouts from the British Government. This mean that anyone with sense and enterprise has to leave the province because the sources of start-up capital are too busy mooching from the gravy-train of government handouts and other sources of  handouts from Europe and the United States ( the international fund for Ireland and the peace process dividend to name two ). And the so called Celtic-Tiger isnt too far behind.<br />In England the travelling public and commerce are benefiting from the fiasco that was the piece-meal privatisation of the rail system. This mess has come home to roost with a vengeance, and all because the private operators were being relentlessly interfered with and have ended up as the whipping boy for the state, which should have kept its hands off and let the competitive process do its work. The only good thing, so far, is that Steven Byers, the current transport secretary, got his butt kicked by the City. <br />Not content with that the education system is to be partially privatised and interfered with. So again, the private part will take the fall for the state.  <br />And the Millennium Dome, what a mess that was. All they would have to have done was leave it be and run the thing as a leisure attraction under its in-place management for a couple more years. After all, the whole site has lain empty for that long, at a cost of a million pounds a month. But then the sate can afford to waste that kind of money, since its not theirs.<br />Capitalism, as defined in this book, would seem to offera better way forward than what is currently draining the life blood from the more civilised parts of the world.	2002-05-18

Howard Roark is an architect who dismisses the design practices of the past as a crutch for lesser architects and their impressionable clients. For Roark, form follows function, and there will be no compromise. No matter how hard pressed he is for money. Peter Keating, however, has no such qualms, and is perfectly comfortable with the old-school way of doing things. But he does know his limitations. These he circumvents by having Howard Roark redesign some of the more complicated commissions that come his way. <br />Years pass. Peter Keating rides the crest of a wave with the help of the boss' daughter, Dominique Francon. Howard Roark, on the other hand, struggles from one commission to another. One of them is a property scam which worked out for the better. Another lands him in court because of manipulation of a client by the newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey.<br />Dominique Francon, who had married Peter Keating, leaves and marries the media / property tycoon, Gail Wynand. Peter Keating's world begins to crumble, and  he finds himself begging the influential Ellsworth Toohey for a chance at the government's housing development project, Cortlandt Homes. Ellsworth Toohey invites him to try, well knowing that the chances of him succeeding in the bid are slight, since he suspects that Peter Keating hasn't designed everything he has claimed to.<br />So Peter Keating turns to Howard Roark, begging him to secretly design the project. His plea is accepted on the proviso that under no circumstances, whatsoever, is the design to be diverted from. Peter Keating agrees, signs a secret contract with Howard Roark, and has Ellsworth Toohey submit the design, which is accepted. The project is begun.<br />Returning from a yachting trip, with Dominique  and Gail Wynand, some months after the commencement of the project, it transpires that Peter Keating has been forced to acquiesce, mutilating the original design. None too surprised, Howard Roark decides to dynamite what has been constructed of the Cortlandt Homes project and take his chances in court....       <br />Read as a work of fiction, and not as a Trojan horse for the Rand Manifesto, my opinion is:<br />There is a lot of eye-poppingly bad and redundant literary prose, as unnecessary to the story as gargoyles and Athenian arches would be on a Howard Roark building.<br />The use of mixed viewpoint robs the reader of a more direct understanding as to why some of the characters have some of the extreme attitudes that they have. Having Dominique Francon issue streams of  almost incomprehensible dialogue to have someone else say  they don't have a clue what she's talking about is hardly the best way to involve the reader. <br />There are occasions when the logic is a bit skewed. For example, Dominique encounters Howard at her father's granite quarry and wonders what such a noble specimen of manhood is doing breaking ( unyielding ) rocks. She contrives a way to meet him at her home. The means she chooses is to damage a marble slab fronting the fireplace in her bedroom. Howard appears as instructed and lectures her on all the types of marble available and how it is vital that she obtain the correct grade. Dominique doesn't give any thought to how a rock-breaker would be so articulately knowledgeable on the subject of marble. And so she doesn't make any attempt to have her earlier wonderment answered. Details such as this are quite a common failing, its rectification  subordinated to the eye-poppingly bad prose.<br />Even so, The Fountainhead is obviously written by someone who is tremendously skilful at integrating a plethora of sub-elements; can create a sense of high drama; and can cut through the utter mush that prevails in the world today.	2002-05-13

This is a disappointing book from the man who brought us The Man with Two Brains, Dead Men don't Wear Plaid, The Jerk, etc. The characters have no point of view of their own, the narrator's - voiced like the wise-guy from My Blue Heaven - is relentlessly snide and smug. <br />The quality of the writing is further marred by a so-so third person, present tense which would have been better presented as simple third person, past tense. And the dreaded `which' was used to the point of tedium in place of some rephrasing to avoid the problem.<br />There is plenty of good humour in Shopgirl, but at the expense of some in-depth writing to have the book be more than a novelty exercise. I would suggest that Steve Martin go read some Nicholson Baker before he attempts another book of this type.	2002-05-03

Whilst playing a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy accidentally discovers a wintry world beyond a wardrobe full of fur coats. She meets the Faun, Mr Tumnus, who invites her back to his home where he entertains her and  explains about the world of Narnia, how it is controlled by an evil witch, and confesses that he has been kind to Lucy because he is under threat of dire punishment from the witch if he doesn't deliver any child of Eve or Adam who crosses his path. But Mr Tumnus takes a chance on the witch not finding out, and lets Lucy go back to her own world. Lucy tries to convince her three companions that she has been to Narnia, but hey all laugh.<br />A few days later they all find their way into Narnia and embark on an adventure to destroy the power of the witch and save Narnia from an eternal winter where Christmas never happens. <br />This was a book that I'd never read as a child and reading it as an adult the writing seems to be a bit too sketchy and rough around the edges. I don't know if this is of any relevance to the children reading this title, but it seems odd that C. S. Lewis' contemporary, J. R. R. Tolkien, made a significantly better job of The Hobbit. It was also interesting to compare C. S. Lewis' writing with Philip Pullman's Dark Materials series, since they are so much compared. Yes, Philip Pullman's writing is very similar, except for the minor ( but important ) detail that The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe is written in first person, avoiding the annoying viewpoint problem that Philip Pullman's work suffers from.	2002-05-01

Due to misuse of the Subtle knife by its creators and subsequent bearers, Dust is leaking from one world to another. And due to the abyss that was created from Lord Asriel's campaign against the Authority, all the worlds' Dust is in danger of passing into oblivion, destroying all conscious life. To stop this from happening, all of the windows, created with the Subtle Knife, in all the worlds, must be closed. <br />The lovers, Lyra and Will, reluctantly accept that this has to be, and that they will be parted from each other for the rest of their lives in their own worlds where they and their daemons can enjoy a long life. But, as a compromise, the window that was created from the world of the Dead into the world of the Mulefa can be left open so that, like the ghosts that Lyra and Will have set free, they, too, will someday be re-united.<br />There is quite a lot in the Amber Spyglass and its precursors to criticise. Mostly this would be to do with logical clarity and consistency from one book to the next, and the ever present misuse of mixed viewpoint. But would the nephews really notice these details. <br />Probably not. And this is because they would be unlikely to persevere with a set of titles that really need to be considered as one long twelve hundred page book in order to get a hang of the inter-relationships. Simply skimming the action highlights wouldn't be recommended, since many of the highlights are only relevant when a subtle tie in from somewhere else is applied. Skimming would mean that they would miss a lot of the story's goodness. Compounding the problem is the schematic quality of many of the techno-thoecratic details that are also slightly contradictory, which, to the more experienced eye gives the impression of window dressing, they being too vague to spend the time on to make satisfactory sense of.<br />All that aside, I did enjoy the three books overall. Philip Pullman's writing is very consistent in quality from the start of The Golden Compass to the end of The Amber Spyglass. But he could have spared the reader so much use of  `which'  and  `too'. And he should have spent more time on clarity and less on a cast of thousands.<br />The Dark Materials set is worth reading, but readers shouldn't beat themselves up about any misunderstanding of the inner detail.<br />As for the nephews, I'll be recommending J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and C. J. Cherryh's The Paladin and The Goblin Mirror.	2002-04-23

Lord Asriel has passed through to another world, with the intention of finishing a conflict that had been unsuccessfully fought before. This time, the good guys might win because of his passion and determination. But he is without a decisive weapon, which mustn't fall into the hands of the enemy.<br />Lyra has followed Lord Asriel and encounters a boy called Will, who has found a way, by chance, into this new world from a world almost the same as her home-world. She has the Alethiometer, and Will - by virtue of further happenstance - becomes the bearer of the Subtle Knife. The Subtle Knife is the decisive weapon that Lord Asriel requires to determine a victory, and it is up to Lyra and Will to deliver it to him.<br />And Lyra is important, too.<br />The Subtle Knife was a more agreeable read than The Golden Compass / Northern lights. This was mostly due to the longer sections that gave the various characters and associated events pages, instead of a couple of lines or a short paragraph to play out, in relation to the unfolding plot. Even so, Philip Pullman's use of mixed viewpoint in multi-character scenes is a distraction that robs the story of useful energy and quality of character association.<br />The endorsements compare Philip Pullman to J R R Tolkien, proclaiming him to be his successor in the pantheon of greatness. In terms of the story this isn't really an issue for debate, but Tolkien's  more skilful writing, with respect to maintenance of viewpoint, means that Philip Pullman has a little way to go. This subtle and decisive weapon should be less difficult to obtain.<br />Next up...  The Amber Spyglass.	2002-04-18

By way of a spying expedition Lyra overhears her uncle ( her father actually ), Lord Asriel, address a group of scholars about a strange phenomenon  in the northern wastelands. Shortly afterwards her kitchen-boy friend Roger and a few others are  kidnapped by a group of child snatchers. Lyra almost meets the same fate, but is rescued by a group of concerned Gyptians who are the parents of some of the disappeared. Equipped with an Alethiometer - an instrument that can reveal future and past events.. and more - Lyra embarks upon rescue mission.  <br />I was asked by my pre-teen nephews what I thought of Philip Pullman's Dark Materials books. I told them that I didn't know, and wasn't too keen on finding out after soldiering through the tiresome Harry Potter quartet. Then a short documentary appeared on the BBC a couple of months later featuring Philip Pullman and a focus on the Dark Materials books... it didn't look too promising. But my curiosity was piqued. So I bought the troika and started with The Golden Compass / Northern Lights to see how it would go.<br />Your attention is immediately drawn to the gushing accolades on the cover and first group of pages by people who have won prizes and are - in many cases - professional magazine or book publishers / editors, making a reasonable person assume that there is indeed a rich harvest to be reaped from the narrative within. And, to a reasonable degree, you won't be disappointed. <br />Unfortunately this book really ambles along, with an occasional burst of energy that saves it from being gracefully retired. Some of the reasons for this are as follows:<br />Lyra and her daemon, Pantaliamon, are suddenly introduced in the first page with no indication as to what a daemon is. And a contradiction is suggested as to why Lyra's daemon and the servant's daemon aren't aware of each other and so give Lyra away as she and Pantaliamon hide from the servant's normal view. This matter is - later on - taken a stage further when Lyra, hiding from her pursuers aboard a Gyptian boat, has to be secreted within a cedar-wood box so that Pantaliamon is suitably subdued and rendered invisible  to the pursuers' daemons.<br />This sense of vagueness permeates the Oxford section of the book. the world in which the characters inhabit a kind of Victorian / Edwardian version of our own, but is actually intended to be a slightly skewed, parallel version. I found this to be annoying and distracting until I simply ignored the matter as an idea that hadn't been tidied up.<br />There are too many characters, which simply give an 'everything and the kitchen sink' quality to the story, their use being justifiable only in that they are used to convey some background information or to make a point. This, in conjunction with Philip Pullman's loose narrative style, robs the story of the energy I would have liked to have seen. But his writing is very consistent and more agreeable than J K Rowling's, so I'll be getting on with The Subtle Knife.<br />I know this is meant to be a book for kids, but its contents and the aforementioned endorsements make for a very bad example.	2002-04-07

With too much time on their hands, a group of well to do ladies conspire to summon the devil. This they unknowingly do, unleashing a chain of unlikely and gruesome murders. During the outbreak of the murders the perfume designer, Blaise Shima, who has an extraordinary sensitivity to odours, is drawn in by way of the strong smell of death that is coincidental with the creature / Golem that the ladies have set loose. <br />Police investigator, Subador Ind'dni is baffled by the killings but learns the truth when he is eventually confronted by the strange goings on between Blaise Shima and the Psychodynamicist, Gretchen Nunn, who has been employed by Blaise Shima's employers to discover why their top perfume designer is acting oddly.<br />Attempts to destroy the Golem appear to have succeded, but Gretchen Nunn is ultimately a replacement to the ladies that instigated the problem, and Subador Indin'dni becomes the Golem.<br />Much of this book is very similar to Iain M Banks' material, a couple of sections pretty much a precursor to sections of Use of Weapons and Against a Dark Background. The opening chapter is similar to John Updike's, The Witches of Eastwick. Overall, Golem 100 was a straightforward read apart from a few parts toward the final pages, which were a bit tiresome and which can be skimmed through. A section in which a number of murders were taking place was awkwardly handled: the break from Suabador Indin'dni to a sequence of  murders and back again, taking a page or two to figure out what the intended effect was supposed to be, since it was a stylistic divergence from the preceding text.   <br />All of the illustrations worked okay, but were sometimes a little confusing because they were either post or pre sync to the text.<br />In general, Golem 100 is a well put together piece of work all the links well thought through and convincing. The satirical aspect of the book was - I'm afraid to say -  dependant upon events that I've forgotten the relevance of,making this aspect of the book little more than slightly comedic. Doubtless there are others, who will be better informed than myself, and more appreciative of Alfred Bester's intentions...	2002-03-30

Equipped with a squint, perfectly in tune with the two dimensional nature of celluloid, the dancer-cum-actress, Leni Riefenstahl, works her way via Dr Fanck's mountain epics toward her first, own production, The Blue Light. This film is successful, winning many awards and accolades for its revolutionary cinematic qualities, and the attention of Adolf Hitler and his associates from the Third Reich's  Ministry of Propoganda. <br />After much persuasion, trouble, and interdepartmental interference, Leni Riefenstahl creates, Triumph of the Will, a film of the Nuremberg rally, so outstanding, that it is required study for aspiring film makers all around the world, especially in America, where her subsequent master-work, Olympia, was so roundly dismissed at the time of its issue prior to World War 2. She accused of being Hitler's mistress, a Third Reich propagandist, etc.<br />Leni Riefenstahl dismisses these allegations as guilt by association, and provides the reader with a clear understanding, as to what really happened. For villains are too easily created from rumour and innuendo, something it has taken a long time for Leni Riefenstahl to outlive - I was surprised to learn ( authors comment: Leni from Berlin; 2001 ).<br />Her descriptions of the technical difficulties of film making in the thirties were very interesting, making today's drag-and-drop NLE with SMPTE synchronisation, with the likes of Adobe's Premiere, much more appreciated. I also thought her use of pre and post shooting of necessary sequences for Olympia was pretty daring, yet consistent with my line of thinking, in the sense  - who's to know what happened when. <br />Her telling of her disappointment at the look of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic Flame in Greece as `duller than dull' was a hoot, her fix being to hire the best looking of the athletes present ( Anatol ) to re-shoot the event as she saw fit. She also did this for some of the night shots that had turned out badly for the athletics featuring Glenn Morris, etc.<br />It's her determination to make great films that comes across really strongly. A pity we can't get to see them today as intended if reviewers' comments for the current video releases are anything to go by.	2001-12-13

Maybe he was in earlier books and I've forgotten the details.<br />Jago's shoulder-belt buckle/clip was something that caught my eye, in this, and previous titles' artwork, but couldn't fathom why.

Waiting for Nora to return from a Christmas shopping trip he enjoys a drink in a local bar where he is reacquainted with  Dorothy, daughter of an old client, Clyde Miller Wynant, who she claims has disappeared and is under suspicion of murdering his assistant. So Nick Charles is reluctantly drawn back into his earlier profession as a private investigator.<br />All is not as it seems, and Nick Charles discovers that Clyde Miller Wynant has been murdered by his attorney, who, in consort with Wynant's ex-wife, is out to lay claim to the Wynant fortune.<br />Dashiell Hammett's writing skills are terribly stretched in what should really been a short story in order to avoid the relentless vapidity of the first 120 pages, after which the story springs to life when the Nick Charles character breaks away from the tiresome and trivial spats between various members of the Wynant household. The book's ending was also pretty dismal, with a kind of tacked on piece to help explain how conclusions were arrived at.<br />As Nora says in the last line `...it's all pretty unsatisfactory.'<br />The Thin Man is regarded by many commentators as Dashiell Hammett's worst book.

In its capacity as a ship's Mind during the Idiran war, Masaq Orbital's Hub has seen deaths it could have prevented at their most detailed. In his capacity as a Major in the Chelgrian Caste war, Quilan has seen deaths, too, and although in less detail, there is only one, which, to Quilan, was unpreventable and just as poignant. Both Hub and Quilan have a mind to die forever. But first, they must do their duty. Look to Windward would suit first time readers of Banks' work because it explains many details pertaining to the Culture, making some of his internediary works more easily followed. As a reader of all Banks' books I felt that this was a means to pad the story out, since so much of it was based on sections from other books, pretty much word-for-word. Some of the characters were of debatable importance, too. I finished Look to Windward with the strong impression that Banks has flogged this cultural pony as far as it will go. Hopefully he can turn his considerable writing skills to something fresh.	2001-08-24

Following an unsuccessful campaign against the ondat, the Ila, flees to a distant planet where she creates a new imperium through her knowledge of nano-technology.<br />Five hundred years later the woman, Luz, arrives, having persuaded the ondat - who have tracked the Ila, down - that her use of nano-technology will split the Ila's creation from her, giving the ondat the revenge they have been seeking, without the need for devastating force. The ondat give Luz thirty years to prove her plan.<br />But thirty years is not quite enough for Luz, and the ondat, not wishing to wait any further, unleash their attack on the Ila's planet by bombarding it with ever more deadly meteorite hits, to culminate in one planet shattering  strike  - the hammer.<br />At this late stage, the madman, Marak, is Luz and the Ila's only best hope to avoid the ondat's revenge.<br />This book makes sense provided it's thoroughly read without skipping sections, which is very tempting to do in the desert trekking sequences. Skipping will make you miss important explanatory details, and so the book will be very unsatisfactory as some others have claimed, and I found it to be, if I did so. <br />I would have liked to have seen the first three chapters made into one, with their details conveyed as retrospective viewpoint from the time that Marak is preparing to leave Oburan to head eastwards at Ila' behest. I feel it would have balanced the details of the opening trek towards Oburan, Marak's meeting with Ila, and been a neater segue to the outgoing journey. <br />There was a very vague sense of how much time was passing on the first outward journey. It only becoming clear in the section where the Ila was in transit, that 30 - 50 days was the time between Oburan and the Tower. No big deal perhaps, but I found it distracting. Lines like `on a certain day' not helping.<br />Some elaboration of Luz's technological capabilities would have been good, so that I wasn't wondering why she hadn't some more speedy way of conveying Marak and his colleagues back to marshall the Ila and her followers. An ATV, or some kind of air-transport to discreetly drop them off a short distance from Oburan. After all, masters of interstellar flight, nano-technology, and air-conditioned tents, etc, would reasonably be expected to have such resources to hand, given such a large ship, and where 30- 50 days is a such big factor with respect to the story's timeframe.<br />This is touched on in the last chapter at a time of about twenty years later, in which Marak recollects the need for `masks and machines' to make travel feasible in the early post-hammerfall climate. The fliers seem to be a feature of this time as well and are not necessarily part of the pre-hammerfall period. These fliers seem more akin to tiny observation aircraft, not intended to carry any burden.<br />Anyway, read it thoroughly and their shouldn't be a problem.<br />I would recommend that readers of Hammerfall read Rider at the Gate and Cloud's Rider, since they share some key details. Also get the Morgaine set, now out as one complete book. And read the Foreigner series, CJC's - to my mind anyway- best blending of technologically advanced and developing, dissimilar cultures. CJC's spacer books such as Tripoint, Downbelow Station, and Cyteen, etc, are worth looking at, too. I found the barren desert environment of Hammerfall to be evocative of the space transits between space stations.<br />I enjoyed reading Hammerfall and am looking forward to the next one.	2001-08-05

In Los Angeles, 1947, the promiscuous and movie-struck Elizabeth Short turns up murdered and mutilated at 39th and Norton. Her murder is seen as an opportunity for Lee Blanchard and Bucky Bleichert's boss to make political capital. Unfortunately, Elizabeth Short now known as the Black Dahlia had encounters with many people within the police force and local big business. Ordinarily this wouldn't be a problem, but since her elevation in death to media superstardom, any past, or ongoing investigative association is the kiss of death. For Lee Blanchard and Fritz Vogel this turns out to be literally the case by way of a very twisted road involving blackmail and  murder. For Bucky Bleichert it spells the end of a police career even though he has solved the Black Dahlia homicide.<br />In terms of plot complexity, the Black Dahlia would be pretty comparable to books by  Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler. But I felt that too many plot twists were implemented simply because many characters in the story are on the take and on the make irrespective of what side the law they are on. This was almost taken to the point of absurdity / parody, but just stopped short. Less is often more. On the other hand, since James Ellroy's  Black Dahlia is a fictional resolution of the real Black Dahlia homicide - which as I understand it is still unsolved, officially at any rate - it's possible that he employs too twisted a plot to echo the ongoing debates / discussions by interested parties on the subject.<br />With respect to the book as a piece of fiction though, many of the sequences were uncomfortably terse with respect to a resolution within themselves, their background detail barely sufficient to retain balance with the rest of the story, they being rescued from implausibility by their reintroduction as an explanation to why certain things happened. The section where Bucky Bleichert goes to Mexico to track down Lee Blanchard, and finds him dead, and makes a desperate escape back acrossthe American border is a good example of this. This section is also a good example of what I mean by overly twisting the plot to allow an extra element to Madeleine Sprague's conduct. <br />James Ellroy's Black Dahlia is a very balanced book with respect to the quality of its writing; it being evenly paced without any parts better or worse written than the others. This is not often so. I also thought that he imbued his characters with plausible traits that weren't simply tacked on to add colour; and that his prose style projected an objective and strongly passionate personality. <br />L.A. Confidential and The Cold 6000 are next.	2001-07-09

What I'm saying is that this book is comprehensive with respect to the operation of Dreamweaver, but that doesn't make the reader into a web site designer. It's how you use those tools that matter, and you don't need a lot of them. But Dreamweaver makes it a lot simpler to try out various schemes.<br />The only criticisms of this book are that a beginner will get the impression that they have to read a huge amount of stuff before even making a start, so they'll have to be patient. And a more advanced user will be familiar with a fair chunk of the content.

Friedman's 'This Alien Shore' after reading only a third of it.<br />Too much of the story lacks any focus or sense of direction, it jumping from one theme or  character to another, with little sense of purpose other than to extend the amount of pages to say anything. Her use of imperial measurements instead of metric jarrs within a future sci-fi context. Her use of terms such as Brain-Ware, Hackers, etc, is unlikely and out of date. Such terms may be new and exciting to C.S.F., but not to me. This needs more thought for future work. And there is the rather obvious influences: Iain M Banks' The Player of Games, Look to Windward. A little bit of C.J. Cherryh even down to chapter titles such as Serpent's Reach. A touch of The Silence of the Lambs - the scene where Masada is telling his colleague about the care and attention lavished on the virus' design is an almost straight re-run of when Starling is being talked to by the insect expert about the Death-head Moth and its creator/keeper. I was expecting to see some of Peter Hoeg's Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow. in here as well, but I didn't spot it from what I read.<br />I thought the links from chapter to chapter were well done, and where C.S.F. settles down to write a section with any plausible substance - such as the one in which Masada was introduced - it works fine. If only she could have pulled focus on the whole thing and kept some consistency about what she was writing about, including attention to technical details, this would have been a good read. As it is, it sprawls limply along, with an occasional suggestion of what it could have been - preferably in two thirds of its current length.<br />Perhaps the editor-goddess should have gotten off her throne and done some.	2001-04-26

This book, despite its modest cost, is probably the worst I've come across for what is a very useful application for creating cross-platform e-documents. What is does do well is self evident given a little time and patience with the program; what you would like to know about is incorrect; and what you don't need to know about is gone into at great length. In short - a particularly useless and frustrating book written by someone who should know better, since he is one of Adobe's top-rated authors. I wouldn't like to be reading their least-able if this is what is reckoned to be of merit. <br />To be fair, even Adobe can't make much of a job with their own in-house publications and their included help-guide, which, although comprehensive, is incredibly irritating to wade through.<br />Someday - Somebody - Somewhere, will  be able to produce a book, or books that will actually tell us how to use all those great applications without us having to sweat blood. <br />Meanwhile...

A group of teenagers who live in a gated community and provided with everything that their parents reckon they should have, suddenly go on the rampage, kill all the adults, and disappear. The police officer investigating the incident figures that the kids reacted against what he comes to consider as sensory deprivation. A young girl is found, left behind by the others. She is the police's best hope of smoking the others out. But the other kids mount a rescue mission to snatch her from a secured hospital after which they again disappear to become rarely seen outlaws.<br />I liked this short book because it presented a good idea with an element of drive I wouldn't normally associate with J G Ballard's rather gentlemanly pace. The illustrations were very nice, too.	2001-03-06

Nevertheless, I found it to be very fumy, made more so by the way in which the conventions of e-mail messages tie the various characters together within the mailing group. For example, RE: `I'm gutting'. - This is the CEO from Helsinki, Pertti van Helden replying to London's CEO, David Crutton, with regard to the abrasive brush-off sent in response to his rejected advertising campaign. <br />I know it sounds a bit nerdy to cite such a technicality as an interesting and novel way to add dynamics to a story but the RE:s work really well to add context to the actions and reactions of the characters. <br />The occasional `Attachment' also works well as a way to spread the vitriol at the speed of e. <br />I thought e was similar to Nicholson Baker's `VOX' . VOX was two characters on a Chat Line. The principle is exactly the same but across a wider net of participants.<br />The spoof, millershanks,  web-site is worth having a look at, too.	2001-02-16

Precursor is - unlike so many that are hyped to be - pageturningly unputdownable.A little too quickly paced at the start, but maybe that's because I was expecting something different. <br />It's a pity Defender is being held back until the summer of 2001.

On Writing splits into three sections: growing up and how he developed an interest in writing; tips on preferred writing practice; how writing helped him cope after his road accident. <br />The book was interesting in that SK recognises that quality writing occurs when the story isn't driven by a ruthlessly predetermined plot but is formed through a process of suggestion as a seed idea is laid down and worked upon - a process that is at the heart of any good design. On the other hand, SK doesn't recognise how limited his own writing is, as the `worked' example at the end of the book clearly shows; a discrepancy that occurs in titles such as Nightmares and Dreamscapes, and Gerald's Game. <br />In Nightmares and Dreamscapes the broad range of subject matter lacks credibility, and in many cases comes across as competent exercises. There's a distinct lack of heart/truthfulness/projection of personality. In Gerald's game he chickened out and inserted a completely unnecessary character  - the psycho with the bag of bones - into what was a terrific story.<br />I enjoyed reading On Writing.

In a period of a little over six months Bren Cameron has been catapulted from a fairly relaxed routine of Paidhi (interpreter), researcher, and intermediary to one in which atevi and human resources are geared toward an accelerated space programme. A space programme that had been little more than an exercise in atevi-human co-operation until the spaceship Phoenix had suddenly appeared and docked at the long ago abandoned space-station high in orbit above the atevi's planet. Ordinarily only one human is allowed onto the atevi mainland. But now there are three. Bren Cameron; Bren's stand-in, Deanna Hanks, who has joined factions opposed to Tabini and his allies; and Jason Graham, the Phoenix's representative, Bren's student and direct responsibility. Bren Cameron now has plenty to occupy his mind: possible assassination, inter-atevi aggression, inter-human aggression, atevi-human aggression, attempted sabotage of the space programme, and keeping his new charge, Jason Graham, from making any, to himself, life threatening faux pas. As well as all this, Bren Cameron wonders why the Phoenix has returned in the first place...     <br />The first time around this book seems to be much slower paced than Foreigner and Invader because it tends to dwell on scenes that are necessary for the development of the plot more than would seem reasonable. But when read again, the whole thing fairly zips along, which was surprising.	2000-12-01

Unlike those books, the prose style is Algren at his most polished. Even so he overdoes it on many occasions where a simple statement would have sufficed. But redeems himself by pretty much avoiding the annoying switch in viewpoint within multiple character scenes that mar his other, otherwise excellent work. <br />Nelson Algren didn't write all that many books in his long career, a state of affairs that could be condensed into two titles: A Walk on the Wild Side and The Man with the Golden Arm.	2000-11-10

As a basic get-going this Dummies issue isn't too bad, in that it explains the menu options and some rudiments. That said, I found it to be rather disappointing in the way it approached matters; it tending to start a subject, dive off somewhere else, returning to what you started with someplace else - maybe chapters later. <br />The opening chapters were rambling and repetitive with useful details mentioned in passing, For example, shift+enter is a line break and the enter key is a paragraph break. I missed this the first time around and, after finding the function by accident, spotted it in the book's text by chance. <br />The way in which table-sizing was handled was also clumsy: all you have to do is use the mouse and click and drag the sizing handles like in other programmes instead of always going through the property inspector. <br />Too much space was spent in giving examples of other peoples' work which wasn't particularly poignant (18oz being a remarkable piece of nonsense) and, more often than not, a contradiction to the better practices preached.<br />Okay, the book covers a lot: Dreamweaver 3,  Fireworks 3, and Flash 4. But in rather an unnecessarily schematic way within the space provided to avoid the feeling that I should be reading something more advanced and which still covered the opening basics.<br />Nevertheless it's reasonable value at the price.	2000-10-30

Now Bren Cameron has to contend with factions amongst the atevi and some new ones from his own side,  everyone wanting to make sure that whatever the returned Phoenix has to offer is available to them. And so, Bren Cameron has his work cut out in the struggle to keep both atevi and human interests satisfied as he dodges the assassins' bullets. <br />This book builds directly onto what went before in Foreigner. It works really well in its elaboration of the plot, and the development of the relationship between Bren and Jago, and Bren and everybody else - atevi and human. Invader was also good because you can read it first without getting lost. The essential elements from Foreigner are reiterated but not so that someone who has read Foreigner first would find it a problem.	2000-10-24

If you've got $50,000.00 in liquid assets, contact the Foundation of Immortality and Benedict Howards will have you frozen until technology can bring you round and cure your ailment - forever. So a Negro without his assets in a suitably liquid state bugs Jack Barron, about how he's been refused a place in the Foundation of Immortality's freezers; that he's being racially prejudiced. This claim is refuted, and in order to win Jack Barron's allegiance Benedict Howards offers Jack Barron the chance of immortality - for real - forever. And whilst Jack Barron is sorely tempted to play along, their comes a point beyond which even he won't cross...<br />Only the slang and political references in this book would be a problem to today's younger readers.

After an absence of 200-years, Phoenix, the spaceship of human origin, has docked with the long abandoned space station that orbits the planet of the Atevi. Although one of the very few humans, if not the only one who can serve to safeguard the operation of the treaty which exists to prevent war between the humans and the Atevi, interlocutor and translator Bren Cameron is placed in mortal danger by the leader of the Atevi's Western Alliance, Tabini-ajii, to test the trustworthiness of Bren Cameron, and the loyalty of his grandmother Ilisidi, to counter the sharp increase in political tension that has been triggered by the return of Phoenix. Political tension which threatens to endanger the lives of millions of humans and Atevi.   It has been a few years since I last read Foreigner, with its blend of suspense, irony, mystery and intrigue, which, unusually for this genre, is a complete story. A complete story in the sense that it is not simply a collection of contrived coincidences and episodes. With all that in its favour, it would be interesting to see Foreigner in the form of a movie.	2000-10-09

Bruno Bicek and Steffi R. have dreams beyond the reality of their Chicago existence and the nightmarish control of the Barber, Bonifacy Konstantine. Bruno Bicek is a boxing contender and Steffi R. is the girlfriend he let be gang-raped. The Barber knows this and that Bruno Bicek has murdered one of the gang. The Barber has Steffi R. in his grasp and has no intention of letting her go. Bruno Bicek feels sure of his chances and intends taking her from him. But the Barber holds all the cards and, for Bruno Bicek and Steffi R. there will be no bright morning.<br />Never Come Morning has its moments: the fight scenes at the start and end of the book; the scenes in which the characters consider their lives, in a  style that will be made much use of in The Man with the Golden Arm. Everything else is dark and gritty, but is not especially effective within the story because of its apparent inclusion for the sake of something anecdotal in order to flesh out the characters' traits and thoughts. In addition, Nelson Algren makes reading this book a chore like he did with The Man with the Golden Arm, by having rapid changes of viewpoint in scenes with a multiplicity of characters. This would have been quite benign given a more omniscient writing style like Fritz Leiber's, but is very distracting here.<br />Nevertheless, Never Come Morning is engaging, and, taken in overview, is a very satisfactory read, which demonstrates the power in Nelson Algren's writing. A power that in subsequent works, grows and grows.	2000-10-06

Kate's feelings lie with one of her colleagues, however, who refuses to be disloyal to his wife. But in the end, Kate has to balance what is good for The Business, the prince and his country, and her feelings.<br />The Business is something of a departure for Iain Banks in that there isn't any of the grisly stuff one would associate with his books.

But in contradiction to others, I'd say  that 'Tis is a better written one, despite the disparity of its first  chapter and Angela's Ashes' last chapter, and the heavy handedness in the  use of recurring motifs, which became more agreeably applied in the story's  last quarter. <br />In Angela's Ashes the best parts were when Frank was  describing events outside of the family, such as his school days and when  he was out and about by himself. 'Tis took that a stage further  stylistically.   'Tis can be slow in places too much time being spent with  his army days and not enough on the intermediary stages thereafter. For  example, there's a lot of space given to Frank's premarital goings on with  Alberta but hardly anything when they're married. More time is spent on the  ways the school kids manipulate Frank.  <br />Nevertheless, I would now agree  with some of the jacket's hype concerning Frank McCourt's literary merits.  He, at last, seems to have found his groove.	2000-08-28

Harlan Ellison has pointed out that, in general, a Stephen King book is  based on a very simple idea that could be presented in the form of a  novella. And so could Cujo if it weren't for SK's use of multiple,  moderately intense viewpoint, which he doesn't use too often. Gerald's Game  is an example of one of SK's stories in which he uses moderately intense  viewpoint, more successfully than in Cujo (its effectiveness being spoiled  by the inclusion of the unnecessary Mr Bag of Bones at the end). <br />For the  most part, Cujo reads like any other SK book, with its heavy use of  cynicism, colloquialism, and product placement. But the viewpointed parts  tend to slow the pace a little because they are not integrated as well as  they could have been; they tending to give a kind of added for the sake of  feel to the flow of things.<br />Nevertheless, Cujo is up to SK's usual  standards, but inconsistent with Harlan Ellison's overly enthusiastic  recommendation.

On a small island, joined to the mainland by a narrow bridge, in a remote  part of Scotland Frank Cauldhame is the Laird of his domain. He surrounds  himself with his Sacrifice Poles, which he ritualistically adorns with  small-animal body parts, and his ultimate contrivance, The Factory, sited  in the loft of his father's house. The Factory is made up of a scrapped  clock-tower clock face laid flat, and modified to incorporate trap doors  leading to an acid bath, a flame pit, and so on. The Factory is safe from  his father's interference because Frank's father has a bad leg - the result  of being mown down by his determinedly departing ex-wife on her 500cc BSA  motorcycle, its petrol tank emblazoned with the Eye of Suaron, a few days  after she has given birth to Frank's younger brother, Paul - and can't  climb into the loft.<br />Up to a point Frank is pretty much in control, and,  by way of various schemes, kills Paul, his cousin Esmerelda, and another  boy, Blythe. The consequences of a  phase he was going through, Frank tells  us in conjunction with the telling of how he attends to the destruction of  a local rabbit colony using catapulted steelies ( ball bearings), and a  flame thrower made up from a plastic squeeze-bottle. Frank's only sign of  remorse from the rabbit episode is directed towards his catapult, The Black  Destroyer,  irreparably damaged when he has to club one of the flamed  rabbits to death with it, when the injured rabbit tries to attack him.  Frank buries The Black Destroyer with the aid of his trowel, Stout  Stroke.<br />And then there's Eric, Frank's older brother, an ex-medical  student with a habit of setting animals, mostly dogs, on fire. He's on his  way home to the island, a trail of destruction in his wake. But Frank has  been forewarned by The Factory, and subsequently, Eric's lunatic phone  calls.<br />The Wasp Factory was the first of Iain Bank's books I read, and  re-read recently to see how it compared to the others that I'd read since.  It's not quite as polished as his later works, yet demonstrates the power  that has become his trademarks: the strong literary drive, and those really  articulate descriptions of things and scenes. On the other hand, The Wasp  Factory has saddled him with the need to imbue a lot of his output with  what can best be described as obligatory horror. For example: The chair in  Use of Weapons. The millstone, and cannon scenes in A Song of Stone. With  The Business he has managed to break away from this tendency, without any  problems that I could see.<br />The Wasp Factory isn't really a work of   horror, but  it's streets ahead of  most of those who are credited with the  writing of such.	2000-08-20

That's what Tristen instructs his shieldman, Uwen, to do because Tristen has no concept of how coin relates to material things like grain, sheep,  cattle, etc. Tristen has Uwen demonstrate the value of his pocket change  after which, they head down to the counting room at the foot of Emuin's  tower, where the extent of Heryn Aswydd's  tax revenue is revealed. Some of  this cache Tristen decides to make available to those who will be loyal to  Cefwyn's fight against Tasmorden, who has taken over Llefinian, the capital  of Ninevrise's Elwynor. A little ironic for the loyalists, since they are  now to be paid from what was Heryn Aswydd's excessive taxation.<br />This was  something of a highlight for this book, others being restricted to one  liners, like when the disgraced Luriel is summoned into court: `Fox colors  to cover a vixen's heart, Cefwyn thought,...' ( this relates to Luriel's  cloak). These little throwaways brightened up a relentless barrage of  detail reiterated through various points of view using both inner thought,  and dialogue. Nothing new for a C. J. Cherryh book: I know, I read plenty  of them. But this time she took it too far, even for me. <br />In previous  titles I've come to expect the first seventy to one hundred pages to be  this indulgent before the story opens up, to then progress smartly enough.  Not here though. It took almost three hundred pages for the narrative to  get going in the engaging way that I would have expected for the book as a  whole. I almost called it quits at page 260, but soldiered on. I knew it  would probably be worthwhile at the end of it all. Which it was, as usual.  But what a slog. <br />So why give it five stars. As with most of CJC's books  you have to look at it as an overall package: long on viewpoint, short on  related action, and all tied together with clever, threadlike details. Some  of her titles are more balanced with regard to viewpoint, and action, but  not by much. Iain Banks is more effective in this regard, but is not quite  as emotionally engaging. David Gemmelll can write very fine extended action  sequences, as at the end of Midnight Falcon, but doesn't do viewpoint  particularly well. <br />Fortress of Owls has the engaging, emotional impact I  would expect, but falls far short of being an engaging read.

The most exciting part of this book was the cover, with its imaginative use of a line of coke spattered across a reflective metal surface, set over  a background thermal image. <br />What this story lacked was drive, something  that should have been, since this is a first person, present tense  narrative. Ballard is supposed to be avant-garde, but comes across like a  so, so Agatha Christie. And Will Self, The Observer contributor, who  grandly states that Ballard's writing `knocks the work of other avant-garde  writers work into a hatted cock', should know better. Then again, probably  not from what I've read of his. <br />Now if only Iain Banks had written this  book, then you'd have been treated to some real avant-garde writing. Go  read Complicity, and you'll see what I mean.	2000-08-17

I enjoyed reading this short, non mathematical, history by probably the  most well publicised of today's scientific gurus. It was interesting to  note how so much of the current elements of sci-fi with regard to black  holes, warped space, and so on, are more than sixty years old; and that,  the two keystones for all of this, Einstein and Hiesenberg, weren't singing  from the same hymn sheet.<br />This lack of agreement like the lack of  agreement of whether electromagnetic phenomena are waves or particles falls  prey to the dubious justification of observation in our three dimensional  realm of existence, making Stephen Hawking's book little more than a veneer  of credibility on matters that are essentially conjecture. This book is  really a raking over of well known theories, presented in a jaunty style,  but with nothing to add by way of clarification. It still hits the buffers,  as does everybody else, when it has to deal with explaining, in plain  language, the finite, the infinite, and how mass and energy are related to  these two extremes.<br />Perhaps a mathematical treatment of incomprehensible  complexity is the answer to these shortcomings. But as the journalist Barry  Fox once wrote (and I paraphrase): If someone has to show me the math to  justify themselves I know they're bluffing.	2000-07-07

To pay for their passage, and to provide for  themselves, they sell their land, the cattle acquired from other family  members who have gone to dig for gold in California, and other sundries.  Things don't go as smoothly as hoped, however, their ship sinking,  resulting in the family becoming separated: a matter ultimately resolved by  Molly O'Kelley's `older man' bonny Prince Connie.<br />A Smile Across The  Wheat contains some interesting historical elements, the most notable being  the way in which those who couldn't afford to pay for their passage were  let take their chances and, in many cases, starve to death, since no food  was made available to them. Matters such as these are not gone into in any  great depth, but should be sufficient to encourage the younger audience  that I feel this book would be most attractive to, to pursue further in  books that are purely historical and which Barbara Farr Kelley should be  able to advise upon.<br />Overall, A Smile Across The Wheat is well paced,  making for an entertaining, good hearted read.	2000-07-02

After receiving a letter from an old college friend, John Ellis, the writer George Kramer travels to a small Californian town out in the desert. Here he is confronted by strange happenings, the result of another of his  old college friends, Daniel Kesserich, who has discovered, quite by  accident, a way to use an energy anomaly of collapsing magnetic fields to  move in the super-time of the fifth dimension, and thus the time of the  fourth dimension. This activity normally has no consequences with regard to  the surrounding town and its population. But when Kesserich uses his  discovery to return John Ellis' wife from the dead, the result of a  seemingly accidental poisoning, the town's population succumb to a general  psychological trauma due to the temporal contradictions set in motion.    There's a lot of good ideas in this little book, which before its recent  publication have appeared in other Leiber titles, such as, Gonna Roll them  Bones, and The Big Time.  Daniel Kesserich is slightly lumpy to read,  especially at the start where the narrative is not quite as smooth as is  usual for a Fritz Leiber story, making it necessary to read the first  chapter and the forward a couple of times to iron out any apparent  oddities.  <br />Overall that's the main complaint in an otherwise nicely  presented book with its great black-and-white illustrations and text on  quality paper. It's A Leiber all right, but suffers slightly from not  having the benefit of his ultimate attention. <br />Worth reading all the  same.	2000-06-14

Bill O'Neil's 24 Essential Lessons for Investment Successis a very readable little book containing some sound advice, but none,which in general application, isn't regarded as good practice already by any other book of this type. The majority of this book concerns itself with the application of an investment model closely tied to Mr O'neil's Investment Business Daily, and Daily Graphs. And that model is only relevant within the working practices of the American Stock Market, and its performance characteristics over the last forty years. <br />It seems to me, that by following the recommended procedures, to the letter, in conjunction with the much heralded Investment Business Daily, Mr O'Neil's assertions will be mostly self fulfilling: after all, if you only buy expensive stocks imbued with all the requisite characteristics and religiously sell at 8% below the buying price to minimise losses there's not much risk. But in order to maintain that security you need to keep up with IBD and Daily Graphs at further dollars, since the model is graphically based. <br />It was, also, quite a hoot to read Bill's opinion of foreign stocks and how they were dubious in comparison to those from the States because of uncertain political climates. As I type this, Microsoft, one of Bill's greatest examples, is being well marked down by the uncertainty of the ongoing anti-trust action, that looks to me, over here, in the UK, as sheer bloody mindedness by the American courts. So much then for the greatly lauded system of free enterprise. For further insight to this, read the, Brokers, chapter of Studs Terkel's, `Working' in which a long serving stockbroker, Ray Wax, talks about his time in the Market, Jesse Livermore, and the 1066.  <br />Anyway, 24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success , is good to read in itself, but care should be exercised if contemplating any further investment in Mr O'Neil's publications, since the not inconsiderable sums of money might be more gainfully employed in some of those less than $15.00 shares, he so dislikes.

I don't often read comedy books, they tend to try too hard to be funny at every possible moment; they just don't know when to quit and give the reader a breather. Bill Fitzhugh's, Pest Control, is an exception to this,  it being highly humorous, but careful not to overdo it. <br />Basically, the  story centres around the character Bob Dillon, who dissatisfied with the  use of poisons to kill bugs, such as cockroaches, etc., quits his job to go  freelance and do the same job with his specially bred Assassin Bugs. He  advertises his services as `The Exterminator' and accidentally becomes of  interest to those who hire hit-men, and, in turn, the real hit-men who see  him as competition. A misunderstanding compounded by some coincidental  killings which Bob had nothing to do with. Bob does get to try his assassin  bugs out, too, but they prove to be as big, and in some cases a bigger   pest, than the pests their meant to control. <br />This is a well written,  really fun book to kill a lazy weekend with.	2000-06-11

I've recently read, Charles Portis', True Grit.    With respect to the Western context you can see where Clint Eastwood's Fistfull of Dollars and High Plains Drifter came out of, though that has been as much  attributed to Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest. And although I wanted to like  this book as much as my vague memory of it suggested, I found it to be slow  going, with it's unengaging prose style, exacerbated by the first person  retrospection of the main character, which was too detailed to be  convincing for a boy so young. A characteristic not unique to Jack Schaefer  for this kind of book. Sure the story was good, heavily viewpointed, and  moralistic, but that kind of thing is done better now, as in the Star Trek  tie in books by the likes of L.A, Graf, and K.W. Jeter.  It seems to me  that Shane is a book of its time, which is unfortunately not this one, with  respect to the younger audience it was originally intended for.<br />For me  it's the style of Shane more than anything else, that leaves me  unenthusiastic. But it should please others.	2000-06-06

The drugstore owner, the hooker, the ex-stockbroker and steel worker, the nurse, the school teacher, etc., all these people have committed their working life's experience to tape from which Studs Terkel then puts this  great book together. And whilst the stories are all fascinating, they do  seem to suffer from a kind of homogeneous quality, as if, no matter who the  interviewee is, the characters' voices all seem to sound like the same  person, only the details determining their sex or experience, adding any  differentiation. A minor point, I know, but it tends to veil the  individuals beneath a worn down resignedness of whether their experiences  were good, bad, or so, so.  <br />I was alerted to this book when reading a  Stephen King article about banned books in American colleges, this being  one of them, after a school kid used it as the basis for a homework  exercise and his mother threw a fit over it. I can't see why myself, but  there you are.<br />Working, is nearly thirty years old now. Nonetheless, its  just as relevant today as when Studs Terkel wrote it.

US	49978572	R2OBZYXM3Y49KG	0671654179	601574523	The Paladin	Books	5	15	15	N	N	One of C.J.Cherryh's finer works.	In search of the means of revenge the scarred, peasant girl, Taizu turns for help to the reclusive sword master, Shoka, on his mountain retreat. Shoka refuses her request as he does all others, his skills not for hire.  But Taizu persists and Shoka acquiesces, reckoning it unlikely that she  will master the sword, or even if she does, time will have mellowed her  outlook and she will be content to remain as his companion. Two years pass,  and although Taizu has gained skill with the sword, and she and Shoka have  shared his bed, her hunger for revenge is undiminished. So Shoka is left  with no alternative but follow her. <br />During their cross-country progress,  news travels fast. And as well as attending to Taizu's demands Shoka  becomes the figurehead for a rebellion against Lord Ghita and his allies  who have taken control of the Chiyaden throne.<br />This book is similar to  The Goblin Mirror, Cuckoo's Egg, and Rimrunners in its easy to read style  whist retaining her use of intense viewpoint to embellish the  characterisation in a way which doesn't tend to overwhelm the plot like  some of her more densely written books can, to the point of tedium:  Fortress of Eagles being a good example. <br />The Paladin, whist not having  the breadth of scope of some of her other works, is nonetheless,  significantly better than the majority of her rivals' fantasy-genre  offerings, with its tight, straightforward prose, and its clever  developments of what at face value would be considered of little  significance. But this is a C.J. Cherryh trademark: a sort of, when a  butterfly flaps its wings in Peking, what's the consequences, sort of  thing. Which, for me, is one of the main reasons why I look forward to  reading her work as much as I do.    <br />They say `never judge a book by its  cover', but I think the Brian Salmon (for Mandarin UK) artwork is a better  match for the story than the current one. Taizu looks a lot more like the  peasant girl she's said to be.	2000-05-30

With the battle of the Ringmasters over, the series' main characters take stock, of some of the elements that featured in Lightning and Intrigue. In Rhomatum, Kiyrstin and Lidye, both pregnant, slug it out regarding their personal difficulties, what to do about the incomplete ring complement  following the battle, and who is really in charge of them. And in a  soldiers' camp situated close to a newly developing node between Rhomatum  and Khoratum are the three Rhomandi brothers, and Ganfrion. Here, on a  minor level, we have the explanation of what happened to Deymorin's horse  Ringer. And on a somewhat more dramatic level we learn the true nature of  Dancer, only hinted at during the close of Lightning. <br />Dancer is a  development, which, in less sensitive hands could have become as dubious as  her descriptions of the physicality of sex could have degenerated into  fluffy. For Dancer is a Child of Rakshi, a 'Tweener, with three  personalities: androgynous, male, and female. And to complicate matters  further, Dancer and Mikhyel are now lovers. Mikhyel's problem is how to  reconcile himself and his associates, perhaps the long suffering Nethaalye  in particular, to the idea of such a union, whilst Dancer's is one of  coming to terms with the notion that in Mikhyel's frame of reference Dancer  is a freak of nature, not the creature of purity that Mother encouraged  Dancer to believe in. <br />Jane Fancher's skill, with this potential  hell-brew, is well demonstrated by the following line from the scene in  which Mikhyel and Dancer are intimates.              `Temorii's hands  sought the sensitive instrument of loving that had gone suddenly silent, a  gently teasing touch that brought Mikhyel easily back to the music....'  (Temorii is Dancer's female side). I thought that was so nicely done,  unlike so many others' attempts at such.<br />These matters take up  approximately the first half of the book. From there we move quickly onto  Rhomatum, where Mikhyel busieshimself in, post-battle, legalities in order  to stabilise the Rhomatum web inclusive of potential others from the recent  fall out. Deymorin takes charge of casting the replacement  Giephaetum/Shatum and Khoratum/Persitum rings, and discovers his talent for  ringspinning, which might usurp Lidye's hold. And Nikeanor's eighteenth  birthday comes around, a time of celebration Lidye intends to use to  reinforce her own grasp on power.<br />The final section with its defeat of  their old adversary, rom Maurii, and the birth of the three brothers'  babies is a conclusion of the story so far. But there's plenty to keep the  series spinning on. <br />I read fairly widely in this genre, and feel, after  reading all three, so far, of this series, that these books are one of the  truly worthwhile additions to the field, in terms of quality of writing,  development of character, world building, and originality of themes.  They're definitely worth any serious fantasy fan's dollars.	2000-04-30

A month after the destruction at Boreton Turnout, the Rhomandi brothers Deymorin, Mikhyel, and Nikaenour along with Deymorin's companion, Kiyrstin, return to Rhomatum only to be immediately arrested on entering the city. It is feared that they might be impostors wanting to make mischief now that  the Ley-web has become damaged, or that the real brothers have returned  with the machine that can harness lightning and so cause even more damage.  A night passes, and Nikaenour, upon his release, demands that his wife,  Lidye, have the others set free, too. Mostly, the arrests have been a  nuisance, but Mikhyel has fallen victim to the prisoner Ganfrion, who  forces him to perform sexual acts and which Ganfrion uses to blackmail  Mikhyel into promising future favours.<br />The brothers discover that  Anheliaa, the ringmaster, is slowly dying. And the city council are  demanding an explanation regarding the state of the Ley-web, and what is  intended to be done about it. Mikhyel and Kiyrstin set the council's  immediate fears to rest.  But it falls to Mikhyel and Deymorin to attend to  the outer nodes' confidence in the Rhomandi, and rally the troops in case  of attack from their old adversary the Mauritumin, and their Northern  Crescent allies.<br />Like its predecessor, Ring of lightning, this book  concerns itself ( even more so now that the number of direct associations  have increased), with how the principal characters see themselves in  relation to one another and the outside world; human, and  non-human;  politically, familially, and magically. This makes for an interesting mix  of romance, and vested interests, which I found to be gritty, subtle in its  development of plot line, and at times, appropriately humorous. So anyone  who likes their fantasy  more involving than usual, should find this book,  along with its stablemates, good reading.	2000-04-11

Following the interception of a spaceship of unusually high capability, crewed by creatures from a world nine light years distant, the cat-like, judge warrior, Duun-Hatani becomes the central figure in a covert programme  through which a human baby boy is genetically engineered from the last of  the spaceship's dead crew. He calls the boy - Thorn. <br />Duun gambles that,  Thorn, after becoming integrated into their society and, through the use of  archive material - mostly tape recordings - found on the spaceship, will  become sufficiently well versed in human traits, also, that he can mediate  between the two cultures, if they should meet up, again, sometime in the  future. From Duun's perspective this could be next decade or next week:  neither he nor anyone else are sure of the spaceship's real capability  despite having duplicated one, and Duun's people are incapable of speaking  or interpreting the information on the tapes. It is hoped that Thorn will  have inherited some instinctive means by which he can grasp the meaning of  the tape recordings. This turns out to be the case. Duun has Thorn send a  message. And they wait.<br />Like the rest of C.J.C's Sci-Fi I have read,  Cuckoo's Egg primarily concerns itself with the characters' motivation and  the thinking behind it, imbuing her books with a high degree of  reader-character association. I find this adds an extra dimension to what  would be fairly standard for the genre in terms of action, technology, and  plot, creating stories, which transcend the limitations of such;  a  robustness that makes me remember them much more easily than would usually  be the case with others' work. <br />Readers of Cuckoo's Egg should also find  the following worthwhile: Cyteen, and the Foreigner series, both of which  draw quite heavily on Cuckoo's Egg for some of their inner details.	2000-04-05

After the death of his baby sister, Frank's family leave depression era New York City, to take up residence in the even more impoverished, pre-WW2, Limerick, in which his Northern Irish born father is not accepted despite  `doing his bit' for Ireland in the uprising. And so, the family, without  any income except from what is gained through various charities poor-relief  schemes, and occasional help from begrudging relatives, struggle to  survive. A state not helped by Frank's alcoholic father, who can never hold  a job, drinks the dole, and never sends any money back from England where  he gets a full time job in a munitions factory during the war. <br />Frank,  himself, survives Typhoid and Conjunctivitis, and as soon as he can leaves  school, in spite of his schoolmasters' advice, to earn enough money as a  telegram boy and return to America, and maybe have his mother, Angela, and  his remaining brothers join him in the future.<br />And that's about it  basically. Some readers will find the book to be a source of reminders of  what life was like for them or their forebears in the Ireland of that time.  Some will take it as a simple `against all odds story'. For me though,  there were  elements, which were part of my own upbringing: the rebel songs  like Roddy McCorly, Kevin Barry, etc.,  my dad ( who coincidentally comes  from Antrim, and is a retired school teacher like Frank ) would play on a,  BSR Monarch, record player at home. But unlike Frank, I haven't been asked  to die for Ireland.   But Frank has another message, which is - I think:  Ireland, I owe you nothing. And in spirit, a contradiction to the romantic  stereotype of book and screen,  you can be as cold as Angela's ashes.	2000-04-04

He almost  finds it from his association, with, bar-girl, Molly Novotny, but has it  snatched away by Sparrow's coerced betrayal.<br />This is a very powerful  book, which stands comparison to anything written today.

So Tansy being the good wife she is, and in a  moment of self doubt, disposes of her hoard of graveyard dirt, pieces of  hair, scraps of metal, and dried herbs, etc. At first nothing seems to  change, as Norman had insisted it wouldn't, but as Tansy had hitherto  believed, the Saylors become the target of the other wives' ambitions -  especially Mrs Carr's. <br />To begin with, Norman's moral conduct is  questioned by some his colleagues in an attempt to discredit him, then the  family cat, Totem, is brutally killed. But Norman, the unbeliever, ignores  the get-out-of-town advice, and has his life threatened by Tansy whose soul  has been taken over by the other wives.    <br />By this time Norman begins to  consider the notion of witchcraft more seriously, and applies himself to a  steep learning curve in order to outsmart the other wives and so get  Tansy's soul back to where it belongs.<br />In hindsight it seems that Norman  was being used as a way to get at Tansy so that he would convince her to  shed herself of her protections and so become vulnerable to the other  wives' combined attack. For it turns out that they knew, though Tansy  didn't, that Tansy was the most powerful of them all.     <br />OUR LADY OF  DARKNESS: Franz Westen, a writer who converts `Weird Underground'  television episodes into novels, falls prey to a curse put upon another -  Clark Ashton Smith - by the long dead founder of Megapolisomancy, Thibaut  de Castries. This is a consequence of three chance happenings: the buying  of a book in a second-hand shop inside which Thibaut de Castries has  secreted thecurse between lightly gummed together pages; the taking up of  residence at 607 Rhodes, a room in an apartment building that had been  lived in by Thibaut de Castries and frequented by Clark Ashton Smith, and  concealed within the walls of which is hidden another text -`The Fifty  Cipher'; and the viewing of a brown robed figure on the peak of Corona  heights - a hilltop directly in front of Franz Westen's living room  window.<br />In today's terms this is horror in the style of The Blair Witch  Project. A story permeated by a sense of menacing creepiness. <br />Our Lady  of Darkness continues one of the, forty years earlier, themes of Conjure  Wife; that women are possessed of the power of witchcraft to a greater or  lesser degree, so creating the linkage for this pairing. As is usual for  Fritz Leiber, the writing is tremendously slick.<br />I really enjoyed this  book, and have read it three times already.	2000-03-30

This book draws upon a large cast of characters' view points to fill out its four hundred plus pages, making me wonder if some of them serve any greater purpose. But this is book one of three, so it remains to be seen.  Even so, it builds very satisfactorily towards the next one, using Zavahl's  escape from the sacrificial pyre as a closure. There was a bit of a black  hole after the pacey Chapter One until Veldan and Kaz reappeared by Chapter  Four. Whilst this left space to introduce the bulk of the other players it  would have been more agreeable, for the sake of focus, to have brought them  in and out briefly instead: after all, everything at that stage happens at  much the same time. Nonetheless it all shoots along with good tie-ins  between the characters, including details you think have been missed: Scall  realising who Seriema's attacker is being a good example. I thought the  prose style was better than most of the British fantasy stuff that I've  read lately, though it is a little over extended in places, and a lot of  the fancier words could have been replaced with plainer ones to better  effect. (I'm not sure that `misanthropic' with respect to the donkey's  character was really the best choice.) Neither J.R. R. Tolkien, Fritz  Leiber, or C.J. Cherryh, for example, resort to such. Anyway, I'm keen to  find out how Shree escapes from Blade's trans-dimensional black bag, and so  on.	2000-03-30

This is a consequence of three chance happenings: the buying  of a book in a second-hand shop inside which Thibaut de Castries has  secreted the curse* between lightly gummed together pages; the taking up of  residence at 607 Rhodes, a room in an apartment building that had been  lived in by Thibaut de Castries and frequented by Clark Ashton Smith, and  concealed within the walls of which is hidden another text -`The Fifty  Cipher'; and the viewing of a brown robed figure on the peak of Corona  heights - a hilltop directly in front of Franz Westen's living room  window.<br />In today's terms this is horror in the style of The Blair Witch  Project. A story permeated by a sense of menacing creepiness, instead of a  graphic gorefest.<br />Our Lady of Darkness continues one of the, forty years  earlier, themes of Conjure Wife; that women are possessed of the power of  witchcraft to a greater or lesser degree, so creating the linkage for this  pairing. As is usual for Fritz Leiber, the writing is tremendously slick;  so much so, that I can't think of anyone in the horror field at present who  could pull off what has been done here. It would take a writer capable of  good literary prose such as Ian Banks, Nicholson Baker, or C.J. Cherryh to  match it. And since that isn't likely to happen any time soon, I would  recommend that anyone interested in what can be done with the horror genre,  should get their hands on these stories before they go out of print. <br />And  to the publishers, TOR: I prefer the previous design; the Wayne Barlowe  cover. Its more sophisticated artwork compliments the stories better. Maybe  it could be made available as a hardback like the `Dealings of Daniel  Kesserich'. It'd be worth  the price, if not more so.             * `A  CURSE upon Master Clark Ashton Smith and all his heirs, who thought to pick  my brain and slip away, false fleeting agent of my old enemies. Upon him  the Long Death, the paramental agony! When he strays back as all men do.  The fulcrum (0) and the Cipher (A) shall be here, at his beloved 607  Rhodes.

In 1637, French mathematician Pierre de Fermat proposed, with respect to Pythagoras' equation: No whole number solutions exist when X and Y are  raised to whole number powers higher than two. This became Fermat's Last  Theorem / Fermat's Enigma.  Fermat claimed there was a proof, which the  margin of his notebook was too small to contain - unfortunately. <br />In 1955  Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama met at a mathematics symposium in Tokyo.  From that meeting arose what would become known as, The Taniyama-Shimura  Conjecture: All elliptical equations have a modular form. But by 1984, at  another mathematics symposium, this time in Oberwolfach ( a town in  Germany's black-forest), Gerhard Frey - by assuming that there was one  whole number solution to Fermat's Enigma - demonstrated how Fermat's Enigma  could be expressed as an elliptical equation. One without a corresponding  modular form. <br />And then, Andrew Wiles, a Cambridge mathematician working  in America, who specialised in matters relating to the Taniyama-Shimura  conjecture, and with an interest - from childhood - in Fermat's Enigma,  came along. The spur for Wiles was that the work done by Gerhard Frey cast  doubt upon the validity of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture. This was  problematic because Wiles' Ph.D. was in Elliptical equations and Modular  forms, a branch of mathematics that other areas of modern work depended  upon. And The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture like Fermat's Enigma had no  proof, but was taken to be probably true. So for Wiles, the principal aim  was to prove the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture from which he could also claim  to have proved Fermat's Enigma by contradicting Frey's proposition. This he  did  by 1995, after more than seven years of near solitary toil.<br />Calling  this book by the historically romantic title `Fermat's Enigma' as opposed  to the more correct, The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture, is a bit of a con,  but a necessary one for the popular market it is aimed at, and exposes  Wiles' work to an audience beyond the realms of mathematics professors.  <br />Wiles asserts that Fermat couldn't have had a proof, because the  required math didn't exist in 1637: the problem needed twentieth century  techniques. This makes sense due to the lack of a proof for over three  hundred and fifty years by many others' attempts. Yet why would Fermat have  lied? After all, Fermat is regarded as  being one of the finest  mathematicians there was. Maybe there is another way... someone?<br />Except for  the relentless use of &quot;However&quot;, and a little over indulgence on  dubious background detail, I found this book to be an excellent read. One  that should be an encouragement to those starting out in maths, and to  those who have a casual interest to study it more.	2000-03-16

This book's focus centres on the three Rhomandi brothers Deymorin, Mikhyel, and Nikaenour and how they eventually - by way of a burgeoning psychic awareness of one another and their animosity towards their great aunt Anheliaa's plans for extending and maintaining the city of Rhomatum's  influence upon neighbouring satellites of the Ley-web - discover that their  suspicions of one another have been ill-founded ( due to a long term  communication breakdown ), and that all three working together are a living  Ley-node.<br />The bedrock of this narrative is the usage of intense viewpoint  to convey the psychological and motivational aspects of the brothers'  concerns. Much is made of the Nikaenour character in respect to his own  view of Deymorin and Mikhyel, and as a hub by way of which Deymorin and  Mikhyel consider each other and Nikaenour, in conjunction with Anheliaa's  influence on all of them. But in the end though, Deymorin's misconceptions  about Mikhyel are probably the most poignant, as they have been the seed of  the brothers' mistrust of one another to greater and lesser extents.<br />As a  backdrop to all this is the city of Rhomatum, which was founded by the  brothers' ancestor Darius some three hundred years previously. A city born  from Darius' vision: `Today I looked into the rings and saw a new and  better world'. And so it was that Darius built a tower upon a leythium-node  wherein he set in motion a set of giant rings composed of leythium and  silver from which the power of Rhomatum was established: a power that is  the source of conflict between the resident ring-master Anheliaa and  everyone else.<br />A lot of the interconnections in this book are quite  understated by conventional standards, making the wheels-within-wheels  elements of the story a little hard to keep track of as the story evolves  and unwinds. I found it really had to be read at least twice to get a  better impression by way of hindsighted forewarning. Which for a book of  thislength is saying something, since from my point of view, it takes an  interesting and engaging one for me to read once.	2000-03-06

Set mostly within Lankhmar  - Above and Below - The Swords of Lankhmar is the obvious one here for maximum entertainment value, incorporating lots of great characters, F.L's passion for contact sports, and the Twains'  willingness to indulge in such, given opportunity - yet always ready to  defend Lankhmar, if coincident with their own interests. This is a book in  its own right, with a huge amount of detail and plot for a hair over two  hundred pages. A short mid section comprising a half dozen very short  stories, leads onto, The Frost Monstreme and Rime Isle ( two parts of a  novella, precursor to the fourth volume of the set, Farewell to Lankhmar).  Reviews that I have read regarding these last two stories describe them as  being below par, and drab. I don't agree with this at all. They  are of the  same quality as, The Swords of Lankhmar, except Lankhmar isn't much a part  of the picture, and the cast of characters aren't as dramatically  differentiated: No eight teated rat-queen (Hisvet), white-hot-wire whip  wielding mistress ( Samanda), invisible girl-ghoul ( Bonny-bones),  bat-carrier albatross, Glipkerio, Skwee, etc.  F. L's use of language, and  ability to integrate a lot of unlikely themes -  not so much the Twains'  use of weapons - are the primary factors, which make these stories work so  well today. I'm not saying that it's style over content, but without it,  they would come across as pulp adventure tales, for which they were geared  towards in the first place, and where in-depth character development was  inappropriate. So whilst the last two stories are, in essence, as good as  the first of the book, with respect to style and construction, they lack  colour due to the reduction in location and up-front character dynamics,  needing more of the character insight details as used in, The Mouser goes  Below (Farewell to Lankhmar ), to compensate.	1999-07-01

I  really enjoyed the Cloud of Hate - Lean Times..., and Stardock - The two best thieves... - and The Lords of Quarmall sections, of this second book of the series, more than the Adept's Gambit - and associated parts. All of it  was good, but the lastly mentioned - mid section - was rather contrived and  inconsistent in style, the thirty year gap in the creation of some of the  linking parts not helping. Maybe if they had been placed more strategically  they would have worked better in the overall scheme. Anyhow, the more  appealing sections are important, since elements from them are used  extensively as future references within the last two books of the series,  Return to Lankhmar, and Farewell to Lankhmar. So these must be read.	1999-06-21
US	49978572	R1Z5MUFJLOVITR	1565048946	934339135	Fritz Leiber's Ill Met in Lankhmar	Books	5	8	8	N	N	As sharp and as quick as the Twain's swords	Fritz Leiber packs more into one paragraph than most others take a chapter to, telling a story with depth, detail, and clarity, which makes the majority of today's fantasy - Sci - Fi offerings seem like overblown puff.  The story, Ill met in Lankhmar, takes a mere seventy three pages to do a  better job than what seems to require four to five hundred pages to achieve  nowadays, and with no benefit to the reader whatsoever. For further  demonstration, just read the first two pages of the Bazaar of the Bizarre -  a clever swipe at consumerism - for an even better example of F.L's  sophisticated, though economical style. There's so much said, so clearly,  in so very few pages. <br />The Bazaar of the Bizarre is said to be F.L's  favourite story, and from my perspective, I think it's because it has an  elan to the writing that carries through the entire piece, a quality he  manages to do for short spells only, in longer tales. The story itself  isn't  any better than the Snow Women, Ill met..., or the bulk of his others  - which in themselves carry a lot of future-use references - but it stays  very focused from the start to the finish of its thirty pages, as if it was  written in one - long - brain storming session.  <br />From, Induction:  `No  one at that moment could have guessed that The Gray Mouser was once named  Mouse, or that Fafhrd had recently been a youth whose voice was by training  high-pitched, who wore white furs only, and who still slept in his mother's  tent although he was eighteen.'	1999-06-21
US	49978572	R16GKSFFQJK3D1	1565049292	44565448	Farewell to Lankhmar, Vol. 4 (Lankhmar Series)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	A wonderful end to the series	This was the first Fritz Leiber book that I ever read, and titled as THE KNIGHT AND KNAVE OF SWORDS. C.J. Cherryh points out in an Interzone interview, that F.L. had a wonderful talent for delivering the contents of  his stories with such a sophisticated, slickness that you didn't know it  was coming till it happened. One of the better examples of this quality is  in the story, THE MOUSER GOES BELOW. There is a section where The Mouser is  privy to a pain and pleasure scene between the rat-queen, Hisvet, and her  two maids, threesie and foursie. At the climax to this, The Mouser, being  highly stimulated by the action is accosted by Death's sister, Pain, who  relieves him drop, by excruciating drop. It's the way that the Pain  character is reintroduced from earlier, and then used within a switch of  related contexts. The former being comically erotic, the latter, a piece of  pure horror. Sequences such as this, clearly demonstrate why F.L. was such  a highly awarded writer, as is detailed in the dust jacket.<br />My only gripe  with this publication is the omission of the last few pages that ended THE  CURSE OF THE SMALLS AND THE STARS in THE KNIGHT AND KNAVE OF SWORDS  version, which I was familiar with. I think it would have been more  complete with that addition, as it completes the story more agreeably,  instead of leaving it slightly hanging.	1999-06-18
