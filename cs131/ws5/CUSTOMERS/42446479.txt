I'm almost done finished reading this book and for 45 year old reader I'm really enjoying this read. Though I'm trying to figure out why so many so-called fantasy readers are so critical. Sure he's a young writer and undoubtedly will make errors and make mistakes,but why can't we as readers at least be a little more understanding,or if you can't be understanding DON'T BUY HIS BOOKS. I enjoyed Eragon and I love Saphira that's why I'm reading this book. Sure Eragon is screwing up if he didn't he wouldn't learn anything. I enjoyed this series a lot more than I ever did Harry Potter. Very few first time authors ever hit pay-dirt in success with readers,I'm sure Tolkien had his critics when he first wrote Lord of the Rings. I for one am glad to be reading this series and will continue to finish reading the third book wheb it comes out. I've read a lot of fantasy series some I've liked and lot I've haven't but please don't trash a young writer who's trying if you nay-sayers don't like his books let's see if you could do any better than Christopher. See how your first book would do with the critics.	2005-09-03

After hearing so much about Tiger Eye I decided to give this book a try. I'm really impressed with Marjorie's writting's. Hari and Dela are really a great team,but add the side characters like Artur and Dean, and  Blue a great team is in the works. She blends the fantasy and reality together in a beautiful way that is very enjoyable and sad. I'm looking forward to the next book called Shadowtouch with Artur. Wonder who the lucky girl will be. I also really enjoyed Dean can't wait for his as well. I highly recommend reading this book it's well done.	2005-08-28

True they have somewhat of a campy feel,but who wouldn't enjoy a good-looking Scotsman who would love you thru the ages. I've been waiting for Adam Black's book for a long time. Really enjoyed this one. Won't into a review because other people have. I was rooting for Gabrielle and Adam all the way thru. I highly recommend this book after you've read the earlier books in the series. If you try to read this one first you will be lost. Read this one you will enjoy it.

I look forward to this new series even more so than the Anita Blake series. Kim gets better with every book so far and I hope that she keeps on going. I won't go into great detail of this book but it was exciting from the first page on. We saw some break-ups, meaning Nick and Jenks,but I hope for Jenks only temporary,he is so good for Rachel. We also meet some new characters Ceri and Kisten.  And Rachel gets more aquainted with Trent and becomes a partner for David. I highly recommend this series if you love The Harry Dresdan Series and the Sookie Series. Read these books you will enjoy them.	2005-07-08

Picked this one up after reading some reviews and I'm glad I did. Katie Chandler working for a deadbeat boss is offered a position at Enchanted Inc.,a fun but wierd company. I forgot to mention that see Katie can see fairies,pixies and finally objects that move and have personalities all their own. I won't go into a great detail,but it has great sequel potential. I highly recommend this book really enjoyable,though has a slow start. I heard that there is a sequel in the works. Read this book it's very enjoyable.	2005-07-05

I've been waiting to read this book after not really enjoying the last few books in this series. I am so glad that I picked this book up. A laughfest from pg.1, I eagerly dove into this book and just finished it. Will not go into a synopsis of this book because so many others have,but I enjoyed this book and to me it's one of my favorites. Sweet Sally makes a comeback,Grandma Mazure is at her funniest,Lula is a riot and Stephanie loses another two cars and gets kidnapped,just like old times. I know that sometimes these books have a way repeating each other, but so far I have enoyed all but two of the series. And the best of all is Ranger and Joe Morelli two of the hottest hunks and the suspense builds between both. Who will Stephanie end up with? Knowbody knows. I highly recommend this enjoyable book.	2005-06-23

For some reason after reading Blue Dalhia I lost interest in this series, to me this was Nora's weakest book. When this book came out I was skeptical, but this story was about Roz a woman around my age so I picked it up and just finished reading it. What a difference in this book,the story was so much better and exciting, and the characters were more in tune with each other. Mitch was a great partner for Roz,and Amelia had so much more of a personality and a story yet to be told. I learned not to judge that one book would make a new series weak,and I'm looking forward to reading Red Lily. Harper and Hailey will be great couple as well. Yes,go ahead and read this book you will enjoy it and it had some great scary scenes as well.	2005-06-08

After receiving this book I ran into the only private place I could find and eagerly tore into this book. BRAVO Katie, I think that this book was better than the last one. The characters were better fleshed out in this one and we got to meet some new characters. Jim, was very funny in this one and Rene was sweet and as helpful as ever. Unfortunatlly Aisling and Drake ended this book on a sour note,but I'm sure that Katie will be getting back together. I highly recommend this series and will be eagerly awaiting for the next one in this fantastic series.	2005-05-11

After reading Master of the Night and reading the short novella from Bite I decided to give Angela another try. This book to me was so much better than Master of the Night,Lyr and Diana were so good together that I had sort of wished that they teamed together in Law Enforcement. This book blended the sex theme and the conflict theme in a more balanced way. I'm not sure what her next book is about but I highly recommend this book.	2005-05-08

Picked this book with another book that I had been anxious to read and did'nt regret it. Despite it's faults this book was fun read. It had it's faults, slow spots,and somtimes the characters seemed to drag,and other times some scenes just didn't make sense. But to me this one of Julie's early works and ties very with her God series,meaning we see more of Deena and Hoop,they held the book together for me. I highly recommend this cute read if you just want to get away and see how our feline friends see us wierd humans.	2005-05-02

I have been eagerly waiting for a long time and after a few days reading I will have to another two years to find out what happens in Merry's fascinating world. I will not go into a big synopsis of this book but I will say that the way is clearing up for Merry getting pregnant and for being the new Queen. Andais is finally finding out who may be a better ruler for her people the Fae and the Ravens are slowly thinning out. They're are a lot of confusing situations that have to be cleared up,and I can't wait to see how they are solved. I do not have a favorite Raven, I love all of her guys. I highly recommend only reading this book after you've read all the earlier books in this series because if you don't you will be greatly confused.

Had this book on reserve at my library to see if I wanted to buy this book in paperback,but the jury is still out on this idea. I had trouble getting into the begining of this book because I had trouble sympathizing with Lily. To me she just didn't seem be the sympathetic kind of character that she should be. The other problem was Lucas Swain. I could not get into him as a hero type. He was not at all like Sam Donovan or Ben Lewis her other main male characters. After the first 100pgs. or so the book finally picked up and took off for me. Of all of her books to me this book was her weakest,not her worst just weakest. I'm still planning on reading her book coming out in June it looks good. I'm not sure if I can recommend this book you will just have to read it to find out.	2005-04-09

Bought this book a few days ago and even with the big pgs. count found it quite easy to get through. Clare Kimball is coming back to Emmitsville MD. after a difficult past. Equally interesting is Cam Rafferty the sheriff. Weird murders are taking place in this small town and Clare everyone thinks has the answer to them. Granted this book is not a typical Nora book,but I found it quite fascinating and enjoying Nora's new style of the occult and paganism. I can see why a lot of people don't like this book because of the sexual violence of women and other people,but I think in this book you have to look beyond this view to see the outcome. Yes,the romance and quirky humor is still there,but toned down for seriousness of the book. I really enjoyed this book,but if your not into sexual rape and murder don't read this book. I love reading about horror and the supernateral so this not affect me very much. I also think that people get creeped out being that this book to place in a very small town and a lot of people knew each other for years.	2005-03-06

After re-reading the first book I was eager to read this book and see Jenks and his children and the rest of the gang. After finishing this book I think that she has a great set-up for future books in this series. After totally hating Trent in the first book I find that he may not be as he seems and in a way really likes Rachel. Glenn the new agent is cool and he looks to be a future partner for Rachel and love interest,MAYBE. Ivy, to me is a really cool person and is really trying to find way to get along with Rachel,and finally Nick, not sure what to think with him yet. She finally gets to solve a very confusing murders of five young witches and along the learns that things are not as they seem. Really enjoyed Jenks and his family and want to see more of them.

Harry finally finds out more about his family and secrets about his mother that he never knew. Things also heat up for Karin Murphy a detective and Harry.

I also hope that Jim plans to bring Susan back she prove to be a valuable friend and allie to Harry in the future.

Before when reading The Gift and Castles I was sort of not sure about earlier events but Guardian Angel answered all my questions. I was really surprised about who Pagan really was and now I know. Cain and Jade were delightful characters and easy to get into. Nathan and Colin were also delightful,but to me their Uncle Harry broke the mold he was really fun and easy to get to know. I will not go into detail of the story because we all know it,but it will go on my keeper shelf with the other three. I also forgot to mention Lyon and Christina,loved seeing them as well.

He really made an impression on me and I had to find out about him. This book was really enchanting and Alesander was maybe a little naive but being raised in a convent she would have been very sheltered and loved. I will go into detail of this book because so many people have,but I will say that it was a wonderful follow-up to The Gift. I'm so happy that Colin and Alesander found a deep and unbounding love for each other. Really enjoyed the humor and slight mystery tones as well. Read this book I highly recommen it.

Devin's story was sort of expected, I knew that Cassie would be his from very early on, I was just waiting for how Nora would play out Joe Dolin her former husband, for some reason his story was not my favorite. Shane's story saved the book, I loved how she played the Civil War theme with Rebecca a para-psychologist. I enjoyed Shane and Rebecca.

Found this book yesterday and just finished it and I really enjoyed this one better than the first one. She seemed more comfortable blending her characters together and their interacting was so much better. I really enjoyed Allie and also seeing Joy, Christian, Rapheal, and especially Roxie. Also loved the six ghosts they all had such personalities, Esme was my favorite. I highly recommend this sequel,you will enjoy it, I would say to read the first book in the series first,but not necessary because Katie describes them so well. More excitement and action and finally humor to round it nicely. Read it and enjoy, Katie please hurry with the next one.	2004-03-10

I just recieved this book a few days ago and threw myself into my own private space and devoured this book in a short time. Enjoyable, sad,funny and enthralling emotions with Merry and her Ravens. After reading this book,my respect went up for Andais the Queen of Darkness. She now understands Merry and respects her,and maybe hoping that Merry will be Cel. I think also she knows what Cel could do to the Fae and what horrors could come to pass. This book is now my favorite in the series,and have one question. How long before BOOK#4 comes out? I can't wait to see what happens next with Merry and her growing GUARDS and even making friends and more enemies. I highly recommend this series.	2004-02-07

I read the first book of this series over a year ago, and enjoyed it immensely. I never read the second,one, but when I read this book I felt really good about how Anne reviewed the second book. She explained how all the Fae and the witches had worked together and even continue to work together to destroy the THE DESTRCTOR, a man who hated witches so much, and detested magic of any kind. He created NIGHTFLYERIERS, a hated combo of both. Now the Characters, all great ,even though I had a confusing time remembering both I finaly caught on and rooted for all of them. But I wanted to know if Jean was ever caught she was mentioned again, and finally Dianne, and Lucian the Light-Bringer, and Moon Goddess. I sort of felt for him, I think he truly loved Ari but he didn't know to tell her,and finally Dianne did she finally find what she was looking for? My only question of this series.  I'm going to get a hold of the second book series soon and catch up. I highly recommend this fantasy series, it's great.	2004-01-29

Nora has a wonderful way of bringing her trilogies to a conclusion. Zoe and Brad were well paired thru this book. Simon, her son became more endearing to me in this book, and even Crystal McCourt Zoe's mother came around at the end. Zoe called on to find the final Key to liberate the sleeping ladies finally finds it and ends up killing Kane as well. It couldn't have a happier ending.

This book happily arrived at my door not long after it came out from Amaz. I literally devoured this book in almost one night,and finally finished it the next morning. I thought Zarek's story so far the saddest of the group,but it ends happily with Zarek being pronounced innocent of all of his crimes. Astrid, the judgement Nymph happily falls for him, I think from the begining she had doubts of his guilt and that made her more determined to find the truth. The cast of amazing characters shines through in this book, but my favorite had to be Simi. She was an absolute delight, and I want so see more of her. Jesse, one of the Dark-Hunters also shows up. I happily recommend this series and to let you know that it's humorous and often times sad,but also always has a good ending. I can't wait until April when Wulf's story comes out. Read and enjoy.	2003-12-08

I bought this book after reading some wonderful, and poor reviews about this book, and I have to say that after reading this wonderful book  that I agree with the wonderful reviews. A story about a young man Eragon who finds a dragon's egg that hatches into Saphira a beautiful flying dragon. Started off sort of slow,but picked up when Brom joined them on their journey. I will not go into every detail of the book as it so long, but to me if your looking for a slow magical read that involves elves, trollls dwarfs and other magical creatures give this book a try. I am anxiously awaiting for The Eldest, second in this 3 book series. To the people who critisized it because of McCaffrey's Dragon Series, this book is different a kind of Dragon Riders, they are in magical world, not a distant planet in Space. And for those peolple who are dis-heartend by the Harry Potter give this book a try as well.	2003-12-05

Beside her stands Jordan Hawke, a writer who was Dana's former lover who left her to become a writer, who came back to lay claim back home. I enjoy this book even more than Key of Light and that book is hard to beat. I enjoy the ineractions that the characters have together especially Zoe's and Brad's comments to each other. Also Moe the dog makes his apperances and Simon, Zoe's young son also plays a bigger part. New characters also make it interesting. Can't wait for Key of Valor,when Zoe will have to find the third Key. I know Brad and the others will also have a bigger part in this book of series. I know it will be exciting.

I've been so anxious to read this book, basically because of Kenyon's story, but all the stories were good. Darkfest the first one is my first reading for Amanda and all around sweet story about Channa a blind girl who can see only when she holds onto the wulfs tail who turns out to be Darfest. Phantom Lover by Kenyon was my favorite V'Aiden a Dreamhunter who falls for Erin a mortal and can't live without her. A sad story,but very happy ending. To me the sweetest part was when she was so down on herself and she asked him &quot;Why Me&quot; you know I'm not beautiful and he showed her the mirror and said &quot;This is how I see you&quot; what a beautiful statement to say to her.  Maggie's story Under her Spell is also a first time author for me,and it is also a sweet story sort of similar to Phantom Lover because both women have to save their guys or lose them,I will not divulge any more you will have to read it. The final story by Rhonda Thompson A Wulf's Curse was good read but to me the waekest. I just couldn't get into Elise and Sterling. I highly recommend this book not just to read Kenyon's story but all of them. READ and ENJOY.....................	2003-11-04

I've never read any of her books before, and I was pleasantly surprised, and pleased with  this book. Lawless Lily as she was known to men and all of England was a rebel,who shocked her society with her wild ways. She gambled and took dangerous risks. She was bound and deterimed to stop her sister Penny from marrying Lord Alex Raiford a powerful and rich man. Alex on the otherhand thought Lily was a fascinating woman to him, and he was determined to tame her and bend her to his will. There was a lot more to Lily that really made her endearing to me and to find out you will just have to read the book. The side characters were also excellently portrayed, just all-around fun read. Now I'm off to read the sequel called Dreaming of You.	2003-10-22

I read the first one in this series called Kiss and Tell, could not sympathize with Marnie, and Jake for some reason I had trouble sympathizing with him as well. Kyle and Delainie, I could enjoy and let the story take me to the jungle. She was acting in the best interest for her sister and family, Kyle had always loved her and when they met again sparks flew.  Also enjoyed the plot and how it took Kyle and Delainie to new heights of love and trust. Enjoyed the sex scenes as well. I'm so glad that in a way she dumped her family to be with Kyle and let him take care of her for a change. An all around exciting read. Is the next one good as well.	2003-10-06

I really felt for Shannon, she lost her Step-Father in one year and in the next she lost her mother Amanda she was sort of lost and bitter. Now she finds out that she has two sisters Maggie and Brianna living in Ireland and the worst news is thather original father was from Ireland. I fell in love with three of the sisters as they made Shannon feel at home,and she also discovers how to love in a young man named Murphy Muldoon a farmer. I also loved the legend that went with this story as well,to me it just seemed right with the many legends in Ireland. I highly recommend this book as well as the whole series. I will be reading more of Nora's books. I think that she is a master in the Romance of her books.	2003-09-25

This book spans 56yrs. of finding diamonds that have been lost in time.

The second part is 56 yrs.later and Shannon Gannon,granddaughter of Max and Laine is thrown into a murder and Eve Dallas is on the case. I loved this book it has everything. I wish more had been mentioned about Laine's Dad I thought he was cool. I highly recommend this bookif you are a Nora fan or Eve Dallas's In-Death books and you don't have to read all 17-books to enjoy it. Read it and enjoy.	2003-09-22

But I'm reading this series backwards. Every good series that I start I do this. Julian is a Dark-Hunter, and Amanda is witch and a sensitive.I love these characters one is an ageless souless vampire and Amanda comes from a family of witches and it's funny because she wants normalcy in life,but when Julian attacks her thinking that she is Tabitha,her twin sister and handcuffs them together everything goes from bad to worse. I won't say anymore about the story because I think that you have to experience the story, I will only say that once you do read it you will want to read the series and enjoy all of the Dark-Hunters and how they find their true mates. I highly recommend this series, I'm already hooked because Zarek's story is al-ready pre-ordered. Read this book, you will enjoy.	2003-09-18

The first one To Kiss in the Shadows was about a young woman Lianne who was partially disfigured. She finds love in a man who thought that she could never have. The second An Interrupted Tapestry was also well done,but I wish it had been a bit longer. The third,and my favorite Dragonswan written by Kenyon was to me the best of the whole group, I wish that a novel had been written about these two Channon and Sebastian were so good together,I just wish that it had been longer. The final story was very good,Into the Dreaming. Loved the Fairie King and Queen and the young man called Vengance was also a very dreamy and tortured young who finds love again in Jane a young woman from the future who did not belong there. I highly recommend this anthology, but if your like me you will wish that all the stories were longer.	2003-09-16

Julie Carlson is afraid her husband is having an affair and hires Mac or (Debby) as she called him to spy on him to find out if her assumption is true. After this turn of events everything goes out of control for both of them. But to me my favorite character would have to be Josaphine, Mac's little Toy Poodle. I enjoyed her personality, and spunk,and at the end she jumps in and nearly saves both of their lives by attacking Bast one of the bad guys. I really enjoyed this book and will enjoy reading more of her books. I already have Beachcomber in my List at home waiting for me. I highly recommend this book. Read it and enjoy.	2003-08-31

The first one by Christine Feehan is my absolute favorite Magic in the Wind about a group of seven sisters and their adventures. This one is out Sarah the oldest and her relationship with Damon her soon to be lover. The second Hot August Moon by Katherine Sutcliff was to me the hardest one to get into. I think of the four this one was the weakest for me, I also think that because it was pre-equal to her book Bad Moon Rising I may have just not connected with it. The third was by Fiona Brand After was also to me a very interesting read. The final story by Eileen Wilks Only Human is my second favorite. Lily reminds me of a very naive Anita Blake and Rule who is a very hunky and good looking werewolf has a real interest in Lily who is a detective looking into several murders. A very likable and interesting story. I hope that these four get together again and do another anthology. Maybe a continuation of these stories. Please Christine write more of 7 sisters stories,and Eileen a continuation of Lily and Rule. Please.....................	2003-08-12

Well actually I would give it 3 1/2 stars only because of one of the stories I could not warm up to. The first story was excellent,Vaness and Brady Tucker were easy to like characters I gave it 4 stars. The second one with Lainie and Dillon only 2,why, because they were not easy to like characters. I had a difficult time warming up to them, and also a complete reversal to the first story. The final story Mind over Matter was to me the best of the three I can see an early begining to her witch series and the Donavon Series. All an all a better group of stories than her last Dangerous series. I still think that she is great and you should give this book a try.	2003-05-15

I bought this book at my store, and lo, and behold my other hardback arrived the same day so it took me over a week to read it. Callie is an excellent heroine and Jake a perfect gentleman'through in couple of confused and broken up parents, one who gave her birth,and the ones who raised her, and finally a few confusing bad guys and you have an excellent story. The only wish that I could make for this<br />would have more one on one with Callie and or Jessie as she was originally and her parents. I was hoping that Nora would include a final chapter on how she was relate to all four of her new family. I also loved how her two mothers responded to each. If you love reading Nora's book this one is a keeper.	2003-04-12

Actuall,I would give this book 41/2 stars if the ratings would allow. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars would be Edward. I wish in the next book that they are teamed together and he has to come to terms with her increasing num. of men that are in her group. Musette was fantastic and wierd as usual the two small children vampires Valentina and Bartolome could be valuable assets to Anita and Jean-Claud in future books when the Vampire Council comes into town. I'm really unhappy about Richard I hope that he can come to terms with all his issues and once more become part of the tri. But I'm reall glad that Jason finally got a major part in this story he is also one of my favorites. I also hope that Dolph can learn to accept Anits's new lifestyle or they will always be at odds. Good book, read and enjoy you will be glad that you did. I just hope that she hurries up with the next book. I can't wait.	2003-04-08

I gave up reading Romance because they did have what I was looking for until I picked up my first Nora Roberts book, Blue Bayou, after that I was hooked. I bought this book because I am very intrigued by the wiccan culture and this book did not disapoint. I see these three women Mia, Ripley and Nell like a more grown-up version of the Charmed series. This book is about my favorite character Mia she is so strong in her powers, and a new character Sam Logan,her former lover who came back after eleven years. Of course, all my favorites are in the story to. I would like Nora to do a series sequel on the daughters of these three wonderful and lovely women and very sexy and gorgeous men that they married.	2002-12-04

This book is about two lonely people Alec the the cold hard lord of Belmore and the sweet young bumbling witch Joyous MacQuarrie, who tugged at his heartstrings and made his organised boring world go crazy. The adventures they have are hilarious and yet in a way very sad. If you are looking for a keeper in a book read this one.

I read several low reviews and I decided to give it a shot. I really enjoyed this book, the whole protector of the Allience was an interesting take on the Vampire and Werewolf genre. Tara and Ann are cousins and both are grandaughters to Jacques DeVant a now American and French protector. Ann sends for Tara her American cousin and both girls are thrown into a whole new situation. I have never read her earlier books so I never met Lucian or Jade,two very interesting indiviuals but Brent was a very hunky and interesting person, and I'm so glad that he and Tara got together at the end.

Eve Dallas is in her element and closing in on the culprits and and taking everyone in and justice is served or is it? My favorite of the series so far. Purity justice served or more vicious killing by a virus that is spread to its victim online, this raises a moral issue  and very emotional to Eve for past and present. All my favorite characters are in this one, and finally Mavis reappers and in a very big and futuristic way and brings a surprising announcement to Eve,I loved how Eve reacts to this. Will Portrait have more of Mavis,I hope because she is one of my favorits. I missed a lot Summerset and Eve's constant bickering, but I know he will be back. Read this book, you will not be disappointed. These characters are all like family to me.	2002-09-02

I enjoyed reading about Bubbles,she has a more realistic way of seeing things then StephaniePlum. I know we can compare them, there are some similarities, but their are some differences, one her teenage daughter Jane who will back up her mother and two Stilleto who is me is more devoted to Bubbles than Joe Morelli is to Stephanie. When I first started the book I did not think much of Bubbles- Hairdresser-to trying to become a reporter, but by the end of the book I really started to like her and her circle of friends to me in a way they are more realistic of how a real person starts to become to better themselves and know that they want to do more and help people out. I will be reading her new sequel when it comes out in paperback. Keep on writing Sarah you have potential.	2002-08-30

I ordered this book from Amazon because it looked very interesting and this book and this book did not fail me.Kim is a very detailed author but she also can bring horror to a very creepy level. It took me a while to get into her rythme and her style but once I got past figuring out who was who I enjoyed it very much.Lisa is a young reincarnation of Elizabeth a witch who was a young friend to Gilbert a very powerful warlock or wizard, who reincarnated person is David who kidnapped Karin his young pregnant wife and was torturing her. The story gradually built up to a very  satisfying and horrifying  conclusion that left me wanting more. I really felt for Mirabel because she died never knowing if her baby girl ever knew the whole story, and also for Liam, Lisa's boyfriend who left Lisa never knowing what Lisa had been suffering. This book was, but depressing because everyone was alone,dead and suffering. I would like Kim to write a sequel to this book.	2002-08-09

As alway old and new characters played well with the new characters. Her love life has also become more complicated because I think that Stephanie is very enamored of Ranger but also still has feelings for Joe Morelli. Stephanie whatever guy you decide to be with I would love to be with the other. Keep on writing Janet  you have a brand new fan to read your books.	2002-06-27

After reading this book I really felt for Fran, that poor young woman was ripped in half by the one man that she really loved, and by one Calder Hart who really wants her, but knows that she will never love him. I wanted to rip Bragg's wife arms off how could she be so mean to Fran,when she does not love him either, she only wants to use him so he can reach his political glory and then more than likely drop him just so she can get more money out of him.  Sorry, I had to get that off my chest.  The only reason that I gave this book four stars was because I do not remember her solving the case of who ripped Sally's paintings up.

This is the first book of Dara's that read and I have to say that I was very impressed by this story. The characters Jorlan, and GreenTamryn were geniune and caring and seemed to me like real people of the future in a new world when men have lost their power and rely on very powerful women to buy and protect and finally find love with each other. Jorlan and Green had this love and respect, and by the end of the story she found herself an equal to herself. The side characters were good to. The only fault I had was trying to get all the words in the glossery down. I'm still trying to understand who exactly where the Kloo and the Klee and what kind of animals they were. This will not be the last of Dara Joy for me.	2002-04-12

Francesca Cahill is refreshingly new and very young woman who is trying to become a detective in the very early twentieth century. Back at that time there were no computers and other fancy gadgets to help solve crimes. I enjoyed her enthusiasm and her wit and her determination to help the people who came to her for help. Also, I enjoyed the minor characters, Connie, and her brother who both came to her for advice, but Bragg reminded me so much of Roarke in the Eve Dallas series. I might read the next book in the series. I hope that Brenda continues to develope both Francesca and Bragg and to see if she becomes the detective that she wants to be so much.	2002-03-21

The book was very boring at first, but when I got thru the first 100 pgs. it started to get very good. First, you have Miriam Blaylock, the last vampire of her species,then Paul Ward the ultimate vampire slayer. The story goes back and forth between the two until they come together at her Dance Bar. Then they come together to form a union and concieve a child. The ending totally surprised me and I was glad at the end when Miriam and her friends got away. This book is not as good some other vampire stories, I would like him to write a sequel about Miriam and her son and to see who is more powerful ,Paul Ward slayer, and Miriam Blaylock the ultimate last Vampire of her kind and who will have their son.	2002-03-05

I have all her O'Malley books up but excluding her newest book that was just published. All her Skye books were great up to her book Wild Jasmine,after that I only bought the books to keep up with the series. When I read Darling Jasmine I could not believe her to be the same woman that she portrayed in a Love for all Time. She forgot all of her own children,grandchildren and focused on one Jasmine. I wanted to here about her other grandchildren,but I guessed that if she had done that the series would never have been completed. This book and her earlier ones are my favorites in this series. I hope that in her next book that she writes about Fortune and her family and how Skye's family did in the new colonies. But I'm rambling now, but I just wanted to say that I have had this book since it came out in the eighties and I still have the book ,creased but in good shape and I still read it.	2002-03-04

This is the first book I ever read by Tami. Since then I have five of her other books, but by far this book is my favorite by her, but a few things still bother me. I really felt for Angie in this book, the contact that Kate had with her was fantastic Angie really fell hard for Kate. At the end of the book I was shocked when she almost might have killed her but she did not, the trust and the love that had kept it from happening. But, I also felt that Angie was reduced to being one that was considered part of the plot. I wish that Tami would write a sequel about Angie.	2002-02-21

I read this book over 5 years ago when my daughter was to little to read this series. I love horses,but there are no horse series or books for the adults. When I read how Brad Townsend wast treating this filly I became very angry and wanted to do the same to him. Since I bought this book and I bought some of the other books in this series, but I have not bought any more, or enjoyed the series because of new authors or new people that I lost interest in.	2002-02-13

She has wonderful way of describing her characters that I really love. Her writing may be rough in a lot of ways, but she has the ability to get you into her way,so to speak. I do not compare her to Anita at all and I think I would be foolish to do so, because she is a totally differant person.<br />  Merry is an older person than Anita and little wiser because she is more secure in many ways, but in many ways the same. I also love all the men her new series as in Anita I did not think that Richard was her type. Anita also questions herself about becoming a monster. Merry knows that when you stop asking questions to yourself you have become a monster. I am anxiously awaiting the sequel \\"Caress of Twilight\\" to see Merry and her gents get along....	2002-02-11

She is a fantastic cop and he the entrepenure. All the minor characters Feeny,Mavis,Peabody,and espically Summerset and Mcnab all work so<br />well together. I find myself hoping that Peabody and Mcnab get serious even though Eve is not crazy about that situation. I hope that a child is not going to show up for another year,I want Eve to find a member of her real family that left her,and come to terms with her childhood. She will be a better mother knowing more of her situation and childhood and know where she will be going. I am looking forward to her next book,and I have all of her series ,and I love her books.	2002-02-11

Anita has proven herself time and time again to her friends, her wereleopard pard, Richard, Jen Claude, and her numerous other friends and co-workers. There was a lot of sexual situations, but she was under the influence after being exposed to a very tough situations. That shouldn't cloud your views on the plot or characters. I personally loved the book, it is my second favorite in the series. The only fault of the book was that I would like to see more new, different, genres of changelings or monsters, or witches, or any new characters. I would like to see Anita and Elizabeth, the wereleopard, make peace with each other. But, no matter what, I enjoyed and loved the series, and will continue to read it. I would recommend this book to the anyone who has read this series from the beginning, so they would understand it.	2002-02-09
