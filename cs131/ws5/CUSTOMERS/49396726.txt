Philip Roth is funnier and raunchier and just as intelligent, but there is something to be said for Bellow's gently mannered style, the methodical serenity in which he mines his academic knowledge to put the chaos of the era hopefully into an enlightening context.   <br /> <br />Bellow's avatar in \\"Mr. Sammler's Planet\\" is Artur Sammler, an Oxford-educated septuagenarian Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust, supported himself as a journalist, and now rents an apartment from his niece Margotte in the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  Besides occasionally lecturing at Columbia, he spends his waning years coping with the remnants of his family: Shula, his nutty daughter, allowed to hide in a convent to escape the Nazis for the price of being instilled with a Catholic identity; Elya Gruner, his nephew, in the hospital for an aneurysm; Gruner's daughter Angela, a tramp, and son Wallace, a brilliant young man who can't decide on a future for himself, instead submerged in gambling debts and contemplating dubious business schemes.  <br /> <br />This novel, published in 1970, is in a sense Bellow's entry into the Space Age, and as such there are several references to the manned lunar missions and a long discussion about the universe between Sammler and an Indian biophysicist named Govinda Lal, whose manuscript Shula has stolen.  It is typical of Bellow the essayist to inject his philosophical musings into a fictional narrative by way of a dialogue between two intellectuals, and it is topical of Bellow the novelist to try to connect Sammler to the era of space exploration by assigning him a friendship with the late H.G. Wells, one of the first people to write about interplanetary travel.  <br /> <br />One day a black pickpocket whom Sammler has caught in the act corners him in the vestibule of his apartment building and exhibits his virility as though to assert his superiority over the meek elderly white man, his power to take and do whatever he wants.  While Moses Herzog would have responded by writing a letter to Genghis Khan or some such person, Sammler can do nothing but ponder the sheer absurdity of the human condition and the strangeness of the civilizations it has created.  Invoking William Blake, he regards New York, with its cosmopolitan wealth and social permissiveness fostering a new brand of lawlessness, as a city of \\"dark satanic mills changing into light satanic mills.\\"   <br /> <br />Bellow's novels tend to be thematically very similar to each other--a man, typically Jewish, middle-aged or older, overeducated but underemployed, examines his life through the prism of his current environment--but each marks a recognizable step in the American zeitgeist.  Sammler is not much of a presence in his own novel, let alone on his planet; but he is an important, if minor, component of the figurative Bellow persona, the whole of which is greater than the sum of its parts.   <br />	2005-08-04

For example, there is nothing remotely modest about what he proposes in \\"A Modest Proposal,\\" which is that Irish people who are starving because of English economic policies should remedy their situation by eating their own children, boasting the added benefit of reducing the number of \\"papists.\\"  Like an eighteenth-century George Carlin, Swift is funny just for the blatant outrageousness of his words, but there is also a truthful undercurrent in much of what he says. <br /> <br />Swift, hereditarily an Englishman born in Dublin who became an Anglican minister and who was eventually sent back to Dublin--\\"exiled\\" as he called it--for the remainder of his life, made himself a mouthpiece for the Irish people and a gadfly to any authorities who he felt overstepped their bounds.  In his \\"Drapier\\" letters, he warns the Irish not to take any wooden nickels; that is, to reject the base-metal currency being foisted upon them by the English in order to scuttle their economy.  In his poem on \\"The Legion Club\\" he hurls hilarious verbal salvos at members of the Irish Parliament who are selling out to the English, caricaturing them as monsters and demons.  <br /> <br />\\"A Tale of a Tub\\" goes everywhere, but the main narrative thread is an allegory of the Reformation.  Three brothers, Peter, Martin, and Jack, inherit a fortune from their father and proceed to conquer the world, but entrapment by the vices (personified as women) incites them to squabble and results in a schism in which Martin (Luther) and Jack (John Calvin) leave Peter (the Roman church) for their own haunts.  Interspersed throughout this tale are playful swipes at literary critics and pedants, including a fantasy on the professional windbags known as the Aeolists.  Harold Bloom has called \\"A Tale of a Tub\\" the best prose work in the English language, and furthermore has said that he reads it on a regular basis to punish himself, which I think speaks volumes even if you don't value Bloom's opinion. <br /> <br />Religion is naturally one of Swift's concerns.  He generally likes it, but he has the sensibility to say, \\"We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another.\\"  He advocates religious sobriety; in the \\"Mechanical Operation of the Spirit\\" he ridicules fanatics who claim to be able to communicate with God.  His \\"Argument Against Abolishing Christianity\\" offers solid rationale for preserving the institution, one reason being that the criticism of it is the only forum which allows certain writers to exercise their rhetorical talents.    <br /> <br />This edition also contains a short list of Swift's epigrams, at least one of which has achieved some notoriety: \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\"  Mostly these are observations of human nature and its folly, and while not all may resonate, some are surprisingly timeless: \\"It is a miserable thing to live in suspense; it is the life of a spider.\\"  Remember that the next time you decide to buy a lottery ticket. <br /> <br />	2005-07-28

Taking place in Tokyo in the years following the Russo-Japanese war and just before the first world war, it has the atmosphere of a richly detailed nineteenth-century epic with an almost Tolstoyan sense of national history and the scope and melodrama of a Stendhalian romance.  Appropriately, one of its themes is the gradual influx of Western influence on Japanese culture, which Mishima, himself loyal to the Samurai tradition, might well have resisted.   <br /> <br />Most of the novel's characters are members of the aristocratic society of imperial Japan.  One of these is Kiyoaki, the eighteen-year-old son of the Marquis Matsugae, a noble of the royal court.  Kiyoaki is a handsome boy who attracts many girls but is too sullen and withdrawn to make many friends at school; as it is, his only companion is a bright classmate named Shigekuni Honda who works hard to please his strict parents by studying law.  Kiyoaki has a tutor named Iinuma who secretly disrespects his pupil because he feels that Kiyoaki, representing the moral decadence of the new era, dishonors his ancestors and the dignity of old Japan.  There are also two Siamese princes who through diplomatic channels are acquainted with the Matsugaes and attend Kiyoaki's school; they make a comical duo, at least until the tragedy that calls them home to Siam.   <br /> <br />The story pertains mainly to the troubled love affair between Kiyoaki and Satoko, the daughter of Count Ayakura, whose family is close to the Matsugaes and lives on a nearby estate.  Kiyoaki and Satoko were playmates in childhood, so it is no surprise that adolescence has brought mutual romantic feelings.  However, her assertive and unsubmissive attitude offends his pride; he cannot envision her as his wife.  After he spurns her, she accepts a marriage proposal from Prince Harunori Toin, a high-ranking military officer; the engagement is formalized by receiving official authorization from the Imperial Household Ministry.   <br /> <br />Satoko, aware that Prince Harunori is a dispassionate drone, consents to continue seeing Kiyoaki, their trysts aided and abetted by Honda and her maidservant Tadeshina, until one day when she wakes up with morning sickness.  Imagine the imminent scandal--a young lady soon to be a princess in a marriage sanctioned by the Empire, pregnant by another man before her wedding!  How could she be so irresponsible, and how could Kiyoaki have such contempt for imperial honor?  This volatile situation involving the reputations of both the Matsugae and the Ayakura families advances the story to a nearly Shakespearean plateau, particularly when Satoko, heeding Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, gets herself to a (Buddhist) nunnery.  Kiyoaki's desperate effort to visit her in the convent during the unseasonable weather indicated in the title ends the novel with a delicate poignancy.       <br /> <br />\\"Spring Snow\\" is a masterly composition that portrays a picturesque Japan in transition from the grand ceremoniousness of the imperial aristocracy to the new Europeanized etiquette.  The wealthy Japanese are teaching English in their schools, driving British cars, wearing British clothes, listening to German music on German gramophones, even celebrating Christmas without ostensibly observing Christianity.  Mishima, perhaps identifying himself with the discontented Iinuma, may have seen this as cultural degeneration, but his chronicle implies nothing disastrous about the beginning of the century in which his country, bolstered by the prosperity of its elite, was to become a world power.    <br /> <br />	2005-07-26

Stanislaw Lem's novel \\"Solaris\\" proposes a challenging scenario--what if we contacted a life form whose intelligence was of a kind to which we not only could not relate, but which would prove to be a formidable, even hostile, opponent in our attempt to understand it? <br /> <br />As conceived by Lem, the planet Solaris is an intriguing celestial body.  It is a satellite of not one but *two* solar systems, revolving about a red sun and a blue sun, and most of its surface is covered with a single ocean comprising a substance not quite water but a kind of plasma.  Astronomers on Earth have been studying Solaris for generations and have launched several manned missions, some dangerous and fatal, to the planet to collect data.  Electrical and magnetic impulses emitted by the ocean and the many dramatic physical phenomena it exhibits hint that it is some form of life with some form of intelligence.  Could a creature whose body mass is several hundred billion tons of liquid actually be alive?  If so, how was it born, and can it die? <br /> <br />The novel's human protagonist, a psychologist named Kris Kelvin, arrives at a space station (called simply the Station) hovering above the planet to study the \\"mind\\" of the ocean.  He joins two other scientists, a secretive \\"cyberneticist\\" named Snow and a paranoid physicist named Sartorius, the only other humans on the Station, or so it seems at first.  Other creatures, whether hallucinations or realities Kelvin cannot tell, roam the corridors like ghosts; one of them is a girl named Rheya whom Kelvin once loved and who committed suicide a long time ago.  Additionally, Kelvin's former mentor, Gibarian, has recently died under mysterious circumstances at the Station; was one of these creatures somehow responsible for his death?  <br /> <br />What the scientists suspect, but--awed by an entity far more sophisticated than they had imagined--are reluctant to acknowledge directly, is that these apparitions are being created and projected by the ocean, which is psychically tapping into their brains to retrieve their memories.  Is the ocean some kind of god, testing its powers on the mortals who have come to visit it, even while they are testing their own powers on it?  \\"Solaris\\" gradually reveals itself as a philosophical allegory, a cosmic fable about man's struggle to understand and interpret the universe.  <br /> <br />Lem writes passages of astounding scenic beauty, and the vast amount of fictional technical detail he invents sounds so scientifically plausible that it is easy to excuse a few otherwise amusing anachronisms, such as Kelvin's need to consult logarithmic tables while performing calculations on the space station's \\"giant computer,\\" which apparently is not big enough to be able to calculate logarithms itself.  Regardless of these trivialities, \\"Solaris\\" is an incredible, suspenseful journey that captured my imagination and held my attention to the last page.    <br />	2005-07-23

Hardy is his usual unforgiving self in this grim, discomforting tale of educational goals thwarted, marital bliss destroyed, childhood innocence corrupted, and spiritual redemption viciously mocked.  Those who might suspect that this is a recent example of the current cultural debasement of family values would be amazed to know that this novel was written not in 1995 but in 1895.  Upon its publication, Hardy was criticized for his pessimism when all he was did was herald the arrival of the pessimistic twentieth century. <br /> <br />\\"Jude the Obscure\\" is not an indictment of education, marriage, family, or religion, but rather Hardy's bitter commentary on how society misuses these institutions to defend its shaky beliefs and practices.  Jude Fawley, the title character and society's puppet, is a young man trying in vain to transcend his environment.  A stonemason by trade, he dauntlessly studies Latin and Greek with the rigorous mind of a classical scholar in preparation for entering the ivy-covered Gothic halls of Christminster, a college town supposed to evoke Oxford.  Two things stand in his way: He is too poor to afford the tuition, and he marries an ignorant farm girl named Arabella who discourages his academic aspirations.  <br /> <br />Separated from Arabella but still legally married, Jude begins a relationship with his pretty cousin, Sue Bridehead, after he moves to Christminster to be nearer his goal, supporting himself with various stonemasonry jobs.  Sue marries Jude's former teacher, Richard Phillotson, many years her senior, also rejected by Christminster and now a local schoolmaster.  When Phillotson realizes that Sue's heart belongs to Jude, he sorrowfully but graciously cuts her loose, whereupon she goes to live with her lover.  The irony that Hardy emphasizes is that the two couples in the novel who were never meant to be--Jude and Arabella, and Phillotson and Sue--were the ones who married, while Jude and Sue, the only mutually happy couple, are unmarriageable to each other.  <br /> <br />Sue is the most interesting, and arguably the most tragic, figure in the novel.  At first  she appears to be a devout Christian, working in a shop that makes religious ornamentation; but she soon reveals herself to be as cynical as Jude is earnest, acknowledging that she and Jude are descendants of a fractured family for whom marriage seems not to be intended.  However, towards the end of the novel her character is transformed by a misfortune so violent and sickening that it has the power to convince her that she is being punished for her sinful ways.  A pious person would be probably cheered by choosing conventional morality after such an incident, but Sue, fearful of the wrath of a divine force she can't know or control, is only made more miserable by feeling pressured to accept the undesirable situation of living with her lawful husband.    <br /> <br />\\"Jude the Obscure,\\" even more so than Hardy's other famous novels, is swamped in loneliness, frustration, disillusion, anger, and hopelessness, all delivered by the relentless fist of fate, and it is exhausting to imagine the emotional abysses he would have had to plumb had he decided against all critical opposition to continue this avenue of his career.  Hardy, like Jude an autodidact but unlike Jude a professional success nonetheless, is plaintive about a social system that prevents talented people of poverty from realizing their potential while requiring them to live holy lives.  His response was to write a book that would shock the public, not to shame them, but into seeing what he saw.   <br /> <br />	2005-07-19
US	49396726	R31KE1LTV9S96Q	0316926078	769825173	Decline and Fall	Books	5	37	38	N	N	School ties	Evelyn Waugh's first novel \\"Decline and Fall\\" pops like a cork from a bottle of champagne.  While many authors take years and volumes to find just the right tone, the 25-year-old Waugh, who had just published a biography of Dante Rossetti, seems to have had his literary concept perfectly in mind from the start and hit the ground running with this raucously funny yet astonishingly mature debut.   <br /> <br />The hero (although Waugh would disagree with the term) is Paul Pennyfeather, a divinity student at Scone College, Oxford, who as the book begins is expelled for \\"indecent behavior\\" of which he is actually innocent, and is promptly disowned by his guardian over the shame educed by this incident.  Now, in need of money, he searches for a job, and the only one he can get is a teaching position at a small boys' school located in a Welsh castle called Llanabba. <br /> <br />Llanabba, while not quite rivaling Dotheboys Hall of \\"Nicholas Nickleby,\\" is a woefully undignified educational facility, an institution of incompetence.  The headmaster is a crafty curmudgeon named Dr. Fagan, the butler Philbrick is a criminal who prospers by constantly falsifying his identity, and the boys are an undisciplined and ungifted lot.  The other instructors seem to have been deposited there for having failed elsewhere: Mr. Prendergast, a clergyman who has left the Church because of \\"Doubts,\\" and Captain Grimes, a maimed ex-soldier (\\"Think I lost it in the war,\\" he tells Pennyfeather about his missing leg) who is continually \\"in the soup\\" but always manages to extricate himself.  <br /> <br />Romance, or rather that badinage between the sexes that passes for romance in Waugh's world, turns out to be Pennyfeather's bane, initiating his misadventures in the second half of the novel.  His engagement to marry the voluptuous Mrs. Beste-Chetwynde, the widowed mother of one of the Llanabba boys, is interrupted by his incarceration for unwittingly assisting her business of procuring prostitutes, one of whom is Grimes's wife; in prison he unsurprisingly encounters some old friends who can help him break free, and by the author's grace everything comes full circle in the end. <br /> <br />One of Waugh's many strengths is his ability to create a multitude of humorous characters out of completely original cloth.  There is a family whose names are inspired by geometry: a Llanabba boy named Tangent and his mother, the globular Lady Circumference, whose boorish manners belie her title.  The indirect cause of Pennyfeather's predicament, and his eventual savior, is the young dandy Sir Alistair Trumpington, who makes a major appearance in Waugh's later novel \\"Put Out More Flags.\\"  And the brainiest character in the novel is Otto Silenus, a young German architect with a philosophical outlook and a radical style who is hired by Mrs. Beste-Chetwynde to renovate her celebrated country house called King's Thursday.  <br /> <br />Silenus's concluding metaphor about life--a spinning wheel on which some people are meant to be riders and the rest spectators--is not as silly as it sounds; it seems as if Waugh's authorial impulse is to exhibit the contrast between the two types of people and observe the comical results when the boundary is crossed.   <br /> <br />	2005-07-09
US	49396726	R9V7TJXMUH40E	0140432620	374464565	Daisy Miller (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	5	7	N	N	James's garden of earthly delights	I persist with Henry James, trying to build up an appreciation for this literary master whose style does not exactly roll out the red carpet for his readers.  His early novella \\"Daisy Miller,\\" however, shows that a kinder, gentler James prevailed before the tyrant of verbosity took over.  For those who have not yet experienced James's writing, as a start I recommend \\"Daisy Miller\\" for its relative simplicity of plot and prose, as opposed to his monstrously difficult later novels like \\"The Golden Bowl.\\"  <br /> <br />The story is told from the vantage of the frostily-named Frederick Winterbourne, a wealthy and not quite young American man who has lived in Europe for most of his life.  He is vacationing in Vevey, Switzerland, visiting his witch of an aunt, Mrs. Costello, when he meets the stunningly pretty Annie \\"Daisy\\" Miller, her vapid mother, and her bratty little brother Randolph.  The Millers are nouveau riche; Daisy's father, the absent Mr. Miller, is an industrialist in Schenectady, New York, and his family lack sophistication in their speech and manners.  Mrs. Costello snobbishly identifies them immediately as \\"very common...the sort of Americans that one does one's duty by not accepting.\\" <br /> <br />Winterbourne travels to Rome to visit his friend Mrs. Walker; the Millers also have come to Rome.  Mrs. Walker reveals to Winterbourne that Daisy, whom she has gotten to know, is a slut who cavorts indiscriminately with all kinds of men including a suave but rakish Italian named Giovanelli, and advises him to forget about her.  But Daisy is a supreme charmer--it's impossible not to fall in love with her--and Winterbourne likes her despite her frivolousness and silliness.  Unfortunately, she considers the sensible Winterbourne too \\"stiff\\" to value his opinions about her behavior, and Giovanelli is so desperate to be with her that he is all too willing to take advantage of her ignorance of European customs, an indifference on her part that leads to her ultimate tragedy.    <br /> <br />What might have motivated James to write this seemingly simple, even slight, story?  He seems to see the rules of society as a game to be played by many different types of personalities, and he enjoys characters, particularly women, who clash with convention, even though what was scandalous in his time raises nary an eyebrow today.  In \\"Daisy Miller\\" we have an American girl who is too immature to understand or care about the proprieties of high society, a girl who probably in James's opinion would have been better served staying poor and working in a laundry back home in Schenectady than acting like a princess in foreign lands.  <br />	2005-07-06

Fugui, a living embodiment of a fall from grace, was the son of a wealthy landowner, but he was idle and prodigal in his youth and gambled away his family's fortune to a man named Long Er.  Forced to hand over his large ancestral house to Long Er and move into a small tenant hut, Fugui learned what it means to have to work the land for a living to support himself, his wife Jiazhen, his daughter Fengxia, who through a malady becomes deaf and mute, and his son Youqing.   <br /> <br />While running to town one day to get a doctor for his sickly mother, Fugui is accosted by soldiers and is forcefully conscripted into the Nationalist Army, with whom he serves two years until they are defeated by the Liberation Army (i.e., the Communists).  He is allowed to return home to his family, with whom he has been unable to communicate all this time, only to find that the Communists are changing the old way of life.  His farming village is turned into a commune in which the residents are supervised by a \\"team leader,\\" receive compensation by earning \\"work points,\\" and must surrender the bulk of their personal property to a central command while Red Guards come to paint Maoist slogans on the walls.   <br /> <br />Initially the new system seems beneficial, as plenty of food is provided to the community; but conditions worsen when the party officials fail to deliver enough grain to grow crops, putting the villagers at risk of starvation and disease.  We see that, although Fugui was lazy and wasteful in his youth, the novel turns out not to be an object lesson about the dangers of laziness or wastefulness, because Yu Hua makes it clear that even if Fugui had remained wealthy, the Communists would have seized all his property anyway--by twisted luck, it is not Fugui but his rapacious successor Long Er who is executed for being a landowner.     <br /> <br />Fugui's mother's platitude that \\"as long as you are happy, being poor is nothing to be ashamed of,\\" is an uncanny echo of the Greek philosopher Epicurus's notion that a cheerful poverty is an honorable existence.  But poverty is rarely cheerful, and Fugui has scant reason to be happy.  His misfortunes continue to pile up as though with a vengeance, just one thing after another, until every addition to his little family is taken away from him through the cruelest channels.  Occasionally there is a reprieve; for instance, Fengxia, whose handicap makes her an undesirable candidate for a wife, eventually does find a man, with a strange deformity of his own, willing to marry her.   <br /> <br />In one respect, this is a terribly depressing novel, infused with a pessimism about life with which Theodore Dreiser would have sympathized; on the other hand, Fugui's will to live, despite soul-crushing tragedies few of us could bear, is a triumph of the spirit.  But Fugui is not a spiritual person, nor does he evidently observe any religion.  He is just thankful, to whom we and he do not know, for his \\"ordinary life,\\" a quality of life that allowed him to live long enough through the calamities and political upheavals to experience the love of his family.  \\"This is my fate,\\" this wizened man, who has suffered more than Job, concludes fatalistically.   <br /> <br />	2005-06-29

His five short novels, collected in this New Directions Paperback edition, are utterly unclassifiable; no genre suggests itself when they are being read.  His prose, as fastidiously styled as a coiffured poodle, as twee as an afternoon tea, is bewilderingly florid even beyond the standards of his contemporaries.  With the descriptive proclivities of an interior decorator, he paints with all the colors on the palette; an orchid is not just an orchid but a \\"rose-lipped\\" orchid with a \\"lilac beard.\\"  England had not seen lyrical flamboyance like this since Oscar Wilde a quarter century before, and would not see it again until the ascendance of Freddie Mercury a half century later.   <br /> <br />But Firbank's writing is not just fancy window dressing.  His stories may look like fairy tales because of the whimsical characters and settings, but his narrative technique fractures the linearity of the plots by focusing on external details.  In \\"The Flower Beneath the Foot,\\" for example, the subject of the conversation in the first few pages is not immediately apparent, but disclosure gradually occurs over the course of the following chapters: His Weariness the Prince Yousef's mother, the Queen of some mythical Arabesque realm called the Land of Dates, disapproves of her son's desire to marry the humble convent-dwelling Mademoiselle de Nazianzi instead of Princess Elsie of England.  Not until the final paragraph does Firbank dispel the story's genteel facade to reveal a passionately beating, and broken, heart.  <br /> <br />Firbank's characters are garish works of art, most of them either impossibly frivolous nobles of theatrically exaggerated primness or paupers with pride and dignity.  As in \\"The Flower Beneath the Foot,\\" a common theme is star-crossed love, a romance between two people of different social stations.  This love can be interracial, as it is in \\"Valmouth,\\" a British colony with a climate so salubrious that the inhabitants live well over a hundred years, as well as in another novel with an evidently Caribbean setting and a controversial title which I refrain from typing so as not to have to wrestle with the Amazon censorship filter.  Infatuation can also be grotesque, as it is in \\"The Artificial Princess,\\" whose heroine, reluctantly betrothed to a foreign Crown Prince, unwittingly encounters the Devil on the night of her debut.   <br /> <br />Firbank, one of the first of many English Catholic writers to emerge in the twentieth century, is comfortable setting one of his novels in Spain.  \\"Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli\\" is self-explanatory, as the good cardinal, who allows aristocratic dogs to be baptized as a favor to wealthy patrons and disguises himself in the street as laity of either gender, risks being defrocked by the Roman church for his perceived sacrileges.   <br /> <br />This is humor, but of a less obvious sort; unlike P.G. Wodehouse, who made a handsome living with his comical portraits of the upper class, Firbank doesn't target a specific group of people or stratum of society, nor does he seem interested in such petty substantiality.  His fiction, insulated in a world unscarred by war and populated by dainty animated dolls, is an idyllic extension of reality, somehow a reminder of the limitless expanse of literature where formulas lose their validity and time stands still.  Toss aside all your preconceptions, because these novellas will surprise you.     <br />	2005-06-27
US	49396726	R18MWVTDLB4U4E	006093140X	285203459	The Golden Notebook: Perennial Classics edition	Books	3	137	154	N	N	An interesting mess of a novel	Intellectual energy is always a healthy attribute for a writer of fiction.  Doris Lessing, an incredibly prolific author who has covered many different genres, has plenty; but her early novel \\"The Golden Notebook\\" too often sacrifices coherence and focus for ineffective artistic experimentation.  That it doesn't have much of a plot is not a deficiency, because many great modern novels have discarded the notion of a necessity for a conventional plot; rather, its narrative power is diminished by Lessing's apparent indecisiveness about the kind of tale she wishes to tell.  In one section she writes synopses of about two dozen short stories in quick succession, and we have to wonder why we're looking at blueprints instead of the finished product.  <br />  <br />Summarily, \\"The Golden Notebook\\" is a work of fiction about the erratic process of writing fiction, and it problematically attempts to intertwine several novels into one.  The main story is that of Lessing's alter ego Anna Wulf, who compiles her memoirs, blending the real with the fictional, into four color-coded notebooks of which the contents are revealed in an alternating fashion.  Anna, a rising literary star who has published an acclaimed novel called \\"Frontiers of War\\" based loosely on her experiences and her circle of friends in Rhodesia where she lived during World War II, now resides in England with her young daughter Janet, drawing income from gradually dwindling royalties while being courted by philistine film producers who propose to adapt and warp her novel for the screen. <br /> <br />Love and sexuality play major roles throughout the multiple narratives, but \\"The Golden Notebook\\" is neither sentimental enough to be a romantic novel nor cynical enough to be a satire.  Anna's relationships with a string of men, from her ex-husband Max, a German refugee whom she met in Africa, to an aimless American expatriate named Saul, are the basis of her fictional life; she has created an alter ego of her own named Ella, a struggling novelist who has numerous affairs almost exclusively with married men, to be used possibly as the heroine of a new novel.  She can be maternal as well, not just to her daughter but also to her older friend Molly's son Tommy, a restless and discontented youth who is forced to endure the physical aftermath of a botched suicide attempt. <br /> <br />A central feature of \\"The Golden Notebook\\" is the changing course of Anna's political outlook which begins in Rhodesia.  Her abhorrence of the \\"color bar\\"--the racist policies of white European colonists towards blacks--in southern Africa and her observations of the poverty of the workers steered her towards Communism.  As it turns out, the British Communists with whom she associates are a muddled and disorganized group, inveterate liars and prevaricators with utopian delusions; but Anna's eventual decision to leave them arises more from her disenchantment with their attitude that art should be used only for political purposes and not to express personal ideas or emotions.  This is anathema to a creative writer such as Anna, as it should be; \\"The Golden Notebook\\" is Lessing's defiant response to that dictum.  <br /> <br />Were I to describe \\"The Golden Notebook\\" accurately as remarkably original, uniquely structured, overflowing with a multitude of literary thoughts, and driven by fascinating impulses, you might think it a book worth reading; but in fact I hesitate to recommend it to anybody but an avowed Lessing fan.  When Saul asks Anna why she keeps four separate notebooks, she answers that \\"...it's been necessary to split [her]self up,\\" and therein lies the trouble--the reader is made to suffer for Anna's narrative schizophrenia.  I am unsure whether \\"The Golden Notebook,\\" so energetic but so disjointed, is too much or not enough of whatever it is that it wants to be, but it is definitely not the correct amount.   <br /> <br />	2005-06-23

Thumbing through the pages invokes that particular aura of an ancient struggle against evil in a world of horrible monsters, brave warriors, clashing swords and spraying gore, shape-shifting wizards, fair ladies, and towering castles overlooking dreary fantasy landscapes.  However, there must be more to it than just eye candy for Edmund Spenser to have been worthy of burial in Westminster Abbey; \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" like Virgil's Aeneid before it or Wagner's Ring cycle after, is a nationalistic and moralistic doctrine layered with religious and historical allusions that transcend its veneer of fabulous imagery. <br /> <br />As explained in a letter to his peer Sir Walter Raleigh, Spenser's plan was to write twelve \\"books,\\" each containing twelve cantos and portraying a virtue from Aristotle's Ethics in the guise of a knight on a quest, the totality intended as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth, who in the epic is implied to be the Faerie Queene.  Only six of the twelve books were completed: holiness, temperance, chastity, friendship, justice, and courtesy.  The actions of the knights in their respective books are supposed to exemplify the specified virtues as proper behavior in the service of the Queene; conversely, vices such as envy, lust, and furor are represented as obstructors or monsters to be defeated by the knights.  Stripped of its considerably gaudy window dressing, \\"The Faerie Queene\\" is a simple series of object lessons.     <br /> <br />The content is a strange, but not totally incongruous, amalgamation of legends from Greek and Egyptian mythology, the Crusades, Arthurian lore, Italian Renaissance poetry, and Spenser's own invention.  As though they had emerged from a set of medieval \\"narrative\\" tapestries, thestories are dazzlingly intricate in plot and detail: The hero of the first book, the \\"Redcrosse Knight,\\" must rescue the parents of the princess Una (the Protestant Church) from a dragon (the Roman Catholic Church), aided by Arthur, here but a prince.  The third book begins the story of Britomart, a lady who disguises herself as a knight in order to find Artegall, the knight of Justice in the fifth book, with whom she is enamored when she sees his image in a magic mirror.  There are some interesting cross-references, such as the tale of King Lear and his three daughters mentioned in a history of England in the second book. <br /> <br />Although English spelling was not conventionalized until dictionaries began to be compiled two centuries later, the poem's peculiar appearance is not representative of the typical writing of the late sixteenth century.  The language, archaic even for Spenser's time, is designed to emulate Chaucer, then the standard English poet, in an attempt to conjure a medieval mood, a romanticized past.  The misspellings are even intentionally inconsistent; for instance, \\"giant\\" is variably spelled Gyant or Geant or Gyaunt but never Giant.  The idea, I think, is to signal to the reader that the poem should evoke the days when poems were more often spoken aloud than read, so what the words sound like is more important than what they look like; another clue to this is that Spenser is actually quite meticulous about the words he chooses to misspell.   <br /> <br />Glorification of a national heritage is a tall order, so who can blame the poet for his excesses?  \\"The Faerie Queene,\\" a project distinguished by its sheer ambitiousness, is an intense reading experience that overwhelms its own flaws and difficulties.    <br /> <br />	2005-06-13
US	49396726	R3PFIQSP6E4NMX	0811200701	809318885	The Berlin Stories: The Last of Mr. Norris and  Goodbye to Berlin (New Directions Books)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Marvelous but doomed urban microcosm	In the early 1930s the British writer Christopher Isherwood lived in Berlin working as a tutor teaching English to Germans.  Through fictionalizations, he later documented his experiences in \\"The Berlin Stories,\\" a book that actually consists of two novellas originally published separately, in 1935 and 1939 respectively.  Together they cover the tumultuous political and social spectra that constituted the city--possibly the most culturally and technologically advanced in Europe at the time--and which simultaneously tore it apart while human monsters were preparing to bring the world to war.  <br /> <br />Berlin has been suffering from a dire economy since the first World War, and extreme conditions--high inflation and high unemployment--lead to extreme solutions; Communists and the newly risen Nazis are becoming visible and powerful (but mutually opposing) political entities.  To this end, the first novella, called \\"The Last of Mr. Norris,\\" builds itself from a simple meeting between two characters into a literate tale of espionage.  Isherwood's narrator, William Bradshaw, meets another Englishman named Arthur Norris on a train en route to Berlin, where Norris claims to operate an import-export business, and soon becomes his friend.  Evasive and habitually nervous, Norris is a subtly ridiculous figure with an unconvincing wig, a domination fetish, a duplicitous secretary named Schmidt, and a companion named von Pregnitz, a wealthy baron.    <br /> <br />The plot proceeds linearly but tensely, as Bradshaw accompanies Norris one day to a meeting of a group of Communists to whom Norris gives a speech about the combined threat of British imperialism and capitalist exploitation.  His machinations are more complicated than this display of apparent hypocrisy might reveal, however.  The important thing to know about Norris is that he is the most pathetic of opportunists; he has no devotions, no commitments, no beliefs, and no desires but to make enough money to live comfortably if not richly.  He has created his own hell, and somehow Schmidt will always be there as his punisher, the devil on his back.   <br /> <br />In \\"Goodbye to Berlin,\\" the second novella, Isherwood casts himself into the role of narrator in a more personal and realistic series of sketches based on people he had met while living in the city.  He introduces us to the unforgettable femme fatale Sally Bowles, a  promiscuous English girl who sings in cabarets and plans to become an actress by any means necessary; Otto Nowak, a likeable teenager from a working-class neighborhood, the kind of place where the kids, unlikely to find gainful employment in this economy, could easily be lured to join the Nazis; and the Landauers, Jewish owners of a large department store, who stand as a reminder of the imminence of the Nazi destruction of German Jewry, of a people whose prosperity is coming to a violent end.   <br /> <br />These are not sad stories, but they convey the transience of friendship and the hardships of life in a city confronting an uncertain future.  As I read, I observed that Isherwood portrays almost everybody as younger than he or she appears, indicating that Berlin at this time is a city in which people grow up, and grow old, quickly.  As if to allay this unnatural aging, the dialogue is exceptionally lively and witty; Isherwood's characters are involved in what he at one point astutely calls \\"verbal card-playing.\\"  As they talk, we can clearly sense their dreams and fears, and we find ourselves concerned about where the forces of history will take them, or leave them.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-06
US	49396726	RV9D4RWHAQSPT	0671646575	772203017	Heat and Dust	Books	4	36	36	N	N	Straddling 1947	The British experience in India is a subject that has been given thorough literary treatment during the past century, and most of these books have tried to highlight some aspect of the cultural contrast between east and west.  E.M. Forster's \\"A Passage to India\\" is perhaps the most comprehensive of these, but Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's \\"Heat and Dust\\" makes an admirable effort to contribute to the Forsterian legacy by updating the milieu to a post-independence setting while keeping one foot firmly in the past. <br /> <br />The novel concerns a young English woman, the narrator, who arrives in Bombay intending to make it her home for a while and to reconstruct the story of the doomed marriage of her grandfather, a law officer named Douglas Rivers, and his first wife, Olivia, from a collection of intriguing letters that Olivia had written to her sister Marcia.  From the beginning Jhabvala splits the novel into two parallel narratives, alternating between the Riverses in 1923 and the narrator in India fifty years later, who presents her adventures, thoughts, and reflections in the form of a journal.       <br /> <br />Olivia Rivers is a bored housewife who has little to do besides playing the piano and chatting with the other British officers' wives until she becomes enamored with the charming Indian prince, called the Nawab, who governs the district Douglas serves.  A living emblem of amoral corruption and aristocratic gluttony, the Nawab dwells in an ancestral palace that arrogantly overlooks the wretched slums of the neighboring town and supports an entourage of servants and sycophantic companions including an effeminate Englishman named Harry.  Jhabvala employs these elements to shape a dramatic arc that leads from extramarital attraction to adultery and finally to Olivia's disgrace following an ugly scandal for which she could never be forgiven back in England. <br />  <br />The narrator's analogous existence within the pages gives the novel an even broader context; she too falls in love with an Indian man, although a much humbler one, a meek clerk named Inder Lal.  She also observes that India is a magnet for Europeans in search of a certain spirituality that they have failed to find in Western religions; in particular she meets a young Englishman who has become a Hindu ascetic, calling himself Chid, but who cannot handle the hardships of a land of such disease and poverty.  The novel's title refers to the general climate of the region of which the narrator writes, a scorching exacerbation of the hopeless squalor in which the vast majority of the population lives. <br /> <br />I am aware that Jhabvala has written screenplays based on classic novels, including Forster's, for the Merchant-Ivory film team, and I confess that I somewhat expected \\"Heat and Dust\\" to be a pastiche of Forster, but I was pleased to find that Jhabvala, although like Forster a lucid and elegant prose stylist, has a distinctive literary voice, specifically in her shrewd eye for the particularities of Indian culture.  From the suttee stones, morbid monuments to Hindu widows who have immolated themselves in their husbands' funeral pyres, to the British cemeteries memorializing the soldiers fallen in the 1857 mutinies, \\"Heat and Dust\\" is a valuable tour through 1920s and 1970s India.   <br />	2005-05-30

Halicarnassian-Greek writer Herodotus is that it is a chronicle of the Persian campaign to conquer the known world and of their subsequent defeat by the underdog Greeks.  But there is surprisingly much more to it to satisfy a general readership.  It is not just a military history but a social and natural history as well, a virtual museum of all facets of life and death in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern lands of the time, including observations on geography and zoology and even dipping into the most bizarre of folklore.  Herodotus's reputation as the \\"first\\" historian is endlessly debatable, but his authority is undeniable; it's easy to see the influence his engaging style had on later historical writers from Livy to Robert Graves.  More of a bard than a lecturer, he writes to entertain as well as to inform. <br /> <br />It is interesting to see on the maps that the Persian empire once covered much of the same territory as that which Alexander the Great was to take for himself a century after Herodotus's death.  The Persians were highly skilled, intelligent, and bellicose, and their drive to dominate the lands around them was the work of a line of kings--Cyrus, Cambyses, Darius, and finally Xerxes--who were variably powermad, insane, bloodthirsty, and not less cruel to their own citizens than to their enemies.  They invaded both east (what is now India) and west, conquering all of Asia Minor and forging down into Egypt and Libya; but their limited strength could overcome the resistance of neither the Scythians, who lived in the country that is now Ukraine, nor the Greeks of the lower peninsula, who represented a loose alliance of scattered city-states, Athens and Sparta the most prominent.   <br /> <br />Herodotus was a traveler and claims to have seen most of the places he describes, so the histories serve also as a journal detailing the customs of foreign cultures.  His account of the fabulous city of Babylon, fortified by fantastically thick walls and bronze gates and housing a curious labyrinth, is amazing but tantalizingly brief.  (That he does not mention the famous Hanging Gardens leads some modern scholars to suspect they actually might have been located elsewhere in Assyria.)  Of Egypt he discusses the mummification process, the method of building the pyramids, the mystery of the source of the Nile.  His essays on animals are quite intriguing; for example, we learn that the Nile crocodile's favorite bird is the sandpiper because it cleans the river leeches out of the reptile's gaping mouth.  Some of his animals, though, such as the giant ants of central Asia and the tiny winged snakes that guard the frankincense bushes of Arabia, are difficult to regard as anything but ludicrous.   <br /> <br />Chronological order is not sacred to Herodotus; he is a desultory and digressive writer who jumps back and forth between various subjects and times as he sees fit.  It should be noted that what he is presenting as history are perceptions rather than verifiable facts; he is only recording things that he has seen and that other people have told him, although at times he tosses in a personal opinion or doubt as to whether something truly happened as opposed to hearsay.  This does not really matter if the histories are read as literature (as I have read them), because the total effect is that of a great story with almost the sweep of a Homeric epic, perhaps without the poetical flourishes.  Two world powers locked in a death struggle--history certainly does repeat itself.     <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-29

It is about the events leading up to a wedding, and of course there is plenty of talk about dresses and cooking and dancing, but Welty, almost like Virginia Woolf's American counterpart, suffuses the atmosphere with mysterious psychological undercurrents and the foreboding aura of secrecy.  We get the sense that there is more to these people's personalities than the text can convey, and we read on patiently and attentively, hoping to unravel the complexities.    <br /> <br />The setting is the area of central Mississippi through which the Yazoo River flows, not far from Faulkner country geographically or literarily; much of the land in this particular locality is owned by a family named the Fairchilds, the dynastic centerpiece of the story.  The prevalent symbol in the novel is a train called the Yellow Dog, the principal means of mass transportation that connects this part of Mississippi to the rest of the state.  This is the train that brings nine-year-old Laura McRaven from Jackson to visit the Fairchilds, her cousins, on their plantation, where Dabney (that's a girl) Fairchild is engaged to be married within the week to a man twice her age named Troy Flavin.   <br /> <br />It is also the train that, not long before the novel begins, nearly ran over Laura's uncle George as he tried to rescue his addled niece Maureen who had caught her foot in a trestle.  George's wife Robbie had witnessed this near-accident and now is using it as an excuse to leave him--how could he be so selfish as to risk his life and widow her?  Although this does not speak well of Robbie's character, the source of her discontent is really alienation.  She knows that she is beneath George's station, and every instance in which he bonds with another Fairchild only affirms that the Fairchild mystique is a closed circle, impenetrable to her. <br /> <br />For a novel concerned about a wedding in the immediate present, it is deeply immersed in its characters' pasts.  Laura is an only child whose mother has recently passed away, so this large house where she is surrounded by myriad cousins, aunts, and uncles, like legendary creatures whose fantastic world she has suddenly entered, is an awesome environment with a rich and intricate history.  The Fairchilds are such a regional monument that the entire town cemetery is practically their very own mausoleum; Dr. Murdoch, the insensitive local physician, picks out future burial plots for Fairchilds as though he were deciding where to plant flowers in a garden.   <br /> <br />One interesting characteristic of \\"Delta Wedding\\" is that, true to impressionistic storytelling, there is no traditional protagonist that I could identify.  Laura receives much of the focus, but this is not really her story, nor is it narrated in her voice.  Dabney is too shallow and spoiled to be a heroine; her older sister Shelley, a smarter and more serious girl, is not interested in being a heroine, and good for her.  \\"Delta Wedding\\" does well without a hero because it is realistic fiction at its most crystalline; a sincere, authentic depiction of life in the rural deep South of the 1920s which shows a part of the country modernizing to the twentieth century even while clinging to the shadows of the past. <br />	2005-05-14
US	49396726	R1YXBCRVK1BOOQ	0812036042	771134625	Twelfth Night or What You Will	Books	5	1	2	N	N	The thrust of greatness	\\"Twelfth Night\\" is built upon the reliable comedic premise of mistaken identity.  We begin with a shipwreck and a twin brother and sister, Sebastian and Viola, each of whom believes that the other has died at sea.  Viola disguises herself as a boy and, assuming the name of Cesario, gets a job as a page for Orsino, the duke of Illyria, with whom she is in love.  Orsino, however, is in love with a lofty young countess named Olivia, who has no interest in him and furthermore is mourning her own brother's recent death.  Orsino dispatches Cesario/Viola to relay his amorous entreaties to Olivia, hoping that Cesario's youth may make him a more appealing messenger and soften her heart; but, wouldn't you know, Olivia becomes attracted to Cesario instead.   <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Olivia's uncle, Sir Toby Belch, a knavish and idle aristocrat, is distressed by his niece's apparent desire to remain unmarried and tries to prepare his protege, the dimwitted but affable Sir Andrew Aguecheek, as a suitor.  As part of a secondary plot, Sir Toby and Sir Andrew cooperate with Olivia's maid, Maria, to play a practical joke on Olivia's steward Malvolio, a humorless stuffed shirt whose conceit has finally piqued them all, by forging a letter that leads him to believe that his beautiful employer is in love with him.  The ruse pays off, and Malvolio is imprisoned for madness after satisfactorily making a spectacle of himself in front of Olivia.  Rounding out this retinue of clowns is Olivia's jester, named Feste, who, like King Lear's fool, seems to know more about the people around him than they know about themselves. <br /> <br />\\"Twelfth Night\\" is not just a comedy but, as the title indicates, a festive play in which songs and holiday spirit figure into the mood, providing a relaxed and joyous atmosphere in which the audience may feel privy to an elaborate jest.  Certainly the plot is predictable, but its predictability is part of what makes it truly funny.  We all (Shakespeare not theleast of us) know how absurd it is that Viola disguised as a boy would look and sound so exactly like her twin brother as to make the two indistinguishable to the other characters in the play, but this is the indispensible device that holds the comedy together.  Pretending to be someone or something you are not is the essence of the act, the idea encapsulated in \\"Twelfth Night\\" and expressed by Feste's sarcastic riposte to Sebastian, \\"Nothing that is so, is so.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-11

A notorious anecdote about \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" relates that Abraham Lincoln, upon greeting Harriet Beecher Stowe at a White House reception, jokingly referred to her as the lady who wrote the book that started the Civil War.  Sardonic as it is, the implication does some basis; appearing in 1852, eleven years before the Emancipation Proclamation, this novel forcefully decrying the institution of slavery and helping to stir the nation towards abolition was probably the most incendiary of the century.  That it is often crude and quaintly primitive compared to contemporaneous works by Hawthorne and Melville only seems to increase the sense of its mission, oddly enough.   <br /> <br />Simply put, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" dramatizes the conditions of American slavery.  Stowe bases her characters and their stories on actual accounts of which she had known or heard, but more notably her imagination is fostered by an ethical conscience whose predominant source is the Bible.  (It is not surprising to learn that she came from a family of preachers; there are passages in this novel that read like \\"The Pilgrim's Progress.\\")  She tries awkwardly to maintain a balance in the novel between high melodrama, low comedy, tales of adventure and suspense, and noble but obtrusive exhortations about the inhumanity and unchristianity of slavery.      <br /> <br />The hero is \\"Uncle\\" Tom, a religious patriarch and evangelist among everyone he meets, who is separated from his family and is sold from owner to owner--the kind but dissolute Augustine St. Clare, and the nasty and cruel Simon Legree--in an odyssey that parallels the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt, a sort of journey to redemption.  In addition to Tom's travails, the novel tells the story of a married couple of fugitive slaves named George and Eliza who have escaped from their respective owners to save their baby son from being sold to a trader and to flee to freedom in Canada, aided by Quakers and other sympathetic northerners.<br /> <br />In his introduction to the Bantam Classics edition, the critic Alfred Kazin defends \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" with hand placed firmly on hilt, equating its artistry to its honorable abolitionist sentiments and its historical importance.  I respectfully differ with Kazin in this case.  I don't consider moral outrage to be solid ground on which to build a work of fiction.  Dickens does it best, though that is the least of what makes him a great writer.  Stowe, whose overbearing piety outshines her attention to language and narration, is not so skillful.   <br /> <br />Stylistically, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" is uncannily similar to Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" (1906), a book written for a very different reason but with the same magnitude of passionate indignation--both are novels of sloppily overwrought prose intertwining drab narratives of two-dimensional characters and heavy-handed pathos with finger-wagging social commentary.  The atrocity of slavery and the problem of unnecessarily unhealthy, dangerous working conditions are too serious to be represented by shabby fictionalizations.  Should Stowe and Sinclair be regarded as bad novelists or competent pamphleteers?  If the latter, then those who somehow are not already convinced that slavery is blatantly evil should by all means read \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\"  <br /> <br />	2005-05-06

A Hollywood screenwriter who migrated from studio to studio in search of sustenance, West was a humorist with a warped conscience, a young man who had fraudulently gained admission to Brown University and probably belonged there anyway, an intellectual misfit trying to make a living and a name for himself in a glitzy industry.  Like Kafka with a comic-strip aesthetic, West saw the world and the people around him as the tortured products of an insane creator, cartoons to be stretched, punched, and mutilated. <br /> <br />\\"Few things are sadder than the truly monstrous,\\" West observes in \\"The Day of the Locust,\\" the last of his novels, which made an indelible impression upon me when I first read it a few years ago.  Ironically, sadness is definitely not the note he strikes in his portrayal of a congregation of hilarious cretins who populate the fringes of 1930s Hollywood; it is a very brash and \\"loud\\" novel, but incredibly it is more refined and less outrageous than its three predecessors.  The surrealistic narrative of \\"The Dream Life of Balso Snell,\\" by contrast, is not to be read with a queasy stomach.  The unassuming Mr. Snell happens upon a giant wooden horse--apparently the same the ancient Greeks used to infiltrate Troy--and, entering through the posterior, finds the intestines inhabited by unhinged writers in search of an audience.    <br /> <br />In \\"Miss Lonelyhearts,\\" the title character (who is a man) is an advice columnist for a newspaper, unable to muster anything better than empty platitudes in response to tearful letters from barely literate and improbably pathetic losers who are mostly beyond help.  He is not, however, doing this just as a hoax; he approaches his role soberly because the trust his correspondents place in him forces him to \\"examine the values by which he lives.\\"If \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\" seems farcical, consider how accurately it prophesies the Jerry Springer era of televised dirty laundry and voluntary public embarrassment. <br /> <br />\\"A Cool Million\\" is a relentlessly cruel Horatio Alger parody that follows the misadventures of Lemuel Pitkin, a Vermont boy who goes to New York to try to make a fortune in order to save his mother's house from foreclosure but is foiled continually as he encounters an endless procession of human sleaze: corrupt businessmen, brutish cops, brothel operators and their clientele, rapists, thieves, and con men.  (The screen story West wrote for \\"A Cool Million\\"--a project never filmed--is understandably so much cleaner and more optimistic that it hardly resembles the original novel.) <br /> <br />The four novels combined constitute only half of the Library of America volume, the rest of which includes miscellaneous fragments, plays, and letters.  Among the detritus are the unsuccessful play \\"Good Hunting,\\" a relatively conventional satire of war and war correspondence, an unfilmed screenplay based on Francis Iles's novel \\"Before the Fact\\" (a different screenplay by another author was used by the studio instead, and was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock as \\"Suspicion\\"), and a college essay praising Euripides to the stars.  This juxtaposition effectively illuminates the two dichotomous worlds of West--the true artist and the commercial hack, the grotesque emerging from the mundane.   <br />	2005-04-29
US	49396726	R3N243BK3FSVFT	0553213938	903070373	The Custom of the Country (Bantam Classics)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	The view from the top	Undine Spragg, the highest-maintenance of Edith Wharton's heroines, is so neurotically obsessed with climbing the social ladder that even when she is at the very top she is dissatisfied because she can see still another rung she would like to attain.  Money is not her sole objective; there are less tangible rewards like prestige, flattery, her name mentioned with admiration in the society pages and in dinner conversations, and possibly--but not necessarily--love, of which she, like Madame Bovary, seems incapable.  \\"The Custom of the Country\\" is not Wharton's version of Flaubert's novel, though; it is the curious and intricate psychological construction of a woman with a bizarre addiction that only worsens as her situation improves.     <br /> <br />We first meet Undine as a young woman in New York, where she is living with her parents in a swank hotel suite in the upper West Side.  Her father is an entrepreneur who has earned a small fortune in the Spraggs' Midwestern hometown of Apex City and has decided to move his family to New York so that his daughter may enter high society, which, as it turns out, is guarded by an almost impenetrable barrier of snobbery.  However, with the help of a high-class manicurist named Mrs. Heeny and her own beauty and charm, Undine is able to make the acquaintance of some of the city's most fashionable families. <br /> <br />Thus Undine embarks on a twisted odyssey through the jungles of high society, first marrying a young man named Ralph Marvell, scion of a prominent New York family.  Ralph is a nice guy but too much the romantic and not quite rich enough to entertain her in the way she demands, and so he is forced to put aside his dream of becoming a writer and take a lifeless job in a real estate firm to support her.  Like the mischievously seductive water nymph that is her mythical namesake, Undine draws her adoring poet into a bittersweet affair that ultimately destroys him while she proceeds to other men with greater promise--the ugly but wealthy Peter Van Degen, the gallant French count Raymond de Chelles, the shady schemer Elmer Moffatt. <br /> <br />Like a portraitist who uses exterior details to help define the character of her subject, Wharton is keenly aware of the little things in society that create the big picture.  Undine, for example, feels entitled to everything she wants and stands up to her men (whether her father or a husband) with the indignant assertiveness of a spoiled child.  It is of no concern to her that de Chelles rebukes her for her American indifference to the European sentimental value of heirlooms when she tries to sell his tapestries, or that her neglected son Paul, oblivious to his mother's machinations, has developed no traditional familial ties and is continually moving to homes, opulent though they are, belonging to new stepfathers he barely knows.   <br /> <br />The novel's title refers to one character's theory about a man's duty to work hard for his woman without telling her anything about his work--the implication being that, in 1913 in the type of society Wharton knew, a woman was expected to rely on her husband for all her income and not to ask questions or have an opinion about how he made the money.  A single woman would have to depend on an allowance from living relatives or an inheritance from dead ones or (worst of all) have to take a job as a governess or something even more menial.  The most pressing theme of \\"The House of Mirth\\" (1905) is that there is nothing worse than being a society woman without money; \\"The Custom of the Country\\" observes what a society woman must do to ensure that she never finds herself in such a situation.    <br />	2005-04-26

In \\"The Name of the Rose,\\" Eco took several of Borges's favorite motifs--labyrinths, libraries, and murder--and whipped them into a maelstrom of a medieval mystery tale.  In \\"Foucault's Pendulum,\\" Eco again traverses Borges territory by dipping into the Kabbalah, even naming the ten sections of the novel after, and attempting to link them thematically to, the Sefirot.  What we have here is the Rabelaisian spirit filtered through the electronic age, a grand tour through Eco's erudition that makes selected stops at various esoteric points in the past seven hundred years of European history. <br /> <br />Because Eco leans so heavily on Borges, an important distinction should be made.  Borges and other polymath authors like Joyce, Mann, Pynchon, and Eco's Italian Borgesian precursor Italo Calvino are intentionally enigmatic; they don't interpret for their readers and they don't treat their readers like students.  Eco, on the other hand, like an eager professor, tends to explain everything in instructive, almost pedantic, detail (\\"Know anything about the Rosicrucians?  No, of course you don't.  I'm one of the very few who do.  Don't worry, I'll tell you all about them.\\"), which classes him with fellow academic novelists like John Barth and Robertson Davies.  This is not to imply that one type of writer is superior to the other, but the former certainly give you more room to breathe. <br /> <br />The plot of \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" involves three men--Belbo, Diotallevi, and the narrator Casaubon--who work for a Milan publishing company that specializes in books about mysticism and occult theories of history and science.  Using a computer word processor Belbo calls Abulafia and much numerological speculation, they combine random names and facts from history to reconstruct the legend of the Templars, a monastic order of Crusaders who ostensibly disbanded when their grand master, Jacques de Molay, was executed in 1314 but who are reputed to have continued as a secret society, associating with various other cults and clandestine organizations, with the intent of concealing the location of (I think I have this right) the earth's \\"navel\\"--a conduit of what are called telluric currents which harness enough energy to control the earth's natural forces. <br /> <br />None of Eco's three protagonists really distinguishes himself as a character, except that Diotallevi is a superficial Kabbalist and Belbo's motivation in life derives from his boyhood desire to play the trumpet.  They are adequately convincing, however, as scholarly researchers performing intellectual detective work to determine that the titular pendulum is a tool for locating the geonavel.  It is when the the story is reduced to a physical quest that the seams start to strain, and the climactic scene, which would not be out of place in an Indiana Jones movie, seems feeble and odd after so much convoluted setup and fails to deliver a fair payoff.    <br /> <br />The text is mostly dialogue, a continuous exchange of information between one character and one or more others, a sort of call-and-response method of narration which gives the novel a conversational tone but also seems a little contrived--is this what book editors really sound like when they talk shop?  Nevertheless, because of this technique the novel has neither the pace nor the mien of a generic thriller; it is more like a staged lecture about worldwide religious conspiracies, a pantheistic convocation of all of man's attempts to learn the secrets of the universe.  \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" is exasperatingly garrulous and not quite as clever as it thinks it is, but at a time when literature should encourage curiosity rather than avoid mental challenges, the effort is very much appreciated.  <br />	2005-04-22

As the novel begins, he is a refugee from his native village of Josefov, the site of a recent massacre by the Cossacks in which his wife and children have been murdered, and has been sold into slavery to a Polish farmer named Jan Bzik.  The moronic, raffish gentiles in the village treat him like vermin, but Bzik's beautiful daughter Wanda shows him sympathy and is curious about his religion.  As he teaches her about the Torah and Jewish law, they fall in love, both knowing that such an affair is dangerous. <br /> <br />Jacob's captivity ends after some years when his freedom is bought, which allows him to return to his own people.  However, his love for Wanda thrusts him into a dilemma which causes him to question the strength of his convictions.  He marries Wanda and persuades her to take the Hebrew name of Sarah before they settle in a new Jewish town called Pilitz.  Because she is not yet fluent in the Yiddish he has taught her, and her speech would betray a Polish gentile accent, she decides to feign muteness.  These measures are necessary because of the potential penalties involved: Wanda faces execution by the Polish government if she is discovered to have converted to Judaism; Jacob could be excommunicated for marrying a gentile, even a convert.     <br /> <br />The plot sounds almost like that of a comedy in which the woman must put on an absurd act to hide her true identity from her neighbors, but \\"The Slave\\" is adamantly and morbidly serious about its themes.  One is that Jacob, a learned man who is trusted as a teacher in his community, is obligated to uphold the Jewish law to the letter yet cannot deny his sincere love for his new wife.  Another is the hypocrisy of the Jewish elders of Pilitz who pretend piety but do not hesitate to rob each other blind when the opportunity presents itself.  Additionally, Singer colorfully portrays life in Poland at this time in history and the role of Jews in the establishment of its commerce and economic vitality.   <br /> <br />A keeper of an ancient and unique storytelling tradition, Singer, who died in 1991, is the most famous of the \\"modern\\" Yiddish writers and may be the last great one.  \\"The Slave,\\" while perhaps too simplistic compared to his masterful short stories, is characteristic of his literary mystique and typical of his concern with what it means to be a Jew and how a man should conduct himself in this world.   <br /> <br />	2005-04-18

Even in the Victorian era King Arthur had a secure place in the popular imagination, so Tennyson's poem, published in sections over roughly a fifteen-year period, was warmly received.  Because it is bookended by dedications to Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, whom Tennyson perhaps viewed as quasi-Arthurian figures just as Virgil exalted Augustus Caesar, it carries the authority of an accepted British cultural document. <br /> <br />Tennyson recasts the individual stories of the knights in his own poetic vision, and in some instances invents his own anecdotes or contributes his own details, merging chivalric imagery with post-Romantic lyrical beauty.  As an Arthurian medium, Tennyson's verse is much more readable than Malory's cumbersome prose (a forgivable style owing to Malory's time, but difficult to appreciate nowadays unless you have a taste for the archaic).  As irresistibly dazzling as a hyperbole like \\"The wood is nigh as full of thieves as leaves\\" is, there is much more to the \\"Idylls\\" than linguistic elegance.    <br /> <br />Arthur is nearly a Christ-figure, and his knights are not unlike the apostles: \\"[F]ollow the Christ, the King,/Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the King--/Else, wherefore born?\\" the idealistic Gareth rhetorically asks his mother just before journeying to Camelot to fulfill his dream of joining the Round Table.  Knighthood is a mission in life, a devotion to the service of God and the king (or King, to use the Christian allegory).  In the Arthurian milieu, knights represent the highest, most virtuous ideal of mankind, though in practice they occasionally fail, falter, and face moral dilemmas that help to build character.  Such conflicts also compel the poem, for an infallible knight hardly makes for interestingreading. <br /> <br />To be sent on a quest is not a chore but an honor of which a knight must be deemed worthy by Arthur.  Prove yourself inept, and he won't even send you to the McDonald's drive-thru to pick him up a Big Mac.  Whether rescuing a lady from a castle guarded by evil knights (Gareth), delivering a diamond as a prize to the winner of a joust (Gawain), searching for the Holy Grail (Galahad), or even properly disposing of the sword Excalibur upon Arthur's death (Bedivere), a knight is expected to obey and succeed.     <br /> <br />The vicissitudes of love often pose ethical challenges for the knights and provide the most memorable scenes of the poem, as adultery, jealousy, and betrayal set the stage for turbulent drama.  The illicit affair of Lancelot and Guinevere, Arthur's wife, the tragic story of Elaine, the peasant girl who pledges her love to Lancelot, the punishment meted out to Tristram by his uncle Mark for the seduction of Isolt, and Pelleas's amorous pursuit of the hellion Ettarre, are the essence of legend.   <br /> <br />The tale that somehow haunts me the most is that of Merlin and Vivien, which ominously takes place in a forest just before a storm.  The petulant Vivien disparages Arthur's knights and tries to coax a love spell out of the ancient but apparently still libidinous wizard; having achieved her objective as the storm breaks, she runs away from the beguiled and sleeping magician as the uttered word \\"fool\\" echoes through the trees--a very poetic representation of lust subduing and fleeing wisdom. <br /> <br />	2005-04-15

The author paints a broad canvas of easily identifiable motifs: swamps simmering in the humidity, snakes slithering through decaying plantations and abandoned hotels from a bygone era, overgrown weeds in neglected gardens, haunted ponds, voodoo charms, carnival freaks, garishly decorated interiors, loudly ticking parlor clocks, brain-damaged invalids confined to stuffy bedrooms.  The mood is so perfectly established that the skeletons in the closet could be literal rather than figurative.     <br /> <br />Joel Harrison Knox, a thirteen-year-old boy from New Orleans, is summoned by a letter--written in a suspiciously childish hand--to live with his father Edward Sansom, whom he hasn't seen since birth, and stepmother Amy Skully at her ancestral home called Skully's Landing, which turns out to be a dismal dwelling, a dilapidated antebellum mansion with no indoor plumbing or electricity.  The residents, all of whom constantly evade Joel's questions about his absent father's whereabouts, are equally disturbing: Amy, alternately zombie-like and incoherently cranky, seems to be suffering from some form of schizophrenia; her cousin Randolph converses in the theatrically enigmatic manner of a demented circus ringmaster with something sinister up his sleeve; and a fervent black maidservant called Zoo brandishes an awful scar encircling her neck.  In addition to all this grotesquerie, one day Joel sees a mysterious white-haired old lady in one of the upper-story windows--a prisoner, or just an apparition?   <br /> <br />Like harmless monsters, these people are more benign than they appear, which is not to say they aren't hiding dark secrets.  As Capote embellishes his narrative, the sense of foreboding in the beginning of the novel gradually transforms itself into a psychologically complex tapestry, a surreal coming-of-age story.  Joel experiences something approaching a first love when he encounters a brutish tomboy named Idabel and her much more feminine twin sister Florabel; the choice he makes between the two may indicate the direction of his developing sexuality.  An impressive debut for an author as young as Capote, \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\" eschews Faulkneresque experimentalism in favor of grandiose lyricism in its bizarre romance about a boy confronting ghosts from the past while struggling against the demons in the present that will shape his life. <br /> <br />	2005-04-07

In his debut novel \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread,\\" a relatively young English widow named Lilia Herriton goes to Italy at the advice of her deceased husband Charles's family, accompanied by her friend Caroline Abbott, and, in a quaint little town called Monteriano, falls in love with an even younger hustler named Gino Carella and plans to marry him.  The news mortifies her former in-laws: How could our Lilia marry a man beneath her class, the idle son of a dentist (a profession not highly regarded by the snobs in those days), a Catholic?   <br /> <br />Philip Herriton, Lilia's ex-brother-in-law, is immediately dispatched to Monteriano to put a stop to this fiasco, but it's too late; the wedding has already happened, and Philip returns to England with Caroline.  Lilia, eager to adjust her life to this poor but picturesque provincial Italian town, finds the social environment completely alien to the one to which she is accustomed in England, and even worse is the fact that Gino, whose friends are impressed that he has been able to score a rich blond Englishwoman, is revealed to be lazy and adulterous.  The worst is finally realized when Lilia dies in childbirth delivering a son to Gino. <br /> <br />Back in England, the Herritons' connection to Lilia is not so easily broken; a daughter named Irma from her first husband has been left in their care, even though Lilia had been treated with condescension by her mother-in-law and her sister-in-law Harriet while she was married to Charles.  Concerned with scandal, the Herritons recoil in fear when, a few months after Lilia's death, Irma receives postcards from Monteriano signed by her \\"little brother.\\"  Philip, his sister Harriet, and Caroline, all convinced of Gino's unsuitableness as a father, especially of a child of English blood, return to Italy to try to retrieve the baby boy.  <br /> <br />The obvious satire of cavalier Edwardian English attitudes toward CatholicEurope is only a backdrop to the more specific issue of whether the Herritons should assume custody of a baby with whom they have no legal familial relations.  Caroline, who begins to sympathize with Gino, puts it to Philip most clearly:  \\"Do you want the child to stop [stay] with his father, who loves him and will bring him up badly, or do you want him to come to Sawston [the English town where the Herritons live], where no one loves him, but where he will be brought up well?\\"  Caroline means well, of course, but her presumption that Gino would necessarily bring the boy up \\"badly\\" is part of the satire.    <br /> <br />Like Oscar Wilde with a social conscience, Forster writes admirable prose and devises witty barbs that are the soul of subtlety, but \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\" ultimately disappoints as its focus unravels.  The dilemma that Forster has been so careful in constructing ends in an avoidable tragedy, the aftermath of which is treated rather sloppily in an unconvincing attempt to rectify the plot into a happy ending.  It is frustrating that this sensitive and meticulous author, whose best novels (\\"Howards End\\" and \\"A Passage to India\\") are masterpieces, could be so frivolous in his early days, but perhaps he needed time to find his proper tone. <br /> <br />	2005-04-03

In Nikos Kazantzakis's \\"Zorba the Greek,\\" he becomes the close friend of the nameless narrator, who is lucky enough to make his acquaintance and hires him to be a foreman in his lignite mine in Crete.  Zorba is in his sixties but still spry, lean, and tall, a jack-of-all-trades who has traveled extensively throughout the Balkans and western Asia, and an indulgent lover of wine, women, and song.  He works hard and he plays hard, if you'll pardon the cliche.       As the narrator (whom Zorba simply calls \\"boss\\") and Zorba develop a working relationship as the mine becomes operational with the aid of Zorba's organizational and managerial skills, the notion emerges that the two men are complementary halves of the same personality.  The narrator is a book-learned and deeply spiritual man devoted to both Dante and Buddha; the former representing his contemplation of death and the afterlife, the latter his efforts to relinquish his sexual and material lusts in his discontentment with the earthly life.  Zorba, on the other hand, irreligious and lacking formal education, learns solely from his experiences and his adventures and believes in living as though as every minute were his last, not that he is reckless or self-destructive or mindlessly hedonistic.  The narrator is concerned with the metaphysical whereas Zorba is immersed only in the pleasures of the physical world.        Although much about Zorba's character is defined by private pains in his past, he functions primarily as a social animal who leaves a strong impression on just about everyone he meets.  He plays at seducing an elderly French lady named Dame Hortense, a former cabaret singer whose legendary beauty has been ravaged by time and who is sadly deluded into thinking he plans to marry her.  An unsavory incident at a corrupt monastery exposes him as the craftiest of opportunists, yet he displays heroism when he tries to protect a dishonored widow from being murdered by outraged villagers.  Far from the geriatric stereotype of being set in his ways, he is as many different kinds of men as he wants or needs to be as the situation requires.  \\"I think I must have five or six demons inside me!\\" he excitedly tells his boss, who agrees that we all do.    This very nicely written novel abounds with rhetoric about the Meaning of Life, which Zorba and the narrator presume to discuss without knowing the answers, but language and metaphor are more important here than the ontological content.  The narrator is constantly seeing signs of God and symbols of life in the delicacy and mutability of nature, from butterflies to birds to flowers to the color of the sea; Zorba has taught him to learn by observing the world around him in addition to just reading the words of others.  So uniquely spirited and inspiriting is this book that it would sing and dance like Zorba if it could.	2005-04-02

Given her innocence and purity, it is not difficult to guess from the outset that, no matter what obstacles are thrust in her way, Fanny will ultimately triumph and enjoy the Austenian reward for personal virtue, a blissful marriage.<br /><br />Fanny, a little girl from a poor family, is invited to live with her wealthy uncle and aunt, the Bertrams, and grow up with her cousins at their estate which gives the novel its title.  Her reticence and plainness immediately alienate her from her socially active and radiant cousins Maria and Julia, and she shows no special mental aptitude, as her other aunt, Mrs. Norris, a parson's widow who now lives at Mansfield Park, smugly notices.  Fortunately, her cousin Edmund, who is studying to be a clergyman, is sympathetic to her and tries to make her feel like one of the family.<br /><br />A brother and sister, Henry and Mary Crawford, enter and catalyze the plot as they quickly befriend the Bertrams.  Cheerful, carefree, and irresponsible, Henry flirts egregiously with the Bertram girls, even though Maria is engaged to marry a rich young man named Rushworth.  Mary, a talented harpist, is far from angelic--she is tactless, irreverent, scheming, and selfish, but she wears it all with a bright smile.  Deriding the presence of a chapel in a private home, she is sternly reproached by Edmund, to whom she has taken a liking and of whose vocational goal she was previously unaware; whereupon she pressures him to pursue instead the more lucrative and prestigious profession of law.<br /><br />After a ball in which Fanny sheds her ugly duckling feathers for those of a graceful swan, Henry casts his attention towards her and professes his love; but she spurns him, finding their personalities incompatible.She feels some guilt over this because Henry has helped her brother William get a promotion in the Navy; and her uncle Sir Thomas, stunned by her refusal and believing that Henry would make an honorable and desirable husband, tries to persuade her to accept.  The persistence of an unwanted suitor--a motif that recurs in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Emma\\"--must have struck Austen as an amusingly dire predicament for a young lady.<br /><br />The novel has an interesting antagonist in the form of Mrs. Norris, who thinks of Fanny as the redheaded stepchild in the otherwise beautiful Bertram household.  The humor in this situation is that everybody (except Fanny, who won't defend herself) is apparently oblivious to this woman's insidiousness, which allows her to go about spreading her sourness at will without fear of reproof.  Every time she opens her mouth, it is to disparage Fanny with some surreptitiously hurtful remark that backhandedly praises her pretty cousins.  One gets the sense that Austen was projecting somebody she particularly disliked into the character of Mrs. Norris.<br /><br />Like Austen's other major novels, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is a grandly designed drama about the interrelationship of love, marriage, money, and society in nineteenth-century England, in this case with a likeable heroine who doesn't try to be cute and is perhaps a little too passive for her own good.  All the other Austen elements are in place, including her patented sarcasm and the happy ending which she justifies by \\"let[ting] other pens dwell on guilt and misery,\\" but regardless of predictability her expertise in constructing monumental fictions cannot be denied.	2005-03-25

It's interesting that most authors who write fiction about the state of death portray it as simply a transcended, and usually idealized, form of life, but then again from what other source can they draw their material?  Death is the one thing that can't be researched.   <br /> <br />\\"The Living End\\" begins with what looks like a conventional plot, telling the story of a hapless ordinary man named Ellerbee who owns a liquor store in Minneapolis, has a nagging wife whom he loves nonetheless, and is loyally charitable to his employees.  One day he is shot and killed by armed robbers and is spirited away to Heaven--which, although every bit the antiseptic paradise it is rumored, appears in the form of a theme park, like an ecclesiastical Disney World--and then is told, without explanation, that he is being sent directly to Hell.   <br /> <br />Hell is total anarchy and chaos, people constantly brutalizing each other or wandering around aimlessly with no structure or schedule to their existence, ultimately desensitized to their environment.  After sixty-two years in the inferno--long enough for a guy to deserve to know why he's been sent there--Ellerbee learns that his sentence is a result of having broken some of the more easily breakable commandments, leaving him to ponder the absurdity of having to spend eternity in the abyss for having operated his business on the Sabbath. <br /> <br />In Hell, Ellerbee eventually meets his murderer's accomplice, a man named Ladlehaus who made a great living as a criminal but met his end when the plug was pulled on him while he was in a coma.  Through an odd set of circumstances his grave was located in a high school stadium, where the groundskeeper, a man named Quiz, believed the dead man was speaking to him.  Quiz, the hilariously perverse protagonist of the novel's second act, imagines the Twin Cities are engaged in a civil war and persuades little boys to play soldiers for him.   <br /> <br />The novel comes full circle in Heaven, where Mary, who contemplates the experience of having borne a child while remaining a virgin, and Joseph, who feels cuckolded by God over said child, have reunited with Jesus in a skewed family portrait.  God, frustrated with the empty and vain tributes of religion, man's idea of adoration of the divine, gives a \\"gala\\" in which, like a temperamental and narcissistic artist berating a public apathetic to his work, he explains the rationale behind his universe and makes his fearsome final decision.  Elkin surely wishes he knew the secrets he pretends God to disclose, but he doesn't cheat his reader--the force and style of his expression are more than worth the time and trouble of \\"The Living End.\\"   <br />	2005-03-19

In a city called Grusinia, the Governor is executed in a coup and his wife flees for her life, abandoning their baby son Michael, who is picked up by a humble kitchen maid named Grusha.  Having recently betrothed herself to a soldier named Simon who is away on duty, she sets out on a cross-country journey with the infant to get help from her brother, a farmer in a distant village. <br /> <br />Lavrenti, her brother, suggests she get married immediately to avoid suspicion that the baby is hers out of wedlock, and the most available candidate is a local wretched peasant.  After living with this man for a couple of years, Grusha is apprehended by soldiers who have come to take young Michael, the sole heir of the deposed Governor's estate, back to Grusinia.  The case of Michael's custody, contested by the Governor's wife against Grusha, is brought to trial, where the judge, a drunk named Azdak whose unofficial appointment to this position is a farce, decrees that the boy will be placed inside a circle drawn with chalk on the courtroom floor, and that the woman who is able to pull him out of the circle is the real mother.  (Study the judge's exact words when you read this.) <br /> <br />Although the story is of medieval Chinese origin, Brecht's play is a sort of refashioning of the Biblical anecdote about Solomon and expands the idea by supplying a whole backstory to the women's argument.  Solomon's judgment is accepted because his wisdom is universally considered to be impeccable, but what of a man like Azdak who functions on whim more than on wisdom?  The ending is subtly brilliant in the sense that the outcome of the contest is subject to semantic debate (whether you think the judgment is fair or logical or contradictory depends on how closely you read the judge's words), but also in the question of irony or sincerity in the suggestion that true justice will be conferred by nature rather than by man.    <br />	2005-03-17

The novel itself begins with a bang--in the air, as a commercial jet traveling from Bombay to London explodes over the English Channel, sending all its passengers plummeting earthward, and proceeds from this ominous introduction to tell a multitude of fabulous stories linking the ancient with the modern.      <br /> <br />The two protagonists, Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha, both Indian Muslims, both actors of unequal fame and fortune, both tied socially, culturally, and romantically to England, are among the passengers on the hapless plane and miraculously survive the descent, affected by the near-death experience in very different ways.  Gibreel, who became India's most famous movie star playing elephant- or monkey-headed gods in \\"theological\\" films, is convinced he is \\"born again\\" and hallucinates that he is the archangel Gibreel, dictating divine decrees to a prophet in a cave and monitoring a pilgrimage to Mecca, and then that he is the exterminating angel Azraeel, who roams the streets of a riotous London sounding his horn of death. <br /> <br />Saladin, on the surface so much like Gibreel, becomes his antithesis and even his nemesis after certain revelations.  Desiring to escape his ridiculous parents, Saladin came to London from Bombay at thirteen to attend school, became a struggling actor whose only employment opportunities were in campy commercials and television shows, and married a brittle English woman.  After the aerial calamity and detainment by sadistic immigration officers, he undergoes a bizarre metamorphosis before discovering that his wife is having an affair with his old college friend Jumpy Joshi, a former nerdy radical who nowteaches martial arts.  <br /> <br />Gibreel's phantasmagorical dreams take him centuries back to a city called Jahilia in an unnamed desert where a vociferous businessman named Mahound receives holy messages from a visitant angel (Gibreel), assumes the role of a prophet instructed by God, and founds a religion called \\"Submission.\\"  The city's Grandee, threatened by this man's rising influence among the citizens, commands the poet Baal to satirize Mahound in verse and oppresses the adherents of the new religion until they flee Jahilia.  After many years in exile, Mahound returns to Jahilia in a position of power, usurps control of the city, overturns its polytheism in deference to \\"Submission,\\" and sentences Baal to death for mocking him, taunting the poet with an insinuatingly snide parting statement as guards drag him away to be executed.  <br /> <br />A separate but related narrative tells of a contemporary pilgrimage to Mecca by a village of Indian Muslims led a bewitching girl named Ayesha who says they must travel only on foot and persuades them that the waters of the Arabian Sea will part for them to cross.  The village zamindar (landholder) thinks this is madness and tries to stop them, especially his wife, who believes the pilgrimage will cure her terminal cancer.  A wonderful tale of miracles, faith, and tragedy ensues in which Rushdie contrasts rural and urban Indian life and the vestiges of British colonial India. <br /> <br />Although his scenes often tend to the macabre or the violent, Rushdie is at heart a comedian, making his novel funnier than it needs to be by giving his characters and their actions almost cartoonish dimensions to respond to the outlandish world they inhabit.  In a sense he is following the tradition of the English comic picaresque novelists of the eighteenth century, imagining great landscapes of the wildest possibilities and conjuring panoramic perspectives of being an Indian in England, of being a Muslim in India, of being an angel on earth or in your mind.  Just beware that, as one character says, metaphors can and will be misinterpreted. <br /> <br />	2005-03-15

Milton, however, does something remarkable the Bible doesn't do--he inflates Satan from a mere flat symbol of evil into a complex personality that enlivens his identity as the principal enemy of God, Jesus, and man.  Who is Satan, where did he come from, why does he do the things he does, and, most importantly, why is he an indispensable part of the Christian myth?  Milton takes the initiative of asking and answering these questions. <br /> <br />Divided into twelve \\"books,\\" \\"Paradise Lost\\" begins with a war in Heaven instigated by the angel Lucifer who, with the help of many rebellious cohorts, tries to wrest control of the celestial kingdom from God.  Like a school principal putting kids in detention for starting a food fight in the cafeteria, God deals swiftly and severely with the miscreants, hurling them \\"headlong flaming from the ethereal sky/With hideous ruin and combustion down/To bottomless perdition, there to dwell/In adamantine chains and penal fire.\\"  That's powerful stuff.   <br /> <br />The rebel angels, now transformed into devils for their treachery, are imprisoned in Hell, a hot, smelly, miserable place, with Lucifer (now named Satan) their lord to dwell in a palace called Pandemonium--the place of all demons.  Milton assigns names of heathen gods to the devils and allows three of them to offer advice on the proper course of action for the hell-bound.  The bellicose Moloch insists on resuming war with Heaven, the rational Belial believes a peaceful acceptance of their sentence will eventually restore them to God's good graces, and the pragmatic Mammon suggests they should establish and rule Hell as their new dominion rather than return to Heaven as servants.  But Satan has another idea--to travel through Chaos (the dark, lifeless void connecting the realms) to Earth to corrupt Man, the new being with whom God plans to replace the expelled angels in Heaven.    <br /> <br />Satan would be uninteresting if he were no more than a fist-shaking, teeth-gnashing villain, but Milton endows this vilest of creatures with the most human of consciences.  While on his nefarious mission, as he rapturously views the luxuriant Eden, he laments, \\"O sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams/That bring to my remembrance from what state/I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;\\" and the jealousy mixed with sorrow is palpable.  He knows he did wrong and momentarily regrets his misbehavior, but he also knows that there can never be a reconciliation between him and God, and therefore resigns himself to be forever the king of evil and vie for man's soul.  It is here that Satan eavesdrops (pun not intended) on Adam and Eve talking about the Tree of Knowledge, the fruit of which they are forbidden to eat. <br /> <br />Regarding the Tree of Knowledge, the poem inevitably raises the issue of entrapment.  What is the purpose of the Tree?  Simply that God demands obedience, and obedience can be tested only if there exists something to provide an opportunity to disobey.  The material component of this opportunity is the Tree; the human component is the Tempter, who of course is Satan.  Jesus, as narrated in \\"Paradise Regained,\\" is the exemplary resister of Temptation, rejecting Satan's offer of world domination and his challenges to test his faith in God by turning stones to bread and casting himself from the top of the temple's spire.  Through embellishment and dramatization, Milton makes ideas like these more explicit in the \\"Paradise Lost/Regained\\" poems than they are in the Bible. <br /> <br />Completely blind by the time he wrote these poems, John Milton was a man of strong but curious convictions--he defended the freedom of the press, but he lauded Cromwell and condoned regicide.  As poems, \\"Paradise Lost/Regained\\" can be read as sacred, reflecting much of English religious thinking of the seventeenth century, or as heroic, subtly illustrating Milton's assiduous efforts to reform religion and government.  But regardless of its subtext, it's no wonder that \\"Paradise Lost\\" has become one of the most celebrated accomplishments in the English language--the book of Genesis could not have been re-imagined more vividly, more terrifyingly, more beautifully.     <br /> <br />	2005-03-06
US	49396726	R126UJOJB24GUR	0679724532	275081924	The Gnostic Gospels	Books	4	36	41	N	N	Good overview of gnosticism	Gnosticism is a term seen frequently in modern literary criticism, but nobody ever bothers to explain what it is exactly; even dictionaries and encyclopedias offer only murky definitions in uncertain terms.  Is it a philosophy, a religion, a cult, a method, or simply a devotion to the pursuit of wisdom?  Elaine Pagels's treatise \\"The Gnostic Gospels\\" goes a long way towards answering this question by not only providing an informative introduction to the concept of gnosticism but discussing its controversial relation to the history of Christianity.      The principle of gnosticism can be stated very loosely that knowledge of God is attained through knowledge of the self.  (This clarifies its connection to literature, the reading and writing of which is the ultimate examination of the self.)  An innocent idea, but not one conciliatory to religions organized around fixed clerical hierarchies.  The gnostic Christians of the early centuries of the Common Era rejected certain institutional doctrines and particularly the authority of the governing figures of the orthodox, or catholic (that is, universal), church.  The orthodox bishops, deacons, and priests, who established their authority by claiming discipleship of the original apostles, condemned the Gnostics as heretics for deviating from orthodoxy by raising questions about whether God is a female as well as a male figure, whether the resurrection should be interpreted literally or symbolically, and whether martyrdom is a legitimate emulation of the passion.        Pagels bases her book on research of several gnostic texts that were discovered in 1945 sealed in a jar buried near Nag Hammadi in Egypt.  Hidden probably to prevent their destruction by church censors, these texts comprise gospels other than the four that are canonized in the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and which raise the questions mentioned above.  Other, but few, gnostic texts had survived expurgation by the early orthodox church, but the Nag Hammadi texts represent the most concentrated body of gnostic works found to date.  Pagels tries to identify a common ground among these texts that qualify them all as \\"gnostic,\\" while acknowledging that gnosticism is not solely a Judeo-Christian offshoot, having some similarities to, and possibly roots in, Hindu and Buddhist teachings.        \\"The Gnostic Gospels\\" is short but thorough, each chapter discussing a crucial topic that was a source of conflict between the gnostics and the orthodox clergy.  Although in tone it defends gnosticism from the intolerance of the early church fathers, Pagels stresses that she does not champion gnosticism over traditional Christianity, but as a historian she is obligated to study the available evidence in the formation of the dominant religion of the West.  In this context, her book serves to highlight an underservedly obscure phenomenon in our cultural history.	2005-03-01

France, like the most of the rest of the world, is now a very different place.  The Dreyfus affair is receding into the past under the shadow of the new war that has descended upon Europe, with Germany having ravaged Belgium and threatening to destroy London and Paris.   <br /> <br />Many of the people with whom Marcel has associated throughout his life and whom we came to know so intimately through the pages of his chronicle are now dead, whether by disease, accident, old age, or the war.  Those among the living  include the Baron de Charlus, who sympathizes with the Germans and frequents a hotel that serves as a male brothel; Bloch, who has de-Judaicized his name and has assumed an English chic; and Odette and her daughter Gilberte, the latter now herself a mother, who have not so gracefully weathered the effects of aging.    <br /> <br />Marcel himself is now an adult of at least middle age, and, as far as he is concerned, still no closer to achieving his goal of becoming a writer as he was in his youth.  He has, however, started writing articles and comes to realize, as he reflects on the course of his life, that the intricate web of contacts he has made can serve as grist for his literary mill, should he decide in his waning days to take up a pen and make some contribution to letters.  And, of course, over the past four thousand pages that is exactly what his author has done.  Marcel muses on Time (capitalization intended), memory, and dreams as necessary elements in the creation of art, a product of so much personal pain and suffering that death can seem like a welcome reprieve.   <br /> <br />Judging the novel as a whole now that I've finished all six volumes, I affirm that there is nothing like it, or even close to it, in literature; like \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"Don Quixote\\" it resides in its own impenetrable legendary world of oneness.  In my review of \\"Swann's Way,\\" I compared Proust to Henry James, but I see now that I was way off the mark.  James writes like he's throwing his weight around, imperiously demanding intellectual respect and forcing his reader into submission with his intentionally inscrutable compositions; Proust's prose, conversely, calmly and warmly invites the reader into Marcel's society and caresses him with the most delicate sensations and deepest emotions.  Proust is closer to Henry Adams than he is to Henry James, but even this attempted juxtaposition is buffered by a wide margin.  <br /> <br />Proust's style is so ornate that it is the most difficult of any writer's to describe, yet paradoxically there is nothing affected about it; he is quite possibly the most unpretentious writer in literature.  He never tries to impress the reader with his erudition, even though he evidently has much, or make himself out to be something he's not; one gets the sense that what he writes is exactly what and how he thinks, as incredible as that seems.  He uses humor without trying to be a comedian, sorrow without trying to be a tragedian.  He is employing language simply to illustrate life and the world, and I think language has no higher calling than that.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-27

In some ways \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" is the last of a literary species, that which saw its pinnacle with Anthony Trollope's Victorian chronicles of the middle class and exhausted itself as George Eliot pushed the genre so far past its limits that it had nothing else to do but yield to modernism.  Galsworthy, however, does not veer from the traditional style.  His saga of a fictional family, intended to represent the English upper middle class (as they are repeatedly and emphatically described), is a compilation of three novels and two short interludes, the entirety completed in 1922, the narrative covering the waning Victorian era and the societal changes that occurred throughout the Edwardian era and the first World War.   <br /> <br />Thorny and extensive as the Forsyte family tree is, Galsworthy concentrates mainly on a few selected characters and one story line to guide the saga.  It begins with a party showing the Forsytes \\"in full plumage\\" as they celebrate the engagement of June, the granddaughter of \\"Old\\" Jolyon Forsyte, the family's current living patriarch, to the architect Philip Bosinney, who has been hired by old Jolyon's nephew, Soames Forsyte, a solicitor, to design a new house for him and his wife Irene.  The problem is that Irene is bored with her marriage to Soames and has an affair with Bosinney and then (much later) with \\"Young\\" Jolyon, old Jolyon's son and Soames's cousin. <br /> <br />Irene's infidelity leads to her separation from Soames, who mostly wants a son to continue his lineage and implores her to return.  Her final rejection of him enables a divorce and gives him the opportunity to marry a pretty French girl named Annette, but he never relinquishes his love for Irene, and her subsequent marriage to young Jolyon causes a rift between the two cousins, exacerbated by the fact that old Jolyon had bought the house that Soames had contracted from Bosinney.  Soames and Annette have a daughter named Fleur, from whom he decides to keep his former marriage a secret, which presents a complication when Fleur accidentally meets and falls in love with Jon, the son of young Jolyon and Irene.  <br /> <br />Galsworthy rescues the story from becoming a trite soap opera by using the particular Forsyte mentality as the supporting theme.  According to young Jolyon, who is not as concerned with money as most Forsytes are, a Forsyte has \\"a sense of property\\"; that is, the Forsytes define themselves by their possessions--houses, land, commodities, wives.  Soames, the exemplary Forsyte, demonstrates this by being doomed to live a lucrative but loveless life; he is not as pathetic as he is merely typical of his class.  The Forsytes compete with each other and become jealous over trifles and perceived superiorities, but, fearful of scandals, they refrain from anything that could bring public disgrace upon the family name.  <br /> <br />When examined in the context of the contemporary cultural revolution, the saga assumes another dimension.  There is a wonderful paragraph in which Soames and Annette witness the funeral procession of Queen Victoria in 1901 and Galsworthy summarizes the \\"transmuting influence\\" of the sixty-four years of her reign, from coaches to motor-cars, the rise of the upper middle class.  In the concluding chapter, Soames further contemplates the Forsytian transition at the death of his youngest uncle, which marks the passing of the influential generation of Forsytes that included his own father and old Jolyon.  Descended from farmers, a family of merchants, lawyers, realtors, and publishers is coming full circle back to farming and gradually splintering into other families.  Eventually, only the name remains. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-21

Trilogy	Books	5	21	22	N	N	A parallel America	\\"The 42nd Parallel,\\" the first volume of John Dos Passos's \\"U.S.A.\\" trilogy, is a novel about America and Americans from the 1890s up to the first World War.  That sounds ordinary enough, but \\"The 42nd Parallel\\"--the title possibly refers to the latitude of Chicago, Dos Passos's city of birth and where a good portion of the action of the novel takes place--is notable more for its style than for its content, not that the latter is uninteresting.  Dos Passos invents five young people from different backgrounds and parts of the country and follows the courses of their lives until their destinies eventually intersect.   <br /> <br />The first to be introduced is a poor kid from Connecticut by way of Chicago named Fenian \\"Mac\\" McCreary who, starting out as an apprentice printer not unlike Benjamin Franklin, travels from city to city hopping trains and falling haplessly into a variety of odd jobs--assisting a con man, writing propaganda for a labor organization--until he ends up in Mexico running a bookstore on the fringe of a revolutionary movement.  Then we meet Janey Williams, a middle-class girl from Washington, D.C., who makes a living as a stenographer while she is looking for a husband.     <br /> <br />Next is a diligent, intelligent boy from Wilmington, Delaware, named J. Ward Moorehouse who after some bad luck in his career and his marriage becomes a successful public relations consultant for corporations.  Eleanor Stoddard, a Chicago girl who dreams of a fashionable and cultured life for herself, breaks the social and economic barriers and becomes a highly reputable interior decorator in New York.  Finally, Charley Anderson, a North Dakota native, struggles to find and keep work as a mechanic while he roams the country as a vagrant, ultimately volunteering for the ambulance corps in France as the United States enters the European war.  <br /> <br />What all these people have in common is that they each epitomize some facet of the new American socioeconomic picture of the emerging twentieth century--the socialist, the working single girl, the corporate image softener.  The novel reflects the changes America was undergoing at the time, especially in light of the problematic relations between labor, industry, and government, and the country's potential position as a new global superpower awaiting the biggest, bloodiest war the world would witness to date.  Dos Passos wrote this in 1930, so of course he had the benefit of some hindsight; there was no second world war, nor even yet the threat of one, to obscure his vision of the era.        <br /> <br />The narratives of the main characters alternate with \\"Newsreels\\" that provide glimpses of contemporary events, headlines, and snippets of popular songs; sections called \\"The Camera Eye\\" which record random prattle from snapshot subjects and look like modernist prose poems; and brief versified sketches of actual personalities and prominent figures of the day who shaped American history, from Eugene V. Debs to Thomas Edison to Charles Proteus Steinmetz.  The novel is experimental in structure, but Dos Passos is breezily conversational in his prose, telling pure stories with natural drama; there is no unbelievable comedy or tragedy here, no sentimentality or jingoism, just life as it is lived.     <br />   <br /> <br />	2005-02-15
US	49396726	R2PXJPKBYLBVBN	0192837974	176914154	Indiana (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Doll house	George Sand (nee Amantine-Aurore-Lucile Dupin) is the kind of name I've seen in the novels of more famous writers and in the footnotes of those novels, but her own suffer from a lack of visibility on the shelves of libraries and bookstores nowadays.  Reading her early novel \\"Indiana,\\" I see why she was so popular and influential in her era (admirers included George Eliot and Henry James); although she is not the equal of her contemporaries Hugo and Flaubert, her writing has plenty of momentum and is pervaded by an unprecedented psychological awareness that seems well ahead of its time.   <br /> <br />On the surface, \\"Indiana\\" is about loveless marriage, illicit romance, and the violence that results; but the characters are much more compelling and the narrative is more surprising than such a description might imply.  Sand's titular heroine, whose unusual name refers not to Hoosier enthusiasm but to her birthplace of a French colonial island in the Indian Ocean, is the nineteen-year-old wife of the wealthy industrialist Colonel Delmare, a crusty, callous retired soldier old enough to be her father, who has a nice country house in Brie.  The marriage was arranged, of course, and Indiana is miserable practically to the point of physical illness.  That her dog is named Ophelia seems to emphasize the general despair the novel has for the feminine state. <br /> <br />There are two other important men in Indiana's life.  One is her cousin Sir Ralph, an English baronet, who, trying to overcome a past filled with heartbreak, is protective of her but makes a valiant effort to remain friendly with her imperious husband.  The other man is an impetuous Lothario named Raymon de Ramiere who infiltrates the Delmare household by seducing Indiana's beautiful Creole maid Noun and then Indiana herself.  Charismatic, accustomed to adoration, Raymon is one of the most histrionic lovers in literature (\\"If only I could wash away with my blood the shame that I have left on this bed!\\"), almost comical in the intensity of his passions. <br /> <br />Given this woman and the three men who love her, it is clear that jealousy will be the strongest factor in driving the story; but the plot develops in unexpected ways, almost to the extent of a romantic fantasy that defies Sand's supposedly \\"realist\\" intentions.  However, it is interesting that she allows the various political upheavals of France at the time, coinciding with the burgeoning Industrial Revolution reflected by references to Delmare's factory, to fuel the characters' motivations; they are not just acting in a vacuum that obliviously seals itself from the outside world. <br />  <br />Despite its aesthetic qualities, \\"Indiana\\" would have problems attracting a modern readership.  Sylvia Raphael's English translation, as rich and garish as the icing on a decorated cake, seems naturally to evoke the novel's peculiar tone, that of the kind of antiquated melodrama that a parodist of period romances might try to achieve.  And yet, assuming that the novel's style is largely defined by the mores and tastes of the French society of the 1830s, I can't help but commend Sand's intellect and craftsmanship in exploring the different meanings of love.      <br /> <br />	2005-02-10
US	49396726	R1ISGIOLOBQ1ZU	0684818981	378927219	To Have and Have Not	Books	3	6	8	N	N	The haves and the have-nots	Harry Morgan, the antihero of Hemingway's \\"To Have and Have Not,\\" is a former cop from Miami who now works on the other side of the law.  He owns a small yacht and charters fishing trips for vacationers, alternating between Havana and Key West, where he lives with his wife Marie and their three daughters.  When times get tough, as they often do during the Great Depression, he supplements his income by running liquor and aliens between Cuba and Florida.  For the remainder of his short life, he endures danger, violence, and great bodily sacrifice in his rather simpleminded pursuit of the next big score.  <br /> <br />Early in the novel we see exactly what kind of operator Morgan is when he cheats and murders a Chinese businessman who has hired him to transport some immigrants.  His motive is nothing more complicated than that he needs the money and doesn't value human life very highly, especially not a stranger's.  He has little use for people who can't directly help him make money; it's not surprising that he has few friends, these being Eddy the drunk and Albert the sad sack who's digging ditches on a relief project.  He is cold (but not abusive) even to his family and apparently doesn't care much whether they live or die even though he feels a vague obligation to provide for them. <br /> <br />Hemingway contrasts the impoverished Morgans with the more affluent tourists in Key West, most of whom do not interact personally with Morgan.  The most notable subplot is the troubled marriage of the writer Richard Gordon, who is working on a novel about a labor strike, and his vixenish wife Helen; but their purpose in the novel is unclear except possibly to portray random marital discord.  All these characters, from the surly, discontented Morgan to the wealthy residents with their facades of prosperity and happiness, have one thing have in common--they are people to whom an enormous amount of liquor is an anesthetic with which to numb their miseries. <br /> <br />That Morgan is an unlikeable man is not the problem with \\"To Have and Have Not\\"; he's little more than what he seems--just a guy on a boat getting into trouble and drinking away his aimless, empty life.  Hemingway lived in Key West in the 1930s, and it can be assumed that he was inspired by the shady characters he might have seen on the docks, so I can appreciate where he was going with this novel; but it has only half a heart.  His minimalist, descriptively sparse prose and punchy dialogue work best when his characters have desires and passions deeper and more complex than money, as they do in his better novels (\\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" \\"A Farewell to Arms,\\" \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\") and short stories.  Like Hemingway's better heroes, Morgan is an adventurer, but his tragedy is that he lives only for the payoff.       <br />  <br />	2005-01-15
US	49396726	R3469WFBHAJO53	0192833847	809826371	On Liberty and Other Essays (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	4	31	31	N	N	Triumph of the individual	This Oxford collection of four definitive essays by John Stuart Mill, arguably the most famous Victorian writer who could be called a philosopher, gives an excellent profile of a rigorous social reformer and political thinker.  The subjects of these essays--liberty, utilitarianism, government, and women's rights--are interrelated to the extent that they reveal a man with a sharp sense of history and its impact on the methods and mores of contemporary society.  Mill, after all, was of Charles Dickens's generation and therefore witnessed an era in which the British crown was inclined to manifest its power through tyranny in its efforts to maintain a costly worldwide empire. <br /> <br />Mill's basic concern is liberty, both social and civil.  He identifies a difference between freedom and liberty--freedom is the state of being free, while liberty is the freedom that a government or governing body grants its people.  Briefly a member of Parliament (the workings of which are described in great detail in \\"Representative Government\\") and heavily informed and influenced by Alexis de Tocqueville's \\"Democracy in America,\\" Mill recognized that the most important (and perhaps the only proper) function of a government is to protect the liberties of its citizens.  However, people generally get the form of government they deserve; if laws they allow to go unchecked become the tools of despotic powers, they have only their own ignorance or indolence to blame.     <br />   <br />An enumeration of Mill's finer points may suffice as a summary of his ideas: <br /> <br />1. Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are essential rights of man.  You don't have to accept as true what other people say, but let them say it because there's always the chance that they're right and you're wrong.  Mill points out that even the Roman Catholic Church, most intolerant of religions (his words, not mine), allows a \\"devil's advocate\\" to offer repudiative evidence before it canonizes a new saint.  He notes instances in which religious intolerance still rears its ugly head in the British Empire of his day.   <br /> <br />2. Christianity does not have a monopoly on moral authority; literary history gives evidence of this. <br /> <br />3. Individuality should be fostered so that new ideas may flourish, but society, specifically the middle class, establishes the normative values that unfortunately tend to stifle individuality.  You have an unlimited right to your opinion, but you are free to act only so far as you do not harm or molest others.  Long before Orwell, Mill had the insight that institutional deprivation of liberty is effectively suppression of thought, for how can someone train himself to think independently when doing so could lead to persecution for heresy or treason? <br /> <br />4. State-sponsored education should restrict itself to teaching scientifically provable or reliably documented facts rather than push religious or political agenda.  When or if polemical issues are raised, arguments for and against are to be presented as opinions so that students may draw their own conclusions. <br /> <br />5. The utilitarian principle states that actions that promote happiness (in its most obvious form, pleasure) are \\"right\\" and those that reduce happiness are \\"wrong\\"--in other words, utilitarianism is the opposite of puritanism.  Consider how much better it is to be a dissatisfied human being than a satisfied pig, because the human has the potential for so much more happiness than the pig, whose breadth of experience is contained entirely between the trough and the slaughterhouse, could ever know. <br /> <br />6. Women deserve the same rights as men because the social and mental limitations attributed to women are for the most part a male-conceived artifice.  Chivalry is a fallacy.   <br /> <br />And so on.  I'm not sure if it's correct to call Mill a libertarian in modern terms, but he was certainly concerned with the issues with which modern libertarians are concerned.  Much of his discourse is relevant to today's world, even though he often draws upon the past for contrast in order to make his conclusions, the implication being that improvement comes with increased knowledge and experience.  Anyone who is interested in nineteenth-century thought on democracy and individualism will find much to ponder in Mill's eloquence.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-11

In \\"Zuckerman Unbound,\\" which takes place in Manhattan in 1969, Nathan Zuckerman, a simulacrum of Roth himself, is an author who has just published a commercially and critically successful novel called \\"Carnovsky,\\" which seems very similar to \\"Portnoy's Complaint.\\"  Hesitant to adjust to his new life as a millionaire, he continues to live like a schlub, riding the bus and eating in cheap delicatessens, even though his face has been on the cover of Life magazine and people recognize him in public.    <br /> <br />Fame has its disadvantages; Zuckerman is besieged by letters and solicitations from fans, freaks, and creeps, especially the thug who keeps phoning him threatening to kidnap his mother for ransom.  One day he meets a fellow Newark native named Alvin Pepler, a burly but obsequious and tirelessly garrulous man who is trying to write a book about his unlucky involvement in a quiz show scandal in the fifties and seeks Zuckerman's help in getting it published and advice about writing in general.  The nonchalant but slightly amused manner in which Zuckerman reacts to the possibly psychopathic Pepler, who quickly becomes defensive after he asks for (and receives) criticism, is one of the novel's enjoyable subtleties.     <br /> <br />Zuckerman's love life is an aching echo of his fictional Carnovsky's.  His marital record is extremely shaky; he is twice divorced and currently separated from his wife Laura, a lawyer who defends draft dodgers evading Vietnam.  His fame allows him an otherwise improbable consort--the voluptuous but aging Irish actress Caesara O'Shea, who is growing bored with all the attention she gets even while her star is slowly fading.  \\"I feel like the out-of-focus signpost in a news photo of a head-on collision,\\" he tells her, acknowledging the meagerness of his appearance juxtaposed with her radiance. <br /> <br />One important thing Zuckerman must face is the psychological effect of the notoriety of his erotic novel on his family, particularly when he and his younger brother Henry fly down to the retirement community in Florida where their parents now live to be at the bedside of their dying father.  Zuckerman's mother worships him and thinks he can do no wrong; it is Henry who decides to slap him with guilt when they return home.  Henry, after all, was the \\"good son,\\" the sensible one who became a dentist, married a nice girl he didn't really love, and despite his clandestine extramarital affairs would never write a book like \\"Carnvosky\\" filled with sexual depravity and Jewish self-ridicule.    <br /> <br />I suppose there was a time (say, in Charles Dickens's day) when novelists enjoyed the same kind of celebrity as movie stars do today, but this notion seems quaint by Zuckermanian standards.  An author must write a \\"Carnovsky/Portnoy's Complaint\\" to be noticed because in this age a \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or a \\"Wuthering Heights\\" doesn't have quite the same visual impact.  \\"Zuckerman Unbound\\" reveals a Philip Roth who perhaps is wistful about a cultural consciousness which books play a more prominent role in shaping.   <br />	2005-01-05
US	49396726	R1QC9JWUU5MC64	0140188592	468027632	Gravity's Rainbow (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	The Odd-yssey of the post-Joyce era	While \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" used as a backdrop the southern California defense industry of the 1960s, \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" takes the technological angle to a brash new level which often looks like somebody tried to slip an overview of a freshman engineering curriculum into a novel about World War II military rocketry.  At one point in regard to a wind tunnel, Pynchon explains with admirable clarity and accuracy the rationale behind dimensional similitude, which is the operational basis of experimentation in all branches of fluid mechanics.  An unlikely passage in a novel, to be sure, but I'm amazed more by the author's resisting the temptation to present the Buckingham Pi theorem, of which the name alone could have been good for at least one cheap pun.      The Germans were the rocket experts in World War II, and the plot of \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" follows the fantastic adventures of U.S. Army Lieutenant Tyrone Slothrop through Blitz-torn London and postwar Europe in his involvement with the search for the design secrets of the A4 rocket Schwarzgerat, code name 00000.  Hounded by various government and military operatives from British psychologists to Soviet intelligence to the Schwarzkommando (African SS division), all seeking worldwide ballistic supremacy, he encounters everyone from hashish dealers to a Brocken neo-witch to the boorish racist Major Marvy in locations like an underground missile factory and a casino on the French Riviera.  Slothrop is as slippery and resourceful as James Bond, but this is not a formulaic espionage thriller that exhausts all its possibilities in the first few pages.    The style of \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" is a freeform burlesque in which calculus jokes, control theory, organic chemistry, electrical circuitry, and the Heisenberg principle mix with Masonic conspiracies, the story of Byron the light bulb who finds himself screwed into the most inappropriate places, vulgar limericks and song lyrics, scatology, orgies, a [...], sodomy, [...], and all sorts of debauchery.  Somewhere buried in the novel are a Maclaurin series expansion and a time-dependent second-order differential equation (a damped oscillatory system) describing yaw control, \\"that elegant blend of philosophy and hardware.\\"  The book is uniquely mystified by the synergy of mathematical grace and the brute mechanics of the real world to create instruments of life and death.      Pynchon's prose technique has an obvious forebear in William Gaddis's \\"The Recognitions,\\" an even more nebulous but less humorous book.  Like Gaddis, Pynchon constructs a paragraph around a central idea using exotic imagery that changes, often abruptly and incongruously, from sentence to sentence without losing the thematic focus.  This approach grants the novel an extraordinary lexicon, as though Pynchon were inspired by every little nut and bolt of daily living, just as \\"Ulysses\\" benefits from James Joyce's polyglot interests.  Any long paragraph you pick out is practically a self-contained tableau of fresh (and occasionally gross) sights and sounds contributing to the panorama of Slothrop's odyssey.    Some may find the blunt mathematical insertions, the endless wordplay, and the juvenile humor to be overwhelming and sophomoric, but in an age of literature where anything goes, they are salient and intelligent enough to be appreciated by a reader with a healthy curiosity for the unfamiliar or the unusual.  Personally, I enjoyed the technical allusions in all their brazen disregard for subtlety simply because they're so rarely, if ever, seen in literature.  If you question the significance of \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" consider it a postmodernist update of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" with the hookah-smoking caterpillar replaced by the seedier drug culture of the early 1970s, the rocket expanded into a metaphor of the impact of military technology on almost every cultural aspect of the twentieth century, Pynchon boldly guiding the foolhardy few who are willing to follow him into uncharted territory, having fun with everything along the way.	2004-12-31

Like all of Eliot's major novels, it is a masterpiece of form, developing from a pastoral about childhood into a brooding love story concerning five young people who are motivated by a complex web of emotions involving pity, loyalty, and spite.<br /><br />The two protagonists are Maggie Tulliver and her older brother Tom, whose father owns Dorlcote Mill on the river Floss near a town called St. Ogg's.  Maggie, Eliot's presumable alter ego, is a normal little girl in most respects but extremely bright and quite mischievous, cutting off her hair to rebel against her remonstrative mother and nattering aunts and uncles and pushing her pretty cousin Lucy Deane into a puddle of mud in a fit of jealousy.  Tom, on the other hand, is a pragmatist rather than a Fury; he lives strictly according to the principles set forth by their father and believes people should be held accountable for their actions.  While Maggie enriches her mind through her own reading, her father, who believes girls have no need for education, sends the much less bookish Tom to a prosaic tutor named Stelling to fathom the mysteries of Virgil and Euclid.<br /><br />While visiting Tom at Stelling's, Maggie meets the only other person in the novel whose intellect matches her own--Philip Wakem, a sensitively artistic but deformed boy whose father, a lawyer, is the sworn enemy of Mr. Tulliver.  Philip, painfully aware of his unattractiveness, falls in love with Maggie because she is the only girl who has ever shown any interest in him; but Tom, loyal to his father and mindful of the harm Mr. Wakem has done to their family, warns her not to socialize with him.  The trysts of Philip and Maggie--the hunchback and the tall, gawky girl--may seem like a grotesque parody of Romeo and Juliet, but there is touching sincerity and truthfulness in their scenes together.<br /><br />Years pass, and a new man enters the story--Stephen Guest, the handsome heir to a shipping business which is co-owned by Maggie's uncle Deane (Lucy's father) and employs Tom, who is trying to make enough money to buy back Dorlcote Mill, swindled away by Mr. Wakem.  Stephen is ostensibly Lucy's boyfriend, but he soon becomes attracted to Maggie, who has turned into a graceful young lady.  He also happens to be Philip's friend, and this can lead to nothing good.  Maggie is thrust into a gnawing dilemma--she loves Stephen but feels too much pity for Philip to abandon him; her love for Stephen is consumed by guilt.  And on top of this, Stephen reveals himself to be remorselessly selfish, concerned only for his own happiness.<br /><br />The ending, it must be said, is tragic, but not in the classical sense of being a consequence of the characters' flaws.  It is more dramatic than it needed to be, but it may just be Eliot's expression of the eternal unity she felt with her brother, a fate not to be shared by any traditional romantic partner, and the novel could hardly have concluded with greater force and pathos.  I praise many writers for a variety of skills, but Eliot stands high above the rest in her creation of these literary worlds of such extraordinary fineness and delicacy and in her exalted level of communication.  In my opinion, the art of the novel has no greater practitioner.hback and the tall, gawky girl--may seem like a grotesque parody of Romeo and Juliet, but there is touching sincerity and truthfulness in their scenes together.<br /><br />Years pass, and a new man enters the story--Stephen Guest, the handsome heir to a shipping business which is co-owned by Maggie's uncle Deane (Lucy's father) and employs Tom, who is trying to make enough money to buy back Dorlcote Mill, swindled away by Mr. Wakem.

Farrell takes on the task of writing about a redefining moment in the history of the British Empire in India.  In 1857, sepoys--Indian soldiers serving the British--conducted a mass rebellion against their superiors and the colonists in a violent effort to restore the Moghul emperor to power.  After the rebels besieged cities across the northern areas of the country, including Lucknow (renamed Krishnapur in the novel), they were quelled by the resistance of the British and allied Sikhs, who did not wish to return to Moghul rule.  The event prompted Queen Victoria to dissolve the British East India Company which had controlled the commercial and administrative policies of the country and establish India as a formal part of the British Empire.   <br /> <br />Farrell places the action of the novel in a British cantonment outside Krishnapur which comprises a community of bungalows, larger buildings, and a Residency.  The cantonment is overseen by an officer named Mr. Hopkins, the Collector, a title which serves double duty because he is fond of collecting various curios with which he decorates the Residency.  As news of sepoy insurgencies reaches the cantonment, Hopkins worries that the unrest might overtake Krishnapur and rallies the troops for protection.  Chief among these is Lieutenant Harry Dunstaple, whose sister Louise and father, a civil surgeon, also live in the cantonment.  However, the true hero is a mild-mannered, timorous young writer named George Fleury, assigned by the East India Company to report on the advances in civilization made by the Indians under British rule, who by the end of the story will be transformed by unexpected courage.   <br /> <br />When the sepoys slowly but surely advance upon the cantonment, the siege becomes a reality and lasts practically throughout the summer, during which the colonists must contend with cramped quarters, dwindling supplies of food and ammunition, the threat of disease, and monstrous swarms of black flies, all while trying to avoid being killed by enemy fire and flying debris.  Like novice campers who aren't used to \\"roughing it,\\" they have made awkward attempts at preserving a British standard of comfort in this foreign culture and climate, but the physical demands of the siege finally force them into a savage state.   <br /> <br />Farrell pays considerate attention to his minor characters, remembering that there are many kinds of lives in the balance.  Fleury's sister Miriam, who has accompanied her brother to the cantonment, proves to be a valuable medical aid; the physician Dr. McNab argues with his rival Dr. Dunstaple about the proper treatment of cholera; the resident minister, called only the Padre, is convinced that the insurrection is a heavenly judgment against the colonists for their sins; a dishonored, suicidal woman named Lucy Hughes, finds redemption; and Hari, the English-educated, gadget-minded son of the Maharajah of Krishnapur, who has befriended the colonists, takes shelter in the cantonment during the siege. <br /> <br />For a novel written in 1973, the style of \\"The Siege of Krishnapur\\" is unabashedly traditional; making no pretense of any type of modernism, it simply tells its story in colorful detail and muscular prose, recalling the tense narrative spirit of Kipling and Conrad.  Although it is based on a historical event, it is much more about its characters and how they are affected by the siege than it is about the historical forces that drive the event.  What Farrell has achieved here is a very neatly structured and satisfying fictional picture of British colonial life in India during an extraordinary time of turmoil.   <br /> <br />	2004-12-12

He is an elderly vintner living with his wife and daughter Eugenie, his only child, in a provincial French town called Saumur, and even they don't know exactly how much money he has.  He is so stingy he has let his house fall into decrepitude and doles out basic necessities like sugar, candles, and firewood as though there were a shortage.  He is so sinfully avaricious that even on his deathbed he can only lust for the priest's silver crucifix.  He is devious, too--he has a disarmingly strange business manner in which he feigns stammering and deafness to derail his opponent's train of thought.  He is, in short, one of the best characters a reader could hope for.   <br /> <br />Given the power of Grandet's presence and the extremity of his greed, a reader might expect him to be due for a fall, but Balzac is more interested in demonstrating how Eugenie becomes a noble woman despite, or perhaps because of, her parental influence.  The story concerns the fortune of her spoiled but innocent cousin Charles, the son of Grandet's younger brother in Paris, and how she deals with his change in personality after he goes abroad to seek employment after his father's debt-induced suicide and returns having engaged in the cruel enterprise of slave trading.  (I was reminded of Ibsen's Peer Gynt, who is hardened by the competitiveness of world commerce into rationalizing his immoral business pursuits.)  He forsakes his love for Eugenie by arranging a marriage of convenience to another girl to increase his social status, revealing himself to be as cold and calculating as his uncle, but Eugenie triumphs in the end through her magnanimity.   <br /> <br />This is the third Balzac novel I've read, and the third I'd label a masterpiece.  Here we have a fascinating study of the interplay between four very strong characters--Old Grandet, his sheltered and naive but soon-to-be-wise daughter, his libertine nephew, and his trusted female servant Nanon, who appears to have the most goodness and common sense of anybody in the story--woven into an elegant tale that has the simplicity and moral lucidity of a fable with the substance of a Shakespearean drama, the work of a playwright at heart who prefers to write in prose.  Whether or not it was his intention, Balzac convinces us, with delicious satire instead of tedious didacticism, that there are lessons to be learned from the examples set by flawed as well as virtuous people.     <br /> <br />	2004-12-01

This is the situation of Claude Lantier, Zola's protagonist, a demon of the palette who is so obsessed with the perfection of his art that his wife, who has chosen to suffer poverty with him, laments that she is only his mistress, that he is truly married to the painted women on his canvases. <br /> <br />Claude's temperamental, dour personality is based loosely on that of Zola's own friend Paul Cezanne, a pioneering postimpressionist who achieved a level of fame and respect nobody in Zola's time could have foreseen, one which Claude is not destined to attain.  Indeed, his efforts to forge a new style of painting conflicts with the conventional sensibilities of bourgeois Paris and the eponymous Salon, apparently the sole arbiters of the city's artistic taste.  He is increasingly frustrated, but ever more determined, by the ridicule directed by the public at large towards his harshly rendered paintings, displayed in the rejects' gallery.  \\"We are the future!...the day will come when we'll kill their Salon stone dead,\\" Claude vows to his circle of sympathetic friends. <br /> <br />Friends are what Claude needs.  His two boyhood chums--Pierre Sandoz, a novelist supposed to represent Zola himself, and Louis Dubuche, an architecture student--become financially successful in very different ways (Sandoz by writing a popular series of Zola-esque novels about members of a Parisian family in various strata of society, Dubuche by marrying a sickly heiress), while Claude labors obscurely in an austere apartment, living on a meager stipend from a generous benefactor and making a little extra cash by selling some of his less objectionable paintings to a dealer.  He has another friend who is his antithesis of a sort, a traditional painter of genteel portraits named Fagerolles, who wins the money and even the critical acclaim that Claude seeks.  <br /> <br />One of the novel's major elements is the intense and beautifully imagined love affair between Claude and a girl named Christine whom he meets on the street one rainy night.  Initially his radical art horrifies her, but she easily accustoms herself to it, even modeling for him.  Their cohabitation produces a son they name Jacques, whose deformity and retardation seem grotesque implications of their neglect of him.  It is not revealing too much to say that Jacques dies at twelve, for it is indicative of Claude's peculiarly callous state of mind that the sight of the dead boy inspires him to complete another canvas--the most attention he has paid to his son in years.        <br /> <br />Zola is not the best of the great French novelists of the nineteenth century, but he is arguably the easiest to read and understand; and he is certainly original, having made a conscientious effort to set his style apart from that of his forebears Hugo and Balzac and providing the foundation for the new realism of the twentieth century as practiced by Americans like Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser.  Zola's style, and that of his proteges, is characterized by what seems to be a necessary irony--that a writer who was so successful could be so morbidly fascinated with failure.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-29

How much of the account is fact rather than fiction is difficult to deduce from the tone of Melville's presentation, but the question of veracity doesn't diminish the entertainment value, because \\"Typee\\" is a colorfully detailed adventure yarn that reads like National Geographic crossed with Boys' Life.   <br /> <br />Melville is serving as a sailor on a whaling ship called the Dolly which is cruising the South Pacific and lands on the island of Nukuheva in the Marquesas, among the easternmost of the archipelagoes in the vast group known collectively as Polynesia.  Deserting the ship because of the captain's tyranny, he and another like-minded crew member, named Toby, plunge into the mountainous wilderness of Nukuheva with the plan of later obtaining passage on another ship leaving the island, which has heavy French marine traffic.  They enter an isolated valley inhabited by a tribe called the Typees, who invite them to live in their community.  Melville and Toby accept the invitation because they have nowhere else to go for the time being, and the Typees seem friendly despite their reputation as cannibals.   <br /> <br />The Typees treat Melville (who has told them his name is Tom) extremely well, but they refuse to release him from captivity; Toby meanwhile has gone off to the harbors for medical relief but never returns, leaving Melville to describe the customs and activities of the Typees.  Their religion is festive, but they have a strange relationship with their gods, whom they berate by abusing their idols.  Their language, which has a tendency to double words, is quite comical to English-trained ears, as for example in their designation of the French merchants as \\"wee-wees.\\"  The girls and the scenery are fantastically beautiful, but there are also dangers, such as the Happars, the rival tribe who occasionally wage war against the relatively placid Typees.  Of special note is a young warrior named Kory-Kory whose brotherly affection for Melville could very well have inspired the character of Queequeg in \\"Moby-Dick.\\"   <br /> <br />The implications of the story are fairly simple, if overromanticized: Civilized man confronts the noble savage, discovers they are skilled artisans and healers and primarily peaceful fruit-eaters who eat human flesh only when it is that of their vanquished enemies; and, upon astonished reflection, realizes the corruption and the hypocritical facades of his own technologically advanced society.  What would now be called political correctness was in the 1840s merely a perspective by an observant world traveler with no ideological agenda to push.  But, although the valley of the Typees may be a paradise, it's not Melville's paradise, which is why he endeavors to escape his gracious hosts.  It's a good thing he eventually did, because he had better books waiting to be written. <br />  <br />	2004-11-23

Chesterton is a humorous writer, and he writes sterling prose; these two enviable qualities distinguish him as superior to Arthur Conan Doyle as a mystery writer, not to mention superior to most writers in any genre.  This Penguin omnibus of nearly fifty stories featuring his clerical sleuth Father Brown is an excellent introduction to the man's classic English style of understated wit, taste for the exotic and the mythical, unbounded imagination, and worldly philosophy, helpfully reduced to easily digestible epigrams by the discursive priest.  Chesterton doesn't cloister his protagonist in a strictly ecclesiastical environment; Father Brown's social realm lies far outside the church and well within the material world of theatrically colorful disguises, melodramatic villains and their not entirely innocent victims, big business, and fabulous wealth. <br /> <br />If Chesterton has anything in common with Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, it is the way he incorporates his strong religious convictions into his fiction.  Two of the Commandments--the ones forbidding stealing and killing--are the most typically transgressed in these stories, the committers of these sins betrayed by moral weakness detected by Father Brown, a scholar of motives and the human tendency to do wrong in the absence of a solid spiritual anchor.  Like Sherlock Holmes, he solves crimes by noticing small details that everybody else misses and applying the most rigid logic, but he is more human and animated than the stolid Holmes.  He even has a professional cohort, a French private detective who goes by the name of Flambeau and who bedeviled the world as a master thief before the solicitous Father Brown showed him the error of his wicked ways.     <br /> <br />Aside from his short, stout stature, mildly clumsy behavior, and the benevolent patience with which he tolerates atheists, socialists, skeptics, mystics, pagans, etc., Father Brown's greatest distinction as a character is his representation of thesupreme logic and rationale Chesterton considers inherent in Roman Catholic theology; he is less a visual figure than an embodiment of a set of ideas, a projection of his author's conscience and intellect, clothed in black.  Although Chesterton undoubtedly hopes to enlighten the heathens among his readers, he doesn't insult their intelligence with simplistic morality tales; he knows that we don't need Father Brown to remind us, however eloquently, that stealing and killing are wrong.  Chesterton rather uses the conflict between good and evil as the context within which he can expound his philosophical opinions through a priestly voice.  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />	2004-11-22

To be fair, it was probably no less sanitary than most other large cities of the world at the time, but Dickens takes peculiarly great interest in bringing the dirt to the surface in meticulous detail, as though he wanted to chronicle this information for a more health-conscious future age.  The central feature in \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" is the Thames River, a watery morgue filled with floating corpses, and whose wharfs and docks are a dank repository for a variety of shady misfits.  It is here, in the novel's opening scene, that the boatman Gaffer Hexam and his daughter Lizzie, who regularly scavenge the river for treasure-laden corpses, pull a body out of the river which turns out to be the remains of one John Harmon, heir to a wondrous fortune.<br /><br />Harmon's death is obviously a case of foul play, but Dickens is less interested in rendering it a mystery than he is in spinning it into a web of character interaction in a grandiose study of cause and effect.  Like that of a spider, the web is intricate and delicate: A man named Nicodemus Boffin, who inherits the money bequeathed to Harmon, may be suspected of the murder but appears innocent enough, especially in his and his wife's philanthropic nature manifested in their adoption of an orphan named Sloppy and their invitation to a girl named Bella Wilfer to live with them.  Bella, whose father is a meek clerk for a member of Parliament named Veneering, and whose suitor was none other than the deceased John Harmon, receives the romantic attention of a young man named John Rokesmith (the titular \\"mutual friend\\"), who ingratiates his way into Boffin's employ as a secretary and is harboring a dark, crucial secret about his identity.  The romance of Rokesmith and Bella--who, to complicate affairs, admits she only wants to marry a rich man, not a pauper like Rokesmith--is contrasted with the fierce rivalry of the snobbish lawyer Eugene Wrayburn and the jealous schoolmaster Bradley Headstone for the heart of Lizzie Hexam, whose brother Charley is Bradley's pupil.<br /><br />Enough?

The girl was not a good student--Oates had flunked her, and it's easy to see why if her epistolary manner indicates the quality of her literary essays.  But the passion and the pain in her letters cry out for a story to be told, one that is probably more interesting than any that could have been furnished by a better, happier pupil.   <br /> <br />The girl is given the pseudonym of Maureen Wendall, and \\"Them\\" is the saga of her dysfunctional lower-class family from 1937 to about 1966.  A laundry list of domestic turmoil--rape, murder, attempted murder, assault, accidental death--devastates the Wendalls as they migrate throughout the poor neighborhoods of Detroit, chasing solvency and dignity in vain.  Her older brother Jules, a restless, rebellious spirit, can't stay away from bad influences or out of trouble, and her younger sister Betty is a mischievous tomboy whose delinquency seems to arise from familial neglect--they only take notice of her when she's doing something wrong, which of course is most of the time.  <br /> <br />Maureen herself is bright enough and behaves well; she likes to read and makes the public library her sanctuary, where in the permanence of the words of Jane Austen novels she finds a comforting reality lacking in the instability of her home life.  Her innocence is destined to falter, however; as a teenager, she begins meeting an older man and accepts money for having sex with him.  When her ogreish stepfather suspects her of misdeeds, he beats her severely, incapacitating her to a bedridden, emotionally withdrawn state for about a year.   <br /> <br />Jules, in the meantime, has quit school and begun living the life of a job-hopping, potentially dangerous drifter, part Frank Chambers, part Studs Lonigan, and (to be kind) a little part Tom Joad.  He is hired as a chauffeur by a blundering rich (or once-rich) man named Bernard and through him meets his pretty niece, Nadine, a girl residing in an affluent suburb representing a world he has never before been able to attain.  She runs away with him, and what happens to them on their cross-country journey and then afterward is too sad to be comical and yet too absurd to be tragic in the classical sense; too gross for the conventions of fiction, it could be expected to happen only in real life.  <br /> <br />Oates culminates this novel filled with various kinds of violence in a race riot, against the backdrop of which the ideological diatribes uttered by several characters newly introduced to the story, advocating large-scale social changes for the nation, seem oddly removed from the more private concerns of the Wendall family.  But, after all, the Wendalls' privacy is impacted and influenced by the public force of human presence, the people we don't necessarily know: \\"them.\\"  Much of the novel is uncomfortable to read, not so much with regard to the physical violence as when the characters use abusive language to hurt each other, but it resonates with a power and realism rarely seen in fiction.   <br />	2004-11-09

(To say James is a master of understatement is an understatement.)  Rather, the novel appears to use the movement as a device to weave male-female relationships into a Balzacian comedy of society.  Compared to most of his more popular novels, it is quite lighthearted. <br /> <br />The central heroine is the voluptuous Verena Tarrant, an inspirational public speaker with the voice of an angel and the charm of a Homeric siren.  Her uniquely sheltered upbringing as the daughter of a fraudulent and avaricious \\"mesmeric healer\\" has freed her from a normal education and exposed her to anybody who wants to take advantage of her ingenuousness.  One night at the home of an elderly progressive activist named Miss Birdseye, she delivers a mellifluous speech that grabs the attention of the scheming feminist Olive Chancellor and her cousin Basil Ransom, a Mississippi lawyer who has settled in New York to begin a practice and has just come to Boston to visit his relatives.    <br /> <br />Olive quickly befriends Verena with the intention of putting her oratorical skills to work for the women's movement, acting as her mentor and coaching her in the rationale for gender equality.  Men, including her own father, see Verena as a goldmine: A wealthy Harvard student named Henry Burrage offers to be her lecture agent, and a journalist named Matthias Pardon reports on her professional engagements, helping her to become a celebrity who commands large audiences.  Basil, a conservative gentleman, naturally thinks Verena's speeches are radical nonsense; he resents the \\"feminization\\" of male society that he fears the emancipation of women would effect.  Like Burrage, he would like to marry her, but he would first like to get the silly ideas out of her head placed there by Olive.  Furthermore, his attraction to Verena is disheartening to Olive's widowed sister Adeline Luna, who is somewhat infatuated with him and sympathetic to his traditionalist views. <br /> <br />It almost goes without saying that the novel is not about the political aspect of women's rights; James is obviously not interested in that.  The conflict he establishes is the selfish battle for control over Verena--whether her career in the hands of Olive and her handlers will submit to Basil's love for her.  In general I find James's prose style to be too purposefully obstructive and uninviting, but here I was able to put aside my reservations and concentrate on the story at hand because I sensed the end would be rewarding, and indeed I liked the way the last sentence of the novel forgoes convention and leaves the principal question of Verena's happiness open and unresolved.  For what it's worth, James also conjures great descriptions of street scenes of Boston and New York, giving genuine verbal snapshots of what these cities must have looked like at the time.  He will never be one of my favorite writers, but I concede that he is one of my favorite disagreeable writers. <br />	2004-10-26

The first is an evening party at the mansion of the Prince and Princess de Guermantes attended by Proust's young narrator despite his doubt about having been properly invited, and the second is a dinner at the seaside clifftop house of the Verdurins filled with absurd but fascinating conversation.  These episodes combined cover hundreds of pages of narration yet never give the impression of being stretched because Proust evokes the natural importance in every detail and human gesture, as though the course of the world depended on every little thing that transpires.  <br /> <br />These details unify under the banner of the entire novel into a series of fictionalized memories of Proust's social life as a young man making his way through Parisian aristocratic circles and observing the events which develop his artistic conscience.  These memories tend to be romanticized visions of the past, wistful dreams of what he might have really wanted his life to be: \\"We dream much of paradise, or rather of a number of successive paradises, but each of them is, long before we die, a paradise lost, in which we should feel ourselves lost too.\\"   <br /> <br />The title of the volume implies love between men and women, and men and men, and women and women.  Here, the young Marcel chronicles the torrid romances of the Baron de Charlus, brother of the Duke de Guermantes, whose salon was the focal arena of the previous volume.  Upon his spying--innocently, not judgmentally--on de Charlus and Jupien the tailor in an act of sodomy, he expounds on the societal attitudes confronting male homosexuality and on the ways de Charlus must go about procuring younger men for himself, such as he does with a conceited young violinist named Morel.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Marcel's love affair with Albertine,the pretty girl whom he met at the seaside resort of Balbec in Volume II, is progressing slowly but not smoothly.  He notices that she, as Odette used to do with Charles Swann, is beginning to play games with his propensity for jealousy, flirting first with a girl named Andree and then with Marcel's friend, the soldier Saint-Loup.  As the volume wraps up, Marcel resolves to marry her, hoping to draw her away from her Sapphic inclinations. <br /> <br />Proust portrays a wide range of colorful supporting characters, who I have no doubt are based on people he knew in real life.  While staying at Balbec, Marcel meets an eccentric family named Cambremer whom the lift-boy at the hotel mistakenly but amusingly calls Camembert and whose acquaintance provides a springboard for the dinner at the Verdurin estate.  Here we experience the personalities of the physician Cottard, whose preoccupation with his Verdurin invitations affects his professional ethics; the shy, socially graceless Saniette, who is continuously bullied by Verdurin; and a pedantic bore named Brichot, who talks almost exclusively about the etymology of place names.   <br /> <br />The motifs recurring in this volume include the society-enveloping controversy over the Dreyfus affair, the snobbery involved in invitations to certain salons, and Marcel's association with the aging and ill Swann and his wife Odette, who now have some hard-earned esteem in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.  In his deeply contemplative approach to narration, Proust functions as an essayist as much as he does a novelist, but his genius is that he merges both forms seamlessly.  His sentences, at least as translated into English by Moncrieff and Kilmartin, are consistently worthy of applause and inspire me to write with more sensitivity to my surroundings.  <br />      <br /> <br />	2004-10-22
US	49396726	R25YU5XOX9A0C7	0679736514	616884127	Intruder in the Dust	Books	4	20	22	N	N	Southern mystery, Faulkner style	After twenty years of writing experimental fiction and Hollywood screenplays, Faulkner seemed destined to create a novel like \\"Intruder in the Dust\\"--a noir-ish mystery set in Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, that incorporates his signature prose style into a continuing commentary on race relations in the South.  The premise of the accusation of a black man for the murder of a white man may seem too facile, but the novel does not rely solely or even primarily on plot-driven intrigue; it is the criminal aspect only as it relates to the prevalent social attitudes that generates interest.     One day a local white man named Vinson Gowrie is found shot to death, and a black man named Lucas Beauchamp is arrested at the scene and charged with the murder.  In this part of the country at this time in history, a black man who is even suspected of murdering a white man is in danger of being lynched, especially by people like Gowrie's relatives, who are from a particularly rough and bloodthirsty enclave living in an area called Beat Four.      The story is told in the third person but from the viewpoint of a white boy named Charles \\"Chick\\" Mallison, who in the past has tried to befriend the solitary but kind Beauchamp and is convinced of his innocence.  With the help of his uncle Gavin Stevens, a lawyer who decides to represent Beauchamp, his black friend Aleck Sander, and an elderly spinster named Miss Habersham, Chick investigates the matter and discovers, unsurprisingly, that there is more to the case than initially meets the eye.      This sounds like generic pulp detective stuff, and indeed there is not much to say about the plot except that it involves a lumber scam, quicksand, a false grave, and a real culprit who is not too bright; but what makes this novel worth reading is the insight it gives about how easily in this milieu a black man can conveniently take the heat for a white man's crime, regardless of provability of guilt, and the ethical implications that arisefrom this situation.  There is a particular manner in which the characters communicate with each other that reveals this information, conveying Faulkner's sublime sense of the range of personal moralities.     Faulkner has several narrative modes at his disposal, and the one he chooses here is similar to that of \\"Absalom! Absalom!\\", employing impossibly long and syntactically deformed run-on sentences that compress copious visual detail into quickly moving scenic impressions.  This technique could annoy many, but for those who know how to \\"read\\" Faulkner, it may be accepted as a characteristic part of the package.  I'd place \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" somewhat below \\"Sanctuary\\" as an aesthetic achievement, but I still commend it as satisfying, like that tasty last bit of dessert after a full meal.	2004-10-15

Lawrence's most famous novel, which is a shame because compared to his earlier masterpieces \\"Sons and Lovers,\\" \\"The Rainbow,\\" and \\"Women in Love\\" it's really not very good.  It achieved its fame as one of the most censored novels in history, and the legal battles for its completely unexpurgated publication continued for decades after Lawrence's death in 1930.  As far as I can tell, the censorship was caused not so much by the subject--the extramarital affairs of a woman trapped in a celibate marriage--but by the explicitly erotic scenes of sexual intercourse and especially the language, which were very daring for the time.   <br /> <br />Lawrence sets the stage portentously on the very first page by introducing Lady Connie Chatterley's husband, the baronet Sir Clifford, as having been wounded serving in World War I, paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.  With this limiting premise, in what direction could the story go other than Connie's quest to fulfill her need for a sexual relationship?  She turns her romantic attention first to an unromantic Irish playwright named Michaelis and then to Clifford's gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors, who is separated from a jealous, neurotic wife, while Lawrence describes the sexual encounters with considerable poetic panache.  Lawrence labors nobly to make these characters interesting, but they never seem like more than cardboard cutouts of the fuller figures he so richly developed in his three major novels.  They are simple people with simple thoughts and desires; their conversations are dreadfully boring.   <br /> <br />It is surprising for a novel of such risque reputation to contain almost no surprises, but there are a few notable moments, most of which unfortunately serve to illustrate Clifford's impotence in more areas than just sexual.  His wheelchair is motorized, and when one day while on a walk the motor fails and Connie and Mellors have to struggle to push him up a hill, Clifford fumes at his helplessness, his mobility at the mercy of others.  This is a long, agonizing scene which seems intended to make the reader uncomfortable by cruelly emphasizing the disparity in power between the two men in Connie's life, the wealthy paraplegic and the poor but ambulatory stud.  Could Lawrence have been less subtle?  Did he feel, two thirds of the way into the novel, that his point had not yet been made clearly?  <br /> <br />The narrative also suffers from some carelessly bad prose characterized by awkwardly worded metaphors (\\"The fine flower of their intimacy was to her rather like an orchid, a bulb stuck parasitic on her tree of life, and producing, to her eyes, a rather shabby flower.\\") and extraneous misoneism about the urbanization of post-World War I England caused by increasing industrialization; but I could overlook these flaws if the story had given me something more than a prurient attempt to lament the disintegration of the significance of modern marriage.  What I got was a D.H. Lawrence who was not firing on all cylinders.  The man wrote some great novels, but \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" is not one of them. <br />	2004-10-10

From Bromden we get a clear picture of the clinical division of the patients--Acutes who are \\"still sick enough to be fixed\\" and Chronics who are \\"in for good\\"--and of the methods used to care for them and keep them in line, which include occasional electro-shock therapy and lobotomies. <br /> <br />The ward is in the hands of Nurse Ratched, a strict disciplinarian just short of a tyrant.  We learn very little about her background, but it is obvious she has much experience as a psychiatric nurse because she is masterful in the way she browbeats and controls her patients (all of them male) through psychological methods like imposition of guilt and deprivation of privileges, while the orderlies act as a sadistic sort of police force.  The only other figure of authority is a meek male doctor named Spivey, who is decent enough to fraternize, if not sympathize, with the patients. <br /> <br />One day a new patient enters the ward--a petty criminal named Randle Patrick McMurphy who is apparently sane but is feigning insanity to get out of incarceration at a work farm.  Jocose and gregarious, he warmly introduces himself to everybody in the ward and encourages them to have more fun, which to him means card gambling and taking the guys out on a fishing trip.  Of course, his measures conflict with Nurse Ratched's rules and result in what is essentially a struggle for power; she tries to diminish his influence on the other patients by hinting to them that he's really only taking advantage of their gullibility and making money off of them. <br /> <br />One criticism I have is that the main characters are not as fully developed as they could be; Bromden, the Nurse, and even McMurphy seem somewhat thin for the considerably demanding requirements of their roles.  More appealing to me were two other patients--the sententious Harding, who has a knockout for a wife and observes the folly of the ward with a cheerfully ironic sense of humor; and Billy Bibbit, a bashful, suicidal stutterer with an overprotective mother.  I would have preferred Harding over Bromden as the narrator, but of course that would have necessitated changing the tone of the entire novel. <br /> <br />\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is often said to be allegorical in its depiction of the rebel versus the establishment, but that aspect of it doesn't really interest me because Kesey doesn't even try to be subtle about it; no, I think the novel's value is in the sheer momentum of its narrative, which burns like the fuse on a stick of dynamite.  Even for those who have never seen Milos Forman's fantastic 1975 film version of the novel, the sense that the story is leading up to something big and explosive is palpable and pulsating. <br />	2004-10-03

Dying is a deterministic process in that there is an infinite number of ways it can be done, but the result is always the same.  The way Ivan Ilyich does it is slow and painful, but this is not by choice; indeed, he had never considered the way he would die or even that he would die at all, and when the burden is finally thrust upon him, he is unable to handle it.  In Jean-Paul Sartre's \\"Nausea,\\" written half a century later, the protagonist is horrified by the knowledge of his own inexplicably created existence; Ivan Ilyich is horrified to realize his existence is about to come to an inexplicable end.  <br /> <br />Ivan Ilyich is a middle-aged man who has played it safe throughout his life, following all the rules of society, studying law, becoming a judge, marrying a lady from a good family, raising his kids properly, and enjoying evenings of whist with his colleagues.  One day, while working in his apartment, he has an accident and injures his kidney, which though at first seeming trivial, soon cripples him with pain and confines him to bed.  He notices with bitter irony that the doctors who treat him (to no avail) play God with his fate similarly to the way he has played God with the fates of men on trial.   <br /> <br />His affection for his family cools as his thoughts become obsessed with death.  His wife, who has always been little more than an accessory to his public image, and daughter consider the physical demands of his terminal illness more an inconvenience to their lifestyle, a clamp on their freedom, than a cause for lamentation; his friends find the social obligations of dealing with funerals and condolence calls tedious.  His only comfort, small as it is, is his loyal servant Gerasim, who nurses him compassionately until the very end.   <br /> <br />Ivan Ilyich's scream of despair is the swansong of a man who can't believe the life he has cultivated so lovingly is so soon going to end on a sudden whim.  As one who was born dying, he failed to heed Marcus Aurelius's words to disdain the flesh, and now flesh is all he can treasure.  Tolstoy could have written this story as a spritual or metaphysical meditation on death, but instead it is simply a brilliant dirge for a man embarking on a journey--the one we all have to make--into the final unknown. <br />	2004-09-29
US	49396726	R3GCNEB2ZHZRGM	0060937939	894115662	Little, Big	Books	5	32	34	N	N	Size matters	John Crowley's \\"Little, Big\\" is a particularly challenging work of fantasy to read and describe because it is not so much a story as it is about storytelling.  Although written by an American in 1981, it often looks like a novel that came from an Englishman in 1881, immersed as it is in a Victorian mode, as though Lewis Carroll had lived into the automotive age and decided to incorporate elements from \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" into an epic of magic and madness.    <br /> <br />Shakespeare's play is clearly an inspiration, as the essence of \\"Little, Big\\" is founded on fairies, pixies, brownies, sprites, sylphs, dryads--i.e., mythological personifications of nature--although most of the characters are (apparently) human.  The genesis of the story (or the Tale, as it is referred to throughout the novel) is the marriage of Smoky Barnable, an average, unassuming young man from the mundane world, to a fantastically beautiful and tall girl named Daily Alice Drinkwater, whose family is somehow (or should I say Somehow) connected to the supernatural.  The Drinkwaters live in a large, bizarrely constructed house called Edgewood which, not unlike a smaller version of Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast, is a gothic manor of labyrinthine and spatially illogical architecture surrounded by a demesne of ornate gardens and wooded landscapes and seems almost to exist in an alternate realm of its own, separated from the real world.   <br /> <br />The novel does acknowledge the \\"real\\" world, but only obliquely, like a surrealistic painting.  Smoky and Daily Alice's son Auberon, perplexed by the secrets of the Drinkwater dynasty and desiring to make a living on his own as a writer, comes to the City (transparently New York) to live with his cousin George Mouse, who actually has a farm.  It is here that Auberon will eventually meet his Titania, and here also that a distant relation, an old woman mystic named Ariel Hawksquill, will contend with Russell Eigenblick, a tyrant with an ancient pastand a future that poses danger for the Tale. <br /> <br />If none of this sounds like the constitution of a cohesive novel, be aware that \\"Little, Big\\" has little interest in the conventions of literary genre and instead seeks to achieve a phantasmagorical effect.  To this end, Crowley weaves an intricate tapestry of concepts from history, mythology, and his own imagination, employing tarot cards, talking animals, the Holy Roman Empire, a contraption called the Cosmo-Opticon, an orrery (keep a dictionary handy) powered by a perpetual-motion machine, while Auberon's three sisters spin, measure, and cut thread like the Fates.  This is heavy, complex, philosophical material to be read with patience and an open mind, not for the common fantasy reader who is hoping for an easy, banal plot.  <br /> <br />Crowley's rich, colorful prose pays lavish attention to detail, contrasting the tranquil idyll of Edgewood with the faceless modernity of the City, but even more notably it maintains the narrative in a certain nebulous state, as though the characters were passing in and out of each other's dreams.  Everywhere is the thrill that something to be revealed is barely out of reach, and little by little the pieces come together like a finely cut jigsaw puzzle.  This book is a marvel; a massively enjoyable journey into the myriad possibilities of post-Victorian fantasy.     <br /> <br />	2004-09-14
US	49396726	R38AOPLGA0LBEV	0553214225	872664967	Summer (Bantam Classics)	Books	5	48	51	N	N	A book for all seasons	Edith Wharton did the impossible with \\"Summer\\" and wrote a love story I actually cared about.  Not because her protagonists are likeable, but because their character flaws render them believable and intriguing and fill the reader with sensational expectations; they are not just mannequins waiting to be posed within the frame of a formulaic plot.  A novel published in 1917 that depicts an abortionist withholding a piece of jewelry from a woman until she pays her fee is obviously not something that was shaped by the cookie cutter.   <br /> <br />Wharton sets the story in an isolated village called North Dormer, evidently in the Berkshires of western Massachussetts.  The heroine, a young woman named Charity Royall, is bored with her life there as the sole librarian of the village's shoddy, neglected library when one day she meets Lucius Harney, an urbane young architect who has come to North Dormer to visit a relative and to sketch colonial houses.  Their initial friendship blossoms into a romance which is threatened by two factors: Charity's guardian, the local lawyer Mr. Royall, a stingy, miserable man who drinks too much, desires to marry her; and Charity, an orphan raised by Mr. Royall and his deceased wife, is embarrassed by her heritage as a child born among the shunned, destitute farmers who live up on the \\"Mountain,\\" as it is called. <br /> <br />Wharton, the model of what good American prose looked like in the early twentieth century, is more importantly a thematic innovator who seeks to reflect female identity, in this case personified by a rustic girl who attempts to break the constraints of her native element by pursuing an improbable romance with a man whose sophistication allows him to take advantage of her simplicity, only to turn to another man whose position allows him to take advantage of the situation in which the first man placed her.  One detects an echo of Wharton's own unhappy marriage in the story, and indeed the decision Charity makes at the end seems to spring from desperate resignation, the defeated sense of being trapped, rather than from true love.  For Wharton, the way out was through the power and elegance of the written word, but Charity, oblivious to the wonder of the books she has so long tended but ignored, has no such option.   <br /> <br />	2004-09-08

This is the case with \\"The Razor's Edge,\\" which basically pertains to several fictionalized people with whom he hobnobbed while traveling around America and Europe between the World Wars and is narrated by the author himself in a relaxed, plainspoken voice. <br /> <br />Maugham introduces us to a circle of friends and acquaintances, most of whom are American, from various walks of life and levels of affluence.  At the center is a wealthy Chicagoan named Elliott Templeton--Maugham calls him a snob because he holds fashionable dinners attended only by the social elite and excludes those outside his class, but in actuality he is very generous and considerate, a devoted convert to Catholicism, a man of whose life the moral could be the ultimate emptiness of glamor, as illustrated by his lonely death.  Elliott's \\"sparkling and vivacious\\" niece Isabel is the feminine embodiment of the novel, an awkward girl who emerges as a graceful woman.  <br /> <br />Through Elliott we meet Isabel's boyfriend Larry, an affable, sensitive young man who represents the kind of protagonist with whom Maugham seems to identify the most--the restless soul, the open mind, the seeker of wisdom.  Having served as an aviator in the air corps during World War I and witnessed a friend die in valor, he is now idle and in no hurry to figure out what he wants to do with his life.  To Isabel's chagrin, he is not much interested in making a lot of money; he loves learning and would rather spend his time expanding his horizons, seeing the world and experiencing all it has to offer.   <br /> <br />While Larry is roaming the Orient finding himself, Isabel marries Gray, a very wealthy man until he is ruined in the New York stock market crash in 1929.  The self-knowledge Larry brings back from India and uses to revive Gray's spirits could be considered the crux of the novel, even though Maugham--ostensibly to tantalize the reader--tries to downplay its importance.  Larry also offers to marry the tragic Sophie, a wild American woman who has surrendered her life to alcohol, drugs, and promiscuity after her husband and child were killed in a car accident, but she refuses to be his \\"Mary Magdalen.\\" <br /> <br />Far from the taciturn, self-pitying semi-autobiographical Philip Carey of \\"Of Human Bondage,\\" the Maugham of \\"The Razor's Edge\\" is a confident and quietly amused cosmopolite who relishes his prestige as a famous author, a status that gives him a ticket to an echelon of society to which he knows he normally wouldn't be admitted.  He is fascinated by people and the stories they have to tell, relating them in breezy prose that obeys its aesthetic limits; and, suffusing the novel with the mood that America is slowly but surely supplanting England as the most militarily and financially powerful country in the world, gives a nod across the ocean to a readership that welcomed his books heartily. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-03

Starbuck, the lovably pathetic hero of Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Jailbird,\\" makes a potentially fascinating subject for a novel: son of immigrant servants of an eccentric wealthy man, Harvard graduate, ex-communist, well-meaning bureaucrat, squealer to the House Un-American Activities Committee, President Nixon's special advisor on youth affairs, and most recently a record company executive.  Oh, and for two years following his service with Nixon he was a distinguished guest of the federal prison system for his circumstantial involvement in the Watergate scandal. <br /> <br />The novel is constructed almost like an autobiography in which Starbuck looks back on the vicissitudes of his life with fatalistic humor.  The day that is clearest in his memory is the day he is released from his minimum-security incarceration and flies to New York to resume whatever remains of his life, and this day becomes quite momentous for him as he bumps into some old acquaintances who will change his fortunes possibly for the better. <br /> <br />Starbuck is a compassionate but unemotional observer of the consequences of war on both sides of the Atlantic.  His wife Ruth was a Holocaust survivor whom he had saved from poverty when he met her in Nuremberg just after World War II, and his job in Nixon's administration as a youth culture watchdog was a response to the notorious gunning down of four student protesters at Kent State.  Corporate encroachment on private enterprise is another theme, as Starbuck finds that the mysterious RAMJAC Corporation is acquiring everything from McDonald's to the New York Times. <br /> <br />\\"Jailbird\\" is not at all, as some might expect, a lampoon of Nixon's presidency, but a very general satire of the effects of governmental failure and mass corporatization on American society by the end of the transitional 1970s.  This is a comical portrait of a well-educated but wishy-washy man who wanted to be a civil servant because he \\"believed that there could be nohigher calling in a democracy than to a lifetime in government,\\" became a communist pitying the downtrodden workers symbolized by the martyred Sacco and Vanzetti, joined a Republican administration, and eventually moved up to big business.  Only in America, as they say. <br /> <br />Vonnegut's humor consists primarily of springing non sequiturs that shock by the nature of their contrast but whose significance becomes apparent later in the story; these can be very funny and clever at times, but after a while one longs for the subtlety of Evelyn Waugh or the erudition of Thomas Pynchon, both of which Vonnegut forgoes in his reckless attempts at meaningful absurdity.  Still, \\"Jailbird\\" lacks nothing for which Vonnegut is famous; but what it does lack could have made it more than just another Vonnegut novel. <br />	2004-08-21

Is Styron's novel the mature, scholarly work of a man who is genuinely fascinated with an ugly historical incident in his homeland (the Tidewater region of southeastern Virginia), or just an iconic relic of the Civil Rights era?  Styron would insist on the former, but posterity may judge it to be the latter.     Intentionally or not, the novel is certainly a magnet for controversy simply because so few facts are known about Nat Turner's life, which required Styron to fill in the blanks with as many fictional elements as he could imagine; and many readers, perhaps misunderstanding Styron's agenda, are liable to dispute and even attack the fictional material for various reasons.  Since this is not a biography, Styron was violating no ethical taboos by employing artistic license where he saw fit.    The novel begins with Turner sitting in a jail cell awaiting trial for his bloody crimes and delivering to his lawyer, Thomas Gray, what will be recorded in history as his \\"confessions.\\"  Speaking his bilious, violent words with precision, insight, and erudition, Nat tells the story of his life in a series of flashbacks, beginning with his childhood at the plantation of a wealthy miller named Samuel Turner, where his mother was a cook and therefore enjoyed a few more privileges than did most of the other slaves.  Nat was a bright boy who, when he demonstrated a desire to learn how to read, was taught the Bible by Samuel Turner's wife and daughter.  When financial ruin befell the Turner family, Nat was sold to a variety of owners until he finally came into the possession of a wheelwright namedJoseph Travis.      As a sincerely devout man who strove to suppress his lust and remain celibate, and as probably the only literate black man in the county, Nat became a preacher to the other slaves, who were granted some liberties on Sundays but were not allowed to assemble.  The hatred he had been nursing towards white people culminated on a day he received a divine vision to kill them all, to assume the role of a murderous Moses leading his people out of bondage to the promised land.  While his friend and closest associate, Hark, enlisted as many slaves as possible for a revolt, he devised plans for the most merciless of massacres that succeeded to the extent that any white Southern sentiment for abolition was consequently cooled for the time being.      Styron is a meticulous, highly disciplined prose artist who writes novels that are compellingly readable and filled with savory details but somehow fail to substantiate themselves beyond the surface.  The compensation for this in \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" is the selection of a loaded and endlessly discussable topic:  Is a man born in chains and consigned to die in chains to be blamed if he attacks his captor in anger?  Turner, in Styron's eyes, would justify the murders as evil for evil, contending that the damage done to blacks by whites is irreparable and the only remaining option is destruction.  Styron calls Nat Turner a psychopath, yet composes a portrait of him that is tense but controlled and, in its thematic denunciation of slavery, roundly empathic.	2004-08-18

This style appeals to me, as it should to all Faulkner fans, but there is a certain sacrifice of substance to achieve the effect McCarthy obviously desired.  The small details, the picturesque scenes, the dramatic situations he conjures are the work of a master, but these feel like mere window dressing when the characters are plumbed for depth, only to find the string is barely wet.  <br /> <br />The plot could be described in a way that would be immediately enticing to potential readers:  A boy named John Wesley Rattner (a Methodist?) growing up in the mountains of eastern Tennessee during the Depression, an essentially good kid who enjoys fishing and trapping, is told by his pious mother that someday he will find and kill the man who murdered his father.  One day he pulls a man out of a wrecked car in a creek; this turns out to be Marion Sylder, a bootlegger who, unbeknownst to Rattner, happens to be his father's murderer. <br /> <br />As Rattner and Sylder, each completely oblivious to the other's relationship to Rattner's father, begin a friendship, the novel traces a twisting story among various members of the community, giving a clear view of life in a rustic setting that is well served by McCarthy's style.  Looming in the background is a wizened old man named Arthur Ownby whom everybody calls Uncle Ather and who is like a legendary figure of nature, the human soul of the mountains, living almost as a druidical hermit and resenting any intrusion into his privacy. <br /> <br />The elements are all in place, but while I was reading this novel I couldn't help but think of a similar but better one that came out around the same time, William H. Gass's \\"Omensetter's Luck,\\" which likewise offers a complex story in a shady, enigmatic tone but more distinctive and original characterization.  \\"The Orchard Keeper\\" falls short of its goal, but it is an admirable effort that portends the brilliance that McCarthy would manifest in \\"Blood Meridian,\\" possibly the best American novel of the 1980s. <br /> <br />	2004-08-18

Each of the twenty-one chapters is named after an element of the periodic table which relates directly or metaphorically to the topic Levi discusses in that chapter.  For example, in \\"Hydrogen,\\" he recalls an amusing electrolysis  experiment he performed as a teenager with a budding interest in chemistry.  To prove to a skeptical friend that a battery driving an electric current through a beaker of water produced a quantity of hydrogen gas, he holds a match to the opening of a glass jar filled with this premier element, exploding and shattering it in an inadvertently symbolic demonstration of the Big Bang. <br /> <br />\\"The Periodic Table\\" is not an autobiography because it intermixes other types of narratives with anecdotes from Levi's uncommonly interesting life.  He was raised in the Jewish community of the Piedmont region in northwest Italy during the reign of Mussolini: \\"noble, inert, and rare,\\" in the chapter called \\"Argon,\\" is how he describes his Spanish-bred ancestors who never quite assimilated Italian gentile customs.  His education was conducted under the ominous shadow of Hitler's conquest of Europe, and by the time he received his doctorate in 1941, \\"the world was racing to catastrophe.\\"  Despite civil laws that tried to separate Jews from gentile society, he was offered a series of professional jobs in a variety of analytical capacities. <br /> <br />His career was interrupted--this is an understatement--by imprisonment at Auschwitz, where he and a friend working in a laboratory came across sticks of cerium which they tried to turn into flint for the sake of bartering goods.  Many years later, while investigating a defective resin for a varnish manufacturer, Levi had an opportunity to correspond with a German man named Muller whom he had known as a civilian inspector at the laboratory and confront him with questions about the atrocities that were condoned.   <br /> <br />After the war, Levi's work as a consultant brought him some intriguing cases.  A cobbler came to him one day with a parcel of sugar, a gift from a rival cobbler, and asked him to inspect it for poison.  A cosmetics manufacturer hired him to find out why his lipstick was running; here we are fed Levi's opinion that a red dye called alloxan, whose molecule comprises two nitrogen, two hydrogen, four carbon, and four oxygen atoms, has a \\"pretty structure.\\"  Indeed, it's difficult to deny the neatness of its symmetry (Levi shows us a diagram), for such symmetry usually indicates a durability analogous to that of sturdily designed engineering structures. <br /> <br />One of the two \\"external\\" narratives takes place in the Bronze Age and is told by a sage named Rodmund from barbarian lands of the north who travels the world searching for lead with which to craft useful items; he is a pioneering metallurgist.  Mercury is the subject of another, in which an English sailor discovers a vein of quicksilver under the volcano which forms the small desolate island on which he lives.  These two chapters enter the realm of imaginative fiction and are like the irresistible icing on an already rich cake. <br /> <br />Levi writes about chemistry and the techniques of chemical analysis with professional assurance but also with the lucid language of a novelist eager to tell a fascinating story.  Non-chemists need not be intimidated by the subject matter because Levi is the most welcoming of writers, willing to share his knowledge but never pedantic and, surprisingly, never pretentious in his literary aspirations; he is as much at home with the pen as he is with the Pyrex. <br /> <br />	2004-08-16
US	49396726	RDQMHBM1XSHG8	0156007754	787923440	Blindness (Harvest Book)	Books	5	4	7	N	N	White out	\\"Blindness\\" seems to be Jose Saramago's most famous novel, indeed as much a media event as a work of literature.  Anybody can write an end-of-the-world horror story (just ask Stephen King), but Saramago goes far beyond the expectations of anyone who approaches this book lured by the sensationalistic premise.  That the characters have considerable depth and authenticity is even more amazing when you consider that Saramago gives them no names and reveals little about their personal histories.  Nor does he even specify the city or country in which the novel takes place, which seems appropriate, for what is the use of formalities when everybody in the world is blind? <br /> <br />It all begins when a man sitting in traffic waiting for a red light to change is suddenly struck blind, whereupon several bystanders lead him to safety.  His blindness happens to be \\"white,\\" in that his sight is obliterated by complete whiteness as though he were submerged in a sea of milk.  The ophthalmologist to whom his wife takes him can't find anything wrong with his eyes and therefore advises further tests.  Later the ophthalmologist (from now on called simply the doctor) suddenly goes blind, as do several of the people with whom the original man came into close contact that day.  This blindness is apparently the result of a contagious illness, and soon the Government decides to quarantine the infected in a disused mental hospital before the blindness becomes pandemic. <br /> <br />The hospital, probably not unlike leper colonies of old, is no better than a concentration camp, depriving the inmates of basic human rights and essentials and guarded by soldiers who are ordered to shoot anybody who tries to escape.  Saramago focuses the action on a few of the unfortunate inmates--the doctor, his wife who is only feigning blindness to be with her husband, the original man (repeatedly called the \\"first blind man,\\" a sort of Adamic quality) and his wife, an old man with an eyepatch, a girl who is a prostitute, and a little boy who whines for his mother.   <br /> <br />Saramago masterfully turns the hospital into a sociological study, giving chaos the reigning hand as hundreds of people who can't see try, mostly unsuccessfully, to learn how to live with each other.  A baser human element comes into play as well: Somebody sneaks in a gun, which inevitably leads to a tribalistic gang society in which the thugs confiscate all incoming food and dole it out to the other wards in exchange for money and sex; catastrophes, far from inspiring compassion and charity, only make some people more selfish in their panic.  The doctor's wife, ostensibly the only person in the world left with her sight, becomes by default the caretaker of the little group, the reluctant Universal Mother, finding them food and guiding their way. <br /> <br />\\"Blindness\\" is a thrilling roller coaster ride of emotions and suspense, darkened with sickening and frightening images, but beneath its surface is a mordant and intelligent examination of humanity.  There are also the more general themes of governmental oppression as a reaction to a national crisis, the devaluation of power and money when everybody is reduced to same miserable condition, and religion as a refuge for those who don't yet feel forsaken, although an eerie scene in a church late in the novel shows that even a pious man, believing he was made in God's image, may try to blind a God who blinds his people.  This is the kind of novel that is commonly thought to be an extended metaphor, that begs to have its symbols identified and deciphered; but don't be blind to its pure enjoyability.    <br /> <br />	2004-08-10
US	49396726	R1KDDBUJDZG1ES	0156106809	350258102	The Baron In The Trees	Books	5	49	49	N	N	A kingdom among the foliage	Like most of Italo Calvino's fiction, &quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot; is pure enchantment that charms the reader into an alternate reality with the warmth of subtle humor and the pioneering spirit, similar to Borges's, that desires to explore fascinating new literary territory within the context of world history. In this novel, set in Italy in the late eighteenth century, Calvino tells the story of a young baron named Cosimo Piovasco di Rondo who lives with his eccentric family in a villa on the edge of the town of Ombrosa. One day when he is twelve years old, after an argument with his parents (about having to eat snails), he runs out to the garden and climbs an oak, declaring that he will spend the rest of his life in the trees and vowing never to set foot on the earth again. <br />  <br /> Like an arboreal Robinson Crusoe who has chosen his fate, Cosimo determines to make his living in the contiguous group of trees that link his family's garden with those of his neighbors and the forests beyond the town. He travels between trees by climbing and jumping from branch to branch, becoming as nimble and elusive as a squirrel, while he trains himself to survive by hunting wild animals for food and clothing and building a flume to draw drinking water from a waterfall. Even in the trees he engages in activities normally reserved for people on the ground: He continues his formal education, befriends a dachshund that helps him hunt, supports a bumbling brigand's reading habit, and even has an adventure on a pirate ship without touching the deck.  <br />  <br /> Through his life in the trees, Cosimo becomes notorious throughout Europe and attains a reputation for madness that gradually turns into a strange sort of esteem. He converses with strangers, meets a group of Spanish exiles who also happen to be tree-dwellers, becomes a writer and natural scientist, and wins the hearts of many ladies who provide him with sexual gratification--in the branches, of course. Far from becoming a Rousseauian savage or a hermit, however, he remains quite civilized and gregarious; his palpable wisdom and curious residence ironically earn him more respect than he would get from the people if he were just a normal land-dwelling baron.  <br />  <br /> Calvino presents the story as a biography narrated by Cosimo's younger brother Biagio, who with affectionate patience describes in vivid detail every aspect of Cosimo's life and is quite hilarious in his explanations of their beleaguered father, militaristic mother, and gruesome, mischievous sister Battista, a &quot;kind of stay-at-home nun.&quot; His efforts to explain Cosimo require him to delve into the mind of a political philosopher who aspires to be as influential as Machiavelli: When his father admonishes him that living in trees does not befit a nobleman, Cosimo replies that a true leader is someone who has ideas and communicates them to the people, not a man with an inherited title. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot; may be read as a parable about withdrawing from reality and creating an isolated fantasy world in which to live free from the constraints of society as the ultimate expression of individuality, or as just a wonderful fable about a boy becoming a man on his own terms. One thing is sure: you'll never look at a tree the same way again. <br />  <br />	2004-08-01

In addition to painting, playing the piano, and condescendingly visiting the poor, she is what might be called a social organizer, which primarily means finding husbands for single women and arranging all the social details involved in doing so. Her decision not to marry stems from her opinion, conceited but sincere, that there's not a man out there who could entertain her as a lifemate; and besides, with her mother pushing up daisies and her older sister Isabella living away in her own marriage, she already has a husband: her father.  <br />  <br /> Jane Austen's novel weaves a group of several characters, balanced almost equally between men and women, into a web of romance in which the reader is led through various scenes and situations in a guessing game of who will end up with whom. Emma makes herself the prime mover of this group, but she is not as infallible a love broker as she would like to think. After she has successfully matched her childhood governess Miss Taylor with an affluent man named Weston, she turns her attention to the naive and impressionable Harriet Smith, for whom she has identified the young vicar Mr. Elton as a suitable beau. But then Elton declares his love for Emma, who of course is not interested in him, and...oh, what a mess. <br />  <br /> The plot thickens when a pretty girl named Jane Fairfax arrives in town to inspire Emma's curiosity and jealousy because she, unlike Harriet, is charming enough not to need Emma's assistance and tutelage. The main heartthrob among the women is Frank Churchill, actually Weston's son from a previous marriage, an impulsive and not totally honest young man whose amorous unpredictabilities shake the foundations of Emma's schemes. The man designed to be a traditional hero is George Knightley, sixteen years Emma's senior, who acts as Emma's moral anchor and monitors her matchmaking endeavors, gently cutting her down to size when her head gets a little too big, such as when she tells him that Robert Martin, a farmer, isn't of the proper class to be Harriet's husband.  <br />  <br /> Austen maintains the right narrative pace, giving her major characters just enough room to develop themselves plausibly through interactions with some colorful minor characters. Emma's father, the slow-on-the-uptake Mr. Woodhouse, a man of extreme sensitivity to gastronomical disorders and temperature fluctuations, is an innocuous but amiable fellow who appreciates his daughter's loyal devotion but is judiciously content to remain in the background of her life and activities. The Highbury seniors are represented by the elderly Mrs. Bates and her slightly less elderly daughter Miss Bates, who has a marvelous talent for prattling about trifles in which nobody else is interested. She can be outdone only by Miss Suckling, the annoying chatterbox Elton decides to marry after being jilted by Emma. <br />  <br /> Emma is not a bad or cruel person--she genuinely feels guilty about Harriet's continual romantic misfortunes and her own momentary sarcastic behavior towards Miss Bates. However, it cannot be denied that she's a snob whose goal is a Perfect Society with all the right ladies married to the right men, and to hell with all those other little people (the farmers, the servants, the unattractive, etc.) who don't fit into her master plan. But Austen herself admitted this much, showing that Emma is far from perfect herself and allowing her to learn a lesson in humility by the end of the novel, for which she is duly rewarded--the denouement is a little too neat, but of a style so familiar to us by now that &quot;Emma&quot; seems nearly two centuries ahead of its time. <br />  <br />	2004-07-29
US	49396726	REYX4YHTTONJ	0140150412	185941076	The Portable Voltaire (Portable Library)	Books	5	104	106	N	N	The crusher of infamy	&quot;The Portable Voltaire&quot; is an excellent compendium of the major works of the man who became the most famous iconoclast of the French Enlightenment.  One of the attractions of this particular volume is the introduction by Ben Ray Redman, who delivers with witty, flowing prose an extremely interesting short biography and a summary of the man's philosophy.  Normally I don't bother to mention a book's introduction in a review, but Redman's is so good I make a notable exception. <br />Voltaire was a man of contrasts.  He was sickly and feeble but miraculously managed to extend his lifespan to eighty-four years, travel abroad, and survive in prison; he was made wealthy by various benefactors and seemed generally happy but could be very cynical and antagonistic in his writing; and most notoriously, he was a deist whose hatred of Christianity could make him appear to be an atheist.  Most of what he hated about Christianity was the clergy--their hypocrisy, their adherence to practices he found absurd, their conceit that everything in the universe is made exclusively for man's consumption and amusement--and the superstition and fanaticism exhibited by the more extreme practitioners of the faith.<br />Nowhere are his themes more vigorously pronounced than in the novella &quot;Candide,&quot; his most famous achievement.  Candide is a simpleminded, ingenuous young man who, under the influence of his tutor Dr. Pangloss, apparently a caricature of the German mathematician-philosopher Leibnitz, steadfastly continues to believe the world as designed is optimal, where everything happens for the ultimate best, even while an endless string of ridiculous circumstances sends him on a series of adventures searching for his lost lover Cunegonde and forces him to bear witness to a theater of war, brutality, murder, rape, chaos, catastrophes, and nonsense, the only wordly haven being the utopian city of gold El Dorado in the mountains of Peru.<br />The other novella, &quot;Zadig,&quot; is similar but paints a more optimistic picture of fate.  Here, the Babylonian nobleman Zadig is a virtuous man whose every act of virtue brings him a new misfortune because of other people's avarice, jealousy, or foolishness, but who always succeeds because of his will and cleverness rather than divine justice.  As in &quot;Candide,&quot; its hero is cast into a world of picaresque adventure and fateful encounters, but he eventually meets a hermit who teaches him that evil events induce, in various and unintended ways, good acts in response.  We live our lives and protect one another as well as we can, as though we could not rely on God to do so for us.   <br />In the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary,&quot; of which this volume contains a portion, Voltaire selects some terms and concepts from philosophy, religion, and politics, and writes a mini-essay on each that expresses his thoughts on the subject.  For example, under &quot;tolerance&quot; he fires off a powerful indictment of bigots and those who think they are superior to others; under &quot;government&quot; he observes that no nation seems to be ruled by its own people, and the examples he gives are quite convincing.<br />Like most philosophers of his day, Voltaire looked back at history with a hard eye to see exactly how Europe had gotten itself into its current situation, and looked ahead to see that it had no hope for the triumph of reason as long as its people were under the yoke of a tyrannous church.  He had no answer for the question &quot;Why do bad things happen to good people?&quot;, but he would emphasize that neither does anyone else, no matter how much they pretend to.	2004-07-19

One of the principal messages in the Judeo-Christian tradition is that of the importance of personal virtue, and many images and stories in this tradition instruct us by illustration either real or fictional about virtue's rewards, that he or she who acts in an acceptable manner will reap worldly (and heavenly) benefits.  By somewhat of a contrast, Aristotle had contended that virtue is its own reward, that is, to be virtuous is to be happy, and he expounds this idea in the body of writings called the Nicomachean Ethics.<br />Defining virtue as a desirable state of character, Aristotle enumerates the different categories of virtue--courage, temperance, thrift, modesty--and proceeds to explain that the ideal human state is one that seeks the mean, or intermediate, quantity of each of these virtues, the excess or deficiency of which is called a vice.  For example, a deficiency of courage, called timidity, is certainly a vice; but likewise an excess of courage, called rashness, is faulty behavior as well.  (An &quot;excess&quot; of a virtue may sound like a good thing, but Aristotle means an excess in the sense of lacking judgment or wisdom; for example, stepping in front of a speeding car may take courage, but it is more accurately described as rashness and would not be considered by anybody to be virtuous behavior, unless there were a higher purpose in doing so, such as to save someone else's life.  But rashness is at least closer to the virtuous mean than is timidity.)<br />To those that would say that virtue has rewards outside of itself, Aristotle might reply that virtue rather has effects or consequences.  A man who attains virtue earns pride, which is the &quot;crown of the virtues&quot; despite the fact that in a different context it can be regarded as a deficiency of modesty, and therefore is happy.  A virtuous man is likely to exercise justice (a man who performs a just act is just only if the act is voluntary) and equity (if you steal a man's watch, you owe him a watch), and this behavior wins him friendship (with other people of similar virtue, of course; evil people gain evil friends), which results in pleasure (no man is an island).<br />Unlike the sophists, Aristotle is not teaching virtue or dispensing advice to his students (one of whom was Alexander the soon-to-be-Great) to make them more virtuous; he is suggesting that virtue may be developed by observing the effects of our behavior, since none of us is perfect.  Virtue is not a state of perfection but an understanding of how to minimize our tendency to submit to our baser impulses.erent context it can be regarded as a deficiency of modesty, and therefore is happy.

Pulham, Esquire,&quot; is the story of a man who is looking back on his life and contemplating the two women he has loved, one his wife and the other the woman he left long ago.  Henry Pulham, the subject and narrator, is a blue-blooded Bostonian who seems to exemplify the proper American man in the first half of the twentieth century--a prep school kid who went to Harvard, served in World War I, and is now a successful investment counselor in the prime of his life and career.<br />Given this premise, a more cynical, pessimistic novel might try to make Pulham out to be secretly miserable, and a more simplistic one might try to turn him into a moral paragon, a Promethean hero who suffers for a sacrifice; but Marquand's vision of him is what each of us could be, a little bit of every man.  Pulham has a wife, Kay, and two teenage children, a son who is lazy and insolent and a daughter who is abnormally immature for her age.  This seems to be the family that was always his destiny, and he is generally happy with the arrangement despite the occasional quarrel.<BR> <BR>After the war, Pulham's best friend from Harvard, Bill King, gets him a job at a New York advertising agency where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful, vivacious young woman named Marvin Myles, who is a completely new type of girl to him--an independent woman who triumphed over hardships to earn herself a professional career at a time when women rarely had the opportunities to do so--and nothing like the spoiled, sheltered, superficial girls he knew growing up, one of whom was Kay.  Why he did not stay with Marvin may have had something to do with his family's prejudice that she wouldn't be the &quot;right&quot; girl for him to marry, whereas Kay was a part of his world and therefore a supposedly better choice.  The life that could have been, and the suspicion that Kay, after all these years, may be having an affair with Bill King, are the conflicts Pulham examines in his narration. <BR> <BR>There are no shocking revelations and none of the violent drama that a tawdrier novel might try to contrive; instead, we get a very sincere and realistic look at a man who is laying his life bare without expecting sympathy or admiration.  Marquand's language is crisp and unpretentious, giving his narrator an affable tone--wise, mature, sober, comfortable with his privileged upbringing but never snobbish.  It is indicative of Pulham's state of mind that of all the books he could be reading, he is currently trying to finish the &quot;Education&quot; of fellow Harvard alumnus Henry Adams, also an aristocratic Bostonian who devoted himself to the study of the course of his baffling life.  <br />Unfortunately by now this novel seems to be almost completely forgotten, lost in the dustbins of twentieth-century American period pieces, struggling to stay in print in a new century that claims to have different values and urgencies.  Granted, it does not approach the majesty of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; or the depth of &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; but as a faithful chronicle of the American zeitgeist it deserves a better fate--if novels of comparable quality and scope like John O'Hara's &quot;Appointment in Samarra,&quot; Sinclair Lewis's &quot;Babbitt,&quot; and Walker Percy's &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; can survive, why not Pulham?  I would hate to think that cultural elitism plays a part in its obscurity.	2004-07-10

Looking with jealousy towards their larger, warmer sunward planetary neighbor, they have decided to take over Earth, where they can build a new civilization.<br />Meanwhile on Earth, astronomers, their telescopes pointed towards Mars, notice strange luminous flashes on the surface of the red planet; these, it can be surmised, are the Martians launching their interplanetary spacecrafts towards their target.  A few months later the crafts land in the English countryside one at a time; it turns out the Martians have traveled in gigantic cylinders which contain all their equipment, including their land vehicles--tall walking tripods with rotating control centers that look like hooded human heads--which evidently are stored in parts and need to be assembled.  These machines have weapons that deploy &quot;Heat-Rays&quot; which roast anything on contact and dense black powder which poisons the air and water.  With these undeniably cool toys, the Martians have no problems advancing towards London and decimating every living thing in their path.<br />Undiplomatic and incommunicative with earthlings, the Martians are cold-blooded killers with possibly the ultimate goal of enslaving the human species for labor in their colonies.  The Martian beings themselves are described as vaguely globular, tentacular monsters that are mostly brain and little else, creatures seemingly borrowed from the distant future of Wells's imagination in &quot;The Time Machine.&quot;  What I found most original and bizarre about them was Wells's description of their machinery, which does not use wheels or any kind of angular mechanism, but rather complex systems of sliding parts on curved surfaces--in other words, their mechanisms approximate biomechanisms.  Their cleverness is indeed formidable, but their information about Earth is lacking in one important area which causes their downfall.<br />The human characters in the novel are hardly worth mentioning, especially the narrator, which is probably why he doesn't have a name; he is used simply as an eyewitness to relate the events.  The Martians and their incredible machines were the only things that really drew my interest because Wells is at his best when he invokes the horror of the unknown rather than the realities of human behavior.  Upon its first appearance, this novel must have struck many Victorians as distastefully grotesque, the idea of a cataclysmic war (at the dawn of the century that invented the cataclysmic war) the willful nightmare of a madman; but Wells was a visionary if not the most elegant writer, and visionaries sometimes shock us.rre about them was Wells's description of their machinery, which does not use wheels or any kind of angular mechanism, but rather complex systems of sliding parts on curved surfaces--in other words, their mechanisms approximate biomechanisms.

US	49396726	R21QPKBMM9TWNC	0394710487	377678395	Collected Stories	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Some gems of Irish short fiction	That realism has a natural humor which needs no embellishment or exaggeration seems to be the guiding principle of the fiction of Frank O'Connor, whose nearly seventy short stories of the lower and middle class in Ireland, many of which were originally published in the New Yorker at a time when the magazine was the authority for the best new short fiction, are gathered in this collection published by Vintage.  His settings are localized to villages and towns; his stories, unlike the plays of Sean O'Casey, give little indication of the Irish political situation of the twentieth century, rarely even mentioning the World Wars, and instead focus primarily on religion, marriage, and childhood.  <br />O'Connor's portrayals of the church and the clergy, ranging from the slyly satirical to the somberly sympathetic, illuminate the influence of Catholicism on the Irish mentality and the often strained relationships between priests and their parishioners.  In \\"News for the Church,\\" a teenage girl goes to confession for carnal intercourse with an older man, but the priest cynically guesses she is merely brandishing a badge of honor to prove her sexual maturity to her married older sister.  O'Connor sees the unrewarding side to being a moral compass, but he never suggests that a priest's work is all in vain.   <br />Many of the stories are about the confusion of youth and are narrated by a child with the voice of an adult.  \\"The Man of the House,\\" for example, struck me as a quasi-parable of the Fall, an adult-oriented parody of a morality tale that is told to children:  A boy (the narrator) is entrusted by his sick mother to procure for her a bottle of cough syrup, but a bewitching girl he meets at the drug store tricks him into sharing the temptingly sweet medicine with her, leaving him to face the consequences of his mischief.  These stories tend to culminate in poignant moments that, while not exactly equaling the Joycean epiphanies of \\"Dubliners,\\" resonate with aching truthfulness.  <br />One of the most pointed stories explores a curious contrast between the Irish and the English:  In \\"The Sentry,\\" an Irish priest with a Catholic parish in England during World War II discovers an English soldier stealing onions from his garden and challenges the man to a fistfight.  When the priest later learns that the soldier--a sentry--could be shot for deserting his post, he tells this to an Irish nun, who replies, \\"Isn't that the English all out?  The rich can do what they like, but a poor man can be shot for stealing a few onions!\\"  Of course, the point is that the soldier would be shot for deserting his post, not for stealing onions; but the subtext of the nun's statement is that the Irish tend to see the bigger picture.<br />O'Connor is a natural dramatist with an uncommon ear for sincere, fluidly colloquial dialogue; he never overdoes a situation because he trusts the inherent strength and vitality of his characters to draw our interest.  Here we have a collection of people who delineate the culture of their nation, always remaining fiercely individualistic, speaking the same language as the English but refusing to identify with them.	2004-07-02
US	49396726	RVX0G05S5YK9A	0446691291	4003610	Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds	Books	4	15	17	N	N	The Bloom 100	This thick book is Harold Bloom's meditation on literary genius, by which he means not exactly an extraordinary intelligence but a communication with the &quot;God within,&quot; an internal source of world-expanding creative inspiration, that only few people manage to achieve.  He selects one hundred authors -- the list, he stresses, is by no means hermetic -- in the literary canon who in his estimation have done this, subdividing them into ten groups of ten, each group represented by a concept from the Kabbalah called a Sefirah.  For example, under Hesed, or &quot;God's covenant love for men and women,&quot; he locates Donne, Pope, Swift, Austen, and others who he feels manifest various aspects (especially irony, one of his favorite topics) of such love.   <br />Which authors have genius?  Shakespeare, obviously, and all the classical poets whose works have survived for a number of centuries, and Bloom's personal hero of literary criticism, Samuel Johnson, and even T.S. Eliot, towards whom Bloom displays a dichotomous attitude of admiration mixed with hostility.  What evidence of genius is offered that elevates these authors above the merely talented?  For Renaissance historian and prose stylist extraordinaire Walter Pater, it is his &quot;secularization of the religious epiphany&quot;; for Balzac, it is his mercurial comic criminal Vautrin; for Robert Browning, it is his perfected development of the dramatic monologue.  <br />I regard Bloom's opinions very highly and respect his efforts to rescue the best literature of the ages from forced obsolescence by the authorities of ephemeral ideologies in what he considers to be the intellectually decadent academic institutions, but I'm not blind to his idiosyncrasies as a critic (call them &quot;Bloomisms&quot;) for which he surely would not apologize and which anybody approaching his criticism for the first time has to keep in mind.  The most notable is his insistence on putting just about everything literary in relation to Shakespeare's major characters: Hamlet, Falstaff, Iago, Macbeth, and Lear.  Next is his tendency to make thunderous declarations and magisterial assertions of canonical rank (&quot;Proust is the last of the great novelists&quot;) which will hardly persuade an unimpressionable reader who isn't looking for a lecture.<br />Past this, you will find that Bloom is so enthusiastic about the world's greatest literature and writes so well about his passion that it is immediately infectious.  His desire is to motivate his readers to become better readers by demanding the highest standards, and so he isn't reticent about using superlatives to make his points.  His dedication to literary quality highlights the book's greatest usefulness, which is to introduce or uncover important authors that are overlooked by or unknown to a large portion of readers; Montaigne, Saint Augustine, Carpentier, and Hart Crane are not widely read today, but Bloom argues cogently that they should be because their work is substantial and still relevant.  Also, those authors whose works are of considerable cognitive difficulty are made more accessible to the common reader by Bloom's helpful clarifications of their themes.  <br />&quot;Genius&quot; is indeed bloated, but its bloat is of mostly informative commentary and more than a few entertaining quips.  Bloom can be provocative: &quot;Emma Bovary is Gustave Flaubert, and almost all the rest of us as well.&quot;  Or humorous: &quot;Dante, like the rest of us, suffered a great deal, but many of us would be hesitant before we peopled Hell with our personal enemies,&quot; he says about the &quot;Inferno.&quot;  Or incisive: &quot;Freud, who wanted to be a third with Copernicus and Darwin, became a third with Montaigne and Goethe,&quot; he says about Freud's success as a mythmaking essayist despite, or perhaps as a result of, his (failed) aspirations to be a scientific revolutionary.  He can also be pedantic and often acrimonious when mentioning hisacademic opponents; but most importantly he, more than any other current critic, is gracious enough to put up the signposts on the long, winding highway of Western literature, and for that reason I'm willing to take his side.  After all, what have the ideological cheerleaders ever done for me?	2004-06-25
US	49396726	R3F5AQVNF8MHG1	0449242595	820533569	The Coup	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Updikean drama of the Third World	&quot;The Coup&quot; is strange subject matter for John Updike -- a novel about, and narrated by, the president of a fictional Marxist Islamic central African nation called Kush, formerly a French protectorate, now (as of the 1970s) allied with the Soviets.  Although the narrator, Colonel Hakim Felix Ellellou, holds the office of president of Kush's governing council, he is effectively a dictator; but unlike Stalin or Saddam Hussein, he does not have his face enshrined in every public place, and prefers to be known only by name so he can travel around his country incognito when he wants to inspect various operations.  Presently he is presiding over a national crisis: Kush is suffering from a long drought, his people are starving, and there is little he can do about it.  <br />Ellellou unsurprisingly resents America, the world's greatest exponent of capitalism and tacky culture, &quot;that fountainhead of obscenity and glut,&quot; as he calls it.  &quot;Offer your own blacks freedom before you pile boxes of carcinogenic trash on the holy soil of Kush,&quot; he haughtily tells an American aid worker just before his legions make a bonfire out of a large supply of donated food which engulfs the unfortunate man who brought it.  His attitude stems from the time he spent there in the 1950s as a student at a small college in Wisconsin, where he met several other black students including a member of the Nation of Islam who helped to fuel his hatred towards whites.  This was also where he met a WASPish white girl named Candy Cunningham, who, spiting her family, became one of his wives when he moved back to Kush.  (Observing the polygamy allowed to him by Islam, Ellellou has three other wives he keeps in separate homes, and a mistress named Kutundu who figures significantly in his imminent downfall.)     <br />Ellellou is not the nicest guy in the world, but Updike gives him a voice that makes him strangely likeable over the course of the novel.  Referring to himself alternately in the first and third person, Ellellou recounts the recent history of Kush, the original coup that brought him to power and the mostly bloodless one that subsequently ousted him, the object lesson of which is that power easily won is just as easily lost.  He grimly recalls the execution he personally performed on the exiled former king of Kush, Edumu, whom he had (somewhat unjustifiably) accused of tyranny and blasphemy against Allah.  A similar fate could have befallen him when his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Michaelis Ezana, engineers a brighter future for Kush by opening its doors to American commerce, but fortunately after his own coup, Ellellou is merely consigned to taking jobs as a short order cook and a parking garage attendant.  <br />Ellellou is an intelligent man but a political fool, and the novel's implication may be that communism is destined to fail less because of its ideological weakness than because its egomaniacal leaders simply don't know how to lead.  Updike's garish prose style is a familiar element here, and the African setting gives him the opportunity to exercise his considerable descriptive abilities in an exotic context, although as good at that as he is, the cutaway views detailing his protagonist's culture-clashing experiences in America show that he is most comfortable and convincing in the literary vivisection of his own country.	2004-06-13
US	49396726	R1U235W2N7RZBY	0141439599	590612959	Tess of the D'Urbervilles (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Somber rustic majesty	In a certain light, Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" might be seen as a Cinderella story horribly disfigured by a tragic twist.  When we first meet the heroine, Tess Durbeyfield, as a poor, hardworking farm girl who has to take care of her five younger siblings and fulfill the responsibilities abandoned by her inebriated father, she seems like a girl destined for greater things: a brilliant career in a more stimulating occupation, a blissful marriage to a wonderful man.  But Hardy likes to illustrate fate's capacity for cruelty, and Tess is merely an innocent woman who is seemingly punished for her innocence.<br />The name Durbeyfield is a vulgarization of d'Urberville, a family with a rich history descended from Norman knights and wealthy landowners, but various misfortunes have reduced the lineage to the commoners who presently inhabit the impoverished Durbeyfield household.  (We learn later in the novel that the Durbeyfields are not the only local family to have suffered this appellative fall from grace.)  Although the d'Urberville nobility is defunct, in the near past an enterprising businessman named Stoke sought to increase the prestige of his own family by appropriating a distinguished name from the county annals, and d'Urberville is the one he chose.  Thus when Tess, to aid her family's finances after an unfortunate accident deprives them of their income, takes a job tending the fowl at the nearby d'Urberville estate, she mistakenly believes she is working for her relations.<br />This ostensibly minor detail is really the basis of the irony which drives the novel.  Had Mr. Stoke been honest and not assumed the name of the Durbeyfields' ancestors, Tess would not have been likely to meet the lecherous, skulking Alec d'Urberville, who rapes her after she rebuffs his attempted seduction and impregnates her with a baby that dies in infancy.  Of course Hardy, evading the risk of censorship, is decorous enough to suggest in the subtlest manner possible that the rape happened rather than describe it explicitly, but Alec's immoral behavior is clearly implied.<br />Mortified, heartbroken, Tess then goes to work as a milkmaid at a dairy farm where she and a young man named Angel Clare, the heartthrob of several of the farm girls, fall in love.  Angel has defied his father, a vicar, by spurning a career in the clergy for agriculture and marriage with a middle class girl for Tess.  He scoffs at his parents' snobbery, but after marrying Tess, he reveals a disturbing hypocrisy when she confesses to him the vicious treatment she had received from Alec and its consequences.  Angel's reaction is far from the gentle sympathy one would expect from the magnanimous personality he projects; he is disgusted that she has been robbed of her purity and draws a strange parallel between her violation and the fall of her family's ancestral prestige.  He rejects her, they separate, and once again she is mortified, heartbroken, and looking for a job.<br />Tess is destined to rencounter both Angel and Alec before the end of the novel, and the changes to their characters not only advance the plot in unexpected ways but further emphasize Hardy's utilization of irony.  The starkly contrasted images of the novel's penultimate scene at Stonehenge and the last scene, which takes place outside a prison where a black flag flies announcing an execution, raise the question of whether even Hardy knew when he started exactly how this somber story would end.<br />The novel contains several recurring Hardy elements.  Like most of his major work, it takes place in the southwestern part of England he calls Wessex, this time in the fertile Blackmoor Vale, and his evocation of the scenery sets the stage beautifully.  Tess's co-workers at the dairy farm are a realistically cheerful lot and provide the continuum of humanity that such a story needs as a reprieve for its tragic mood.  An interesting touch which shows that Hardy is not above recycling his own motifs is the similarity between the death of the Durbeyfield horse (a definite foreshadowing for Tess) and the tumbling sheep in \\"Far from the Madding Crowd,\\" in that both incidents cause their respective protagonists to take distant jobs with fateful results.  The incentive to read Hardy lies in his ability to put language at the service of one of the greatest functions of literature: to express the deepest desires and emotions of mankind.	2004-06-09
US	49396726	R3G0TGEDYQ1HJ	0811201880	942112163	Nausea (New Directions Paperbook)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Self-absorbed, but not self-admiring	Antoine Roquentin, the protagonist of Sartre's &quot;Nausea,&quot; is a man who stands in awe of himself.  No, he's not an egotist or a narcissist in the self-admiring sense; he is completely and intensely absorbed in the contemplation of his own existence.  That is to say, he constantly ponders the fact he exists, that there is a consciousness connected to a body whose collective name is Antoine Roquentin.  For some, the reaction to such a realization might be wonder and amazement, perhaps an acknowledgement of the omnipotence of a higher power; for Antoine, the reaction is horror, a perception of the void enshrouding existence, leading to a feeling of what he calls nausea.<br />To evade the nausea, Antoine immerses himself in the study of those that have existed in the past, and he is currently in the city of Bouville (possibly a renamed Boulogne), France, researching the history of the Marquis de Rollebon, a courtier of Marie Antoinette and a most adventurous scoundrel.  The ordinariness of Antoine's career emphasizes the absurdity of existence in a world designed for those who are content to live the unexamined life.  At the local library, he makes the acquaintance of a Self-Taught Man (the only name by which he is known) who endeavors to educate himself by reading every book available to him, in alphabetical order.  The Self-Taught Man, an ex-soldier who had spent some time as a prisoner of war, is the essence of bourgeois humanism and optimism; he mistakes Antoine's inquiries into existence for a search for the meaning of life.  Another perspective on existence is given by Antoine's snide ex-girlfriend Anny, whose childhood experiences have led her to the conclusion that death, or dying, is a &quot;privileged situation&quot; because of the importance it is attributed not only in actuality but as the subject in so many works of art, where it is portrayed as the transcendence of existence.<br />Written in the style of a diary, &quot;Nausea&quot; reads like a memoir containing many personalized aphorisms about existence and its opposite, nothingness, which ironically also must exist; but these are too subjective to be universally useful.  Rather, the novel's biggest triumph is the convincing expressiveness of Sartre's protagonist, who manages to convey in lucid language the ideas behind coming to terms with one's own existence.  Antoine may be morose and introverted, but he is an excellent analyst of nature and has intellectual energy to spare.	2004-06-06
US	49396726	RWUIXVLNVNNGL	0151002304	1488898	Too Far Afield	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Perpetuation of the Immortal	Not having read anything by the nineteenth-century German novelist Theodor Fontane has put me at a disadvantage in my reading of Gunter Grass's &quot;Too Far Afield.&quot;  Fontane's life and work, you see, are constant objects of reference in Grass's novel, to the extent that the protagonist, Theo &quot;Fonty&quot; Wuttke, is virtually a reincarnation of Fontane, who died in 1898 but whose memory is exalted by his protege.  Fonty calls his predecessor the Immortal and, reliving his life in many respects, is either actively determined or passively fated to immortalize him.  <br />&quot;Too Far Afield&quot; begins with a chronology of modern German history, which Grass implicatively traces back to 1685 when French Huguenots escaping religious persecution in their native country sought refuge in Prussia; Fontane, as his French-looking name indicates, was descended from Huguenots.  Born in 1919, exactly a century after Fontane, Fonty leads a life that surrealistically parallels that of the Immortal.  Like Fontane, Fonty is a man of letters with a keen interest in the march of war, a renowned poet and one of East Berlin's leading cultural figures since the second World War ended in a geopolitically divided Germany. <br />Grass's narrative takes place mostly in East Berlin in the early 1990s after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  In much the same way that Fontane had chronicled the unification of Germany under Bismarck in the latter half of the nineteenth century, Fonty reflects on the reunification of Germany following the collapse of the Soviet umbrella under which East Germany had been nurtured and the clash of cultures that results when the stagnant communism of the East is awkwardly reconciled with the dynamic capitalism of the West.  <br />Fonty, in addition to his literary endeavors, has worked as a courier in the East German Ministries Building, where he runs files up and down the floors in a rickety elevator affectionately called the &quot;paternoster&quot; (Our Father) -- perhaps after a prayer uttered by the hapless passenger for his safety.  The dissolution of his government after the Wall has fallen temporarily displaces Fonty, but fortunately the Ministries Building is taken over by a trust company called Handover, where he accepts a job as a consultant in their affairs to help reconstruct East Germany.  <br />The political situation provides a backdrop for Fonty's personal dramas.  His daughter Martha, a teacher, having lost her faith in socialism, becomes a Catholic and marries a wealthy West German builder she had met at a resort by the Black Sea several years ago; in this episode we learn that West Germans, whose currency was much more solid than that of the East Germans, received preferential treatment.  Fonty's closest friends are Hoftaller, alias Tallhover, a spy for the former East German government, and the cynical Professor Freundlich, pointedly referred to as a &quot;leftover&quot; Jew, an anti-Zionist who is sour over his daughters' decision to move to Israel but eventually accedes to the view that Europe can never again be a haven for the Jews.  We also learn that Fonty has a granddaughter named Madeleine, the offspring of a daughter he had illegitimately with a French woman while serving ineffectually as a soldier in World War II, who comes to him in his old age.<br />&quot;Too Far Afield&quot; bears little resemblance to Grass's 1959 masterpiece &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (one of the best novels of the last century); of course, &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; did not anticipate a reunified Germany but instead assumed a permanently splintered one symbolized by its deformed protagonist Oskar Matzerath, whose piquant personality Fonty lacks.  &quot;Too Far Afield,&quot; facing the reality of what many Germans including Grass might have thought impossible, is less whimsical, as though it were wandering around in a daze contemplating the unexpected destruction of the physical barrier that had emerged emblematic of the great German divide of the twentieth century. <br />As for myself, I resolve to delve into &quot;Effi Briest&quot; as soon as possible.  Dare I ignore the Immortal any longer?	2004-06-04

But what of the artistic quality of the novella itself?  The outer plot -- involving the detection of Henry Jekyll's double identity by his friend and lawyer Gabriel Utterson -- is the least interesting facet of the story; Stevenson's concept, inspired by a nightmare, and the vivid language he uses to convey it, are what impress the most upon the reader.<br />The respected London scientist Henry Jekyll seems normal enough, but he is fascinated by what he considers to be two distinct sides to his (or, he believes, anybody's) personality, which can be described crudely as good and evil.  He furthermore believes these sides are physically separable, just as water can be separated into its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen, by electrolysis; and so he invents a potion that essentially splits his personality so that only one side will manifest itself while the other becomes latent.  In this way, Jekyll reasons, the &quot;good&quot; side may be an agent of good works without being burdened by the disgrace of an inherent evil, and the &quot;evil&quot; side is free to do his damage without the pangs of remorse he would inherit from the conscience of his good twin.  In Freudian terms, Jekyll is the ego, Hyde is the id, but unfortunately -- and this is the point that drives the story -- Jekyll has no superego to tell him that the potion is an irresponsibly bad idea in the first place.  <br />In society Jekyll retains his high esteem, but his mutation, the sinister, deformed Edward Hyde, whom he names as an heir as a further disguise of his own identity, is cursed to live in ostracism for his hideous appearance, cruel behavior, and disregard for the law.  The fact that Hyde is physically smaller than Jekyll could be symbolic of hismoral deficiency or merely reflect the notion that he is only a &quot;part&quot; of Jekyll; but the difference in size is convenient as a plot device because it prevents others from suspecting that Hyde and Jekyll are really the same person.  <br />One should not approach &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; as if it were just a primitive example of generic horror.  Stevenson excels as a prose writer, suffusing his story with the kind of  descriptive nuances that successfully evoke Victorian London at its darkest and most ominous contrasted with the civilized society of gentlemen and otherwise benevolent scientists.  I was aware that Stevenson was an essayist, but I was unprepared to find that &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is really an illustrative essay at its base, dressed in monstrous fashion.	2004-05-17

Peter Carey's novel achieves its distinction through the intrigue of its premise, which is that the respective backgrounds of the two protagonists are so dissimilar that only a random act of fate could eventually unite them, and only one thing they have in common could keep them together -- they are both compulsive gamblers.  Gambling indeed sends Oscar Hopkins and Lucinda Leplastrier spiraling towards destruction, but in a way that is unexpectedly foolhardy even by the conventions of the addiction.  <br />The story begins by showing Oscar growing up in a provincial English village where he is sheltered by his widowed father, a naturalist and Christian fundamentalist who adheres to an ascetic lifestyle and distrusts the Anglican church.  Oscar, after receiving a divination that he should devote his life to the Anglican faith, leaves his home and goes to live with a local Anglican minister, the Reverend Hugh Stratton, and eventually attends Oxford, where his friend Ian Wardley-Fish introduces him to racetrack betting, of which Stratton would sternly disapprove.  After becoming an Anglican minister, Oscar offers to go to Australia as a missionary, even though gambling has become his most lucrative source of income.<br />Meanwhile, Lucinda, a girl who moved from England to New South Wales with her parents, was orphaned as a teenager and was bequeathed a considerable fortune with which she decides to buy a glassworks in Sydney, not because she has an interest in the manufacture of glass, but because she pities the working class and thinks her ownership of the factory will allow her to associate with Dennis Hasset, a vicar and glass expert to whom she is attracted.  After visiting family friends in England (one of whom is Marian Evans, a.k.a. George Eliot, who is unimpressed with her), she embarks on the return journey to Australia, and it is on the ship that she meets Oscar and discovers they have a common weakness for cards. <br />The novel demonstrates that it is very difficult for a gambling addict to maintain a career in the clergy, and in Oscar's case financial ruin compels him to lodge with Lucinda, which is an obviously controversial situation under the consideration that they are not married.  She dreams romantically of constructing a crystal palace of steel and glass, and Oscar, seeing a model at the glassworks, proposes a real glass church to be donated to Hasset, who now has a vicarage in a distant part of the country.  This leads Oscar to wager a colossal final bet with Lucinda -- that he can transport this church, in sections to be assembled near the site, across land and sea, as a surprise gift to Hasset.     <br />The story is narrated by Oscar's great-grandson, who remains anonymous and pleasantly unobtrusive throughout, and therefore even though the setting is the nineteenth century the mode of narration is thoroughly modern, with the relatively short chapters giving the novel a strong narrative dynamic and a fast pace; this is not a pastiche of the Victorian style.  The image of the glass cathedral at the end is quite striking, not because it is a thing of beauty but because it strives to be a thing of beauty despite its fractured appearance resulting from its tumultuous passage and the death and violence which it has caused and which taint its pretensions to innocence and beatitude.  This unique combination of the sacred and the profane makes &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot; a work of excellence, clearly one of the best novels of the 1980s.	2004-05-10

Hotspur has allied himself with several principal figures including his uncle the Earl of Worcester, his brother-in-law Mortimer the Earl of March, Lord Douglas the Scot, and Owen Glendower, a Welsh chieftain with a vivid mystical imagination -- he is so egotistical that he insists an earthquake that occurred the day of his birth was a divine proclamation of his importance -- and a desire to usurp all of Wales from the king.<br />While he is preparing for war against the rebels, Henry IV laments that his own son Henry (Hal), the Prince of Wales, is a shameful libertine living the high life in London and consorting with a gang of scurrilous miscreants.  Indeed, Prince Hal's idea of fun is robbing people, and his best friend and accomplice in this activity is Sir John Falstaff, who turns out to be not Hal's peer but a middle-aged man.  In a character transformation of an abruptness that can only be described as magical, Hal becomes a serious young man determined loyally to defend his father's kingship from Hotspur's assault after he receives an earnest lecture from his father about the dangers of acting irresponsibly as a public figure.<br />Not enough can be said about Falstaff, who is undoubtedly one of the most richly realized characters in literature.  He is fat, lazy, cowardly, yet boastful, but not in the same way Owen Glendower is -- Owen really believes what he says; Falstaff is just trying to make himself look better than he actually is, but fools nobody because he prevaricates and embellishes without bothering to remember his previous lies for the sake of consistency.  You probably know somebody like this in real life -- especially if you're ten years old.  Falstaff's piquancy, in fact, so outweighs the stature of the other characters that his absence is sorely felt in the scenes in which he does not appear.<br />Most of all, Part One of \\"Henry IV\\" is a play of contrasts personified by Prince Hal and Hotspur, who incidentally is also named Henry.  In their confrontation on the battlefield, it seems unlikely that Hal, who wasted many of his best days living as a rake, could conquer a seasoned warrior like Hotspur in a swordfight.  But there wouldn't be much of a tale to tell if not to show Hal triumphing after his resolution to change his weak habits, and the play ends with the conviction that, despite his past mistakes, he would make a noble king himself.his absence is sorely felt in the scenes in which he does not appear.<br />Most of all, Part One of \\"Henry IV\\" is a play of contrasts personified by Prince Hal and Hotspur, who incidentally is also named Henry.

At the beginning of the novel, Nicholas's father has just died, leaving his family destitute, and Uncle Ralph, a moneylender (specifically, a usurer) and a venture capitalist of sorts, greedy and callous by the requirements of the story, reluctantly feels obligated to help them, and does so by securing for Nicholas a position as headmaster's assistant at a school for boys in Yorkshire, and for Nicholas's sister Kate a job as a dressmaker for a foppish clown named Mr. Mantalini, while Nicholas and Kate's scatterbrained mother is left in her room to mutter incoherent reminiscences about random events in her life.<br />This Yorkshire school, called Dotheboys Hall, turns out to be little more than a prison in the way it is run by its headmaster, an improbably cruel cyclops named Wackford Squeers who badly mistreats and miseducates the students.  Now, historical records indicate that while Squeers may be an exaggeration, his school is definitely not, Dickens intending to warn his readers of the day that some such places were indeed that bad.  The duration at Dotheboys Hall constitutes only a small portion of the novel, but Squeers and his grotesque family reappear throughout the rest of the story like gremlins who are always causing bad things to happen to our hero.<br />Nicholas's fortunes after escaping from Dotheboys Hall with Smike, a particularly abused older boy whom Squeers had worked like a slave, revolve largely around the circumstances of Kate and Uncle Ralph, who is starting to view the young man as a nuisance inclined to interfere in his machinations.  Having been vilified by Squeers for his brash conduct at the Hall, Nicholas takes to the road with Smike in tow, where in Portsmouth they meet a thespian namedVincent Crummles who persuades the fugitives to become actors in his theatrical troupe; this episode, the strangest of Nicholas's adventures, seems more than anything else to reflect Dickens's own interest in the theater.  Eventually Nicholas returns to London and gets a job as a clerk at a counting-house owned by a pair of merchants, the cheery Cheeryble brothers, where he encounters a beautiful girl in distress who will become a major factor in the final showdown between Nicholas and his uncle. <br />The supporting characters are numerous and extremely colorful to the point of cartoonishness, such as Miss La Creevy, a talkative spinster and amateur painter; John Browdie, the gruff Yorkshireman whose dialect is so severe he needs a translator; Sir Mulberry Hawk, the arrogant suitor whom Kates tries to rebuff; Newman Noggs, Uncle Ralph's benevolent clerk who helps our hero when he can.  In fact, the most curious thing about the characterization in this novel is that its main characters are almost completely devoid of personality; Nicholas and Kate, perhaps being by necessity innocuous paragons of virtue, are practically mere mannequins to whom people talk and things happen.  Even the sickly and wretchedly humble Smike, the mystery of whose parentage becomes a part of the plot, does not induce as much pity as Dickens probably intended because he seems trapped in a story that doesn't really want him except as a device to expose even more of Uncle Ralph's villainy.  <br />There is much to like in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;:  The prose is finely detailed, the satire of various types of characters is on target, the humor is sharp -- there is a particularly funny and suspenseful scene with an unexpected outcome in which Nicholas dispatches Newman to discover the identity of the mysterious beautiful girl.  And there is much not to like:  The plot coincidences are ridiculously contrived in typical Dickensian fashion; the drama is manipulative, designed to cheer the reader all the more when the author comes to rescue the heroes from their despair and hopelessness; the sentimentality is overwhelming -- by the end &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; becomes so saccharine it makes &quot;David Copperfield&quot; look like &quot;Blood Meridian.&quot;  But Dickens remains eminently readable because of his flair for portraying and celebrating human oddity in all its varieties, his knowledge that life is all about taking the bad with the good, and his sense that fiction is all about maximizing the contrast.	2004-05-01

This is not to say that the Undershafts don't marry and have families -- the current Andrew Undershaft has married the aristocratic Lady Britomart and has three children by her; he just doesn't let them have anything to do with the family business, preferring to stick to the tradition of bringing in an outsider to perpetuate the Andrew Undershaft dynasty. <br />Indeed, Undershaft feels that poverty is the primordial crime from which all other crimes -- burglary, murder -- spring, and that it is better to give a poor man a job so he can afford to live rather than spend public money on methods of punishing him should he violate the law in his efforts to afford to live.  Undershaft moralizes when he speaks, but in actuality he scoffs at what he considers ordinary Christian morals of the kind professed by his daughter Barbara, who has joined the Salvation Army in her fervid desire to help the poor and has attained the rank of major.  She works at a shelter doling out bread and milk to the downtrodden and trying to find work for the unemployed, but her real goal is to bring them to \\"salvation\\" by raising them to a higher state of spirituality.  When her fiance, a scholar of Greek named Adolphus Cusins, who by a certain twist of logic happens to be his own cousin, reveals himself to be a foundling, Undershaft decides he's found his heir.<br />Although the play reflects the perspectives that Shaw, as a Socialist, had on the effects of poverty on morality and society, he doesn't seem to take sides with his characters and instead lets them be funny within the context of their respective social classes.  His idle rich characters are lovably comical, like the mentally vapid trio of Undershaft's son Stephen (who wouldn't know what to do with his father's armaments business even if he were qualified to inherit it), daughter Sarah, and her fiance Charles Lomax.  His impoverished characters -- those who come to the Salvation Army shelter for handouts -- can be honorably industrious like Peter Shirley or pugnacious and troublesome like Bill Walker.  If Undershaft, for all his willingness to feed his fortune by manufacturing items that shed the blood of millions, represents the right way to fix poverty and Barbara the wrong way, why is the play named after her?  I think it's possibly because her morality is one with which most theatergoers of the day could identify, while Undershaft's is idiosyncratic to say the least.	2004-04-28
US	49396726	R39744PI4ZQ0I4	0375759417	380433990	Selected Poetry of William Wordsworth (Modern Library Classics)	Books	5	41	42	N	N	Wandering lonely as a cloud	To me, poetry is like a swimming pool into which I have to dip my toe to test the temperature of the water before I jump in.  I have to take it just a little bit at a time and allow myself to absorb it as well as enjoy it, and this volume of Wordsworth is something I find accessible and welcoming but challenging enough to engage my interest.  Unlike his contemporaries of the Romantic movement like Blake and Byron who immersed themselves in wild fantasy and dark mythology, Wordsworth writes about things just about everybody can relate to -- nature, neighbors, family, nation, self-realization, glow-worms -- using direct language that avoids obscure metaphors.  Granted, not many of us these days find the opportunity to observe a shepherd at work or hike over the Alps, but Wordsworth did, and tells us about it with imagination and exuberance.<br />The characters in Wordsworth's poems are vagrants, wanderers, beggars, figures from local legends, generally people who live outside of the mainstream or are forgotten by society, the humblest of the humble.  There is Johnny the errant Idiot Boy, who is sent off on a horse to fetch a doctor for his mother's ailing friend but instead takes a personal journey governed by his limited imagination.  There is the isolated Lucy, &quot;a violet by a mossy stone&quot; who &quot;dwelt among the untrodden ways.&quot;  There is old Timothy the Childless Father, who tries sorrowfully to maintain his spirits by continuing his hunting excursions after a period of mourning for the death of his last daughter.<br />The central piece in this collection is &quot;The Prelude,&quot; Wordsworth's autobiographical poem.  After explaining his desire to look beyond traditional poetical subjects like history and chivalry, he proceeds to document the development of his aesthetic, noting the importance of solitude to a budding poet, discussing his years at Cambridge and his undistinguished academic performance, his walking tour through Europe at the time of the French Revolution, and his sympathies for the common man arising from his love of nature.  Several sonnets written around 1803 show him turning his attention to national matters, such as lamentations for England's lack of current literary figures as great as Milton and calls for defense against Napoleonic invasion (&quot;To the Men of Kent,&quot; &quot;In the Pass of Killicranky&quot;).<br />Adoration of nature is Wordworth's most salient attribute, and, having found his pictorial voice from an early age (&quot;An Evening Walk&quot; is astonishingly sophisticated verse for a seventeen-year-old to have written), he devotes the lion's share of his poetry to idylls, pastorals, dithyrambic odes to the beauty of the the landscapes around his boyhood home in Grasmere.  With the exception of some London street scenes in &quot;The Prelude&quot; and elsewhere, there are very few references in his poetry to urbanization and industrialization; reading it, one would think England a permanently medieval country of quiet rustic villages and sparsely populated woodlands.  It would seem that materialism and the chaos of living in an increasingly technological society mattered not at all to Wordsworth, and his poetry has all the more longevity because of it.e of the French Revolution, and his sympathies for the common man arising from his love of nature.

The narrator, whose name is never revealed, is a commercial artist who lives in the city with her boyfriend Joe and is presently working on illustrations for a children's book.  She has been summoned to her native village by a family friend who has reported to her that her father is missing, and, having no car of her own, she has persuaded Joe and her friends David and Anna, a married couple, to give her a ride and make a short summer vacation out of it.  <br />Her childhood home, where her widowed father still lives, is a cabin on a wooded island in a lake near the village.  The cabin is indeed empty, and the most significant clue she finds about her father's disappearance is a set of strange, indecipherable drawings on paper, apparently sketched by him recently.  Did he go mad from self-isolation, or are these drawings a message of something more sinister?  The narrator's quest seems to be motivated more by casual curiosity about what could have happened to him than by filial devotion or fear for his safety; she gives the impression of a woman whose capacity for love has been exhausted.    <br />As might be expected, the four people on the island become entangled in a web of sexual tension.  The narrator, herself divorced and the mother of a child whose fate is never made clear, contemplates her relationship with Joe, a struggling artist like her, who is almost morbidly quiet and becomes sullen when she refuses his request for marriage.  Meanwhile, David and Anna's marriage is on a collision course.  David, a capitalism-hating hippie who reflects the counterculture of the era in which the novel was written, is an obnoxious, slimy fellow who tries (unsuccessfully) to be funny by imitating cartoon characters yet continually intimidates Anna and makes a pass at the narrator in retribution forAnna's infidelity.  Obviously, this is not a man with whom one would want to spend a week at a cabin.  <br />Although \\"Surfacing\\" has the setup of a mystery novel, I feel obligated to say that anybody who reads it hoping for a conventional mystery will be disappointed.  The novel uses a psychologically incisive modernist prose style and the spectral image of the narrator's missing father, whose spirit haunts the beautiful scenery like an invisible entity, silent but somehow watching, to achieve an effect that is ultimately cerebral and ominous.  In the narrator's rather abrupt and almost maniacal transformation into a recluse, I was, oddly enough, reminded of Kafka's story \\"The Burrow,\\" which invokes a similar aura of paranoia; here the narrator is making a final effort to protect herself, now that she no longer can rely on her father's protection, from the harmful effects of the world.	2004-04-22
US	49396726	R2MLOSYN1VJE1N	0141439777	175734036	The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	262	272	N	N	Radical even in the 21st century	Composed long before there were rules about what a novel is supposed to look like, &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy&quot; is a visionary piece of literature, a book so original in construction it almost defies genre.  Conceived by an Anglican vicar who, under the comic influence of Rabelais and Swift and equally informed by Cervantes and Shakespeare, turned to writing fiction later in his life, it is an inadvertent masterpiece, the product of a writer who just wanted to have fun and entertain his readers and ultimately entertained generations. <br />The book is not a fictitious autobiography, although its narrator Tristram Shandy might have intended it to be; most of the story is concerned not with his life but with his idiosyncratic family and the circumstances surrounding his conception and birth, with many digressions on various related and unrelated subjects.  His father Walter, whose conjugal duties coincide with his having to wind the clock the first Sunday of every month, compiles a compendium of information he calls the Tristrapoedia for the education of his newborn son.  His uncle Toby, an expert in military architecture, rides a hobby-horse and occupies his time with the science of besieging fortresses.  Other characters include Corporal Trim, a former soldier and now Toby's valet and factotum; Dr. Slop, a dwarfish physician who delivers the baby Tristram; and Yorick the parson, who naturally is descended from the infamous jester of the Danish royal court.    <br />There are two aspects to this book that distinguish Sterne's style.  The first is that he provides several different channels of narration and never really settles on a main plot thread; he interrupts the flow of one narrative with another, delivering narrative flights of fancy like a marriage contract, a sermon, a notice of excommunication from the Catholic Church, a travelogue for France and Italy, and amusing anecdotes about extracurricular characters.  In this way he presages the modernism of many twentieth century authors.  <br />The second is that he does not restrict his text to English words; he intersperses Greek, Latin, and French passages where he likes, and on occasion he does not even use words at all, but symbols and glyphs to express certain concepts.  A cross appears in the print when a character crosses himself; a character's death is memorialized by a black page; a blank page is provided for the reader to draw (mentally or physically) his own vision of the voluptuous Widow Wadman, who has a romantic eye for Toby; long rows of asterisks and dashes are used for things that are better left unsaid.  At one point Sterne even draws squiggly lines to illustrate the sinuosity of his narrative, celebrating his own whimsy.    <br />&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; was published in nine volumes over the last nine years of Sterne's life, and whether these were all he had intended is debatable because the narrative is implied to have neither a beginning nor an end; it seems very much like a work in progress.  As such, by modern literary standards it may not be considered a novel, but in the sense of its unconventionality, its supply of so many bemusing surprises for the reader to discover, it is as literal an example of the term &quot;novel&quot; as there is.	2004-04-18

This is not to say that the novel isn't worth reading; as a seafaring adventure story, it is an excellent depiction of life and labor on a fishing boat and the dangers that face fishermen, spiced with a plethora of nautical jargon in salty dialects, but it doesn't have much beyond that, although for many readers that would be enough.  <br />To identify the principal hero of the novel is difficult because this is that rare kind of novel in which everybody is a hero.  Harvey Cheyne, the spoiled, insouciant fifteen-year-old son of an American multimillionaire, is on a luxury steamliner going to Europe when he falls overboard and is rescued from the waters by a fishing schooner called, appropriately, the \\"We're Here.\\"  The captain is a rusty old salt named Disko Troop who tells the boy that they won't be returning to shore for months and that he'd better work on the boat to earn his keep.  Harvey, who is not used to work, naturally protests at first but, sensing the futility of his resistance, quickly changes his attitude and puts his nose to the grindstone.  <br />The schooner's small crew is a tough but benign group of sailors who, despite thinking Harvey's story of being heir to a fabulous fortune is just the product of a vivid imagination, treat him as one of their own, teaching him the ropes and allowing him to participate in their camaraderie, while Troop's son Dan, who is about Harvey's age, becomes his closest confidant regarding the tricks of the trade.  Eventually the schooner returns to its home base at Gloucester, Massachussetts, where Harvey is able to contact his parents, at the reunion with whom his father realizes with pride that his son's experience on the schooner has given him a sense of responsibility and that he is now equipped better than ever to become a future business leader of America. <br />While \\"Captains Courageous\\" doesn't have the intrigue of Robert Louis Stevenson or the psychological depth of Melville's nautical masterpiece or even the lush, exotic textures and prodigious scope of Kipling's own later novel \\"Kim,\\" it maintains a strong narrative drive and has a pleasant simplicity.  The object lesson about the importance of self-discipline and the invigorating rewards of honest hard work may be a necessary accompaniment to the story, since there is never any concern that anything bad will happen to Harvey, but taken in the spirit of the adventure it feels like an integral part of the whole.	2004-04-07
US	49396726	R13TPPHRA4G5AN	0375701230	91189139	A Death in the Family	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A powerful elegy on the American family	While reading James Agee's posthumously published novel \\"A Death in the Family,\\" I realized that this unjustifiably overlooked writer is one of the more accomplished American prose stylists of the mid-twentieth century.  Apparently also a renowned film critic, journalist, and poet, Agee applies a technique that finds modes and moods associated with other famous Southern writers, showing shades of Faulkner's descriptive flair and Eudora Welty's sensitivity to emotions and domestic despair, without overdoing any single aspect of his style.<br />The story takes place in 1915 in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Jay Follet, an ordinary man approaching middle age, lives with his wife Mary and their two small children, Rufus, who is about six, and Catherine, who is almost four.  One night he gets an anxious telephone call from his brother Ralph beckoning him to the bedside of their ailing father, who appears to be at death's door.  Jay agrees to go, and in an excellent scene in which Mary makes breakfast for him before his departure, the reader gets a clear view of the kind of relationship they have.  The alarm turns out to be a false one, but death is still in the cards:  Returning home, Jay is killed in a car accident.<br />The rest of the novel demonstrates the sudden impact on Mary and her well-meaning family.  Her aunt Hannah is the most helpful and the most sympathetic to her piety; her father is an agnostic who takes a practical view of things while her partially deaf mother listens through an ear trumpet; her brother Andrew tries to console her by explaining the relatively merciful circumstances of Jay's death with an interesting forensic reconstruction of the accident.  Andrew is a cynic who seems to derive his personality from his father; he is quick to detect sanctimoniousness and sourly decries the priest who refuses to give the unbaptized Jay full burial rites.  And, in regard to a difficult telephone conversation with Jay's inarticulate brother, he delivers the novel's best line: \\"Talking to that fool is like trying to put socks on an octopus.\\" <br />The text of the novel is interspersed with sections relating the young Rufus's memories of growing up and perspective on his father's death, the seriousness and finality of which he is not quite old enough to understand.  There are nostalgic scenes depicting days and nights on the Knoxville streets, his expectations of a \\"surprise\\" which turns out to be the birth of his younger sister, an epiphanous lesson on race relations from his black nurse Victoria, the torment and ridicule he suffers from older, bigger boys when he starts school, and, most piquant of all, a Charlie Chaplin film to which his father takes him.    <br />Although religion plays a role, the novel is not filled with uplifting, hyperreligious cliches that try to find some higher purpose in the tragedy.  Agee explores trauma and grief with the hard eye of a playwright, rendering his novel warm but not sentimental, melancholy but not depressing or humorless, melodramatic but not hysterical.  \\"A Death in the Family\\" is as pure an elegy on the American family as any the previous century could conceive.	2004-04-05

Silas Lapham is not a ruthless, villainously greedy tycoon who bullies his employees and relishes destroying the careers of his competitors and enemies, but a conscientious, likeable man to whom misfortune happens because of his gullibility and sense of guilt rather than hubris.   <br />Lapham is a human emblem of the new American industrial economy of the 1870s.  A self-made millionaire in the paint business, he is now one of the richest men in Boston and is radiantly proud of the fact that he has earned every dollar.  Having grown up poor and undereducated in Vermont, he still speaks in a rustic vernacular and has yet to understand the rationale behind the rules of high society, let alone assimilate them.  A simple, practical man with a sense of duty, he even put aside his business to serve in the Civil War, in which he was seriously wounded and achieved the rank of colonel.  He can be boastful and garrulous, but he is not arrogant or overbearing. <br />Lapham is dearly devoted to his wife Persis, who in turn has supported him through thick and thin, and his two daughters.  Penelope, the older girl, is relatively plain but witty and sardonic and, at least in the first half of the novel, never seems to take anything seriously; her sister Irene is the more beautiful but vapid and superficial.  Irene falls for Tom Corey, the young man who comes to work for her father as a foreign sales representative, but Tom and Penelope have a mutual attraction that, Penelope fears, could break Irene's heart.  This romantic subplot allows Howells to contrast Tom's family, part of the old Boston aristocracy, with the even wealthier but socially crude Laphams with whose daughter Tom's mother has snobbish doubtsabout his possible union.<br />The novel has almost the air of Greek tragedy in that Lapham is a man of stature who has fatal flaws that threaten to destroy him.  He is a teetotaller, and when he does take the liberty of trying some wine at a dinner party, he embarrasses himself and his family by talking too much.  He abstains from gambling, but, instigated by his former business partner and current gadfly Milton Rogers, he gets into financial trouble when he stakes money on bad property and bad stocks.  And, to compensate for a traumatic event in his past, he is charitable almost to a fault to a pretty girl whom he employs as a typist in his office.<br />The style of &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is a dramatic realism similar to that found in the novels of Howells's contemporaries Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser; the structure is straightforward, and the dialogue cuts to the core in laying bare the characters' sentiments and unfolding the plot.  It may fall short of being a &quot;great&quot; novel, but for its candid portrayal of a specimen of the nouveau riche, it can be considered a minor monument of nineteenth century American literature.	2004-03-30

Proust can recall the torrid emotions of a teenage crush with the articulate language and clarity of an extremely intellectual adult with a literary voice so distinctive it practically exists in a genre of its own; and in &quot;Within a Budding Grove,&quot; the second volume of &quot;In Search of Lost Time,&quot; he subjects his narrator, now in his young teens, to the charms of two girls who will define for him a youthful ideal by which he standardizes love and beauty.<br />Searching for ideals seems to be the young Marcel's goal in life.  Whether he is enamored with the actress Berma at the theater, the writings of his literary model Bergotte, or the paintings of the artist Elstir, he immerses himself headlong into what he believes to be the supreme examples of artistic experience and absorbs the impressions so that he may reflect them in his own future writing.  Oddly enough, his feminine ideal is no girl of his own age but Odette, the courtesan who was the obsession of his parents' friend Swann in the previous volume and is now Swann's wife, and whose checkered past casts a lingering shadow over her husband's social status, excluding them from the higher strata of Paris society (the Faubourg Saint-Germain) and keeping Swann suspicious about her behavior with other men.  <br />Marcel is trying to develop a relationship with the Swanns' lovely, lively red-haired daughter Gilberte, and he agonizes over the fear that he will not succeed in impressing upon her parents that he is good enough for her.  It may seem strange that an adolescent Marcel should spend so much time talking about the Swanns, as though they were potential in-laws, rather than his own parents, but this is an indication of his preoccupying desire for Gilberte's company.  Finally he comes to the realization that she does not feel the same way about him as he does about her, which accompanies his bitter shock at seeing her with another boy.  Long after his passion for her has faded, however, he still treasures his memories of the time he has spent in Odette's salon.  <BR>  <BR>The second half of this volume concerns Marcel's summer sojourn with his grandmother in Balbec, a seaside resort.  There he meets his grandmother's friend Madame de Villeparisis, whose father spent the nineteenth century hobnobbing with all the great French writers of the era, and befriends her grandnephew Robert de Saint-Loup, a young man a little older than himself, who is embarking on a military career.  One day he notices a remarkably attractive girl walking a bicycle with a group of her friends; this turns out to be Albertine, with whom he forms a relationship that is more playful than the tense one he had with the frigid Gilberte but ends sourly with a refused kiss and a confused Marcel pondering her intentions.<br />Marcel's hypersensitive nature grants him many advantages as a narrator, giving him the ability to overanalyze every situation that shapes his consciousness, but arguably limits his lifestyle.  His parents coddle him about his health, even supposing an evening at the theater will debilitate him, and, as we see at Balbec, he accustoms himself to a new setting in an abnormally awkward manner.  But perhaps his awkwardness, in love as in life, can be explained partly by the nymphic philosophy by which Odette guides her life: &quot;You can do anything with men when they're in love with you, they're such idiots!&quot;  The truth hurts.	2004-03-27

The chapter summaries in the table of contents, and not the body of the novel itself, give evidence of a plot, which concerns the dream-consciousness of a man whose initials H.C.E. recur as an acronym at various points in the text and whose wife Anna Livia Plurabelle, sons Shem (the Penman) and Shaun (the Postman), and daughter Issy figure prominently among many other exotic and unexpected characters.  However, the presentation is so nebulous and abstract that the novel resembles nothing else in literature, although the style looks deceptively easy to imitate.<br />Upon first looking at the pages of &quot;Finnegans Wake,&quot; one inevitably must wonder what it's supposed to be.  My explanation of it is an extension of my theory about &quot;Ulysses,&quot; which is that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was Joyce's effort to write a novel that used every single existing word in the English language, or at least as many as he could.  (Among its 400,000 words, &quot;Ulysses&quot; certainly has a much broader lexicon than any other novel of comparable length.)  Having exhausted all the possibilities of English in &quot;Ulysses,&quot; he had only one recourse for his next project, which was to create an entirely new language as a pastiche of all the existing ones; the result is &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;<br />The language in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is a continuum of puns, portmanteaus, disfigured words, anagrams, and rare scraps of straightforward prose.  What Joyce does is exploit the way words look and sound in order to associate them with remote, unrelated ideas.  For example, his phrase &quot;Olives, beets, kimmells, dollies&quot; may sound familiar to those who happen to know that the first four letters of the Hebrew alphabet are aleph, bet, gimel, daled.  &quot;Psing a psalm of psexpeans, apocryphul of rhyme&quot; recalls a nursery rhyme that may reside quietly in your most dormant memory cells, while &quot;Where it is nobler in the main to supper than the boys and errors of outrager's virtue&quot; sounds like a drunk auditioning for the role of Hamlet.  Imaginary adjectives that pertain to letters of the English alphabet are employed to describe Dublin as a city &quot;with a deltic origin and a nuinous end.&quot;  &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is the ultimate in esoterica, and what you get out of it depends largely on your store of knowledge, so that upon completion, with a mutual wink at Joyce, you congratulate yourself for being so clever.<br />The text is supposed to reflect a dream or a dreamlike state, an imperfect rendering of hazily remembered pictures and thoughts, but it also evokes the multivocal babble one might hear in a crowded Irish pub, multiple rolling streams of lilting brogue-laden speech combining into a sort of rhythmic cacophony, a variegated procession of verbal images ranging from the mundane to the fantastical.  It cannot be read in any conventional manner of reading prose; each sentence has a melody, and the words must be vocalized in the mind to hear the verbal music.  It can be maddening if you try to make meaning of it all, but if you're familiar with Joyce's past work, you've already risked your sanity adequately to make it through &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot;ells, while &quot;Where it is nobler in the main to supper than the boys and errors of outrager's virtue&quot; sounds like a drunk auditioning for the role of Hamlet.

US	49396726	RL9SAIHVAJBO	0316926116	195949365	Vile Bodies	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Idiots and savants	The great thing about Evelyn Waugh is that the humor of his novels transcends their era.  You don't have to know anything about English society of the 1920s to be entertained by &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; because Waugh's style relies on fundamentally silly characters, wry dialogue, piercing intelligence, and manic energy more than on contemporary culture, events, and figures.  What makes his humor unique is that he can be irreverent without being tasteless, which seems an amazing concept since modern comedy has made the terms &quot;irreverent&quot; and &quot;tasteless&quot; practically synonymous.  Few novels can elicit from me at least one paroxysm of audible laughter, but &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; succeeds in this feat, as does most of Waugh's work.  <br />&quot;Vile Bodies,&quot; one his earlier novels, is prototypical of his career, featuring a protagonist who is beleaguered by misfortunes but manages to rise to certain challenges.  Adam Fenwyck-Symes is a young author who would like to marry his girlfriend Nina Blount but doesn't have enough money to support her, and he has to write twelve books before he can get a decent advance from his publisher.  For the time being, he rents a room at a boarding house run by a woman named Lottie Crump and inhabited by a disparate group of idiots including the deposed king of Ruritania.<br />Adam petitions Nina's father, a retired colonel who is either senile or eccentric or both, a wealthy man who's too cheap to buy a car or pay for bus fare but enthusiastic enough about the cinema to blow all his money on the production of a film about Methodism founder John Wesley, for some financial aid, but the old man's strings can't be pulled so easily.  A ray of hope is offered in the form of the suicide of a local rag gossip columnist named Simon Balcairn who assumes the nom de plume of Mr. Chatterbox.  Adam fills in for the deceased hack, documenting the antics of the partying crowd, nonchalantly embellishing and inventing items to makethe proceedings more interesting to his readers and himself.  <br />Waugh is brilliant in the way he constructs an episodic novel within the context of an overarching plot, each of his characters usually having one distinct idiosyncrasy that contributes something significant to the story.  One episode consists of a drunken Major who bets Adam's money on a sure horse but never makes it clear whether Adam will ever get his money back.  Another memorable scene is an automobile race attended by Adam and a few of his friends, including Agatha Runcible, a young lady who nearly immolates herself by carelessness with her discarded cigarettes.  And perhaps the most salient extraneous character is Mrs. Melrose Ape, an American evangelist who travels with a chorus of winged &quot;angels,&quot; each named after a Virtue.  (Chastity's persistent misconduct with strange men is troublesome to the troupe.)  Virtue or not, Discontent could never be as Divine as one of Waugh's novels.	2004-03-10
US	49396726	R2F6JQVA5HIOIP	0375708723	260999800	1876: A Novel	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Scandal on the centennial	In the afterword of &quot;1876,&quot; a novel about the centennial written in the bicentennial, Gore Vidal calls the portentous year &quot;probably the low point in our republic's history&quot; and warns us that history repeats itself in the most interesting ways.  This was the year of the presidential election in which Democratic candidate Samuel Tilden received the majority of the popular vote *and* the electoral vote -- but Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was &quot;elected&quot; and inaugurated.  This scandal was somewhat of a turning point in American history, for it set a deleterious precedent for the influence of partisan politics in directly altering the outcome of an election.<br />The details of the election are narrated by Charlie Schuyler, an American journalist who has been living in France as a diplomat for over three decades and has just returned to the United States with his widowed daughter Emma, a French princess.  Facing unemployment, he accepts jobs covering timely events like the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia for various periodicals including the New York Times, edited by his friend William Cullen Bryant, the country's most celebrated poet, and the New York Herald, a newspaper of lesser distinction, published by an impulsive young man named Jamie Bennett.  Meanwhile, Emma's status as part of the stock of European aristocracy permits her (and her father) entry into the upper echelons of New York society as she considers options for a new husband.<br />The country has changed considerably during Schuyler's absence; what was once a nation of farmers is now a nation of factories and railroads with money as the prime mover, driving and corrupting the current federal government under Grant's administration.  Schuyler passionately supports as candidate for president his friend Tilden -- the governor of New York, a wealthy, popular lawyer, and a sickly, dyspeptic man -- because of Tilden's ideas of reform and resistance of the will of rich men who would pass laws to protect their own fortunes while allowing them to steal from others.<br />There is plenty of calm before the storm with regard to the election.  James G. Blaine, Speaker of the House of Representatives, appears to be the front runner for the Republican nominee up until the last minute at the Republican Convention when Hayes, the little-known governor of Ohio and Civil War general, comes out of nowhere to sweep the ballots.  As November and December pass into 1877, the assessment of the results of the presidential election is prolonged as several states are disputed even though Tilden's victory is evident.  The country is brought to the brink of a new civil war (in Schuyler's estimation), or at least a military coup d'etat, when Grant dispatches federal troops to various locations in the South to prevent riots and rebellion by protesting Democrats.  <br />&quot;1876&quot; is as much a polemic as a novel; Vidal is never ambiguous about his opinions on what he believes to be debacles in the American political arena, and his tone, delivered here through the voice of Schuyler, is clear as a bell and sharp as a tack.  Schuyler is an ideal narrator for a historical novel -- cynical, smug, a little vain and conceited, but disdainful of greed and very serious about the nation's political ethos.  In this sense, it is odd that he does not like the work of Mark Twain, whom he happens to meet in one memorable exchange; but when your literary taste is more for Flaubert, Twain can be a tough nut to crack.	2004-03-07
US	49396726	R3P8IM728SAGQ5	0141439831	463707544	Vanity Fair (Penguin Classics)	Books	3	31	44	N	N	Has not aged gracefully	The reputation of Thackeray's &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; perseveres to this day, but I'm not sure it demands to be read in preference to many of its contemporaneous peers.  In the twenty-first century it simply fails to entertain on the level it was intended when it was written in the 1840s, and even its literary value is dubious.  The novel asks rhetorically why we are never satisfied with the things we achieve in life, and the question reverberates in a canyon of echoes as Thackeray repetitively beats the theme to death with a story that is too long and too dull.  Of course it satirizes the hypocrisy, materialism, and frivolity in the higher strata of English society, but it hardly excels in this regard when compared to so many other novels, particularly Dickens's, of the same era that do likewise with more subtlety and intelligence.  If &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; can be considered a socially valuable novel merely because it satirizes society, then nearly any novel can be considered socially valuable.      <br />Set in the 1810s and 1820s, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is basically the tale of two young women, Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp, making their respective ways through English society after leaving school.  Amelia, a virtuous girl from an affluent family, marries George Osborne, the son of a man with whom her father has a financial quarrel.  Becky, a beautiful, vivacious girl from an artistic but broken family, takes a job as a governess for a repulsive old man named Sir Pitt Crawley and eventually marries his son Rawdon.  Both husbands are British military officers who fight under the Duke of Wellington against Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo; only one comes home alive.  The novel then becomes a study in reversal, followed by a sort of restoration, of fortune -- Becky uses her charm to climb the ladder of high society while Amelia struggles to support herself and her young son.  <br />My biggest problem with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is Thackeray's general style.  His prose is serviceable but unrefined; he has a poor sense for the arrangement of detail, constructing lopsided paragraphs and dispensing useless information like complimentary mints at the door of a restaurant.  His serious characters fail to invoke sympathy and his few comical characters fail to amuse.  Perhaps it was his intention to avoid caricatures, but he can't fairly be called a realist either.  Additionally he chooses to write with the voice of a narrator whose tone is gossipy bordering on the obnoxious.  Occasionally he does offer a psychological or social insight that is interesting if not profound, but these moments seem more like digressive interjections than integral parts of the story.  <br />I know I'm being picky with this novel, but I expected better considering its permanent status in the English literary canon.  As a Victorian novelist, Thackeray cannot compete with Eliot, Hardy, Dickens, the Brontes, or even Wilkie Collins or Samuel Butler; rather, he unfortunately seems to be on the same level as Anthony Trollope, whose voluminous chronicles of the straight-laced middle class are written well but leave a bland aftertaste.  Despite its purport to be something more, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is merely a genteel, fluffy, uneventful soap opera penned by an author who attempts to be wry but instead compels his reader to wade through a Slough of Despond.	2004-03-04
US	49396726	RE7O9WMH6T09K	0451526090	476403833	Death in Venice and Other Stories (Signet Classics)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Art as a way of life	This collection of Thomas Mann's novellas and short stories thematically exhibits the alienation of being a passionate artist in a bourgeois society.  &quot;We artists despise no one more than the dilettante, the man of life who thinks that in his spare time, on top of everything else, he can become an artist,&quot; the title character tells a sympathetic friend in &quot;Tonio Kroger,&quot; a story which seems at least partially autobiographical.  Tonio, who has become a renowned writer as an adult, recalls an instance when he was a boy in which he tried to entice the interest of a friend -- a popular, athletic boy, everything that Tonio was not -- by enthusiastically explaining to him the plot of Schiller's &quot;Don Carlos.&quot;  The attempt was futile, however, and Tonio was left spiritually alone with his unusual love of literature.<br />&quot;Tristan&quot; takes the artist-bourgeois conflict to a setting that presages Mann's definitive novel &quot;The Magic Mountain.&quot;  The protagonist, an offbeat writer named Spinell confined to a tuberculosis sanatarium, takes an interest in a fellow patient, a businessman's wife who, he discovers, is a sensitive and tasteful amateur pianist.  He writes her husband a derogatory letter, deploring him as a philistine who does not deserve to share his life with this secretly artistic woman, which results in a heated confrontation between the two men.  In &quot;The Child Prodigy,&quot; Mann's tone turns satirical as he focuses on an eight-year-old concert pianist giving an electrifying public performance to an audience whose various reactions -- wonder, jealousy, indifference -- are reflections upon themselves more so than on the performer.  <br />&quot;Death in Venice&quot; is the boldest piece in this collection, unambiguously presenting homosexuality in an artistically positive light but also showing something of a German fascination with Italian culture and scenery.  Gustav Aschenbach, the protagonist, again seems to reflect Mann to an extent as a middle-aged, widowed, respected author from Munich who becomes infatuated with a teenage boy while vacationing in Venice.  Whether this love ever becomes mutual or physical is not as important as the mood Mann invokes about European cultural and moral decadence, possibly symbolized by the cholera epidemic that sweeps through the city.  <br />&quot;Man and Dog: An Idyll&quot; is a brilliant meditation on the narrator's affectionate and occasionally difficult relationship with his pet pointer and also allows a glimpse of life in the industrialized and suburbanized Germany of the early twentieth century.  To say that Mann gives the dog a human personality may seem a cliche, but few writers could achieve his level of empathy in relating a dog's behavior and desires in man's terms without resorting to outright personification.   A disturbing inversion of this story is told in &quot;Tobias Mindernickel,&quot; in which a lonely old man, given no personal background by Mann, ostracized in his neighborhood by adults and taunted by children, buys a dog and demands from it the obedience and respect he has never earned from people.<br />Mann is truly one of the most important figures in twentieth century literature.  What he chose to portray, and the talent with which he portrayed it, brighten the legacy of a century that threatened to destroy art in so many ways for so many insane reasons.	2004-02-20
US	49396726	R273FU6HK900CJ	0140434275	586945850	Daniel Deronda	Books	5	92	95	N	N	Another monument to Eliot's brilliance	&quot;Daniel Deronda,&quot; the culmination of George Eliot's distinguished career, is a tale of two cultures which explores the themes of concealed heritage, bigotry, and marriages of convenience in a manner never done before or since.  Like its predecessor &quot;Middlemarch,&quot; it is a long novel of perfectly structured complexity and impressive intellectual exposition, built upon a cast of characters so sharply and meticulously defined that the plot is propelled solely by the power of their presence.  This is the novel that Henry James wanted to write, and even he could never match Eliot's passion and linguistic effortlessness.   <br />The forward story in &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; is that of Gwendolen Harleth, a coquettish, conceited, superficial girl  -- in company she often affects a sophistication that is never quite convincing -- who could be called the heroine even though she lacks most heroic attributes.  She is from an upper class family, but when misfortune strikes and she is faced with poverty, she consents to marry a man named Mallinger Grandcourt, heir to a large estate, rather than reduce herself to taking a job as a governess, and despite having received a warning from a mysterious lady about Grandcourt's having fathered illegitimate children.  <br />The secondary story is that of Daniel Deronda, the title character, a young man who first sees Gwendolen in a casino in Leubronn at the beginning of the novel.  Daniel, who happens to be the ward of Mallinger Grandcourt's uncle, Sir Hugo Mallinger, is inquisitive about his obscure parentage and unsure of his place in the world.  One portentous day, he rescues a girl from drowning herself -- this is Mirah Lapidoth, a Jewish girl who has run away from her father in Prague and come to London to look for her long-lost mother and brother.  Daniel decides to help her by playing detective, which eventually leads him to befriend a family of Jewish shopkeepers named Cohen, whom he supposes to be related to Mirah, and a deeply religious man named Mordecai.    <br />Eliot intertwines this Judaic element with that of Gwendolen's unhappy marriage, as Daniel maintains a steady companionship with her while he spends time immersing himself in Jewish culture, learning about a past he never knew he had.  The event by which Gwendolen's situation resolves itself is foreshadowed by a particularly eerie symbol:  In her family's house, there is a painting she dreads, apparently conceived by a morbid ancestor, depicting a figure running away in fright from an upturned dead face.  As a plot device it may seem unrealistically gothic, but Eliot's treatment of her material is too somber and mature ever to succumb to the absurd.<br />This novel, while not as consistently great as &quot;Middlemarch,&quot; confirms my opinion that Eliot is the most accomplished, intelligent, and original of the Victorian novelists, boldly ahead of her time.  She is undeniably one of the greatest psychological portraitists in literature; better than most other authors, she understands the way people think and why they do what they do, which is probably why her sense of tragedy feels authentic rather than merely sentimental.  Whether &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; is read to get a unique insight on Jewish life in London in the nineteenth century or just to bask in the opulence of Eliot's prose, the effort will be richly rewarded.	2004-02-12
US	49396726	RJXRQ6MNBS1EE	0684804522	553808911	The Garden of Eden	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Mediterranean menage a trois	In this posthumous Hemingway novel, David Bourne, a talented young author who has just published his second novel to much acclaim, is on an extended honeymoon with his bride Catherine traveling throughout various hot spots on the Mediterranean.  They're American, of course, and to Hemingway the best way to be American is to spend as much time as possible in Europe.  As the title implies, the setting of David and Catherine's romantic idyll is nothing short of paradise, a splendor of leisure, food, and drink -- and there is indeed a lot of drinking.<br />One day Catherine returns to the hotel where she and David are staying with her hair cut short as a boy's; this simple but suggestive act precipitates a flurry of homoerotic innuendoes that pervade the remainder of the novel.  At Cannes they meet a beautiful European girl named Marita who is attracted -- sexually -- to both of them, as they are to her.  She becomes their traveling companion and, with everybody's consent, makes love to Catherine and then to David, but not, I'm afraid, at the same time.  If this menage a trois is supposed to represent the Fall, with Marita playing the role of the Serpent, it seems that Paradise is not yet lost.<br />As a writer, David (like his creator) lets his life become his work, and he is currently inspired to write a story about elephant hunting with his father in Africa, a reminiscence of a transformative boyhood event.  Catherine, an idle and apparently rich girl with no professional aspirations of her own except to char herself to a crisp getting the darkest tan she can, is jealous of his work and the authorial attention he gets; Marita, also rich (Catherine frequently calls her Heiress), is more sympathetic to David's intense artistic nature.  He is clearly too narcissistic to be in love with anybody but himself and his own work, and being married to him means having to accept that, which may be too much of a sacrifice for Catherine to make. <br />Hemingway's trademark is thathe makes his characters so complex precisely by having them say so little.  The dialogue here is laconic and breezy, as though verbosity would be tedious in a place of such beauty and with people so blithe and lax.  The easy, free flow of the narrative, giving the impression of having been written on autopilot, belies the fact that Hemingway spent the last fifteen years of his life working on this novel sporadically, evidently putting a tremendous amount of consideration into the statement he wanted to make.  Like most of his statements, it bears his unmistakable stamp of restlessness and of impatience with the normal course of the world.	2004-02-09

Coetzee's &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; would seem like a political dystopia if it weren't so similar, if not identical, to many real situations in world history up to today.  The premise is that a relatively new civilization of settlers have colonized a land formerly inhabited by natives, whom they call barbarians, and have established garrisons and strongholds to protect themselves from imagined attacks by the barbarians.  The settlers constitute a political entity which is referred to as the Empire, the implication being that they want and need to expand their borders continually to allow their civilization to thrive, pushing the barbarians further back into the hinterlands.  <br />It certainly sounds realistic, but the novel has the edge of science fiction.  It seems to be set in a fantasy world, since there is no indication of time or place with respect to real history and geography, except that the era seems no more modern than Victorian.  Contributing to the novel's grimly impersonal tone is the fact that most of the characters are unnamed except for Joll and Mandel, two military officers who exemplify the Empire's hawkish stance.  By contrast, the first-person narrator, a magistrate and reluctantly loyal servant of the Empire, possesses the novel's humanist conscience in that he secretly sympathizes with the barbarians, condemning the unnecessary brutality of the soldiers who raid the lands and seize barbarian prisoners.  <br />Like the archetypal rebels in the dystopian novels &quot;Brave New World,&quot; &quot;Darkness at Noon,&quot; and &quot;1984,&quot; the narrator is a symbol of nonconformist thought and action in the face of an oppressive political regime.  Consequently, he is accused by his superiors of consorting with the enemy -- he had been sheltering (and seducing) a barbarian girl who had been captured and beaten by the Imperial soldiers -- and is punished.  But the conflicts he experiences are internal as much as external; he is a firm pacifist but cannot imagine any other way to live than under the comfort and protection of the bellicose Empire.<br />Whether or not the novel is supposed to be allegorical, it doesn't have the tone of a political diatribe.  It is as compassionate and as insightful as its narrator, understanding people's need for security, land, and freedom, carefully measuring different perspectives on imperial war.  (Explaining his dovish opinion to a soldier, the narrator is conscious of his apparent weakness as a potential defender of the Empire.)  Perhaps the novel merely intends to present an extreme scenario in which a mentality of tribalism has completely usurped humanity:  Will a complex system of walls and gates continue to divide society, in the name of empire or other agenda, until we are huddling behind parapets, waiting for &quot;barbarians&quot; who may never come, who may not even exist outside of our imaginations?	2004-02-05

A little Sherlock Holmes goes a long way, but \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" Doyle's only full-length (although short) novel featuring the sleuth, flows at a nice pace that proportions it well with the shorter stories.<br />The case involves the legend of a monstrous hound that haunts the moor around Baskerville Hall, the ancestral manor of the nearly defunct Baskerville line.  Sir Henry Baskerville has just returned to England from Canada to inherit the estate left by his uncle Sir Charles who recently died under mysterious circumstances that appear to be related to the hound.  In London, Sir Henry has received an anonymous note warning him to stay away from the moor, someone has been shadowing him, and, even more portentously, two boots have been stolen from his hotel room -- not a pair, but one boot from each of two pairs.<br />Immediately hired to solve the puzzle, Holmes dispatches his loyal colleague, Dr. Watson, to Baskerville Hall to collect clues.  Watson meets several interesting residents in the vicinity, such as Stapleton, a wispy entomologist living in a house with his sister whose beauty attracts Sir Henry's amorous attentions, and Frankland, an ebulliently litigious old man with a telescope and a troubled daughter.  Among the servants of Baskerville Hall, the most prominent is Barrymore the butler who, for the sake of his wife, is harboring an incriminating secret about someone or something lurking on the moor.<br />Doyle is quite effective at evoking the bleakness of the moor, the slipping and drowning hazards of its slopes and bogs, and the chilling reverberations of the ghostly nocturnal canine howl across the open spaces.  The dark aura of the setting is magnified by the folkloric evil of Hugo Baskerville, the ancestor whose sins are purported to have brought the curse of the hound upon his descendants.  Holmes, of course, is no believer in superstitions; he puts his faith in physical logic and meticulously analyzes every detail observable to nobody but himself until an answer suggests itself.  Watson, as the emotional, compassionate half of the duo, complements the stoic Holmes; his main function is not to be a detective but to tell the story, which is fine because Holmes himself would probably be an insufferably mechanical narrator.the folkloric evil of Hugo Baskerville, the ancestor whose sins are purported to have brought the curse of the hound upon his descendants.

US	49396726	R8PPJ3AOOWN99	087951681X	921362677	A Glastonbury Romance	Books	5	47	50	N	N	Microcosmic epic of the ancient and the modern	Several attributes distinguish John Cowper Powys as a novelist, and the most prominent, as displayed by \\"A Glastonbury Romance,\\" is his penchant for long, dense, erudite novels; he is fascinated with mythology and likes to instill his essentially mundane settings with the fantasy and mystique of ages long past; and he tends to be profoundly philosophical in regard to the First Cause.  This \\"Romance\\" is not a typical heroic epic; the characters are common people who live in the town of Glastonbury, in Somerset County, England, but, like Thomas Hardy's aesthetic successor, Powys creates with his townspeople a vivid microcosm, imitating their peculiar dialect and manners with formidable accuracy. <br />Structurally, \\"A Glastonbury Romance\\" is in the nineteenth-century English tradition of long, labyrinthine novels of the kind composed by Dickens and Eliot, containing dozens of characters and several concurrent plot threads, but it is updated to the early twentieth century with contemporary political and sexual issues.  Most of the action centers on a family called Crow who, at the beginning of the novel, have convened in Glastonbury for the funeral of, and to hear the will of, their recently deceased patriarch William.  The most successful of William's grandsons is Philip Crow, an industrialist who owns a dye factory and a cave complex called Wookey Hole through which flows an underground river and from which tin is mined.  <br />The novel's conflicts are political, romantic, and spiritual on a grand scale.  The town's capitalism represented by Philip Crow is challenged by a small group of communists, led by the idealistic Dave Spear and a local churl named Red Robinson, who want to gain political control of Glastonbury and turn it into a worker-governed commune.  \\"Bloody Johnny\\" Geard, William Crow's former secretary, is elected Mayor through the support of the communists and becomes Philip's nemesis; although in the novel's concluding flood, a passage of enormous lyrical power and intense drama, the two men agree in a climactic scene on a surprisingly chivalrous course of action that reveals they are more heroic than their personalities originally suggested.  <br />This modern story is immersed in the aura of ancient legends -- Welsh, Celtic, and Biblical, from King Arthur to the Holy Grail to Stonehenge, mystical ingredients in Powys's pungent narrative stew.  Perhaps reflecting Powys himself is a Welsh Arthurian antiquary named Owen Evans who has devoted his life to the study of local lore and is writing a history of Merlin the magician.  Despite his enthusiastic attentions to the mysteries of the past, Powys is not as much of a misoneist here as he was in \\"Wolf Solent\\"; he ungrudgingly allows airplanes in his novel, granting us a brief but wonderful bird's-eye view of Somersetshire.<br />Although Powys's weighty style greatly appeals to me, this novel is not something I'd casually recommend to just anybody because it does require a considerable investment of the reader's time and concentration, being nearly as long as \\"War and Peace\\" and featuring verbose prose that pushes itself to, and often over, the limit.  But readers who like to indulge themselves in the colorful and expansive potential of the English language will find \\"A Glastonbury Romance\\" a most enriching experience.	2004-01-05
US	49396726	R34CGL2QHFABVR	015670160X	674405937	Orlando: A Biography	Books	5	88	89	N	N	A gender-bending saga of three centuries	\\"Orlando\\" is a fictional biography whose subject in the beginning is a sixteen-year-old boy in the Elizabethan era and in the end -- three hundred years later -- is a thirty-six-year-old woman.  This is not a novel about transsexuality, as such a premise would indicate, but it is a statement about sexual identity and gender roles in English society as only an author like Virginia Woolf could make, territory not even the brazen D.H. Lawrence could traverse with much confidence.  It is a lyrical tour de force in which Woolf displays her considerable talent for subtly describing moods and scenery, but most surprisingly, it demonstrates her sly sense of humor and satire.  <br />Orlando's gender alteration is naturally the central event of his preternaturally long life, but his aging only twenty years over a course of three centuries is certainly no less bizarre.  To describe the circumstances under which he becomes a woman or explain the logic by which he ages so slowly would be giving away too much in this review, nor would it really help to recommend the novel to one who is not yet persuaded to read it, so I will be silent on that account, saying only that these outrageous devices fully succeed as vehicles to explore Woolf's theme of femininity with respect to English cultural and historical frames of reference.<br />The novel examines the effect of gender alteration on Orlando's amorous and professional capacities.  As a young nobleman in the Elizabethan court whose interests are swordsmanship and poetry, he is engaged to an aristocratic Irish girl, has a torrid affair with a Russian princess, and meets a silly woman who, resembling nothing so much as a hare, calls herself the Archduchess Harriet.  After serving as an ambassador in Turkey, Orlando becomes a woman, joins a band of gypsies, and returns to England where he (she) must handle the legalities regarding his dukeship because of his new gender.  As a woman, he manages to gain the romantic attentions of famouswriters like Pope, Dryden, and Swift before eventually marrying and having a son.  Some surprises ensue, but let it suffice to say that Orlando is not the only androgynous character in the novel.<br />An underlying, and highly controversial, implication is that every human being harbors aspects of both genders, mainly psychological, but Woolf goes so far as to make them physical in order to press the point.  Although the idea may seem tame now, \\"Orlando\\" may have set a precedent for cross-gender role-playing when it was first published in 1928.  The novel is very much ahead of its time; it has a sort of nonchalant sophistication that characterizes the type of magical realism that was to become a large part of European-influenced literature throughout the rest of the twentieth century.  My admiration for Virginia Woolf only increases with each novel of hers that I read, and \\"Orlando\\" is in my opinion the best yet.	2003-12-29
US	49396726	RPIJK4S1PZWAW	0375422331	168525794	Isaac Newton	Books	5	3	5	N	N	&quot;Voyaging through strange seas of Thought&quot;	This is a concise but comprehensive biography of Isaac Newton by James Gleick, a scientific writer with an extraordinarily lucid narrative prose style.  Drawing from the most recent acquisitions of Newton's formerly scattered manuscripts at the Cambridge University libraries, Gleick has produced a valuable updated chronicle of the life of the man to whom so much of modern science owes its greatest debt.  Over fifteen relatively short chapters, he reconstructs the germination of Newton's ideas and explains the personal dramas they engendered and which became a large part of his reputation.<br />Newton may have been being insincerely humble when he said that &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; enabled him to see farther than others.  His concepts about gravity, light, and motion, although influenced by the work of his forebears, were entirely original, as he himself would be the first to insist.  Taking his method of inquiry from Aristotle, Newton was primarily an experimental scientist who would put no faith in a hypothesis that could not be tested.  Reclusive, secretive, celibate, but undeniably brilliant, he turned his room at Trinity College at Cambridge into a laboratory and an inner sanctum where he would think, experiment, and write, all for his own information.  His search for a mathematical technique to describe physical phenomena in terms of infinitesimal elements led to the development of calculus, a shotgun wedding of Galileo's theories of motion and Descartes's analytical geometry.<br />His adult life essentially had two distinct eras: first, as a student, scientist, and professor at Trinity College; and second, as a public figure serving as Warden and then Master of the royal Mint, a position which proved him ruthless in enforcing the death penalty for counterfeiters.  He befriended many men of stature, among them Samuel Pepys and John Locke, but he made enemies of many more:  He hotly debated the eminent Robert Hooke, Secretary of the RoyalSociety of London, over the nature of light; he tried to expropriate observatory data from John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal; and he conducted a furious epistolary battle with Gottfried Leibniz over proper credit for the invention of calculus.  (Leibniz, working independently, advantageously devised a more useful notation and published his accomplishments before Newton did.) <br />Gleick uncovers aspects of Newton's life that are not usually emphasized, such as his interest in alchemy, the pseudo-science of making gold out of baser metals, which at the time was still a popular pursuit among the learned.  Newton was also an avid student of scripture; he rejected Trinitarianism, which was a risky religious stance for a professor at Trinity College.  A century after his death he even acquired a strange legendary status among the Romantic poets Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth (quoted in the title of my review), and Blake, who regarded him with a sort of dreadful awe as a man who dared to solve the mysteries of nature with cold rationality.  The work of no other scientist has been able to touch so many different levels of culture as Newton's has, and that, perhaps, is Gleick's theme.	2003-12-22
US	49396726	R3LAH8ABD1716O	0486272753	882700843	Spoon River Anthology (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	If the dead could talk	Edgar Lee Masters's &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; is a poem in long form comprising over two hundred free-verse sketches, each representing and narrated by a deceased resident of a fictional town located on the Spoon River in western Illinois.  The dead talk not so much about their town as they do about themselves and the pivotal events that either transformed their lives or caused their deaths.  Like Sherwood Anderson's &quot;Winesburg, Ohio,&quot; the book exposes the depression, restlessness, and corruption that lurk behind the facade of small-town middle American sanctity with an almost constant focus on death that makes it even more grim.  If you're looking for something cheerful to read, you might want to pass on this.<br />&quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; has perhaps the highest character-to-page ratio of any work in literature.  Many of the narratives are interrelated in the sense that different people involved in a particular situation present their respective arguments which may be defensive apologies or rationalizations or vindictive taunts.  The names of the characters are often indicative of their personalities; appellations like Isaiah Beethoven, Voltaire Johnson, and Percy Bysshe Shelley show that Spoon River is hardly a haven for subtlety.  <br />The most commonly mentioned character is the wealthy Thomas Rhodes, the failure of whose bank had caused financial ruin to many of the town's residents, although we learn later that the culpability rests with his son Ralph's bad loans and speculations.  George Reece, the innocent cashier, took the rap and was sent to prison; his wife in her narrative advises the reader of her epitaph to &quot;memorize some bit of verse of truth or beauty.&quot;  She did so herself, taking a line from Alexander Pope, which enabled her to raise her children &quot;clean and strong&quot; in the face of hardship.<br />In Spoon River, lives of quiet desperation result in a cemetery of yapping corpses, lamenting wasted youth and lost chances.  Margaret Fuller Slack tells us that she aspired to be a novelist &quot;as great as George Eliot&quot; but marriage and motherhood cost her all of her time; her death from lockjaw is &quot;ironical&quot; because presumably she had so much to say.  Searcy Foote confesses remorselessly that he murdered his invalid aunt for money and personal freedom.  Zilpha Marsh, the ouija-board reader, was regarded as a fool when she would report to the townspeople that she had made contact with the spirit of a notorious figure from the past; the present tense of her narrative suggests that she is unaware that now she, too, is merely in the past. <br />Every single narrative in this fantastic collection is worthy of commentary; to mention just a few risks a skewed impression of the whole because the &quot;Anthology&quot; really must be read in its entirety to grasp its context.  However, there is one more feature which must be noted:  The &quot;Anthology&quot; ends with a fragment of an epic poem by Jonathan Swift Somers, one of the deceased.  Apparently it is a parody of the Iliad, and naturally it is called the Spooniad, drawing a parallel between the fall of Troy and that of Rhodes's bank.  Somers did not live to complete this ambitious project, which is just as well since in Spoon River death affords a distinction few living poets can hope to attain.	2003-12-15
US	49396726	R1GVPYCFCM3CY3	0374528012	673004245	Cheri and the Last of Cheri	Books	4	33	36	N	N	The boy who couldn't grow up	These two short novels by the French writer Colette cover a territory with which I have to admit to being completely unfamiliar, that of a young man's romantic education by a much older &quot;kept&quot; woman -- a lifestyle I assume to be uniquely French.  &quot;Cheri&quot; is the nickname of the man in question (real name: Fred), and his protectress and instructress in the arts of Eros is named Lea, who, an implied courtesan like his mother Madame Peloux, is kept wealthy by one or more benefactors.  Having grown up fatherless and free from discipline, Cheri is immature and spoiled, self-assured that he will be amply supported by his good looks and the middle-aged women who dote on him.  <br />At twenty-five, after living with Lea for several years, Cheri decides to marry a rich, younger girl named Edmee, and Lea understands that the time has come to let him go.  Their separation is not as easy as that, however; the bottom line is that he truly loves Lea, more so than he does Edmee.  With Lea he has developed a special relationship that somewhat perversely combines aspects of mother-son, boyfriend-girlfriend, and teacher-pupil.  His greatest chagrin is the realization that he was even naive enough to assume that he was Lea's first and only lover, never conjecturing the sources of her income.  <br />Colette's apparent purpose in these novels is to display a dramatic transformation of character.  At nineteen, Cheri is a joyful and frivolous youth; at thirty, a discontented and disillusioned man suffering from an idle lifestyle and a loveless marriage.  He is unable to relate to his wife Edmee, who does charity work for a hospital and hobnobs with various public figures -- selfless gestures that are alien to his personality.  His involvement in World War I has given him another hard lesson in maturity, and now he is lost in the new post-war society, a world that has no use for a thirty-year-old man who acts like a child and is hopelessly in love with a woman old enoughto be his mother.  <br />It seems to me that Colette's literary value lies in her skill at depicting early twentieth century bourgeois France in a clear, conversational style that is more accessible than the impressionistic difficulties of Proust and Gide.  In my estimate, her closest contemporary English counterpart would be Somerset Maugham; both writers manage to extract colorful but realistic drama out of the lives of ordinary people using straightforward but intelligent and sensitive prose that often evokes a certain elegance of setting, but Colette's characterization and attitude are distinctly French.  Her American counterpart would be more difficult to identify.	2003-12-09
US	49396726	R25XFJMFG6X5OA	0140153195	396357930	Justine (Alexandria Quartet)	Books	5	10	13	N	N	Adrift in Alexandria	The British novelist Lawrence Durrell seeks to make a stylistic first impression.  &quot;Justine,&quot; the first volume of his &quot;Alexandria&quot; quartet of novels, exhibits his technique as an almost continuous stream of metaphorical associations as conjured by a writer imaginative with adjectives and in rapturous love with his exotic setting.  Comparisons with other world-traveling literary modernists like Henry Miller and Paul Bowles are appropriate, but Durrell is more coherent than the former and more poetic than the latter, ultimately finding an unexplored niche somewhere between the two.<br />Set entirely in the historically and culturally rich coastal Egyptian city in the years preceding World War II, the novel is narrated by an unnamed Irish schoolteacher who keeps company with a colorful array of friends and lovers.  The plot is a classic love triangle in which the narrator is having an affair with Justine, the voluptuous wife of his friend Nessim, a wealthy Copt.  However, the novel is not as erotic as it could be given this premise; Durrell is much more interested in decorating the personalities of his characters to reveal their desires, fears, and motivations, allowing the characters to massage the plot rather than vice versa.  For example, it is with a great amount of narrative preparation that Durrell springs a crucial scene in which one of the main characters, a Greek woman named Melissa who works as a dancer at a night club, approaches Nessim with the news that his wife is being unfaithful to him.<br />The novel has two levels of intrigue.  One is that Justine is a woman of dire secrets, searching the city's houses of child prostitution for something dear she has lost and hiding the true nature of her relationship with a rich, lecherous ogre named Capodistria.  The second is that of a conspicuous local doctor named Balthazar, one of the narrator's close friends, whose interests are pederasty and the Cabbalah and who is being investigated by anaged Secret Service officer named Scobie assigned to uncover avenues of espionage in Alexandria.  Uniting these two threads is an independent, mercurial woman named Clea, friend to both Justine and Scobie, who is not so much introduced as a character as she is suffused throughout the story like a perfume to be sniffed here and there.<br />With an obviously intimate knowledge of Alexandria, Durrell describes the city and its surroundings in stunning detail that avoids the rigid tone of a travel guide, capturing the natural diversity of its population represented by his selection of characters.  A cosmopolitan mixture of sophistication and squalor seemingly modeled on Miller's Paris, his Alexandria is virtually an original literary milieu, replete with possibilities for the expanse of British expatriate fiction.	2003-12-08
US	49396726	R3JKNS358MFMZ3	0375752331	166079745	In Search of Lost Time, Vol. III: The Guermantes Way (v. 3)	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Paris society under a microscope	In &quot;The Guermantes Way,&quot; the third volume of &quot;In Search of Lost Time,&quot; Proust's nameless narrator has reached his teenage years and continues to observe the world around him as inspiration for his planned career in literature.  His family's relocation to a new apartment building in Paris, the Hotel de Guermantes, affords him the opportunity to acquaint himself with the Faubourg Saint-Germain and what he imagines to be the fashionable, intellectual side of the city's society, personified by the Duke and Duchess de Guermantes.  <br />The narrator's fascination with the Duchess could be described as an infatuation far surpassing that he used to have of Gilberte, the daughter of his parents' friend Charles Swann.  Sickly and meek, he has trouble making a positive impression on the Duchess in his chance encounters with her, but he is persistent.  He happens to have befriended her nephew Robert de Saint-Loup, a young military officer, from whom he politely requests a proper introduction by claiming a common interest in the work of a painter named Elstir.  Through Robert's help, the young narrator gains admission to the high society of his dreams, which gradually destruct into the apprehension that the rich can be frivolous and boring.<br />As Balzac's interest was in the depiction of Paris society as a &quot;human comedy&quot; in all its colors and movements, Proust's palette is much more subtle and sensitive but no less broad, taking prose about as far as it can go in the description of the intimacy of all the various complex emotions.  Cruelty, for example, is a simple subject, but Proust's portrayal of the nasty trick that Robert's girlfriend Rachel, a full-time actress and part-time prostitute, plays on one of her rivals, allows the narrator an inconceivably deep meditation on the ugliness of conceit.  Similarly, the narrator's unreasonably lengthy account of his grandmother's stroke and subsequent death is actually a brilliant exposition on the agony of mortality.   <BR> <BR>The events of &quot;The Guermantes Way&quot; play against the backdrop of the Dreyfus affair, and Proust remarkably demonstrates the heavy impact this incident had on the society of the day, bringing to the surface the particular virulence of French anti-semitism, usually latent, occasionally blatant.  Society is divided between pro-Dreyfus and anti-Dreyfus factions, Proust's sympathetic narrator being of the former but, like most &quot;Dreyfusards,&quot; not too vocal about the matter.  Proust uses a Jewish character, a rising dramatist named Bloch, as a token of the conflict, exhibiting him as an object of a peculiar French attitude that is less racial hatred than exotic curiosity. <br />Swann, himself of Jewish heritage, makes an appearance towards the end of the volume to remind the reader of his long relationship with the humble narrator.  Roughly I detect an analogy, not easily sustained by the evidence presented in this review but palpable in the text nonetheless, of their friendship with that of James Joyce's Leopold Bloom, also a Jew in a hostile environment, and Stephen Dedalus.  What Proust and Joyce really have in common, though, is their ability to forge bold new forms of literature that explore aspects of life never before exposed on the printed page.	2003-12-02
US	49396726	RD0L2G36BFJI0	0684842971	177682081	Varieties of Religious Experience	Books	5	9	12	N	N	The religious temperament	William James's &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; is about the psychology of religion, two subjects which under normal circumstances hardly interest me, but its appeal for readers who have no interest in the psychology of religion is literary rather than scholarly.  Transcribed from a series of lectures, James's book investigates man's need for religion -- the stimuli, besides institutional or parental influences, that compel a person to be truly religious, to have a deep spiritual communication with a higher power that surpasses in significance the mindless attendance of prayer services and recitation of liturgies by rote at the prompting of some guy in a robe standing behind a pulpit.  <br />James discloses that he is neither a theologian nor a religious person himself, which gives him two advantages -- first, that he presents his subject as an empirical science rather than groundless philosophy or internal speculation, and second, that he is free of bias, for how could a religious person be trusted not to sway the study exclusively towards his own experiences?  Variety is the key, and religious experiences are necessarily as various as fingerprints; James's purpose is not to identify the commonalities that group a certain selection of people into a single organized religion but to highlight their differences.  <br />The religious phenomena discussed in the book cover a wide range of concepts like conversion, fanaticism, asceticism, sacrifice, saintliness, and mysticism, which James defines more or less as a state of consciousness invoked by a transient surge of sensation rather than by mental effort.  The religious urge, James concludes, comes from an inherent sense of &quot;wrongness&quot;: Man, being imperfect or aware of imperfections in himself, needs God or a higher power to represent perfection and to save him from his wrongness.<br />One thesis is on the happiness that results from religious satisfaction, to which &quot;mind cures,&quot; involving the association of a healthy body with a healthy mind, are related.  James then introduces the idea of the &quot;sick soul,&quot; in which he asserts that evil, by which he means hopelessness and pessimism, is a disease -- a notion, incidentally, that had been satirized by Samuel Butler in &quot;Erewhon.&quot;  Another interesting insight, reminiscent of the theme of Flannery O'Connor's &quot;Wise Blood,&quot; is the observation that the atheistic denial of God has a religiously zealous temperament of its own.  <br />Even though these are lectures, James doesn't do all the talking.  He frequently relates people's religious experiences in their own words; in fact, I estimate that quotations and footnotes constitute more than half of the text.  The recipient of a thorough education, James was one of the great American intellectual voices of his century but is never pedantic; his fluent prose bears strangely little resemblance to the garish constructions of his novelist brother Henry.  The book's emphasis on psychology may surprise a reader who expects a work on traditional theology, and its impartiality may offend one who insists on the absolute sovereignty of his own religion, but James deserves credit for a perspective that is original and intelligent without intending to be controversial.	2003-12-01
US	49396726	R1MQF7KO56N716	0679760806	778351106	The Master and Margarita	Books	5	6	7	N	N	An infernal holiday in Moscow	Bulgakov's &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; is a Goethean fantasy, but like other twentieth century masterpieces of magical realism such as &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; and &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; it presents a considerable challenge to the reviewer obligated to describe the oddness of its content.  There is so much madness that a plot summary seems pointless, and so much richness that only a firsthand reading experience can do the text justice.  As a novel that channels the phantasmagorical into a critique of the society from which it springs and the government under which it was suppressed, it balances humor with creepiness in a way that renders it closer to &quot;The Man Who was Thursday&quot; than to &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;  <br />The stars of the novel are a devilish syndicate intent upon wreaking havoc among Moscow society.  The ringleader is a magician who subtly calls himself Woland and has a retinue of strange but useful henchmen, including most curiously a huge talking black cat that walks upright and plays chess.  The beginning of the novel, in which Woland approaches two literary men who deny the existence of Christ and refutes them by claiming to have been a witness at the Crucifixion, introduces the novel's subtext, a secondary story about Pontius Pilate, the procurator of Judea, who happens to be the subject of a novel composed by a writer known only as the Master.<br />The role of literature under Stalin's regime is a major theme.  A young poet named Ivan the Homeless, who writes antireligious propaganda for an intellectual magazine, is suspected of insanity and institutionalized after his encounter with Woland ends in a shockingly violent scene.  In the sanatarium he meets the Master, whose life has been reduced to ruins after having his novel rejected for publication and his character defamed by the Soviet press.  The Master's conflict with the literary authorities is echoed in the domestic situation of his unhappily married lover Margarita, who liberates herself after a fateful meeting with one of Woland's associates.  <br />My favorite character is easily the cat, who goes by the appropriate name of Behemoth.  Like a cartoonist, Bulgakov recognizes that animals are more convincing as agents of human thoughts and actions when they're bipedal and prehensile, and so creates a cat that's too cool for his company, a laconic sort of fellow who, commanded by Woland to leave the room because of his insolence, nonchalantly replies that he hasn't had his coffee yet.  Of course, logic suggests that he is not really a cat, but in a work of fantasy, logic must yield its primacy to the caprices of imagination.  <br />The scenes are a smooth synergy of the natural and the supernatural: a bombastic magic show at a theater, gratuitous decapitations, a skin cream whose application conjures a witch's ride, a roaring fireplace that serves as a gateway to hell, a Satanic ball, a police shootout with a pistol-packing Behemoth swinging on a chandelier, characters inexplicably named after composers.  Probably the most venomous diatribe against the repressive Soviet literary politics of the day, &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; glows like a neon sign in the night in brazen defiance of censorship.	2003-11-20
US	49396726	RWZENTNM241D1	0140189440	199278992	Humboldt's Gift (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)	Books	5	62	66	N	N	Odyssey of an American poet	As in Bellow's &quot;Herzog&quot; and &quot;Seize the Day,&quot; the protagonist of &quot;Humboldt's Gift&quot; is a highly educated late-middle-aged man who's made a minor mess of his life but weathers the storm with any resources of which he can avail himself.  Charlie Citrine, an Appleton, Wisconsin, native transplanted to Chicago, is an author and a briefly successful playwright who spends the novel reminiscing about his longtime friendship with the late poet Von Humboldt Fleisher, an eccentric genius and self-diagnosed manic depressive, and describing the people and events in his life that somehow seem to shape themselves around his relationship with Humboldt.<br />Humboldt once had a goal to raise the esteem of the poet's role in American society.  In 1952 he believed an Adlai Stevenson presidency would allow the involvement of more intellectuals in government; when this hope crumbled, he sought and won an ephemeral poetry chair at Princeton, where he and Citrine concocted a strangely Sophoclean movie treatment about a doomed Arctic expedition and a man who became a cannibal.  This was not the last of their show business aspirations; Citrine's play, &quot;Von Trenck,&quot; based loosely on Humboldt's life and therefore vexatious to Humboldt, was a hit on the theater circuit and was made into a movie.   <br />Citrine's dubious fortune attracts all kinds of problems with love and money.  His ex-wife Denise is straining him over an uncomfortable divorce settlement; his new girlfriend, a much younger woman named Renata, takes advantage of him and leaves him stranded in Madrid to babysit her son.  A simple poker night results in an undesirable association with a small-time gangster named Rinaldo Cantabile from which he can't seem to extricate himself.  <br />Character creation is where Bellow really excels; he seeks the individual in every person he invents and never exploits stereotypes or resorts to caricatures for the sake of broad humor.  Observe the swaggeringconfidence of Citrine's friend George Swiebel, an actor turned construction contractor; the smug demeanor of the dapper, cosmopolitan Thaxter, whom Citrine hires as an editor for a magazine yet (and probably never) to be published; the affectionate gruffness of Citrine's older brother Julius, a wealthy, sickly businessman who never shed his working-class sensibilities.  These are people you'd be no more surprised to meet in reality than on the pages of a book.<br />A criticism against Bellow is that he has a tendency to sacrifice cohesive plots for the random portrayal of human hysteria, a collection of disparate people thrown together haphazardly.  The problem is not that his novels lack believability; rather, they are often too believable, and sometimes I think they would benefit from just a little more artifice.  In that regard, &quot;Humboldt's Gift&quot; strikes me as one of his better novels along with &quot;Henderson the Rain King,&quot; built upon a substantial story that achieves a certain amount of closure because the protagonist is finally entrusted with a responsibility (the &quot;gift&quot;) that, handled properly, could change his life for the better.	2003-11-17

His novel \\"Pamela\\" serves an explicit purpose, announced on its title page as intending \\"to cultivate the Principles of Virtue and Religion in the Minds of the YOUTH of BOTH SEXES [sic],\\" and this self-righteous statement invokes a suspicion, almost a conviction, that the book's value is instructional rather than literary.  Can it be both, and can it still be enjoyable?  Yes, it is both, and no, it is not very enjoyable.    <br />Richardson's heroine, the fifteen-year-old Pamela Andrews, a girl so lily-white and virtuous she almost rides into the story on a unicorn, works as a maid for a wealthy young man discreetly called Mr. B.  He is attracted to her and treats her most ignobly, kissing her despite her protests, grappling her like an octopus, feeling her up, calling her a slut, reading her mail, deceiving her poor parents, and finally having her kidnapped and imprisoned in his rural house.  This much of the novel is epistolary, in which Pamela wails about her distress in letters to her parents, who are concerned but unable to help her aside from giving her advice filled with platitudes about minding her virtue.  <br />The second part of the novel is in the form of a diary, in which Pamela relates how her virtuous resistance to Mr. B's salacious persistence culminates in his offer to marry her, which she accepts.  Okay, so now what?  Richardson's next step is to introduce class warfare.  Mr. B's sister, Lady Davers, admonishes her brother about the impropriety of his marrying a vulgar wench like Pamela when he should be seeking a girl of the aristocracy.  The dignity with which Pamela responds to Lady Davers's snobbish attitude shows that while Richardson may have been high-minded about morals, he was definitely not a supporter of elitism.         <BR> <BR>The challenge in reading this novel is to try to take it seriously without discarding modern notions about proper gender relations.  Itmay be argued that Richardson is really pointing the finger of scorn at Mr. B, but since Pamela is the focus and the voice of the story, it almost seems that the burden of remaining virtuous is being placed on her and not on her immoral aggressor, who knows better but thinks his privileged social status gives him license to do as he pleases.  And then one day he realizes the iniquity of his character, reverses his behavior, makes an honorable overture to his lady, and suddenly everything's wonderful.  Sure.<br />\\"Pamela\\" basically fuses together two genres, the morality tale and the Cinderella story, and a formula like this was bound to invite waves of adoration, commentary, and controversy.  Fans loved the book's optimism; puritanical detractors accused it of being merely prurient.  Henry Fielding, possibly inspired by the book's humorless earnestness, even wrote a parody (\\"Shamela\\") in which the heroine really *was* a slut.  Whether \\"Pamela\\" deserves to be read in the twenty-first century is difficult to judge; it can't quite be recommended on the strength of its narrative, but readers who feel the need to see an example of \\"virtue rewarded\\" could do a lot worse.	2003-11-13

Gardner sees the shaggy, anthropomorphous monster as a painfully self-conscious creature bellowing in rage at the forces of nature in agonistic protest against his miserable existence as a descendant of the cursed race of Cain.<br />Grendel is sad, lonely, and bored.  His only friend (besides his mother, who offers little conversational companionship) is a wise ancient dragon who sits on a massive treasure hoard and mentors the young beast in the significance of being a monster, that having the power to terrify and brutalize is just as much an affirmation of life as killing to eat.  And killing is Grendel's forte: He repeatedly targets the thanes of Hrothgar, king of the Danes, who, as descendants of the blessed race of Abel, intrigue him; voyeuristically he spies on them in their meadhalls, sardonically observing their folly, believing that he provides for them a healthy challenge to their complacency.  He particularly enjoys the ineffectual assaults of a warrior named Unferth who seeks hero status by trying to slay Grendel numerous times and whom Grendel always spares out of spite, to dishonor him and amplify his ineptitude.  <br />If Grendel were human, he'd be called a sociopath.  He hates himself, men, and the world, but he turns his extreme negativity into a strange attitude of superiority -- he likes to show his enemies that he can always beat them, that they're defenseless against his aggression and foolish as well.  Of course, he finally realizes his limits when one fateful day an unnamed Geat prince arrives on Hrothgar's shores, ready to claim his own superiority.<br />A few weeks ago I read Jean Rhys's &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; which invents abackground story for a mysteriously obscure but important character from &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;  Gardner employs the same concept in &quot;Grendel&quot; and even uses a similar postmodern prose style, but he succeeds where Rhys failed because he gives Grendel a personality, a reason to exist as a character, and doesn't just make him a mute symbol of victimization.  Grendel is a powerhouse and doesn't need anybody to feel sorry or make excuses for him.	2003-11-10

But it is not the goal of &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; to be merely a sentimental portrait of a region for which Hardy has a great affection, but a grandiose drama about the eventual union of a man and the woman he loves.  In summary, Hardy does accede to a Happily Ever After ending, but how he gets to this point is why his novel deserves to be read.<br />It's not surprising that the novel was originally attributed to George Eliot because the protagonist, Gabriel Oak, as the novel's moral anchor, is very similar in character to Eliot's Adam Bede.  Oak is trying to make a living on his own as a farmer, but a stroke of bad luck compels him to take a job as a shepherd for a beautiful young woman named Bathsheba Everdene who has recently inherited her uncle's farm and commands a large number of workers and servants.  Oak iconically personifies the rustic setting, not only because of his surname but because of the intimacy with which he communes with nature, and his fondness for playing the flute seems designed to evoke an image of Pan.<br />Oak has an awkward history with Bathsheba -- he had known her before her windfall, but in her independent spirit she spurned his love.  As the head of Weatherbury farm, however, she can't get by on her independence alone, and she needs Oak's expertise in ensuring her sheep are healthy and fit for wool production.  Her romantic attention turns toward a profligate soldier named Francis Troy who, through an unlikely error, has just barely avoided wedding Fanny Robin, one of the Weatherbury servants.  Bathsheba's eventual marriage to Troy breaks the hearts of Oak and another rival, a neighboring farmer named Boldwood whose affections she had once teased and whose obsessive nature erupts at a most climactic moment in the novel.<br />The plot developments are a flamboyant display of contrivance, but Hardy masters his devices so well it's impossible not to go along with him for the ride.  As an example, consider the jilted Fanny who is so weary from sickness that she has to use a dog as a crutch to get to her destination where she finally dies; not until Hardy reveals what's written on the lid of her coffin do we (and Oak) realize the role Troy played in her death.  Likewise, Troy's impulsive reaction to this incident seems like a purposely destructive measure that intends to stir even more turbulence into the story.<br />A large part of Hardy's appeal is his prose, which maximizes the value of a mastery of language; his sentences are like finely cut gems that demand to be held up to a light and studied for their craftsmanship.  I believe that Hardy is the consummate novelist; he approaches the art of the novel as a painter looks upon a canvas, a weaver upon a tapestry, a composer upon an opera -- as the supreme representation of man in harmony with nature and in conflict with fate.at a most climactic moment in the novel.<br />The plot developments are a flamboyant display of contrivance, but Hardy masters his devices so well it's impossible not to go along with him for the ride.

It is not necessary to know much about Caesar to sense the power of the drama; the play provides just enough background and information about Caesar's personality to suggest the reason for his murder and its consequences.<br />In historical actuality, Caesar's murder was in some ways the pivot around which Rome transformed from a republic into an empire, and the play, which Shakespeare bases faithfully on Plutarch's histories, is ultimately about the political struggle that drives this transformation.  The main conspirator against Caesar, and the one to deal him the final blow, is Brutus, who foresees nothing but tyranny if Caesar is made a king.  There is something atavistic about his attitude, for he is descended from the family that was instrumental in turning the kingdom of Rome into a republic five centuries earlier.<br />The scenes leading up to Caesar's murder build with forceful tension.  We see Brutus discussing with his co-conspirator Cassius the dangers of Caesar's ascension and Cassius's sympathetic response, the conspirators meeting at night to plan their attack on Caesar in the Capitol, Caesar's disregard of a soothsayer's prophecies of doom, and then the bloody climax, even after which the drama loses not a bit of momentum:  Brutus appeals to the people (the Plebeians) that the assassination of Caesar, whom they loved and did not at all consider a potential tyrant, was only for their own good; while Mark Antony, one of Caesar's triumvirate and an eloquent orator, cajoles the people with demagogic irony into suspecting the murder happened for no reason other than malice.<br />Shakespeare fashions Caesar and Brutus more or less as two sides of the same denarius.  Caesar is physically frail and deaf in one ear, but that doesn't preclude his triumphant success as a general and a military strategist.  He is also pompous and fatuously vain -- there is nothing he fears more than to appear cowardly to his peers.  Brutus is cut out of the same stock of hubris, but his motivations are purely altruistic.  He loves Rome -- as a republic -- and will do anything to save it from a dictator, even kill a man he considers a friend and attempt to ally himself with foreign nations to wage a civil war against the armies of the now-empowered Roman triumvirate.  Shakespeare brings all of this to light in a humanistic portrait of one of the most fascinating figures from history and his idealistic destroyer.	2003-10-27

Hoban chooses as his setting the county of Kent in southeastern England, now called Inland, where in 1997 something called the Power Ring, encircling what used to be Canterbury, was responsible for a nuclear cataclysm called the 1 Big 1 that nearly destroyed the earth.  In the thousands of years since, mankind has undergone an evolutionary breakdown and reverted to Iron Age technology and tribal society, hunting with spears, scavenging for scrap metal, and speaking a vestigial form of Cockney English.    <br />Twelve-year-old Riddley Walker, as one of the few literate people in his community, is the voice of the novel and writes in a manner that reflects the primitive speech of his society, constructing jagged sentences and spelling words phonetically.  He alone senses the greatness of the civilization that was destroyed so long ago; he wonders why his own people are unable to put &quot;boats in the air and picters on the wind.&quot;  As a &quot;connexion&quot; man, he channels the spirit of an entity named Eusa, a mythical figure to whom the 1 Big 1 and perhaps even all of creation are attributed.  The origin of Eusa's name is associated with the most famous landmark in &quot;Cambry,&quot; the former Canterbury; an eyeless boy Riddley meets named Lissener, who proclaims himself the &quot;Ardship of Cambry,&quot; shows the peculiar logic with which the theologies from the two epochs have merged.<br />One day while excavating in a place called Widders Dump, Riddley finds a Punch hand puppet -- with a severed hand still inside.  Abel Goodparley, Inland's &quot;Pry Mincer,&quot; recognizes this theatrical artifact, but its purpose is lost on the Inlanders, whose only concept of entertainment is the &quot;shows&quot; that retell the Eusa legend.  Nevertheless, this puppet is the catalyst that inspires Riddley to escape his confinement as a connexion man and forge a new path.<br />While the story has plenty of violence, particularly when Riddley discovers a substance which, when mixed with &quot;Saul &amp; Peter&quot; and &quot;chard coal,&quot; makes a powerful explosive, it does not try to resolve any conflicts by culminating in a violent climax.  Hoban wisely avoids trite devices like a final showdown between warring factions and morality lessons about good against evil, nor does he use the novel as a public service announcement to warn us about the horrors of a post-nuclear age; the focus is purely on the awakening of a civilization to the possibilities of change.<br />The novel is admittedly difficult to read and understand; the words require extraordinary concentration to absorb what Riddley is trying to say, but after the struggle I was left with the impression of having just read a work of brilliance.  Like the fiction of Joyce and Faulkner, it creates its own bold style of communication and rewards the diligent and observant reader who enjoys the challenge of confronting an unfamiliar milieu with cryptic symbols.  As Riddley says, &quot;There aint that many sir prizes in life if you take noatis of every thing.&quot;	2003-10-20
US	49396726	R1YYQIP3I3YYUG	0140158502	938486140	The Cornish Trilogy: The Rebel Angels; What's Bred in the Bone; The Lyre of Orpheus	Books	5	33	33	N	N	A frenzy of artistic expression	Robertson Davies writes like a friendly, jocose composite of every college professor you've ever had.  Like Rabelais, the French Renaissance scholar who is one of the many subjects of &quot;The Cornish Trilogy,&quot; he is amazingly learned and uses his fiction to display the staggering expanse of his knowledge, but he understands the inherent joy in reading and learning and balances his writing with equal measures of highbrow, middlebrow, and lowbrow humor.    <br />These three novels revolve around a man named Francis Cornish whose wealth, talent, and connections elevate his uncommonly consequential life almost to the status of an Ontario folk legend.  Growing up in a rural town called Blairlogie, he develops a sensibility for the power of visual images and becomes an artist and an art connoisseur, educating himself at the University of Toronto's College of St. John and the Holy Ghost, affectionately called Spook.  After working as an art assessor and spying for the British from a Bavarian castle during World War II, he spends the rest of his life amassing a tremendous collection of art, books, and manuscripts, which he leaves to Spook and other Canadian institutes upon his death.<br />The trilogy's second novel, &quot;What's Bred in the Bone,&quot; in which Cornish's life story is narrated by a Recording Angel, is like the gentle, reflective adagio of a three-movement symphony.  By contrast, the first novel, &quot;The Rebel Angels,&quot; in which three Spook professors, the executors of Cornish's will, are assigned to catalogue and distribute the bequeathal, is in a modern Rabelaisian spirit: erudite, bawdy, and perverse.  The discovery of an unknown Rabelais manuscript leads to an academic uproar among Clement Hollier, his nubile graduate student Maria, and his obnoxious rival Urquhart McVarish, whose tea-time companion, the boorish ex-monk John Parlabane, will do literally anything to get his unreadable autobiographical novel published.  <br />The third novel,&quot;The Lyre of Orpheus,&quot; concerns itself with an unfinished opera about King Arthur by E.T.A. Hoffmann which is found among Cornish's manuscripts.  As a tribute to their benefactor, the Cornish Foundation allows to have the opera completed by a filthy waif of a girl who goes by the name of Schnak and is being hailed as a musical prodigy, with the libretto penned by Simon Darcourt, Spook's resident Anglican priest.  The proceedings are annotated by none other than the ghost of Hoffmann himself, trapped in Limbo because he was unable to complete his Arthurian opera, and the Cornish Foundation's effort is his only chance to pass on to the next world.  As the fledgling opera goes into production, Davies gives a brilliantly colorful account of the stormy dramas and passions involved in the world of musical theater.   <br />These novels are broad satires of the worlds of academics, art, and music, respectively, and the main characters are so fatuously self-important they almost dare the reader to hate them.  The general theme is the imagined conflict between the artist and the philistine, illustrated by Hoffmann's Johannes Kreisler/Tomcat Murr alter egos, but this imaginary line is only as thick as we make it.  If, as Hoffmann's ghost says, a philistine is someone who is content to live in a wholly unexplored world, then Davies's &quot;Cornish&quot; trilogy acts wonderfully as an antiphilistine corrective.	2003-10-15
US	49396726	R2FCELASM94NS0	0679745580	990777880	In Cold Blood	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Pinnacle of the True Crime genre	The smelly, hairy armpit of every bookstore is its True Crime section, shelved with scores of Ann Rule-styled mass-market paperbacks with black covers and fluorescent-lettered titles intended to shock, promising pages of murder and mayhem illustrated by grainy black-and-white photos, ultimately delivering banality in a glossy package.  However, Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood,\\" although sharing the purpose of the company it keeps, is a diamond in the rough.  With sharp psychological insight and prose that is lithe and sophisticated without assuming an opulence that risks overdressing its grisly subject matter, Capote writes like he sincerely cares about not just the victims and the murderers, but everybody involved in the investigation of the case and then some.   <br />The case is fairly simple:  On a November night in 1959 in the tiny western Kansas prairie town of Holcomb, two ex-convicts, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, entered a farm house belonging to the Clutters, one of the richest and most respected families in the county, tied up Herb Clutter, his wife Bonnie, his son Kenyon, and his daughter Nancy with cords and killed them with a shotgun.  The motive is not difficult to deduce from the outset; by introducing the killers early, Capote fashions the book not as a mystery but as a study of criminal behavior.<br />In leading up to the crime, the narration alternates between the domestic tranquility of the Clutter family, a picture so innocent and wholesomely American it belongs on a Christmas card, and the sinister machinations and bizarre delusions of the killers as they travel hundreds of miles to Holcomb to do their deed.  After the murders have been committed, leaving the town horrified and puzzled, the book follows Dick and Perry's cross-country trips in search of the next big score while special agents from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation probe the crime scene for evidence (the killers cleverly leave almost none) and interrogate the few witnesses who have anything to say.  Capote manages to relate something valuable about every person the investigation encounters, from a gas station attendant to the woman who runs Holcomb's post office, so the book reads like a novel of rich characterization.<br />An inevitable breakthrough in the case leads to the arrest of Dick and Perry, who have not covered their tracks well.  From here, Capote examines the relevant details of their trial, in which they are convicted, and their appeals while they await execution on Death Row.  Even to the very end we are continually informed that the book's devotion is to its killers' life stories, given clinical treatment during the trial in which we hear (off the record) professional psychoanalyses that attempt to explain how a man might become a monster.  Although \\"In Cold Blood\\" could be criticized for apparently sympathizing with the killers, it manages to acknowledge their humanity without apologizing for or attempting to justify their violent actions.	2003-10-09

But Pushkin constantly reminds us that in no way is he a pioneer -- one of the most remarkable things these stories display is their author's reverent awareness of his lesser-known antecedents, effectively providing a chronological and artistic link with obscure names from the Russian and other European bodies of literature.<br />The &quot;Tales of Belkin&quot; sacrifice realism for plot devices that are either dramatic (a revisited duel in &quot;The Shot,&quot; a repentant Prodigal Daughter in &quot;The Postmaster&quot;), contrived (mistaken identity in &quot;The Blizzard,&quot; impersonation in &quot;The Squire's Daughter&quot;), or grotesque (a reveling coffin builder gets what he asks for in &quot;The Undertaker&quot;).  These stories are clearly among the roots of the genre that was later to be embellished stylishly by the likes of Chekhov and Maupassant.<br />The &quot;History&quot; chronicling the strange customs of the village of Goryukhino is fashioned so wryly and whimsically, its effect so subtly humorous, that one wonders about the seriousness of Pushkin's intent.  &quot;Kirdzhali&quot; is a concise but meaty tale of a rogue warrior and escape artist, while &quot;Egyptian Nights&quot; tells of an Italian balladeer in St. Petersburg desperately in search of an audience. <br />But the supreme achievement in this collection is &quot;A Journey to Arzrum,&quot; in which Pushkin describes his passage from Moscow south through the Caucasus and Georgia towards Turkey during the 1829 war between the latter country and Russia.  Replete with anecdotes involving the inhabitants of and the travelers through these exotic, isolated regions, the architecture of the cities, and the wonders of the scenery, the &quot;Journey&quot; is journalistic adventure writing at its finest.<br />Pushkin finishes his picaresque memoir on a decidedly unheroic note, however, when on his return journey he happens to see an insultingly negative review of one of his published poems in a Russian periodical.  As his momentary vexation turns to sarcastic laughter, he confirms a sense of humor and humility that, however uncharacteristic it may seem for a young Russian writer of his day, is thoroughly apparent in his personality as a storyteller.	2003-10-08

In setting and characterization, it is far removed from Edith Wharton's normal milieu of the New York upper class, but it is just as thematically grave and as beautifully written as her best work.<br />The place is a small town in rural Massachussetts called Starkfield and the title character is a relatively poor and unassuming man who owns an unprofitable farm and a sawmill.  He is unhappily married to a woman named Zeena, his cousin actually, an obvious hypochondriac who complains of an unidentifiable illness and is almost always bedridden.  Ethan is attracted to her younger cousin Mattie, who is living with them to nurse Zeena and perform the household chores, and the interest is mutual but the prognosis is bleak.  Zeena stands in the way of their illicit love and, after an incident involving a broken dish she treasured dearly, gives Mattie her walking papers with the intention of hiring a new girl.  Ethan considers that he could run away with Mattie, but he is too conscientious about Zeena to leave her alone on the farm unable to support herself.  How he and Mattie decide to resolve this dilemma is startling and even a little sickening, with an outcome that is as unforgettable as it is unforeseeable, for the lovers as well as for the readers.<br /><br />Wharton's cleverness is evident in this short novel's highly effective structure, which maximizes suspense without introducing much extraneous detail.  The &quot;main&quot; story is sandwiched by that of a nameless first-person narrator who, while sojourning in Starkfield, becomes fascinated by Ethan's mystique and the legend of his &quot;smash-up&quot; and, befriending the man, imagines in flashback the events that explain his present state.  As expected with Wharton, the writing itself is a model of effortlessly mellifluent but economical prose which endows the story with a satisfying brevity and a palpable tension among its desperate characters.s a model of effortlessly mellifluent but economical prose which endows the story with a satisfying brevity and a palpable tension among its desperate characters.	2003-10-01

It's nice that Jean Rhys, like many other readers including myself, admired Charlotte Bronte's monumental &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and apparently was intrigued by Bertha, the infamous madwoman in the attic, but why did she feel compelled to write a novel filling in the blanks of this woman's past?  The character of Bertha, who is said by some to symbolize repressed feminine sexuality, was intended by Bronte to be a mystery and to remain a mystery, and Rhys's attempt to invent a solution to this mystery is feeble, unenlightening, and unwelcome.<br />Rhys has all the details in order.  Born as Antoinette Cosway to a semi-Creole family of slaveowners, &quot;Bertha&quot; grows up on a dilapidated estate in Jamaica with a widowed mother who later marries a man named Mason.  After a fire which destroys the estate (wink, wink) and in which her younger brother perishes, Antoinette is educated at a convent and becomes the bride of a young Englishman named Rochester who receives a large dowry for her from Mason.  However, there is unhappiness on both sides of the marriage bed, resulting in Antoinette's gradual descent into insanity and Rochester's exasperation with his new wife's neurotic behavior.  In fact, one of the novel's better moments depicts Rochester, regretful of the prospect of being inseparably tied to this batty woman for the rest of his life, contemplatively drawing a stick figure representation of her locked up in the attic of an English house, the effect of which is unintentionally comical but not a little eerie.<br />The novel ends with Antoinette, whom Rochester now calls Bertha, as a pyromaniacal prisoner in Thornfield Hall as her husband envisioned in his crude sketch, and...well, so what?  What exactly was Rhys trying to demonstrate with this little exercise in speculative characterdevelopment?  The unique intensity of her passion for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;?  Her sense of identity with Bertha because she was a West Indian Creole herself?  The mess she could make of her prose by affecting a clumsy stream-of-consciousness narration that reads like third-rate Virginia Woolf?  This is a misguided abortion of a prequel that does not merit an association with its source of inspiration.	2003-09-29
US	49396726	R7W9EEMVTBXPX	067978330X	289712823	Anna Karenina (Modern Library Classics)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The pulse of Czarist society	&quot;Anna Karenina&quot; can be said to have two concurrent stories, one ending happily, the other tragically, united with themes of love, marriage, adultery, parenthood, neglect, work, and spirituality, and populated with characters so genuine the reader inevitably feels that Tolstoy's portrayal of the Russian middle and upper classes of the late nineteenth century is one to be trusted.  Where else can you get an insight as bluntly candid as the notion that it was considered by the aristocracy to be much more honorable to serve the Czar as a government employee, even if the job paid peanuts, than for example to work at a bank with the possibility of having a Jew for a boss?  (See Part VII, Chapter 17.)<br />The novel begins with Count Oblonsky in the doghouse.  His wife Dolly has caught him having an affair with the kids' governess and is threatening to leave him, but fortunately his sister, the titular Anna, comes to visit and manages to talk Dolly into forgiving her husband.  This has to be one of the most ironic overtures in literature because it is not long before Anna, wife of a prominent man much older than herself and mother of a little son, starts her own affair with a rakish young military officer named Count Vronsky.<br />How Karenin, Anna's husband, handles the knowledge of his wife's extramarital interest is a great study of moral dilemma and conflict.  Summarily rejecting the ideas of challenging Vronsky to a duel, which would be dangerous, and obtaining a divorce, which would shame him and reward Anna for her infidelity, he concludes that the best course of action is to try to appeal to her sense of social propriety and maternal responsibility.  It's hopeless, though; she moves in with Vronsky and has a daughter by him, continually imploring Karenin to grant her a divorce, which he steadfastly refuses.  One of the novel's exceptional successes is the demonstration of something Anna did not foresee: the unendurable emotional strain on an adult with two families.<br />The other story involves Oblonsky's friend Konstantin Levin, a landowner and farmer who is enamored with Dolly's pretty, younger sister Kitty.  After being spurned by her in favor of Vronsky, he resigns himself to lifelong bachelorhood, taking care of his land, fraternizing with his tenant farmers, and concerning himself with agricultural, economic, political, and religious matters.  His eventual marriage to Kitty after winning back her love seems to exemplify a favorite Tolstoy theme of man's triumph through self-redemption and the willingness to renounce a materialistic attitude.<br />The excessive length of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; belies the simplicity and clarity of Tolstoy's writing, which has a sincerity that indicates a reflection of the author's deep personal convictions.  He is never as bleak or as cynical as Dostoevsky, and though he can be mawkish at times, he always seeks the goodness in his characters without exaggerating the natural drama in any given situation.  If Anna's ultimate fate seems like an exaggeration, consider how many people less troubled than her do the same thing every day in real life.o families.<br />The other story involves Oblonsky's friend Konstantin Levin, a landowner and farmer who is enamored with Dolly's pretty, younger sister Kitty.

The Corrected Text	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Ghosts of the Old South	Faulkner is notoriously cruel to his readers for making them scrape and dig for details in his almost incomprehensibly dense chronicles of the fictional families of Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, but not for nothing is he one of the greatest of American writers.  A story is not a collection of cold hard facts but of ideas and images designed to make us exercise the remotest faculties of our minds, and Faulkner's fiction presses the buttons and turns the dials that set our mental mechanisms in motion.<br />&quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; is a particularly intricate machine that links the Old South with the New and features a family tree whose branches are gnarled beyond all reasonable efforts at traceability.  The trunk is a man named Thomas Sutpen, who, after an adventurous youth in Virginia and the West Indies, arrives in YoCo in the 1830's with a large supply of money and black slaves, builds a plantation, marries a local girl, Ellen Coldfield, and fathers two children, Henry and Judith, envisioning a fruitful dynasty. <br />In Faulkner's characteristically confusing style, the story is narrated through a few different viewpoints.  The closest to the Sutpen family is Ellen's sister Rosa Coldfield, who happens to be younger than Henry and Judith.  She has suffered some unhappy experiences as a result of being associated with Sutpen, but she retains a certain pride as she recounts her history to Quentin Compson, the morose young man who, we know from &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; is later to drown himself in the Charles River.  Quentin also gets information from his father, whose own father was a close friend of Sutpen's, and in turn discusses the Sutpen saga with his Harvard roommate Shreve, to whom Quentin insists, as the novel ends, that he doesn't hate the South.      <br />As in &quot;Light in August,&quot; race consciousness is a major subject in &quot;A, A!&quot;  Thomas Sutpen is revealed to have fathered a boy named Charles Bon by a Haitian woman hethought was &quot;pure&quot; white, but he abandons her and the baby when he learns of her mixed ancestry.  Later, he has a daughter named Clytemnestra (oh, the implications) by one of his slave women, proving himself to be a rather lecherous sort of hypocrite.  Trouble begins when Henry meets his half-brother Charles at the University of Mississippi and brings him home, where he and Judith fall in love; Quentin's ultimate lesson about the Sutpens is that irony is a merciless punisher of irresponsibility. <br />&quot;A, A!&quot; returns to the impressionistic style of narration used in &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and &quot;As I Lay Dying.&quot;  There are frequent shifts in focus and voice and extremely long parenthetical digressions which make this a difficult novel, but this is the kind of difficulty that gives Faulkner's fiction its substance.  With an almost Shakespearean sensibility, Faulkner creates majestic characters of dazzling complexity and brooding intensity out of the basic cloth of ordinary folks, which is why figures like Thomas Sutpen, Quentin Compson, and Rosa Coldfield survive in our memories long after we finish reading the novel.	2003-09-15
US	49396726	R372BVX8NRHZRG	0679720219	764255828	The Plague	Books	5	7	8	N	N	The trauma of a postwar existence	In &quot;The Plague,&quot; Camus updates a medieval horror to the twentieth century to introduce a new concept to his main literary theme of man faced with the absurd.  Coming hot on the heels of World War II, it could be seen as an allegory of the eternal struggle between two major human forces -- love and hope on one side, death and destruction on the other.<br />The setting is Oran, a medium-sized city on the Mediterranean coast of Algeria, home to many French and Spanish foreigners.  With an inspired sense of tension and drama, Camus builds up the plague as a series of morbid omens:  A few dead rats turn up in the streets, their numbers soon growing into the thousands; a woman approaches a doctor's passing car, screaming in pain as blood drips from her crotch; people begin to suffer from buboes and ganglia which stiffen their joints and precede their death; a stricken opera singer falls dead upon the stage during a performance as the audience watches in sickened dismay.  The city's government and medical establishment quickly move to quarantine the infected populace, and the city gates are locked and guarded by sentries to prevent people from entering or leaving, which results in panic and chaos.<br />How a city handles a plague has been covered in Daniel Defoe's journalistically toned &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; (1722), but Camus's novel is less about the disease than about the sensibilities of a group of specific characters.  The central figure is Dr. Bernard Rieux, an important local physician who helps to organize &quot;sanitary squads&quot; which try to isolate the infirm.  The events of the plague are recorded by a diarist named Jean Tarrou, who, as a staunch believer in the right to life for all people, represents the novel's humanist conscience.<br />A moral dilemma is personified by a journalist named Rambert, who has been quarantined in Oran and wants to get back to France to see his wife, illegally if necessary; ultimately he makes the brave decision to stay and aid the sanitary squads, persuaded partly by the knowledge that Rieux's own wife is away in a sanatorium for an unrelated illness.  There are also two comical characters in the shapes of Joseph Grand, a municipal clerk who is working on a novel but is so fastidious a stylist that he can't get past the first sentence; and Cottard, a criminal who postpones his suicide when he notices that the authorities are currently much more concerned with suppressing the plague than prosecuting him.<br />Of course, the plague eventually subsides of its own nature, although its turning point in the novel coincides with, and may be related symbolically to, a shocking decision made by one of the main characters.  The impression Camus gives is that, after the celebration of the return to normality is over, the people will probably go back to living very much the same way they did before, which suggests that human resilience is stronger than a need for faith.brave decision to stay and aid the sanitary squads, persuaded partly by the knowledge that Rieux's own wife is away in a sanatorium for an unrelated illness.

US	49396726	R73O15WSBOM6F	0812505042	691093854	The Time Machine	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Puncturing the fourth dimension	The \\"stranger in a strange land\\" genre -- ordinary men adventuring in extraordinary places -- is at least as old as Homer, but H.G. Wells's great invention in \\"The Time Machine\\" is to have his protagonist visit a land that is separated from his home by time, not distance.  This man, who in the novel is enigmatically known only as the Time Traveller, contends that time is a dimension that is just as travelable as the three dimensions of space, builds a machine not to test his theory but to demonstrate his conviction, and embarks on a journey into the future while incredulous friends and colleagues wait patiently for his return.<br />His destination is not next week to check the weather, or next year to forecast the stock market, but 802,701 A.D.  He finds that humanity has undergone a curious evolution and divided itself into two subspecies -- simpleminded, childlike little people called the Eloi and apelike subterranean dwellers called Morlocks who prey upon the Eloi.  Hypothesizing that the Eloi are the result of thousands of years of upper class leisure from not having to struggle to survive or worry about diseases and hardships, while the Morlocks are the outcome of the working class's having been forced underground where all industrial operations have been relocated, he implies that social class consciousness is one thing that is sure to survive for 800,000 years.<br />If a time jump of eight hundred millenia seems ludicrously excessive, perhaps Wells wanted to be merely speculative without risking the fallacy of attempting to be prophetic; after all, the farther into the future, the more liberties he could take in imagining what the world would be like.  He uses this unique opportunity to envision terrifying mutations of animal life millions of years beyond the Eloi and the Morlocks; what is so eerie about these images is what we can (or can't) guess about the climatic or environmental circumstances that could cause such monsters to evolve.<br />The level of intelligence of the futuristic monsters is unknown, but the novel's outlook for intellectual evolution is bleak.  When the Time Traveller, scheming to retrieve his Time Machine which has been confiscated by the Morlocks, sees in an abandoned museum a library whose ancient books have decayed to a state of complete illegibility, he sadly muses, \\"Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.\\"  In a novel filled with cryptic scenes, this is quite possibly the most ominous -- a projection of thousands of years of human knowledge blithely going to waste as the species surrenders its intellectual advancement to the vagaries of fate.ntelligence of the futuristic monsters is unknown, but the novel's outlook for intellectual evolution is bleak.

US	49396726	R3PKARH6PM110U	0375759018	205100834	Adam Bede (Modern Library Classics)	Books	5	75	77	N	N	Goodness prevails	Adam Bede, the titular hero of George Eliot's first novel, is of a character so sterling that one little anecdote serves to define his whole life and work ethic:  He's a carpenter, and he had done some work for a lady whose father, an old squire named Donnithorne, suggested that she pay him less than the fee he requested.  Adam insisted that he would rather take no money for the job, for to accept a reduced amount would be like admitting he overcharges for shoddy work.  By standing on his principles, he won his full fee in the end and cemented his reputation as a businessman of honor and acumen, proving his fairness to both his customers and himself.<br />Thus he seems an unlikely match for Hetty Sorrel, the prettiest girl in the village of Hayslope.  Vain, selfish, materialistic, hating her laborious farm chores, Hetty bears more than a passing resemblance to Flaubert's Madame Bovary.  However, while Madame Bovary's unattainable dream world is inspired by her reading romances, Hetty &quot;had never read a novel&quot; so she can't &quot;find a shape for her expectations&quot; regarding love.  Unable to foresee any possible consequences for her actions, she allows herself to be seduced by Arthur Donnithorne, the old squire's grandson, who stands to inherit the land on which most of the Hayslopers live.<br />Arthur is a radiant example of Eliot's mastery in complicated character creation.  Acutely aware of his position in society, he has the kind of charisma with which he can talk to his tenants politely but with just the slightest hint of condescension and completely win their respect for his authority.  In fact, he is so accustomed to receiving nothing but admiration for his apparent moral integrity that it comes as a genuine shock to him when Adam, a man he truly likes, reproaches him for his reckless behavior with Hetty, a girl both he and Adam truly love.  And the tragic irony is that Hetty doesn't really deserve either of them.<br />Religion plays a curious rolein the story.  Adam's brother Seth is infatuated with a woman named Dinah Morris, a cousin's cousin to Hetty and a Methodist evangelistic preacher who was inspired by Wesley in the flesh.  Her influence among the villagers comes to the attention of the Anglican Rev. Dauphin Irwine, the vicar of Hayslope, who visits her to try to figure out her game and concludes that she's essentially a good woman with a good heart.  Indeed, she is the first one to sense that Hetty may be headed for troubled waters and earnestly offers her spiritual guidance, to which Hetty responds with distrust and irritation.<br />Most powerful of the novel's images is that of Hetty wandering through the darkness and dangers of the English countryside in desperate search of the departed Arthur, carrying with her a symbol of their tormented love, and oblivious to the goodness of Adam, whose only desire is to protect her from the disappointment, shame, and disgrace that result from her pitiful reliance on Arthur's ability to buy her pretty things.  But Eliot is too fond of her hero to let him suffer for long when the tides of fate come crashing violently to their inevitable shores, and the ultimate product is a novel of great compassion for its characters.	2003-07-28
US	49396726	R1PFESCU75G3UK	0375703071	996378012	Wolf Solent	Books	5	13	14	N	N	In search of sensations	John Cowper Powys is one of those authors who can be recognized just by the distinction of his prose, employing a style characterized by a picturesque metaphorical lyricism and, particularly in \\"Wolf Solent,\\" the title character's deep introspection regarding his relationship to the world.  Terms like \\"first cause\\" and \\"magnetic\\" are repeated throughout the novel like motifs, revealing the author's preoccupation with metaphysical forces, motivations, and effects.<br />Wolf is a 35-year-old man who, at the beginning of the novel, is moving from London to his native county of Dorsetshire to take a job assisting a wealthy man named Urquhart, the Squire of King's Barton, in writing a book about the more scandalous aspects of the histories of local families.  Wolf finds Urquhart to be rather eccentric and petty and soon learns that his previous assistant, a young man named Redfern, died under disputable circumstances.  This sounds like a setup for an intriguing mystery, especially when Wolf discovers Urquhart's gardener and another man digging around Redfern's grave one night, but the novel is concerned more with the essence of secrecy than with the mechanics of revealing secrets.<br />The residents of Dorsetshire, with their piquant personalities, rustic sincerity, and realistic complexity, are worthy of a Thomas Hardy novel; no set of characters can expect higher praise than that.  They are there not just to drive the plot forward but to act and react against Wolf and each other to create a theater of emotions and passions in which life becomes a colorful, unpredictable masquerade.  The principal players include Jason Otter, a morose, temperamental poet; Selena Gault, an ugly old spinster with whom Wolf's father had had an affair; Tilly-Valley, a foolish vicar; and Bob Weevil, a lascivious butcher whose sausages possibly connote something priapic about his role in the community.<br />Wolf's research brings him to two young ladies with whom he falls in love: Gerda Torp,the stonecutter's daughter, whose stunning beauty and nymphlike nature arouse his sexual desires; and Christie Malakite, the bookseller's daughter, a relatively plain but bright girl who is harboring a vile secret about her father and to whom Wolf relates on an intellectual level.  As Wolf's romantic reveries careen between the two women representing two different erotic ideals, body and mind, we see an intense internal conflict building within him, one that threatens to, but somehow never does, unravel his inner peace.<br />And what is the source of this peace?  Simply that Wolf has escaped the modernity and materialism of London to embrace the idyllic antiquity of rural England and to experience \\"certain sensations\\" -- not that he knows exactly what these are yet, but perhaps the fun is in not knowing, in exploration and self-discovery.  This is also why he is annoyed by the encroachment of automobiles and airplanes into Dorsetshire towards the end of the novel -- twentieth-century technology has no place in the world whose nineteenth-century tranquility he wants dearly to preserve.	2003-07-21
US	49396726	R28T0KO0E6IFGE	0451523377	821153252	Dracula (Signet Classics)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Going for the jugular	When faced with the difficult decision of which undead monster to write about, a writer is best served by choosing vampires, whose awesome abilities and vestiges of human nature -- better conversationalists than zombies and mummies, more civilized than ghouls -- allow them to function as substantial literary characters.<br />Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", however, is less about its title character than it is about the people who are trying to destroy him.  Because the story is narrated by the hunters in a variety of first-person accounts, we get only their perspectives and not that of Dracula himself.  It would have been nice to hear from someone who was once alive about what it's like to be cursed with an eternal undead existence, to be able to climb walls and turn into a bat at will, whether having to feast exclusively on human blood gets monotonous, and if all blood tastes the same.  (I'd imagine some is saltier than others.)<br />The \\"living\\" characters in this novel are, in typical Victorian fashion, wound extremely tight.  First we meet Jonathan Harker, an English solicitor whose firm has been hired by the infamous Transylvanian Count to help him buy a house in England.  After finding himself imprisoned in Dracula's castle, noticing that the Count spends the daylight hours asleep in a coffin in an underground crypt, and being accosted by three female vampires under Dracula's command, Harker guesses that something about his apparently genial host is not quite right.<br />Eventually making his passage to England, Dracula proceeds to feast on a girl named Lucy Westenra, whose friend Mina happens to be Harker's fiancee.  As Lucy lies in bed ailing and becoming paler by the day, a team of highly skilled experts, including the psychiatrist John Seward, the Dutch physician Abraham van Helsing (who speaks in enthusiastic bursts of pidgin English), Lucy's fiancee Lord Godalming, and a \\"laconic\\" Texan named Quincey Morris, is assembled to discuss the problem.  Van Helsing's conclusion: We've got vampires.<br />The novel is more an exercise in suspense than in horror, especially since there is a time element involved -- Mina, also bitten by Dracula, will become a vampire under his power unless he is destroyed.  The descriptions of the Count's desolate mountain castle, the morbid scenes of profuse bloodletting, and the concept of a nearly invincible villain are the very essence of horror, though, and Stoker puts them to as much use as he can.  Many critics have commented on the novel's erotic symbolism, and if these views are valid, all I can say is that Stoker wouldn't be the first or the last author to associate sex with death.	2003-07-14
US	49396726	RLG2EHVSFLN9D	0805210644	840372638	Amerika	Books	5	36	40	N	N	A descent into hell	\\"Amerika\\" looks like it was written by someone who not only had never been to America but did not even care to know what it's really like.  But Kafka's style is all about transforming the real into the surreal, tainting reality and disturbing our sense of order and structure.  Even in the book's very first paragraph, when a ship carrying the protagonist, Karl Rossmann, approaches New York, the Statue of Liberty is depicted as holding in her raised hand not a torch symbolizing a beacon to welcome immigrants, but a sword, ominously threatening aggression.  Similarly, when later in the book New York and Boston are described as being separated by the Hudson River, one wonders whether Kafka was sincerely ignorant of American geography or deliberately distorting it to create a dreamlike effect.  <br />Karl, a German-speaking teenager from Prague, has been sent to America by his parents to evade charges of paternity by a maidservant he has impregnated.  He is to learn English and complete his education while living with his uncle Jakob, owner of a shipping business.  Soon he is invited to the mansion of one of uncle's friends, where he is assaulted by this man's daughter and loses himself within the enormous house's labyrinth of dark corridors.  This is a typical Kafka touch -- enshrouding a normal situation with an eerie atmosphere and a sense of foreboding.<br />After Karl is expelled by his uncle over an unintended act of disrespect, he takes to the road and hooks up with two rough drifters named Delamarche and Robinson.  They proceed to bully and steal from him and eventually cause him to lose his job as a hotel elevator operator, and, when all three end up living in an apartment with an imperious fat woman named Brunelda, Karl even becomes their prisoner and slave.  These situations of helplessness and unfairness are evidence of more of Kafka's stylistic attributes -- paranoia and persecution fantasy -- which are employed to more morbid effect in \\"The Trial.\\"<br />Like much of Kafka's work, \\"Amerika\\" is uncompleted, and we are left with a potentially intriguing fragment in which Karl, having somehow escaped his state of captivity, gets a job with a roadshow organization called the Theatre of Oklahoma, which promises (but ultimately cheats us out of) further bizarre adventures into the heartland of America.  Kafka seems to imagine American showmanship as a perverse form of public spectacle; his portrayal of a street parade for the election of a judge, which Karl watches rapturously from Brunelda's balcony, is a narrative tour de force of human chaos.<br />The book's subtitle, \\"The Man Who Disappeared,\\" expresses an idea that many Europeans may have had about America -- that emigration there was a final and irrevocable abandonment of cultural roots.  But Kafka was not like many Europeans, let alone many people, and his theme can be interpreted more accurately as a descent into hell, a severance of all family ties (Karl lamentably loses his only photograph of his parents) and an immersion into the unknown.  We can only hope that Karl, having sailed across the Atlantic like the dead being ferried by Charon across the river Styx, will be lucky enough to avoid the left-hand path towards his own personal Tartarus.	2003-07-10

Some years ago I read a quote by Rabelais -- something about whether a chimera bombinating in a vacuum could devour second intentions -- and I sensed that his humor might appeal to me. \\"Gargantua and Pantagruel,\\" his literary landmark and the source of that quote, is a virtual encyclopedia of Renaissance satire that contrives a heroic epic as a backdrop for a comprehensive commentary of medieval and classical history and mythology. <br />The story, which concerns the adventures of the giant Gargantua, his son Pantagruel, and Pantagruel's friend Panurge, is completely silly; just scan the chapter titles in the table of contents for an indication. Silly, but not stupid: Rabelais is a serious scholar who has written a book that is not intended to be taken seriously. An epicure with an insatiable appetite for learning and a fascination with bodily functions, he believes that wine, scatology, and the pursuit of knowledge are inseparable. The book is all codpieces, urination, defecation, and flatulence at the service of satirizing the pedantry in the medical, legal, ecclesiastical, and academic professions as they existed in the sixteenth century. It should be noted that Rabelais's satire is generally playful and cheerful rather than bitter and mean-spirited, so the book's tone is always light even if its content is very erudite.<br />The plot, such as it is, is episodic rather than unified. Gargantua defends his country, Utopia, from invasion by King Picrochole of Lerne, in a war started by an argument between Utopian shepherds and Lernean cake-bakers; Pantagruel and Panurge then defend Utopia from invasion by Anarch, King of the Dipsodes; Panurge conducts inquiries among a variety of experts on whether or not he should get married, which leads to several discussions about cuckoldry, impotence, and cuckoldry as a consequence of impotence; and Pantagruel and Panurge, along with their monkish friend Friar John and several cohorts, embark on a sea voyage to consult the oracle of the Temple of the Bottle, visiting many strange islands and encountering many bizarre creatures along the way. As mentioned, it is of course all nonsense, but it is a definite precursor to the more farcical works of Jonathan Swift, Voltaire, Lewis Carroll, and James Joyce, and for that reason it has significant value as a ribald curiosity.	2003-06-30

Books	4	50	64	N	N	Sharecropper's opera	\\"Tobacco Road\\" is about a family of Georgia sharecroppers who are so appallingly stupid, ignorant, and cruel, they can barely be regarded as human beings.  Wretchedly poor, uneducated, living in a dilapidated house on a defunct cotton farm, unable to afford seed to grow crops, literally starving, the Lesters are both the cause and the product of their predicament.  Erskine Caldwell does not attempt to make them heroes, villains, or clowns; he simply portrays them naturally, without ideological filters over the camera lens, and leaves the crusading against agrarian capitalist exploitation to John Steinbeck.<br />Jeeter Lester, the patriarch of this dirtwater dynasty, and his wife Ada have seventeen children, but the accuracy of that number is in question since he can't even remember all of their names.  We get to meet only two of them: Ellie May, his harelipped daughter who, unmarried at age eighteen, is considered an old maid by local standards; and his teenage son Dude who has a promising future as a living scarecrow.  There is also a creepy old woman who wanders around and hides behind trees, and this, we are told, is Jeeter's mother, although it is scary to think how she could be anybody's mother, even Jeeter's.<br />But the most frightening character is Sister Bessie, a noseless woman preacher with no particular denominational affiliation who just likes to thank God for everything.  She (sort of) marries Dude and uses the money she inherited from her dead husband to buy a new Ford so they can drive around the county to preach.  The car is, in fact, more deserving of sympathy than any character in the novel because of the brutal treatment it receives at the hands of the Lesters in just the first week of ownership -- a headlight is lost, a fender is crumpled, the front axle is bent, the paint is scratched, the engine is ruined for lack of oil, the upholstery is torn, and the spare tire is hocked.  Dude's careless driving also causes two fatal accidents, but thereis some consolation in the fact that one of the fatalities is Jeeter's mother.<br />Despite his Neanderthal mentality, Jeeter does have a conscience about certain things.  It is out of an almost spiritual devotion to farming and not laziness that he refuses to earn a living by working in a cotton mill.  He has always wanted but could never afford to get Ellie May's harelip fixed so she can attract a man.  After stealing a sack of turnips from his son-in-law and endeavoring to keep them all for himself, he feels a brief pang of remorse.  And both he and Ada are distinctly modern in their irrational fears about death; not about the dying itself, but about the body's postmortem condition -- Ada hopes to have a nice dress for the coffin, and Jeeter just wants to be assured that he won't be laid to rest anywhere rats could chew off his face like one did his father's.<br />However, for the most part there is no love nor humanity among the Lesters; they are animalistically selfish and insensitive to the extent that they resemble a pack of wolves more than a human family.  In that sense, I enjoyed this novel because it's like a simpler cousin to Faulkner's \\"As I Lay Dying\\" in subject and setting.  I'm just thankful the edition I read wasn't illustrated.	2003-06-23

As the story of a boy's adolescent conscience and aspirations to become a writer, the book's only artistic peer is James Joyce's &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.&quot;<br />The narrator is presumably the young Marcel Proust who divides his recollections between his boyhood at his family's country house at Combray and his parents' friend Charles Swann, an art connoisseur.  In fact, the path that passes Swann's house, being one of two ways the narrator's family likes to take when they go for walks, gives the book its title.  Proust uses the theme of unrequited love to draw a parallel between his young narrator's infatuation with Swann's red-haired daughter Gilberte and Swann's turbulent affair with a woman named Odette de Crecy.<br />Intense romantic obsessions are a Proustian forte.  Swann falls for Odette even though she is unsophisticated and frivolous and does not appear to love him nearly as much as he loves her.  He is desperate for her, always sending her gifts, giving her money when she needs it, and hoping she will become dependent on him.  It comes as no surprise that he is consumed with jealousy when he notices her spending time with his romantic rival, the snobbish Comte de Forcheville, and he is shocked by her lesbian tendencies and rumors of her prostitution.  He finally realizes with chagrin that he has wasted years of his life pursuing a woman who wasn't his &quot;type&quot; -- but even this resignation is not yet the conclusion of their relationship.<br />Proust's extraordinary sensitivity allows him to explore uncommon areas of poignancy, perversity, and the human condition.  One example is the young narrator's childish insistence on getting a goodnight kiss from his mother at the cost of wresting her attention away from the visiting Swann.  Another remarkable instance is the scene in which a girl's female lover spits on the photograph of the girl's deceased father in disrespectful defiance of his wishes for his daughter's decency.  And I myself identified with Legrandin, the engineer whose passion for literature and art grants his professional career no advantages but makes him an excellent conversationalist.<br />Few writers can claim Proust's level of elegance and imagery.  The long and convoluted sentences, with multiple subordinate clauses tangled together like tendrils of ivy, remind me of Henry James; but Proust is much warmer and more intimate although admittedly he is just as difficult to read.  The narration of &quot;Swann's Way&quot; is a loosely connected flow of thoughts which go off on tangents to introduce new ideas and scenes; the effect is similar to wandering through a gallery of Impressionist paintings.  And, as though channeling Monet literarily, Proust displays a very poetical understanding of and communication with nature, infusing his text with pastoral motifs and floral metaphors that suggest the world is always in bloom.ion away from the visiting Swann.

US	49396726	RUHM08YAAC0SI	0802860613	103995848	Lilith	Books	5	141	143	N	N	A bridge between worlds	The arena of twentieth century British Christian fiction, which includes authors from Chesterton to Auden to C.S. Lewis, appears to owe a great deal to George MacDonald, whose Victorian fantasy as demonstrated in \\"Lilith\\" has a primitive and dark undercurrent.  Nightmarish yet optimistic, \\"Lilith\\" is possibly the most vivid life-after-death parable since Dante's Divine Comedy.<br />The protagonist and first-person narrator is an excitable man named Mr. Vane who lives in an old house that has been in his family for generations.  One day he notices an odd creature making its way through the library; this turns out to be the birdlike Mr. Raven, who introduces him to a mysterious world beyond a magic mirror stored in the garret of the house.  A more modern author might be tempted to give this world a name to distinguish it from the real one, but to MacDonald it is merely an extension of Mr. Vane's conscience.  <br />Mr. Vane is understandably frightened of but fascinated by this world.  Part of it appears to be a realm of the Dead where skeletal apparitions dance and fight as though they were still living; part a forest where stupid, brutal giants and innocent, benevolent \\"little ones\\" share their habitats; part a murky moor where leopardesses roam in search of babies to eat and enchanting women are to be found.  At the center of this world, embodying its evil, commanded by an entity known as the \\"Shadow,\\" is the demon princess Lilith, a direct allusion to the Assyrian goddess and to the legend of Adam's first wife.  <br />As a guide to this netherworld, Mr. Raven acts as a kind of Virgil to Mr. Vane's Dante; the structure of the story has a vague analogy to the sequence of Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise.  Mr. Vane's role is less clear; he could be considered a crusader against evil or an emissary of the living in the land of the dead.  However, I wouldn't want to restrict my interpretation to a religious allegory because the novel works as pure mythology, although supplementary to Judeo-Christian theology. <br />For all his antiquated, overly formal prose, MacDonald displays a very poetic sensibility for symbolism; for example, he personifies the sun as \\"he\\" and the moon as \\"she,\\" as if they were a married pair of celestial luminaries.  There is also an implied notion of a library as a gateway to the imaginations of the innumerable deceased, which is a comforting thought that connotes potential immortality through the written word.  If nothing else, \\"Lilith\\" functions as a bridge between two enduring traditions -- imaginative classic literature and twentieth century fantasy.	2003-06-11

Fortunately for us, Shakespeare specializes in ugly emotions, writing plays that exhibit man at his most shameful so we can elevate ourselves above the depths of human folly and watch the carnage with pleasure and awe.<br />In &quot;Othello,&quot; the &quot;green-eyed monster&quot; has afflicted Iago, a Venetian military officer, and the grand irony of the play is that he intentionally infects his commanding general, Othello, with it precisely by warning him against it (Act 3, Scene 3).  Iago has two grievances against Othello:  He was passed over for promotion to lieutenant in favor of the inexperienced Cassio, and he can't understand why the Senator's lily-white daughter Desdemona would fall for the black Moor.  Not one to roll with the punches, he decides to take revenge, using his obsequious sidekick Roderigo and his ingenuous wife Emilia as gears in his transmission of hatred.<br />The scheme Iago develops is clever in its design to destroy Othello and Cassio and cruel in its inclusion of the innocent Desdemona.  He arranges (the normally temperate) Cassio to be caught by Othello in a drunken brawl and discharged from his office, and using a handkerchief that Othello had given Desdemona as a gift, he creates the incriminating illusion that she and Cassio are having an affair.  Othello falls for it all, and the tragedy of the play is not that he acts on his jealous impulses but that he discovers his error after it's too late.<br />It is a characteristic of Shakespeare that his villains are much more interesting and entertaining than his heroes; Iago is proof of this.  He's the only character in the play who does any real thinking; the others are practically his puppets, responding unknowingly but obediently to his every little pull of a string.  In this respect, this is Iago's play, but Othello claims the title because he -- his nobility -- is the target.- is the target.	2003-06-09

Rabbit	The last novel in John Updike's famous tetralogy finds that life is finally winding down for Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom, as America heads into 1989 with a new President and an ever-evolving set of cultural icons and reference points.  After three decades of making mistakes -- both personal and professional -- and working like a dog, Harry is ready for retirement from his position as sales manager of the Toyota dealership his wife Janice inherited from her parents, and he and Janice are dividing their time between their native Brewer, Pennsylvania, and their new condo in Florida.  <br />Now fifty-five, Harry is besieged by the deleterious effects of aging and careless eating.  Despite his concern for the burning pains in his chest and his excessive weight, he can't stop snacking on junk food, and the consequences are nasty:  He has a mild heart attack while taking his granddaughter Judy sailing and, even after having an angioplasty, defies his doctor's advice to change his diet.  The man has never been able to control his insatiability, and we, the readers, wait patiently for the crash and burn.   <br />However, it is Harry's son Nelson who is going through the worst travails.  Having been left in charge of the car dealership and, like his father, never one for self-discipline, he has developed a cocaine habit which he finances partly by siphoning profits from the business and which makes him a danger to his wife Pru and their two children not to mention the entire Angstrom family fortune.  It is typical of Harry's impudence that his extramarital sexual activity, a subject of every Rabbit novel, this time extends to his daughter-in-law, while Nelson is trying to clean himself up at a treatment center.  <br />Updike has always fashioned Harry and Janice as a married representation of all the combined good and bad of the national ethic, a sort of warped suburban American Gothic.  At the end of the decade in which AIDS entered the public conscience and S & L scandals wracked the economy, there is something wistful about Harry's participation in a Fourth of July parade dressed as Uncle Sam, a symbol of post-Reagan America -- proud, overbearing, bloated, dying. <br />Harry as a character hasn't changed much since \\"Rabbit is Rich,\\" but his immutability is part of his appeal.  His peculiar thoughts on the practical aspects of mundane things -- a tour guide's chirpy attitude, the sexual implications of a waitress's hairstyle, the idiosyncrasies of television news anchors -- are always illuminating.  The novel is a vehicle for Updike's flowing commentary, delivered in his inimitably witty prose, on pop culture as it existed in 1989, which is still recent enough for the memories to flicker in all their pastel-highlighted tackiness.	2003-06-05

Forster is frank in his observations that such a class system has made Britain the imperial force that it is, but it also paves the way for the worst sort of elitism, which inevitably leads to hypocrisy and the creation of double standards.<br />In the novel, the upper class, the symbol of British imperialism, is represented by the Wilcox family, who own a rubber company that operates out of Nigeria; the novel's title is the name of their country manor, one of their several residences.  The father, Henry, is a trickle-down theorist who believes the great disparity of wealth between the upper and lower classes is necessary to maintain the strong economy, a sentiment that is echoed by his callous older son Charles.<br />The Wilcoxes have befriended two sisters, Margaret and Helen Schlegel, who, living modestly off their father's inheritance and not having to work, may be considered middle class.  They both are highly educated and idealistic with regard to social reform and equalizing the classes; Margaret the older and more serious, Helen the more frivolous.<br />A conflict arises when Ruth Wilcox, Henry's wife, having spent some pleasant hours and developed a special friendship with Margaret in London, informally bequeaths to her Howards End, which results in a subtle moral paradox:  This wish is not legally binding, but isn't Henry dishonoring his wife's memory by dismissing it?  The point becomes moot when Henry and Margaret, overcoming their differences of opinion, genuinely fall in love with each other and marry.<br />The lower class is represented by a young office clerk named Leonard Bast who attempts to transcend his social status by earnestly reading Ruskin and attending cultural events -- his fateful first encounter with the Schlegel sisters is at a Beethoven concert.  Although his intellectual posturing falls flat with the Schegels, they see him as a model of social change and make him their pet project.  However, it is his slatternly wife Jacky who establishes the real significance of his presence in the novel, which is to expose a blatant double standard of which Henry Wilcox freely avails himself.  <br />Forster is an excellent empathic writer, able to convey with unusual sensitivity his characters' thoughts, feelings, and motives, rivaling Edith Wharton in this skill.  He demonstrated this attribute to great effect in \\"A Room with a View,\\" but I feel \\"Howards End\\" is a triumphant improvement over its predecessor.  By using the social aspects of \\"A Room with a View\\" but eliminating the levity and the feeble attempts at comedy, he managed to construct what very well may be considered the definitive Edwardian novel.	2003-05-27

What keeps him going is an infectious cheerfulness, an almost quixotic faith in human virtue, and a devotion to the integrity of his family, even though they are often the cause of his troubles.   <br />Primrose, an Anglican minister and the father of six children, begins accumulating misfortunes from the very beginning of the novel.  Right before his eldest son George's wedding, he learns that the merchant with whom he has deposited his sizable inheritance has skipped town with all his money.  Now impecunious, he is compelled to move his family to a village where he becomes a tenant farmer under an arrogant and devious young landlord named Thornhill.  On the way, they meet an itinerant man of questionable background named Burchell who takes a liking to his daughter Sophia.<br />Life at the farm is fraught with woe, particularly with regard to money.  Both Primrose and his son Moses get cheated out of horses they are selling; his daughters lose the opportunity to secure good positions in London because of false rumors being spread about his family; after Olivia runs off with Thornhill, he pursues her and returns to find his house in flames.  When Primrose fails to pay the rent and insults Thornhill, who has spurned Olivia in favor of the very girl of whom George was deprived, he is thrown in jail.  <br />But wait, it gets worse.  Sophia is kidnapped by a ruffian; Olivia pines away in misery and dies; George, who has left home to make his own way in the world, ends up in Primrose's jail in a return considerably less dignified than that of the Prodigal Son.  Primrose, however, remains confident in the glory of Providence and decides to deliver sermons to reform the other prisoners who, unsurprisingly, initially resist his efforts.  That they eventually start taking him seriously only implies that they may be even more gullible than he is.<br />This is a picaresque novel, somewhat in the spirit of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; or &quot;Tom Jones,&quot; featuring an intentionally flawed hero who undergoes improbable adventures; and if it appears that I've given away too much of the plot, keep in mind this is a genre in which nothing is quite as it seems.  In fact, the denouement is so utterly silly and even stupid that I can't help but respect it for its brazen absurdity; it's really the only ending befitting a dupe as likeable as Primrose.	2003-05-21

His plays tend to begin with a single character delivering a soliloquy that introduces the background of the story, and he makes frequent use of a \\"deus ex machina\\" at the end in order to set things right, or as right as they can be. <br />The biggest difference between Sophocles and Euripides is their approach to tragedy.  Sophocles uses tragedy as an enhancement of nobility, an illumination of heroic dignity and grandeur; to Euripides it is just ugly, crude, and awkward, like a ketchup stain on your shirt.  Tragedy elevates the Sophoclean hero to a state of fearsome awe, but it merely reduces the Euripidean hero to an object of pity and even derision.  In this sense Euripides is more of a realist and a humanist, and therefore more modern.<br />Euripides's plays transform classical mythology not into morality lessons but into drama in a very basic, empathic mode.  He makes the most of every dramatic situation: Medea, who kills her children to punish her unfaithful husband Jason; Hector's widow Andromache, who is enslaved by Achilles's son Neoptolemus and is accused by his wife Hermione of seducing him; Ion, son of Apollo by the rape of Creusa and attendant at his temple, in a classic plot of mistaken identity; Pentheus, king of Thebes, who is murdered by frenzied Bacchantes, one of whom is his own mother; Iphigenia, who is sacrificed by her father Agamemnon to ensure Greek victory in the Trojan War.  There is a very clear path that connects Euripides with the conventions of two and a half millenia of Western literature.  He might not have been as famous or as respected as Sophocles, but he is no less important a dramatist.	2003-05-19

Like other Faulkner-influenced authors such as William Gass and Cormac McCarthy, Morrison combines an impressionistic writing style with a special folklore, which she accents with portentous and often eerie moments of magical realism and individualizes with an original voice of the American black experience.  <br />The subject of the novel is the morbidly named Dead family who, like Faulkner's Compsons and Bundrens, are entangled in a web of dynastic secrets that are revealed gradually throughout the story; their realm is not in the South but an unspecified city in Michigan.  The father, Macon, is a landlord whose prosperity is due to his inflexibility with his tenants but whose failure as a family man is due to his strictness and cruelty to his wife Ruth and their three children.  His son, who has acquired the humiliating nickname of Milkman as a result of being nursed by his mother long past the normal age, grows up to take over the family business and becomes the central character in the story. <br />Macon has a sister named Pilate who, after years of wandering around the country as a vagrant, has finally settled in a seedy neighborhood in Macon's city with her daughter and granddaughter and makes bootleg wine for a living.  Possessing several mythical attributes, Pilate is like a figure out of folk legend: Her navel disappeared at birth, she has visions of her dead father, she keeps a dead man's bones in a sack in her house and her father's only written word in a small box hanging from her earlobe, and she seems able to alter her size at will.  Macon sternly warns Milkman to keep away from her, which only adds to her mystique.   <br />The plot thickens when Milkman, who has been kept under his father's wing all his life and seeks to escape, learns about some gold hidden in a cavenear his father's boyhood farm in central Pennsylvania.  His adventure to retrieve this treasure brings him to a fascinating woman named Circe who seems as mythical as Pilate -- not only are her name, indeterminate age, witchlike aura, and her pack of golden-eyed dogs allusions to the Homeric sorceress who turns men into swine; her appearance as a lonely and disgraced matron dwelling in an abandoned decaying mansion evokes images of Miss Havisham in &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; <BR> <BR>The novel's title is not just a Biblical allusion but a clue to Milkman's obscure ancestry, and the story becomes his quest to uncover the mystery of his family's identity.  I was surprised and pleased by the ending, which seemed to be heading for emotional closure but instead builds into a crescendo of dramatic intensity and leaves the outcome ambiguous.  Such uncompromising writing makes &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; a modern classic -- on every page it refuses to conform to any standard except that of true literary quality.	2003-05-14

Despite the explicit title, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is not so much an ode to poverty and misery as it is a commentary on the increasing impact of industrialization on the fragmentation of society and on the dehumanization of education.  The result, as Dickens implies, leads to lives hollowed by the emptiness of work for work's sake and wealth for wealth's sake.   <br />The setting is Coketown, a factory town befouled by industrial smog and populated by underpaid and undereducated laborers.  The novel's most prominent character is one of the town's richest citizens, Josiah Bounderby, a pompous blowhard who owns a textile mill and a bank and whose conversation usually includes some boastful story about his impoverished childhood and the hard work that led to his present fortune.  <br />Bounderby is the commercial projection of Thomas Gradgrind, a local schoolteacher and an extraordinarily pragmatic man who instills in his students and his own children the importance of memorizing facts and figures and the iniquity of indulging in entertaining activities.  Gradgrind offers to Bounderby his son, Tom Jr., as an unwilling apprentice, and his daughter, Louisa, as an unwilling bride. <br />On the other end of the town's social scale is Stephen Blackpool, a simple, downcast man who works as a weaver at Bounderby's mill and slogs through life misunderstood and mistreated.  When he refuses to join his fellow workers in a labor uprising, he is ostracized; when he criticizes the economic disparity between Bounderby and the workers, he is fired and forced to leave town; when Bounderby's bank is robbed one night, he is suspected as the thief.  So halfway through the novel, Dickens grants his reader an interesting, albeit somewhat contrived, plot element to embellish the narrative. <br />If this novel contains a ray of sunshine, it is in Sissy Jupe, a girl abandoned by her father and adopted by Gradgrind, whose oppressive educational method nearly breaks her.  However, she grows upwith her own intuitive sense of propriety, which she uses as a tool to eject a dishonorable character from the novel.  Her strong and independent spirit will allow her to do much better in life than Louisa, who withers away in an unhappy marriage, and Tom Jr., whose boredom renders him vulnerable to temptations.     <br />Compared to his other novels, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is relatively short and straightforward and has few characters, as though Dickens felt that what he had to say was so important, it had to be said quickly and bluntly.  He is less interested in realism than in making a point, and it's really the poetic power of his prose that enables him to get away with the overbearing sentimentality and often ridiculous caricatures that accompany his poignant human truths.	2003-05-07

Consider a scene in \\"Put Out More Flags\\" (1942) in which a woman's husband has just been killed in combat and the man with whom she's been having an affair wastes no time in proposing marriage.  Her lackadaisical response to this most solemn of requests: \\"Yes, I think so.  Neither of us could ever marry anyone else, you know.\\"<br />Like Wodehouse, but with greater subtlety, Waugh finds an underlying silliness in all types of characters and sets them up to be knocked down like ducks in a shooting gallery.  In \\"Put Out More Flags,\\" he dredges up some characters from previous novels and introduces them into comic situations within the context of the incipient European war (1939-1940).  Foremost among them is Basil Seal, a thirty-six-year-old who is as unemployable as a six-year-old.  His mother tries to help him get a prestigious position in the Army, but he blows it when he unintentionally and unknowingly insults the Lieutenant-Colonel of the Bombardiers.  Fortunately, he is able to get a job with the War Department where he discovers that the secret to success is to level charges of Communism and Nazism against his (mostly) innocent friends and inform on them.<br />Basil's friends and family also make the most of war time.  Ambrose Silk, a Jewish atheist, takes advantage of his job at the Religious Department of the Ministry of Information to start a fustian periodical.  Alastair Trumpington, a pampered aristocrat, dutifully enlists as a soldier because he believes that \\"he would make as good a target as anyone else for the King's enemies to shoot at,\\" while his wife Sonia waits for him in the car outside the training camp like a mother picking up her kid at school.  Meanwhile, Basil's sister Barbara is allowing the use of their country estate as a shelter for poor people evacuating London for fear of German bombing raids; among them are a trio of insufferable brats named the Connollys who provide Basil with the fodder for an irresistible extortion scheme.<br />Waugh's great insight was the immediate recognition of the potential humor of the war's impact on the British class conflict, and therein lies his brilliance.  His books are funny, but more importantly, they're every bit as intelligent, perceptive, and well-written as any \\"serious\\" novel, whose level of social consciousness they rival.  The twentieth century needed an Evelyn Waugh, and we certainly could use one now.	2003-04-28

The closest contemporary comparison I can make is John Barth, but Davies, possibly by way of being Canadian, establishes his originality by balancing North American folk charm with a British style of sophistication. <br />The subject is the turbulent and often hilarious lives of three men whose hometown is the rural village of Deptford, Ontario.  They are Dunstan Ramsay, a history teacher, hagiographer (somebody who studies saints and sainthood), and decorated World War I veteran; the arrogant but vulnerable Percy Boyd \\"Boy\\" Staunton, a wealthy confectionery businessman, politician, and Dunstan's lifelong friend; and the pitiable Paul Dempster, whose premature birth was precipitated by his mother's injury from being hit accidentally by a snowball thrown by Staunton at Ramsay on a fateful winter day in 1908.  The event that provides the basis for the trilogy is Staunton's death sixty years later, when his Cadillac mysteriously plunges off a pier into a harbor.<br />The three novels form a complex story that is structured almost like a murder mystery but has much more psychological depth and detailed characterization and is more studious of the nature of consequences.  The first two novels, \\"Fifth Business\\" and \\"The Manticore,\\" discuss the life of Boy Staunton through the respective viewpoints of Ramsay, who tells all in an extensive, sarcastically toned report to the headmaster of the academy from which he is retiring, and Staunton's son David, now a successful criminal lawyer, who recalls his relationship with his father during a series of sessions with a Zurich psychiatrist.  <br />But it is the third novel, \\"World of Wonders,\\" in which the continuation of the story really takes flight.  This novel covers the fascinating life story of a brilliant magician and master illusionist named Magnus Eisengrim who, from humble and sordid beginnings as a carnival underling, has become famous throughout the world for his spectacular stage shows and now lives in a palatial Swiss chalet with his manager and consort, a strange woman named Liesl.  That he has enlisted Ramsay as his biographer is not his only connection to Deptford or to the events surrounding Boy Staunton's watery death. <br />Combining the themes of Ramsay's inquiries into the qualifications for sainthood, David Staunton's chimerical dreams, and Eisengrim's spellbinding but essentially mundane magic, \\"The Deptford Trilogy\\" maintains its narrative thrust by a thorough cross-pollination of ideas from reality and mythology.  The insight revealed is that every human life, real or imagined, has qualities that are mythical because none of us can personally experience everything that happens to everybody else.  This seems like an obvious precept of fiction, but it takes a marvel-minded writer like Davies to illustrate it with so much vivacity and wonder.	2003-04-24

In &quot;L'Assommoir&quot; you get to see Paris's unwashed masses as they probably looked and lived in the sweatiest, smelliest, grimiest parts of the city, from the bars to the slums to the workplaces, in the 1850's and 1860's.  Alcoholism is undeniably a theme, as indicated by the novel's title, but it is presented as a symptom of personal irresponsibility rather than of economic, political, or religious issues.  <br />The principal character is a provincial girl named Gervaise who has been living in a small, filthy apartment in a working class Paris neighborhood with her boyfriend Lantier and their two sons, the first of whom she had when she was fourteen.  Lantier runs away with another woman, leaving Gervaise to fend for herself; but soon she accepts a marriage proposal from a roofer named Coupeau.  He promises to be a good husband, swearing he never touches liquor because the stuff had killed his father.<br />Their marriage is fine at first, producing a daughter named Nana and allowing Gervaise to start her own laundry business.  But eventually things take a turn for the worse.  Coupeau injures himself at work one day and during his convalescence begins drinking with his buddies and becomes too lazy to return to work full time.  Lantier returns after several years, reconciling with Gervaise and Coupeau to the extent that he moves in with them and &quot;shares&quot; Gervaise.  The family descends into inescapable poverty as Gervaise starts her own drinking habit and neglects her business.  These acts of dissipation rub off on Nana, who grows up to be a saucy tart (to put it nicely), sleeping around for food and lodging because her parents are no longer providing.  All the while, Coupeau's petty, jealous sister and brother-in-law, the Lorilleux, rejoice at each of Gervaise's misfortunes.<br />This being a novel about the working class, we expect to see a copious display of vulgarities; but the real point of interest is Zola's apparent delight in portraying these vulgarities.  Whether describing a bloody melee in a laundry between Gervaise and a washerwoman who is taunting her about Lantier's infidelity, Gervaise and Coupeau's wedding party who gawk at exhibits in the Louvre and argue over the check at dinner, the gluttonous, sloppy feast on Gervaise's saint's day, or the &quot;emptying&quot; of Coupeau's mother's corpse, Zola is ostentatiously graphic.  He harnesses the power of pure portrayal, astutely recognizing that, in subject matter like this, reality is much more convincing than caricature.	2003-04-15

Henry Adams -- whose great grandfather was John Adams, the second American President, and whose grandfather obviously was John Quincy Adams, the sixth -- is more than just a presidential legacy; he reveals himself to be a great thinker and writer, the brilliance of his &quot;Education&quot; ensuring him a permanent place in the American canon.   <br />The book has a few attributes that distinguish it from a typical autobiography.  The most noticeable is that Adams writes in the third, not first, person.  He repeats the word &quot;education&quot; like a mantra throughout the book, referring to it in its literal, not formal, sense: the &quot;bringing up&quot;, or development, of a person's mind, manner, and outlook.  The narrative is very personal and is not, as some may expect, a rigid historical perspective, although it does offer plenty of commentary on contemporary historical and political events, from the Civil War to two presidential assassinations (Lincoln's and McKinley's, but not Garfield's) to the Industrial Revolution's impact on the American commercial landscape.<BR>  <BR>Adams writes like a novelist, and this book reads like a novel.  His lyrical prose is all the more amazing because it seems like a product of the very education he finds so evasive.  Growing up in Quincy, Massachussetts, he hated school; he even confesses that he got little to nothing out of his years at Harvard.  Always hopeful to be educated by new experiences, he serves as a secretary to his father, an ambassador, in London during the American Civil War, where he learns about diplomacy from high-ranking British politicians.  He proceeds to dabble in various arts and sciences, start a career in journalism, and become an instructor at Harvard, noting the irony of teaching while still searching for his own education.<br />Throughout the book we get a very vivid picture of Adams as an idiosyncratic mixture of humanism, modesty, shyness, erudition, and a polite sort of cynicism.  He has a rather socratic tendency to dismiss all the previous knowledge he has collected as worthless for his continuing education, resolving to start from scratch with a new source.  A curious omission in the book is the twenty-year period in which his marriage ends with his wife's suicide; perhaps this event was just too painful to write about, because it's difficult to believe that this experience could not have influenced the pursuit of his education. <br />If Adams's education can be said to have a culmination, it is in his development of a &quot;dynamic theory of history,&quot; in which he compares physical forces (gravity, magnetism) acting on a body to historical forces, produced by the conflict of the sciences (&quot;The Dynamo&quot;) against the arts (&quot;The Virgin&quot;), acting on man.

Mr. Pontellier, a successful New Orleans businessman, is thoroughly devoted to his wife Edna and sons, provides for them a high standard of living, and is generous with gifts; but he is a snob who likes to be assured that his wife isn't associating with anyone commonplace or doing anything that would lower their esteemed social status or compromise their \\"financial integrity.\\"  Edna, annoyed and estranged by his attitude, seeks solace with Madame Lebrun's good-looking but slacking son Robert; but before their relationship has a chance to turn into a full-fledged fling, he impetuously runs off to Mexico to seek some kind of employment.<br />Later, languishing at her regular residence in New Orleans, Edna socializes with her friends Madame Ratignolle and the wizened Mademoiselle Reisz while her dutiful husband is off somewhere making money.  The Reisz lady has been getting a steady stream of letters from Robert, and Edna naturally wonders with chagrin why he hasn't been writing her.  Robert does return eventually, however, and his presence now, near the end of the novel, establishes his true significance in her life: the love that \\"awakened\\" her out of a lifelong dream, a love that her husband, with all his riches, could not offer her.<br />On the surface this may sound like trite romantic fluff that, if written today, would barely raise an eyebrow; but taken in the context of the 1890's when a woman was considered to be nothing other than a wife or a potential wife, it has very deep implications about sexual revolution and the propriety of marriage as an institution.  Most appealing to me about this novel, though, is its style, which combines keen psychological insight with a sort of impressionism that anticipates Virginia Woolf.  Augmented by the steamy, swampy, Creole-spiced southern Louisiana setting, the novel achieves a fever pitch of eroticism.	2003-04-07

Collins's mastery of his material is so evident that it's difficult to argue with T.S. Eliot's opinion that this is the greatest of English detective novels. <br />The mystery concerns a sacred diamond called the Moonstone which had been stolen from a Hindu temple in India centuries prior to the novel's events and made its way from owner to owner until it finally came into the possession of a British military officer who bequeaths it to his niece, Rachel Verinder...  The diamond is delivered to Rachel on her eighteenth birthday by her cousin and suitor, Franklin Blake, at a party attended by several of Rachel's family members; but the next morning, it is discovered missing from her boudoir.  <br />Theft is suspected, and the suspects are numerous:  Besides a number of servants, including Rosanna Spearman, an abject, deformed housemaid who is enamored with Blake, Blake and Rachel herself can't be ruled out, nor can their cousin (and Blake's romantic rival) Godfrey Ablewhite, a comely young man whose charitable works belie his lecherous lifestyle.  Also present in the novel as a constant reminder that the Moonstone's ties to India are not so easily severed, are three Brahmin priests who are slyly tracking the diamond's passage throughout England using disguises and subterfuge, waiting for the right moment to retrieve it and restore it to its holy place.<br />As in \\"The Woman in White,\\" Collins uses multiple narratives to relate the events and effectively introduce a bevy of colorful characters and some surprisingly wry humor.  We hear from Gabriel Betteredge, head servant of the Verinder household, whose personal bible is \\"Robinson Crusoe\\"; the sanctimonious Miss Clack, who dispenses religious tracts like a cow gives milk; Sergeant Cuff, the reputable, meticulous police detective with a green thumb that might have been a model for future sleuths with personality quirks; and Ezra Jennings, an assistant physician with a topical and curiously valid theory about the possible role of opium in the crime.<br />Comparing this novel with \\"The Woman in White,\\" I feel that \\"The Moonstone\\" has a more satisfying ending, but its predecessor has a more interesting setup and premise.  Although Collins's plots are undeniably clever and tricky (I now dub him the King of Red Herrings), these two novels are pervaded with a certain gentility that deprives them of the level of menace one finds in the grittier American noir detective fiction that I prefer.  This is more of an observation than a criticism, however.  A mystery writer who could successfully combine Collins's prose with Raymond Chandler's style would elevate the genre to its artistic pinnacle.	2003-04-02

At the same time, his propensity to write about criminals and people with criminal hearts is nowhere more emphasized among his major novels than in this one.  There is not one character I could identify as a traditional hero, not even the semi-anonymous narrator, who relates the novel's events with the impartiality of a security camera; they are all antiheros -- a room full of Raskolnikovs.<br />The novel concerns a small band of Russian intellectuals, atheists, socialists, anarchists, and various other rabble who are distributing subversive leaflets in an attempt to incite the proletariat to revolt against the government.  They are a motley group, destined to fail because they lack general competence, organizational skills, a clear agenda, definite plans, and even uniform ideas.  The only thing they have in common is that they don't like the way things currently are in Russia and intend to change them, violently if necessary.<br />Among this group we meet Nicholas Stavrogin, an obnoxious, insensitive young man who is only looking out for himself and is not above having affairs with his friends' wives.  The group's prime mover and instigator is Peter Verkhovensky, whose father Stepan had been Nicholas's tutor and is still living platonically with Nicholas's widowed mother, one of the wealthier citizens of the town in which the novel takes place.  The group's rank-and-file who figure most prominently into the plot include the suicidal Kirilov, a former member (and potential informer) named Shatov who just wants to put it all behind him, a useless drunkard named Lebyatkin who acts as the group's stooge, and an escaped convict named Fedka who becomes the group's henchman.  <br />That many of these people are dead by the end of the novel is not as surprising as how they get that way.  The plot is built around intrigues, disloyalties, and the type of drawing-room confessions and revelations that characterize the best mysteries.  It's not difficult to guess that there is a juicy secret about Lebyatkin's crippled, mentally disturbed sister Mary, or that the elegant fete arranged by Julia Lembke, the Governor's wife, will culminate in a spectacular, outrageous, and perhaps deadly climax; Dostoevsky likes sensationalism and never misses a chance to use human frailty and folly as hosts upon which the morally hollow feed like parasites.<br />Dostoevsky's description of these men as \\"devils\\" is a biblical allusion to the book of Luke, translating Christ's power to drive the devils out of a possessed man into a herd of swine to the cleansing of Russia of its nefarious political elements.  It would appear that \\"The Devils\\" is Dostoevsky's effort to demonize the soulless, devilish radicals who have no moral underpinnings and who would replace everything he considers good about Russia (namely, the Eastern Orthodox Church) with Western ideas.  There is an obvious parallel to the Bolshevik Revolution of nearly half a century later, which shows that such Socialist sentiment had been bubbling under the Russian mainstream for many years prior to its twentieth century emergence.  In that sense, this is a prescient novel of historical and political interest.	2003-03-26

The purpose of this book, which can be considered a companion to the acclaimed television series, is to explain what we know about the universe from a cosmological perspective and why we need to know more about it.<br />Physicists often talk of the unity of the branches of physics: the interrelation and application of mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, and optics to the motion of everything from galaxies to subatomic particles.  Similarly, Sagan's major theme is the unity of cosmology with the natural and physical sciences that define what we know about the Earth.  Does the stifling, carbon dioxide-choked atmosphere of Venus imply anything about the greenhouse effect on Earth?  Was a nearby cosmic explosion called a supernova indirectly responsible for the disappearance of the dinosaurs?  What would be the biological consequences for the survivors of a global nuclear war?  The answers to these questions are vital to the continuation of life as we know it.  <br />Sagan also identifies cosmology with its own history.  He lavishes reverent detail on the ancient Greek and Alexandrian study of the stars and planetary motions, the pioneering work by the Renaissance scientists Brahe, Kepler, Copernicus, Huygens, and others, and the men who revolutionized science with the formulation of laws of motion, Newton and Einstein.<br />The scope of &quot;Cosmos&quot; is tremendous, from the farthest expanses of the universe containing a hundred billion galaxies in addition to our own Milky Way, at the end of a spiraling arm of which our solar system is located; down to the lone electron circling the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, the most plentiful single entity in the cosmos and the source of everything weknow, love, and are.  In between there is discussion of the unmanned spacecraft expeditions to investigate &quot;our&quot; planets: Mars with its boulder-strewn, desert-like terrain; the gaseous giant Jupiter; Io, a Jovian moon of incredible redness, spotted with volcanic orifices and resembling an unappealing sauce-covered meatball; Saturn with its ice rings.  Would these worlds contain life?  Using what we know about the evolution of life on Earth, Sagan hypothesizes how different types of lifeforms might develop on worlds with different environments.  <br />Even a casual interest in cosmology requires a fascination with astronomical distances and unthinkably long spans of time in which a human lifetime is but a blink of an eye.  However, Sagan seems to write also for those who would rather relate cosmic arcana to familiar terms, and in this sense he is a grand entertainer:  A thought experiment that provides a simple but fanciful illustration of the concept of black holes uses the tea party scene in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; as a setting.  &quot;Cosmos&quot; neither complicates unnecessarily nor insults your intelligence; very few &quot;popular&quot; science books will capture your imagination so well.	2003-03-19

The one day in which the entire novel takes place completely encapsulates his past, present, and future into the portrait of a man mired in his environment.<br />The man is 44-year-old Tommy Wilhelm who, like some of Bellow's other fictional protagonists Augie March, Eugene Henderson, and Moses Herzog, is a little piece of the chaos of twentieth-century urban America distilled into a single confused character.  Wilhelm is a native New Yorker (although it's obvious his author is not), a failed actor, and an unemployed former sales executive.  He is separated from his wife, who is always selfishly demanding from him money that he doesn't have, and his two sons.  His only financial support now is from his father, a successful physician who is annoyed by his son's lack of discipline but nevertheless brags about his past accomplishments to anyone who will listen.<br />Wilhelm has a friend named Dr. Tamkin who professes to be a psychologist, has many various interests but dubious talents, and persuades him to invest his last dollar in lard commodities.  Tamkin, a world traveler, has told Wilhelm that he \\"had attended some of the Egyptian royal family as a psychiatrist,\\" a statement that evokes an image of the biblical Joseph prophesying for the Pharaoh seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine; but Tamkin's optimistic expectation for lard is all profit, no loss.  His philosophy is that the future is not worth the worry; live for the \\"here-and-now\\": seize the day.  He is undoubtedly a charlatan, but in Wilhelm's eyes he means well.<br />One of the novel's themes is atonement, which is signified by the reference to Yom Kippur.  Wilhelm is not very religious and has notplanned to attend a synagogue, but he recognizes the importance of saying Yiskor for his dead mother; his sincere but idle threat to the unknown hoodlums who vandalized the bench next to her grave will not suffice to honor her memory.  Ironically, the place where he ultimately atones is the funeral of a man who is evidently not Jewish (open casket, presence of flowers) -- and he weeps with the knowledge that death is all we achieve from life.  Seize the day, indeed.	2003-03-17
US	49396726	R3AR4DALZLDBT2	0684843323	156249009	The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vigia Edition	Books	5	10	13	N	N	Hemingworld	Hemingway's writing is a grand example of stylistic dichotomy:  His prose is as austere and utilitarian as a barn, yet his stories, unique and instantly recognizable as his own, pound with energy, drama, and almost excessive bravado.  He wastes no time on literary pretension and gets right down to business; writing, drinking, and living life to the fullest are inextricably entwined, and nothing matters more than a well-worded and well-placed line of dialogue.   <br />Hemingway's subject matter is easy to summarize: he writes about the things he actively enjoys.  His short stories cover safaris, hunting, fishing, the outdoors (&quot;Big Two-Hearted River&quot;), boating, horse racing (&quot;My Old Man&quot;), bullfighting (&quot;The Undefeated&quot;), boxing (&quot;Fifty Grand&quot;), war, lowlife crime (&quot;The Killers&quot;), even a couple of fairy tales.  Basically, Hemingway can turn anything adventurous and daring into reading material for the armchair weekend warrior.  With a few exceptions, the stories take place either in the plains of Africa, throughout war-torn European countries, or in and around Michigan.  <br />While some of the stories profess nothing more than pure narration, the recreational activities of the characters usually serve as a backdrop against which they face private conflicts or ethical dilemmas.  Realism is emphasized, and only &quot;Cat in the Rain&quot; can be said to have a conventional happy ending, albeit one that glosses over the heroine's real problems.  Hemingway is more interested in the seedy side of life, portraying people on the fringes of society: vagabonds, smugglers, expatriates.  An important distinction about his war stories is that he tends to write not about soldiers, but about fighters -- individualistic rebels who are compelled by the strength of their political convictions and revel in the camaraderie on and off the battlefield, often with a bottle of fine wine.<br />The two stories that bookend this collection are indicative of the diversity of Hemingway's thematic repertoire.  The title character of &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot; exposes his cowardice to his wife and loses the real trophy -- her love -- to their safari guide, even while regaining his dignity in a final effort that is too little, too late.  Hemingway appears to reflect himself in &quot;The Strange Country,&quot; in which an acclaimed cosmopolitan writer takes a cross-country road trip with a much younger girl in a series of vignettes that contrasts the comfort of American domesticity with the imminent dangers of pre-World War II Europe.  This is the ultimate expression of Hemingway's restlessness:  The world was too small to contain him; life was too slow to keep up with him.	2003-03-13

The typical Chandler elements remain unchanged:  The women are glamorous and lusty, the gangsters are ruthless but businesslike, the cops are just like the gangsters except they get to carry badges, and Marlowe always stands up to them even when they're beating him down.<br />The novel begins with Marlowe's recollection of his brief but close friendship with a man named Terry Lennox, an alcoholic socialite with an apparently war-scarred past and an unfaithful wife who happens to be the daughter of one of the country's richest men.  One day Lennox shows up at Marlowe's house and asks him to drive him to Mexico; Marlowe concedes, and upon returning finds out that Lennox's wife has been murdered.  Soon Lennox is reported to have committed suicide after sending Marlowe a &quot;portrait of Madison.&quot;<br />Some time later, Marlowe is contacted by a book publisher with a request to &quot;babysit&quot; a man named Roger Wade, a popular writer of trashy novels, who has a penchant for violent drinking binges and tends to disappear for days at a time.  Marlowe is uninterested in the job at first, but after Wade's stunningly beautiful wife Eileen hires him to find her missing husband, he becomes enmeshed in their affairs.  As one of Chandler's best and most poignant character creations, Roger Wade exudes the ironic misery of a man who hates his life because he's so successful making a living at something he finds contemptible.<br />Are the Lennox and Wade cases connected?  If you've read &quot;Farewell, My Lovely,&quot; you know that Chandler has a way of tying together plot strands like ribbons around a Christmas present.  The difference in &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; is that Chandler tries to embellish the cleverly twisted plots of his concise earlier novels with longer, more grandiose storytelling and character development, and the result is merely a book that takes longer to read.  This is not to say the end is unsatisfying, but it doesn't come as much of a surprise to a Chandler veteran who's intimately familiar with the man's style.g together plot strands like ribbons around a Christmas present.

Romance, deceit, misunderstanding, and misfortune affect their destinies, and those to whom the novel is cruelest come to tragic ends because they refuse to forgive themselves or others for mistakes.<br />The central tragic figure is Eustacia Vye, a young woman who has come to live on Egdon Heath with her cantankerous grandfather. Despising the dreariness of the heath and generally secluding herself from the local populace, she is somewhat of an outsider and not well liked by some in the community. She was in love with Damon Wildeve, a former engineer who now owns an inn and is not too happy about it; but their affair has since cooled and Wildeve has turned his attention to a girl named Thomasin Yeobright. Wildeve and Thomasin's wedding is aborted when the marriage license turns out to be invalid, and Thomasin, running home to her aunt in shame and anger, is caught on the rebound by Diggory Venn, her long-time admirer. A word about Venn's profession is in order: He is a \\"reddleman,\\" who, not unlike the ice cream man in the summertime, rides around the heath in a van selling a strange product that shades its vendor most memorably.<br />Completing the quintet is Thomasin's cousin Clym Yeobright, an Egdon Heath native who is returning permanently after living for some time in Paris as a diamond merchant. Destiny eventually unites Clym and Eustacia in love, but Clym's mother does not approve of the union; she doesn't like Eustacia, and she fears their being married would prevent or discourage Clym from returning to his lucrative career in Paris. They get married anyway, as do Wildeve and Thomasin on a second try, leaving Venn as the fifth wheel but still not out of the running.<br />The catalyst for the tragedy of the novel involves an attempted reconciliation between Clym's mother and Eustacia, which results in the kind of ugly situation that could be cleared up by simple explanations and apologies but instead is exacerbated by normal circumstances. On top of this, Wildeve realizes he still loves Eustacia and is willing to help her in any course of action, no matter how lacking in judgment, that she thinks is an appropriate response to her plight.<br />This novel swells with Hardy's typical narrative genius, but no less impressive than the plot, the characters, the dialogue, and the prose, is the barren but hauntingly beautiful setting of Egdon Heath. Like the famous Casterbridge of his later novel, it is a world unto itself, defined by its own peculiar topography and populated by denizens who, with their own special jargon, customs, and folklore, act as a sort of Greek chorus towards the drama of the principal characters, commenting on events with humor and gravity. The heathmen and women don't much mind the hardships of life; they're the kind of people that will joyfully dance around their bonfires on the barrows even without musical accompaniment.	2003-02-24

What I found in Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, however, was a smart, resolute, and independent heroine who stands out like a beacon in a sea of Victorian fictional women.  As if obeying some sort of literary convention, the book does have a sad beginning and a happy ending, but in between there are some very rich surprises: moments of mystery, tension, and ghostly images, delivered in a tightly paced narrative.<br />Jane Eyre is an orphan who has spent the first ten years of her life with a mean aunt who mistreats her and the next eight years at a miserable school for indigent girls called Lowood.  With this education, she qualifies herself as a teacher and secures a position as a governess at a house called Thornfield Hall.  Her employer is a man twice her age named Edward Rochester, and her charge is his ward, a little girl of French parentage named Adele.<br />Given that Jane soon falls in love with him, it might be guessed that Rochester is a dashing, noble, gallant gentleman; but no:  He is unattractive, eccentric, shifty, assumes disguises, and rarely gives a straight answer to a question.  These might merely be manifestations of a quirky, enigmatic personality, or maybe he is so evasive because he is hiding something from his past -- as indeed he is, and that \\"something,\\" incriminating and dangerous, is locked up in Thornfield Hall, unknown to Jane and most of the servants.<br />Rochester falls in love with Jane, too, despite his apparent attention to a conceited society woman named Blanche Ingram.  After a short courtship and a marriage proposal, however, Jane breaks off with him when she discovers his secret.  Abandoning Thornfield Hall for a new life, she meets a young parson named St. John Rivers who is planning to go to India to do missionary work and would like to marry her because he thinks she too would make a good missionary.  Thus, she has had to reject two men in her life: the first because he was not honest with her and made her feel used and deceived; the second because he is not looking for a wife, but a co-worker.<br />Jane is not foolish, but she is human.  That she returns to Rochester does not mean she has decided to accept his faults, but that she realizes they have developed that special kind of mutually dependent relationship that only two people who are truly in love may foster.  By the end of the novel, Rochester loses a great deal because of his mistakes, and Jane's love is his only redemption; Jane, on the other hand, gains much because of the strength of her character, and Rochester's love is the fulfillment of her desire.s planning to go to India to do missionary work and would like to marry her because he thinks she too would make a good missionary.

His daughter Isabel marries a local man, Wilbur Minafer; their son George (named after his carefree, jovial uncle, who is never fazed by disappointments) proceeds to become the novel's central character.<br />An only child, and the Major's only grandchild, George Amberson Minafer is, not surprisingly, spoiled rotten by his parents and grandparents, who condone his misbehavior and refuse him nothing.  He grows up conceited, arrogant, pugnacious, rude, and demanding -- in other words, he is perfectly poised to inherit the executive responsibilities of whatever his grandfather's business is, except that he has no interest in business, nor any professional aspirations at all.  He expects to spend the rest of his life as a proud member of the idle rich, and has no qualms about provoking the envy and animosity of the townspeople, whom he terms \\"riffraff.\\"  <br />The novel's drama is augmented by the introduction of a widowed automotive pioneer named Eugene Morgan, who was once Isabel Amberson's suitor and attracts George's naive, fragile aunt Fanny.  George doesn't like the guy from first sight and scoffs at his entrepreneurial efforts, even while he is going out with his pretty daughter, Lucy.  While Morgan turns his dreams of a lucrative automobile business into reality, George and the Ambersons discover that their finances are depleting as the changing industrial and commercial trends gradually expel them from the elite of the growing city.  However, Tarkington saves the novel from becoming a Dreiseresque descent into despair and misery by offering a sympathetic reprieve to his beleaguered protagonist at the end.<br />This is the kind of story that could have been expanded into a massive multi-volume epic, but Tarkington wisely avoids unnecessary detail, minor characters, and subplots, retains the core elements that define the personalities of the main characters, and yields a succinct novel that feels complete and comprehensive.  It is a novel with a formula, to be sure: a sort of Horatio Alger in reverse; but Tarkington measures the impact carefully with taste and restraint.	2003-02-05

Written in 1920 but set primarily in the 1870's, Edith Wharton's &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; is a novel of nostalgia, recalling its author's memories of what New York high society was like in a time when the industrial age had raised the standard of living to indulgent levels of comfort but before twentieth-century technologies had made life faster, busier, and noisier; a world where balls, formal dinners, and the opera were the main events and the lower classes were visible only as servants.  Into this setting Wharton fashions an elegant story about a young man caught between his fiancee and the woman he believes he loves even more.<br />Newland Archer, a junior partner in a prominent law firm, is engaged to marry May Welland who, like Archer, comes from one of the many respected upper middle class New York families.  However, Archer takes an interest in May's cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska, who has just separated from her wealthy aristocrat husband in Europe and plans to settle in New York.  Ellen bears the burden of possibly causing a scandal in her family if her separation results in divorce, and she is already raising eyebrows by consorting with Julius Beaufort, a married banker.  Archer gradually falls in love with Ellen and wishes to whisk her away to a place where they can escape the scrutiny of reproachful eyes; May, sensing that his romantic interests may lie elsewhere than with her, even suggests that he should follow his heart.  Loyal to societal conventions and propriety, however, he marries May but remains passionate about Ellen, whose presence in New York is a constant reminder of his sacrifice.<br />Lurking beneath the plot are implications about the many social and cultural differences between America and Europe.  Archer has a taste for literature, and since America at that time did not have much of a body of literature or even an identifiable culture for that matter, everything he reads is imported from Europe.  Part of his attention to Ellen is due to her connection to and representation of the rich culture of Europe, while May, for all her wholesome goodness, represents to him the dull conventionality that is so much a part of the uncultured New York.

Jose Saramago is Portugese, but &quot;Baltasar and Blimunda&quot; shows that he is very much part of this esteemed group.<br />The novel takes place in Portugal in the early eighteenth century.  An ex-soldier named Baltasar &quot;Sete-Sois&quot; (Seven Suns) Mateus arrives in Lisbon in 1711 looking for work.  His options are limited, as he has lost his left hand in battle and replaced it with a hook, which qualifies him for employment in a slaughterhouse.  He meets and falls in love with a girl named Blimunda, whose mother, accused of heresy by the Inquisition, has been banished to Africa.  Blimunda purports to having some strange powers: She can look inside people's souls and even collect their &quot;wills&quot;, a skill which will prove invaluable later in the novel.  <br />Baltasar and Blimunda befriend a learned and mechanically-minded Brazilian priest named Padre Bartolomeu Lourenco, who is something of a flight pioneer.  He convinces Baltasar to help him build a flying machine called the Passarola, which, he envisions, would be powered by a complex system of components including human &quot;wills&quot; that Blimunda, conveniently enough, is able to collect.  That the Passarola is a ludicrously unfeasible contraption does not stop it from flying fortunately, for it allows its makers to escape angry Inquisitors.<br />Meanwhile, the King of Portugal, Dom Joao, anxious for a royal heir, is making a deal with a Franciscan friar to donate money for a new convent if the Queen, Dona Maria Ana, will deliver, so to speak.  The Queen makes good on this several times over, so the King buys land from some farmers, one of whom happens to be Baltasar's father, and construction of the new convent is begun.As a source of boastful pride and a symbol of the overt alliance between the Church and the Crown, the convent turns into a Tower-of-Babel-like project, a ruthless shedder of blood, sweat, and tears.<br />Calling &quot;Baltasar and Blimunda&quot; a love story -- even a brilliant one -- is not giving it full credit.  Saramago incorporates real historical figures and events into the plot, such as the Italian harpsichordist Domenico Scarlatti who emigrates to Lisbon; and, apparently, a priest named Lourenco really did build a working flying machine.  (Of course, it's unlikely that Lourenco and Scarlatti actually ever met, but for the purpose of fiction, that possibility needs to be milked for all it's worth.)  Saramago's prose is like a stiletto wrapped in silk; his sardonic tone offers wry observations on the disparities between royalty and peasantry and the cruelty and pageantry of the Church at the time.  Yet, in one of the most beautiful and bittersweet endings I've ever read in any novel, he reminds his reader that love is the ultimate sovereign.	2003-01-20

Writing this in 1722, Defoe casts himself into the role of his uncle whom he calls H.F. and who recounts the events in grisly detail but with magnanimous compassion.  Aside from the prose, the book has a surprisingly modern edge in the way it combines facts about a sensationally dire historical event with \\"human interest\\" stories for personal appeal.  It seems so factual that at times it's easy to forget that it's just a fictitious account of a real event. <br />The plague (H.F. writes) arrives by way of carriers from the European mainland and spreads quickly through the unsanitary, crowded city despite official preventive measures; the symptoms being black bruises, or \\"tokens,\\" on the victims' bodies, resulting in fever, delirium, and usually death in a matter of days.  The public effects of the plague are readily imaginable: dead-carts, mass burial pits, the stench of corpses not yet collected, enforced quarantines, efforts to escape to the countryside, paranoia and superstitions, quacks selling fake cures, etc.  Through all these observations, H.F. remains a calm voice of reason in a city overtaken by panic and bedlam.  By the time the plague has passed, purged partly by its own self-limiting behavior and partly by the Great Fire of the following year, the (notoriously inaccurate) Bills of Mortality indicate the total death toll to be about 68,000, but the actual number is probably more like 100,000 -- about a fifth of London's population.<br />Like Defoe's famous survivalist sketch \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" the book's palpable moralism is adequately camouflaged by the conviction of its narrative and the humanity of its narrator, a man who, like Crusoe, trusts God's providence to lead him through the hardships, come what may.  What I like about this \\"Journal\\" is that its theme is more relevant than its narrow, dated subject matter suggests: levelheadedness in the face of catastrophe and the emergence of a stronger and wiser society.	2003-01-15

That their hero Titus Groan, the seventy-seventh earl of Gormenghast, is not even two years old by the end of the first novel is indicative of Peake's willingness to take his time telling a story in meticulous detail.  <br />Evidently modeled on Victorian (or earlier) England, the Gormenghast milieu is an insular place, completely disconnected from the rest of whatever world in which it resides.  The castle that is its centerpiece is so large and ancient it is gradually crumbling under the enormous weight of its own monstrous sprawling architecture, a ghastly monument to the dozens of generations and hundreds of years of the Groan hereditary line.  (Imagine an Edward Gorey illustration stretching for miles in every direction.)  The interior is a labyrinth of cryptic rooms and dark corridors, a network so intricate a dead body could remain undiscovered for years.   <br />Living catatonically in abstract worlds of their own interests, the elder Groan family seem like products of their dreary environment.  Titus's father, Lord Sepulchrave (Earl no. 76), is immersed in his extensive library filled with erudite books of undisclosed content; his mother Gertrude is a walking cat magnet and bird sanctuary; his spacey sister Fuchsia is fated to live an idle, vacuous life.  Providing comic relief are Sepulchrave's brainless, prattling sisters Cora and Clarice, who are jealous of Gertrude and crave &quot;power,&quot; which to them merely means getting to sit on a throne.     <br />As in a Dickens novel, there are several interrelated plot threads weaving the various dramatic conflicts into an ugly but delicate web of palace intrigue.  The villain who drives much of the action is a dangerously ambitious servant named Steerpike, the Uriah Heep of Gormenghast, who works his way up from the kitchen to become master of castle ceremonies by ingratiation, subterfuge, and violence -- a thoroughly menacing presence among the castle's more eccentric but benevolent inhabitants.  <br />The third novel, &quot;Titus Alone,&quot; changes the setting as Titus, rebelling against his title and all the meaningless ceremonial rites that accompany it, decides to set out to see the world, a world that turns out to be more modern than Gormenghast but every bit as fantastical and even weirder.  Here Titus's adventures become almost a parody of the events at Gormenghast (and, at the climax, this parody is intentional on the part of Titus's new antagonist, a beautiful femme fatale), but the mood is always nightmarish, the machinations of the characters diabolical.      <br />The &quot;Gormenghast&quot; novels may be interpreted as a parody of British aristocratic heraldry, amplifying its gluttony and reflecting its impracticality; but they are definitely fantasy literature in the truest sense because they defy genre (although &quot;Titus Alone&quot; might be considered borderline science fiction).  Classification issues aside, the elegance of Peake's prose and the power of his imagery instill the novels with the kind of artistry that characterizes the great literary works of the ages.  We close the book thinking Gormenghast would be a nice place to visit, but we don't blame Titus for not wanting to live there.	2003-01-03

Abbott's &quot;Flatland&quot; is one of the most curious in literature: a two-dimensional world in which all the inhabitants are sentient flat shapes which slide around on a plane with no knowledge or conception of a third dimension.  However, the book's theme -- the importance of unimpeded scientific inquiry and the danger of denying the possibilities of infinity in all its forms -- is treated with the didacticism of a tendentious theological tract, leaving the reader, who probably was already well aware of the book's implications long before he even heard of the book, gasping for breath.<br />We are introduced to the nature of Flatland by the narrator, a nameless Square, who describes his world as being populated primarily by regular polygons.  A citizen's social and occupational status is in direct proportion to his number of sides, so those with so many sides that they approximate circles achieve the highest ranks.  These circular elite are dubbed &quot;priests&quot; and rule Flatland apparently on a parliamentary model.  At the other end of the spectrum are the Triangles, who constitute the working class.  Even lower than the Triangles, however, are the simpleminded Lines -- and these are Flatland's women, useful only for procreation.  It takes little imagination to guess what the irregular polygons represent.<br />The Square's purpose in writing this report is to rejoice in his discovery of the (previously unimagined) third dimension, revealed to him by a helpful Sphere who visits from Spaceland.  The Square, now in possession of arcane knowledge and an intuitive conviction of the existence of higher dimensions, assumes an evangelical role and ultimately emerges as a Promethean figure when he is imprisoned for the heretical act of preaching a third dimension. <br />&quot;Flatland&quot; has been compared to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Gulliver's Travels,&quot; but I'd say there are clearer parallels to Huxley's&quot;Brave New World&quot; (in the classist regimentation of the Flatlanders' society) and Samuel Butler's &quot;Erewhon&quot; (in the Flatlanders' strange and limited belief system).  The difference is that the aforementioned novels employ both irony to qualify as allegorical satires and narrative integrity to endure as pure fiction, whereas &quot;Flatland&quot; is so earnest in its delivery and so ineffectual in its impact, it feels like a pebble in an avalanche.  Too obvious and elementary to be a scientific or mathematical essay, too obtuse to be a philosophical treatise, too moralistic to be a good example of a novel, &quot;Flatland&quot; misses its mark and slips silently through the cracks.	2002-12-24

The point of figurative language is not to veil the message but to elevate it from the mundane and create fresh new worlds of images and perspectives.  <br />Bruno Schulz not only understood this concept but was one of its greatest practitioners.  In his short but incredibly rich \\"The Street of Crocodiles,\\" summer has a \\"senile intemperance...[a] lustful and belated spurt of vitality,\\" rays of August heat form a \\"flaming broom,\\" the moon acquires \\"milky reflexes, opaline shades, and the glaze of enamel,\\" a cockroach's sudden emergence from a crevice is described as \\"a crazy black zigzag of lightning,\\" and newly hatched baby birds are \\"lizards with frail, naked bodies of hunchbacks...[a] dragon brood.\\"  Every page of this magnificently odd little book is filled with such gems.<br />Not quite a novel, but more than just a collection of stories, \\"The Street of Crocodiles\\" is a set of loosely connected chapters about Schulz's boyhood in the small Polish town of Drogobych in the earliest years of the twentieth century.  His use of figurative language instills his recollections with a dreamlike quality that hovers between reality and fantasy, such as in the chapter entitled \\"Cinnamon Shops,\\" where the young Schulz's errand home to get money for his family waiting at the theater becomes an exotic journey into the intersection of his mind and the city.  In \\"Nimrod,\\" Schulz writes about the puppy he adopts and its delicate, meticulous process of learning about its environment.  But the central episode would have to be \\"Tailors' Dummies,\\" in which Schulz's eccentric father declaims eloquently on the relationships between God and Man, and Man and Mannequin.<br />Beautifully translated into English by Celina Wieniewska, this book belongs on every shelf of intelligent bizarre fiction next to the likes of Kafka, Borges, and Thomas Mann.	2002-12-16

Lawrence introduces a character to echo his own feelings about love and the world.  This character is Rupert Birkin, a misanthrope who thumbs his nose defiantly at any and all social conventions and has few, if any, likeable qualities.  It is this man with whom Ursula Brangwen, the individualistic heroine from \\"The Rainbow,\\" falls in love, but even she is not blind to his disagreeableness.  <br />Ursula, now 26 years old, teaches in the school of her coalmining hometown, Beldover.  In the first scene in the novel where she and Rupert, a school inspector, reveal their mutual acquaintance, they are standing in front of her class, transforming her botanical lecture into a wellspring of sexual innuendo in what appears to be Lawrence's playful attempt at provoking the censors who prudishly criticized his prior work.  Also participating in this scene is Hermione Roddice, a haughty aristocratic woman who harbors a secret desire to humiliate and control men, specifically the headstrong Rupert.<BR>  <BR>Meanwhile, Ursula's prettier and more vivacious younger sister Gudrun, an artist, is attracted to Gerald Crich, heir to the seemingly cursed Crich coal dynasty.  Almost the opposite of Rupert, Gerald is a proud, practical, and conscientious businessman who lays down the law with his coal miners and is cruel to his animals, feeling he deserves nothing less than unconditional obedience.  The provocative nature of this novel is that Gerald is attracted to Rupert -- socially, physically, sexually -- possibly because he considers Rupert a symbol of liberation from the workaday world he is secretly tired of; and this feeling is readily reciprocated.  In a scene where the two men strip and wrestle, Lawrence provides the male counterpart to the lesbian scene in \\"The Rainbow,\\" as though to say what's good for the goose is good for the...well, you know.<br />The novel basically tracks the trajectories of the love/hate relationships of these two couples.  While Ursula and Rupert eventually find compatibility, having in common their rugged individualism, Gerald and Gudrun drift towards a dysfunctional state of potential violence, as he realizes with jealousy and anger that her artistic world is closed to him.  <br />Lawrence's strength is not tight little plots but character study, and the great achievement in \\"Women in Love\\" is that the characters do not exhibit any stereotypical or easily describable behavior; it's difficult to pinpoint their personalities from just one conversation, and not much easier even over the course of the entire novel.  Ursula, Gudrun, Rupert, and Gerald are fascinatingly, almost frighteningly, complex people whom Lawrence seems deliberately to have designed to leave the reader at a loss, to test the reader's tolerance for sexual and psychological perversity.	2002-12-06

Such a premise has shades of Orwell and Koestler, but the difference is that Shao Bin, Ha Jin's protagonist, is fighting not an abstract, intangible political system but a personal battle with three specific men who are trying to grind him down.<br />Bin lives with his wife and baby daughter in a miserably cramped apartment near the fertilizer plant where he is employed in maintenance.  An artist at heart, his underlying passions are poetry, painting, and calligraphy, the latter at which he excels despite his limited formal education.  When Liu and Ma, the Communist Party officials who run the plant, turn down his demands for better living arrangements for his family, he takes revenge by drawing them in a satirical cartoon which he sends to a newspaper.  <br />Bin believes this simple act of dissent will support his cause, but in reality it initiates a cycle of retaliation in which Liu and Ma's immediate supervisor Yang, unsympathetic to Bin's plight, also becomes a target of the mudslinging campaigns.  The Party officials' attempts to silence Bin by subjecting him to any kind of humiliation and psychological warfare they can orchestrate only make him more determined.  Inspired by verses from a time when Chinese poets were more free to express themselves artistically without fear of government reprisal, he perseveres in his quest to make things better for himself and his family.<br />Ha Jin could have ended this novel similar to the way Bernard Malamud ends \\"The Fixer,\\" in which the hero loses materially but achieves at least a moral victory over his evil oppressors.  However, Jin chooses a more subtle and ironic path by showing that Bin, far from trying to destroy his antagonists and all they represent, is happy to become one of them in a compromising lateral move that benefits everybody.  \\"In the Pond\\" effectively illustrateswhy bureaucracy survives in every type of society and political system:  It knows how to withstand criticism and protect itself from intrusion and sabotage.	2002-11-25

While it uses the modernist experimentation that characterized \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" it is very easy to follow, but still invites several rereadings to explore its depths more fully.    <br />The novel takes place on a single day in June of 1939 at an English country manor called Pointz Hall, owned by the Olivers, a family with such sentimental ties to its ancestry that a watch that stopped a bullet on an ancient battlefield is deemed worthy of preservation and exhibition.  Every year about this time, the Olivers allow their gardens to be used by the local villagers to put on a pageant for raising money for the church.  This year, the pageant is supposed to be a series of tableaux celebrating England's history from Chaucerian times up to the present.<br />The Olivers themselves are tableaux of sorts, each a silent representation of some emotion separated from the others by a wall of miscommunication.  Old Bartholomew Oliver and his sister, Lucy Swithin, both widowed, are now living together again with much the same hesitant relationship they had as children.  Oliver's son Giles is a stockbroker who commutes to London and considers the pageant a nuisance he has no choice but to suffer.  Isa, his discontented wife, feels she has to hide her poetry from him and contemplates an extramarital affair with a village farmer.<br />Attending the pageant is a garrulous woman named Mrs. Manresa, who is either having or pursuing an affair with Giles.  She has brought with her a companion named William Dodge, whose effeminate sexual ambiguity is noticed with reprehension by Giles and with curiosity by Isa.  The somewhat romantic interest Isa shows in Dodge implies that she knows Giles would be annoyed less by her infidelity than by his being cuckolded for a fop like Dodge.  <br />The other principal character is not an Oliver at all, and this is Miss La Trobe, the harried writer and director of the pageant.  At first, she appears to serve the mere purpose of comic diversion, as she frustrates herself over details that nobody in the audience notices anyway; however, when the pageant is over, a new aspect of her character is revealed, one that has made her an outcast among the village women.  Nevertheless, she graciously accepts the role of a struggling, misunderstood woman artist, and in this sense, she echoes the character of Lily Briscoe in \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" as does Isa with her repressed poetry.<br />At the end of the pageant, to celebrate the \\"present,\\" Miss La Trobe has planned something special and startling:  She has the players flash mirrors onto the audience as if to say, \\"Look what England has become.  Shameful, isn't it?\\"  Likewise, with this novel Woolf holds up a mirror to humanity, reflecting our unhappiness in her characters.  It's not a cheerful notion, but it's a fitting one to sum up the career of a writer like Woolf, one of our greatest chroniclers of sadness.	2002-10-02
US	49396726	R2CSU0H72FPUH0	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	5	6	12	N	N	A heroic tragedy in an African context	Chinua Achebe's \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is the story of a man who watches helplessly as his community, quite literally, falls apart.  It takes place, presumably, in Nigeria in the nineteenth century, and the community it portrays is an Ibo clan who live in a group of nine villages collectively called Umuofia.  The protagonist is a man named Okonkwo, as noble a figure as any in literature because he is strong, brave, loyal to his family and his community, respectful of the ways of his ancestors, and strictly adheres to a personal code of honor, which in some ways is a corrective response to his own father's lazy, unprincipled lifestyle.<br />Like most in Umuofia, Okonkwo makes his living as a yam farmer, and he has built a large compound in which he lives with his three wives and numerous children, the most prominent of whom are his oldest son Nwoye and his favorite daughter Ezinma.  Since the Ibo clan is, like most societies throughout the world, a cult of masculinity, anything related to strength or honor is considered manly, and anything related to weakness or irresolution is considered womanly; so Okonkwo regrets that Ezinma, whom he loves and respects more than any of his other children, was not born male.<br />The novel is balanced between sketches of daily life in the villages and three major events that shape Okonkwo's character.  The first event is Okonkwo's adoption of a boy named Ikemefuna from a nearby village as part of a retribution for a crime committed by a resident of that village on a resident of Okonkwo's.  After living three years with Okonkwo's family, Ikemefuna becomes a good friend to Nwoye; but the village elders have decreed a sad fate for the boy, and Okonkwo has no choice but to help carry it out.  The second event is when, at a funeral for a village elder, Okonkwo's gun accidentally explodes and kills a boy; according to tribal law, Okonkwo and his family are banished from Umuofia for seven years and relocate to his mother's native village.<br/>The third event is the arrival in Nigeria of white missionaries from the Church of England.  They begin to transform Ibo society by building churches, schools, and hospitals, and establishing an Anglican government and legal system.  Part of their success is due to their ability to convince the Ibos of the sovereignty of the Christian God, and many Ibos convert.  When Okonkwo returns to Umuofia after his exile and learns that this new religion is supplanting the ancestral traditions, he is disgusted by the weak will of his clansmen and especially his own son Nwoye, who has defected to the Church and taken the name Isaac.  This event has a larger, pan-African significance, in which Okonkwo becomes a symbol of resistance to the encroachment of Europeanization.<br />\\"Things Fall Apart\\" is a short and simple novel, but it masterfully contains, within a uniquely African context, its protagonist's whole philosophy towards life and reason for being.  Whether Okonkwo's actions are to be applauded is left for the individual reader to decide, but there is no mystery about why he does them.  He is nothing if not a man of convictions, and he is willing to die for them, even by his own hand.	2002-09-30

If I had a time machine, I'd want to go back to 1840's Paris.  Not the richly cultured Paris of Chopin, Berlioz, and Delacroix, but Balzac's Paris, a circus world where envy, avarice, and revenge drive passionate people to ridiculous extremes.  One sin breeds another, and so an envious person can play off another's avarice in order to avenge a perceived slight.  I sense that Balzac was essentially a moralist who felt that sins do greater service in comedy, but the sobering effect of tragedy is important for keeping balance.<br />In \\"Cousin Bette,\\" the title character, Lisbeth \\"Bette\\" Fischer, is a plain, middle-aged spinster who has lived her whole life in the shadow of her pretty cousin Adeline.  Adeline has married the Baron Hector Hulot D'Ervy, a high-ranking military and government official who nevertheless does not have much money and is an incurable womanizer, overtly keeping mistresses in spite of his wife's inexorable devotion to him.  Their daughter, Hortense, becomes enamored with Bette's \\"boyfriend,\\" a young Polish sculptor named Wenceslas Steinbock, and marries him, believing that his (rather unremarkable) art will bring in a fortune.  At this point, Bette feels she has been upstaged one too many times by the Hulot family and resolves to take revenge.<br />One night Baron Hulot spots a beautiful young woman in Bette's apartment building and immediately plots to make her his latest mistress.  This is Bette's close friend Valerie Marneffe, whose husband happens to be menially employed in Hulot's department.  Bette gets the idea to use Valerie as a siren to entrap the men who have deceived her and enrage their wives.  In short order, Valerie seduces Hulot, his friend and romantic rival Monsieur Crevel, and Steinbock, securing for herself large sums of money and eventually marrying Crevel, who is a wealthy retired businessman.<br />I've only scratched the surface of the plot, and yet to reveal any more would be beside the point of a Balzac novel because thequality of his writing is more in the interaction between the characters than in the events that advance the story.  I've not yet even mentioned the excellent supporting cast, including Hulot's conscientious son Victorin; his wife Celestine, who happens to be Crevel's daughter; the Brazilian playboy Montejanos, whose fiery passion for Valerie endangers the lives of her and everyone around her; a sinister old woman who goes by a number of aliases and arranges \\"accidents\\"; and her accomplice, an elegant courtesan called Carabine.  All of these characters fit together perfectly like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle and elevate the novel to exciting new levels of intrigue.<br />Convention would dictate that Bette's revenge be fulfilled and Hulot learn his lesson by the end of the novel, but Balzac has a more realistic outlook than to concede to a reader's expectations.  He is a novelist with the dialogue-oriented sensibilities of a playwright and a knack for devising unusually complicated plots by making the most out of a minimal number of characters.  If, as he states in the novel, inspiration gives genius its opportunity, then \\"Cousin Bette\\" must be the product of the highest inspiration because there is plenty of genius on display.	2002-09-30

In between there's a lot of drinking, fighting, singing, grumbling, praying, implied swearing and sexual activity, bad prose, and not much else.<br />William \\"Studs\\" Lonigan is an archetypal boy growing up in a tough working-class Irish neighborhood in Chicago's south side.  The oldest of four children, Studs is a lazy student and, despite his mother's wish for him to enter the priesthood, flounders in high school and wastes his time hanging out in poolrooms and getting in scraps, ultimately going to work for his father's painting company.  Farrell successfully turns the Chicago neighborhoods into interesting fictional settings, but he never manages to elevate Studs and his boorish friends above the flatness and dullness of negative stereotypes.<br />Farrell paints a candid, savage portrait of racism and bigotry in the Irish American enclave.  There is a genuine fear of blacks moving into and taking over their neighborhoods, and a distrust of Jews as real estate agents who are orchestrating this migration and as \\"international bankers\\" who have sunk America into its Depression.  To be fair, these sentiments are not unanimous among the Irish characters in the book, but they constitute a world view expressed by Studs's financially embattled father and shared by many sympathizers.<br />The book's prose matches its protagonist: simple, gritty, and slovenly.  Farrell writes in the third person, but the voice is Studs's; the young man's thoughts concerning life, love, and sex are of the most basic.  The third novel of the trilogy, \\"Judgment Day,\\" is the best, in which the writing matures with Studs as he becomes engaged to a nice girl, worries about his weak heart and his inability to stop smoking, and struggles to find lucrative work during the draconian economic times.  Here the book also achieves a sort of dramatic crescendo, as general anxiety about the Depression, panic over closing banks and plunging stocks, and paranoia over \\"Reds\\" combine with the ominous state of Studs's health in a nightmare of Dreiseresque misery.<br />The book has some fine passages, but my overall opinion is lukewarm at best.  The simplistic prose, although maybe a stylistic necessity, is no fun when it is used at such length to document a life as uneventful as Studs's; given the clownishness of the violent scenes, at times it's like reading a comic book without the pictures.  The book doesn't seem to have any purpose other than to introduce an Irish milieu into the American literary canon -- it certainly doesn't bother to give Studs's life any purpose -- and that just isn't enough to sustain a 900-page novel.	2002-09-23

It seems a little dated in 2002, especially with regard to the enormous interim advances in computing power, but James Gleick's book still provides valuable insight into potentially one of the most effective and revolutionary mathematical tools that may solve complex problems in science and engineering that have been baffling mankind for centuries. <br />Many processes and systems in nature can be modeled mathematically with differential equations, which are useful to scientists and engineers to predict and design things to improve the standard of living.  Unfortunately, most of these systems are nonlinear, meaning that adding to an input does not produce the same addition to the output and that scaling an input does not scale the output in proportion, and the equations they yield cannot be solved in closed form without applying some judicious and optimistic simplifications.  In particular, most systems have what is called &quot;sensitive dependence to initial conditions&quot; -- small changes in the input to the system can lead to large, unpredictable, and uncontrollable changes in the output, a phenomenon summarily called the Butterfly Effect.  <br />The main point Gleick makes is that chaos is not total randomness, but rather randomness within certain generalities.  For example, summers can be expected to be generally warm and winters generally cold, but specifics like thunderstorms and blizzards can't be predicted due to turbulence and the nonlinear nature of the Navier-Stokes equation, the defining equation of fluid dynamics.  There is indeed order in chaos (as illustrated by fractals); it just needs to be identified and codified.  To that effect, the book offers many pretty, colorful pictures of various representations of chaos: the Lorenz attractor, the Mandelbrot set, the Koch snowflake (a paradoxical finite area surrounded by an infinite perimeter), the Sierpinski carpet, and the Menger sponge (a paradoxical solid of infinite surface area yet zero volume).  <br />Gleick discusses the origins of the study of chaos and its applications to different sciences -- physiology (heart rhythms, dimensions of organs), biology (animal populations), even economics.  The writing is very good, explanatory without resorting to textbook-like rigidity, and not at all math-intensive -- very few equations are presented (in fact, I would have liked to have seen more).  A reader who is familiar with differential equations (and how they describe physical systems) and calculus (and how it is used as a tool to solve linear differential equations) will have an easier time with the concepts, but rest assured this is a book for everybody.	2002-09-23
US	49396726	R122IX4NBUV8ZO	0156453800	817453848	Invisible Cities	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A feast for the senses	Eschewing all conventional literary forms, Italo Calvino's &quot;Invisible Cities&quot; is a series of short sketches of imaginary cities visited by the mercurial explorer Marco Polo, who tells his tales to Kublai Khan, the saturnine Mongol emperor who is nearing the end of his triumphant days.  But this is a work of anachronistic fantasy, and it soon becomes apparent that the cities have nothing to do with the 13th century or the Mongol empire, but exist in all times and places, or only in the mind.<br />The roughly fifty cities that Marco Polo describes are of such wild variety and curious construction, one has to wonder where Calvino gets his inspiration (aside from the obvious influence of Borges).  Marco Polo tells of Dorothea, a city that is divided like a tic-tac-toe board by four intersecting canals; Despina, a city that appears as a ship to a traveler approaching by camel, and a camel to a traveler approaching by ship; the eerily surreal Armilla, consisting of nothing but water pipes ending in plumbing fixtures; Olinda, a city which blossoms like a flower in concentric circles, evoking visions of self-generating fractals.<br />Some of the cities seem to symbolize concepts that apply to the real world.  Especially portentous is the &quot;spider-web&quot; city of Octavia, which hangs from a rope suspended between two mountain precipices; its inhabitants are less uncertain of their future than those of other cities because they at least *know* that someday the rope will break.  And Perinthia, a city that was designed under celestial guidance but whose inhabitants have turned out grotesque, offers ironic commentary on science mixing with religion.<br />Encompassing the sights, sounds, aromas, and sentiments of a world of human experience, &quot;Invisible Cities&quot; is a feast for the senses, beautifully penned by one of the truly great fabulists of the twentieth century.	2002-09-16
US	49396726	R1FEQ9DNFKVSK	0486266877	888767190	The School for Scandal (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Good satire of gabby society	Sheridan's phrase &quot;school for scandal&quot; is a grand metaphor for the gossipy London society of the late 1770's, and the longevity of the play that bears it as its title attests to its relevance in any place and time.  Sheridan captures the inherent drama and humor in the truism that people are always talking about other people behind their backs and uses it as a foundation on which to devise a plot of intrigue. <br />The school's &quot;principals&quot; are Lady Sneerwell and a man named Snake, who like to collect gossip about their neighbors and others in London society; one of their cohorts is the brilliantly ironic character Mrs. Candour, who openly reprehends idle gossip but blithely participates in it anyway.  One of their favorite subjects of gossip is the Surface brothers, Joseph and Charles.  The popular perception is that Joseph is responsible and respectable, while Charles is a wastrel and a miscreant.  <br />The Surface brothers' uncle, Sir Oliver Surface, returns to London after spending many years in India, hears the rumors about his nephews, and decides to verify them for the purpose of choosing an heir between the two.  Since he has been gone so long that his nephews would not recognize him, he visits them incognito.  Posing as a moneylender to Charles, and as a poor relative to Joseph, he discovers that his nephews are not quite of the natures he has been led to believe. <br />Sheridan employs some typical comedic devices like love triangles and hiding characters, but for the most part this is an inventive play that picks its targets well and hits the bullseye every time.  Considering it was written at such a turbulent time in England's history, it's interesting that social satire still managed to break through greater national concerns and be successful and appreciated.	2002-09-12

The novel's racy subject matter and lightning-strike narrative have the feel of pulp fiction, but the rich descriptions and illustrious prose reveal that Faulkner never strays far from the top of his form.  As expected, its base locale is Mississippi's Yoknapatawpha County, that endless wellspring of Faulkner's imagination.  <br />It's prohibition, and business is good for moonshiners like Lee Goodwin, living in a large but decrepit antebellum house with his \\"wife\\" Ruby and baby son, who is kept in a box hidden behind the stove to protect him from rats.  Goodwin, while not a bad man himself, associates with a number of hoodlums, including a sympathetic young man named Tommy and a cruel cretin called Popeye who harbors a nasty secret about his past and his libido.<br />One night, a drunk named Gowan Stevens and his girlfriend Temple Drake, the privileged daughter of a judge in Jackson and a college girl with a wild side, get into a car accident and end up spending the night at Goodwin's house, where Gowan had been planning to buy some whiskey.  Temple, warned by Ruby that the house is no place for a girl like her, and abandoned by Gowan the next day, finds herself in a nightmarish predicament when Popeye brutally robs her of whatever innocence she had, drives her to Memphis, and puts her up at a cathouse fronting as a respectable hotel, run by a careworn but charitable madam named Miss Reba.<br />But Popeye and Temple have to answer for the murder of Tommy, who was shot around the time they left.  Goodwin gets arrested, and a friendly lawyer named Horace Benbow, himself on vacation from his nagging wife, decides to defend him at the trial.  This leads to some detective work to find Temple, who is being held prisoner by Popeye in that Memphis hotel and would provide valuable witness testimony.  The manner in which Benbow manages to do this proves Faulkner's skill in characterization, as he employs two members of the infamous Snopes family to comic as well as narrative effect.<br />\\"Sanctuary\\" has two very memorable morbid, but poetic, images: the first involving Flaubert's doomed Madame Bovary, of all people; and the second describing a funeral for a small-time hoodlum that is transformed into a bacchanalian celebration by the fatalistic sensibilities of the Memphis underworld.  This is a scene which could be conjured only by a William Faulkner (or a Nathanael West).<br />This novel is an odd brew.  It feels messy yet still exhibits an unquestionable professionalism; its characters are grotesque but all the more interesting because of it.  Faulkner's writing is never explicit; you must be attentive to clues and details because you'll be expected to piece together the puzzle later.  This is the main challenge confronting his readers, but understanding Faulkner means being willing to accept this challenge.	2002-09-10
US	49396726	R3JMZUG9ARO595	0140444173	748295604	War and Peace (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	"The force that moves nations"	To put it in the simplest terms, \\"War and Peace\\" chronicles the lives of three Russian families during the Napoleonic wars of 1805 to 1820.  While this premise by itself doesn't seem sufficient to justify a 1,500-page novel, Tolstoy manages to assemble a successful set of ingredients: the very character of Napoleon, inarguably one of the most charismatic and intriguing military leaders in history; his campaigns which changed Europe irrevocably; meticulously detailed battle strategies; and the human drama of war, domesticity, and romance.<br />When the novel begins, Napoleon's visions of a united Europe are gradually becoming a reality.  Russia is the final frontier, so to speak, and while the Russians don't want to be annexed by France, they actually consider French a fashionable culture and speak the language frequently on social and formal occasions.  The novel covers the two major military campaigns that concern Russia: the battle at Austerlitz in 1805, in which Napoleon's army crushes the Russians and Austrians, and Napoleon's invasion of Moscow in 1812 after the pyrrhic battle at Borodino.  The last third of the novel is devoted to masterful descriptions of the panic and chaos that erupt in the streets of Moscow as many citizens flee for their lives, leaving the city ablaze; followed by the French retreat, accelerated by the pursuit of roving bands of Russian guerrillas.  Basically, the novel covers the time from the peak of Napoleon's powers to the retreat that signified the beginning of his downfall.<br />Besides the principals Napoleon and Tsar Alexander of Russia, there are dozens, maybe hundreds, of named characters in the novel, too many for a succinct plot summary.  These are primarily members of the three middle to upper class families -- the Rostovs, the Kuragins, and the Bolkonskys -- and their friends and relatives and various soldiers.  Tolstoy's purpose is to show their interrelations and how wartime affects and interferes with their lives.  The character who receives the most focus is Pierre Bezuhov, the illegitimate son of a count who inherits his father's fortune and marries a beautiful and wealthy Kuragin daughter.  His life odyssey -- from a somewhat carefree and irresolute young man to a Freemason convert to a philanthropic landholder to a soldier to a prisoner of war -- seems to represent Tolstoy's idea of the redemption of man through the suffering of the realities of the world.<br />In the novel, Tolstoy does not withhold his personal opinions on Napoleon and Kutuzov, the commander-in-chief of the Russian army.  He regards Napoleon as an arrogant, dishonorable, and unwarrantedly admired scoundrel, and Kutuzov as an underappreciated hero and symbol of Russian fortitude.  He even gives the novel a philosophical spin, musing on the failure of diplomacy and the complexity of the causes of war.  However, the narrative is mostly objective, portraying these men as they actually might have acted, and effectively separates story from propaganda.<br />Despite its daunting length and occasional dips into sentimentality, \\"War and Peace\\" is probably the single most important war novel of Western literature; so expansive as to contain a world of concepts, from political showboating to hypocrisy and all the absurdities that the theater of war entails; so comprehensive and definitive, it seems inconceivable for it not to have influenced every war novel that came after it, either directly or indirectly.haracter who receives the most focus is Pierre Bezuhov, the illegitimate son of a count who inherits his father's fortune and marries a beautiful and wealthy Kuragin daughter.

US	49396726	REXBPELAAU2B4	0394561619	702863006	Love in the Time of Cholera	Books	5	6	8	N	N	More love than cholera	How long can a man hold out for a woman?  The duration of the love triangle in \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" is well over half a century, and for the novel's protagonist as well as for its readers, patience is most richly rewarded.  There is little of the magic realism that was the chief characteristic of Garcia Marquez's masterpiece \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" but the novel is no less magical because it astutely demonstrates that love is the most natural of magics, able to compel men and women to do fantastic and desperate things.  <br />Garcia Marquez tends not to be specific about naming his settings, but we can surmise that the novel takes place in a Colombian city on the Carribean coast over a span of at least sixty years that bridge the 19th and 20th centuries, a time when continual civil wars between Liberal and Conservative factions and cholera epidemics have been ravaging the country.  <br />It is at the beginning of this epoch that Florentino Ariza, a timid, thin, poor young man with such a ravenous appetite for beauty that he eats flowers, falls in love with a beautiful girl named Fermina Daza while delivering a telegraph to her father.  She reciprocates Florentino's interest through written correspondence conveyed by her nunnish aunt, but her father, thinking Florentino isn't good enough for her, takes her away on an extended vacation.  When she returns and confronts Florentino, she realizes that her love for him has been extinguished.<br />Meanwhile, a handsome young doctor named Juvenal Urbino, having returned from studying medicine in Paris, becomes infatuated with Fermina.  Her initial coldness eventually succumbs to his charm and manners, and they get married, spend a very long honeymoon in Europe, and for the next 51 years live a (mostly) happy life together as one of the city's wealthiest and most respected couples, with refined tastes in everything.<br />All this is naturally heartbreaking to Florentino, who resigns himself to bachelorhood and spending the next 51 years working his way up the ladder at his uncle's mercantile ship company and coveting Dr. Urbino's wife.  He had been preserving his virginity for her, but after being raped by an unseen woman, he realizes that he can replace his love for Fermina with an \\"earthly passion\\" and proceeds to have liaisons with literally hundreds of women of all colors, shapes, sizes, and ages.<br />It seems inevitable that Florentino and Fermina will reunite after Dr. Urbino's death (a fatal accident while trying to catch his pet parrot), and I found satisfaction in the closure.  As such, the novel feels like a fable or even an adult fairy tale, for that is Garcia Marquez's special trademark: the mature nonchalance with which he introduces elements from the humorously ironic to the darkly necromantic (consider the episodes of the black doll and the woman in white on the riverside).  Love, marriage, and adultery are mundane things which in the hands of a lesser author become cliches, but achieve magical qualities in Garcia Marquez's unique world.	2002-08-26
US	49396726	R17ZW5IJXV7YGN	0156711427	842807821	A Passage to India	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Great memorial to British India	With all due respect to Rudyard Kipling, E.M. Forster's \\"A Passage to India\\" seems likely to remain the definitive novel about British Imperialist India written by an Englishman.  It does not merely see India as a picturesque land in which to set an exotic adventure, but examines the complicated relationships between the British and the Indians with penetrating wisdom, astuteness, and fairness.  Forster is not shy about portraying the British attitude towards the Indians as one of bigotry and condescension, but he also notes the considerable cultural and religious conflicts between the Muslims and the Hindus.   <br />Most of the action takes place in a city called Chandrapore and concerns the friendship between a British school principal named Cyril Fielding and a Muslim physician named Dr. Aziz.  The novel's events are set in motion in an empty mosque, where a praying Aziz meets an elderly Englishwoman named Mrs. Moore.  After some friendly conversation, they take a liking to each other, and Aziz learns that Mrs. Moore's son is a man he knows well -- Ronny Heaslop, the Magistrate of Chandrapore.  Later, having tea at Fielding's house, Aziz meets Mrs. Moore again and her companion, a young lady named Adela Quested, who is vaguely affianced to Ronny.  Eager to see the \\"real\\" India, Adela enthusiastically accepts Aziz's offer to go on a picnic to the Marabar caves, a nearby tourist attraction, and Mrs. Moore is convinced to accompany them.<br />Forster lavishly describes the journey to the caves -- by train and then elephant -- and the caves themselves, each of which apparently is shaped somewhat like a frying pan, with a short corridor ending in a circular chamber.  The outing proves to be much more eventful than the three spelunkers expected.  Mrs. Moore, haunted by the eerie echos the caves propagate, crosses the threshold of insanity.  And upon their return to Chandrapore, Adela claims that she was sexually assaulted in one of the caves and accuses Aziz, who is consequently arrested and tried for the crime.  <br />Of course, there are a few different explanations for what really happened to Adela in the caves, but the British are prejudicially biased against Aziz.  This puts Fielding in a quandary, as his defense of his good friend Aziz infuriates his British compatriots and gets him kicked out of his club.  When Adela later admits that she can't confirm Aziz's guilt, Ronny acknowledges that a retraction of the charges would embarrass the British; he even hustles his mother out of India because, as a witness, her increasing incoherence would damage the case for the prosecution.   <br />Although the cave incident and the subsequent trial drive the plot, the novel is more about the clash of three headstrong societies (Muslim, Hindu, and Christian) forced to dwell together amidst political turmoil, and how certain members of these societies manage to reconcile themselves to each other's differences.  The final scene between Fielding and Aziz, in which Aziz uncannily predicts an independent Indian nation resulting from British dissolution, is a poignant display of this theme; for all the trouble and conflict in the world, there is always room for friendship and understanding.	2002-08-21

If tragedy is, as Aristotle described, the imitation (that is, representation) of great people whose downfall induces a sense of pity and fear in the audience, Sophocles's plays are exemplary illustrations of the genre.  The Sophoclean hero suffers, agonizes, despairs because of cruel fate or, more likely, some mistake he or she has made as a result of a character flaw such as pride or anger.  Thus the tragedy of \\"Ajax\\" is not only that the title character kills himself in shame over having lost out to Odysseus on being awarded Achilles's armor, the ownership of which would have been proof of his heroic deeds in battle, but that his shame might have been alleviated had he known that Odysseus greatly respected his heroism.  Similarly, in \\"Antigone,\\" Creon, king of Thebes, suffers the loss of his wife and son over his stubborn insistence to enforce a law founded on his pride.<br />Sophocles portrays \\"noble\\" sufferers too.  In \\"Electra,\\" the title heroine plots to kill her mother Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus, but she has a good reason -- revenge for killing her father Agamemnon and bounding her to a life of slavish submission.  The title hero of \\"Philoctetes\\" is marooned on an island through no fault of his own, and furthermore becomes the target of trickery when Odysseus and Neoptolemus, Achilles's son, show up with the intent to obtain a magic bow in his possession which they need to win the Trojan War.  Heracles's wife Deianeira, in \\"The Women in Trachis,\\" catches her husband in the act of intended infidelity; her reaction is to send him a cloak she thinks is a talisman to keep him faithful to her, when in reality it is poisoned.  That Electra's plans are fulfilled, Philoctetes receives sympathy, and Deianeira kills herself in grief shows the range of emotions that lead to the end of a Sophoclean tragedy.<br />The most masterful of these plays is \\"Oedipus the King,\\" which seeks to maximize pity and fear in the audience by portraying some of the most tragic circumstances imaginable -- a hero who unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother as was prophesied, and then, to his horror, discovers their identities.  Does Oedipus, like Deianeira, kill himself in grief?  No, that would be too merciful.  Instead, he gouges out his eyes in self-punishment and lives to continue suffering, as an abject vagrant in \\"Oedipus at Colonus.\\"<br />In this Signet Classics edition, Paul Roche translates these plays in verse rather than prose, which preserves their poeticality, improves their clarity, and significantly increases the enjoyability of reading them.  This is the perfect edition for getting acquainted with one of the great Greek dramatists.	2002-08-19

The message Austen is conveying is that the rules of the marriage game are, at least to the propriety-conscious gentry, more interesting than the romance that leads to marriage.<br />The novel's heroine is Elizabeth Bennet, the second, and the wittiest and liveliest, of five daughters in a middle class English family.  Her mother, a simple and silly creature whose greatest desire in life is that her dowry-deficient daughters should marry well, is ecstatic when she learns that a wealthy single young man named Mr. Bingley has moved into a nearby house; she imagines him a potential husband for one of her daughters.  Bingley turns out to be charming and friendly, but his friend, Mr. Darcy, also wealthy, single, and young, snobbishly appears to consider himself superior to the Bennets.<br />Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Bingley, but Darcy tries to discourage his friend from courting a girl of a social status lower than his.  Elizabeth and Darcy develop a strangely flirtatious relationship that is partly affectionate and partly adversarial, provoking the jealousy of Bingley's attention-starved sister, who is attracted to Darcy.  Elizabeth must also fend off the affections of her cousin, a clergyman named Mr. Collins who is amusingly persistent in his marriage proposals to her; fortunately, her rebuffs finally cause him to marry her less attractive friend instead.  Collins shamelessly panders to his patroness, the haughty, imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who practically demands that Darcy (who happens to be her nephew) marry her diminutive daughter, and Elizabeth had better not get in the way.<br />A charming young soldier named Mr. Wickham, whose father was employed by Darcy's father and who became Darcy's father's ward after his own father's death, enters the story.  To Elizabeth he claims that Darcy is withholding money from him that is due him; Darcy responds that Wickham is a freeloader who is not entitled to any more money than he has already gotten.  Wickham risks damaging the Bennets' reputation when Elizabeth's youngest sister Lydia, who is as prattling and frivolous as her mother, impetuously decides to elope with him.<br />If the \\"pride\\" in the novel is Darcy's self-regard, the \\"prejudice\\" is Elizabeth's initial opinion of him as an insufferable snob, because by the end she learns that he is quite honorable and charitable after all.  He reveals to Elizabeth that he was raised by his parents to feel superior to the lower classes, but her willingness to stand up to him and his conceit has taught him modesty and humility and endeared her to him.  It is this transformation of character, similar to a gender role reversal of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" that distinguishes Austen's novel as a special achievement of 19th Century English literature.	2002-08-13

Like the infamous Shady Hill of his short stories, Bullet Park is a whitebread outpost for white-collar professionals who commute daily to the city and drink heavily on weekends, and often weekdays.  In a comfortable house on a comfortable street in this town lives Eliot Nailles, a chemist whose specialty is mouthwash and who plies his craft with the conviction that bad breath can lead to global destruction, a respectable family man devoted to his wife Nellie and his teenage son Tony, and an avid churchgoer, although more out of a sense of duty than piety.<BR> <BR>Tony's privileged status as an only child and a middle class Baby Boomer has bred an adolescence painful both to himself and to his parents, and he still continues to teeter on the brink of knuckleheadedness.  With the insight of a child psychologist and the wisdom of an embattled father, Cheever recounts Tony's various phases: his addiction to television, his threat against his French teacher, his strange sudden interest in poetry, the brash older woman he invites to his parents' house for lunch, and especially his mysterious depression which confines him to bed for weeks and requires the healing power of a \\"swami\\" whose idea of therapy is to repeat mantras. <BR> <BR>One day a man named Paul Hammer and his wife Marietta move into Bullet Park and befriend the Nailleses.  Through first person narration, Paul reveals his colorful past:  The illegitimate child of a wealthy, sculpturally ideal father and an eccentric, bookish mother, he uses his Yale education to drift drunkenly through life, translate the work of an Italian poet, and search for the perfect home -- one with a room with yellow walls.  His mother's hatred of American capitalism inspires him to murder a well-to-do suburbanite as some kind of statement against bourgeois complacency -- and the man he chooseshappens to be Tony Nailles.<br />The climax is quite surprising and arrives at a moment of the highest suspense and tension, an unusual technique for Cheever, who tends to use dialogue, thoughts, and impressions rather than action to resolve his characters' conflicts.  But Cheever's fiction is always full of surprises, even though his subject matter seldom changes; his talent lies in his ability to imagine fascinating stories lurking behind the bland facades of American suburbia and crystallize them with his reliably brilliant prose.  \\"Bullet Park\\" is a satire and a comedy; it patiently observes suburban provinciality and materialism, and even raises a question about oyster etiquette, all while holding up a distorted mirror to an anticipated readership that lives in places very much like the one it describes.	2002-08-12

But whereas Crusoe's goal was to return to a state of civilization he found familiar and comfortable, Buck, the hero of Jack London's novella, simply drifts further and further into the primitivism that is his natural canine calling.<br />The story takes place during the Alaska-Yukon gold rush of the end of the nineteenth century, where large, strong dogs are in demand to run the sleds between Skagway on the Pacific coast and Dawson inland, a trip hundreds of miles long through bitterly cold weather and treacherous terrain.  Buck, the 140-pound offspring of a St. Bernard and a Scotch sheep dog, is living in a nice home in the sunny Santa Clara valley of California when he is kidnapped by a gardener with gambling debts and sold up the Pacific until he is bought by two French Canadian couriers who immediately indoctrinate him into being part of a sled dog team.<br />This is a rude awakening for Buck, who must learn the strenuous routines of hauling the sled and running with the pack, all the while adjusting to the new climate and feeding patterns.  Soon a rivalry develops between him and the lead dog, Spitz, but as he gains strength and ferocity, he manages to fight and defeat Spitz and take his position as the lead dog.  London keeps Buck and the other dogs \\"in character\\" with this one important exception: he allows them to have human feelings of pride and achievement.<br />Buck passes from master to master as the route is traversed back and forth and different sleds come and go; but finally he finds his best master in a man named John Thornton, who nurses him back to health after a particularly cruel and inept driver nearly kills him with over-exertion.  Buck becomes Thornton's most prized possession and accompanies his party to a remote mine to search for gold, where he helps the men with hauling and hunting.

Wodehouse book.  But set this story in early 19th Century northern Italy, build it on an opulent foundation of picaresque romance and political intrigue, add equal measures of comedy and tragedy, and you have Stendhal's exuberant, wonderful novel.<br />Stendhal portrays the towns and states of northern Italy, all of which are ruled (during the Napoleonic era) by princes and dukes of varying degrees of care and competence, as vibrant playgrounds of Shakespearean passions for the rich.  It is among this aristocracy that the hero, Fabrice del Dongo, is born and raised.  Selecting Napoleon as his own hero, he runs away to France to join his cavalry just in time for the Battle of Waterloo; however, his adventures end in disillusion and humiliation (things didn't go so well for Napoleon, either), and he returns to Milan where his malicious brother has gotten him into trouble with the law.<br />Thus Fabrice seems destined to live his life on the run.  His good looks and devilish persona make him irresistible to girls and loathsome to their jealous boyfriends, one of whom, named Giletti, Fabrice is compelled to kill in self-defense.  For this act, he is imprisoned in a high tower in Parma, where the Governor's daughter, Clelia Conti, who lives in a palazzo adjoining the tower, attracts his romantic interest and tries to protect him from being poisoned by his enemies.<br />Fabrice's aunt, Gina del Dongo, is as central a character to the novel as her nephew.  She uses her legendary beauty and charm to influence men to do her favors, such as helping Fabrice break out of prison.  Her partner in crime is the equally ambitious Count Mosca, who schemes his way to becoming Prime Minister and loves Gina madly.  Helping her help Fabrice out of his predicaments poses a dilemma for him, however; he actually considers the young man his romantic rival.  And in some perverse way, he's right.  <BR>  <BR>Despite the ribald nature of the events, this is a sad novel; it is about people who mistake passion for the end rather than the means and let it destroy their lives.  And yet the novel is often very funny, particularly in Stendhal's satirical comparisons between the French and the Italian mentalities.  He is aware that the French reader will find the plot absurd and the characters hopelessly immoral, but the point he is making is that even though this type of behavior -- adultery, bribery, simony, murderous revenge -- exists in every country, the Italians do it with a particular flair that makes it a unique cultural phenomenon.	2002-08-06
US	49396726	RWQFY4B4C02K4	0449213447	370928266	The Chosen	Books	3	5	9	N	N	The sociology of Orthodox Judaism	\\"The Chosen\\" is a story about Orthodox Jews written for a secular audience, and while there's nothing wrong with this idea, it often feels like a TV-movie-of-the-week's worth of familiar themes of friendship and father-son relationships topped with gratuitous sprinklings of Judaica, packaged as a novel. It takes place in Brooklyn in the 1940's and is narrated by a teenage boy named Reuven Malter, whose father is a teacher at a local yeshiva. Reuven's neighborhood is a primarily Orthodox Jewish enclave with many sects of Hasidic Jews who scorn the \\"regular\\" Orthodox as \\"apikorsim,\\" or assimilated Jews of lesser devotion to Torah and God. <br />One day Reuven meets a Hasidic boy his age named Danny Saunders at a softball game; in fact, Danny's line drive puts the bespectacled Reuven in the hospital to get glass shards removed from his eye. Danny's contrition leads him to visit Reuven in the hospital, where they overcome their differences as Jews to become friends. Reuven starts hanging out at Danny's house, where Danny's father, a tzaddik (community rabbi and Talmudic authority), conducts services to his Hasidic sect and discusses the Talmud with his son in an intense, magisterial manner. <br />Despite their scholarly respect for each other, Danny's relationship with his father is quite distant. Danny is a brilliant student who is able to memorize large portions of the Talmud, but he is also a voracious reader of secular books, and his father believes that any activity that takes time away from studying Talmud is iniquitous. He confides wistfully to Reuven that he is interested in psychology and does not care to inherit his father's position as the community tzaddik, even though it is expected of him. That Danny is constantly expanding his world outside the Talmud, the only thing his father can talk to him about, is driving a wedge between father and son. <br />I felt that the plot developments were rather predictable. The boys' friendship is tested by their fathers'conflicting views on Zionism -- Reuven's believes a new Jewish state will ennoble the deaths of six million Jews in the concentration camps; Danny's believes a secular Jewish state created and governed by apikorsim would be an affront to God -- of course, the importance of Jewish unity in the face of Arab hostility against the newly formed state of Israel is cause for reconciliation. And will Danny's father graciously come to accept his son's desire to pursue an outside profession? Don't hold your breath. <br />Structurally, thematically, and linguistically, this novel is about as simple and straightforward as they come; like an essay on the sociology of Orthodox Judaism, it often reads like a textbook. I can't deny the novel's warmth and sincerity, but I can't ignore the trite formulas, the Hallmark sentiments, the flatness of its characterization, the dry, bland prose, or the overly egoistic first person narration. I enjoyed the story-within-a-story about the founding of Hasidism and the recounting of the first bloody days of Israel's existence, which demonstrate that Potok's writing can be engaging and informative, but is third-rate fiction like \\"The Chosen\\" the right vehicle for it?	2002-08-01

In a way, it contains the prototypical visions of the afterlife, images of heavenly and hellish realms that would remain definitive and powerful to centuries of readers.  Structurally, it is a poem divided into three parts: Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Heaven).  The protagonist, Dante himself, must travel through these three realms in order to reach God, the ultimate beatitude.<br />The poem begins with Dante lost in the woods, like a man who lacks spiritual guidance or is uncertain how to live his life.  He is approached by the Roman poet Virgil, who offers to lead him out of the wilderness.  They have to travel down through the depths of Hell and face Satan himself (Inferno) before they can escape to the outside world and scale the mountain of Purgatory (Purgatorio), at the top of which is situated the Garden of Eden, where Beatrice, Dante's earthly love, will guide him up through the celestial spheres towards Heaven (Paradiso).<br />Dante's great inspiration is his concept of the physical and spiritual aspects of these realms.  Hell is composed of nine circles arranged in an inverted cone, each circle representing a mortal sin such as violence, theft, treason, witchcraft, blasphemy, suicide, heresy, etc., in which souls who committed these sins in their lifetimes are punished.  Even the topmost circle is a sort of Limbo reserved for pre-Christians like Virgil himself, pagans and the unbaptized.  Having envisioned this infernal masterpiece, Dante could be considered Hell's greatest architect.<br />The mountain of Purgatory consists of seven terraces, each representing some corrigible sin like envy, pride, anger, etc., on which souls who committed these sins in their lifetimes do penance.  The Garden of Eden represents living man's ideal state of existence, that of perfect wisdom and nearness to God.  Admission to the Garden of Eden must be earned by doing penance for earthly sins, hence Purgatory.  In the Paradiso, the celestial spheres, each representing a virtue (ambition, love, prudence, fortitude, etc.), consist of the moon, the inner and outer planets, the sun (based on the Ptolemaic model of the solar system), and finally Heaven, wherein dwell God and all angels.<br />The poem could be considered a morality tale or a series of object lessons, but it's a little more purely narrative than that, given its creative illustration of the hierarchy of souls and its effortless synergy of classical Greco-Roman mythology and Christian theology.  It is an essential Medieval literary landmark, and it is difficult to imagine how European literature would have evolved without it.do penance.

This Bantam Classics edition presents, through translations by different sources, eight of Plato's \\"early\\" dialogues, all involving Socrates, his apotheosized master.  Written in the form of question-and-answer sessions, these dialogues profile a man in a continuous quest for the truth, even when he is awaiting his execution, and demonstrate a particular system of gathering information and building knowledge, a system that is nothing less than the foundation of Western thought.<br />The oracle at Delphi stated that Socrates was the wisest of men because he knew that his wisdom was paltry -- unlike the Sophists, who not only thought they could teach things like virtue and \\"excellence\\" to the youth of Athens but also charged money for their tutelage.  Since Socrates admits to knowing nothing, he gains all his knowledge through inquiry, deferring to his interlocutors' presumed knowledge, often using sarcasm with the Sophists.  His questions commonly use logic of the form \\"If A is the same as B and B is the opposite of C, isn't A the opposite of C?\\"<br />Socrates saw himself as a \\"gadfly\\" to Athenian society, always seeking truth -- an absolute truth, as opposed to the moral relativism taught by the Sophists and practiced by the Athenians.  His basic interest was inquiring of the way a man should live his life, one conclusion being that to suffer is better than to cause suffering, since the immortal soul is judged constantly by the gods.<br />Some of the arguments might seem specious to the modern reader, but the importance of reading the dialogues is not necessarily to agree with any particular argument presented but to observe an intensely systematic and organized method of gaining knowledge through interrogatory dialogue.  First-hand experience tells me that asking and answering questions is a better way to learn than listening to a one-sided lecture, and reading Plato's Socratic recollections confirms my opinion.	2002-07-24

Even with its antiquated setting, \\"Omensetter's Luck\\" is so avant-garde and eccentric that it's a challenge to write a review that doesn't seem like a shameful oversimplification.  Imagine a story about perceptions of good and evil, envy, and suspicion narrated in an impressionistic, stream-of-consciousness style that rivals Faulkner at his most experimental, combining uniquely poetic prose, Joycean wordplay, an ominous mood, and multiple focuses, voices, and perspectives, and you'll begin to get the idea.  <br />The time is evidently the late nineteenth century, the place a small town called Gilean located on the Ohio River.  A \\"wide and happy\\" man named Brackett Omensetter recently has moved into town with his pregnant wife, two daughters, dog, and a mountain of furniture and belongings on a horse-drawn cart.  He rents a house from a man named Henry Pimber and gets a job as a tanner with Mat Watson, the town blacksmith.<br />Omensetter quickly becomes an object of curiosity in Gilean for his unbelievable, almost supernatural, luck.  In the middle of the rainy season, the rain stops for his moving day; his house manages to avoid an otherwise damage-guaranteeing flood; he seems impervious to injury.  He's an expert stone skipper and an effective naturalistic healer.  Nobody will bet against him.  He is not only aware of his own incredible luck; he depends on it so strongly that it replaces religion, and he feels no need to attend Gilean's only church, ministered by the Reverend Jethro Furber.  <br />Furber is a fascinating character who avoids the flatness of most fictional preachers.  His parents sheltered him insufferably as a child, depriving him of anything they considered a bad moral influence and prohibiting him from playing with other kids; now he walks around reciting dirty songs to himself and talks to the grave of Pike, a previous pastor.  He resents Omensetter's neglect of the church yet is intrigued by his ostensible luck; unsurprisingly, he accuses Omensetter of being \\"of the dark ways\\" and \\"beyond the reach of God.\\"  He tries gently to persuade Watson to fire Omensetter, which would force him to leave town...P>Approaching \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and \\"As I Lay Dying\\" in complexity of both narration and characterization, \\"Omensetter's Luck\\" is an odd book in both style and substance, the product of an independent literary thinker who demonstrates that a truly good story transcends even the strangest packaging.	2002-07-22

Moses Herzog has the background for it: a middle-aged professor whose field of study is the theory of history sprinkled with bits of philosophy.  He is a profound thinker but an ineffectual doer, and part of his discontent is that he knows this, but could not live any other way. <br />Like his author, Herzog was born in Canada and moved to Chicago as a young boy, his Jewish upbringing defining his earliest world views.  Although their father was a bootlegger, the Herzog brothers became honest and successful businessmen, except for Moses, who struggles to remain gainfully employed living in New York, teaching occasional adult workshops, and trying to write an academic book on Romanticism, his specialty.<br />Both of Herzog's marriages have ended in divorce.  His latter wife, Madeleine, had been having an affair with his crippled (and married) best friend, Valentine Gersbach.  She is presently living in Chicago with him and her and Herzog's daughter, June, who Herzog fears is being abused.  Herzog's awkwardness with the modern, active world is demonstrated when his trip to Chicago in a furtive attempt to see his daughter ends in a dangerous situation and an embarrassing confrontation with Madeleine. <br />Since Herzog is a man of words and not action, he expresses his feelings and beliefs by writing impromptu letters which he never sends.  This is just as well, since his addressees would be indifferent, hostile, unavailable, or are dead.  Various relatives, girlfriends, colleagues, civic authorities, and icons like Eisenhower, Martin Luther King, and Nietzsche are the unknowing recipients of his observations, perceptions, complaints, and rhetorical questions.  These letters are not just missives of passive aggression; they are the silent manifestos of a man who has no appropriate public forum for expressing his opinions. <br />The novel is spiced (or spiked) with many of Herzog's acquaintances, including his new girlfriend, a sexy, sultry Argentine florist named Ramona; Sono, the Japanese student he had an affair with; his pathetic, melodramatic lawyer friend Sandor Himmelstein, whose disrespectful daughters are \\"killing\\" him; Lucas Asphalter, a zoologist who tried to resuscitate a dead monkey; and his psychiatrist Dr. Edvig.  More than just interesting supporting characters, these people are contributors to Herzog's state of mind.<br />Moses Herzog seems to typify Bellow's brand of American Jewish intellectual, a person with a keen eye for human suffering (witness his casual interest in the sad courtroom cases he spectates) and an instinct for survival in spite of all his faults.  His relationship with Ramona assures him that life goes on, even through all the chaos and disillusion of being a learned person trapped in the wasteland of American culture.  He will go on writing his letters, and the country will continue to embrace those who reject intellect and express \\"potato love.\\"	2002-07-16

This is one of the finest examples of a character-driven novel, where the plot is customized to the characters, rather than the other way around.<br />A major theme in this novel is marrying wrong.  Dorothea Brooke, a girl with ideas of social reform -- one of her occupations is designing cottages for poor villagers -- marries the scholarly but stodgy Edward Casaubon, who is old enough to be her father, because she is attracted to his disciplined, erudite mind.  However, Casaubon employs her as a sort of secretary and assistant and becomes increasingly demanding of her.  Then there is the seemingly fairy-tale marriage of Tertius Lydgate, a brilliant and promising young physician, to Rosamond Vincy, spoiled daughter of the mayor of Middlemarch, a wealthy manufacturer.  Rosamond's expensive tastes endanger their marriage financially and romantically.  On the other hand, the marriage of Dorothea's younger sister Celia to the dapper Sir James Chettam is nothing but bubble-headed bliss because they both are too superficial to care for anything deeper than peerage and pulchritude.<br />The novel ties its characters together with a few interrelated plot threads, the most important of which concerns Casaubon's young second cousin, Will Ladislaw.  Will and Casaubon have little respect for each other, and when Casaubon suspects that Will and Dorothea are attracted to each other, he places a stipulation in his will denying Dorothea his fortune upon his death if she marries Will.  Moreover, Will has been cheated out of his own fortune by Middlemarch banker Nicholas Bulstrode, who finances the hospital that employs Lydgate.  Lydgate'sassociation with the dishonest Bulstrode threatens to cause him further disgrace and ostracize him from the town.<br />Meanwhile, Rosamond's brother Fred typifies the irresponsible young man with money problems who manages to reform himself and win the respect of the girl he loves.  The irony is that Fred expected a great inheritance from a rich uncle who instead, on his deathbed, offered the money to his servant Mary Garth, who happens to be Fred's beloved.  Now, Fred's only options are to join the clergy, which Mary would not approve of, or get a job -- with Mary's father.     <br />More serious and intellectual than the works of her immediate forebear Dickens, Eliot's novel seems to strike out bold new territory for British fiction of the time, especially considering the progressive mindsets of characters like Dorothea and Lydgate who act in contrast to tradition-bound grunts like Casaubon and the other town doctors.  Her sophisticated prose style of intricately structured sentences and deep psychological penetration appears to have been a huge influence on Henry James.  Much more than the sum of its parts, though, \\"Middlemarch\\" leaves its reader with a distinct impression of a time and place and, on reflection, the rewarding feeling of having accepted the challenge of reading it.	2002-07-15

It concerns a dispute between the Pacific & Southwestern Railroad (in historical reality, the Southern Pacific) which owns the land it runs through and the tenant wheat ranchers who farm it.  For one thing, the ranchers would like to own the land by buying it off the railroad, but the railroad raises the price per acre to exorbitant levels in violation of a previous contract; also, the ranchers are protesting the railroad's monopolistic policy of charging high freight rates for shipping wheat, which cuts into their profits.<br />The characterization of the novel is rather straightforward.  The \\"heroes\\" are the ranchers, which include \\"Governor\\" Magnus Derrick, an ostensibly upstanding politician; Broderson, an ineffectual old man; Osterman, a loudmouthed joker; Annixter, an irascible and obstinate misogynist; and an engineer named Dyke who starts his own hops business after being laid off by the railroad.  The author himself is presumably represented by a third-party observer named Presley, a poet who lives on the Derrick ranch and is using the scenery and the conflict as inspiration.  The \\"villain\\" is, of course, the railroad, which is personified by a porcine banker named S. Behrman who acts as the railroad's agent and mouthpiece and whose frequent insensitivity and cruelty reduces him to a simplistic caricature.<br />The ranchers decide that the best way to keep the railroad's freight rates under control is to elect their own officials to the state Railroad Commission, which would entail bribery; after all, the railroad practically owns the Commission as it is.  Despite their getting the Governor's son, Lyman Derrick, to represent them on the Commission, the ranchers' scheme proves ineffective.  The railroad ultimately offers the wheat land for sale at the raised prices and sends \\"dummy\\" buyers out to dispossess the ranchers, who arm themselves to defend their homes.  The result is a shockingly violent confrontation that shakes Presley's sentiments to the core.<br />\\"The Octopus\\" has some elements that I found distracting, puzzling, or faulty.  First, there is not just one but *two* romantic subplots: Annixter's difficult courtship with a girl whose family works on his ranch (but at least we see how his marriage transforms his character positively and plausibly); and the shepherd/spiritualist Vanamee's incomprehensible nightly summonings of the ghost of his long-lost love Angele.  Some of the dialogue is rendered flaccid by the use of euphemisms -- it's unbelievable that Annixter would refrain from calling Behrman anything worse than a \\"pip.\\"  The unctuous tone it applies to its oppressed-worker-vs.-corporate-monster theme is similar to the approach Steinbeck would use almost forty years later in \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"<br />Despite its obvious flaws, however, \\"The Octopus\\" manages to be an exemplary work of American literature.  The subject matter is unique and necessary for its time, and the commercial and legal aspects of the conflict are treated with maturity and confidence.  It uses the perpetual production of wheat as a metaphor for the continuous cycle of the good of the earth prevailing over the evil of men.  But most importantly, it achieves the highest purpose of a novel about business:  It examines the integrity and resolve of men faced with financial ruin.ut to dispossess the ranchers, who arm themselves to defend their homes.

The plot of \\"A Handful of Dust\\" goes in strange, unlikely directions for a comic novel -- the sad fate of its protagonist near the end fits the Aristotelian definition of tragedy -- but in Waugh's world, every misfortune is merely a setup for a new quirky development.<br />It is the story of the dissolution of the marriage of Lord Tony and Lady Brenda Last, but that's just what happens in the background.  The Lasts' house, an old country manor called Hetton with rooms named after characters from Arthurian legend, is Tony's pride and joy, even more so than their little son John Andrew.  One weekend they receive as an unwelcome guest an acquaintance of Tony's, an idle, insipid young Londoner named John Beaver who lives with his mother due to limited finances.  Beaver has a rotten time, but he attracts the interest of Brenda, who decides to take a flat in London to have an affair with him and tells Tony she's there taking a course in \\"economics.\\"<br />To assuage her guilt, Brenda tries to set Tony up in an affair of his own by sending him one of her friends as a potential paramour, an ostentatious Moroccan princess who can't even get his name right.  Tony is as oblivious to this come-on as he is to his wife's affair, and of course he's the last to find out, but not until after their son's accidental death, which seems to be the wedge that drives them finally apart.    <br />Divorce is inevitable, and Tony, under emotional stress and wanting to get away for a while, decides to take a trip to a new, exotic place.  A chance meeting with a curious archeologist named Dr. Messinger, who is searching for a fabulous lost city in South America, convinces him to join the doctor in his rather foolhardy expedition.  This turns into an almost surreal adventure -- excursions to equatorial jungles must have represented to the Englishman of Waugh's time some kind of descent into hell -- and culminates in Tony's encounter with a jungle-dwelling crazy old coot whose illiteracy requires someone to stay and read to him -- and he's got a complete collection of Dickens novels.<br />The humor on which Waugh's reputation rests is in fine form here.  Some of it is so subtle it could easily be missed, such as Tony's consultations with the private detectives who are supposed to be catching him in the act of an infidelity for the divorce proceedings; some of it is outright hilarious, as displayed by a scene where a pickled Tony and his friend Jock patronize a den of iniquity called the Sixty-Four.  This is the best kind of social satire: funny, smart, occasionally vicious but never crude.	2002-07-01

The theory that it's a warning of science and technology going awry is, I think, an overstatement of its prophetic capacity.  Mary Shelley's novel does not appear to have much of an interest in science per se, and is less about creation than it is about the relationship between the creator and the created.<br />The novel's structure is indirect for reasons that become apparent at its end.  An English sea captain named Walton is writing letters to his sister, telling her about a man his ship has rescued from an abandoned ice floe on a polar expedition.  The man's name is Victor Frankenstein, and he commences to tell Walton his Long Story...<br />Intensely interested in science as a boy growing up in Geneva, Victor fulfilled his studies at a university and hoped to make some earth-shattering scientific breakthrough.  He decides that a fascinating project would be to find a way to re-animate the dead.  Collecting body parts from charnel houses and assembling them into a gigantic golem, he manages to bring this thing to life (refusing to disclose the scientific method).  Fearful and regretful of the powerful outcome of his experiment, he is relieved when the monster walks mutely and mindlessly out of his apartment, never to return.  Oddly enough, over the next two years, he is not concerned with where the monster has gone or what it is doing.<br />When his youngest brother, William, is murdered, Victor suspects his monster; vacationing in the Alps a few months later, he comes across the monster, who not only has learned to talk but has become quite eloquent.  The monster tells Victor that his many efforts to befriend people and enter into society have been spurned due to his frightening appearance, and his resulting loneliness and anger incited him to kill.  He insists that Victor, as his creator, has an obligation to provide him with a female companion, and demands that he make one for him.  However, Victor is unwilling to add to the population of violent creatures, and the monster takes his revenge out on even more of Victor's loved ones.  Distraught to the point of insanity, Victor turns vigilante and pursues the monster all over the world, swearing to destroy it once and for all.<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is an allegorical tale of creation and examines a creator's responsibility and accountability for his creation's deeds or misdeeds.  In this regard, Victor is essentially an irresponsible creator.  He is not concerned with his monster's whereabouts until after one of his siblings is murdered; he could have taken responsibility for his creature immediately upon creation, but shortsightedly chose not to.

I was a daisy-fresh girl, and look what you've done to me.  I ought to call the police and tell them you raped me.  Oh, you dirty, dirty old man.\\"<br />-- Thus the relationship between Dolores \\"Lolita\\" Haze, 12-year-old American vixen, and her stepfather/guardian/seducer/lover Humbert Humbert, writer, teacher, Parisian immigrant who embarks with her on a journey into the heartland of America and the sexual unknown.  An intriguing premise for a novel, to say the least, and one that has the potential for almost Oedipal levels of Greek tragedy; but \\"Lolita\\" is woven from completely original cloth -- provocative, funny, suspenseful, playful; a Russian novelist's celebration of the expanse of the English languague.<br />The novel is narrated in the first person by Humbert in a tone that deftly alternates between pedantic conceit and heartbreaking wistfulness.  It appears that he either has been or will be convicted of a capital crime and is addressing both the interested reader and his lost Lolita, who he knows will never read it.  He traces his attraction to \\"nymphets,\\" pre-teen girls with the uncommon libido to enchant older men, back to his first puppy love, Annabel, who died tragically young.  Since then, girls of Annabel's age have become his ideal of femininity and sexuality.<br />After an unsuccessful marriage, Humbert moves to New York to work for his uncle's business and remains on the prowl for nymphets.  A sojourn in New England brings him luck:  The house he is staying in, owned by a harpy-like widow named Charlotte Haze, contains the nymphet of his dreams, Charlotte's daughter Dolores (Lolita).  The attraction is mutual, unbeknownst to Mrs. Haze, who has her own eye on Humbert and a jealous, contentious attitude towards her daughter.  Mrs. Haze sends Lolita to summer camp and proposes marriage to Humbert, who accepts because it will keep him close to Lolita.<br />Mrs. Haze soon dies --never mind how for now -- leaving Humbert free to take his \\"hot downy darling\\" Lolita with him all over the country in Mrs. Haze's car, \\"Melmoth\\" (as in the Wanderer).  Their road trips are a tour through kitschy postwar Americana, while Humbert and Lolita consummate their love in various motel rooms.  They rent a house in a (different) New England town so Lolita can attend a private school, but eventually they hit the road again, this time pursued by a mysterious fellow in a red convertible -- a detective, or someone with a more sinister motive regarding Lolita?  Humbert's passion for her is so strong, so possessive, that any interference in their relationship could drive him to criminal acts of desperation.<br />Nabokov understands, better than most writers, what makes fiction fun, and he employs the right devices to secure the reader's interest.  For example, Nabokov is arguably the master of the art of foreshadowing; attentive readers will be able to connect current events to previous clues as the story continues to unfold.  A perverse but strangely personable narrator, a love story that raises eyebrows and avoids nauseating cliches, and imaginatively florid prose make \\"Lolita\\" an essential reading experience.	2002-06-24
US	49396726	R3ON0O3E2MTLP2	0060932139	104524934	The Unbearable Lightness of Being	Books	5	8	8	N	N	The fragility of existence	\\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\" is a novel enormously heavy in ideas, intelligence, and intensity, yet it doesn't weigh itself down with verbosity or obscure philosophy; it is unusual in the way it successfully balances erudition with narrative levity.  It is a very erotic novel, not in a tawdry or cheap way, but in a way that genuinely understands how important sex is in a relationship and why it is not always an act of love.  Part of the novel's tone is political; the setting is Czechoslovakia in the 1960's and 1970's, and as such, Communist oppressiveness drives much of the plot. <br />The principal character is a Prague surgeon named Tomas, who is divorced and isolated from his ex-wife and son.  He is a notorious womanizer, a man who believes that love and sexuality have nothing in common.  He continues his habit even after he marries a small-town waitress, named Tereza, with whom he fell in love.  One of his mistresses is an artist named Sabina, who in turn has an affair with a married Swiss professor named Franz.<br />The novel tells the stories of these four people: how they relate, how their lives developed, how they arrived at their attitudes about life, love, and sex.  Tereza used to take prudish offense at her mother's lewdness and sought escape through literature; Sabina's strongest link to her past is her grandfather's bowler hat.  Franz, as a diffident and studious youth, always longed to be an active member of society, which he accomplishes by joining the \\"Grand March,\\" a metaphorical parade of ideology, an expression of some form of political or social struggle.  <br />By 1968, democratic reforms were being gradually introduced into the Communist Czech government, prompting the Soviets, who perceived a security threat, to invade.  As a result, Tomas and Tereza flee to Zurich but eventually return to Prague, only to face the devastating effects of censorship:  Refusing to write a retraction for an anti-Communist letter he had sent to a local newspaper, Tomas is forced to resign his hospital position and is reduced to taking a job as a window washer.  <br />Referring to the title, the novel's main theme is that fate is so fragile and tenuous that existence becomes insubstantial.  Much of our \\"being\\" -- our physical, mental, social, and emotional states -- depends on our and others' decisions, impulses, and caprices; Tomas ponders that his meeting Tereza depended on six chance happenings, or accidents.  (It could be argued that his meeting Tereza depended, theoretically, on an infinite number of accidents.  This is what is commonly called \\"being in the right place at the right time.\\")  Therefore, does existence really mean anything when anything that exists, or any event that happens, could just as easily, through a different set of circumstances, not exist or not have happened?  <br />Kundera fashions the novel with a unique style and even a special lexicon.  Words like \\"weight,\\" \\"lightness,\\" \\"unbearable,\\" and \\"kitsch\\" are repeated in various contexts like motifs, as is Beethoven and his fatalistic \\"Es muss sein\\" (\\"It must be\\").  It could take many rereadings to absorb all the ideas in this novel, but that's what makes it the highest kind of literature -- a book that encourages questions, thoughts, and analysis.	2002-06-21

Its pacing is restless and energetic, which is all the more amazing considering that it has no plot.  I don't know how much of it is fiction, but it is obviously autobiographical and reads like a memoir, detailing its author's experiences living as an American expatriate in Paris in the 1920's.<br />Henry Miller is a bum (it must be admitted) living among the idle intellectuals in the seedier neighborhoods of Paris (might he have bumped into Hemingway?).  He's not always unemployed; he takes temporary jobs like a proofreader at a newspaper and an English instructor at a Lycee in Dijon, and he always has a place to live, albeit filthy.  Most of the time he's cavorting with friends, making new ephemeral acquaintances, visiting brothels, and engaging in the kind of promiscuity of which such a life avails itself, despite the fact that he has a wife back in America.  He doesn't shy away from any of the disgusting details of living and loving -- in the novel's opening scene, he is shaving his roommate's armpit hair for lice, and believe me, it only gets worse -- but Miller thrives in the squalor and wouldn't have it any other way.  Compared to his native New York, which he considers impersonal, cold, and hollow, Paris is warm and intimate, brimming with life and beauty.<br />&quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; is very similar to two popular books that followed it by a quarter of a century: Jack Kerouac's &quot;On the Road&quot; in content (run-on anecdotes about outrageous activities with his friends, pulsating with waves of existentialist rambling, the main difference being that Miller is a much better writer than Kerouac), and William S. Burroughs's &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; in style (stream-of-consciousness narration using striking imagery in random juxtaposition).  Miller possessed the spirit, if not the seed, of the Beat Generation -- his existence can be summarized in his self-description as &quot;spiritually dead, physically alive, morally free.&quot;<br />This is also perhaps the book's greatest fault -- its influence outstrips its literary quality.

On the surface, it is a spy story about anarchistic terrorists with elements of suspense and paranoia; as you dig a little deeper, a black comedy emerges; peeling back a few more layers reveals a philosophical underbelly; and it all ends in an uproariously enigmatic denouement worthy of Lewis Carroll.  If the book is, as its subtitle indicates, a nightmare, we all should hope to have dreams as sweet as this.<br />The hero, Gabriel Syme, is a poet-detective (yes, seriously) who works for a special branch of Scotland Yard dedicated to apprehending \\"intellectual\\" criminals, particularly anarchists, because they tend to be the most subversive and therefore the most dangerous.  By operating undercover as a poet-anarchist, Syme manages to infiltrate the seven-member Central Anarchist Council, who alias themselves using the names of the days of the week, and fills the vacant slot of \\"Thursday.\\"  The Council's main directive is to cast the world into chaos by assassinating heads of state, and their current plan, as masterminded by their president, \\"Sunday,\\" is to bomb the upcoming meeting of the Russian Czar and the French president in Paris.<br />It is, of course, up to Syme/Thursday, who is always at risk of being exposed as a policeman, to put a stop to this nefarious scheme, to which there is naturally more than meets the eye.  As the plot unfolds, it breaks down (or builds up) into an indescribably wild farce; Syme's mission turns into a picaresque adventure of disguises, a swordfight, and several chases -- involving horses, cars, an elephant, and a hot-air balloon.  At the end of the book, a surprise is waiting; a strange detachment from everything that has preceded it, which slyly lets the reader in on its symbolic joke.  If not for its relentlessly silly tone and idiosyncratic resolution, \\"The Man Who was Thursday\\" could be a perfect sister novel to Joseph Conrad's \\"The Secret Agent.\\"<br />Like fellow British wits Dickens, Wodehouse, and Waugh, Chesterton is that rare sort of writer who is skilled in combining breathtaking narrative with irreverent and intelligent comedy and whose prose is as poetical as it is humorous.

In this novel, V.S. Naipaul vividly and picturesquely describes Trinidad as a thriving but generally poor island populated by a strong Hindu community with a waning observance of the caste system and where, even well into the twentieth century, the most common mode of transportation is the bicycle.<br />Naipaul's titular protagonist, Mohun Biswas, was born a bad omen, declared by a pundit (Hindu scholar) to be the eventual downfall of his parents; the prophecy is seemingly fulfilled when his father accidentally dies because of his mischief.  After some brief schooling, Mr. Biswas (as he is called throughout the novel, even as a young boy) embarks on a series of odd jobs:  After an unsuccessful apprenticeship to a pundit, he is sent to work in a relative's rumshop and later becomes a sign-painter.  It is on this job that he meets a pretty girl named Shama, whose family, named Tulsi, owns many properties and businesses in Trinidad.  A marriage is arranged between Biswas and Shama, and he soon finds himself a prisoner of the Tulsi family in a way, a situation which becomes the basis for his lifelong struggle for independence.  <br />The Tulsis' house, called the Hanuman House, is crowded with members of Shama's extended family, including her mother, her uncle Seth, who manages much of the family's businesses, brothers, sisters, and innumerable and indistinguishable nieces and nephews -- living conditions which lead to irritation and violent arguments with in-laws.  The Tulsis give him a shop to run and a sugarcane field to oversee, but he lets deadbeats and workers take advantage of him.  His attempt to build his own house and move away from the Tulsis for good, with the help of an incompetent carpenter, ends in disaster.  <br />On his own initiative, he becomes a reporter for a Trinidad newspaper, the Sentinel, writing sensational and often embellished stories, interviewing &quot;Deserving Destitutes,&quot; and learning a new kind of creativity which grants him true vocational freedom from the Tulsis.  Meanwhile, Shama bears him four children, among whom there is only one son, Anand, whose fragile relationship with his father instills the novel with touching moments of realism.  <br />It's easy to empathize with Mr. Biswas, for he is a character of the most universal sort -- everyone can relate to his desire for autonomy, freedom, and independence.  He could be a symbol of the emancipation of a controlled people -- specifically, Indian independence from the British empire -- but the novel also succeeds on its surface level.  We know from the prologue that Mr. Biswas eventually does escape the Tulsis and obtain a house, a decrepit, boxlike affair that hardly seems like a personal triumph.  But it is *his* house, his declaration of independence, a final confirmation that he is indeed his own man.	2002-06-13

And Sinclair Lewis could hardly have picked a name more suggestive of rustic simplicity and provinciality than Gopher Prairie for the Minnesota town that is the setting of his novel.  Gopher Prairie is supposed to be a prototype of thousands of American small towns in the early decades of the twentieth century, paradise for those who like to cling comfortably to convention, unbearable for those who seek cultural refinement and artistic freedom.  <br />Lewis's protagonist is a bright, pretty, and progressive college-educated girl named Carol Milford who has great dreams of widespread social reform: educating children, aiding the poor, rebuilding and beautifying small towns.  Working as a librarian in St. Paul, she meets and falls in love with a visiting country physician named Will Kennicott, who convinces her to marry him and return with him to his native Gopher Prairie, fresh clay to be molded to her heart's delight.<br />Gopher Prairie turns out to be not much advanced from its days as a frontier settlement.  Populated primarily by farmers of Scandinavian descent and a gossipy, judgmental group of white collar townspeople, it is staunchly set in its conservative ways and not very receptive to ideas of change.  The town's cultural outlook is dictated by the whitebread tastes of the more outspoken and influential religious leaders, and Carol's efforts to instill a sense of higher culture and broaden people's horizons by starting a theatrical club and getting better books for the library are viewed with suspicion and ridicule.  Even Carol's own husband tends to have a nonchalant, dismissive attitude towards her plans.  The town's sole rebel is the handyman Miles Bjornstam, a self-described lone wolf and pariah, who likes to taunt the stuffed shirts in town with his defiant disregard for their money, his independence, and his atheistic and socialistic ideas.<br />Rather than let Carol conquer the town through perseverance, Lewis opts for realism by restraining his heroine's success.  After having a baby, she naturally becomes more domesticated and reluctantly gives herself up to the way of life in Gopher Prairie.  She has chances to rebel with potential extramarital affairs and a separation from her husband to move to (the less friendly and intimate) Washington, D.C., and get a job, but ultimately she returns to Gopher Prairie, realizing that life is about compromises, and changes and reforms take more time and organization than she has to offer.  While her dreams may not be completely fulfilled in her lifetime, there is hope in the future generations.   <br />&quot;Main Street&quot; is ambitious and bold but perhaps does not have quite the impact that Lewis intended.  He makes his point relatively early in the novel and spends the remainder of it spinning out variations on his theme of Carol vs. Gopher Prairie, relying on scenes connected episodically rather than on an arching plotline.  What Lewis lacks in narrative acumen, he more than makes up for in drawing distinctive characters and scripting sharp dialogue with a good ear for dialect.  When he coalesces this skill with a focused story and a strong social statement, as he does in his later, better novel &quot;Elmer Gantry,&quot; he proves himself to be a worthy rabble-rouser in American literature.	2002-06-07

He divides &quot;poetry,&quot; which could be defined as imitations of human experience, into tragedy, comedy, and epic, and explains the differences between these forms, although comedy is not covered in detail and tragedy gets the most treatment.  For one thing, tragedy, he states, seeks to imitate the matters of superior people, while comedy seeks to imitate the matters of inferior people.<br />To Aristotle, the most important constituent of tragedy is plot, and successful plots require that the sequence of events be necessary (required to happen to advance the story logically and rationally) and probable (likely to happen given the circumstances).  Any plot that does not feature such a necessary and probable sequence of events is deemed faulty.  Reversals and recognitions are plot devices by which tragedy sways emotions, particularly those that induce &quot;pity and fear,&quot; as is astonishment, which is the effect produced when the unexpected happens.  He discusses the best kinds of tragic plots, the kinds of characters that are required, and how their fortunes should change over the course of the plot for optimum tragic effect.<br />With regard to poetic language or &quot;diction,&quot; he emphasizes the importance of figurative language (metaphor, analogy) in poetry and the importance of balancing figurative with literal language.  It is his opinion that metaphoric invention is a natural ability and not something that can be taught.  Of all the poets Aristotle mentions who exemplify the ideals proposed in the &quot;Poetics,&quot; Homer draws the most praise.<br />Malcolm Heath's introduction in the Penguin Classics edition offers some helpful and amusing clarification and commentary on the &quot;Poetics,&quot; including a demonstration of the Aristotelian method of constructing a tragedyusing the story of Oedipus as an example.  A work that is scant in volume but rich in ideas, the &quot;Poetics&quot; demands to be read by all those interested in ancient thought on literature.	2002-05-31

At the same time, the novel is not about Americans frivolously sowing their wild oats in exotic ancestral lands, but rather how they use their new settings to break away from restrictive American traditions and conventions and redefine their values and standards of living.<br />The main character is a late-middle-aged widower named Lambert Strether who edits a local periodical in the town of Woollett, Massachussetts, and is a sort of factotum for a wealthy industrialist's widow named Mrs. Newsome, a woman he may possibly marry.  Strether's latest assignment from Mrs. Newsome is to go to Paris to convince her son, Chad, to give up what she assumes is a hedonistic lifestyle and return to Woollett to marry a proper, respectable young lady, his brother-in-law's sister to be specific.  There is a greater ulterior motive, too -- the prosperity of the family business relies on Chad's presence.<br />In Paris, Strether finds that Chad has surrounded himself with a more stimulating group of friends, including a mousy aspiring painter named John Little Bilham, and that he is in love with an older, married woman named Madame de Vionnet.  Providing companionship and counsel to Strether in Paris are his old friend, a retired businessman named Waymarsh, and a woman he met in England, named Maria Gostrey, who happens to be an old schoolmate of the Madame's.  When it appears that Strether is failing in his mission to influence Chad, Mrs. Newsome dispatches her daughter and son-in-law, Jim and Sarah (Newsome) Pocock, and Jim's marriageable sister Mamie, to Paris to apply pressure.  Ultimately, Strether, realizing that he's blown his chances with Mrs. Newsome and that Chad has the right idea anyway, finds himself enjoying the carefree life in Paris, which has liberated him from his lonely, stifling existence in Woollett.  <br />Not having cared much for James's previous work \\"The Wings of the Dove,\\" I felt something click with \\"The Ambassadors.\\"  Maybe it's because I found the story a little more absorbing and could empathize with Strether; maybe it's because my reading skills are maturing and I'm learning to appreciate James's dense, oblique prose style.  I realize now that, for all the inherent difficulty in his writing, literature took a giant step forward with Henry James; if the Novel is, as he claimed, \\"the most independent, most elastic, most prodigious of literary forms,\\" it takes a writer like James to show us how.	2002-05-29

For four of these tourists, however, this trip is more like a pilgrimage; each is at a point of spiritual or moral uncertainty in his or her life and is seeking some sort of redemption, closure, or significance.     <br />First we meet Isobe, an elderly man who recently has lost his wife to cancer.  Although skeptical at first, he now has hope that his wife has been reincarnated, and he has evidence he might find her in India.  Then there is Mitsuko, a woman who, when in college, seduced a pious Christian student named Otsu just for fun, to see if she could lure him away from his God; after an unhappy marriage she devoted her time to charitable hospital work and is now searching for Otsu, who she has heard is now a Catholic priest living in India.  Numada is a children's story writer who gets his inspiration from imagined communications with animals; recovering from tuberculosis, he comes to believe that a bird his wife bought for him as a pet died in place of him.  He has come to India to see the bird and animal sanctuaries.  Kiguchi is an ex-soldier who suffered horrible near-death experiences in World War II Burma; he has come to India to memorialize his fallen war comrades. <br />My feelings about this novel are divided.  On one hand, Endo's descriptions of Indian scenery and customs from the Japanese vantage point and the culture clash are excellent; he writes poignantly, if a little too sentimentally; and his hope for peace between the religions of the world is certainly noble.  (Repudiating Christianity's Eurocentrism, Otsu believes God can be found among all nations and religions.)  <br />On the other hand, the simplicity with which Endo presents his protagonists and their situations implies that the author is more interested in conveying his personal religious convictions thanin pure narrative invention.  His symbols of the divine (Otsu as a Christ-like savior, Gaston the hospital volunteer as an angel) are so transparent, they seem less like literary devices than arbitrary miraculous avatars, especially towards the end, where the novel's tone becomes increasingly didactic.  Case in point: The tour group includes a young married couple named the Sanjos, whose selfish, insensitive, and materialistic attitudes seem to represent the modern affluent Japan and what Endo feels is an arrogant, godless society.  Their speech and actions are too unrealistically annoying, too unconvincing, as though Endo were manipulatively trying to make his readers hate them and see his point.  This is some of the most contrived characterization I've seen in any novel meant to be read by adults.<br />\\"Deep River\\" is a nicely written novel of good intentions, but it is more craft than art, and it ultimately reads more like a laundry list of conventional religious platitudes than an enduring piece of literature.	2002-05-28

His writing is practically a celebration of how well Americans can live in Europe, how enticing are the cultures, and how exciting and liberating are the experiences.  \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" indicates that, after the horror and confusion of World War I, the \\"Lost\\" Generation seem to have found themselves quite at home outside of America living life to the fullest.  If F. Scott Fitzgerald's fiction suggests that only the wealthy can afford to be irresponsible, Hemingway suggests that anybody can afford to be irresponsible outside his or her own country.<br />The narrator, Jake Barnes, is a newspaper writer living in Paris in the 1920's.  His circle of friends consists almost exclusively of other writers and artists and their admirers, all of whom hang out in the cafes, indulge in the night life, and drink freely, heavily, and lavishly -- no pesky Prohibition on this side of the Atlantic.  Two of Jake's friends are Robert Cohn, a Jewish boxer-turned-novelist whose love affairs with women always seem to end messily, and the beautiful, desirable Lady Brett Ashley, who is about to divorce her husband and marry an obnoxious boor named Mike Campbell.<BR>  <BR>Jake takes a fishing trip to Spain with Cohn and his buddy Bill Gorton, after which they stay over in Pamplona to take in the San Fermin fiesta and watch the bullfights with Brett and Campbell.  Jake is not just a casual spectator, but a seasoned \\"aficionado\\" who is intimately familiar with the bullfighting scene.  As the partying continues, passions heat up, a drunken Campbell constantly picks on Cohn, who, like Jake, is infatuated with Brett, and Brett sets her sights on a hot new young matador named Pedro Romero.  Although these plot points seem like they're leading up to some big, explosive climax, Hemingway, who values realism over contrivances, chooses the high road and allows the characters to resolve their conflicts naturally, like human beings, not like Hollywood caricatures. <br />Hemingway's prose in this early novel of his is usually minimalistic but, with something like boyish enthusiasm, becomes more detailed and energetic when describing the things that really interest its author, like trout fishing and bullfighting.  That he manages to capture the intoxicating freedom of these expatriates so directly and concisely is what has made him one of America's greatest literary icons.	2002-05-21

Boccaccio's intention is to present a lively diversion to the reading public of the time, and he makes no apologies to those who would be easily offended by silliness, sexual innuendo, or unflattering portrayals of hypocritical, licentious clergymen.<br />The book's background is an eerie reflection of the time in which it was written.  Seven young ladies and three young men from Florence, Italy, depressed and frightened about the plague that is currently sweeping throughout the lands and taking large chunks out of the population, decide to escape to the countryside, camp out in vacant castles, and tell each other stories to distract themselves from the horrors of the plague and bide their time until it passes. <br />Each of them tells a story per day for ten days -- one hundred stories total -- and each day has an established theme which the stories told that day must follow.  The stories are simple fables about love, adultery, deception, generosity, and fortune, in which stupid or gullible people are fooled, selfish people are cheated, arrogant people get their comeuppance, and smart, honest, or virtuous people are rewarded.  Running the gamut from farcically ridiculous to decadently ribald to melodramatically sad, they are apparently the kinds of stories people back then probably would have found entertaining.<br />Because of the unifying daily themes, the stories on any given day can start to seem homogeneous after a while, so it would not be unreasonable to skip some.  Don't take that comment as a slight against Boccaccio's accomplishment, though.  If we must look to the ages for wisdom, we should be pleased and grateful to find this 700-year-old pre-Renaissance book, which serves as a reminder that humor is, and always has been, an effective drug to numb the pain from even the worst tragedies and catastrophes.	2002-05-20
US	49396726	R36DL40S1YP7NR	0460871919	751067545	Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Everyman's Library)	Books	5	16	17	N	N	A story of the silver coast	Joseph Conrad is one of the most effortlessly cosmopolitan writers in the English language, and &quot;Nostromo&quot; finds him in a fictitious South American country called Costaguana whose mountains are a bountiful resource of silver.  And Conrad is probably the only writer who can transform his novel's hero from an all-around tough guy to a heroic savior to a sneaky thief to a tragic victim of mistaken identity through plausible twists of fate without ever letting the story fall into disarray.  <br />The main action of the novel takes place towards the end of the nineteenth century in a town called Sulaco, which is the base of operations for the San Tome silver mine up in the nearby mountains.  The administrator of the mine is an Englishman named Charles Gould, whose primary challenge is to find American and European speculators to invest money to keep the mine in business.  The other problem he faces is a civil war between the present government and a faction of rebels led by a general named Montero.  Gould's wife Emilia is a prominent figure in town, an elegant matron with a philanthropic attitude towards the downtrodden native mine workers and townspeople.    <br />The hero, Nostromo, is an Italian sailor who settled in Costaguana for more lucrative work and is now in charge of keeping the dockworkers -- the &quot;cargadores&quot; -- in line.  When Montero's troops invade Sulaco, Nostromo and Martin Decoud, an aristocratic Frenchman who runs Sulaco's newspaper, escape on a boat with the town's silver treasury to protect it from the marauders.  Their boat is sideswiped and damaged by a ship commanded by a rebel colonel named Sotillo, and they are forced to moor on a nearby island and bury the treasure there.  This island is the future site of a lighthouse to be maintained by the Violas, an Italian family whose patriarch, Giorgio, once supported Garibaldi and still reveres the man like a deity.  There is obviously much more to the plot, too much to reveal in thisreview, and there are many additional important characters, but these are best left for the potential reader to discover.<br />Narratively, Conrad keeps the story moving with plenty of action and suspense combined with the typical excellence of his prose.  Structurally, though, is how Conrad's novel intrigues its reader:  He frequently shifts viewpoints, in both place and time, to give the effect of different perspectives of both the immediate events and the long-term history of Sulaco.  Contemporary reviewers of the novel apparently saw this technique as an artistic flaw; in retrospect, it seems well ahead of its time.<br />Thematically, the novel presents a debate about the benefits and problems of imperialism and colonization, using Costaguano as a model colony and the Gould Concession as model imperialists.  When Sotillo accuses foreigners of robbing his country of its wealth, Gould suggests to him that a country's resources (i.e., Costaguana's silver) can be used as an asset only from the cooperation of the native workers and the capital and technical knowledge of the colonists.  Such a concept seems relevant to global economic development throughout the twentieth century.	2002-05-14
US	49396726	R1S63BIXMET5M5	0452275725	978016456	World's Fair	Books	5	27	28	N	N	A wistful novel of nostalgia	E.L. Doctorow is probably New York's greatest literary nostalgia artist.  While \\"Ragtime\\" recalls the city's colorful population explosion of immigrants at the beginning of the twentieth century and \\"Billy Bathgate\\" is a boy's Depression-era underworld fantasy, \\"World's Fair\\" evokes what it might have been like to grow up in the Bronx in the 1930's.  The narrator, Doctorow's voice and presumed alter ego, is a Jewish boy named Edgar Altschuler who is about nine by the time the book ends, so it remains in a state of pre-pubescent innocence without entering into the turbulent years of adolescent awakening.<br />Edgar is an extremely observant child who is fascinated by the intricacies of the most mundane things and events.  Normal kid routines like school, ball games, movies, comic books, and radio programs are described in loving detail as though he were eager to explain to his jaded adult readers what's so special about being a kid.  Similarly, tragedies like the death of his grandmother, witnessing a woman getting hit by a car, and meeting terminally ill children in the hospital take on perceptively morbid new dimensions through Edgar's words. <br />The members of Edgar's immediate family are so realistic they seem like sepia-tinted photographs come to life.  His father Dave co-owns a music store and, far from being the moral compass a father's role is traditionally given, is somewhat irresponsible and irreverent, a social activist about thirty years ahead of his time.  Edgar's mother Rose is a bundle of anxiety, worrisome and contentious from living in a house full of men.  His older brother, Donald, and uncle Willy are both musically inclined, one a failed bandleader, the other destined to be a failed bandleader.<BR> <BR>That Edgar is Jewish is an indispensable part of the story, as it defines his upbringing and characterizes his family, friends, and the neighborhood.  From his strictly observant maternal grandmother to his atheistic paternal grandfather, there isa wide range of piety among his family members, which makes for lively scenes at rituals such as the Passover Seder.  Nothing, however, raises the little boy's Jewish consciousness so much as the appearances of swastika graffiti in the neighborhood, threats from antisemitic hooligans, and Hitler's menacing shadow looming across the ocean.<br />Edgar's bittersweet final taste of youthful innocence is his long-anticipated and enthusiastic first visit to the 1939 World's Fair, an ironic symbol of man's proud achievements in the technological advancements of civilization considering the world was getting ready to destroy itself in war.  The book ends with Edgar burying a time capsule in a nearby park in imitation of the one buried at the Fair, and it becomes apparent that this novel is meant to be Doctorow's personal time capsule.  <br />Things we experience as children can be confusing and difficult to understand in all their aspects, but as adults we are able to articulate our thoughts and feelings about our childhood experiences with fresh insights that we didn't have at the time.  That Doctorow does this so delicately and poetically in \\"World's Fair\\" makes his novel an absolute success.	2002-05-03

Cain's brand of noir in \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" is concerned more with the drama behind the crime than with the investigation of it.  <br />The novel begins with a flurry of premonitions:  A dangerous young drifter named Frank Chambers stops for a bite to eat at a California roadside lunchroom owned by an affable but naive Greek named Nick Papadakis and his much younger, beautiful wife Cora.  Frank accepts a job offer from Nick and almost immediately begins an affair with Cora, who confides to Frank that Nick disgusts her and she feels trapped in her marriage.  She suggests that the only way out is to kill Nick, and Frank, who really doesn't have anything personal against his new boss, decides to go along with it.<br />After a false start, Frank and Cora finally manage to carry out their crime, although not without a significant amount of bodily sacrifice.  Of course they tell the police that Nick's death was an accident, but the District Attorney is suspicious of the circumstances -- particularly when it is discovered that Nick had a considerable insurance policy on his life.  From this point on, Cain uses the principle of poetic justice to ensure that Frank and Cora pay for their crime through their arrogance and foolishness.<br />Frank, Cora, and Nick make an interesting love triangle.  Situations in their lives seem to have brought them together partially because of their relative stupidity -- for a guy who's spent his life on the road, Frank shows he even lacks street smarts when he gets suckered by an obvious pool shark; indeed, a story like this relies on fundamentally stupid characters.  Nick, of course, never suspects his wife is having an affair; he's just a simple immigrant who's proud and grateful to be living the American dream of owning his own business.  The smartest character turns out to be Cora's lawyer, Katz, who probably guesses the truth about Nick's \\"accident\\" right away but knows he'll make out like a bandit no matter what happens to his client.<br />The characterization, mood, and style of this novel reveal the source of noir fiction:  When the corruption and violence of the '20s erupted into the squalor and desperation of the Depression of the '30s, noir must have emerged naturally as the time's most representative artistic expression.  Here we have characters who are so poor and hopeless that they're desperate enough to do anything and violent enough to turn to crime.	2002-04-30

A charmer from the very first paragraph, &quot;If on a Winter's Night a Traveler&quot; makes readers feel good about reading and writers feel good about writing.<br />Never have I read a book that communicates with and understands its reader so well.  Writers like Nabokov and Pynchon like to have fun with their readers by posing literary puzzles, but here Calvino empathizes with the avid reader's feelings of frustration from interruptions, expectations, academic blathering, and personal efforts to reflect on literature. <br />The protagonist of this novel is none other than you yourself, the reader.  The novel is about the protagonist's (i.e., your) attempt to finish reading the novel that you have started.  However, problems keep cropping up, obstructing you from your goal: misprintings, mixups, interruptions, paramilitary operations, incarceration.  Joining you in your quest is Ludmilla, a woman you met in the bookstore and whom you would like to date.  Ludmilla has a sister, Lotaria, a feminist who thinks literature should be used to further her polemic agenda and represents the kind of &quot;ideological cheerleading&quot; for which critic Harold Bloom has so much disdain.  Ludmilla, on the other hand, represents the perfect passive reader who reads for purely escapist purposes.<br />The novel's structure is entirely original and somewhat difficult to describe.  It consists of two sets of alternating chapters; one set narrates your search for the missing remainder of the novel, and the other set consists of fragments of other novels you mistakenly pick up in your search.  Each of these &quot;other&quot; novels is a brilliant piece of writing in its own right, each by a different fictitious author and witha distinctive plot and style.  Just as you're becoming engrossed in whatever novel you're reading at a certain time, another interruption occurs, forcing you to resume your worldwide odyssey.<BR> <BR>This may sound like a frustrating reading experience, but it's actually a lot of fun, as Calvino demonstrates that starting a new &quot;novel&quot; saves an old plot thread from wearing out.  And just when things seem to start spinning out of control for the hapless protagonist (i.e., you, remember?), Calvino brings it all together in a narrative masterstroke that summarizes what all fiction is really about, which hasn't changed much since ancient times: it is simply about telling a story that hasn't happened in real life.	2002-04-30
US	49396726	R1WESEBW5JG0G8	0140430571	608778610	Erewhon (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	34	36	N	N	Nowhere in particular	Samuel Butler does a neat balancing act with &quot;Erewhon,&quot; a novel that is equal parts fictitious travelogue, philosophical tract, social/political/religious satire, and adventure story complete with a romantic subplot.  The protagonist, a young Englishman named Higgs who is unsatisfied with employment prospects in his home country, moves to a distant colonized land where he takes a job as a shepherd.  Beyond a mountain range there lie some mysterious lands that he would like to explore, and, setting out one day with a timid guide who later abandons him, he eventually gets to the other side of the peaks and finds himself in an isolated country named Erewhon.<br />One of the first things Higgs notes is that Erewhon is a few hundred years behind the times technologically.  They have no modern mechanical conveniences, and when Higgs is discovered to own a watch, it is confiscated and he is put in prison.  Later released and placed into the custody of a rich man named Mr. Nosnibor, Higgs learns all about the bizarre customs and beliefs of the Erewhonians.  <br />In Erewhon, sickness is punishable by law and criminal acts are treated medically by people called &quot;straighteners&quot;; so, stealing a pair of socks is analogous to feeling a bit under the weather.  The Erewhon banking system is a facade, as their money is worthless.  The Erewhonians believe in an ethereal prenatal world where babies are given the (preferred) option not to be born into the mortal world.  Their institutions of higher education, the Colleges of Unreason, teach conformity and resist originality and progress.  Most importantly, they condemn technological advancement because of the fear that machines will continue evolving so rapidly that they will eventually develop a consciousness, out-evolve man, and take control of the world.  Imagine how the Erewhonians would have despaired over the realization of artificial intelligence!<br />How have the Erewhonians arrived at all of these beliefs?  Higgs concludes that their belief system is a result of gullibility -- they tend to put their faith in anybody who comes up with a convincing argument for whatever agenda he's trying to push.  They don't analyze, question, or challenge; they just accept the status quo until somebody with a big mouth (but not necessarily a big brain) decides the status quo needs to be changed.  In this way, one man who thinks killing animals is wrong convinces the people to become vegetarians; another man who likes meat convinces the people that killing plants is an even greater sin.   <BR> <BR>This book has a lot of targets, some not all that obvious, but I think Butler was prophesying a world in which demagoguery takes the place of common sense and reason, a world through which he was satirizing organized religion, sentimental notions of familial sanctity, and the complacency of the Victorian middle class.  I've also read &quot;The Way of All Flesh,&quot; but I find &quot;Erewhon&quot; to be a better representative of Butler's skewering cynicism and sly humor.	2002-04-25

It is a Western in the sense of where and when it takes place, but what it portrays is nothing less than a vision of a nightmare world, the ultimate confirmation of man's sadistic potential for evil.<br />The novel takes place in the American Southwest and northern Mexico in the middle of the nineteenth century.  Local governments are paying gangs of mercenaries to hunt down and scalp Indians, mostly Apaches, who are considered a dangerous menace to the settlers.  The \\"hero\\" of the story is a scruffy, pugnacious, Tennessee-born teenager known only as the kid, who, after proving his skull-smashing mettle, is recruited into a renegade military regiment on Indian-scalping missions.  After an ill-fated encounter with some Comanches, the kid joins another gang headed by a man named Glanton, a merciless brute who performs his job with such insane bloodlust and inspires such rowdiness in his gang that the residents of Chihuahua wonder if maybe the Indians aren't better after all.<br />The most physically striking and imaginatively fascinating member of Glanton's gang is a hairless giant named Judge Holden.  When we first meet him in the novel, he gives the impression of a charming trickster when he debunks a phony preacher he's never even seen before.  However, as the novel proceeds, we learn that he is something of a Renaissance man -- scholar, artist, philosopher, natural scientist -- even while he is every bit as coldhearted a killer as Glanton himself.  By the end of the novel, we realize that he may be something more than just human, a living manifestation of the endless cycle of war and death.<br />McCarthy's writing style, with its masterful descriptions of scenery, strong narrative dynamics, and Faulkneresque flair for dramatic scene building, elevates \\"Blood Meridian\\" to the highest plane of literary art.  Two scenes in particular stand out to me as masterpieces of storytelling:  The first is the appearance of the Comanches in Chapter IV; McCarthy's description of the attackers is genuinely frightening, a nightmarish depiction of a diabolical masquerade of costumed demons.  The second scene, in Chapter XIX, is (Glanton gang member) David Brown's visit to a blacksmith in San Diego with a request to saw off the barrels of a shotgun; the dialogue and the unexpected but realistic outcome of this scene is, again, very reminiscent of Faulkner.<br />Excessive violence in a novel (or a movie, for that matter) can become cartoonish just from sheer overkill, but McCarthy writes so well that every gunshot, arrow wound, knife stab, and axe cleave seems not gratuitous but necessitated by the requirements of realism and historical accuracy.  In fact, the violence is so rampant and relentless that the cold hard fact of its eternal ubiquity seems to be the novel's main thematic element, relegating to the background any hackneyed statement that might be made about the horrors of man's inhumanity to man.	2002-04-22

It is a society and a time in which a person's influence is directly proportional to his or her wealth, and this novel is about how the vicious circle of such a society decides the fate of one particular girl. <br />The heroine, Lily Bart, comes from a wealthy family, but her father had fallen into ruin just before his death, and now she is impecunious and living with her strident aunt, Mrs. Peniston.  Ten years ago, she lost her chance to marry an Italian prince; now, approaching thirty and still single, she drifts through New York society attending dinners, playing bridge, and looking for money to marry -- one thing the novel makes clear is that there is nothing worse than being a Society Woman without money.  Despite her financial situation, she retains her snobbishness and is addicted to the luxury provided by this society in which she was raised, even though she is frankly bored with most of the people in it.  <br />Lily's precarious position renders her vulnerable to the more predatory members of the society.  One \\"friend,\\" Bertha Dorset, invites her to the Riviera for a vacation, but her real intention is for Lily to distract her husband's attention from her extramarital affair; Lily, in turn, is falsely accused of seducing Mr. Dorset and plunged into further shame.  Another of Lily's married friends, Gus Trenor, under the pretext of helping her invest what little money she has, gives her some financial aid in the hope that she will give him a little something else in return.  To repay her debt to him, she regretfully considers marrying the very wealthy and very repugnant Simon Rosedale. <br />A man Lily does love is Lawrence Selden, a lawyer, who moves in the samesocial circles as she, but he doesn't have much money nor does he care for the society people.  She's also interested in Percy Gryce, a handsome but shy book collector, but she doesn't move fast enough to save him from becoming engaged to another girl.  When financial circumstances finally force Lily to take a menial millinery job to make ends meet, we can sympathize with her because she has done nothing foolish to deserve her fate and accepts it with the dignity she deems appropriate for her bygone social status.  <br />What impressed me most about the novel is the intricate beauty of Wharton's prose, which is not only descriptively excellent with moments of sly and caustic humor, but conveys the characters' moods and motives with unthinkable subtlety.  Was Wharton trying to stick a dagger into the society she knew so well, the one from which she derived her entire lifestyle?  With her pen, the strange, unique social mentality in which people may find themselves torn between a fraternal obligation to \\"take care\\" of a friend and a snobbish urge to expel her from a society to which she can no longer afford to belong, becomes a great subject for literary commentary.	2002-04-17

Chronologically and artistically, his fiction is a sort of literary bridge between Tchaikovsky-era romanticism and Stravinsky-era chaos.  Unlike Dostoevsky, he did not delve deeply into man's problems in dealing with society; he did not have any overt political or religious agenda; hot-button issues like socialism and anti-semitism are barely given a nod.  A physician himself, he often used doctors as characters, marveling at their ability to mend bodies but not souls.  <br />In Chekhov's stories, marriage is hardly a bed of roses, usually resulting in discontentment, depression, and adultery; nowhere is this more perfectly executed than in \\"The Lady with the Dog,\\" which ends with the two transgressors not contrite over their sins, but resolving to carry on their affair in the face of uncertainty.  In \\"The Party,\\" a young married couple's disharmony culminates in a tragedy that underscores their need to love each other.  Chekhov's characters tend to marry for the wrong reasons, like societal pressure, false hopes of marital bliss (\\"The Helpmate,\\" \\"Betrothed\\"), and convenience and mutual benefit (\\"Anna on the Neck\\").  His characters usually are people who mean well but do the wrong things:  In \\"At a Country House,\\" a cultural elitist has a habit of scaring off the very men he wants his daughters to marry.  <br />Chekhov also touches on themes of pure, often unrequited, love.  \\"The Beauties\\" is a plaintive tale of infatuation, of a boy's enthralling first discovery of intangible feminine beauty.  His lonely characters, such as in \\"The Schoolmistress,\\" \\"A Doctor's Visit,\\" and \\"The Darling,\\" are often prisoners of their own inhibitions, obsessions, and self-obligations.   <br />Other topics are covered, often exhibiting a world-weary cynicism.  In theamusing fable \\"The Shoemaker and the Devil,\\" the protagonist's conclusion is not the cliched lesson to be thankful for the few things he has in life, but rather that there is nothing in life worth selling his soul to the devil for.  \\"Rothschild's Fiddle\\" is like a Marc Chagall painting set to prose, portraying the futility and bitterness of life offset by the beauty of art, while \\"Whitebrow\\" is a fuzzy parable.  Chekhov also displays a talent for drawing comical characters, such as the talkative blowhard in \\"The Petchenyeg\\" and the prudish protagonist of \\"The Man in a Case.\\"  A mark of Chekhov's style is that these people often are oblivious to their own idiosyncrasies, a touch that injects as much comedy as tragedy into the stories.<br />These stories might leave one with the impression that Chekhov was pessimistic about love and marriage, and even life, but in my opinion they emphasize a fundamental truism about fiction -- much as in comedy, where failure is funnier than success, even though \\"good\\" love is what makes the world go around, \\"bad\\" love is more interesting to write about.	2002-04-15

In fact, it seems to suggest that the highest state of humanity is a result of the peaceful coexistence of ideas and images.<br />The novel takes place in Germany, evidently some time in the late Middle Ages.  Narcissus (the Apollonian) is a stoic young monk who teaches at a cloister called Mariabronn.  One day a very handsome boy named Goldmund (the Dionysian) is dropped off at Mariabronn by his father to get a religious upbringing.  Goldmund is artistic and takes his studies seriously enough, but he is obsessed with thoughts of his departed mother, an issue over which he and Narcissus become close friends.  As he grows older, Goldmund realizes that he does not have much use for a monastic life, especially when he discovers the carnal pleasures of the opposite sex.  With Narcissus's reluctant approval, he decides to run away from the cloister and blindly follow his passions.<br />Goldmund wanders around the countryside for many years as a vagrant.  A regular Lothario, he survives by pleasuring the various women and girls he meets in every village and homestead.  Although living this way makes him tough, even enough to kill a man when provoked, he retains his religious and artistic sensibilities and a certain compassion for the defenseless and the innocent.  Impressed by a wooden madonna he sees in a church one day, he seeks out the sculptor who created it and requests to study under him.  Goldmund eventually develops into a skillful artist himself, and, eventually returning to Mariabronn, he uses his skill to create wonderful wood carvings and statues for the cloister.<br />It would appear that Goldmund's life comes full circle by the end of the novel, but his years of wandering permanently alter the convictions he developed as a youth.  He tells Narcissus that he can never take religious vows because, while he can accept poverty, he can't abide chastity or obedience.  His belief that God has made the world \\"badly\\" stems from his experiences during the Black Plague that lays waste to the population:  Stopping in a church once, he addresses God with a question that must have been on the minds of many people back then:  \\"...Are you completely disgusted with your creation, do you want us all to perish?\\"<br />More lucid and coherent than Hesse's more popular opus \\"Steppenwolf,\\"  \\"Narcissus and Goldmund\\" is a great soul-searching type of novel, one that allows a reader, especially a young one, to confront questions about his or her own life.  If we consider that Narcissus and Goldmund represent the two extremes of humanity -- Narcissus, the \\"perfect\\" Apollonian, and Goldmund, the \\"perfect\\" Dionysian (although admittedly there are even more extreme forms of passion than what Goldmund exhibits) -- we might be able to recognize that most of us fall somewhere in the middle; our satisfaction in life lies in finding out where in the middle we are most comfortable.ctions he developed as a youth.

It is so deep as to invite a world of interpretation, yet so mysterious as to defy any attempts at interpreting it.  I think it's brilliant just for its imagery -- who can forget the monstrous execution device of \\"In the Penal Colony,\\" or the description of the boy's festering wound in \\"A Country Doctor,\\" or the bouncing balls that torment the protagonist of \\"Blumfeld, an Elderly Bachelor,\\" or the dead, river-bound title character of \\"The Hunter Gracchus\\" who is lost in limbo between this world and the next, or the animalistic recluse of a man obsessed with defending his home from intruders, both real and imaginary, in \\"The Burrow\\"?  Kafka's use of symbolism, especially his use of animals as symbols representing various types of human experience, is unparalleled; it's easy to see the enormous influence he had on writers as diverse as Jorge Luis Borges, Thomas Mann, and Flannery O'Connor.<br />But I don't feel Kafka's goal was to shock his readers or influence future generations of writers.  He was just a 9-to-5 insurance guy with unique outlooks on life and the world and who developed an original, if occasionally grim and morbid, language for expressing them.  If a writer's fiction is supposed to reflect his personality, then in Kafka's case we get a distinct picture of a man who struggled every day of his life with his efforts to write, his alienation from his family (\\"The Metamorphosis\\"), his difficult relationship with his father (\\"The Judgment\\"), his religious feelings, his Jewish identity (\\"Josephine the Singer,\\" of particular poignancy coming from someone whose sisters were later to die in the concentration camps), his victim status (\\"The Vulture\\"), the absurdity of being an artist trying to communicate with an apathetic or misunderstanding public (\\"A Hunger Artist\\"), man's search for the divine and order in the universe (\\"Investigations of a Dog\\").  <br />From a technical standpoint, it must be stated that Kafka was not a perfect writer; many of the stories are structurally flawed and seem inexplicably truncated or unnecessarily lengthened.  Ascribing the shortcomings to expressionistic recklessness, however, I'd rather focus on the dark beauty of the images, even though I don't expect to understand them any better than I could know the man himself.	2002-03-29

Corrupting every convention of traditional drama, defying every expectation of the audience, it is exactly the \\"anti-play\\" its subtitle suggests. <br />In \\"The Lesson,\\" an aging professor's excessive zeal for a particular subject, made incomprehensibly esoteric by his own obsessive study of it, is the downfall of many a hapless student.<br />\\"Jack\\" is the age-old story of a boy who disappoints his family by not wanting to marry the girl they have selected for him, but, like a surrealist painting, the proceedings are rendered grotesque by nonsensical lines and colors.  As though to accentuate the banality of the underlying plot, the actors go to dramatic extremes as if they were acting out a \\"real\\" drama. <br />But I feel that the most engaging of the four plays is \\"The Chairs,\\" in which two actors not only must play a nonagenarian couple hosting a roomful of people who have assembled for a lecture, but must pantomime the presence of the (invisible) guests.  The bitterly ironic (and very funny) \\"lecture\\" given at the end affirms MacBeth's notion that life truly is a tale told by an idiot.  <br />I think these plays are more about form than content, as Ionesco is experimenting with visual and verbal imagery and challenging the audience's sense of comfort with the theater, intending to evoke unusual and unpleasant emotions like awkwardness or embarrassment.  To get the most out of reading the plays, it is best not to read them as literature but to visualize them being performed, paying close attention to every detail in the stage directions and the instructed mannerisms of the characters.	2002-03-25

This novel is pure fun even at its apocalyptic extreme. <br />The narrator (\\"Jonah,\\" as in trapped in the belly of a whale) is a journalist who plans to write a book about August 6, 1945, the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.  Particularly he is interested in the life of the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the principal scientists who worked on the bomb.  After corresponding with Hoenikker's midget son Newt, he interviews fellow scientists at Hoenikker's place of employment, a think tank called the General Forge and Foundry Company.  Jonah learns that one of the last things Hoenikker was working on was something called \\"ice-nine,\\" a substance which freezes water at temperatures much higher than 32°F. <br />Then Jonah gets an assignment to interview a philanthropist named Julian Castle who runs a charity hospital on a Caribbean island called San Lorenzo.  On the plane to San Lorenzo, Jonah happens to meet Newt and his horse-faced sister Angela who are on their way to the same destination to attend the wedding of their brother Frank, who happens to be a high-ranking official on the island, to a beautiful native girl named Mona, the adopted daughter of \\"Papa\\" Monzano, the island's dictator.<br />Arriving at San Lorenzo, Jonah finds out that all the islanders practice an outlawed religion called Bokononism, started by a calypso singer named Bokonon.  Bokononism is in a constant state of development as its founder thinks of new things to write about, but its main attribute seems to be a sort of shoulder-shrugging fatalism supported by well-meaning but useless aphorisms, a playful lexicon, and a bizarre foot ritual.  Frank offers Jonahthe Presidency of San Lorenzo upon Monzano's imminent death, simply because no one else wants the job.  Unfortunately, a few stray samples of ice-nine and an ill-fated air show spell disaster for not only Jonah's lucrative new position, but the world.<br />Note the modern implications of what the defense industry today calls \\"technology transfer\\" -- sure, ice-nine kills every living thing that touches it, but it has practical uses like solidifying muddy roads for military operations.  As Vonnegut feels that writers are society's canaries in a coal mine, this novel is like a big red flashing warning signal to the powers that be, not that they'd heed it, and besides, it's too late already.  What else is there to do but laugh?	2002-03-20

As much a social comedy as a personal tragedy, it taps into the same kinds of emotions and desires that have shaped Western society for the past 150 years -- ambition, lust, escapism.  It is a depressing novel whose heroine is so thoroughly unsympathetic that you read it to find out if she gets what she deserves.<br />Emma Rouault's misfortune is that she grew up with unrealistic expectations about life.  As a girl, she indulged herself in romantic novels and developed maudlin and almost fantastical notions of what love and marriage must be like.  She accepts the proposal of a socially awkward widower and doctor named Charles Bovary, even though she does not seem to have much genuine love for him.  In accordance with her fantasies, their wedding is straight out of a fairy tale.<br />The fairy tale doesn't last long.  Emma soon finds herself bored by her husband's spartan lifestyle and annoyed by his occasional professional ineptitude.  Shameful of what she perceives to be her low social status as a country doctor's wife, she is attracted by the glamor of big cities and high society she reads about in the fashionable magazines.  She dutifully takes care of her household, but she is selfish, temperamental, and mean to her servants and her baby daughter.  What's pathetic about her is that she wants to experience the kind of love she's read about in her books, but her personality is so antithetical to what love is that she will never be able to understand or appreciate it in its purest form.<br />After the Bovarys move to a small rural town called Yonville, Emma's beauty and charm attract the flirtatious attentions of several men in town, including two with whom she succumbs to adultery: Leon, a young law clerk, with whom she carries on an affair in the nearby city of Rouen under the guise of taking piano lessons; and the suave but sleazy Rodolphe who, impudently (and correctly) calculating her husband to be a naive dullard, uses her and throws her away like the tramp that she is.  In the course of her webs of deceipt and her taste for expensive, fashionable things, she drives herself and her husband into irreparable debt with morbidly tragic conclusions.<br />The characterization of the Yonville townsfolk is so rich that whole other novels could be written about them.  In particular there is the garrulous pharmacist Monsieur Homais, a neo-Voltaire type of character who disdains the clergy and has faith in science and a morality based on common sense.  Such characterization provides a comic counterbalance to Emma's majestically tragic figure; I've seen the same kind of thing in novels by Balzac and Thomas Hardy, where the unwashed masses are always there in the background, reassuring us that the world, on average, goes on the way it always has even while the main characters are front and center playing out their little dramas.pudently (and correctly) calculating her husband to be a naive dullard, uses her and throws her away like the tramp that she is.

The plot is simple:  Hrothgar, King of the Danes, is unable to defend his people from the attacks of a monster called Grendel.  Beowulf decides to help Hrothgar and sails from Geatland (an area that is now southern Sweden) to Denmark to fight Grendel.  After making short work of the beast, Beowulf is rewarded handsomely by the Danes, but then he has to answer to Grendel's mother, who has come to avenge the death her son.  Beowulf chases her to her underwater lair and beheads her, winning even more acclaim from the Danes.  <br />Beowulf sails back home, where he becomes the king of the Geats after his uncle and nephew are slain in battle.  Fifty years pass, and a dragon begins to terrorize the Geats after an item is stolen from its treasure hoard.  (So that's where Tolkien got the main idea for \\"The Hobbit.\\")  Beowulf, ever the protector of his people, goes to fight the dragon and manages to kill it but is mortally wounded in the combat, partially due to the cowardice of his retinue.  The Geats burn his body in a funeral pyre, fearful that now their leader is gone they will be easy prey for their enemies the Swedes, Franks, and Frisians.<br />An interesting point about Beowulf's character is what Heaney refers to in the Introduction as the \\"Germanic warrior code\\":  Everything Beowulf does has a sense of fairness and honor about it.  When he learns that Grendel does not use weapons, he puts aside his sword and chooses to fight the beast barehanded; when he prays to God before the fight, he asks that \\"the Divine Lord in His wisdom grant the glory of victory to whichever side He sees fit\\" rather than victory be given prejudicially to himself.  He feels that honor must be earned through bravery and that it's better to avenge the murder of loved ones than to mourn their loss.  Also interesting are the Biblical references that reflect the poet's Christianity; for example, it is mentioned that Grendel is, like all monsters, a descendant of the murderous Cain of the Old Testament.<br />The Introduction is every bit as entertaining as the poem itself.  Heaney explains how instead of doing a literal translation, he was careful to choose words for their alliteration and accentuation to make the epic sound like a poem in modern English; he also makes liberal use of modern idioms for the sake of clarity.  By Heaney's skill, the past ten or twelve centuries shrink away and the curtain is drawn back from a window that gives us an authentic medieval view.	2002-03-12
US	49396726	R87L0N5YO72OG	0060955228	535077019	Under the Volcano (Perennial Classic.)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Day of the Dead	Geoffrey Firmin, the protagonist of \\"Under the Volcano,\\" is the most convincing drunk I've encountered in literature, but the book isn't even about his drinking; his alcoholism is the symptom, not the disease.  The disease is his self-isolation, his inability to give and accept love, and, in broader scope, the world's increasing chaos and man's dehumanization over the course of the first half of the twentieth century.  <BR> <BR>Firmin is the British Consul of Quauhnahuac, a town in southern Mexico deep in the heart of volcanic mountain ranges and the remnants of ancient Indian civilizations.  The novel recounts the events on the last day of Firmin's life, which happens to be the festive Day of the Dead in 1938.  England has recently severed its diplomatic ties with Mexico and is recalling all their consuls, so he has no reason to stay except to drink his life away in the town's many cantinas.  <BR> <BR>Firmin's excessive drinking has caused his wife Yvonne, a former movie actress, to leave him, but she still loves him and has come back to town hopefully to take him away and save his life.  Her timing is not perfect because Firmin's half-brother Hugh, a failed songwriter, international drifter, and now a journalist of sorts, is currently living with him, and we learn that there is a certain amount of attraction between Hugh and Yvonne.  Also residing in town are Firmin's childhood friend Jacques Laruelle, a film director, and the solicitous Dr. Vigil, who try to help Firmin stabilize his life.<br />The novel's heavy use of symbolism turns this seemingly ordinary day into a kaleidoscopic series of sights, sounds, and images.  Firmin, Yvonne, and Hugh's activities throughout the day are narrated as though building to an ominous crescendo of fate: the decor in Laruelle's house, the Peter Lorre movie, the upside-down ride on the \\"Infernal Machine\\" at the festival, the dying Indian on the side of the road, the rodeo -- everything seems to be a signpost guiding Firmin, whois too far past the redemption offered by the angelic Yvonne, to his ugly ultimate destiny.<br />Although to an extent the novel reflects Lowry's disillusionment with Mexico's European-influenced political climate, he has an obvious love of the scenery and the native cultures; Quauhnahuac is described so beautifully and vividly, it's practically a character in itself -- a living, vital part of the story.  Using some stream-of-consciousness narration, shifting focus, and internal monlogues, the novel's style is almost impressionistic and adds to its complexity, making it a work of unusual distinction and affirming Lowry as an absolutely stunning writer.	2002-03-11
US	49396726	R1P4P7PVOF49RT	0449912108	449727815	The Witches of Eastwick	Books	5	52	58	N	N	Updike gives witchery a whirl.	John Updike astutely recognizes the modern American suburb, with its hypocritical social mores and superstitions, as a rich literary setting. Into this milieu he introduces the fantastical and invents a tale of what life would be like for three divorced and bored housewives, who happen to be witches, living in such a place -- the fictitious Eastwick, Rhode Island -- in the late 1960's. It's like Updike is channeling Nathaniel Hawthorne through \\"Rabbit Redux.\\"<br />The women are Alexandra Spofford, a sculptress, Jane Smart, a cellist, and Sukie Rougemont, the local gossip columnist. They drink a lot, neglect their kids, have sex with married men, and cast spells to torment their enemies, who are usually their lovers' wives; they have the traditional witchlike manners of being vindictive, temperamental, and spiteful. They've never desired a man in common until they meet a vaguely devilish fellow named Darryl Van Horne who has bought an old mansion on the outskirts of town. Van Horne is quite mysterious: He's a Manhattanite, a pianist, a collector of tacky nouveau art, and a renegade scientist, trying to discover impossibly efficient methods of generating electricity. He takes an interest in Alexandra's crude little sculptures, accompanies Jane in some sonatas, and encourages Sukie to write novels. He invites them to play tennis (where their magic lends itself to some creative cheating) and partake of the orgiastic pleasures of his hot tub. <br />The witches' auras induce strange and tragic effects on the lives of their lovers. Ed Parsley, the Unitarian minister, runs off to join the anti-war movement, leaving his churlish wife Brenda to take over the pulpit. Clyde Gabriel, the editor of Sukie's newspaper, is stuck with a gabby wife who gets her satisfaction from finding fault with everything. But it's the Gabriels' adult daughter Jenny that serves to drive a wedge between the witches and Van Horne. When Jenny shows up in town from Chicago, Sukie takes pity on the seemingly pathetic girl and invites her to join the \\"coven\\" at Van Horne's mansion. Jenny attracts Van Horne's amorous attentions, but his intentions, it turns out, confound even the witches' intuition. <br />Popular culture has interpreted the witch mystique as a form of feminine self-empowerment -- women willing themselves to be able to act in retribution or defense against men's hurtful actions -- so it makes sense that the witches in the novel imply that witchcraft is an untapped power all women have, particularly those who have been hurt by or are unhappy with the men in their lives. And it makes sense for Updike to have set the novel in the era of the Women's Movement of the 1960's, where witchcraft would have shed a new, different light on liberation. Are the witches of Eastwick liberated? Probably so, but it's too bad they're so miserable nonetheless.	2002-03-05

Specifically, it is concerned with her arrival at a certain state of self-awareness and self-reliance as a result of her relationships with her three husbands.  <br />The protagonist, Janie Crawford, was raised by her grandmother, whose memories of slavery and poverty inspire her principal desire for her granddaughter to marry well and become a respectable lady.  She compels Janie to marry a dull and much older man named Logan Killicks.  Salvation is close at hand, however; one day Janie meets an attractive young man named Jody Starks and soon runs away with him to get married, despite not having divorced Killicks.  <br />Jody is ambitious and motivated; he wants to be a \\"big voice.\\"  He takes Janie to a new, ungoverned \\"black\\" town called Eatonville, quickly takes charge of building and improving it, and becomes the mayor almost by default.  He runs the store and post office and forces Janie to work for him, constantly treating her with condescension, humiliation, and possessiveness, for which she occasionally retaliates in kind.  He assumes that her status as the mayor's wife is sufficient to keep her happy, when what she really wants is her own voice and not to have to live in his shadow all the time.  When he eventually dies of kidney failure, she rejoices in her emancipation rather than mourns.<br />Soon Janie meets Tea Cake, who is quite a bit younger than her and more easygoing, fun-loving, and reckless than Jody.  They get married and move to a farming village down in the Everglades, where Janie gets the opportunity to socialize more openly with the common folks than she did when she was Mrs. Starks.  Janie and Tea Cake's marriage ends in a very ironic way that I will not reveal, but it is this climactic event which transforms Janie into the woman we presume she will be for the rest of her life.   <br />Race relations between whites and blacks are not a major focus of this novel.  There is acknowledgement of the effects of segregation in the complexion-obsessed Mrs. Turner, who thinks the black race should be \\"lightened\\" so as to be more acceptable to white people; and after the harrowing hurricane scene, it is revealed that white corpses take precedence over black corpses in the receipt of coffins.  For the most part, however, the novel is concerned with the everyday relationships among its black characters and the slang and pronunciational nuances that characterize their interaction.<br />At the time of its publication, this novel was criticized by some black writers for not being sufficiently angry or socially or politically active, but it doesn't need to be.  It is a bold, assertive novel about a woman who learns to affirm her sense of self-worth, and that is as sufficient a statement as can be expected of literature.	2002-03-01

Part intense character study, part Dixiedrama, part crime story, part commentary on race relations, it drives itself forward with inexorable energy, never stopping to let the reader catch his breath.  It thrives on restlessness, desperation, confusion:  One man, named Joe Christmas, has spent his whole life trying to escape his identity; another, named Lucas Burch, is trying to escape responsibility.  It all culminates in what turns out to be one unforgettable August in Jefferson, Mississippi.<br />Lucas has gotten his girlfriend Lena Grove pregnant back in Alabama; he moves to Jefferson and gets a job at a planing mill, intending never to see her again.  However, Lena manages to track him to Jefferson and arrives in town just in time to see the rising smoke from a burning house.<br />The house belongs to Miss Burden, a charitable spinster who had let Joe Christmas live in a cabin on her land.  Christmas used to work with Lucas at the mill, but the two of them went into bootlegging and roomed together in the cabin.  When it is discovered that Miss Burden was murdered before the fire broke out, Lucas accuses Christmas of the crime, hoping to collect a generous reward offered by Miss Burden's nephew.<br />Most of the novel is concerned with the events in Christmas's life that brought him to this predicament.  Christmas, the offspring of an interracial relationship, has known nothing but rejection and ostracism since his birth.  He was raised in an orphanage before being adopted by a strict religious couple; as a young adult he became a vagrant, drifting from town to town doing menial jobs, getting into trouble, always with a sullen chip on his shoulder, nursing enmity for the whites who consider him a \\"negro\\" when he reveals his ancestry.<br />Too dense to understand that Lucas doesn't want any part of her or the baby, Lena is willing to follow or search for him anywhere, accepting any help she can get from strangers.  One of these strangers is another mill worker named Byron Bunch who falls in love with her.  Byron has a friend named Reverend Hightower, a former Presbyterian minister who was evicted from his church because of suspected insanity.  Byron wants to help Lena and consults Hightower about the right course of action, but his solicitousness is misdirected; he's like Faulkner's Mississippi manifestation of Don Quixote.  Hightower, in turn, tries to be Byron's moral compass, but his own needle has gone haywire in its frantic search for magnetic North.<br />\\"Light in August\\" features a more straightforward narration as opposed to the experimental prose styles that characterized \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and \\"As I Lay Dying.\\"  However, there are still some colorful narrative techniques, such as information delivered through monologues by minor characters outside of the main plot.  The characters are so lively and the story is so absorbing that the obvious statement about bigotry -- how white people attribute the crimes of Christmas, who is outwardly a white man, to his \\"negro blood\\" -- seems almost standard issue.  But the history of the old South provides so many facts with which Faulkner can support his point that he doesn't have to exaggerate the irony.	2002-02-26

His parents tried to dissuade him -- it was a dangerous occupation, and certainly a middle class child like him could find a calling much safer and more comfortable.  Naturally, he didn't listen, and essentially ran away from home, finding opportunities to sail on a few ships and encountering a few dangers until he finally reached Brazil, bought a plantation, and looked forward to that comfortable life of prosperity his parents said would be his if he'd only use his head.<br />But Crusoe is one to push fate.  He embarks on a ship bound for Africa to collect slaves, and during a storm in the Caribbean Sea, the ship is wrecked and the crew drowned except for Crusoe, who manages to swim to the shore of a deserted island.  Unable to get back to civilization, he salvages as many goods as he can from the wrecked ship and resolves to survive as long as possible in this new, unwelcome habitat. <br />Crusoe's resourcefulness is astounding.  He builds a sophisticated hut/tent/cave complex to live in, hunts goats and fowl, harvests fruit, and figures out how to grow barley, rice, and corn, bake bread, and make earthenware vessels.  After living this way for nearly two peaceful decades, Crusoe discovers that savages from a distant island are using his island for their cannibal feasts.  He manages to save the life of one of their potential victims, a savage he names Friday, who becomes his faithful servant.  With Friday's help, Crusoe realizes he now has a chance to escape the island once and for all and get back to civilization, although his plans don't proceed quite as he envisioned them.   <br />\\"Robinson Crusoe\\" is a neatly woven adventure yarn, but under the surface there are several themes.  The most apparent is that the novel seems like a morality tale -- i.e., hard work and faith in God will see you through bad times; virtue is rewarded and arrogance is punished.  Another theme is that although nature can be a cruel foe, man is better off learning to work in harmony with it than struggling against it.  Most interesting to me, though, is that reading about Crusoe's self-education in the art of survival is like witnessing the anthropological process of how civilization developed from savagery.	2002-02-20

The title character, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, has been a prisoner there for the past eight years and has two more to go, provided his sentence isn't extended even longer for no reason at all.  As a Soviet soldier in World War II, he was imprisoned after being accused of spying for the Germans, but the novel is concerned more with his daily routine at the camp than with the politics behind his imprisonment.<br />Like anybody who's been in a highly structured and disciplined environment for a long time, Shukhov has developed his own individualized way of living day to day, bending the rules, avoiding punishment, and making life a little more bearable under the circumstances.  Temperatures are commonly well below zero and the food is barely nutritional enough to keep the prisoners alive, but Shukhov has adapted well enough to know how to stay warm and make the most out of his meals.  On this particular day, Shukhov's squad is forced to work construction; the novel describes how well Shukhov has honed his masonry skills as he expertly lays blocks and mortar building a wall for a building that will be used to hold future prisoners.  Life at the camp has made him tough and independent; his only weakness is tobacco, for which he will beg, borrow, or steal.<br />The novel is based on Solzhenitsyn's own experience as a labor camp prisoner under Stalin's reign, and therefore it has a sincere, natural, brutal quality that not even someone like Orwell could imitate.  More than anything, though, it portrays a man whose spirit is strong enough to triumph over the most extreme adversity.  Case in point: There is another prisoner named Fetiukov, a sniveling weasel who cries about his harsh treatment.  Shukhov observes that Fetuikov won't survive his imprisonment because he has the wrong attitude, which is why he can't help butfeel a little sorry for the guy.  This work is not only an indictment of the machinations of one of the twentieth century's most oppressive political systems; it also succeeds as a concise study in humanism.	2002-02-19

It confronts a difficult theme -- the disintegration of a once-noble British family by two world wars and changes in the social and moral fabric of the first half of the twentieth century.  But Waugh handles the material with the aplomb of a natural storyteller and the objectivity of an observer who is wise enough never to become too symphathetic with his characters.<br />\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is narrated in flashback through the voice of a British Army captain named Charles Ryder, who one day in 1943 inadvertently finds himself near an estate called Brideshead which he recognizes as a place he'd first seen twenty years before.  His memories take us directly back to 1923 when he was a freshman at Oxford and befriended a fellow student named Lord Sebastian Flyte.  Sebastian is pampered, effeminate, and abnormally juvenile; he spends more time drinking than studying and owns a teddy bear.  Now, I realize that it's not absurd for a grown man to own a teddy bear, but it is when he frequently refers to the bear by its christened name, treats it as a confidant, and brings it with him on outings.  With Sebastian, Charles finds himself moving in a new social circle, illuminated by the even more flamboyantly effeminate and sexually ambiguous Anthony Blanche.   <br />Sebastian is secretive about his family but nevertheless takes Charles to visit the family house at Brideshead.  Eventually Charles does get to meet Sebastian's sisters Julia and Cordelia, his older brother the Earl of Brideshead, and his (separated) parents, Lord and Lady Marchmain.  It's apparent that Sebastian dislikes his family, especially his pious Catholic mother; his excessive drinking is a means to escape his unhappiness.  Charles, meanwhile, sort of adopts this family as his own and becomes intimately involved in their affairs; his own father -- his only close living relative -- is somewhat of a doddering old fool and not much good company.<br />Over the following years, the characters grow and develop as all good characters should.  Julia marries a budding politician named Rex Mottram, who makes a comically clumsy attempt at conversion to Catholicism before the wedding; Charles becomes an artist and starts an affair with Julia during a stormy Atlantic crossing; the Earl collects matchboxes; Cordelia, the most conscientious of the Flytes, becomes a humanitarian aid worker.  Sebastian, who is so central early in the novel, gradually falls out of the picture; years of idleness, apathy, irresponsibility, and debauchery lead him to a miserable existence in northern Africa.<br />There is significance in Charles's chosen profession -- that of an artist who paints architectural portraits of ancient English manors -- because it parallels his role as historian and chronicler of the decadent Flyte family; he gives the impression of a curator proudly showing a portrait of a stately old house or family and saying, \\"This was once a great monument of England.\\"  \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is not an outright funny novel like \\"Scoop\\" (although there is an amusing cross-reference to the Beast, the newspaper from \\"Scoop\\"), but it is still filled with Waugh's wry charm and his effortlessly mellifluous prose.	2002-02-15

But it also showcases the life and times of one of the meanest men ever to hit the stage: Richard, Duke of Gloucester, unlawful heir to the throne of England.<br />Richard's outward appearance is unfortunate -- he has a crooked back, is unlucky in love, and dogs bark at him -- but it's his inward personality that makes him unpleasant.  He's cruel, selfish, manipulative, hot-tempered -- for dramatic purposes, he makes the perfect villain.  Nobody seems to like him except his cronies Catesby and Buckingham, and even Buckingham later turns against him; even his own mother despises him after she figures out what a rat he is.  On the other hand, he has all the positive qualities of a fighting underdog:  Rather than wallow in self-pity over his deformity, he's decisive, fearless, and motivated.  Only in the last act, when he realizes that he does indeed have a \\"coward conscience,\\" does his confidence begin to falter.<br />Richard tells the audience in the very first scene what kind of guy he is and what he's planning to do, which is ultimately to become King of England, the office held currently by his brother Edward IV.  To do this, he must arrange for the deaths of his brother George the Duke of Clarence, King Edward's sons, the Lord Chamberlain, and Buckingham, done by simply dispatching his henchmen.  All the while, he is continually informing the audience of his next vicious scheme, winking at us with a you-know-you-love-me-anyway impudence as though we were accomplices in his dirty deeds.<br />What makes Richard the perfect dramatic villain, though, is not just his wickedness, but the underhanded ways he deflects censure from the people he most wishes to impress.  Watch how he plays the innocent lamb to Lady Anne, whose husband and father-in-law he murdered and whom he is trying to marry; how he rationalizes his evil deeds to Queen Elizabeth, whose sons he ordered killed and whose daughter he would like to marry after Anne dies; how he feigns piety and modesty to appear to the English people all the more deserving of the crown.  I think this is the mark of Shakespeare's genius -- creating not just a bad guy, but a guy who's so bad he knows exactly how and when to pretend to be good.ts censure from the people he most wishes to impress.

Covering the time leading up to the war, \\"The Magic Mountain\\" personifies this transformation in its main character, a young man named Hans Castorp, whose life becomes immeasurably enriched after he abandons the ease and complacency of his childhood and opens his mind to new vistas of knowledge.  It is not just the coming-of-age novel of a man, but of the world.  <br />Hans is a moderately intelligent engineering student from Hamburg who grew up in an environment of comfort and leisure with not many thoughts about anything other than what concerns him directly.  One summer, he goes to the Swiss Alps for three weeks to visit his cousin Joachim Ziemssen, who is convalescing at a sanatorium called Berghof for people with respiratory ailments.  While there, Hans takes ill as well and is forced to stay longer to recuperate, a stay which stretches itself out to seven years.  <br />At the Berghof, Hans makes the acquaintance of several other patients of various intellectual and social levels.  Most prominent is an Italian named Settembrini, a freelance writer, cynic, and progressivist who dreams of a world republic and believes literature is the ultimate unification of politics and humanism.  His current work in focus is the contribution of a literature section to an encyclopedia on human suffering, the intent of which is to catalog all its causes and try to eliminate them.  Settembrini has a nemesis in another off-site patient named Leo Naphta, a Jew-turned-Jesuit who advocates a sort of Christian communism, using St. Augustine's City of God as a model.  These two have ongoing philosophical and theological debates, the effect of which is a battle for Hans's soul.   <br />Hans gradually broadens his interests, indulging himself in biology, anatomy, botany, skiing, music, and the exploration of the ultimate scientific mystery, how life grew out of unlife.  Other patients also occupy his time: Clavdia Chauchat, a married woman whose husband never enters the picture and who is the object of many affections at the Berghof; the malapropism-speaking Frau Stohr; Paravant, a mathematician who is trying to determine if pi is a rational number; Mynheer Peeperkorn, a wealthy Dutch epicure; and Ellen Brand, a girl with paranormal experiences. <br />Along with Jorge Luis Borges, Mann is arguably the most erudite writer of 20th Century fiction.  I was consistently amazed at the depth and detail with which he could write about such a wide variety of subjects, from the sciences to the arts to politics.  The novel expects its reader to be highly and thoroughly educated, but don't sweat the tough stuff; you can approach unfamiliar territory with the wide-eyed wonder of Hans and imbibe the ideas presented as food for thought and discussion.	2002-02-07

On the surface, \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" appears to be a cold, clinical, obscure science fiction novel, but on further inspection it turns out to be an endearing story about diplomacy, friendship, understanding, and cooperation.  If, as Le Guin states in the introduction, all fiction is metaphor, then this novel could be a model of the potential for world harmony.<br />A man named Genly Ai, for all intents and purposes an Earthling like us, is sent by a sort of interplanetary art and commerce forum called the Ekumen as an envoy to the isolated wintry planet Gethen to convince the Gethenians to join the other planets in open trade and communication.  The first nation he visits, Karhide, responds to his request with skepticism and hostility, and he doesn't fare much better in the neighboring Orgoreyn, where he is arrested and sent to a prison labor camp.<br />The Gethenians are human, but they have one unique remarkable attribute: they are androgynous, \\"hermaphroditic neuters,\\" and each one is able to exhibit either male or female sexual characteristics for the purpose of reproduction.  This allows them a society that is free from traditional gender roles, so they have no concept of masculinity or femininity.  Their civilization seems somewhat primitive compared to those of other worlds; one is unsure whether their physiology is a result of evolution or de-evolution.<br />Genly's closest Gethenian ally is a man named Estraven, the exiled ex-prime minister of Karhide who escapes to Orgoreyn hopefully to help Genly on his mission to convince the government to link with the Ekumen.  The best section of the book is the description of Genly and Estraven's difficult journey through hundreds of miles of barren tundra, where the term \\"male bonding\\" takes on strange new dimensions due to Estraven's physiological peculiarities.<br />I loved the icy imagery of the weather, the cities, and the landscapes, the depth of the Gethenian philosophies and the richness of their culture, and the tightness of the plot, which achieves a satisfying closure.  This is an excellent work of science fiction that delights in pure storytelling rather than making the reader slog through a morass of technical details.	2002-01-28

Ultimately, it is about a civil war between professional soldiers and a ragtag bunch of rebels, with unforeseeably tragic consequences for both sides.<br />There are three basic political factions involved:  The Progressivist Republican Party, who are headed by a newspaper owner named Epaminondas Goncalves, are upholding the new Republican government which has recently replaced the old Empire.  The Autonomist Party, who are made up of wealthy landowners and former slaveowners and are represented by the Baron de Canabrava, lament the loss of their prosperity under the auspices of the Empire.  Lastly, but most importantly, a group called the jaguncos (rebels), a sect of Catholic fundamentalists who are led by a priest called the Counselor, are protesting the new Republic because they feel the changes it has effected have undermined the Catholic Church, particularly by separating the powers of Church and State.  <br />The jaguncos, who essentially worship the Counselor with a dangerously fanatical zeal, have gathered together in a city called Canudos which they have turned into a religious stronghold.  Canudos attracts the most wretched people from the surrounding areas -- murderers, bandits, the poor, the diseased, the malformed, all seeking redemption from the Counselor, who preaches to them that the new Republic is evil, the Antichrist, and implores them to forsake its laws and currency.<br />The Republican government feels threatened by the rebels of Canudos -- it's not just an isolated pocket of discontent; it's a large community that is continuously expanding its borders.  The Bahia militia launches a number of missions to crush the jaguncos, who prove to be highly resistant because they're organized well and fight ferociously, with no other thought than to protect the Counselor.  Meanwhile, the Republicans think the Autonomists are in collusion with the British crown in a worldwide effort to preserve monarchism and are secretly aiding the jaguncos in their fight against the Republic. <br />A few specific characters are central to the perspective on the conflict.  In addition to the principal figures already mentioned, there is a local Scotsman who calls himself Galileo Gall, a sort of proto-Communist who hates religion and government and seeks to uplift the oppressed masses.  Considering them kindred souls, he is interested in the jaguncos of Canudos and involves himself in a deadly scheme to supply them with arms.  There is an unnamed journalist, identified only by his nearsightedness, who accompanies the Republican army on their mission to quell the rebels and ends up helpless in Canudos.  The characterization of the jaguncos is excellent as well, describing not only their present state of mind but the events in their respective pasts that brought them under the Counselor's spell.<br />Like Hemingway, Vargas Llosa illustrates scenes of battles and the wounded and dying with amazingly intricate detail and forceful passion, taken to utterly horrifying and sickening extremes.  Such writing does make a point about how far a government is willing to go to keep its people \\"in line,\\" and the extent to which some rebels are willing to sacrifice themselves to stand up for what they believe, because for them, the end of the world really is at stake.	2002-01-25

It takes tremendous liberties with history by joyfully slandering such revered icons as Isaac Newton and Pocahontas and concocting a ridiculous plot filled with incredible coincidences that would make Charles Dickens's head spin, but that's what makes it so much fun. <br />The main character, Ebenezer Cooke, is an affluent, idle young Englishman whose only professional aspiration is to be a poet while trying to preserve his virginity for the purity of his art.  Through a series of misfortunes, he is assigned to go to America to oversee his father's Maryland tobacco plantation, Malden, but he also manages to be appointed Poet and Laureate of Maryland after getting an interview with Lord Baltimore.  Idealistic and naive, he embarks on his journey expecting everything to turn out great.<br />As expected in a novel like this, everything does not turn out great.  Danger lurks around every corner, requiring Ebenezer to enlist the aid of companions who are often more troublesome than helpful.  Accompanying him at various times are his resourceful and sly valet Bertrand and his childhood tutor Henry Burlingame, who turns out to be a man of many identities and a master of disguise.  Burlingame, orphaned young, is determined to trace his mysterious ancestry, and his search becomes an integral part of the plot.<br />Ebenezer's journey to Maryland is fraught with picaresque adventures.  He is pursued by agents of the archvillain John Coode, kidnapped by pirates, marooned, and captured by Indians.  All of these events are part of the political intrigue concerned with whether Maryland is to be predominantly a Catholic or Protestant province, and whether Englishmen will even be able to live there without worrying about being murdered by angry dispossessed Indians.  When Ebenezer gets to Maryland, he is surprised to find it a bastion of prostitution, venality, and corruption, and through circumstances beyond his control or will, Malden turns into a brothel, opium den, and gambling house -- an appropriately comic predicament which Ebenezer and his friends must rectify using all the resources at their disposal.<br />After reading this book, I felt like I had been clubbed over the head and taken on a wild ride through somebody's demented idea of a 17th-Century amusement park.  It is intended to be a parody, but Barth, who is a native of the area he writes about, obviously invested a great amount of scholarship and research in its preparation.  This is a novel for not only lovers of fiction, but anyone with an interest in Chesapeake Bay geography or colonial American history -- and a sense of humor.	2002-01-21

These are the kind of people where if you were their neighbor, even if you knew what was going on, you couldn't be bothered to call the police and would just turn up the TV volume to drown out the sound of the screaming.<br />The title character is Fred Clegg, a quiet, unsociable clerk who has recently come into a lot of money by winning a betting pool.  He collects butterflies as a hobby, but his obsession is a young art student named Miranda Grey.  He kidnaps her, locks her in the cellar of his house, and keeps her like a pet.  He does not have a romantic, sexual, or animalistic attraction to her; he just wants to possess her like a specimen.<br />Fred allows Miranda all the comforts of home except communication with the outside, and she gradually adapts to her new environment, although she never abandons plans for escape.  They are usually civil to each other, but occasionally violence does erupt.  She keeps a diary in which we get to see her side of things, but since she doesn't offer much more insight into her state of captivity than Fred does, it's almost like reading the same account of the events twice.  By the end of the novel, I couldn't sympathize with her; it's a bad sign when you hope a character dies just so she'll shut up.<br />Fowles narrates in the first person, alternating between the voices of both Fred and Miranda.  Fred's insipid, inarticulate narration -- revealing his simplicity and lack of education -- got on my nerves after so much of it, and even Miranda's more intelligent narration wore thin with her increasing despair, self-absorption, and shallow thoughts about her unsteady relationship with a much older man, an artist she calls G.P.  I realize that Fowles's intention was to keep them in character, but first-person narration is effective only with interesting personalities, which Fred and Miranda lack (and which Nicholas Urfe in &quot;The Magus&quot; has in spades).  It might have been better written in third person, allowing a more intelligent and descriptive perspective.<br />I greatly admired Fowles's &quot;The Magus.&quot;  It was exciting, intriguing, mysterious, beautifully written, epic in scope, everything a novel should be.  &quot;The Collector,&quot; on the other hand, gives the impression of having been written in a hurry and with not much care as to its outcome or impact.  I'm disappointed because it had the potential to be so much more.  It could have been a 20th Century update of the Hades and Persephone story, or Fred could have been an English Raskolnikov.  As it is, it might be an allegory on the state of marriage or a satire on the new philistine English middle class (the &quot;New People,&quot; as Miranda calls them), but it goes nowhere with these ideas, preferring to remain an empty, stale fable.ck (and which Nicholas Urfe in &quot;The Magus&quot; has in spades).

US	49396726	R3DHO6JBWHLR0F	0140440178	483358679	Old Goriot (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	17	19	N	N	An exemplary tragicomedy	Balzac's &quot;Old Goriot&quot; both celebrates and satirizes early 19th Century Parisian society and its idiosyncrasies.  In terms of the variety of characters it introduces and the themes covered, it is a novel of incredibly wide scope, written with efficiency and some of the most beautiful prose, at least via Marion Crawford's English translation.<br />Goriot is an elderly gentleman living in a Paris boardinghouse in 1819.  He used to be a prosperous vermicelli merchant, but hard times of late have forced him to pawn off his remaining precious possessions and move into the cheapest room available in the house.  Since running afoul of the landlady Madame Vauquer, whose romantic attentions he once spurned, he has become an object of ridicule to the other boarders, due to his shabby clothes and apparent senility.<br />Most of the novel's action, however, centers around another of the boarders, a law student named Eugene de Rastignac who comes from a modest family.  Rastignac's situation and motives are easy for any urban young man to identify with: He is eager to climb into the upper echelons of Paris society, but he finds to his dismay that the fashionable Parisian women are not interested in paupers.  His wealthy cousin, Madame de Beauseant, advises him that he must be ruthless to make it in high society.  With his cousin's help, Rastignac acquaints himself with two young society matrons, Anastasie, the Countess de Restaud, and Delphine, the Baroness de Nucingen, who happen to be Goriot's daughters.<BR>  <BR>Goriot's relationship to his daughters provides the basis for the novel.  He spoiled them rotten as little girls; consequently, they grew up irresponsible, greedy, and ungrateful.  Having married wealthy men, they both seek consolation from their unhappy marriages through reckless spending and extramarital beaus.  Despite their faults, Goriot loves and cares for his daughters with something more like a neurotic obsession than warm, paternal devotion.  You can't help feel sorry for the guy, suffering from his delusions, selling everything he owns, and living in squalor so that his daughters, who are unable or unwilling to fend for themselves or fight their own battles, can stay financially solvent.<BR> <BR>There is an interesting subplot involving another boarder at Madame Vauquer's house, a devilish, unscrupulous fellow named Vautrin who may not be what he initially appears to be.  Vautrin knows Rastignac is trying to get his foot in the door of Parisian society and he knows he needs money to do it.  He proposes this scheme: Rastignac will marry a poor girl dwelling at the boardinghouse named Victorine; Vautrin will have Victorine's brother killed so that she'll inherit the whole of her father's fortune, which will bring Rastignac into big money and high society, and he can pay Vautrin for collusion.  The way Balzac plays out this scenario without letting it become an interference with the main story line of Rastignac's relationship to Goriot's daughters is quite a deft feat of plotting.	2002-01-07

Salinger's short fiction, as these &quot;Nine Stories&quot; show, is squarely in the New Yorker style, providing snapshots of the comfortable postwar lives of smart urban people, but there is a mark of strange distinction here.  These stories merge the realistic and the bizarre so effortlessly and naturally, they make human experience seem more interesting and special than we usually perceive it to be.  These are stories to be read, and reread, and reread for the fun of plunging into their mysterious depths and coming up with whatever pearls may have appeared since the last time they were read.<br />Each story is unique, complex, and perplexing.  It would be difficult for me to pick a favorite, but the one that intrigues me the most is &quot;Just Before the War with the Eskimos.&quot;  It has an ending that is so inscrutable, describing it would be futile -- but I'll just say it involves the relationship between a discarded chicken sandwich and a dead Easter chick.  It's like holding a locked box in your hands, the key nowhere to be found, wondering what could possibly be inside.<br /><br />The characters have secrets that are barely, if at all, revealed to the reader, who is forced to look for clues in the text.  We read about a man with a lost soul and an oblivious wife (&quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot;), two college pals who drunkenly reminisce about old times (&quot;Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut&quot;), and a ten-year-old genius who has little use for emotions (&quot;Teddy&quot;).  There is a story within a story, where the &quot;inner&quot; story is affected by the events of the &quot;outer&quot; story (&quot;The Laughing Man&quot;), a story about a man's motivation to write a story (&quot;For Esme -- With Love and Squalor&quot;), and a telephone conversation between two men about a woman (&quot;Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes&quot;).<br />The stories can be appreciated for their surface beauty as well.  The interaction between the characters creates palpable tension, the dialogue is sharp and vivid, there is hardly a wasted word; and so, if indeed it is impossible to fathom the full mysterious depths of each story, then, as the protagonist of &quot;De Daumier-Smith's Blue Period&quot; says, I am willing to stay in the dark.palpable tension, the dialogue is sharp and vivid, there is hardly a wasted word; and so, if indeed it is impossible to fathom the full mysterious depths of each story, then, as the protagonist of &quot;De Daumier-Smith's Blue Period&quot; says, I am willing to stay in the dark.	2002-01-03

The novel takes place in the Ukraine in 1911.  The protagonist is a Jewish man named Yakov Bok who, abandoned by his wife and unable to find lucrative work as a handyman, leaves his native shtetl (village) and moves to Kiev, immediately encountering the virulent anti-Semitism rampant among many of the resident Christians.  <br />One day Yakov helps a man named Lebedev and his crippled daughter.  Recognizing Lebedev as a member of a notorious anti-Semitic organization called the Black Hundreds, Yakov assumes a Christian surname.  Lebedev is grateful enough to Yakov to give him a job painting and wallpapering some rooms in his house, and is so impressed with his work that he offers him a bookkeeping position at his brickmaking factory.  Even though it's not his line of work, Yakov reluctantly takes the job because he really needs the money.<br />During the following Passover, a dead Christian boy is found in a nearby cave, his body stabbed dozens of times and his blood drained almost methodically.  The police declare this a Jewish ritual murder, and Yakov, now identified as a Jew, is arrested, even though there is no physical evidence implicating him as the murderer.  The testimony against him, fueled by the anti-Semitic sentiments of the brickyard workers and a Russian Orthodox priest, is overwhelming and mostly irrelevant or false.  Yakov's insistence that he is not religious and is a &quot;freethinker&quot; falls on deaf ears.  Incarcerated while waiting for trial, he is subjected to all forms of duress, humiliation, and misery.  <br />This is a dark, nightmarish, gloomy novel, filled with disturbing images of mortality, poverty, and hopelessness.  Its impact is similar to that of the best dystopian novels -- &quot;1984,&quot; &quot;Brave New World,&quot; &quot;Darkness at Noon,&quot; &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; -- in the way it portrays a man in conflict with a society that seeks to oppress and punish him.  It is not so much a diatribe against anti-Semitism as it is an examination of how prejudice, hatred, and ignorance obstruct justice, undermine society, and devalue man's existence.	2002-01-02

While Tom Sawyer tricks his friends into doing his chores for him and Huck Finn sails against the tides of 19th Century American bigotry, Hank Morgan, the hero of &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,&quot; rallies against feudalism, idle aristocracy, and a Unified Church.<br />Hank is a 19th Century Hartford blacksmith who receives a blow on the head and wakes up in 6th Century England.  He is taken to Camelot, King Arthur's court, and imprisoned, soon to be executed.  However, he manages to trick the court into thinking he's a magician by pretending to conjure an eclipse and blowing up the tower of Merlin, the resident court magician.  Thus proving his mettle, Hank is given a special post at the court and proceeds to introduce many 19th Century technologies, including firearms, explosives, newspapers, and a telephone network, continually upstaging Merlin in the department of wizardry.<br />While in Camelot, Hank has &quot;traditional&quot; adventures, too.  He accompanies a young wench named Alisande (&quot;Sandy&quot;) to rescue some princesses from a castle guarded by ogres (a joke with an excellent punchline) and meets Morgan Le Fay, Arthur's wicked sister, on the way.  Later, he and Arthur go undercover as peasants to get the lay of the land, which gives Hank opportunities to observe the ignorance of the common folk and the social injustices wrought by the combined tyranny of the church and the nobility.<br />Even if Twain's sense of humor isn't your cup of tea, it's hard to dismiss the urgency and conviction of his social commentary, which this novel does little if anything to disguise.  And Twain is smart enough to end the book with these capricious nuggets of irony:  Hank's efforts to separate church from state and replace the monarchy with a republic serve as much to destabilize the political climate as save the common folk from oppression, and his technological advancements serve as much to increase wartime killing capacity as raise the standard of living.  Civilization advances no faster than the weapons to destroy it.th a republic serve as much to destabilize the political climate as save the common folk from oppression, and his technological advancements serve as much to increase wartime killing capacity as raise the standard of living.

Naipaul's &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; is the story of the transformation of a Third World nation from old to new, a sort of rebirth.  It is narrated by an Indian man named Salim who grew up among many Indians, Arabs, and Europeans on the coast of an east African nation under European colonization.  When the nation gains its independence during a violent upheaval, Salim moves to the country's interior to a remote town on the bend of a major river where he buys a shop and establishes a business amidst the ruins of the old European civilization.<br />The town gradually grows, thrives, and modernizes due to the knowledge, skills, and initiative among the various residents.  One of Salim's friends, for example, is a fountain of entrepreneurial ideas and finally hits pay dirt with a fast-food franchise called Bigburger.  One of the European holdovers is a priest named Father Huismans who runs a school and loves Africa for the beauty of its native cultures.  Hotels, nightclubs, and a university spring up as a new multicultural civilization develops.<br />The nation's new president is known only as the Big Man.  He was an idealistic youth who had as a mentor a white European man named Raymond, a history professor who specializes in Africa.  The Big Man eventually decides to turn the increasingly corrupt nation into an African socialist regime, seizing the businesses of all the foreigners and turning them over to the natives; Salim, as a non-African African, is thus consigned to the fate of the dispossessed.  Like his wealthy Indian friend Indar, Salim finds out how easily a man can lose not just his home but his country.<br />Africa, although the second largest continent in area, has been the underdog of the world throughout history, ravaged for centuries by European invasion and intrusion to the point where all its European economic, political, and religious influences cannot simply be abandoned in its efforts to preserve its cultural heritage and traditions.  This novel is a fitting tribute to that theme.	2001-12-26

However, a great historical novel, like Gore Vidal's &quot;Lincoln,&quot; goes further and deeper into the motivations of its characters.  It turns history into drama and historical figures into human beings, people that the reader can care about not because they really existed, but because the printed page has miraculously brought them to life.  <br />&quot;Lincoln&quot; chronicles the turbulent last four years of the life of the sixteenth President of the United States.  It begins in February 1861 with Lincoln arriving in Washington to take office as the chief executive of a nation in turmoil: Southern states are seceding from the Union, exacerbated by the failure of a Democrat to be elected President.  Lincoln assembles a Cabinet that is quite divided on how to handle the imminent civil war: Secretary of State Seward has his eye on expanding the nation like an empire and thinks the secessionist states would rejoin the Union if Mexico (and eventually the entire Western hemisphere) were conquered; Secretary of the Treasury Chase is a staunch abolitionist who frets over how the war will be financed.  <br />Lincoln is more concerned with the preservation of the Union than the complete abolition of slavery; he draws up the Emancipation Proclamation which frees the slaves in the Confederate states as a military necessity but allows the border states to keep their slaves as an incentive not to join the Confederacy.  The war proceeds slowly and painfully as the blood of hundreds of thousands of soldiers stains the national landscape, while Lincoln struggles with imperfect generals commanding the Union army. <br />Lincoln's private life is also strewn with difficulty and heartbreak.  Two of his sons have died while his youngest, Tad, is an insufferable brat; his wife, Mary Todd, is a spendthrift and always on the verge of insanity.  Much of the novel is narrated from the perspective of Lincoln's personal secretary, John Hay, who observes the vicissitudes of White House intrigue with a sort of detached interest. <br />During the war, there is much espionage activity in Washington.  Vidal focuses on a young drugstore clerk named David Herold who relays messages for Confederate spies and hangs out with the Surratts, a family of devout Catholics who are loyal to the South.  Doing some side work as a theatrical stagehand, Herold meets a famous young actor named John Wilkes Booth who is also a Confederate symphathizer, even while he is making the rounds of fashionable Washington society.  After Lincoln is re-elected in 1864, Booth resolves once and for all to punish this man he considers a tyrant, and the rest, of course, is history. <br />Vidal's Lincoln is a complex man.  He is serious but calm and gentle, defuses the madness around him with a cynical sense of humor and a fondness for telling comical rustic anecdotes, and uses his pretenses as a mere timid country lawyer to disguise his ability to wield a dictatorial authority when pressed.  And since this is a novel and not a textbook, Vidal renders a Lincoln who can be appreciated as a literary character and not just as an American monument.	2001-12-20

It is a perspective on race relations in America in the 1930's -- how whites treat blacks and how blacks react -- and it rings true today louder than ever.  It is about black resentment against the white establishment, but it has emphathy for all its characters and presents several different points of view about the roles of victim and aggressor.<br />The protagonist is a 20-year-old black man named Bigger Thomas who lives with his mother, brother, and sister in an abject one-room apartment in Chicago's South Side.  He normally spends his days and nights stealing, shooting pool with his hoodlum friends, and hanging out with his girlfriend Bessie.  The novel begins on the day he is to start a new job as a chauffeur for the Dalton family, white millionaire philanthropists whose mischievous daughter, Mary, is a progressive liberal and a Communist sympathizer.  If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, the Daltons are working the jackhammer.  <br />The first night on the job, Mary instructs Bigger to drive her and her Communist boyfriend Jan around town while they get sloshed.  When they get home, Bigger feels obligated to take the drunken Mary up to her room and, to avoid being discovered in her room by her mother, accidentally smothers Mary with a pillow to keep her quiet.  To cover up this accident, which he is sure the white world will consider a case of a black man raping and murdering a white woman, he stuffs her body into the Daltons' furnace.<br />(...)<br />Bigger's predicament after the murder ironically gives him a certain freedom and control for the first time in his life.  He feels the white establishment has been oppressing and restraining him for so long that it was inevitable that one day he would seize a position of power with an incredible act of violence.  He knows that the whites will never understand the real reason he killed Mary, so there is no point in trying to convince them.  Because he feels that he's always been hated by white society, it fulfills a kind of persecution fantasy to listen to the angry shouts of white mobs looking to lynch him.  <br />A prevalent motif in the novel is the American paranoia towards Communism in the 1930's, which creates a striking parallel to Bigger's paranoia towards whites and also reflects Wright's interest in Communism at the time and his belief that it would provide racial equality.  That a novel filled with such angry, hateful characters, both black and white, could be written with such compassion and intelligence is indicative of a great writer, and the legacy of this novel maintains Wright as one of the great chroniclers of the history of American society.	2001-12-12

This is a rare gem of a novel that weaves mystery, adventure, intrigue, romanticism, and realism into a unique package that must have been way ahead of its time and still puts many modern &quot;suspense&quot; novels to shame with its superb prose and sheer elegance.<br />The novel takes place in a rural French village in the 1890's.  The narrator, Francois, is a young teenager who lives and studies at the village school, where his father is the headmaster.  One day a boy named Augustin Meaulnes, a couple of years older than Francois, enrolls as a new student and boarder.  Meaulnes is somewhat quiet and aloof, but he soon becomes popular with the other boys in the school.<br />One day Meaulnes expropriates a carriage to go to a nearby town on an errand and mysteriously disappears without explanation.  He returns to the school a few days later, but he admits that he doesn't know where he's been.  All he knows is that somehow he found himself in a strange, vague place -- a surreal, dreamlike realm that seemed to exist outside of the real world -- where he met a beautiful girl named Yvonne.  He pores over maps and searches for clues about this place -- the &quot;mysterious domain&quot; -- so that he can see Yvonne again, while Francois, fascinated by the story of his adventure, is determined to help him.<br />I would be doing a disservice to the potential reader by revealing any details of the nature of the &quot;mysterious domain&quot; or any more of the plot; so I will only say that every aspect of this novel is nothing short of brilliant, not only in its invention and unpredictability, but in the way it transforms itself by highlighting the contrast between the carefree dream-world of adolescence and the harsh realities of adulthood, and how our childish pastimes and fantasies inevitably give way to our sense of responsibility as we grow and mature.  In this manner, the plot actually &quot;matures&quot; with its characters, so that by the end, we see how &quot;grand&quot; a person Meaulnes really is.	2001-12-10

After years living in exile, Orestes returns to his hometown of Argos to avenge the murder of his father Agamemnon, the former king; in doing so and standing up to Zeus, he frees the townspeople from the enslavement of remorse, which is the tool of the gods.<br />In the almost noir-ish &quot;Dirty Hands,&quot; a young man named Hugo, a sheltered and pampered intellectual, joins a socialist radical political faction with the idea of helping his fellow man.  Unwilling to compromise his personal idealism, he finds that his comrades are willing to compromise it for him to serve the party's agenda.<br />And in &quot;The Respectful Prostitute,&quot; the title character is pressured to bear false witness in a criminal trial so that a racist murderer can escape justice.<br />The plays are expressionistic and maybe a little too obvious in making their points, but they are plotted and structured well and feature some very vividly drawn characters.  I'm not yet familiar with Sartre's work, but I felt this book was a good introduction.	2001-12-04
US	49396726	RH5LJTJP1D8JS	0553213113	551860371	Moby-Dick (Bantam Classics)	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Literature's Leviathan	Beginning with the narrator's famous humble request to be known only as Ishmael, and ending with his life being saved ironically by the buoyancy of an empty sealed coffin, &quot;Moby Dick&quot; introduces its reader to a world of monstrous proportions, both literally and figuratively.  Its subject is whaling, of course, but its theme is the much broader topic of man's motivation to do desperate and destructive things. <br />Ishmael is a seasoned sailor who decides to try whaling, so he goes to Nantucket Island with a companion, the noble savage Queequeg, to look for work on a suitable whaling ship.  They end up on the Pequod, which is captained by a badly scarred old salt named Ahab.  Ahab has one obsession: to find and kill Moby Dick, the legendary great white whale that bit off his leg in a vicious melee.  <br />The 135 chapters of this novel are divided between narrations of the Pequod's whaling voyages throughout the world and technical discussions of cetology.  Ishmael tells you everything you wanted or needed to know about whales and a lot more -- skin, bones, jaws, eyes, spout, tail; swimming, feeding, breathing, mating, nursing; the hunt, the harpooning, the towing, the uses of the whale carcass and its oil -- every conceivable aspect of whale culture is covered, until you start to feel that the book itself is somewhat of a whale.  However, these extensive lectures are necessary in order to lull the reader under the book's spell; Ahab's hunt for Moby Dick wouldn't mean anything unless you felt like you were part of the crew. <br />Ahab's fixation with the great white whale can only be described as monomaniacal, as Ishmael refers to him many times.  For much of the story, Ahab remains in the shadows, silently nursing his hatred and anger.  There is always a creepy foreshadowing of impending doom, that he will stop at nothing, not even the death of his crew and himself, to achieve his bloodthirsty goal.  The Pequod encounters several other whaling ships, and on each one he feverishly inquires of the captain whether Moby Dick has been spotted.  At the end, he finally does get the chance to meet his natatorial nemesis, and his fate is an example of what can happen when a man lets himself be consumed by his hatred. <br />&quot;Moby Dick&quot; is a classic because it has a haunting insularity -- it seems to exist alone in a world of its own creation, one that no other novel is able to penetrate, although many have tried.  Consider the originality of its characterization:  Its titular antagonist is a silent, elusive demon, and its protagonist (Ahab) is a bitter wretch, someone we don't ever want to be even though we all have felt his level of anger at some time.  In the world today, there are plenty of Ahabs chasing great white whales; those who are innocently trapped in the middle, like the crew of the Pequod, are often the ones who suffer the consequences.	2001-12-03
US	49396726	RYGA0S2U63IH1	0679729526	58983679	The Aeneid (Vintage Classics)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Great translation of an imperfect epic	Virgil's Aeneid is more than just an epic adventure; it's a declaration of its author's patriotic love for the Roman Empire.  Likewise, Aeneas is not just a literary hero, but a symbol of Rome's eventual fortitude and Virgil's vision of the progenitor of Augustus Caesar, the first Roman emperor.  Aeneas is the perfect heroic archetype: loyal to his family and his people, fierce and brutal to his enemies, and a stud with the ladies.  He is, in the minds of Virgil and probably all Roman men of the day, the ideal for the Roman man.<br />The background of the story:  The goddesses Juno, Venus, and Minerva are arguing over which of them is the most beautiful.  They decide to let a young man named Paris, a prince of Troy, judge them in a sort of beauty contest.  Each goddess offers Paris a bribe, but the one he accepts is Venus's, which is the promise of the love of Helen, queen of Sparta.  Paris and Helen run off together to Troy, which enrages her husband Menelaus and incites the Greeks to declare war on Troy.  After many years of fighting, the Greeks topple Troy and the few Trojan survivors, with Aeneas as their leader, set sail across the Mediterranean to search for a new home.  It is roughly here that the Aeneid begins. <br />It is prophesied that the Trojans will end up in Italy in the general area of what is now Rome, where Aeneas's descendants far into the future will build a Roman state of majesty and prosperity.  However, they have to endure many hardships along the way because Juno is still holding a grudge against them over the outcome of that beauty contest.  She besets them with a multitude of obstacles:  They're tossed around at sea by storms, attacked by harpies, and pursued by cyclopses.  (There are, of course, direct references to the Iliad and the Odyssey.)  Along the way, Aeneas is courted by Dido, the queen of Carthage, but he is impelled to leave her and continue his pilgrimage.  After a side trip to the underworld to visit his dead father, Aeneas and his cohorts finally arrive in Italy and make friends with the native people.  However, Juno sabotages this friendship and instigates a war between the Trojans and the Italians.  The remainder of the Aeneid chronicles this war with graphic descriptions of battles, ending with Aeneas's slaying of Turnus, his nemesis. <br />I found Fitzgerald's translation easy and enjoyable to read; the grammatical structure and choice of words are very &quot;modern&quot; while still maintaining the poem in its proper context.  Fitzgerald himself points out that the Aeneid is not perfect; it's incomplete and has some continuity errors.  But it is still a fascinating window on the hearts and minds of a civilization of antiquity.	2001-11-26

Like Dostoevsky's other novels, it is a study in man's motivations for good and evil, his potential for corruption, and his glory in salvation.  Each character, scene, and event in the novel seems to relay a principle that religion provides the structure for society, for better or worse.<br />The novel chronicles the fragmented Karamazov family, who live in a small Russian town.  The father, Fyodor, is a hedonistic, boorish landowner, twice a widower, who has his eye on a young lady named Grushenka.  He has four sons:  The oldest is Dmitri, an ex-military officer, a passionate, desperate, violent young man who is like his father in many ways; for one thing, he also is madly in love with Grushenka.  There is Dmitri's half-brother Ivan, intellectual and studious, but morbid and cynical, and whose motto is &quot;everything is lawful.&quot;  There is Ivan's gentle, magnanimous brother Alyosha who is an initiate monk and whom Ivan likes to provoke with his iconoclastic discourse.  Finally, there is the illegitimate Smerdyakov, a morose and cruel young man who works as Fyodor's cook.  None of the brothers has a particularly loving relationship with their father or with each other.<br />Each brother has a personal devil and an angel.  Dmitri's devil is Grushenka; his angel is a young lady named Katerina to whom he is engaged, both connubially and financially.  Alyosha's devil is a divinity student named Rakitin, who exploits the misfortunes of the Karamazovs; his angel is his mentor, Father Zossima, who represents religious solace.  Ivan's angel is his brother Alyosha; his devil is his own conscience, with whom he converses in one unforgettable chapter.  Smerdyakov's devil and angel are the same person: his father, the only person who has ever entrusted him.  It is interesting to observe how each brother's devil and angel influence his actions and thoughts and provide conflict throughout the novel.<br />One night, Fyodor is murdered, and Dmitri, who has the most urgent motive, is accused of the crime.  This could be considered the central event of the novel, but it is not the event on which the novel's profundity rests.  What is profound is the series of psychological mind games that the brothers play with each other both before and after the murder; they could be any trashy family on a modern TV talk show, but they have Shakespearean complexity and depth in the way they express their anguish and weave their webs of deceit.<br />The novel ends with a seemingly positive notion about death and the joy in the remnants of life; in the very last scene, the stirring speech that Alyosha delivers after a young friend's funeral could have been Dostoevsky's own requiem.  This is a staunchly uncompromising novel, refusing to provide any easy answers and forcing the reader to look inside his own heart for the source of good and evil.	2001-11-26

This is not intended to be a slight against Dickens, but rather a testament to the quality of Thomas Hardy's writing.<br />The first chapter alone is a dramatic masterpiece and perfectly sets the rhythm for the rest of the novel.  A young man named Michael Henchard and his wife Susan and baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane enter a village where Henchard hopes to find work as a hay-trusser.  They go to a country fair where Henchard immediately gets drunk and sells his wife and baby to a sailor.  Regretting his actions the next day, Henchard looks for them in vain, swears off liquor for twenty-one years, then takes up residence in a town called Casterbridge.<br />Nineteen years later, Susan, now widowed, and Elizabeth-Jane track Henchard to Casterbridge.  It turns out that in the intervening years, Henchard has become a successful granary owner and is now the town's mayor.  He welcomes his former wife and daughter, proving himself to be genial but often petty and easily vexed.  For one thing, he is in a bitter rivalry with a former employee, a young Scotchman named Donald Farfrae, not only in business but also for the affections of a vixenish woman named Lucetta who has recently moved to town.<br />Hardy wastes no pages unfolding the plot, which is filled with Dickensian intrigue.  It chronicles Henchard's relationship with Susan and Elizabeth-Jane after their return, his jealousy over Farfrae and Lucetta (who happens to be Henchard's old flame and inadvertently incites a public scandal because of this), his fear of the discovery of his deceit, and, finally, his feelings of isolation from Elizabeth-Jane and the town he loves.  By the end, you realize that Henchard is not a bad man; he's a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment.<br />Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid.  He has a sharp ear for native dialects, and the dialogue of Casterbridge's inhabitants comes off as genuinely homey chatter rather than just dispensations of information set up to advance the plot.  Moreover, like any good fictional place, Casterbridge takes on a vibrant life of its own, offering a realistic bucolic backdrop for this stormy human drama.'s a lonely man who's made the mistake of letting his love for Elizabeth-Jane distort his judgment. <br />Especially impressive is Hardy's prose, which is strong and descriptive without being florid.

There are heavy religious overtones to this novel, but they never feel preachy or compromise the strength of the drama. <br />The main character is Major Henry Scobie, the deputy-commissioner of police in a British-occupied West African state during World War II.  He's an honest cop on a force that is given to corruption:  Some officers routinely take bribes to overlook diamond-smuggling operations, many of which are masterminded by a sly Syrian named Yusef, who manipulates his friendship with the officers through favors and blackmail.  <br />Scobie's wife, Louise, is miserable; she is lonely and feels ostracized by the other officers' wives in the community.  She would like to leave and go to South Africa for a while, but Scobie can't leave his post to go with her or afford to send her because he's been passed over for promotion to commissioner.  His last resort to scrape together the money is to borrow it from Yusef, which puts him squarely under Yusef's thumb. <br />After Louise's departure, Scobie meets a girl named Helen whose husband drowned when their ship was attacked.  He falls in love with her despite the fact that she's young enough to be his daughter and mocks his piety.  He wonders if adultery can be a sin if the love is genuine, but this is not just a cynical attempt to rationalize his infidelity.  Adding to the conflict is a clerk named Wilson who is in love with Louise and, while he pretends to be Scobie's friend and moral compass, acts a sort of dual role as watchdog and betrayer.<br />Like the protagonist of Greene's &quot;The Power and the Glory,&quot; Scobie's character is defined by the fact that he is a devout Catholic who is contritely aware of his sins.  Although he believes that suicide would be eternal damnation, he poses a crucial question for himself:  Would it be better to kill himself for the sake of honor than to live shamefully, insulting God by kneeling before the altar while living adulterously?  <br />I see Scobie as a &quot;white knight&quot; type of character -- a cavalier, a protector, someone who was born to be a policeman, someone who is sworn to follow the moral code of Christianity.  When he fails in this task, or believes that he fails, he is forced to question the validity of continuing his mission; that is, his life.  After reading so many novels about people with moral uncertainties, I find a fresh perspective in this man who draws courage from his convictions and acts accordingly.	2001-11-12

Forster's &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is a romantic comedy, and as such, it follows the typical formula of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl.  This basic plot is, of course, embellished with a lot of comical characters, exotic settings, and convenient misunderstandings, but none of this mollifies my opinion that the novel, although well-written, is not very interesting.<br />Two fussy English women, the nubile Lucy Honeychurch and her older cousin Charlotte Bartlett, are staying in a small hotel (a pension) in Florence, Italy.  There they meet the Emersons, a father and son, who do not seem to have much money and are hinted to be &quot;Socialists,&quot; which reflects a prejudice on the part of the allegers and doesn't even really mean anything within the novel's scope.  Lucy has a brief romance with the son, George, even though she knows he is not quite suitable for her social status.  A few other characters also are introduced in Florence, including two clergymen, Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, and a romance novelist named Miss Lavish.<br />The action shifts back to England, where we meet Lucy's doting mother and frivolous, immature brother Freddy, who could be a progenitor for P.G. Wodehouse's aristocratic loafers.  Lucy is courted by a snobbish young man named Cecil Vyse whom she has known for a few years and accepts his proposal for marriage.  Trouble arises when George Emerson and his father show up as tenants in a nearby cottage, and Lucy must decide whether she is going to submit to social convention and marry Cecil or follow her heart and go with George.  Care to take a wild guess about the outcome?<br />Forster obviously intended this novel to be a comedy, but his humor is stilted and contrived.  There are subtle jokes about English class distinction, blatantly symbolic surnames that sound like they came from the board game &quot;Clue,&quot; juxtaposed sentences that purposely contradict each other for the sake of painfully overt irony, and satirical snippets that affect Oscar Wilde-style wittiness.  The novel's humoristic tour de force is a scene in which Cecil remains oblivious to the fact that Lucy and George had a fling in Italy, even though he reads a direct account of it in a novel penned by Miss Lavish, who fortunately has disguised the names of her hero and heroine.  Simply put, the book is as funny as burnt toast.<br />Colorful but predictable and simplistic, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; may have been an important Edwardian novel, but it seems innocuous compared to the hard realism and bold sexuality of D.H. Lawrence's imminent works.  Even the author himself acknowledges the novel's fabrications when he allows Mr. Beebe to state, &quot;It is odd how we of that Pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another's lives.&quot;  Funny, I was thinking the same thing.fully overt irony, and satirical snippets that affect Oscar Wilde-style wittiness.

Most first-person narrators just kind of lay on the page, passively hoping the reader will sympathize with or care about them; but Eugene Henderson is a three-dimensional creation, arrogant, energetic, restless, engaging the reader with his lively banter and gleeful impudence.  <br />55-year-old Henderson is a millionaire by inheritance, aimlessly sleepwalking through life, married to a ditzy wife, and channeling ancestral spirits by playing his dead father's violin.  Needing a vacation from his family and his dreary normal existence, and feeling that &quot;...it's the destiny of [his] generation of Americans to go out in the world and try to find the wisdom of life,&quot; he travels to Africa and impulsively decides to go off into the wild.  <br />A hired guide named Romilayu leads him to two remote villages.  The first is inhabited by a tribe called the Arnewi.  He observes with delight that the Arnewi village must be older than the city of Ur -- this is what he was looking for, the cradle of civilization, unblemished by the advances of modern society.  Here he finds the natives in a crisis: their precious cattle are dying of thirst because the water in the village cistern is undrinkable.  On his own initiative, he tries to solve their problem; but his plan fails disastrously, and he and Romilayu leave the village in shame. <br />They go to a second village, inhabited by a larger tribe called the Wariri, ruled by a king named Dahfu.  The Wariri are suffering from a drought and go through elaborate rituals in order to conjure rain.  When Henderson unexpectedly helps them bring a deluge, Dahfu proclaims him the &quot;Rain King&quot; and the two become close, almost brotherly, friends.  Henderson learns that Dahfu cannot have complete sovereignty over the tribe until he captures the lion containing the soul of his dead father, the former king, and Dahfu asks Henderson to help him in the hunt.  But human corruption knows no geographical boundaries, and Henderson and Romilayu soon find themselves in a dangerous situation from which it will require all their physical and mental capacities to save themselves.<br />More refined and terser than &quot;The Adventures of Augie March,&quot; &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot; offers a wonderfully balanced mixture of philosophy, suspense, and humor.  While Augie wandered through life looking for a purpose, a goal, Henderson seems to find his, affirming it through his own adventures and taking the reader along for the exhilarating ride.  You'll be cheering for the guy, not because he's the hero, but because he's more human than most of the people you know.	2001-11-05

Lawrence's &quot;The Rainbow&quot; is the story of three generations of a rural English family, focusing on five main characters.  More than just a simple family history, it is about gender conflict and the quest for identity and individualism.  <br />The novel begins with the early life of Tom Brangwen, a simple, poorly educated farmer.  He marries a well-bred Polish widow named Lydia Lensky, who has a young daughter named Anna.  Like any kid with a new parent, Anna is reluctant to adapt to her new environment, but eventually she learns to love Tom like her own father.  When she grows up, she falls in love with Tom's nephew Will, and they get married and have very many children, an extraordinary number by today's standards but understandable back then when there was a higher infant mortality rate.  Their oldest daughter, Ursula, emerges as the most prominent character, the one with whom the last half of the novel is most concerned.   <br />Ursula is nothing like her mother or her grandmother.  She resents her parents' provinciality and her mother's complacency of being kept at home to be a baby-making machine and a domestic servant.  Falling in love with a young man named Anton Skrebensky, she is unwilling to accept the dullness of being a wife.  She rejects the sanctimoniousness and hollowness of religion.  She becomes interested in the Women's Movement, such as it existed in the earliest years of the 1900's.  She finds a new, exciting experience in a lesbian relationship with her teacher, Miss Inger.  She decides to take up a profession, and teaching is one of the very few open to young women of the day.  When given charge of a class, she soon learns that she must abandon her meekness and solicitude and become a stern disciplinarian if she wants to succeed as a teacher, and by doing so she manages to earn the respect of the unruly students and the other teachers.  So ultimately, &quot;The Rainbow&quot; becomes the story of Ursula's (and woman's) self-liberation.    <br />The novel is structurally and thematically enigmatic.  It presents conflicts but does not seek to resolve them.  Its characters exist as dynamic life forms, interacting with and drawing vivacity from each other, and do not merely serve the purpose of advancing the plot, which has no beginning or end.  It challenges conventional Victorian notions of feminine roles and sexual propriety, offering moments of daring sexual innuendo for its time, though necessarily muted by the censors of the day.  While this book is not really a feminist tract, it offers unique insight into the issues of social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.	2001-11-01

The Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges's fictional works are the ultimate celebration of the power of the imagination, each story a unique, glittering gem worthy of careful and repeated inspection.  Combining abstract concepts with familiar elements of the real world, Borges works in a genre that could be called philosophical fantasy -- an exploration of the myriad ways of interpreting and portraying reality and unreality.  <br />I have encountered no writer more eclectic than Borges; there is no place on earth and no time in history in which he is uninterested or unwilling to take inspiration.  He writes about sorcerors, pirates, impostors, hoodlums, samurai, detectives, troglodytes, gauchos, kings, primitive tribes, artifacts, fantastic libraries, imaginary worlds, imaginary books, lost civilizations, and alternate realities with astonishingly equal aplomb.  Much of the writing is immersed in cultural mysticism (the Kabbalah), traditional religions (the Koran, the Talmud, the Bible), mythology (Greek, Arabian, Oriental), philosophy (particularly Schopenhauer), world history, and lore of Borges's own invention.  Motifs of knives, mirrors, and especially labyrinths -- both physical and metaphysical -- recur throughout many of the stories.  <br />The titles alone invoke immediate intrigue: &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths,&quot; &quot;The Library of Babel,&quot; &quot;The Cult of the Phoenix,&quot; &quot;The Immortal,&quot; &quot;The Sect of the Thirty,&quot; &quot;The Mirror and the Mask,&quot; &quot;Toenails,&quot; et cetera.  Borges takes the typical detective story and elevates it to lofty levels of erudition -- one can see how he influenced Umberto Eco.  &quot;Death and the Compass&quot; is a mystery with a geometrical solution, &quot;Ibn-Hakam al-Bokhari, Murdered in His Labyrinth&quot; embellishes its clever plot by merging two disparate cultures, while the eerie &quot;There Are More Things&quot; takes its inspiration from H.P. Lovecraft.  Some stories, like &quot;The House of Asterion&quot; and &quot;Everything and Nothing,&quot; are like riddles, while others are rich romantic tales of the tough barrios of Buenos Aires.   <br />This collection is a marvel -- perfect for engaging your intellect and purging yourself of the mundane.	2001-10-16

The protagonist is a schoolteacher named Niki Jumpei who collects insects as a hobby and, on a holiday, goes to a sandy seashore in search of rare specimens.  Near the shore he finds a most curiously constructed village -- the houses are sunk into individual sand pits.  When he misses the last bus back to civilization, the villagers assign him to spend the night in a house at the bottom of one of the pits.  Dwelling in the house is a nameless woman who must shovel sand out of the pit constantly to keep the entire village from being buried in the encroaching sand dunes.  Soon Niki learns that the villagers have no intention of letting him out of the pit and that he must help the woman with shoveling.  Faced with the prospect of spending the rest of his life imprisoned and forced to labor in the sand pit, he must accustom himself to his new environment and become the woman's sexual mate.<br />Some of the images, especially the strange village and the sand formations, are difficult to envision, but Abe rises to the challenge with beautiful, vivid descriptions.  Similarly, Niki's daring schemes to outwit the implacable villagers who grimly supervise the work are written with the skill of an author who understands and masters the delicate balance between thought and action. <br />The novel is not merely a retelling of the myth of Sisyphus because Niki and the woman's task has a practical, if unrealistic, purpose.  Rather, I see it as an allegory of man's complacency with his existence in the world.  He is not born of his own will, but once alive, he has personal, familial, and communal responsibilities that he must fulfill or else risk physical and social deprivation (starvation, loneliness, societal reproach).  He must consign himself to these responsibilities, and usually he finds something that interests him and makes lifemore bearable -- for some, this may be a chosen profession; for others, a hobby.  (Note how Niki's hobby shifts from collecting insects to discovering a new method of drawing ground water as he assimilates himself to life in the pit.  His interests adjust to fit his environment.)  In fact, our personal interests are the only things by which we individuate ourselves from others in a world where we are all shoveling the same sand out of our own little pits.	2001-10-10

The story concerns two couples: John and Florence Dowell, who are American, and Captain Edward and Leonora Ashburnham, who are English.  One of the first things we learn at the beginning of the book, of which John is the narrator, is that Florence and Edward are presently dead.<br />The two couples met nine years ago at a resort in the Hessian town of Nauheim, noted for its salt springs which are used to treat heart and nerve diseases; Florence, who indeed has a bad heart condition, is there to convalesce.  Over the years Florence and Edward fall in love, unbeknownst to John but not to Leonora.<br />Both marriages were built on shaky foundations.  John's and Florence's backgrounds are differentiated financially (she is from an extremely wealthy family; he isn't) and the Ashburnhams religiously (Edward is Protestant; Leonora is Catholic).  But the roots of their marital problems are more personal.  Florence is a social climber and aspires to associate with English nobility, while John is ingenuous, naive in practical matters, and not very interested in money.  Edward has a history of indiscriminate love affairs (initiated by a misunderstood sexual advance), immoderate gambling, and imprudent spending.  His and Leonora's marriage has grown cool and passionless and is gradually turning into a state of mutual hatred, exacerbated by the presence of a girl named Nancy Rufford whom both Edward and John love.<br />John is not the best of narrators; he tends to ramble and comes off as high-strung and jittery, like he's had too much caffeine.  The reader gets the impression this personality trait of his may have been one of the reasons his wife sought an extramarital affair.  It is easy to symphathize with this confused man for his misfortune but not for his gullibility.  As he points out at the end of the book, everything everybody wanted was available to each, but eventually nobody got what he or she wanted.  It is this conclusion that makes this &quot;the saddest story&quot; John had ever heard.<br />This is the kind of story that F. Scott Fitzgerald could have written, only he would have let the scenes develop with more dialogue, and I think he would have focused more on the class distinction aspect.  &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; is nowhere near the saddest story *I* have ever heard, but it does invoke a fair amount of emphathy for these people who only wanted to be happy but ended up in undesirable situations they were unable or unlikely to avoid or foresee.confused man for his misfortune but not for his gullibility.

Like an imaginary Bible, it is the story of the beginning and almost apocalyptic end of a world, albeit a microcosm.  This &quot;world&quot; is a South American village called Macondo, of which one of the founders is a man named Jose Arcadio Buendia.  The novel tells the story of Buendia and five generations of his descendants, the last of whom is carried away by ants (yes, ants) to be devoured.  Consider it &quot;The Rise and Fall of the House of Buendia.&quot;  Or, metaphorically, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Man.&quot;  <BR>  <BR>Garcia Marquez writes as though he were spinning a rug of a wildly chaotic and exotic pattern on a loom.  Such things as flying carpets, an insomnia plague, a levitating priest, a trickle of human blood that propels itself through village streets, a rainfall of yellow flowers, a girl whose erotic fragrance drives men to acts of desperation, a man whose appearances are preceded by a swarm of butterflies, &quot;invisible&quot; doctors, a future-telling witch who lives to an unthinkable age, and a five-year-long rainfall are just some of the wonders to be found within its pages.  However, there is an eerie cohesion that blends these elements with the realistic backdrop of the narrative, so that the novel feels as natural as walking down the street.  For comparison's sake, it contains the kind of mixture of fantasy and realism used by writers like Gunter Grass and Salman Rushdie.    <br />The novel does not have an arching plotline; it is more like a collection of connected anecdotes, but there is an overall plan to the events which unite the Buendia dynasty.  The narrative has a tendency to fast forward and reverse chronologically so that a situation introduced early is resolved later in the action, usually with an ironic surprise.  For example, the novel begins with Jose's son, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, facing a firing squad; how he got into this predicament is explained later, along with his uncanny knack for escaping death.  <br />The idiosyncrasies of the characters are another focus of the novel.  Jose, the patriarch, has a fascination with new gadgets sold to him by a gypsy named Melquiades and dabbles perseveringly in alchemy.  Aureliano, a metalworker who fabricates little fishes out of gold, proclaims himself a Colonel and leads dozens of unsuccessful Liberal revolts against his country's Conservative government.  Rebeca, Jose's adopted daughter, arrives at Jose's house carrying the bones of her deceased biological parents in a sack and has a nervous habit of eating dirt.  Jose's wife, Ursula, acts as the family's moral backbone and rational center.  The history and fate of the members of the Buendia family are prophesied by Melquiades, whose cryptic parchments are left after his death for one of Jose's descendants to decipher.  Also documented is Macondo's growth from a primitive village to a town thriving with commerce (including an ill-fated banana company), entertainment, and the latest technology.   <br />This is truly one of the best novels I have ever read.  It transcends its time and place by virtue of being mythical and universal.  The last paragraph in particular is incredibly profound and seems to summarize not only the novel but mankind's existence; consider how it relates to religious concepts of creation, destruction, and human sin.  Few novels offer greater scope, imagination, imagery, or ideas.	2001-10-01

It takes place in 1938 in the poor Irish neighborhoods of Albany, New York, still reeling from the Depression.<br />The protagonist is a 58-year-old bum named Francis Phelan.  He didn't spend his whole adult life as a bum, though -- he used to be a third baseman for the Washington Senators, and a pretty good one at that.  But a history of personal problems has brought him to his present station in life.  It all started when, at twenty-one, he killed a scab trolley car conductor during a workers' strike,  for which he was neither caught nor punished.  Fifteen years later, his baby son died when he accidentally dropped him on the floor.  Since then, he has been in self-imposed exile from his wife and his other two children, wandering around the country as a vagrant, a time in which he happened to kill another bum in a fight.  <br />Eventually Francis returned to Albany where, destitute and homeless, he works at odd jobs like grave digging and junk hauling.  He maintains a somewhat distant relationship with his family; even though they love and forgive him and would like him to be a part of their lives once again, his lingering guilt keeps him from fully reaching out to them.  Adding to his guilt is the fact that the story of his crime at the trolley strike was the subject of a play by a local writer, whose melodramatic, manipulative seductress of a wife had been Francis's first love.     <br />On the street, he drinks and hangs out with several other homeless friends, including a woman named Helen to whom promiscuity is a way to get a place to sleep on a cold night.  Helen is an archetypal tragic figure; she came from an affluent family and was studying at Vassar to be a classical pianist when her father committed suicide, leaving insufficient funds for her to continue.  Now, fattened and disfigured by a tumorous stomach, she drinks away her sorrows while waiting for death.  <br />The chronological structure of the novel is fairly complex, made more so by Francis's common subconscious visions of ghosts from his past, where he tries to rationalize his actions.  There are recurring motifs of junk and weeds, symbols of the uselessness and ugliness of the unpleasant lives these homeless people suffer or have brought upon themselves to suffer.  Despite the overall bleakness, however, some of the characters almost seem to enjoy their lives, even if just to drink; they're inspirited by their fatalism.  Likewise, Francis -- a poor, hardworking man who made a few mistakes in his life and is willing to do the right thing by his family, and also a sort of labor &quot;hero&quot; with regard to the trolley strike incident -- often reminded me of Tom Joad, making this novel a worthy successor to John Steinbeck's epics of the down-and-out.	2001-09-24
US	49396726	REFSNGS6GS0VH	068971310X	712926184	The Wind in the Willows	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A great work for readers of all ages	I doubted if a children's book could command my interest at this advanced stage of my life, but I have to say that &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; completely enthralled me.  It is the story of four personified animals, the eponymously named Mole, Water Rat, Badger, and Toad, who live on or near a river that runs through an idyllic countryside obviously modeled on Edwardian England.  In their world, physical size with regard to objects and other animals doesn't follow any kind of common logic or consistency; the animals seem to be simultaneously as big as humans and small enough to live in their own natural habitats.  <br />The animals have vivid human personalities.  Mole is timorous and meek, Rat is adventurous and poetic, Badger is unpredictable but protective and mean when he needs to be.  Toad, however, is the most salient figure; he is wealthy, greedy, conceited, and clumsy, and he lives in a stately manor called Toad Hall.  Mole and Rat's interests are simple; they enjoy boating down the river and socializing with other animals, including otters, field mice, and a seafaring Rat who regales the Water Rat with eloquent tales of his voyages around the world.  They even encounter the god Pan, in a strangely ecclesiastical moment.  <br />Toad's picaresque adventures throughout the book provide a counterpoint to Mole and Rat's more pastoral activities.  Toad is so captivated with the idea of faster and faster transportation that when a motor-car overtakes and wrecks his horse-drawn cart in the road, he can only watch the departing vehicle in avaricious rapture.  So then he buys car after expensive car, wrecking each one with his incompetent driving.  Despite his friends' attempts to cure him of his obsession, he steals a car in a frenzy and is consequently thrown in jail.  However, he escapes by means of a ridiculous ruse and, after many more adventures, finally returns to his native river-bank only to find that Toad Hall has been taken over by gun-toting stoats, weasels, and ferrets.  (Note the parallels to Homer's Odyssey here.)  Fortunately, his friends rise to the occasion to help him reclaim his home, after which he resolves to learn some modesty.  <br />A great thing about the book is that Grahame uses many words that may be new or unfamiliar to young readers, but they're used in such a way that kids may be able to figure out their meanings by context.  Also, while there are lessons to be learned through the animals' (especially Toad's) examples, there is no heavy-handed moralism to dilute the book's enjoyability.  Clearly this is a work of the utmost creativity and imagination and demands the adult reader expand his or her mind to the realms of childlike wonder.	2001-09-24
US	49396726	R1FM96SXRNAPLN	0140185976	304026032	The Moon and Sixpence (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A portrait of an artist	Inspired by the life of Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; is the story of a bourgeois, seemingly philistine man who completely transforms his life with the inexorable urge to be an artist.  The man is Charles Strickland, a middle-class London stockbroker with a wife and two children, and the story is told in the first person by a nameless narrator who happens to make Strickland's acquaintance.  One day, Strickland abandons his family and runs off to Paris, leaving no suitable explanation.  The narrator, on Strickland's wife's entreaty, trails him to a seedy hotel, where he reveals a somewhat rude disposition and explains that he's always wanted to be a painter but was forced into business by his father.  He plans to live in Paris and paint and has no intention to return to his family and his old life.<br />In Paris a few years later, the narrator introduces us to a friend of his, a Dutch painter named Dirk Stroeve who happens to have made Strickland's acquaintance.  Stroeve is a comical, pathetic figure who is not much of a talent himself, but he tells the narrator that Strickland has some real genius that nobody seems to recognize.  Strickland, in the meantime, has isolated himself in poverty and self-absorption and become a surly, insufferable, misogynistic boor who repays Stroeve's kindness and friendship by insulting his work, seducing his wife, and kicking him out of his own home.<br />Strickland later moves to Marseilles and eventually to Tahiti where he lives the rest of his short life, afflicted with leprosy and inspired to create his most profound and beautiful works of art.  The narrator goes there years after Strickland's death and collects stories about his final years on the picturesque tropical island from various people who came into contact with him.  It turns out that Strickland's paintings, once generally considered junk, are now priceless masterpieces.<br />Maugham has been one of my favorite writers since I read &quot;Of Human Bondage,&quot; and this novel offers more of his straightforward, thoughtful prose with regard to describing the life and experiences of a man who realizes he doesn't quite fit in with the world and strives to make his life meaningful to himself, if not to others.  Charles Strickland's life exemplifies the theme of many existentialist novels that were to be written throughout the 20th Century -- living your life doing what you truly want to do rather than vainly pursuing what will make you the most money or please your family or impress your friends.  The culmination of Strickland's life in Tahiti symbolizes man's return to the Garden of Eden, the return to innocence, the rejection of materialism; which may have been Gauguin's ideal for humanity.	2001-09-18

Henry James's &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; presents a detailed study of human nature and motivations with regard to love and money and the social differences that separate Europe and America.  What distinguishes James's work is its reversal of traditional gender roles -- the few male characters are curiously emasculated and subservient while the female characters wield all the power, influence, and money. <br />The novel is mostly set in London, where one of the main female characters, a young woman named Kate Croy, is affianced to a journalist named Merton Densher.  Her Aunt Maud gives her financial support and likes Merton well enough but does not approve of her marrying the impecunious young man, preferring she marry the higher-bred Lord Mark (who is not particularly wealthy either) instead.<br />Kate and Merton befriend a young New York heiress named Milly Theale, who is traveling throughout Europe with an American companion named Susan Stringham and has decided to remain in London a while to assimilate herself to the society.  She has some kind of serious illness, for which she consults and confides in a doctor named Sir Luke Strett.  Eventually, Kate and Merton decide to use Milly's friendship and good nature to their own advantage.  Kate tells Merton to marry Milly so that when she (presumably soon) dies of her illness, he will inherit her money and then he and Kate can get married.  Merton courts Milly in Venice, but he must also vie with Lord Mark's affections for Milly.  Milly's final action results in a conflict which embitters Kate and Merton's feelings for each other.<br />All these people have two things in common:  They're boring, and I don't care about them.  They're literary mannequins, dressed up very nicely but going nowhere in a novel that insists on examining in excruciating detail every hollow nook and cranny of their psyches.  Granted, Henry James is a master of the English language, writing with a level of sophistication and impressionism found nowhere else.  However, he expends too much effort disrupting the narrative flow with non-events, bland scenes, and shallow conversations.  As a result, I regretfully could not invoke much interest in the story.	2001-09-17

The terrorist activity described in this novel apparently is based loosely on a real incident, but Conrad avoids specifying any actual political motivations and instead makes his story as basic and general as possible.<br />The &quot;terrorist&quot; is a most unassuming man named Mr. Verloc.  He runs a  stationery and news store in London where he lives with his wife Winnie, her mother, and her mildly retarded brother Stevie.  For the past eleven years he has been drawing pay from an unspecified foreign Embassy for occasional information on the activities of an anarchist organization, the &quot;local chapter&quot; of which is comprised of a bunch of malcontent duffers whom he has managed to befriend.  An official at the Embassy, Mr. Vladimir, thinks Verloc is not very bright and plans to use him as an agent provocateur to get the anarchist organization in trouble.  He suggests to Verloc to blow up an unlikely but symbolic target, the Greenwich Observatory; as the source of the prime meridian or zero-degree longitude, it's like the seam of the world.  Using a bomb made by another of society's outcasts, a creepy fellow known only as the Professor, Verloc enlists Stevie's help to carry out his scheme.<br />Fast forward to immediately after the (unsuccessful) bomb blast: Police Chief Inspector Heat is investigating the incident, reconstructing the crime back to its source, and, interestingly enough, competing with his own superior officer.  The post-blast events are where the novel really develops unexpectedly, in which we see what kind of tenuous relationship Verloc has with his wife, and the cruel treachery of one of his dishonest comrades.  The structure of the novel is remarkable in the way it establishes the chronology of events, sets the pacing, and lets the scenes unfold as naturally as if they were being staged.<br />I found this novel to be a lot of fun and, despite the serious subject matter and the fact that it was considered quite violent for its time, actually kind of funny.  I see it as not an attempt at a spy story or &quot;thriller&quot; but rather an early example of black humor, in which the narrative is filled with wry wit and each character is given a certain comical edge as if Conrad were making subtle fun of the whole business.  It is a book that defies expectations, discards formulas, and immerses itself in the tremendous possibilities of the creativity of great literature.	2001-09-10

His professional career begins with an ephemeral job at McGraw-Hill reviewing painfully bad manuscripts. After he (intentionally and humorously) gets himself fired, he can no longer afford to live in Manhattan, so he moves to the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn and gets a room at a boarding house inhabited mostly by Jews. There, while beginning work on a novel, he meets a pair of unlikely lovers: Nathan Landau, who works for a drug company, and his girlfriend Sophie Zawistowska, a recent immigrant and concentration camp survivor.<br />Stingo befriends these two, but he is uneasy about Nathan, who, on the one hand, is highly intelligent, has a wide variety of knowledge and interests, and enthusiastically encourages Stingo's writing career, but on the other hand has a volatile, often violent, personality and relationship with Sophie. Stingo is secretly attracted to Sophie and, in conversations with her, soon learns that she is not Jewish but a Polish Catholic. In fact, one of Nathan's quirks is that he likes to control Sophie by laying a guilt trip on her with the fact that she escaped the fate of so many Jews. She, in turn, has many secrets about her past life that she doesn't want to reveal to Nathan. <br />Throughout the course of the novel, Sophie tells Stingo her life story in gradual installments. Her father, although a vocal anti-Semite, was killed by the Nazis along with her husband because they were university professors. In Warsaw, she was arrested after she fellin with a Polish resistance group and was sent to Auschwitz. Upon arrival there, she was forced to make a &quot;choice&quot; so evil and inhuman, it would be every person's most unimaginable nightmare. It is this choice, one which, ironically, the Jewish prisoners did not have the chance to make, which makes this novel not just another Holocaust story.<br />Sophie and Nathan are one of the most dramatically tragic couples in literature. They seem to share a deathwish that keeps them together, no matter how abusive and destructive their relationship. There is a point in the novel when Stingo and Sophie must leave New York quickly to escape Nathan's potentially murderous actions, but she realizes that she cannot be without him. After living through the Holocaust, she has nothing left to fear; the only way she can redeem the most terrible choice she had to make in her life is to be with this man who promises her nothing but death.	2001-09-04

His writing, pulsating with the restless and reckless rhythms of the Jazz Age, finds its strength in empathy, its uncanny ability to describe emotions with clever, original metaphors. You find yourself pitying the problems of these perfectly created characters, but you'd still like to be one of them. <br />&quot;Tender is the Night&quot; turns our attention to several American expatriates who live, work, and play in the French Riviera and various fashionable locations around Europe in the 1920's. At the center of the novel are an affluent young couple, Dick and Nicole Diver, whose marriage has been built on a shaky foundation. Dick is a prominent psychiatrist of modest means who met Nicole when she was a patient under his care in a Swiss sanitarium. Diagnosed as a schizophrenic, Nicole is still dangerously capricious and fragile. She is the daughter of a fabulously wealthy American man with a dirty secret, and she has a frigid, highly protective older sister called Baby who attempts to be the stabilizing factor in the Divers' lives. Dick and Nicole have two children whose infrequent mention is indicative of their relatively low level of love for them. <br />One day on the beach at the Riviera, a young American movie actress named Rosemary Hoyt almost literally swims into the Divers' lives and quickly falls in love with Dick. Her mother encourages the affair, thinking Rosemary needs such risque life experiences to stimulate her passion. Nicole also has an extramarital affair with a magnetic playboy named Tommy Barban. By the end of the book, it is disheartening to see that Dick has to pay the price for both of their infidelities and Nicole, although &quot;cured&quot; to the point that she no longer needs his help, is still spoiled and frivolous. (That the rich can render themselves impervious to misfortunes and go on with their carefree lives, leaving the less fortunate to pick up the pieces, was also a major theme in &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;) <br />The scenes play out against a picturesque European backdrop populated by a host of interesting characters, including the flighty Abe and Mary North, the awkward McKiscos, the haughty Lady Caroline Sibley-Biers, who gets her comeuppance most satisfactorily, and Collis Clay, a likeable collegiate fellow who hangs around Rosemary and seems to have wandered way outside his cultural element. <br />This novel, the last Fitzgerald completed, reinforces his position as perhaps the greatest American prose stylist. His writing is like literary ambrosia; it bathes the tired, gray world in vibrant color and leaves it basking in a rosy hue. The experience of reading it is similar to that of listening to the most brilliant, sublime music ever composed or eating the most delicious food ever prepared -- something to be savored once in a long while if only to remind ourselves how good things can be.	2001-08-27

After a love affair with an actress goes terribly wrong, he notices that his portrait has altered itself in a curious way.  He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh.  The novel offers some weighty questions:  Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal?  Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality?  Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?<br />As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his.  Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone.  With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel.  Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point?  This is an intriguing novel that combines elements of gothic horror and social satire, but it is marred by too many moments of unintentional goofiness.	2001-08-23

He is living in his grandparents' old house in a small town in northern California where, confined to a wheelchair, he nobly struggles to remain independent despite requiring considerable medical and secretarial assistance.  A rather curmudgeonly attitude about the relatively loose morality of modern (as of 1970) times as compared to the Victorian sensibilities of his grandparents pervades much of his writing and his discussions with his hippie typist, Shelly.<br />His grandfather, Oliver Ward, was a mining engineer and, because of the transitory nature of the profession, needed to move his family to California, Colorado, Mexico, and Idaho, all the while building his skills by working as a mapper, an inspector, a manager, an irrigation canal designer, and a consultant for the U.S. Geological Survey.  His wife Susan (Lyman's grandmother) was a talented commercial artist and writer who worked as a book illustrator and a magazine correspondent.  She is portrayed as a supportive, proud woman who stood by her husband through thick and thin and boldly endured life on the rough uncivilized frontier without ever shedding the gentility of her Quaker upbringing.  However, their marriage certainly was not always a bed of roses; it was strained by his career setbacks and drinking, tested by her attraction to another man, and nearly destroyed by a tragedy, after which there was too much pain for things ever to be the same again.   <br />There are several interesting themes to this novel.  The most noticeable is that Lyman, writing in the first person, intersperses the narration of his grandparents' lives with scenes of his own, which allows him to compare various aspects of the generations of the Baby Boomers with the Victorians.  Throughthis narration technique, he is also able to compare the recipes of his grandparents' successful marriage with his own failed one.  And most appreciated by me is that the novel gives an uncommon look at the life of an engineer -- a profession which is underrepresented in literature -- who is living and working in unglamorous, dangerous conditions, and whose work is even more significant for his contributions to the construction of civilization in the frontier.  And finally, Stegner's prose and masterful descriptions of Western scenery are nothing short of excellent.	2001-08-20

There is an incredible amount of narrative inventiveness on every page, employing a wild concoction of dry humor, non sequiturs, bizarre characters with puns for names, and an endless barrage of references to a wide variety of pop culture, science, and technology.  This is the first novel I've read that has introduced the concept of entropy as a narrative device.  <br />The protagonist is a woman named Oedipa Maas who, when the novel begins, learns that her former boyfriend, the wealthy Pierce Inverarity, has died and designated her to be the executor of his enormous estate.  Inverarity's assets include vast stretches of property, a significant stamp collection, and many shares in an aerospace corporation called Yoyodyne.  As Oedipa goes through her late boyfriend's will, aided by a lawyer named Metzger who works for Inverarity's law firm, she learns about a series of secret societies and strange groups of people involved in a sort of renegade postal system called Tristero.  She starts seeing ubiquitous cryptic diagrams of a simple horn, a symbol with a seemingly infinite number of meanings.  Every clue she uncovers about Tristero and the horn leads haphazardly to another, like a brainstorm, or a free association of ideas.  <br />This is a novel that demands analysis but defies explanation.  My initial interpretation was that it's an anarchistic satire of the military-industrial-government complex, but it's deeper than that.  Like Vladimir Nabokov's &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; it establishes a very complicated relationship between the author and the reader, where Pynchon seems to be tricking the reader in the same way that Oedipa is unsure if she is witnessing a worldwide conspiracy or if she is merely the victim of an elaborate prank.  By presenting Oedipa's investigation to be either circular, aimless, or inconsequential, the novel seems to satirize the efforts of people who try to find order in the universe.  Pynchon uses the concept of entropy to illustrate that the more effort (physical and mental) we put into controlling the universe, the more random it becomes.	2001-08-10

There must have been a glut of war novels published in the wake of World War II, so it's indicative of the high quality of Norman Mailer's &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; that its popularity and acclaim have survived when so many others have been forgotten.  What makes it so powerful is its uncompromising depiction of brutal front-line combat in scenes so well written that it's easy to forgive the book for its occasionally banal dialogue.  <br />The setting is a fictitious South Pacific island called Anopopei which is held by the Japanese.  The U.S. Army has launched a campaign to take command of the island by landing six thousand troops there to confront the defensive line established by the opposing Japanese General Toyaku.  Because this is fictional, I assume that the island is supposed to be a desirable strategic position because the purpose of the mission in relation to the real war is never clearly explained.  In charge of the invasion is a Machiavellian General named Cummings who thinks soldiers are motivated best by fear.  To defeat Toyaku's line, Cummings devises a plan tailored to the island's particular geography and assigns a  reconnaissance squad to the dangerous mission, putting his rebellious and idealistic aide, Lieutenant Hearn, in charge.  What the men find out is that the island's natural environment is a more formidable enemy than the Japanese could ever be.  <br />The story focuses mainly on the dozen or so men in the reconnaissance squad.  Their personal backgrounds vary greatly, although their personalities don't differ so much that it's easy to tell them apart except by name.  The two that stand out the most are Roth and Goldstein, two Jewish soldiers who are made to feel like outcasts due to casual anti-semitism in the squad.  Short sections entitled &quot;The Time Machine&quot; provide glimpses of each soldier's personal history -- how they came to be what they are.  They are, for the most part, normal men with understandable fears of things like being wounded or killed and the possibility of their wives' infidelity while they are gone.  <br />Reading this novel is like descending into a hellish abyss.  It is very long and goes into extensive detail about all aspects of wartime life on the island: marching through the jungle in its greenhouse-like heat, hauling heavy equipment through muddy trails and over mountainous terrain, listening to the sporadic bursts of machine gun fire.  The squad's treacherous reconnaissance mission is an almost Sisyphean task in which there is no honor or glory to be reaped from their efforts, just tired muscles and broken bodies.  And yet they must continue onward, commanded by a cold and distant master plan that is concerned more with the gain of land than the loss of people.  This is more than just a suspenseful war story; it is an eye-opening allegory about the apparent purposelessness of mankind's labor and suffering throughout history.	2001-08-07

The novel seems influenced by Sherwood Anderson's &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; in its portrayal of &quot;grotesques,&quot; emotionally or behaviorally defective people on the fringe of society, but its tone is much more vibrant and frenetic; if &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; is a petting zoo, &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; is a three-ring circus. <br />At the center of the action is an artist and scene designer named Tod Hackett.  He observes southern California with a sort of concerned detachment; he sees it as a wasteland of incongruous, tacky architecture and rootless people who come here to die.  His discontent is manifested in his extracurricular plan to paint a canvas called &quot;The Burning of Los Angeles.&quot;  <br />Even though Tod may be considered the main character, he's the least interesting member of the cast; he's like the &quot;straight man&quot; in a comedy team.  He's in love with an aspiring actress and occasional prostitute named Faye Greener who likes to use men.  She has managed to hook a shy, lonely unemployed hotel bookkeeper named Homer Simpson (!) who moved to L.A. from Iowa for his health.  Homer has compulsively fidgety hands and occasionally even exhibits the simplemindedness of his bald, mustard-colored cartoon namesake.  Faye is also attracted to a lanky cowboy named Earle Shoop who works in a Sunset Boulevard saddlery store, does occasional movie work, and doesn't seem to know he's a caricature.<br />There is a cavalcade of other colorful characters, including Faye's father Harry, an ex-vaudeville clown who is now peddling silver polish door-to-door; Abe Kusich, a drunken dwarf; Claude Estee, a successful screenwriter who has a rubber sculpture of dead horse in his swimmingpool; Joan Schwartzen, a loud, lewd harridan, who is probably Phyllis Diller's progenitor; Miguel, Earle's chicken-tending Mexican friend; and last but not least, Adore Loomis, an obnoxious aspiring kid star.<br />The novel focuses on the lives of these fringe characters rather than  moviemaking, which allows West to demonstrate that he excels at writing unusual, difficult scenes -- a screening of a porn flick, a cockfight, a riot at a movie premiere.  The inventiveness, energy, and attitude here cannot be overstated; never have I read a novel that delights so much in pathetic human oddity, in mixing its characters into a violent Molotov cocktail and observing the comical results with jubilation.	2001-07-27

To say Miss Brodie's teaching methods are unorthodox is an understatement.  She prefers taking her students to the theater and art galleries to classroom instruction, favors subjects irrelevant to the traditional school curriculum, disdains science and mathematics, believes spirituality and wisdom can be attained only through art, and is fascinated with fascism, heartily endorsing the policies of Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco.  Her &quot;prime&quot; refers to the time in her life when she is able to wield a sphere of influence over her students.<br />For a teacher, Miss Brodie is strangely self-absorbed; she would rather spend time discussing the minutiae of her own life with her students instead of paying attention to their interests and welfare.  But she is possessive of them all the same.  She seems to see them as extensions of herself and wants to live vicariously through them; the reader gets the impression that she is subtly encouraging her students to become sexually active with a male art teacher whom she herself loves.  In fact, there is some playful innuendo while the art teacher paints the girls' portraits:  &quot;One day,&quot; he tells one of the girls, &quot;I would like to do all you Brodie girls, one by one and then all together.&quot;<br />Lest you think this sounds like simplistic prurient drivel for adolescent girls, it should be mentioned that there is some hauntingly deep symbolism (one of the girls, now a nun, grips the bars of a grille when her old school friends come to visit her at the convent) woven into the themes of influence, manipulation, and betrayal:  When Miss Brodie is betrayed by one of her students and loses her job, she realizes that there is a limit to which she can manipulate her students; her prime is over.	2001-07-23

When you hear in the news that a plane has crashed, killing hundreds of people, do you wonder about your fortune not to have been on board?  Or when you drive by a car accident on the highway, does it occur to you that if you had been only a few minutes earlier, you might have been involved in the wreck?  &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; is a novel that wonders about these things -- whether our lives are governed by the randomness of fate or whether we &quot;deserve&quot; what happens to us.  <br />It is the story of five people in Peru who, one day, are crossing a rope-and-plank bridge which suddenly collapses, spilling them into a chasm.  A studious monk named Brother Juniper witnesses the catastrophe and determines to learn about the lives of the victims and find out whether they were &quot;chosen&quot; for this fate or whether it was just a matter of innocently being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br />The victims are a noblewoman named the Marquesa de Montemayor, who was returning from a shrine where she was praying for her pregnant daughter; the Marquesa's orphaned and loyal maid Pepita; Esteban, a suicidal young man who was despondent over the recent death of his twin brother; a man called Uncle Pio, who liked to nurture his interest in women, Spanish literature, and drama; and a little boy in Uncle Pio's care named Don Jaime.  All these people's lives were connected in some way to a vampish actress named Camila Perichole, whose presence in the novel provides links between the characters and events.  <br />Brother Juniper tries but fails to correlate the lives these people led with their deaths.  Unable to conclude that God unconditionally punishes all sinners and rewards all saints, he is promptly burned as a heretic.  He smiles as he dies, knowing that his own death ironically refutes the beliefs of his accusers.	2001-07-20

One evening before embarking on his new job, Walter encounters a mysterious young woman, dressed in white, wandering the roads outside of London.  He doesn't get her name, but he helps her to her destination before finding out that she has escaped from a mental asylum.  <br />One of the two wards Walter is to instruct is a beautiful young woman named Laura Fairlie who happens to bear a striking resemblance to the woman in white he had met accidentally.  He and Laura fall in love with each other, but she is engaged to be married to a baronet named Sir Percival Glyde, many years her senior.  Laura's half-sister, Marian Halcombe, doesn't like the guy -- or his jovial but devious Italian friend, Count Fosco, who happens to be married to Laura's aunt.  And from there, a death, an inheritance, and a falsification of identity add to the complications.  <br />Most of the narration is done by Walter, but Collins lets other characters give their points of view on certain events, as though we were hearing their testimonies at a trial.  What is most intriguing about this approach is that, during the early parts of the novel when these people are giving their narratives, we know that a crime has been committed but we are still not exactly sure of its nature.  Collins is good at throwing around red herrings to tease the reader into making false guesses and jumping to conclusions.  <br />There is no cause for complaint about the plot, which is air-tight with a minimum of contrivances.  In fact, the scheme that the villains invent is so clever and solid and runs so smoothly that they never have to resort to violence or attempts on anyone's life to ensure their success; and so, unfortunately for me, the situations never feel as suspenseful as they could.  It's a good, tense book; I just think that Collins pulled some punches with the villainy.	2001-07-18

Thomas E. Dewey, the special public prosecutor of New York who later was to run for president against Roosevelt and Truman, is making a name for himself by going after mob figures, and Dutch Schultz is one of his prime targets.  Dutch's gang is involved in the operation of breweries, nightclubs, and labor unions, and they're not shy about disposing of their enemies through symbolically gruesome means, as we see what happens to two scab window washers.  To evade taxes they launder their money through a small town upstate called Onondaga.  <br />Billy becomes attracted to the flamboyant gang and slowly ingratiates his way inside by doing small jobs for them.  Besides the charismatic but tragic Dutch, other members include the friendly Otto Berman, who loves playing with numbers and becomes Billy's fatherly mentor, the brutish muscle Lulu, the silently perceptive Irving, and Mickey the driver.  Billy narrates in the first person with a unique voice, using run-on sentences that display his enthusiasm to be playing with the big boys.<br />The novel begins &quot;in medias res&quot; with a scene of one of Dutch's disloyal henchmen being fitted for a pair of cement shoes.  The man's girlfriend, a voluptuous high-society blonde with a complicated private life, becomes Dutch's moll, and Dutch gives Billy the assignment to keep her company when the gang hides out in Onondaga for the summer.  Eventually Billy realizes that her life might be in danger as a possible witness to her ex-boyfriend's murder, and one of the best parts of the novel is his clever plan to get her out of harm's way.  In the novel's tense climax, Dutch plots to assassinate Dewey, an event which, if carried out, would certainly change the course of history as we know it. <br />As in &quot;Ragtime,&quot; Doctorowis eminently able to evoke a romantic but realistic New York City of a time long past that perhaps was quieter but not necessarily more innocent sexually or morally.  Doctorow obviously enjoys using the city and figures from history as a canvas on which to create his fiction, and his joy is infectious to the reader.  I certainly wish I could have spent a teenage summer having Billy's experiences.  Invoking the excitement of a boyhood adventure in an entirely original milieu, written with maturity and panache, &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; is a novel Mark Twain would have saluted.	2001-07-10

John &quot;Binx&quot; Bolling is a 29-year-old New Orleans stockbroker who works for his uncle.  He is obsessed with a &quot;search,&quot; defined by him as &quot;what anyone would undertake if he were not sunk in the everydayness of his own life.&quot;  Maybe that's why the only thing he really enjoys in life is going to the movies; there is something magical about the silver screen that makes the lives of the people in the movies seem special compared to his own.  As if to emulate the rashness of the movies, he has made a habit of dating his secretaries, the latest of whom is a lively girl named Sharon who can teach him a thing or two about capriciousness.   <br />Binx has a younger cousin named Kate who is something between a sister and a girlfriend to him.  Six years ago her fiance died in a car accident, and since then she has been neurotic, nervous, and moody, and denies that her pill-swallowing episodes are suicide attempts.  Her stepmother (Binx's aunt) refuses to let her be an adult and is furious with Binx when he takes her with him on a business trip to Chicago.  Obviously Binx and Kate are in love with each other, but their relationship is difficult to understand.<br />Unlike in the movies, there are not many events in &quot;The Moviegoer&quot;; it is more about character development and the complexity of social and familial intercourse.  We meet Binx's mother, stepfather, and many half-brothers and sisters, whose rustic lives on a bayou contrast sharply with the genteel Southern aristocracy of his aunt and uncle.  Walker Percy writes like a cross between F. Scott Fitzgerald, employing lush metaphorical prose, and Flannery O'Connor, exhibiting a distinctly Southern flair steeped in Catholic imagery.  The synergy of these elements has created quite a pleasant short novel.	2001-07-05

It is written in the first person by a protagonist whose name we never learn; by keeping him anonymous, we are able to relate to him better, and it helps to emphasize his &quot;invisibility&quot; with respect to the world.  We know that he is a young black man, comes from somewhere in the South, is a bright student, and is thoughtful, introspective, positive, and ambitious.  This novel is about how he is used, abused, and transformed into a cynic, but its tone is ironic rather than angry or bitter.<br />The novel begins just after his high school graduation, when he is invited to give a speech at a party for his hometown's most prominent white citizens.  They award him a college scholarship, but they also want him to participate in a battle royal where he must fight other young black men for money while the white men watch with delight.<br />With the intention of becoming an educator, he attends a black college whose president is an arrogant pedagogue named Dr. Bledsoe.  Assigned to be a campus chauffeur, he innocently takes a visiting white trustee of the college on an extended tour (on the trustee's request) to the cottage of an incestuous sharecropper and then to a raucous roadhouse.  Bledsoe is enraged when he learns of this excursion and, as punishment for the embarrassment he imagines this has caused the college, gives the protagonist a &quot;vacation&quot; and sends him to New York with a promise to refer him for a job with one of the college's wealthy trustees.<br />Through a cruel trick played on him by Bledsoe, the protagonist ends up working at a paint factory in Long Island for tyrannical bosses, but not for long.  He falls in with a group called the Brotherhood, a vaguely Communist organization that promotes humanism and racial harmony, and is hired to speak at rallies in Harlem.  This fulfills his ambition to become a leader and a voice of the community; even though his fiery speeches are mostly platitudinous, they're what his audiences want to hear.<br />As a public speaker advocating multiracial brotherhood, he must contend with a vociferous black nationalist named Ras the Exhorter, who considers the protagonist a traitor to his race.  When the murder of a young black man by a policeman incites a riot in Harlem, the protagonist realizes that the Brotherhood was just using him as a tool to aggravate Ras and divide the black community upon &quot;with-us&quot;/&quot;against-us&quot; lines.<br />The protagonist's personal condition has a universality in that everyone is born, lives, and dies without a purpose (except maybe a divined one), often leaving no trace of ever having existed in the grand scheme of things.  It is this type of person that the protagonist refers to as &quot;invisible&quot; (&quot;We who write no novels, histories or other books&quot;), includes himself among the unseen, and strives to break out of this condition.<br />An important motif in the novel is that the protagonist is treated with condescension at almost every step in his life, not only by whites who ostensibly are helping him but also by blacks who want to display him to white people as a symbol of black progress.  Indeed, the deferential placement of the novel at #19 on the Modern Library's list of the best English-language novels of the 20th Century ironically illustrates this theme.

Set in Scotland in 1751, &quot;Kidnapped&quot; is about a recently orphaned 17-year-old boy named David Balfour who leaves his childhood village to see his uncle Ebenezer and hopefully find some employment.  Ebenezer, a disagreeable miser living in a large decrepit house, reluctantly lets David live with him, but soon it becomes apparent to David that, for unknown reasons, his uncle is trying to involve him in a fatal accident.<br />Shortly after David discovers that his uncle is cheating him out of the money and property he was supposed to inherit from his father, Ebenezer arranges for David to be kidnapped by a ship of ruffians and taken to the Carolinas to be sold into slavery.  While circling around Scotland, the ship runs into and wrecks another boat, and the crew captures the lone survivor, a rugged but vain Highlander named Alan Breck Stewart.  David quickly befriends Stewart, who turns out to be quite a swashbuckler, and they manage to subdue their captors and escape to the Scotland shore.  On the mainland, Stewart is accused of murdering a rival clan member who goes by the name of Red Fox; he and David must now cross the mountainous Scottish countryside to get to a safe haven, also permitting David to return to claim his inheritance.<br />This is a short but perfectly effective epic adventure that features everything such a story requires: crafty characters, excellent pacing, a keen sense of history (keep in mind it takes place over 130 years before it was written), and sharp dialogue that evokes the Scottish brogue and establishes the setting and tone.  With &quot;Kidnapped,&quot; Stevenson provides the 19th Century Scottish answer to Homer's Odyssey.	2001-06-25

London still exists, but it is now a part of Oceania, governed by an entity called the Party, headed by a sovereign figure known only as Big Brother.  The Party's one goal is power -- power over everybody and everything in Oceania.  Surveillance is administered constantly; devices called telescreens are placed in people's homes to monitor thoughts and actions and broadcast Party propaganda continuously, with no way for the resident to turn his off or change the channel.  Free thinkers are not tolerated, and roving bands of &quot;Thought Police&quot; are sent to sniff out transgressors.  The Party is developing an official language called Newspeak, whose goal is to simplify language by eliminating as many extraneous words as possible and reducing vocabulary to a small number of basic words, thus narrowing the scope of thought.<br />But there's always a rebel.  The protagonist is a man named Winston Smith who works at the Ministry of Truth as a sort of professional history revisionist.  His job is to revise newspaper articles and documents in which Big Brother made predictions or statements that did not agree with the actual outcome of events; in other words, to maintain the public illusion that the Party is infallible and omniscient.  Unhappy with his state of being, Winston would like to overthrow the Party but is powerless to do so.  Teaming up with his love interest Julia, another Party worker, he colludes with a high-ranking Party official named O'Brien, who reveals himself as a secret member of a society called the Brotherhood who are planning to destroy the Party.  O'Brien gives Winston a subversive book explaining the ideals and motivations of the Party: The upper classes (the highest Party members) need to retain their economic status, so it is important tocontrol the minds and bodies of the lower classes, and wars are waged constantly only so that capital will be spent on the production of war machinery instead of being converted into wealth which could be distributed to the lower classes.<br />Winston knows that if he is caught as a dissident, he's dead.  The Thought Police are everywhere, and can he trust Julia, O'Brien, and the friendly old shopkeeper Mr. Charrington to be who they say they really are?  Predictably, he is apprehended, but the Party's plans involve not killing but reprogramming him, which unfortunately for poor Winston could be a fate worse than death.<br />&quot;1984&quot; is not strictly an anti-communist rant.  (For that, see Arthur Koestler's &quot;Darkness at Noon.&quot;)  Rather, it attacks the complacency of all people and nations who would let a small number of idealists have their way and take command over the rest of the population.  Semantics aside, Communism and Fascism, as practiced by certain Twentieth Century world powers, are essentially the same thing: the individual loses all his importance for the benefit of the nation, which really means the ruling Party.  If democracy requires eternal vigilance, &quot;1984&quot; illustrates the consequences of apathy.	2001-06-18
US	49396726	R39SR5H63QLP78	0802132952	783763378	Naked Lunch	Books	4	9	9	N	N	The nightmare unfolds.	It would be easy to dismiss &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; as a junkie's incoherent nonsense, but, like most surrealism, there is an artistry and intelligence in it that must be acknowledged.  Like Herman Hesse's &quot;Steppenwolf,&quot; but going much farther beyond the bounds of literary convention, it is about a man's mental journey into the absurd, combining a cautionary tale, political satire, science fiction,  and science friction into a world shrouded in a narcotic haze.  <br />Burroughs's novel has no plot and no clearly defined characters.  It is a story narrated by a junk (opium and opium-derivative drugs, including heroin) addict who is sitting in a barren room somewhere, not having washed for months, needle in hand, searching desperately for a vein anywhere in his body that hasn't been worn out yet from repeated injections.  His trips take you to a place he calls Interzone, a multicultural panorama where deranged totalitarian political parties threaten to destroy each other, junkies and perverts writhe in festering filth, and violent orgies of sexual depravity, homoeroticism, pederasty, and scatology fill page after page in lurid detail.  It's like a travel guide to Sodom and Gomorrah.<br />I was completely absorbed by the book, even though there was much in it that I honestly didn't understand.  I enjoyed the colorful imagery and the frequent sentences of crystalline beauty (&quot;The subway sweeps by with a black blast of iron.&quot;), and I just let myself get swept along with the stream-of-consciousness flow of the words.  <br />The book is not anti-drugs, but it is anti-addiction and anti-sickness.  What Burroughs is emphasizing is control -- if you don't have knowledge about something, it will control you rather than you control it.  In the Appendix he writes frankly about the various drugs he's taken, their effects on his health, and their potential for addiction; and while he may not be the most credible scientific authority on the subject, his explanations are clear, concise, and helpful.  All this is much more effective and informative than any of Nancy Reagan's flimsy &quot;Just Say No&quot; cream puff propaganda of the 1980's.  &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; deserves praise for its honesty rather than criticism for its imagery.	2001-06-14

The central characters are Leander, the aging father, who is the captain of a boat that transports passengers between a leisure island and the mainland; his loving wife Sarah; his carefree, irresponsible sons Moses and Coverly; and his elderly, senile cousin Honora, who owns the boat and is in fact the family's financial anchor. <br />The novel's chain of events is set into motion one night when a car crashes into a tree near the Wapshots' house.  The driver is killed, but the passenger, a girl named Rosalie, is taken inside the Wapshots' house for convalescence.  It's not long before Moses and Rosalie take advantage of the intimacy of their living arrangement and engage in intercourse, unaware that Honora is eavesdropping.  Shocked by this display of debauchery, Honora vows to cut the family's financial ties loose unless Moses learns some responsibility and goes out into the world to make his own way.  And so he leaves St. Botolphs to go to Washington to get a job, and Coverly sneaks away from his parents to accompany him. <br />The two boys go their separate ways and each ends up married but in very different milieus with different sets of values.  Coverly marries a poor Southern girl, becomes a technician on a rocket-launching site, and takes up residence in a homogenized modern suburb.  His new life represents the modern (as of the 1950's), technical, practical, utilitarian world.  It is taken even further into classic Cheeveresque territory when Coverly considers a ... relationship after his wife abandons him.  <br />Cheever's proclivity for ironic romanticism is represented in Moses's new life, which is quite a contrast to his brother's.  After his prospects in Washington go sour, a chance encounter gives him a new opportunity as an aspiring banker.  With his new connections, like Jack climbing up the freshly-sprouted beanstalk of society, somehow he ends up in a sort of fairy-tale world.  He marries a beautiful princess named Melissa who is the ward of a wicked witch (the imperious harridan Justina Scaddon, heiress to a five-and-dime store fortune).  He and Melissa are imprisoned in the wicked witch's castle (Justina's ancient expansive mansion), staffed by a legion of harried servants and cohabited by Justina's companion, the foppishly ... Count D'Alba.  <br />Leander keeps a journal, a sort of combination autobiography/family history, in which his entries are written in a choppy style of sentence fragments, as though he doesn't have enough time to put subjects in his sentences, and he writes letters to his sons in the same style.  A problem of his own rears its ugly head in the form of a woman who claims to be his daughter from a previous marriage.  This is an interesting plot line that unfortunately is not developed as fully as it could have been.<br />I don't feel this novel is quite as great as Cheever's best short stories, but unlike his short stories, which generally tend to be depressing or somber, this novel has quite a bit of humor in it.  I found many symbols in the novel, the most important being that the father or head of a family is, in a way, like the captain of a ship, and no matter how hard he tries, sometimes he can't keep the ship from breaking up and sinking.  It is this sharp use of symbolism, the rhapsodic prose, the juxtaposition of the bizarre and the familiar that lends Cheever's work its considerable charm.	2001-06-11

Each main character is given focus for a chapter while the other characters fade into the background, then the next chapter will focus on another character in which the focal character of the previous chapter becomes a background character, etc.  Sherwood Anderson used a similar style of &quot;sketch&quot; writing in his &quot;Winesburg, Ohio,&quot; and the two novels share a theme of psychological and social isolation, but McCullers's novel is sharper, more vivid, detailed, and immediate, and evokes a keener sense of empathy in its characters.   <br />There is a popular cafe in town owned by a solicitous middle-aged man named Biff Brannon.  The cafe is frequented by a deaf-mute man named John Singer whose unsettling presence piques everyone's curiosity.  Singer befriends two ideologically aligned men, an alcoholic drifter named Jake Blount and a black doctor named Benedict Copeland.  Blount and Copeland both happen to be radical Marxists; Blount denounces capitalism and the exploitation of workers, while Copeland exhorts his people to become self-sufficient and dignified.  When Blount and Copeland finally meet and speak face to face, they agree on the problem but cannot agree on the solution.<br />And then there's the young teenage girl Mick Kelly, a tomboy who has little interest in acting ladylike and emulating her older sisters, and whose family runs a boarding house in which Singer rents a room.  She is at the age when her life is in several states of transition -- physical maturation, artistic revelation (via Beethoven's Third Symphony, no less), sexual awakening, and the initial responsibilities of adulthood.  It is remarkable how her character is so innocent yet at the same time so complex and worldly -- like a female Tom Sawyer, she blazes her own trail through society and is ready for anything. <br />These people hover around Singer like satellites and use him as a sounding board for their problems while he listens attentively and offers symphathy.  Why they are drawn to Singer is no mystery -- it is said that a good conversationalist is one who listens well rather than talks.  Singer has his own problem -- loneliness for the absence of his institutionalized friend, another deaf-mute, the only kind of person who can relate to him. <br />The novel illustrates that underneath the idyllic calm of traditional Southern gentility bubbles a cauldron of racial tension and imminent violence, symbolically fueled by the heat and humidity and swampy gloom.  Towards the end of the novel there is an incident involving a riot at the fair where Blount works; in the way the local newspaper covers the story, McCullers offers a subtle ironic statement about how the country (the South in particular) is concerned more with the threat of Communism than with racial discord.  And she was only 23 when she wrote this?  Amazing.	2001-06-06

The protagonist, Ernest Pontifex, is the oldest of three children of the rector of a small English town.  His father, Theobald, beats and browbeats his children into learning their hymns while his mother, Christina, solemnly and unsympathetically condones the excessive discipline.      Ernest is not much of a scholar and shows a predilection for music (nothing more modern than Handel, though), which his father deems a decadent waste of time.  For lack of a better calling, he chooses to become a clergyman like his father and is ordained a deacon after completing Cambridge.  As a young man, he runs into some misfortune: He gets suckered into giving much of his money to a smooth-talking charlatan named Pryer, a fellow theologian, to invest, and a turbulent encounter with a prostitute lands him a few months in jail.  It is here that he decides a religious path is not for him, which is just as well since he is more of a pragmatist than a dogmatist.  He becomes a tailor, but his business fails; he gets married, but his wife turns out to be a lush and a bigamist.  If this indeed bears any resemblance to Butler's own life, I shake my head in pity.        The narrator is not Ernest himself but his godfather Edward Overton, a close friend of the Pontifex family.  Butler probably thought such third-party commentary would provide a more valuable perspective, but it doesn't ring true for Overton to be privy to every single detail of Ernest's life which would not be so easily discovered or revealed.  However, Butler is a good writer who peppers his prose with sly sarcasm and humorous observations to counteract its Victorian-style stodginess.    For a novel that has a reputation of deconstructing and satirizing the piety of Victorian society, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" feels innocuous and tame; what could have been a fiery tirade against religious hypocrisy comes off more as a gentle prodding.  For a satire to be successful, the target must be odious and obvious; the book's tone is too dull and soft to inspire the reader to hate the Pontifex family and the religious furor they represent.  I respect Butler's motivation for writing this book and I wanted to symphathize with him, but I got nothing more out of it than a recounting of the irrelevant misadventures of an average man from an average middle class family.	2001-06-04

It is a study in cause and effect -- how a character's environment, or change of environment, affects his or her values, especially with regard to money and the iniquity it brings.  <br />18-year-old Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; Meeber, bored with her life in a small Wisconsin town, comes to Chicago in 1889 to live with her sister Minnie.  The only employment she can get is a laborious, low-paying job in a shoe factory, and when she loses it and wears out her welcome with her sister's family, a well-to-do young man named Charles Drouet, whom she met on the train to Chicago, sets her up in an apartment where they pretend to be married.  <br />Drouet has a friend named George Hurstwood, a man in his late thirties and the manager at a local upscale bar.  Hurstwood's home life is stagnant and empty; he has a self-centered wife whom he ceased loving long ago and two materialistic children around Carrie's age.  He is going through what many decades later would be called a midlife crisis.<br />Through Drouet, Hurstwood meets Carrie and they form a mutual attraction.  Unlike Drouet, to whom life is all about social status, Hurstwood does not patronize Carrie; he makes her feel intelligent and important, and Carrie exhibits Hurstwood's ideals of youth and beauty.  When Hurstwood's wife gets wise to her husband's affair and sues him for divorce,  Hurstwood succumbs to the temptation to steal money from his employer and tricks Carrie into leaving Chicago with him.  They go to New York and experience curious reversals of fortune -- Carrie becomes a rich and famous showgirl while Hurstwood drifts into inescapable poverty and a bitter end.<br />This is no Cinderella story for Carrie.  It may seem like she is being rewarded for her innocence and integrity, but since she realizes that her success is more the result of luck than talent, her new life is not as fulfilling as she thought it might be.  I found myself surprisingly engaged by the story because Dreiser presents his characters as real people with unsolvable problems and doesn't try to teach a morality lesson.  I finished the novel feeling miserable about the world, which is not something that many novels can do to me.  My only complaint is that Dreiser's prose is a little awkward and excessively wordy without the benefit of clarity; it longs for the smoother touch of D.H. Lawrence or Somerset Maugham.	2001-05-29

Inspired by his own experience as a foreign correspondent, Evelyn Waugh's &quot;Scoop&quot; is partly a satire of journalism, partly a spy story with a well-crafted plot, and totally a masterpiece of comic writing.<br />Civil war is brewing in a fictitious African country called Ishmaelia.  In England, a successful novelist named John Courteney Boot would like to be sent there as a foreign correspondent/spy, so he gets a friend to pull some strings with the owner of a London newspaper called the Beast, a paper which &quot;stands for strong mutually antagonistic governments everywhere.&quot;  The paper's owner, Lord Copper, has never heard of Boot, but accedes to the request and has his Foreign Editor, Mr. Salter, set up the engagement.  Salter mistakenly taps John's less famous, less talented cousin William Boot, who writes a dippy nature column for the Beast, to be the foreign correspondent in Ishmaelia.  So off William goes, a large assortment of emergency equipment for the tropics in tow, including a collapsible canoe.<br />When William gets to Ishmaelia, he encounters several journalists from newspapers all over the world who also are looking for the big scoop on the war.  The problem is that nobody knows what's going on, as there is no palpable unrest, and the country's government is an institution of buffoonery.  The events in Ishmaelia are reminiscent of the circus-like atmosphere of Joseph Heller's &quot;Catch-22.&quot;  While the rest of the journalists take off to the country's interior on a red herring, William stays behind in the capital and meets a man who is at the center of the country's political intrigue and lets William in on exclusive information.  William manages to turn in the big story and becomes a journalistichero back in England.<br />Lovers of good prose will find much to savor in &quot;Scoop&quot;; practically every sentence is a gem of dry British wit.  Waugh is comparable with P.G. Wodehouse in his flair for comic invention, and indeed William Boot is a protagonist worthy of Wodehouse -- a hapless but likeable dim bulb who triumphs through dumb luck.	2001-05-21

It is tightly plotted and features a wide assortment of interesting and eccentric characters, but it is also somewhat dissonant and disturbing in the way it makes a crude, if well-meaning, statement about economic reform.    <br />Clive Benson is a 63-year-old author who has had a semi-successful career writing historical novels, but now, stuck with writer's block while working on a novel about the Liverpool slave trade, makes money as a literary consultant for a group of aspiring writers he calls the &quot;Fictioneers.&quot;  His students include a grammatically challenged science fiction enthusiast, a rebellious biker girl writing lurid poetry, a quiet young man struggling to find a starting point for his autobiographical novel, and a woman writing a campy period romance.   <br />Always looking for symbols in mundane events, Benson collects tabloid photographs and articles and wanders the streets of Liverpool striking up conversations with strangers.  One person he comes across is an old World War II army buddy named Thompson, now a homeless bum, who sparks in Benson a memory of a personal tragedy in his past.  Seeking answers about this incident, Benson tracks down his former platoon commander, Slater, who now is a wealthy financier married to a movie star and living in a country manor that happens to have been built by one of the Liverpool slave traders.  Benson finds that Slater is essentially the same kind of domineering windbag he was in the army, nationalistically proud of England's history and aristocracy.<br />One of Benson's friends, a liberal, anti-Thatcher, activistic history professor named Alma Corrigan, inspires him to launch a juvenile revenge scheme against Slater, involving some of his impressionable and impulsive Fictioneers.  The absurd denouement, however, is unsatisfactory for a novel like this that is attempting to make a serious political statement.  The result of Benson's threadbare scheme does not change anything about British society or politics, does not strengthen the statement about economic reform that was already made clear throughout the novel, and is not even funny if that was its intention.  The novel does not make it clear why a man of Benson's age, maturity, and relatively mild disposition would want to put such a plan into action; maybe his problem is that he can't tell where fiction stops and reality begins.  <br />Despite the incongruous ending, I must admit that reading this novel was a pleasure because of Unsworth's richly descriptive prose and characterization.  Unsworth has a keen sense for creating extraordinary characters with comical but believable idiosyncracies.  The chauffeur who claims to be John Lennon's former bodyguard, the romance writer who indignantly refuses to have her stuffy characters impaled on spikes, the Verdi-loving Mrs. Slater who is in a constant alchoholic haze, and Rathbone the performing hypnotist are some of the best characters a reader could hope for.  If only the book had an ending worthy of them...	2001-05-18
US	49396726	R30IT7BUASHD0	0684801469	11530247	A Farewell To Arms	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Love and war	Hemingway's &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is about a love affair between a man and a woman, and a love affair between a man and a war.  Only someone like Hemingway would be able to find the right notes to combine these two contrasting themes in a sort of literary harmony, where each complements and augments the emotional force of the other, without resorting to contrived romantic overkill.<br />The novel takes place in the last years of World War I, in which an American named Frederick Henry is serving as an ambulance driver in the Italian army.  He meets and falls in love with an English nurse named Catherine Barkley; after he is badly injured in a mortar shell attack, he and Catherine consummate their love while he convalesces in a hospital in Milan.  Using his trademark sharp dialogue, Hemingway shows how the presence of war in Henry's and Catherine's lives intensifies the rapid development of their relationship.<br />When a crabby hospital superintendent suspects Henry is idly prolonging his convalescence, she gets him sent back to his ambulance post at the front.  On his way to a battle ground to pick up wounded, he is arrested by Italian battle police who hear his foreign accent and think he is a German soldier disguised in an Italian uniform.  He manages a daring escape and goes to a town where he finds Catherine again.  When he is alerted that the Italian army is looking to arrest him for desertion, he realizes his only option is to escape to Switzerland under cover of night.<br />The notion I get about Hemingway's writing of war is that, to him, it's a sport, a big game, that accepts physical suffering as a fair price to pay for the camaraderie and adventure; a game in which victories are celebrated with a lot of drinking, and losses are mourned with...a lot of drinking.  This is not a criticism, just an observation; he writes with so much spirit and conviction on the subject of war that it's difficult to find fault with his style.  This is exemplified most in Henry's decision at the end of the novel:  At just a time when his life seems to be falling apart, he realizes he must &quot;get back&quot; to the war, not because he likes war, but because it gives him a will to live; it's in his blood as much as it sheds his blood.	2001-05-14

As time goes by, one year brings drought and famine and Wang Lung moves his family to a distant city to find better opportunities.  He gets a job pulling a rickshaw while O-lan and the children beg in the streets and even once resort to stealing meat from a butcher, which offends Wang Lung's sense of honesty.  An interesting scene develops when he encounters a white Christian missionary who gives him, without explanation, a picture of the Crucifixion, an image that puzzles and horrifies him.  During a peasant revolt against a wealthy house, he and O-lan acquire some money with which they are able to return to their own land and buy even more.<br />With agricultural conditions now more favorable, Wang Lung builds his farm into a profitable business with time and hard work, and he can afford now to send his two oldest sons to a school for the education that he had never had for himself.  As his wealth increases, his house becomes a small dynasty of extended family, including his troublesome uncle and cousin, and numerous servants and concubines, including a prostitute named Lotus whom he &quot;bought&quot; when his newfound prosperity presented him with too much spare time in which he grew bored with O-lan.  At the end of his life, Wang Lung realizes that, despite the vast riches he has amassed, he has never shed the soul of a farmer and an almost religious relationship with the soil, one which his materialistic sons do not share.<br />Implied in the novel's title, and illustrated in Wang Lung's dramatic reversal of fortune, is that the welfare of these farmers depends almost solely on the bounty of the earth and the mercy of nature.  In fact, the story is a little too simplistic.  It feels like a fable, containing simple lessons about hard work, kindness, pride, greed, and other basic human traits, written in stiff, mechanical prose that seems intended for young or naive readers.  It contains the kind of sentimentality and melodrama that seems appropriate for a silent movie.  Most curiously, it is not as thoroughly descriptive of Chinese culture, society, and geography as, say, Rudyard Kipling's writing about India or Paul Bowles's writing about northern Africa, but I suspect that Buck's other books about China provide more extensive detail.

Wayward wives seems to be the theme of Raymond Chandler's fourth Philip Marlowe novel, &quot;The Lady in the Lake.&quot;  A man named Derace Kingsley hires Marlowe to find his missing wife Crystal, who has run away with a playboy named Chris Lavery.  The problem is that Lavery is back in Los Angeles and claims he doesn't know where Crystal is.  Then Marlowe finds out about the apparent suicide of the wife of a doctor that Crystal had been seeing.  Searching for clues in Kingsley's cabin in the mountains outside San Bernardino, Marlowe meets Bill Chess, the caretaker of the cabin, who lamentably tells Marlowe that his own wife had left him recently.  Shortly thereafter, Marlowe and Chess find the corpse of a woman drowned in a lake near Kingsley's cabin.  <br />To reveal any more information would not so much spoil any surprises as it would be a maddening exercise in convoluted logic.  The plot is so highly complicated, in fact, that Chandler seems to have attempted to outdo even the novel's three predecessors (&quot;The High Window&quot; and the seminal classics &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; and &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;).  As usual, his character development and use of dialogue and action are peerless, and of course he is the master of employing characters with disguised or multiple identities.  And perhaps most importantly, he knows how to disclose information to the reader at just the right pace to maintain the proper amount of tension -- never stretched so much that all credibility goes out the window nor so little that the story becomes dull.	2001-05-07

By that, I mean Woolf's writing has a dreamlike, impressionistic quality that uses little dialogue.  The novel is about several English people who spend their summers in the Hebrides, islands northwest of Scotland.  The lighthouse mentioned in the title is located on one of the islands and symbolizes a goal or an ideal to which several of the characters aspire in one way or another.<br />The most prominent characters are the Ramsay family, whose internal conflicts form the basis for their existence, much like any other nuclear family.  Mr. Ramsay is a philosophy professor, an imperious man who dreams of being remembered for his work and enjoys laying down the law with his children.  Mrs. Ramsay's love for her husband has dwindled to the point of her not being sure why she ever fell in love with him in the first place, but she is enamored with the *idea* of being in love, always looking forward to her single friends getting married. <br />The central character, however, is a woman named Lily Briscoe who paints canvases of an apparently abstract nature.  Her conflict appears in the form of a character named Charles Tansley, an unsociable chauvinist who admonishes her that &quot;women can't paint, women can't write.&quot;  Lily Briscoe's efforts to paint represent the difficult, introspective process of artistic creation.  <br />In combining the themes represented by Lily and the Ramsays, Woolf portrays the problems of being a woman artist in a society that discouraged women to be artistic or creative (the discouragement represented by the voice of Tansley) and therefore having to deal with the disappointment and frustration of conflicting with social mores (illustrated by Mrs. Ramsay's discontent in her marriage).  However, Lily triumphs in completing her painting at the end, as Woolf triumphs in completing her novel.	2001-04-30

Written in a loose, informal style, it is a fast, fun, yet compelling read.<br />The Bas-Thorntons are an English family living on an estate in Jamaica some time in the late 19th Century.  They have five children ranging in age from about twelve to three.  When their house is demolished in a hurricane, the parents decide to send the kids back to England to spare them from future potential danger and emotional trauma.<br />The kids sail back to England on a small ship called the Clorinda, accompanied by two friends whose parents also are staying in Jamaica.  Soon the Clorinda is overtaken by a schooner bearing pirates, who rob it of its cargo and kidnap the children.  It is not the pirates' intention to detain the children for long, but the captain of the Clorinda, believing that the pirates have murdered the kids, escapes the encounter and notifies the Bas-Thornton parents of the unfortunate incident.<br />The pirates, as the children soon discover, are not very menacing and not very competent in the moribund business of piracy.  They stop at a coastal village in Cuba and try to auction off all the cargo from the Clorinda but meet with indifference from the villagers.  Failing to slough the kids off on the village's Chief Magistrate, the pirates resume cruising around the Caribbean with a cargo of unwanted brats.  As the kids eventually adopt the schooner as their new playground, the pirates' captain begins to take on a role akin to a hapless school bus driver, a fortuitous babysitter and awkward disciplinarian.  Meanwhile, the kids fantasize about becoming pirates themselves and taking over the ship someday.<br />Two important events in the story involve the deaths of two characters, one by accident and the other by murder.  Neither is directly the pirates' fault, but they must stand trial for the crimes when they are betrayed by the children after their &quot;rescue.&quot; <br />From reading this plot summary, you can tell that this book is bursting at the seams with irony.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it could be compared to William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (which it predates) and O. Henry's &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot; (which it doesn't), but it avoids the serious sociopolitical implications of the former and the shallow slapstick of the latter, ultimately finding an original niche somewhere between the two.	2001-04-27

The novel, his &quot;complaint,&quot; is written in the form of an address to his psychiatrist, Dr. Spielvogel.  Portnoy is trying desperately to understand how his relationship with his parents has influenced his dysfunctional relationships with women.  <br />Portnoy's parents have always been worried about him in ways that seem ridiculous to him.  His mother tells him never to eat lobster because it might make him sick like it once did to her.  When he feigns diarrhea so he can lock himself in the bathroom to masturbate, his mother chides him for purposely sabotaging his digestion by eating french fries after school.  (A large portion of this book is devoted to hilarious tales of his uncontrollable onanistic urges and discharges -- into the toilet bowl, onto the light bulbs, onto the medicine chest mirror, on the bus, into the liver his mother is going to cook for dinner, once even accidentally into his own eye.)  When he goes to college, they make him promise them he won't ride in a convertible.  When he plans to go on a month-long vacation to Europe, his aged father lays a guilt trip on him about what he would do if he came home to find his father dead.<br />It isn't good enough for Portnoy's parents that their son has become a prominent lawyer and civil libertarian; they want him to get married and have children.  Rebelling against his parents, he starts a string of sexually adventurous but loveless affairs with shikses (non-Jewish girls) whom he gives unflattering pet names.  In college, there was &quot;The Pumpkin,&quot; a bright, wholesome, conscientious girl; then there was &quot;The Pilgrim,&quot; a WASPy debutante; and most recently, there was &quot;The Monkey,&quot; a beautiful ex-model but a practically illiterate hayseed.  Visiting Israel after abandoning The Monkey on vacation in Greece, his sexual problems come full circle when hemeets a Jewish girl who reminds him of his mother.<br />This book is not for everybody.  It is often very funny, but some may feel its tone is too paranoid, bitter, cynical, and confused.  The narration frequently degenerates into empty invective (a lot of personal self-loathing, Jewish self-loathing, mocking of Catholic and WASP stereotypes), but at least it doesn't euphemize or sugarcoat its delivery.  For better or worse, &quot;Portnoy's Complaint&quot; is as honest and accurate a piece of Twentieth Century American Jewish folklore as there is.	2001-04-18

A literary cornucopia that combines whimsical fantasy with brutal reality, it contains so many details and events to recount that it defies a succinct plot summary; each chapter is episodic, with its own distinct plot line.<br />The narration is told by 30-year-old Oskar Matzerath, who is a patient in a mental hospital in Dusseldorf.  He was born in 1924 in a suburb of the Baltic seaport of Danzig (currently Gdansk, Poland).  On his third birthday, the day he receives his first toy tin drum, he stunts his growth by throwing himself down a flight of stairs.  Feigning mental retardation, he beats on his drum as a means of communication and expression and shatters glass with a piercing scream as a means of rebellion.<br />As Oskar ages, he witnesses the course of Danzig's history during the Nazi invasion, including Kristallnacht and the Polish resistance, and throughout World War II.  Most of his tales, however, concern the private lives of his family and acquaintances.  He is a dwarven Augie March, interacting with all strata of society and offering commentary on the absurdity of his environment.  He joins an entertainment troupe of midgets during the war (resulting in a rather strange chapter containing a bit of surrealist drama), becomes the leader (and Jesus) of a group of juvenile delinquents, moves to Dusseldorf after the war and becomes a tombstone engraver, an artists' model, and a drummer in a jazz band that performs in a sort of grief clinic.  And that's only a small and superficial sample of Oskar's life experiences.<br />What is interesting about &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; is that it acknowledges but is not obsessed with the atrocities of the Nazis; Grass puts human faces on the German and Polish lives that personified the tumultuously battle-scarred nations and uses the deformed Oskar as a metaphor for their blackened history.  Years later Salman Rushdie was to write a very similar, and similarly excellent, book about India called &quot;Midnight's Children,&quot; and I can't help but suspect that Rushdie used &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; as a model.Oskar as a metaphor for their blackened history.

It's 1979, and Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom is now part-owner and chief salesman of his deceased father-in-law's Toyota dealership; smaller Japanese imports promise greater fuel efficiency in these times of gas shortage and skyrocketing inflation.  With their finances finally solvent and their marriage somewhat stable, Rabbit and his wife Janice have joined a country club for the affluent middle class and have a new circle of friends.  In true lecherous Rabbit style, he fantasizes about the wife of one of his friends, in one of the novel's three major plot threads.  On a group vacation to a Carribean island, he barely misses out on realizing his fantasy in a spouse-swapping episode described in rich, erotic detail, an Updike forte.   <br />The second plot thread concerns Rabbit's son Nelson, who has been dawdling away his college years and comes home with a surprise: He has gotten a girl named Pru (short for &quot;prudish&quot;) pregnant and intends to drop out of college and marry her.  Rabbit reluctantly agrees to give Nelson a sales job at the dealership to appease Janice and her mother.  While Rabbit has accumulated some wisdom and levelheadedness in his middle age, Nelson, in his young adulthood, has taken on some of Rabbit's judgmental and censorious attitude toward people, and his impulsive business decisions hurt the dealership's profits.  Like his father long ago, Nelson has a tendency to run away when encroached upon by life's pressures.   <br />  The third plot thread concerns a girl who innocently visits the dealership one day.  She reminds Rabbit of somebody...He realizes she could be the illegitimate daughter he fathered twenty years ago in his fling with a woman named Ruth.  He needs to confront Ruth to achieve closure over this missing piece in his life's puzzle but is unable to work up the nerve.<br />&quot;Rabbit Is Rich&quot; is not as turbulent as its predecessor, &quot;Rabbit Redux,&quot; but that could be because 1979 was not as interesting as 1969.  I see these novels as chronicles of the American zeitgeist, starring an Everyman to whom everybody can relate in some way or another, like him or not.  Updike is one of our great contemporary wordsmiths, turning everyday sights and sounds into majestic literary canvases.  His ability to describe the most mundane things in life -- a plane taking off, a crumpled car fender, a head of hair, the actions of a dog, the forced solemnity of a wedding ceremony -- with incredible perceptivity and poeticality makes you look at things you normally take for granted in a completely different light.	2001-04-06
US	49396726	RDYHX86SM97KA	0679723420	755867934	Pale Fire	Books	5	10	11	N	N	A fictional literary critique that entertains on many levels	This novel is a brilliantly conceived profile of two humorous literary characters, one whom we never meet but know only through a 999-line poem called &quot;Pale Fire&quot; he composed in the last twenty days of his life, and the other his unwelcome colleague, an eccentric man with delusions of grandeur and persecution mania, who annotates the poem.  Although the novel consists of only the poem and the commentary, rest assured there is a plot, but its development is quite unconventional.<br />The poet is a reclusive college professor named John Shade, and his colleague is another professor named Charles Kinbote, who comes from a fictitious northern European country called Zembla.  Kinbote, long an admirer of Shade's work, had rented a house adjacent to Shade's five months prior to Shade's death.  Kinbote has a voyeuristic obsession with Shade, spying on his house with binoculars and prying into his work.  Convinced that he and Shade had some kind of exclusive rapport during Shade's final months, Kinbote believes that much of the text of &quot;Pale Fire&quot; refers to information he had disclosed to Shade about recent political events in Zembla, when it is obvious that Shade's poem is strictly personal, expounding on important times in his life: his childhood, his courtship with his wife, the death of his daughter, his heart attack.  <br />The &quot;narration&quot; of the novel takes place a few months after Shade's death, with Kinbote living in a motel room disturbed by noisy neighbors and writing his commentary about the poem.  His commentary tends to go off on comical tangents about the political intrigue in Zembla.  We learn that the last King of Zembla was imprisoned in his palace during a quasi-Bolshevik Revolution but managed to escape via a secret passage and travel incognito to America, where he was given a new identity.  After the escape, the King was stalked by a heavily aliased assassin who resourcefully discovered his quarry's whereabouts, resulting ina confrontation whose outcome did not go exactly as planned.  <br />The plot construction is diabolically clever in the way Nabokov reveals information little by little throughout Kinbote's commentary; you may have to read the book twice to see which details you missed the first time, but Nabokov's prose is so colorful and ebullient that doing so is a pleasure.  Even more interesting is the doubt established by Nabokov as to whether Kinbote's revelations are reality or delusions; his sanity is questionable.  Every now and then I come across a book that's so wildly creative and so much fun that it reminds me why I love to read -- &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is easily one of those books.	2001-03-30

Port and Kit's marriage is shaky, made more so by the sly presence of Tunner, who has his eye on Kit.  (This love triangle is vaguely redolent of the trio of safari hunters in Hemingway's &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.&quot;)  These three widely-traveled Americans are so bored with the refinement of their lives back home and the predictability of more popular tourist attractions that they feel an itinerary through the exotic, if often filthy and diseased, land of the Sahara will provide an exhilarating change of pace.  What they find is that they cannot escape their own personal demons.  <br />The novel begins in Oran, Algeria, from which the trio plan to travel more or less aimlessly from city to city throughout northern Africa, by bus or train, seeing the sights and staying in the hotels.  At a hotel bar, Port meets an odd and sneaky young English man named Eric Lyle who is traveling with his querulous, overbearing mother.  As the Moresbys and Tunner arrive in different towns, the Lyles have a tendency to turn up again like a bad penny without much purpose to the plot or effect on the main characters.  The Lyles offer a lot of interesting plot potential which Bowles unfortunately does not bother to explore.  <br />I was puzzled by the last third of the novel, which seems strangely detached from the preceding events.  Port eventually comes down with a fever and dies, and Kit inexplicably runs off into the desert.  She gets picked up by two native merchants traveling by camel, and continuing southward through the desert, they ravish her on a regular basis, which she does not entirely resist.  One of the merchants takes her to his home and holds her captive in his harem.  This descent into a symbolic hell seems to signal the end of her carefree life of innocence and luxury, a life to which she can no longer return. <br />The book is beautifully written; Bowles depicts the Sahara's geography, people, and cultures with the kind of rich detail such a story deserves.  I just wish Kit's motives at the end of the novel were a little more comprehensible.	2001-03-26
US	49396726	R1NBLTPC93XB9K	0486280500	247841222	A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Getting to know Joyce	&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; is an autobiographical novel covering the first twenty or so years of James Joyce's life, and as the title implies, it is about his awakening to the desire to become an artist.  Joyce writes in the third person as Stephen Dedalus, the oldest child in a large family with a father who is prosperous but unfocused at making a living.  <br />The novel begins with Stephen's earliest memories of his parents telling him silly stories as a baby.  Then the narration cuts quickly to his years at a Jesuit boarding school where he finds that he is extraordinarily conscientious and sensitive to his tangible surroundings: colors, objects, and words.  The priests who teach at the school are rigid taskmasters and disciplinarians, and Joyce vividly depicts the (undeserved) punishment Stephen must endure when he is caught idle at his lessons.<br />The rigorous religious atmosphere of the Jesuit schools is stifling to Stephen's developing aesthetic sensibilities.  At the day school where he spends his early teenage years, the priests fill the students' heads with terrifying (and ridiculous) visions of hell, and Stephen endeavors to become more devout, dispel impure thoughts, and save himself from an eternity of torment in a lake of fire.<br />Stephen's religious devotion impresses the priests at his school so much that they recommend he consider joining the order.  He consents to this idea at first, but one day he has an epiphany: watching birds in the sky, he realizes an incredible freedom that is available to him -- a freedom of creation, invention, symbolized by his namesake in Greek mythology.  He skips the priesthood and attends a university where he becomes an intellectual, pontificating on the meaning of art and beauty and writing sorrowful poetry about a girl who is the object of his desire.<br />Contrary to the reputation that &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; have, &quot;A Portrait...&quot; is really not difficult to read, nor is it without humor.  The narration is straightforward, and it presents the process of becoming a self-aware artist with surprising clarity, poignancy, and realism.	2001-03-19

Prayer is outlawed, worshippers are incarcerated, churches have fallen into disuse, and priests are being hunted down and murdered.  &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; is the story of one of the remaining priests who is running for his life and fighting to survive in the hostile environment that was once his parish.  There's a price on his head: The lieutenant knows he's out there and is gunning for him.<br />The priest is not given a name.  He is a self-admitted bad priest who has an illegitimate daughter, likes to drink (hence he is called a &quot;whisky priest&quot;), and puts his own interests ahead of the needs of others.  When the lieutenant's &quot;Red Shirts&quot; invade villages in which they think the priest has stayed and take hostages when the villagers withhold information on his whereabouts, the priest could give himself up to save these people, but his selfish pride refuses to allow him to suffer the humiliation of surrendering to the Red Shirts.  Despite his transgressions, the poor people he encounters in the villages value his presence and expect him to carry out the duties of his office such as performing Mass and hearing confessions.  <br />The priest is trying to escape to a neighboring &quot;safe&quot; state, and along the way he meets a symbolically serpentine two-toothed mestizo (half-caste Mexican) who suspects the priest's identity and is tempted to turn him in for the reward money.  Greene plots this novel with a traditional conflict and resolution, so it's inevitable that the priest has a final confrontation with the lieutenant, in which each man eloquently defends his position.  <br />There is a parallel between the events portrayed in this novel and the persecution of the early Christians by the ancient Romans, and therein lies a simple but powerful message: that freedom of religion is a basic human right that should extend beyond geographical and political boundaries.	2001-03-19

It takes place in a town called Gibbsville (actually O'Hara's hometown of Pottsville), located on the edge of the coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania, during the Christmas weekend of 1930.  <br />Julian English, president of the local Cadillac dealership, and his wife Caroline are among the town's leading young socialites, with a large circle of influential and prosperous friends.  During a fateful forty-eight hours over this festive weekend of excessive drinking, Julian makes three foolish mistakes which send him spiraling to his destruction.  At a Christmas Eve party, he becomes irritated by the longwinded Harry Reilly and throws a drink in his face.  The assembled throng is shocked; Reilly is not only one of the town's wealthiest citizens, but also happens to own Julian's dealership.  The next night, at another party with his wife in attendance, Julian again causes a stir by making a move on the girlfriend of a local mobster.  He makes his third mistake at lunch the next day when he gets into a fight with Caroline's cousin over the previous night's transgression.  Combined with the stress of meeting his financial responsibilities at the dealership, he can feel the walls quickly closing in, and there is only one way out.  <br />Julian is an overgrown frat boy.  He has the best of everything in his life -- a beautiful wife, a good job, popularity, a good education -- but he is tragically compelled to do all the wrong things and burn his bridges, possibly due to an underlying sense of low self-esteem and shame.  Reading this novel is like watching an impending car accident -- you can't resist observing the impact, even though you know it's going to be brutal.	2001-03-12

Jones portrays the Army as a system in which enlisted men are like pawns in a political chess game played by the officers.  The everyday drudgery of Army life contrasts sharply with the promise of high adventure advertised by the recruiting posters.  A common peacetime practice is rewarding soldiers for athletic prowess that has little to do with their military training, and boxing is a popular pastime.  <br />Private Robert E. Lee &quot;Prew&quot; Prewitt, having grown up dirt poor in eastern Kentucky and spent much of his adolescence as a vagrant, does not have many options in life and serves in the Infantry with the intention of being a career soldier.  When the novel begins, he has just transferred into G Company where, much to the chagrin of his superior officers First Sergeant Milton Warden and company commander Captain Holmes, he is unwilling to join the boxing team despite the fact that he is a champion welterweight.  His superiors try to break him by putting him through systematic psychological intimidation they call &quot;The Treatment.&quot;  Prew is wise to their motives, but accepts it with cynical indifference.  <br />Meanwhile, Warden is having a clandestine affair with Holmes's wife Karen, whose promiscuity is a rebellion against her imposed domestic lifestyle as an Army wife.  Prew also has a love interest, a prostitute named Lorene, who provides sanctuary when he gets into trouble.<br />The climactic incident of Prew's &quot;treatment&quot; occurs when he gets in a scuffle with a sergeant named Old Ike (who, oddly enough, talks like Yoda).  Prew is sentenced to the Stockade, where he must endure swinging a sledgehammer on a rockpile, solitary confinement in the &quot;Hole&quot;, and sadistic guards who wield a reign of terror through physical abuse.  When one of the guards beats an inmate to death, Prew vows revenge, and making good on it is yet another step in his downward spiral.  And here I think it's worth mentioning that Jones writes some of the best fight scenes ever.  <br />What I liked most about &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; is that, for a military novel, it avoids formulas of jingoism and contrived heroism in order to tell realistic stories about soldiers who are not necessarily honorably dedicated to fighting for their country, and are doing so more out of being in the wrong place at the wrong time than out of patriotism.  This is reflected in Prew, who lives for the Army and ultimately is destroyed by it in more ways than one, and the several other disparate characters Jones introduces to emphasize the Army's internal conflicts.  And the most indelible memory this novel leaves me is Jones's succinct and brilliant description of a suicide victim's final thoughts in the split second after pulling the trigger of the rifle lodged in his mouth.	2001-02-28

He is so depraved, so immoral, so belligerent, and has so little regard his family, for humanity, and for himself, that this novel can only be understood within the realm of the comically absurd.  <br />Dangerfield is an Irish American living in Dublin with his long-suffering wife and baby daughter, both of whom he physically assaults when he is irked.  He is supposed to be studying law at Trinity College, but accomplishes very little of it what with all his drinking, loafing, extramarital affairs, and general womanizing.  He hangs around with several loser friends, one of whom is another American transplant named O'Keefe who is so unlucky with women that he retreats to Paris to dabble in homosexuality and pederasty, and then returns to Ireland to try to lie his way into a job as a chef.  Much of the narration is an erratic mix of sentence fragments and complete sentences that alternate freely between first and third person and present and past tense, echoing Dangerfield's cluttered, harried, and often drunken thoughts. <br />So why read a book about such a moron as Dangerfield?  Because he has a unique perspective on his life and his surroundings, there is depth to his thoughts, there is spice in his speech; his commentary on Ireland, its people, and Irish-English antipathy (&quot;Jesus was a mick and Judas was a lime&quot;) is interesting if not enlightening.  What makes this novel succeed as an unlikely comic work is that Donleavy writes with an ironic levity that suggests Dangerfield is more to be pitied than censured, even during his cruelest moments.  The world would be a kinder, gentler place without its Sebastian Dangerfields, but it would also be more boring.  And somebody has to wear the kangaroo costume.	2001-02-20

Most of the stories are told from the vista of the recurring central character George Willard, the local newspaper reporter and a sort of alter ego of Anderson, who used his own rural hometown of Clyde, Ohio, as a model for Winesburg.<br />Rather than an idyllic portrayal of American small town life in the 1890's, these stories are about psychological isolation, loneliness, and sexual repression and frustration brought about by small town mores.  These people are as sad and neurotic as any that might be found living in the big cities.  Anderson calls them &quot;grotesques,&quot; people who are warped by the sanctimoniousness of provincial piety and their own inhibitions.  His nonchalant, ironic way of writing understates the peculiarity and the gloominess of the stories.  <br />The stories are loaded with symbolism that is difficult to decipher.  My favorite is probably the four-part &quot;Godliness&quot;, which, in a satire of religious fervor, merges parodies of the biblical tales of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac and David's slaying of Goliath.  But all the stories have interesting allusions of various degrees of subtlety.  This work must have seemed quite groundbreaking in its depth, complexity, and boldness when it was first published in 1919.	2001-02-12

But whereas Wodehouse wrote about silly characters worming their way out of silly situations with silly dialogue and behavior, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; presents a scenario in which humor is developed more subtly through natural irony, cynical sarcasm, and things that are implied rather than said.<br />The protagonist, Jim Dixon, is a lecturer in the history department of a not-so-highly acclaimed British university.  He is lazy, immature, and hates his job and his boss, Professor Welch, the head of the department.  Jim feels obligated to attend Welch's boring weekend parties, singing corny madrigals with insufferable members of the university faculty.  At one of these parties, Jim runs afoul of Welch's son Bertrand, a pompous, self-important painter and self-declared pacifist who threatens Jim with bodily harm when piqued.  <br />Jim falls in love with Bertrand's voluptuous girlfriend Christine, but he is stuck in a contentious relationship with Margaret, another lecturer in his department.  He dislikes Margaret intensely, considering her neurotic and unattractive, but he can't help but feel a little guilty over her recent suicide attempt.    <br />This background is used for further comic developments in which Jim must extricate himself from various quagmires, such as his attempt to conceal the damage to the Welches' bedsheets caused by his burning cigarette, his ploy to get Bertrand to bring Christine to a dance to present him with an opportunity for a rendezvous, and his attempt to deliver a scholarly lecture on &quot;Merrie England&quot; while quite inebriated. <br />Amis is masterful in the way he sets up these predicaments for his protagonist and allows him to conquer them one by one, capitalizing on each scene's full comic potential, finally emerging with something like a twisted fairy-tale happy ending.  Overall, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; is a novel that deflates intellectual and artistic pretentiousness in a smart (as opposed to vulgar) manner.	2001-02-07

They are not merely ignorant, selfish, and strange, but their outright stupidity exposes their ignorance, selfishness, and strangeness to both comic and tragic effect in problems that require only a modicum of education and common sense to solve.<br />As the novel begins, Addie Bundren is lying on her deathbed, her oldest son Cash is building her coffin meticulously within sight and earshot of her, and the family physician, Peabody, who considers the Bundrens a public nuisance, is attending to her.  When she dies, her body must lie in the house a couple of days until her sons Darl and Jewel return with the wagon to transport the coffin to a cemetery in Jefferson, many miles away.  Addie's husband Anse, her pregnant teenage daughter Dewey Dell, and her youngest son Vardaman are looking forward to the trip to Jefferson only as an opportunity for their ulterior motives:  Anse would like to get a new set of false teeth; Dewey Dell, an abortion, or something from a drug store that she thinks will abort the pregnancy; and Vardaman, a toy train.  Not one of them is in mourning.<br />Their journey to Jefferson is fraught with hazards.  A recent flood has washed out the bridges over a river they need to cross, so they must make a circuitous route and ford the river, in which Cash breaks his leg and the mules pulling the wagon drown.  On an overnight stop, they store Addie's coffin in a barn, which catches fire during the night.  All the while, the decaying body attracts buzzards and disgusts onlookers, while Vardaman confuses his mother with a fish he had caught the day she died.  Darl, the most sane and conscientious one in the family, knows that the journey to Jefferson is a farce and attempts to sabotage it.  He is placed in a mental institution for his action, which only relieves him from having to be around his family.<br />The novel is divided into 59 sections, each narrated with a distinctive voice and perspective by one of the Bundrens or their acquaintances.  As with the Compson family in &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; information about the Bundrens and their secrets is revealed little by little throughout each character's narration, and Faulkner makes some (but not as much) use of the stream-of-consciousness technique.  Faulkner's characters are much bigger, deeper, and more complex than anything that can be said about them.  I can think of no other writer that gets as far inside his characters' heads and makes them so real, as though the reader were sitting right next to them and talking to them.	2001-01-29

A political prisoner himself, Koestler had a lot to say about the treatment of those who were considered threats to the Communist ideal.  Although Koestler does not name the Party or the associated countries, the implications are obvious, including the identity of the Party's leader, who is known simply by the name &quot;No. 1.&quot;<br />The novel concerns a fifty-ish man named Rubashov, a high-ranking Party official, who is imprisoned for suspected acts of dissension against the Party.  Placed in a lonely cell, he communicates with the occupant of the neighboring cell by tapping on the interposing wall.  He finds that his anonymous neighbor holds a grudge against him for reasons he refuses to reveal.  The prison is filled with people considered &quot;enemies&quot; of the Party, victims of snitching and backstabbing from various levels of bureaucracy.  <br />An old friend and battalion commander of Rubashov's, named Ivanov, turns out to be his primary inquisitor.  Rubashov and Ivanov have long discussions about the ideals of the Party and how Rubashov is losing faith in a system he once fought so vehemently to establish.  The Party's ideals were noble in the beginning, but it gradually became inefficient and underhanded.  During his imprisonment, Rubashov recalls Arlova, a secretary with whom he had an affair, who was fired from her job and sentenced to death for suspected political dissension.  Rubashov had the chance to save her by testifying in her defense, but doing so could have damaged his own career.   <br />When Ivanov shows some sympathy for Rubashov, he is &quot;removed&quot; and replaced with a stricter interrogator named Gletkin, who uses draconian tactics to wear Rubashov down to the point of confession.  Rubashov is accused of various attempted acts of governmental sabotage, including a planned assassination of No. 1.The reader sees that it is not relevant to his &quot;trial&quot; whether or not he actually committed these crimes; they are merely trying to get rid of those who threaten the stability of the Party. <br />Koestler demonstrates how the creation of the Soviet Union formed a nation of political prisoners.  These are the problems of a government that is concerned more with theory than with practice; that is concerned more with ideals than with individuals.	2001-01-29

A young man named Prince Myshkin is returning from a Swiss sanatorium where he has been treated for the past few years for some malady similar to epilepsy.  He meets a roguish young man named Rogozhin, who has an unhealthy obsession with a beautiful young woman named Nastasya Filippovna, and a nosy government official named Lebedyev, who figures prominently throughout the novel.<br />Upon arriving in Petersburg, Myshkin acquaints himself with many of the citizens and eventually meets, and is infatuated by, Nastasya.  She is pushy, fickle, and impetuous, and bounces from fiance to fiance like a fortune hunter.  Her irresistibility and psychological stronghold on the men in her life leads to her downfall.  <br />The basis of the novel is that Myshkin is not bright, has not had much education, and traverses society with a mentality of simplistic innocence.  When speaking his opinion, he struggles to articulate himself with Charlie Brown-like stammering and wishy-washiness.  For this reason, people consider him an idiot, but he is a good, honest, sympathetic, and gracious person.  When he comes into a large inheritance, he is blackmailed by a man who claims to be the illegitimate son of Myshkin's benefactor; but when the man's story is debunked, Myshkin befriends rather than chastises the culprit and his accomplices.  Myshkin also falls in love with and becomes betrothed to a giddy girl named Aglaia, who uses his ingenuousness as a foil for her jokes and sarcasm, despite his undying devotion to her. <br />The novel seems to say that a saintly man, making his way in a society that is concerned with materialism and cutthroat avarice, will be considered a childish idiot for valuing honesty, kindness, and the simple things in life.  Like I said, the ending is a shocker and sends a plaintive message, that in a crazy world, a sanatorium is the only place for a saint.	2001-01-23

Dust storms and poor irrigation have turned large areas of farmland in the prairie states into a Dust Bowl.  Tenant farmers, unable to grow crops and pay rent to their landlords, have been forced off their land by the banks.  The starving farmers are lured to California by the promise of plentiful fruit-picking jobs, only to find it an unattainable paradise.<br />The novel follows the pilgrimage of an Oklahoma family named the Joads and their friend, a former preacher named Jim Casy.  When the novel begins, Tom Joad has just gotten out of prison and returns home to find that his family is one of the many that have been dispossessed by the land-owning company.  They are preparing to drive to California to seek better farming opportunities.  The road to California is a wasteland of unfriendly cops, opportunistic salesmen, unemployed drifters, and lonely souls, all seen from the vista of the Joads' rickety truck.  The chapters alternate between the Joads' specific experiences and interludes that give a sort of large-scale third-party perspective to the general plight of the land and the people.<br />Once in the fertile valleys of central California, the Joads learn the reality of the job situation:  The farm owners have lured many more people than necessary to fill the available jobs, so they get to hire those who are willing to work for the least money.  The surplus of migrant farm workers group together in encampments called Hoovervilles and wait desperately for news about new jobs, while they are forced to face the hostility of the locals who call them &quot;Okies&quot; and consider them wage-deflating scabs.  The living conditions are deplorable and the Joads can barely afford the most meager of food.<br />The Joads eventually find work picking peaches at a large farm that operates almost like a labor camp, with armed guards stationed around to ensure there are no worker uprisings.  It is here that Casy, who has been rallying for worker unionization, is martyrized when he is killed by a goon trying to break up a worker strike.  Towards the end of the book, in Tom's &quot;farewell&quot; speech to his mother, Steinbeck conveys his message of the importance of worker organization and unionization to prevent exploitation by employers.<br />&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is thoroughly depressing to the very end.  It has been accused of being too didactic and heavy-handed, but it's a book that needed to be written and one that took a lot of guts to do so.  Who else but Steinbeck could have treated the downtrodden with so much dignity and sympathy without being condescending?  Who else could have invested so much detail in even the seemingly least important characters, such as the one-eyed man in the junkyard, the storekeeper at the peach farm, and the fervently religious Lisbeth Sandry, making them unforgettable symbols of humanity?  This book is an education.  After reading it, everything else seems shallow.ith armed guards stationed around to ensure there are no worker uprisings.

It is a lawless land of mostly Mexican and Native American inhabitants, recently seized by American occupation.  Father Latour takes residence in Santa Fe, later becoming an Archbishop, and Father Vaillant goes to Albuquerque and later up to Colorado to establish a missionary church at Pike's Peak during the gold rush.<br />The two priests build a religious foundation and provide spiritual and material aid for all the parishioners, rich and poor, devout and indifferent, Mexican, Indian, and American.  Among the people they meet are the famous frontiersman Kit Carson, who takes charge of a Mexican girl on the run from her abusive, murderous husband, a couple of wealthy benefactors, and two friendly Indian guides, Jacinto and Eusabio, who educate them about tribal customs and superstitions.  The priests also find themselves in dispute with two corrupt local priests, the licentious Father Martinez and the miserly Father Lucero.<br />Unlike Sinclair Lewis's contemporary &quot;Elmer Gantry,&quot; Cather's novel is about good, honest clergymen, and she keeps her story straightforward and free of cynicism.  The solemn, austere existence of the priests is complemented perfectly by the beauty and innocence of the landscape.  Cather's vivid, colorful descriptions of the Southwestern deserts, hills, and adobe houses are matchless and mesmerizing; the book is like a Georgia O'Keeffe painting set to prose.	2001-01-02

In the picaresque &quot;Rob Roy,&quot; Sir Walter Scott uses the legend of Rob Roy Campbell MacGregor, a Scottish Robin Hood-like character, as a backdrop on which to superimpose his own story of a young Englishman named Francis (Frank) Osbaldistone. <br />Frank is uninterested in going into his father's merchant business and travels north to live with his uncle and his six cousins at their country estate.  He learns that his sinister cousin Rashleigh, who apprentices himself to Frank's father, has plans to embezzle money from the business to finance the Scottish Jacobite rebellion of 1715, in which Rob Roy is a major player.  Rob Roy and Frank befriend each other during a series of adventures in which Frank attempts to extricate his father's business from Rashleigh's treachery.  Scott writes Rashleigh as the broadest kind of villain, ensuring that he has not a single sympathetic quality.  The final confrontation between Frank and Rashleigh in the last chapter is particularly corny and the outcome predictable.  <br />I found the two major heroines of the novel to be interesting.  Diana (&quot;Die&quot;) Vernon, who lives at Frank's uncle's estate, is betrothed to one of Frank's cousins but enamors Frank.  She and Rob Roy's wife, Helen, are portrayed as strong in spirit, honorable to their causes, and capable of taking care of themselves.  <br />My problem with the book is that Scott's prose, despite some wonderful descriptions of Scotland's scenery, is so padded and overwrought that it bogs down the narration and obscures the finer points of the plot.  He has trouble maintaining suspense and providing surprises in a story that is basically about crime and intrigue.  Moments of tension are dulled by inessential, superfluous dialogue, and not enough dialogue is supplied where it would be most useful in developing the characters or situations.  For example, when Frank meets a traveler named Morris who is secretive about the contents of his traveling chest, Scott describes Morris's trepidation with narration instead of using dialogue between Frank and Morris which would more effectively and subtly establish Morris's character and the reason for his apprehension.   <br />In short, &quot;Rob Roy&quot; is a good story but is not great storytelling.	2000-12-29

Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; appears to be an allegory, spiced with satirical commentary, on the political course of modern India and the in-fighting of its various social and religious factions.  It is an endlessly inventive book with a cheeky sense of humor and wild, exotic imagery, but it does not eschew somber moments.  Rushdie presents this novel as the autobiography of Saleem Sinai, writing from his current residence at a Bombay pickle factory under the critical eye of his frequently interruptive lover/fiance Padma.  <br />Saleem was born on the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the precise moment of India's independence from Great Britain and Pakistan's formation.  He and one thousand other babies (the Midnight's Children) born in India throughout the hour each has some supernatural power such as witchcraft, time travel, gender alteration, etc., or otherwise is simply a mutant.  Kind of like the X-Men, except they're too self-serving to band together and fight crime (and too bad, as there is a lot of narrative potential in this idea).    <br />Saleem routinely hides in a washing-chest in his house to find inner peace away from neighborhood kids who taunt him for his large misshapen nose and other odd facial features.  One day in the chest, he has a strange accident -- he sniffs a pajama cord up his nose, triggering an effect which causes him to hear voices in his head and realize he has telepathic powers.  By telepathy, he establishes communication with the (heretofore unknown to him) other Midnight's Children, but they prove unwilling to unite.  An operation performed on his nose to stop his severe dripping snot problem clears his nasal passages to reveal an uncanny olfactory ability, enabling him to sniff out emotions and ideas as well as smells.  <br />Saleem also gives an extensive background on his family, beginning with how his maternal grandparents met, up to his pyromaniac-turned-singing-star younger sister.  After his (Muslim) family relocates to Pakistan, almost all of them are killed in the 1965 India-Pakistan war, and in the 1971 war for the independence of Bangladesh, Saleem is conscripted in the Pakistani Army as a human bloodhound.<br />Eventually, Saleem marries Parvati, one of the Midnight's Children, the witch, who bears a child fathered by his arch enemy Shiva, another of the Midnight's Children, whose special attribute is his ability to crush people with his overdeveloped knees.  Shiva works as an agent for the government of India, who demand to know the indentities and whereabouts of all the Midnight's Children, and Saleem is the only one who can tell them...<br />Like E.L. Doctorow's &quot;Ragtime,&quot; &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; blurs the line between historical fact and fiction, weaving fantastic events against a realistic backdrop of a land in turmoil.  Saleem is an extraordinary character, not a hero in the traditional sense but a deformed symbol, a vessel for carrying and displaying the problems and hopes of the people of India.	2000-12-21

This was a time of crucial social and political restructuring of American society, when a large influx of European immigrants coincided with the Industrial Revolution's increasing need for mechanized, low-skill labor, leading to exploitation of workers and the consequent formation of labor unions.  <br />At the center of the novel is a nameless family in New Rochelle, New York, representing a rising middle class.  The father runs a patriotic flag and fireworks company, and for sport accompanies Robert Peary's expedition to the North Pole.  The mother's younger brother is a clever but impetuous young man who represents a growing social consciousness in the bourgeois fabric.  The family takes in a poor young black woman and her baby.  The woman has attracted a suitor, a black pianist named Coalhouse Walker who plays Scott Joplin rags for the family when he comes to visit.  One day, when some racist firemen extort Walker for money and vandalize his car, his pique incites a chain reaction of violence and terror in his quest for justice.  <br />This story is intertwined with that of a family of destitute Jewish immigrants  who have arrived in New York from Latvia.  The father, who makes fancy silhouettes for a living, draws a series of flippable sketches to entertain his daughter, inventing the art of animation and eventually becoming a mogul in the burgeoning film industry. <br />Meanwhile, the stories of several famous personages play like a tabloid in the background:  Houdini performs daring feats of escape; prominent New York architect Stanford White is shot by eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw for fooling around with his wife; the fantastically wealthy financier J.P. Morgan lives like a king and indulges his fascination with Egyptology; Henry Ford utilizes the concept of interchangeability of parts, jobs, and workers to mass-produce cheap cars.  There are also briefcameos by Freud, Theodore Dreiser, and Booker T. Washington.     <br />Doctorow writes as though he were creating a series of journal entries for a magazine, detailing everything that happens to the characters without getting too close or attached to them.  Interestingly, there is only narration in the novel; all the dialogue is quotationless.  On first glance the book may look ponderous because of this, but actually the short, declarative sentences and light tone keep the pace lively.  It's rare to find a novel like this that informs as well as it entertains.	2000-12-13

Lawrence's &quot;Sons and Lovers,&quot; the Morel family lives in a coal mining village in late 19th Century rural England; the father Walter is a coal miner who comes home drunk every night and fights, often physically, with his wife and children.  Unable to control her husband's unruliness, Mrs. Morel directs her affection to her three sons, instigating them to turn against their father.  Her love for her sons is not merely maternal, but so possessive that she gets jealous when the boys focus their attention on the neighborhood girls, whom she treats with haughty condescension.  <br />Paul, the middle son, is Lawrence's alter ego.  He aspires to be an artist but works as a clerk in a surgical appliance factory to bring money home to the family.  When his older brother William dies of pneumonia, Paul replaces him as the primary object of his mother's affections.  At times their mutual endearment is so extreme and smothering that it's downright creepy, such as when she embraces Paul and tells him that she never &quot;really&quot; had a husband, implying that Paul somehow must act as a spousal surrogate.<br />Paul starts a shy relationship with a girl named Miriam, but his mother's guilt trip prevents him from making a full commitment.  Eventually he turns his interest to an older woman, Clara Dawes, who works in his factory and is separated from her husband.  As opposed to the clingy, sensitive, virginal Miriam, Clara is liberated, proud, aloof, sexually passionate, and generally distrustful of men.  Her husband, who also works in the factory, is a loose cannon and tries violently to intimidate Paul.    <br />Paul's relationships with Miriam and Clara are full of tension and antagonism.  He unleashes on the women the hostilities that he had stored subconsciously against his mother, criticizing them for faults displayed by Mrs. Morel and not their own.  It is ironic that his mother dies from cancer, since Paul realizes that his mother's cancerous influence onhim lingers even after her death.  <br />Lawrence's motive in writing this book may have been to exorcise some childhood and adolescent demons, maybe in an attempt to explain his own personal relationships with women.  At any rate, he is an excellent writer; like W. Somerset Maugham, his prose is direct and unpretentious, and he can write romantic scenes and dialogue without being melodramatic or tawdry.  The theme of maternal influence is timeless, relevant in any age, and Lawrence captures it perfectly.	2000-12-11

The main action of the novel takes place in his visit to one of the buildings, trying to collect late rent from deadbeat tenants and checking up on the incompetent superintendent, many of whose tasks Leon ends up doing himself.    <br />Leon is continually distracted by memories of his ex-girlfriend Magda, who had suffered some kind of mental breakdown years ago.  Despite his best efforts, he was unable to help her, to bring her back from the brink of self-destruction, and even was blamed for her problem by Magda's mother.  The apartment building is his redemption.  Here he can be what his boss, Mr. Fein, calls a &quot;mensch,&quot; that is, a man, a responsible person.  He finds satisfaction and deliverance in taking care of this building, filled with destitute, broken people who don't know how to take care of themselves.  He is meek and reticent and probably not well suited to dealing with uncooperative and rowdy tenants, but he sticks with the job because he feels he has to prove something to himself; he has to be a mensch.<br />On this particular day, Mr. Fein has decided to sell the troublesome building to a rival landlord named Hakim, whose negligence for his own slums makes Fein's buildings look like the Waldorf Astoria by comparison.  When Leon confronts Fein and Hakim during the closing of the deal, his emotions reach a boiling point when he senses his responsibility, his chance to be a mensch, being taken away from him.  Leon's name means &quot;lion,&quot; of course, a normally gentle and mellow animal that springs into ferocity when provoked.<br />This novel is bleak in both its setting and its mood, but the grayness of the story is counterbalanced by Weiss's use of colorful, original similes and metaphors found on every page.  It is a unique portrayal of an unhappy young man who is struggling to grow up in his own way (Why is he carrying around the faucet all day?  Is it a symbol of the manhood he is trying to assert?) and find value in his existence.	2000-12-11

It refuses to leave my psyche, even while I'm trying to read a new book.<br />&quot;The Magus&quot; is about a young English man named Nicholas Urfe who gets a teaching job at a private school on a small Greek island.  On a remote part of the island, he discovers a luxurious villa owned by a mysterious wealthy man named Conchis who apparently keeps to himself.  The two of them meet and strike up an odd friendship, whereupon Conchis invites Nicholas to visit his villa on weekends.  <br />In the course of these visits, Nicholas realizes that Conchis is not as solitary as he had been led to believe.  Conchis tells Nicholas the story of his life in gradual installments, but because Conchis's world is so illusory, Nicholas doesn't know how much, if any, of it he can believe.  Conchis likes to play mind games, dropping bizarre clues about himself and staging impromptu &quot;scenes&quot; designed to look like hallucinations.  He is the consummate magician, pulling ever more unpredictable things out of his hat with which to puzzle and torment Nicholas.  Nicholas is not sure why Conchis is doing these things, but he keeps returning to the villa because the bemusing games provide an interesting diversion from his boring life at the school.  Also, there is the evasive beautiful young woman who is often found in Conchis's domain and who, Nicholas is sure, holds the key to his fate... <br />   The plot unfolds like an elaborate, surrealistic con game, the kind David Mamet makes films about (&quot;The House of Games&quot; and &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot;).  The difference, and what makes the story so perplexing to me and, I suspect, many other readers, is that Fowles intentionally blurs the definition of &quot;good guy&quot; and &quot;bad guy,&quot; so that it's difficult to know what the outcome of the story &quot;should&quot; be.  Fowles transforms the reader's ideasof literary convention the same way that Conchis transforms Nicholas's ideas of perception and morality.  Nicholas begins the novel as somewhat arrogant and selfish, and by the end of his dealings with Conchis he learns a little humility (one would hope).<br />   Combining the epic richness of a Dickens novel with the macabre touches of a Poe, Lovecraft, or Kafka story, and set to an exotic, luxuriant backdrop of a beautiful Greek island, &quot;The Magus&quot; is one of the most enchanting, fun, and lovingly frustrating novels I've ever read, one I'm not likely to forget.	2000-11-27

Sonalal's personal life is sad: he is simple and uneducated, his marriage to his wife Sarita is loveless but tolerable, his two young sons hardly respect his profession, and he spends much of his free time drinking and visiting his favorite prostitute, Reena.<br />One day, Sonalal and Raju are performing in front of a large group of tourists, when Raju, who is fatigued from having danced all day, becomes irritable and bites Sonalal.  In a fit of vengeful anger, Sonalal shocks the crowd by killing Raju in a most extraordinary way.

He also realizes, with anxiety and bitterness, that his fame arose not from his beautiful music but from his sensational behavior.  His guilt causes him maladies, sexual impotence, and loss of desire and ability to play music.  In order to regain all his functions, he consults various acquaintances for advice, including a fellow snake charmer, a street magician, a medical doctor, and a comical sex therapist.

As society becomes more industrialized, products become more homogeneous and standardized, art and expression become less important, and personal individuality is gradually lost.  In such a world, a government would attempt to keep its population as happy and content as possible by &quot;conditioning&quot; the people from birth to accept and love their assigned work and their respective places in society.  Such people would need to be deprived of emotional stimulation so as not to get any subversive ideas, so artistic expression would have to be curtailed.

The perpetuation of civilization and society would have to be more important than the value of the individual.<br />The novel's main action is in London in the year A.F. 632 (it doesn't take long to figure out what A.F. stands for).  Human reproduction and gestation is handled in laboratories where bottled embryos are separated into caste systems, from Alpha (the highest) to Epsilon (the lowest).  All embryos are conditioned for certain jobs; Alphas are conditioned to be the most intelligent and receive the most education, while Epsilons are reserved for the most menial jobs.  The different castes are segregated and identified by the color of the clothes they wear.  To keep everybody happy and ensure civil obedience, a depression-fighting drug called &quot;soma&quot; is officially distributed.  There is no art for art's sake; the only music that exists is always synthetic and is purely functional, as are the &quot;feelies,&quot; movies with tactile and aromatic as well as visual and aural signals.<br />A keen point of interest is the book's reference to Henry Ford.  Ford, one of the great industrialists, is a symbol of the semination of the industrialized society of the Brave New World, a sort of patron saint of the assembly line and mass production.  The fact that &quot;Ford&quot; rhymes with &quot;Lord&quot; provides the novel with its prevalent running joke.  Huxley seems to have had the same kind of sarcastic or facetious respect for Ford that many people today have for Bill Gates.<br />While the beginning of the novel serves to describe the Society and introduce a few main characters, the novel's conflict arises when a &quot;Savage&quot; named John, who was born and raised outside of the industrialized world in a New Mexico Indian reservation, is brought to London as a subject for study.  From reading Shakespeare as a youth, John has acquired compassion, sensitivity, and artistic and religious aesthetic (Huxley almost seems to imply that Shakespeare is a sort of gateway to a higher consciousness), and is horrified by the lack of emotion and morality of the inhabitants of the Brave New World.  John makes a conscious decision to foresake the synthetic happiness of the Brave New World and return to living freely and naturally, but he finds that he cannot escape public scrutiny so easily.<br />Huxley's writing has an almost cinematic quality; he is like a cutting-edge film director who edits scenes and shifts focus between various characters quickly for maximum dramatic effect.  Even his images of large mechanical systems are poetic and, from an engineering standpoint, accurately detailed.  To me, that's the icing on the cake for this richly conceived treatise on a nightmarish utopia.Ford, one of the great industrialists, is a symbol of the semination of the industrialized society of the Brave New World, a sort of patron saint of the assembly line and mass production.

I was interested in reading Jack Kerouac's &quot;On the Road,&quot; his record of the &quot;Beat Generation,&quot; after seeing it at #55 on the Modern Library's Best 100 English Language novels of the Twentieth Century.  After finishing the book, I'm left scratching my head in dissatisfied wonder.<br />Kerouac narrates under the pseudonym of Sal Paradise, as a writer whose career is underway.  He meets a character named Dean Moriarty, a bad seed who aspires to be a writer and admires Paradise's work.  The two of them crisscross the country with various friends and girlfriends looking for life experiences which turn out to be pretty mundane after all.  That's it.  That's all the book is about.<br />What frustrated me about the book is not that Paradise and Moriarty are unappealing characters (they think it's okay to cheat on girlfriends, abandon wives and children, and pilfer food and gas from modest small-town storekeepers), but rather that Kerouac is such a bland writer with little to no penchant for description.  The people and places he writes about are potentially fascinating, but Kerouac attacks his material with all the insight and depth of a fourth grader writing his &quot;What I Did During My Summer Vacation&quot; report.  His descriptions of Hollywood, San Francisco, Mexico, the jazz clubs, etc., etc., places of intrigue and passion, are so stoic they defy belief.<br />&quot;Beat&quot; seems to be an adjective Kerouac used as a synonym for tired or worn-down, which I suppose he meant to refer to his generation.  His generation surely deserves a better representation than this.	2000-11-09

Bolivar's goal was to unite South America into a single great country, but there was constant conflict with separatists and political and military rivals, and in the last year of his life he was expelled from the presidency.  He left Bogota with an entourage of close friends, relatives, and servants, and his final months were spent in a journey down the River Magdalena, ostensibly to leave the country.  A terminal illness (consumption?  tuberculosis?  his bedsheets are burned and eating utensils are buried after he uses them for fear of contagion) causes him fits of feverish delirium, in which he recalls glorious episodes in his life.<br />I once read one of Garcia Marquez's earlier short stories, &quot;A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings,&quot; and that story and this novel seem to share a theme.  They are both about an important or extraordinary figure (in the story, the title character; in this novel, Bolivar) who falls from a state of grace, comes into contact with common people, and must suffer their treatment, be it awe or indifference.  I knew almost nothing about Bolivar and the history of South America, but the fact that this fascinating novel made me want to learn more about the subject is a testament to Garcia Marquez's great skill as a writer.	2000-11-06
US	49396726	R39NA4Q2R9K6P5	0786107421	111847135	I, Claudius	Books	5	6	6	N	N	S.P.Q.R. (Super Positive Quick Review)	Robert Graves's fictionalized autobiography of Claudius, the fourth Emperor of Rome, is so phenomenally fascinating that any review I write can hardly do it justice.  Claudius writes that he was born prematurely and afflicted with many physical infirmities that make his life difficult and uncomfortable.  Most of his relatives consider him an idiot due to his stammering and twitching and treat him with derision and condescension.  However, he was a bright, studious boy who used his time to better his mind in the subjects of history and politics, and he becomes a dedicated historian and accomplished writer.  <br />As a member of the Imperial family, Claudius has an insider's perspective of Roman politics at the beginning of the Empire and the Pax Romana.  The novel begins with an account of the end of the Republic around 40 B.C., how Claudius's wickedly scheming grandmother Livia masterminded much of the politics which led to the formation of the Empire, and how her husband and Claudius's great-uncle Augustus Caesar became the first Emperor.  The reigns of Claudius's depraved uncle Tiberius and insane nephew Caligula follow, and Claudius finally becomes Emperor, somewhat reluctantly, upon Caligula's death in 41 A.D.<br />What I found extremely interesting about the book is that it explains the complications of maintaining, defending, and expanding an empire.  The detailed descriptions of the military campaigns show how the frontiers of the Empire (especially Germany) were in constant danger of disruption by barbarians and mutinous, undisciplined soldiers.  Back home in the Senate and within the Imperial family, petty squabbles and indignities were often resolved with scandalously drastic measures.  <br />This book could have been a dry recounting of history, but Claudius tells his story in a conversational, often humorous, tone.  (What he writes about Caligula, in particular, is unbelievable but highly entertaining.)  Another thing that strikes me as the mark of a great book: Even though Livia is a thoroughly despicable human being, I actually felt a little sad when she died.  Not too many writers can achieve that kind of dichotomy in their characters.	2000-10-04

It concerns a man named Billy Pilgrim who becomes &quot;unstuck in time,&quot; meaning he involuntarily travels back and forth between various episodes in his lifetime, something like temporal schizophrenia.  The conventional notion of time is disregarded in this book, so our familiar structure of past, present, and future is in discord with the chronology of the events.  <br />As a young man, Billy serves in World War II as a chaplain's assistant.  He ends up behind enemy lines with a morbid creep named Roland Weary who educates him about the sickest torture methods known to man.  They're captured by German soldiers and taken to a prison camp where Billy is stalked by another creep named Paul Lazzaro.  Soon Billy and the other prisoners are shipped into Dresden to be laborers, and for living quarters they are put into an old slaughterhouse marked with the number five.  A visiting American-turned-Nazi dignitary attempts to proselytize them just before they are forced to cower in an underground meat locker while Allied aircraft bomb and decimate the city. <br />After the war, Billy becomes an optometrist, marries, raises a family, and lives every semblance of a normal life except, of course, for the time travel.  His imagination is fueled by the science fiction novels of a writer named Kilgore Trout, who is no stranger to the concept of time travel.  <br />Later, Billy is kidnapped by aliens from a planet called Tralfamadore and  exhibited in a zoo on their planet, in an Earthling-accommodating habitat furnished by merchandise the aliens stole from a Sears warehouse in Iowa City.  The Tralfamadorians have also kidnapped an Earthling woman, a movie star named Montana Wildhack, to provide Billy with a mate.<br />Keep in mind that these events are not related in chronological order, but rather are intertwined with each other as Billy zaps back and forth between milieus.  <br />It's difficult to decipher all ofthis, but Vonnegut makes it clear in the first chapter that this is an anti-war novel, comparing the Children's Crusade of the Middle Ages to sending teenagers off to fight modern wars.  He satirizes the pro-war mentality that rationalizes brutality in the name of dubious ideals, the slaughtering of some to save others.  The consequences of war are acceptable only if, like the Tralfamadorians, you have no past, present, or future to account for.	2000-10-04
US	49396726	RHXICMJ1CPYI9	0679722645	951875669	The Maltese Falcon	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Roll yourself another cigarette, Sam.	In &quot;The Maltese Falcon,&quot; Sam Spade and his partner Miles Archer operate a detective agency in San Francisco circa 1930.  Spade, the archetypal private eye, keeps liquor in his desk drawer and rolls his own cigarettes.  Frequently.  Unlike Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe novels, the action is written in third person, but the focus remains on Spade.<br />A young woman calling herself Miss Wonderly, flashing a lot of cash, hires Spade and Archer to follow a man she suspects is hiding her missing sister.  That night, Archer and the man are shot dead in different places and within minutes of each other.  The cops suspect Spade as Archer's killer and are breathing down Spade's neck, and it doesn't help his case that he's been having an affair with Archer's clingy, melodramatic widow. <br />Meanwhile, Spade is engaged by a gaudily dressed fop named Joel Cairo and a globular glutton named Gutman to locate a specific statuette of a black bird with an ancient history.  The so-called &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot; is or has been under the guardianship of a coolly devious vixen named Brigid O'Shaughnessy, who becomes Spade's romantic foil.  The villains are painted in strokes so broad I can feel the dye bleeding off the pages into my fingers.  <br />Spade's detective work is acute but the plot doesn't allow much payoff from it; eventually the falcon almost literally falls into his lap.  I also found the last couple of chapters anticlimactic and not very exciting, with too much parleying between the hero and the villains.  There is one good plot revelation at the end, though, which almost makes it all worthwhile.  While I prefer the rapid-fire dialogue, labyrinthine plots, and subtle characterization of Chandler's Marlowe novels (admittedly conceived well after and undeniably influenced by Spade), &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; gives a fine glimpse of the mystery novel breaking English barriers and drifting to American shores.	2000-10-04

James Dickey's &quot;Deliverance&quot; is a study of how a civilized,  peaceful, law-abiding man chooses a &quot;kill or be killed&quot; mentality  when he is trapped in a life-or-death situation by an unforeseeable danger.   The novel opens with four middle-aged white-collar men from Atlanta  planning a weekend canoe trip down a river in northeastern Georgia.  Lewis  Medlock is the experienced outdoorsman and adventurer of the group; he  seeks to conquer the wilderness and boasts of the injuries he's received  and hardships he's overcome in his fishing and hunting excursions.  Ed  Gentry, the narrator, a graphic design consultant by profession, is an avid  archer but does not quite share Lewis's love of the outdoors.  Accompanying  them are the sensible Drew, a sales executive for a soft drink company, and  Bobby, indecisive, emasculated, and almost completely out of his  element.<br />The river flows through rocky, mountainous terrain, one of those  areas in which all the human inhabitants are presumably related to each  other.  Some of the locals try to discourage the men from tackling the  river with canoes, but Lewis is resolute, and they set off down the river  as planned.  The trip goes smoothly the first day, but the next day, Ed and  Bobby run into trouble -- a terrifying encounter with two murderous,  animalistic backwoods goons.  Lewis and Drew arrive in time to save Ed's  and Bobby's lives, but not without a price.  When the four men try to  escape down the river, Lewis, the strongest and best hunter among them,  breaks his leg in a passage through some vicious rapids.  Trapped in a  gorge and stalked by a vengeful assailant, the men must rely on Ed to save  their lives.     <br />&quot;Deliverance&quot; could be a simple tale of  revenge and bravado, but what separates it from generic adventure stories  is the sheer descriptive power of Dickey's writing.  He evokes the  refreshing water spray and stunning scenery of the ride down the river, the  violence of crashing against rocks through rapids, the feel of a tense  bowstring in the hand of a man who is fighting for his life, and the  struggle of Ed's desperate white-knuckled climb up the treacherous cliff  face to escape the gorge.  &quot;Deliverance&quot; shows that great  literature and harrowing adventure are not mutually exclusive.	2000-09-05

John Grimes has just turned fourteen and  his family expects him to become a preacher like his father Gabriel.  However, John realizes that he has reservations about this profession,  partially due to a mutual lack of respect and love for his father.  After a  turbulent scene in which his younger brother Roy (the name is significant,  referring to a ghost in Gabriel's past) has been brutally injured in a  knife fight, John and his family attend a Saturday night service at the  storefront church where his father is a deacon.<br />The night's passionate  prayers evoke flashbacks to the personal histories of the adults in John's  family, depicting the events that brought them to Harlem from their  respective towns in the South and the development of their attitudes  towards religion and love.  John's Aunt Florence, Gabriel's older sister,  fled from her ailing mother and drunken, disorderly brother and came North  to seek better opportunities, only to end up in an unhappy marriage with a  man who turned out to be not much different from her brother.  Gabriel  cleaned up his life after his mother died, became a preacher, and married  an older woman who was sympathetic and supportive to him during his  troubled times, although he strayed in one fateful instance, for which  Florence still harbors resentment towards him.  John's mother Elizabeth  originally came to Harlem with her boyfriend in a doomed affair, and later  she and Gabriel got married after he became a widower.<br />Although John is  the central character, the novel focuses more on the lives of Gabriel,  Elizabeth, and Florence, and how their respective backgrounds shaped John's  physical upbringing and spiritual development.  Generally, it is a  statement on religion as an important influence on the American black  experience.  And it is a brilliant example of style: The structure is  unique and effective,the prose is beautifully eloquent in its symbolism  and imagery, and the dialogue is sharply realistic and thoughtful.	2000-08-29

The protagonist is Roth himself, who has just overcome a  period of Halcion-induced depression and is preparing to fly to Israel on a  journalistic assignment to interview a Holocaust-surviving author.   Coinciding with this event is the trial of John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian  American citizen extradited to Israel, who is alleged to have been a  sadistic SS guard branded Ivan the Terrible at the Treblinka death camp  during World War II.<br />Just before making his trip, Roth hears that  somebody in Israel is using his name to promote a new Diaspora, imploring  the Ashkenazi Jews to return to Europe to reclaim their cultural heritage.   Once in Israel, it's not long before he encounters his impersonator after  attending a session of Demjanjuk's trial.  The impersonator tells Roth that  he is a private detective from Chicago and that he runs a counseling  service to &quot;cure&quot; anti-Semites, similar to Alcoholics Anonymous  in its purpose.  Accompanying him in Israel is his girlfriend and a former  anti-Semite, a confused American woman with a checkered past, who was his  nurse when he was a cancer patient.  <br />Roth's impersonator sees himself as  the influential equal and  ideological opposite of Theodore Herzl, the  founder of Zionism.  He advocates Diasporism because he fears that the  state of Israel is perceived by the world as Jewish tyranny over Arabs and  will lead to a second Holocaust.  How the real Roth reacts to this premise  develops the rest of the novel, which, as the title implies, shapes itself  into a subtle spy story.  Some interesting supporting characters are  introduced to contribute to the debate and clever plot devices are employed  for intrigue.	2000-08-28

This novel is only barely about political process and instead  focuses on the quest of a man to uncover the past and how his discoveries  lead to the undoing of a state of grace.<br />The man (and narrator) is Jack  Burden, who starts out as a local  newspaper reporter in a thinly disguised  Louisiana.  A young,  temperate, idealistic county treasurer named Willie  Stark comes to Burden's attention during a minor scandal.  Stark refuses to  give in to a kickback scheme involving a contract for a schoolhouse  construction project and is promptly ousted from his position.  Burden's  reporting of Stark's honesty starts Stark on a path toward a political  career.  After years of developing himself as an orator and demagogue,  Stark becomes Governor and hires Burden to be a sort of right-hand man in  his administration.<br />During his political rise, Stark transforms from a  naive idealist into a cynical imperialist, as his relationships to his wife  and son grow distant.  He is the manipulative type of man who will slap a  friend reassuringly on the shoulder while browbeating and intimidating  members of his administration (the &quot;king's men&quot;), such as making  them write resignation letters that he personally will date when he wants  to get rid of them.  Especially symbolic is the possum incident at the end  of Chapter 1: The Willie Stark political machine crushes anything that gets  under its wheels. <br />Stark commands Burden, who is a former history student  with experience in research, to dig up dirt on a political dissenter who  happens to be one of Burden's lifelong friends.  In doing so, Burden  uncovers a revelation that shatters not only his own life but the lives of  several people close to him.  The novel ends with the weight of a  Shakespearean tragedy, where the line of responsibility weaves directly and  indirectly through several major characters.<br />Robert Penn Warren writes in  a style that alternates between straight hard dialogue and poetic  philosophical musings.  It's not easy to see where the novel is going after  reading only the first couple of chapters; Warren takes his time unfolding  the story to allow the reader to develop a genuine interest in the  characters and appreciate the wealth of ideas presented.	2000-08-16

He would just like to  &quot;be.&quot;  His troubles begin when he learns that his mother has died  and attends her funeral, showing no remorse for having been inattentive to  her during her final years.  Through a series of events, he arrives at a  situation where he murders a man on a beach, an action seemingly provoked  only by the sun.  The tone of the book is such that Meursault is not meant  to be judged for his actions, just observed. <br />The supreme irony of  &quot;The Stranger&quot; is that Meursault is as honest as a person can be,  yet it's because of this honesty that he is ultimately punished.  The  problem (or is it a problem?) is that Meursault is honest not only about  what he does but about what he feels.  Society's sense of decency is  offended by the fact that he would not show any emotions at his mother's  funeral and shortly after would go swimming and see a movie with his  girlfriend rather than spend some time in mourning.  His prosecutors in the  murder trial use these acts as evidence to establish his character in the  minds of the jurors as callous and decadent.<br />Like Franz Kafka's &quot;The  Trial,&quot; &quot;The Stranger&quot; questions the  individual's ability  to control his own fate, with the additional idea that one person's fate is  no more or less preordained than another's.  Meursault acknowledges that he  had lived his life one way and yet could have lived another just as well:  Does it really matter?	2000-08-03

His days of glory as a high school basketball star have dissolved into a mundane adulthood.  &quot;Rabbit Redux&quot; opens in the  summer of 1969, and while Apollo II is on its way to the moon, Ted Kennedy  drives his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, nightly newscasts  report death tolls in Vietnam, and race riots and war protests are blazing  throughout the nation, Rabbit works solemnly as a typesetter at a printing  plant.  (Amusing samples of Rabbit's work are shown, including his  occasional distraction-induced mistakes.)  We see the development of  Rabbit's relationships with his growing son Nelson, his dying mother, his  doting father, and his aspiring actress sister Mim. <br />Rabbit's wife  Janice, stifled by their stagnant marriage, moves into the apartment of a  man with whom she is having an affair.  In the wake of her departure,  Rabbit meets Skeeter, a militant black Vietnam vet, and Jill, a spoiled  rich 18-year-old runaway.  Jill moves into Rabbit's house and takes on an  ambiguous daughter/lover role.  Rabbit also reluctantly allows Skeeter, who  has jumped bail on a drug possession charge, to take shelter in his house.   An interesting set of archetypes is now thrust into close quarters:  Rabbit's suburban apple green clapboard house representing middle class  America; Rabbit, traditional average white American values; Jill, the  younger  white liberal (hippie) faction; and Skeeter, the black power  movement.  <br />Skeeter engages Rabbit in heated debates about racism,  slavery, and Vietnam, with Jill acting somewhat as a mediator.  Rabbit   spouts his opinions authoritatively but without much conviction.  Possibly  lacking the mental endurance to keep up with Skeeter's rhetoric, Rabbit's  ideological conflict with Skeeter gradually gives way to concession.  He  learns to enjoy the presence of these two strangers in his house; it could  be that Nelson, Jill, and Skeeter comprise the family he's always  wanted.<br />In his discussions with Rabbit and his lifestyle at the house,   Skeeter emerges as the most complex character in the novel.  Embodying the  rage and confusion from centuries of oppression, he is alternately  resentful, wily, domestic, pedantic, perverse, or paranoid, depending on  the unpredictable trajectory of his disposition.  He is as natural playing  basketball with Nelson during the day as he is administering drugs to Jill  in exchange for sexual favors at night.  He caricatures himself as an  ingratiating Uncle Tom in the presence of a cab driver, exhorts Rabbit and  Nelson to read passages from his books aloud, and imagines himself a future  messiah.  As in &quot;Rabbit, Run,&quot; there is a tragic climax, an event  that brings this curious living arrangement to an abrupt end.  <br />As a  sequel, &quot;Rabbit Redux&quot; reflects the time in which it was written  more emphatically than &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; did; the language is more  explicit, the pacing is more frenetic, everybody seems just a little  crazier as the country seems to be on the verge of self-destruction.   Updike uses this point in history as a brilliant perspective through which  to view the development of the Angstroms as characters.	2000-07-31

The stories are subtle commentaries about  Irish attitudes towards nationalism, religion, morality, life, and death.   Each explores a distinctive, dramatic theme, such as sexual perversion  (&quot;An Encounter&quot;), infatuation (&quot;Araby&quot;), the  frustration of personal unfulfillment (&quot;A Little Cloud&quot; and  &quot;Counterparts&quot;), self-imposed loneliness (&quot;A Painful  Case&quot;), hubris (&quot;A Mother&quot;), and Catholic/Protestant  conflict (&quot;Grace&quot;).  Overtones of Irish nationalism, remembrance,  and piety permeate all the stories.    <br />The stories are neither  depressing nor uplifting, but rather  open-ended in their denouement; no  conflicts are resolved and no moral conclusions are reached.  Joyce depicts  the characters and scenes so sympathetically that the reader understands  clearly why the dejected boy in &quot;Araby&quot; leaves the bazaar feeling  like  &quot;a creature driven and derided by vanity&quot; and the events  that drive Farrington to beat his young son at the end of  &quot;Counterparts.&quot;  And why, in &quot;The Dead,&quot; Gabriel, after  giving a dinner speech in which he makes respectful reference to the dead,  feels his dignity knocked down a notch when his wife reveals to him the  tragic fate of her past love.  <br />After nearly a century,  &quot;Dubliners&quot; remains one of the best  crystallizations of humanity  bestowed upon the world.	2000-07-20

Marlowe's first lead is the nightclub owner's widow, whom he plies with  liquor, only to find out that Velma's whereabouts are being kept a guarded  secret.  Then, in what initially seems like an unrelated subplot, Marlowe  is hired by a man who wants &quot;backup&quot; while he delivers money to  some jewel thieves.  The man ends up murdered, and Marlowe meets a  mysterious girl at the scene of the crime.  To think there's no connection  between this event and Velma's disappearance would be to underestimate  Chandler's genius at plot construction.  <br />Chandler cleverly plants false  leads to twist the already unpredictable plot and subtle clues that make  sense at the end.  His colorful characters are masters of deceit; the  reader imagines that these people must have great poker faces.  They know a  lot more than what they're telling Marlowe, and it's exciting to know that  Marlowe will eventually be able to guess what they're leaving out.  Like  J.R.R. Tolkien's Gandalf, Marlowe is one of literature's greatest  magicians;  the fun of reading the book is waiting for him to pull the  rabbit out of the hat at the end.	2000-07-14

Augie is intelligent and articulate,  but he seems to wander through life passively with no definite goals and  not many interests.  As the Depression hits, he is forced to postpone his  academic pursuits in order to make a living, taking a wide variety of odd  jobs, including stealing books, organizing labor unions, and working as a  research assistant to an eccentric wealthy man writing a book about wealthy  people.  Eventually he decides to become a schoolteacher, but even this  profession is relatively short-lived.  The novel culminates in Augie's  discovery that he must align himself with the &quot;axial lines&quot; of  his life.   <br />Augie's &quot;adventures&quot; consist mainly of his getting  entangled in various affairs of his relatives, friends, girlfriends, and  employers.  These episodes range dramatically from his nearly getting  caught by the police in a stolen car, to his accompaniment of his friend  Mimi to an abortionist and her subsequent grave illness (probably a bold  thing to write about at the time), to helping his girlfriend Thea train an  eagle to hunt lizards in Mexico.  (Thea finds, to her frustration, that she  can train neither the eagle nor Augie.)  This is a bizarre assortment of  events, but the depiction of each is strangely realistic and unique. <br />The  narration is masterfully constructed with Bellow's erudite prose and  penchant for rich description.  Reading this novel is challenging but  ultimately rewarding.	2000-07-10
US	49396726	ROCNY5I71YWZF	0684833395	458864358	Catch-22	Books	5	15	17	N	N	A different kind of war novel	Having recently read and greatly enjoyed Herman Wouk's &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; and Hemingway's &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, I expected &quot;Catch-22&quot; to be a straightforward war novel.  Boy, was  I wrong, and pleasantly surprised!  <br />There are two sides to the style of  &quot;Catch-22&quot;.  On one hand, the character profiles and the bits of  dialogue showing how the characters interrelate are hilarious.  Heller's  prose is as funny as P.G. Wodehouse's and even his wry style of humor is  very similar to Wodehouse's.  But Heller is not using humor to lighten the  mood of war, nor is &quot;Catch-22&quot; merely humorous.  The other side  of the novel is its realistically gory portrayal of the atrocities of war  (some of which are even the result of &quot;friendly fire&quot;), including  detailed accounts of the sights, sounds, and terrors of flying in a World  War II bomber aircraft.  <br />Rather than present the plot in a linear,  chronological fashion,  Heller cleverly and innovatively cuts it up like a  jigsaw puzzle and lets the reader put the pieces together.  Only towards  the end of the novel, relating Yossarian's sadness at the news of Nately's  death and the events that follow, does the plot start to proceed a little  more conventionally until Yossarian makes his final decision to escape his  predicament.<br />If the novel has a theme, I'm going to go out on a limb and  say that it's about the evils of rationalization; that is, the way people  interpret and twist the logic and laws of authority or society to their own  advantage.  People's desire for power, status, and money results in excuses  for military brutality and endangering the lives of others, and  &quot;Catch-22&quot; illustrates numerous examples.	2000-06-19
US	49396726	RK3XP7DAMVHLL	0374505845	987266683	Wise Blood: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Fascinating symbolism in &quot;Wise Blood&quot;	Recently discharged from the army and without a family, a young man named Hazel Motes arrives in a strange city.  He is so completely obsessed by the desire to reject Jesus that, taking inspiration from the actions of a  wayward street preacher, he starts the &quot;Church Without Christ,&quot;  promising no salvation and no kingdom of heaven.  With this premise of  idolatry turned upside down, O'Connor spins a vaguely abstract tale  employing haunting Kafka-esque symbols and images to illustrate her  narrative.  Hazel thinks of his deceased family members while trying to  sleep in the coffin-like berch in the train.  He drives out to the country  in his newly purchased car and sees a message of salvation, conflicting  naggingly with his own beliefs, written on a roadside rock.  His newfound  acquaintance, Enoch Emery, shows him the object of his fascination, a  mummified boy in a museum.  The face of a grinning woman reflects eerily in  the glass that encases the boy; later the face appears in the window of  Hazel's car during a dream.  Enoch, whose &quot;wise blood&quot; tells him  what to do, finds dread in a picture of a moose that hangs on the wall in  his room and donates what he has decided is the &quot;new jesus&quot; to  Hazel so that he (Enoch) can return happily to a state of primitivism in a  gorilla costume.  For such a short novel, &quot;Wise Blood&quot; is  incredibly complex and is one of the most inexplicably fascinating books I  have read.	2000-06-08
