This book started off very slow, but I wasn't going to put it down.  I heard alot of people saying how good this book was.  But I would say after the first 20 pages it seemed to get interesting to the point I couldn't put it down.  I understood where Pammy was coming from trying to make a living for her and her son.  But Chico was off the hook, it was a shame how he treated Pam and her son (which was his child).  All that struggling Pam did and then it was worth nothing at the end.  Feds took everything, and Chico left her and didn't even care.  Then her homeboy settin her up was cold.  Man I can not wait until the next book come out.

I have never been in abusive situation.  But I have known people that have been.  You always ask, &quot;Why do you stay?&quot;  But after reading this book I finally got the answer.  Eric just was a very awful man with problems within his self.  Poor Ruth, she was just his punching bag.  How can you claim you love someone and treat them badly like he did.  Things he done was very uncalled for.  Then when Ruth finally got out of the situation with Eric (husband), and finally got the nerve to meet someone, Adrian walks in here life, then out.  I felt so sorry for Ruth, but Adrian had nerve.  I understand he wanted to be a father to his child, but there are other ways to handle the sistuation.  I think he was just being selfish there.  I don't know if I could had forgiven Adrian and took him back or not.  Something to think about.  Get the book!	2004-05-03
