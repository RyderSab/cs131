This new art book shows how others in the art world have viewed Madonna throughout her career. There are sketches, water colors, oils, and works from many other mediums with the artist's unique view on who (or in some cases, what) Madonna is. <br /> <br />If you love art, or love Madonna, this is the book for you. And it makes a perfect gift as well!	2004-10-26

I belong to several book groups and have purchased a copy of this book for each of them! It is fun, interesting, easy to read and the recipes are a fun addition. Loved the suggested readings, the question lists for books, and the colorful book quotes that are scattered throughout the recipes and text.

William Pryor, Darwin's great-great grandson grew up in a world of priveldge that few will ever comprehend. Yet he felt empty and his search for fulfilment and identity took him into the world of hardcore drug addiction at the height of the beatnik movement. He 'hung out' with some of the biggest names in rock and roll forever searching for the illusive answers. When he finally hit rock bottom, and opted for a 'clean' life he found at least a portion of the identity he had been seeking. His recovery has allowed him to build a successful business career as a renowned entrepreneur in Britain and gives him the right to discuss drug-addiction and recovery from a vantage point that few of us ever want to know. This book should be required reading by all those in the recovery field and anyone who was ever baffled by the illure of illicet drugs.	2004-01-30

Unfortunately all I 'heard' was an angry woman shouting about how unjust her life is. While obviously articulate and intelligent, Ms Aseel's own voice is what turned me off about the book. Rather than offer suggestions or alternatives to what she sees as areas of difficulty between the American and Afghan cultures, she seems to prefer the approach that if you shout loudly enough, someone else will come up with a solution. I didn't end up learning anything new and her shouting failed to sway me to her viewpoint. I was greatly disappointed.	2003-07-02

The Situation Room truly is the &quot;Nerve Center&quot; for the country - both in times of crisis and in peace time. It is a central briefing room for the President, and a contact center for countries around the globe. Before reading this wonderful book, I hadn't thought about how calls to heads-of-state were made on behalf of the President, but now I can see why they would all go through the Situation Room.<br />If you are a fan of political movies, and want to know the truth behind the Hollywood fiction, or are just a political junkie, then this truly is the one book you want on your shelf!	2003-04-15

It explains far more than our media ever could about how the hatred we see in the eyes of those Islamic groups came to be, and why America and the West are the targets of their hatred. Many of his fellow Islamics consider Osama bin Laden to be their version of our Revolutionary era leaders - leading them in a just and holy war against a tyrannical government. Yet we see them as \\"radicals\\" and \\"terrorists\\". If you want a fascinating look at both sides of an issue that will dominate our news and lives for years to come, you cannot do better that Anonymous' \\"Through Our Enemies Eyes\\". Here's hoping our own government leaders will read it and absorb some of the knowlege that this book imparts!!!	2002-07-25

Not meant as a serious treatise on English history, it is a look at sites south of London and what is worth seeing and what you should skip. These two ladies obviously are having a great deal of fun with their writing, and when you pair this with their earlier book on Medieval and Tudor London, you have a fun, light-hearted look at one of the best places to tour on vacation - merry ol' England!	2002-07-15

Yet as I read it, I found myself uncovering ideas and philosophies I didn't even realize I held! So I purchased the book, and have since gone through each chapter and exercise and find that I have learned a great deal about myself, my beliefs and attitudes.

Well written and engrossing, Wes Fox has lived a life that all of us, let alone Marines, should aspire to live. If this is an example of the type of individual the Marines produce, than we should encourage more to enlist.

I saw a copy of this at a friend's office and had to get one of my own! Far more detailed than any of the annual sports magazine's college football issues, Blue Ribbon gives plenty of ink and detail to each of the major colleges.

With 25 years of perspective, some memories have tempored, while others burn as hot as they did then. A fascinating read - especially for those who were not old enough to understand the state of the world at the time.
