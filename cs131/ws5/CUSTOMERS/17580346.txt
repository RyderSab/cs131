There, his mandate was to promote both environmental conservation and poverty alleviation. While his memoir gives some fascinating insights into the NGO world and sketches of life in Liberia (including the unscrupulous dealings of multinational timber companies), this is ultimately a story of personal development. <br /> <br />A strength of Powers's story is that he is straightforward. Many memoirs seem intent on justifying the author's intent or actions. (An annoying example of that is the still-worthwhile The Economist's Tale, by Peter Griffiths, about economic advising in Sierra Leone.) Here, Powers willingly presents aspects of his story that some might consider inappropriate or at least in need of justification (such as taking a Liberian girlfriend with no long-term intentions or getting involved with environmental activists) and lets the reader judge. <br /> <br />He is also honest about difficult questions he faces. He arrives in Liberia and then leaves Liberia still struggling to find the balance between eliminating dependency and showing compassion. And although he struggles, we see genuine growth over the course of the two years. Upon arrival, he wrings his hands over Liberian dependency on aid to the point of being annoying. (Quite annoying.) But by the end of his stay, he has made serious headway in encouraging self-sufficiency (at least in certain communities) by supplementing local knowledge with Western technical insights. <br /> <br />One drawback is that we learn relatively little about the actual work he does. He gives us glimpses here and there, but since most of the book is his personal journey, we know only fragments of his experience learning to work with and learn from local leaders. He does introduce us to some fascinating colleagues: a wise conservationist and refugee camp worker named Gabriel, a jaded long-term aid worker namedThe Jacket, and a working Liberian single mother who cares about both providing for her family and improving her country. <br /> <br />Ultimately, this isn't a book about development, but about Westerners trying to do development. That said, many Westerners (myself included) try to do or at least understand development, and for us, Powers's journey is instructive. <br /> <br />For a book on a related theme, read Robert Klitgaard's excellent Tropical Gangsters, in which he recounts his work as an economic consultant in Equatorial Guinea. Klitgaard is weathered in his work and thus presents less of a personal journey and more of a clear picture of government functioning and both efforts and challenges to improving people's lives through official channels. Another enjoyable aid memoir (and this is one is very short), much less in depth than Powers' or Klitgaard's (but a wonderful read), is Dear Exile, by Liftin and Montgomery, which recounts Montgomery's experience in the Peace Corps in Kenya.	2005-10-08

Christopher Boone is an autistic savant with brilliant mathematical abilities but serious difficulty with emotional understanding. He tells the story from his perspective. As such, he supplements the narrative with expositions of his favorite probability and mathematics problems or his fascination with order and familiarity. Christopher's detours into his thoughts and his world help us truly come to know and care about him. This is one of the book's greatest strengths: as a reader, I found myself truly concerned for Christopher's welfare at points, wishing I could intervene. (Perhaps that will make me more likely to intervene when faced with those situations in reality.) And yet, observing his behavior, I can also begin to understand the frustrated reactions that his parents sometimes manifest. <br /> <br />The story is gripping. For several days, I couldn't put the book down, anxious to learn the answers to both the initial mystery (who killed a neighbor's dog?) and the other mysteries that are uncovered along the way. The book is also visually engaging: Christopher intersperses the text with diagrams and drawings to effectively convey his thoughts. <br /> <br />Overall, this book was a pleasurable read with significant substance. <br /> <br />Note to readers who care about this sort of thing: the book has a fair amount of strong language and references to extramarital relationships (which is a euphemism that Christopher wouldn't like, since we all have extramarital relationships, just not the kind I'm referring to here).	2005-10-05

Barasch's greatest strength is that he succeeds in making you think hard about compassion. As I read the book, I felt more inclined to give, to smile, to be kind. He inspired me to look up Soren Kierkegaard's Works of Love, which demands compassion, and the words of a certain Colombian priest, who seeks reconciliation. He provides a hundred different aphorisms on compassion, and sometimes an aphorism is all you need to remember to be kind: Philo of Alexandria said, \\"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle\\"; William Blake wrote, \\"He who would do Good for another must do it in Minute Particulars.\\" He provides examples from so many religious traditions and walks of life that it's hard to exclude yourself.    The only drawbacks of the book are, perhaps, strengths that are drawn out too long. He fills the prose with references to pop culture (Teletubbies and the tv program ER, for example) and lots of little jokes. Sometimes these feel a bit much, but it's not much of a flaw.    The book is strongest when Barasch describes his own experiences. He spends ten days on a homeless retreat, living on the streets of Denver. He experiments with tonglen meditation, in which you breathe in the suffering in the world and breathe out peace. He seeks to reconcile with a friend who brought him financial ruin. He observes a camp that brings together Israeli and Palestinian young women.    The first science chapter was less compelling (chapter 2), in which he provides evidence that compassion is a part of our evolutionary heritage (drawing on a host of primate behaviors). The other science coverage is intriguing, though. For example, he elucidates certain experiments that show cosmic connections between two human hearts focused on each other and (this is the best experiment in the whole book, chapter 13) that even a bowl of yogurt can feel your pain. (Not ajoke.)    Barasch clearly loves language: he kept me running for the dictionary throughout (what's a dudgeon? a homunculus?). But ultimately, this book succeeds because it reminds you of a hundred ways in which you might be compassionate yourself.	2005-09-29

I read Tuesdays with Morrie and thoroughly enjoyed the insights into listening to and caring about others. Albom did an effective job of culling out those parts of Morrie's advice that applied most readily to those of us who don't feel that our deaths are imminent. <br /> <br />\\"Morrie: In His Own Words\\" feels like Schwartz is very directly addressing those who are in the last stages of life, although he invites the rest of us to listen in. He gives practical advice for coming to terms with your diagnosis, dealing with well-meaning family and friends, and making your final months meaningful. <br /> <br />Of course, much of the advice applies to all of us. \\"It's not too late to develop new friendships or reconnect with people.\\" \\"It's not to late to...ask yourself if you really are the person you want to be, and if not, who you do want to be.\\" These important reminders helped me ask myself those questions, and any book that encourages introspection deserves consideration. <br /> <br />This book is poignant, practical, and short; and I would give it without reservation to a close friend approaching death. For those whose deaths have not been diagnosed, though, I might stick with Tuesdays with Morrie.	2005-09-25

Be aware, though, that you need a little bit of biological background to keep them from sliding right out the other end. As a complete neophyte to biology (I've taken nothing since a general education course in college), I found parts of Thomas's book difficult to access. Much of the vocabulary, probably rudimentary to those familiar with the field, was foreign to me. <br /> <br />That said, Thomas was able to teach even me a few things. I learned about the close relationship between mitochondria and bacteria and some interesting experiments relating to pheromones. In a truly fascinating chapter on mythical hybrid beasts (like the sphinx), he introduces some real creatures that seem just as otherworldly. One of his favorite topics is the social nature of humans and of other animals: several essays deal with this to interesting effect (although it does start to seem...familiar). <br /> <br />This would probably be a delightful book for a biologist, and it was a fair book for me. (Edward Lewis does an acceptable job reading the unabridged audio version, lending energy to the endeavor.)	2005-09-22
US	17580346	R3G97QLIQTZEKX	1555974198	509051043	Dictionary Days	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Meandering but insightful exploration of an adoring love of words	Dr. Samuel Johnson, in his 1755 dictionary of the English language, defined an \\"essay\\" as \\"not a regular and orderly composition.\\" Stavans, in this collection of essays on dictionaries and words, is consistent in his adherence to that definition, if nothing else. The author explores the history of dictionaries across languages and cultures, the exclusion of \\"cacophonous words\\" (i.e., swear words), the inclusion of cultural biases, and more general thoughts on language and thought. Sometimes fascinating, sometimes taxing, Stavans takes us on a ride through a mind fascinated (and perhaps obsessed) by words. <br /> <br />Interesting vignettes fill the book. We learn that Founding Father John Adams predicted the ultimate dominance of English as a world language, why \\"African\\" was excluded from the original Oxford English Dictionary and \\"American\\" was not, and how a severed arm (not his) inspired Stavans to write. The author gives us examples of humorous mistakes in dictionaries gone by: for example, a 1967 Spanish dictionary defines a day as \\"the space of time needed by the Sun to completely round the Earth.\\"  <br /> <br />Stavans is creative: in one chapter he retells a dream, in another he recounts an imagined visit by the 18th-century lexicographer Samuel Johnson to the author's Massachusetts home, and in a third he explores cross-cultural linguistic challenges through the story of an illegal immigrant from El Salvador. He spends most of one essay ruminating on a certain swear word and whether its exclusion from many lexicons is right or wise. We read passages in Latin, Greek, Yiddish, and Spanish. The book has an all-star cast, with quotes from Neruda, Flaubert, Carroll, Shakespeare, Conrad, and the musical Singing in the Rain, and allusions to many more (Milton, Pope, Swift, and Kafka among them). <br /> <br />Yet, the essays often lack coherence, evoking the feeling of a stream of consciousness, with lines like \\"Ink + reason = power,\\" and \\"Ink is playful, whereasInc. denotes consent.\\" These are fine musings, but they are not well explained or reasoned. The author also tosses out strong opinions without strong backing. For example, a diatribe against the lack of books on language at large chain bookstores culminates with, \\"The lack of respect for books in these so-called Temples of Knowledge is obscene.\\" It's not clear who claimed this lofty title for the espresso-serving bookmarts. <br /> <br />Even though the meandering narrative wore me down, the essays are ultimately effective. As he praised the dictionary, he sent me running for my own, time and time again, to look up \\"encaustic,\\" \\"tergiversation,\\" \\"onomastic,\\" \\"palliative.\\" He reminded me of how fun the thesaurus can be; I laughed at the suggested alternatives for \\"disaster\\" for a report I was writing on natural disasters: \\"hard luck,\\" \\"hot water,\\" \\"cataclysm.\\" Stavans' passion for words and their home is infectious, and that may be reason enough to enjoy this fun, light collection.	2005-09-19

The tale is fascinating, and the film based on the book (while excellent in its own way) is a mere shadow of the actual events. <br /> <br />Perhaps one of the reasons the film was a loose representation is that John Nash, early in his life, is not a very sympathetic character. He is arrogant, obnoxious, and smart enough to get away with it as a young mathematician. He fathers a child out of wedlock and refuses to marry the mother or support the child. And yet, as Nasar takes us into the delusions that gradually tear his life apart, she effectively elicits sympathy, first for his family, but then for the man himself. Then, she conveys the wonderful hope that comes as his schizophrenia goes into remission and he is able to resume something of a normal life. <br /> <br />Along the path, Nasar gives us fascinating detail on a host of topics related to Nash's life. She provides a history of the Nobel Prize in economics and all the controversy that has surrounded it, the background behind Princeton's illustrious Institute for Advanced Learning and Santa Monica's RAND Corporation, and she takes us inside many of the key mathematical problems that Nash struggled with (and sometimes solved). Nasar does not underestimate the ability of her audience. <br /> <br />This is a powerful tale of tragedy, hope, family, and the wonder of the intellect.

She repays them with her wonderful powers of listening which inspire arguers to resolve their fights, storytellers to tell wondrous stories, and children to play exciting games. Soon, though, a group of strange men begin to steal people's time, causing them to work constantly, feverishly, and mirthlessly. Momo must save the day.<br /><br />My wife and I began reading this aloud and stopped because of the slow exposition. But as I continued on my own, the pace picked up, and I was treated to an adventure into the origins of time and back again.<br /><br />The book has several strengths. Ende draws his characters with wonderful detail: Momo and her friends are drawn with painstaking detail (sometimes too much, maybe, but ultimately with benefit). The moral of the tale, that time enjoyed is not time wasted, is a valuable if simple reminder to all of us in our rushed world. A secondary theme, established early in the book, points to the powerful value of listening to others, another valuable reminder. (As an aside, my favorite book on that theme is Mitch Albom's Tuesdays with Morrie.) As Momo journeys to the origin of time, Ende employs evocative imagery to help us visualize a physical manifestation of time.<br /><br />I look forward to recommending this title to my children and to other young readers.	2005-09-13

It is also quite violent. (I don't know what I expected, but be warned: this isn't kid stuff.) <br /> <br />Batman comes out of retirement as he sees Gotham City falling into the hands of criminals even though he's now quite old to be engaging in hand-to-hand combat with jokers and mutants. His escapades are interspersed with coverage of Gotham's media debating his value (Criminal or Hero?). Many of the media and political personalities have striking resemblances to figures in our own world, both visually and verbally. <br /> <br />Towards the end, we have a showdown between Batman and Superman, a fascinating opposition since their antagonism is over means, not ends. Miller et al. use the medium to its fullest, employing different colored speech bubbles for different characters to minimize confusion in the midst of all the action. <br /> <br />This was well executed, and I recommend it. (Three stars because I didn't love it, even though I found it well worth my time.)	2005-09-03

The book starts off slow, with a detailed history of the Smith family moving from place to place. The first two chapters have a few too many lists describing each town: \\"An 1824 gazeteer credited the town with three gristmills, eight sawmills, one fulling mill, an iron works, five distilleries...\\" (p. 45). <br /> <br />But the book picks up halfway through chapter two, when we encounter Joseph Smith's first spiritual manifestation. Bushman deals with the spiritual events perfectly: he describes them in the words of the individuals who experience the events, and then he provides extensive cultural context. For example, he explains that the negative reaction of local clergy to Joseph's first vision may well have been because others claimed similar visions around the same time, often justifying a departure in doctrine from established religion. He explains that while Joseph Smith did have a seerstone, such objects were not uncommon among the mixture of magic and religion that prevailed in the day. <br /> <br />The book is wonderfully documented, and many of the footnotes in the back provide additional insights. The book also provides sources for certain stories that I have heard circulating in the LDS Church without knowing where they came from. For example, David Whitmer is our source for the story of Joseph Smith being unable to translate while being annoyed at his wife (p. 104). <br /> <br />The chronology of events is occasionally confusing because Bushman discusses everything about the Book of Mormon and then jumps back in time as he treats everything about the organization of the Church, but this is a minor (and probably unavoidable) drawback. This book is an informative and inspiring read, and I'm glad to have it as a reference in my collection. I look forward to reading Bushman's full biography of Joseph Smith, due out in September 2005.	2005-08-29

Gladwell shows us otherwise as he illustrates his basic hypothesis with social psychology experiments. His hypothesis is that social phenomena behave like disease epidemics: an idea reaches a certain critical mass (or \\"tipping point\\"), after which it quickly spreads to the rest of the population. <br /> <br />Here are some of the experiments that Gladwell recounts: psychologists staged emergencies in different situations to see who would come and help, finding that people were less likely to call for help if more people were observing the emergency; psychologists found that asking students to nod while listening to a radio editorial about raising tuition made them markedly more likely to believe tuition should be raised; two Princeton psychologists found that seminarians were MUCH less likely to help someone in need if they'd been told they needed to hurry (independent of whether they had read the parable of The Good Samaritan previous to the experiment). <br /> <br />Gladwell uses this interesting research to support nuances of his story that three types of people bring about these social epidemics: mavens, connectors, and salesmen. He provides illustrative anecdotes about each type. <br /> <br />While Gladwell doesn't prove his hypothesis with any scientific rigor, he provides excellent intuition and the social experiments he describes along the way make it worth the ride. <br /> <br />He also gives us the experiment that gave rise to the idea of Six Degrees of Separation, a detailed study of why Blue's Clues is a better children's show (but more boring for parents) than Sesame Street, and much, much more.	2005-08-26

Brown owns a hotel in Haiti, where he hosts Mr. & Mrs. Smith as they seek to build a vegetarian center sponsored by the government. Together, they catch glimpses of the elusive Jones, who is consistent only in constantly changing what he appears to be. <br /> <br />Greene successfully highlights the terror of the Duvalier regime in Haiti and the mythology that arose around it. He draws on characters that could be stereotypical (the idealistic Smith, the opportunistic Jones, and the realistic Brown) but manages to give them enough personality to feel real. As he does so, he explores what it means to be truly genuine, to care for a cause, and what ideals are worth fighting for (and how it makes sense to fight for them). <br /> <br />This novel is thought-provoking, engaging, and provides an important glimpse of history.	2005-08-18

He and his son (Haroun) travel to some distant (and very imaginative) lands to restore that ability, learning in the process that even made-up stories can reflect truth. In these faraway places, they meet individuals with remarkable similarities to characters they met at home, evocative of the movie adaptation of The Wizard of Oz (but not the book). Rushdie's clever use of language brings a smile and employs both English and Hindustani. For example, one land in the book champions stories, and all the pages (referring to royal servants) in the army of that land wear numbered rectangular uniforms with text from famous books, like pages of a book. In the same spirit (but in a different language), the princess of that land is named Batcheat (from Hindustani `baat-cheet' which means `chit-chat'). <br /> <br />My wife and I read this aloud and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book gives empathy to all those who love stories. It went quickly and would also be fun for younger readers. Rushdie includes, at the end of the text, an appendix \\"About the Names in this Book,\\" which gives insight on the names drawn from Hindustani.	2005-08-09

Hiaasen includes a fair amount of humor along the way. About halfway through, it felt as if we were coming to the climax, but Hiaasen managed to shift gears and string us along for a bit longer to good effect. <br /> <br />Roy is a good kid but not a goody-two-shoes; I'd be happy for my kids to read a story with him as the hero. In the course of the book, we also meet a very badly behaved kid, and we realistically see him as the product of his unsupportive home environment. This book is about families as much as anything else; we see how some parents love and support their kids and others are more self-serving. <br /> <br />My wife and I listened to this together and both enjoyed it.

I hadn't encountered many of the ideas previously, such as putting the importance material at the end of the sentence and only elaborate one of the three parts of a sentence (i.e. the subject, the verb, or the object).<br /><br />Two strengths of the book are that it's funny (my friends couldn't believe I was laughing aloud at a style manual) and that it gives a host of references to other books on writing. On McClosky's recommendation, one of my next books will be Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Her main list of writing books is on pages 8 and 9, but she peppers recommendations throughout. She also gives a list of good economics writers (p. 15).<br /><br />I didn't agree with everything in the book because, after all, \\"good style is...a matter of taste\\" (p. 88). If you want axioms, go to Strunk and White's Elements of Style (which is also wittier than you might expect). But McCloskey takes us beyond axioms to think hard about style and the process is well worth our while. (\\"Process\\" is one of her no-no words (p. 73), but I'll leave it, just this once.)	2005-07-16

His ethnographic analysis provides a powerful complement to standard epidemiological work, and this treatise on the danger as well as the immorality of inequity in medical care is largely convincing.    Farmer illustrates several broad themes effectively with case studies from Haiti and Peru. One is the idea that most studies overemphasize individual agency, failing to recognize serious \\"structural\\" factors, such as the pressure that extreme poverty exerts on people to engage in unhealthy behaviors and the problems introduced by economic inequality. (One example of the latter is that in unequal countries like Peru, second-line TB drugs are available because of demand by the rich, so doctors also prescribe them to the poor who can only afford them intermittently, which generates drug-resistant strains of the disease.) Another theme is that people in rich nations tend to place heavy weight on \\"strange\\" cultural beliefs and customs in explaining high disease prevalence, whereas actual epidemiological research tends to show that these factors carry little weight relative to poverty-related factors. While he uses AIDS in Haiti to illustrate this tendency, it applies perfectly to popular Western conceptions of AIDS in Africa: the popular media tend to emphasize cultural practices such as wife inheritance and a strong sex drive, whereas epidemiological research fails to support a major role for these.    A third theme, which Farmer often trumpets but not as convincingly, is that many of the trade-offs voiced by policymakers are ultimately false. One example is the question of whether to treat tuberculosis with drugs or prevent it (e.g., by investing in economic development). He then uses the success of his clinic in Haiti as an example of both treating and preventing TB. The ultimate argument is that the wealthy have no right to withhold their wealth from the poor. However, he gives us no clear sense of how the resources to generalize this to the world at large should be marshaled. While the trade-off may be philosophically false, the practical application is unclear.    But even without a plan of action, Farmer illuminates key problems in the analysis of infectious disease spread and makes a convincing plea to share the wealth (and the technology).	2005-07-11

He then tells us stories about coming to the USA, making it into Hollywood, his experience with racism and civil rights, his reflections on life and spirituality, and the making of his movies. The book is a little uneven: I loved his stories about getting started in acting and making his films, while I got impatient with some of his thoughts on the nature of the world. But overall, this memoir is insightful and entertaining. <br /> <br />He provides an engaging narrative of the Civil Rights Movement from the perspective of black artists in show business. He gives a powerful example as he tells the story of refusing a film because it would have betrayed the values that his father taught him, and of how that refusal ultimately led to his Hollywood career taking off. He also entertains with anecdotes about his experiences with Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Harry Belafonte, Carl Sagan, and many others. Shortly after watching his film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, I read the story of how that film got made and enjoyed the insight that story provided. <br /> <br />Along the way, Poitier shares some wonderful insights about life and culture, progress and overconsumption.  <br /> <br />If you have any opportunity to listen to this book on tape, I recommend it. Poitier reads the entire book himself, and his voice and intonation would make this worth listening to even if the memoir were less good than it is.	2005-07-09

With that marvelous machine, Dahl leaves behind any creative inhibition and sends the whole family up to outer space, where they meet some very scary characters (e.g., the Vermicious Knids, whom I found particularly scary as a young reader). In the second part of the book, the family returns to earth, and Mr. Wonka uses some of his most impressive inventions to coax Charlie's three bedridden grandparents back to their feet so they can help in the chocolate factory. <br /> <br />This book is full of silly fun, from the former nanny of the President of the United States (who is now a most overbearing vice-president) to a bizarre journey to minusland (the place people go when they are under zero years old). <br /> <br />The lack of a strong plot makes it much less compelling than the previous book. My wife and I read the book aloud, and we were much more likely to put the book down and not pick it up for a while. But I enjoyed all the wacky adventures as well as the Dahl's trademark portrayal of adults at their worst.	2005-07-09

Enzio Busche recounts the spiritual experiences that led him to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as many experiences since his conversion. His humble and powerful example truly inspires rededication to God. Elder Busche (as members of the Church in his position are called) lets his experiences speak for themselves in teaching the importance of dedicating our lives to God, serving others in charity and love. He minimizes editorializing on the stories, recognizing that they teach better than any summarized moral conclusion could. <br /> <br />The first ten chapters of the book give the narrative of his conversion and early membership in the Church. As a young father, I found chapter nine (\\"Raising a Family\\") particularly insightful in showing how love, respect, and being prepared for inspiration can help us lead our children in good directions. Several of the later chapters are dedicated to recounting spiritual experiences that others shared with Elder Busche, and many of these reminded me that I often aim too low in my spiritual expectations. An example of this is in chapter fourteen, in which a woman visiting Salt Lake City from Eastern Europe tells Elder Busche, \\"Can you imagine? I have found people in Salt Lake City who have never seen an angel.\\" <br /> <br />Almost every chapter of this book, especially once I reached the beginning of Elder Busche's spiritual life in chapter four, left me pondering how I could reorient my life towards God and draw closer to Him. <br /> <br />Another excellent spiritual memoir by a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is An Abundant Life: The Memoirs of Hugh B. Brown, edited by Edwin Firmage.	2005-07-02

For that latter quality, I recommend it. [Examples of babble: \\"Any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things,\\" and \\"If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil.\\" What?] <br /> <br />The fundamental message of the book is that you should discover your \\"personal calling\\" (as Coelho calls it in his introduction) and not be afraid to pursue it. This shepherd encounters all sorts of obstacles, yet he seems eventually remembers (or is reminded of) his goal and continues to pursue it. As I read, I found myself reflecting on my own personal calling and whether I am still on the meandering road that pursues it. I would like to be reminded to reflect on that more often. <br /> <br />In tone, the book vaguely evokes Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet but without being nearly as directly meaningful nor as poetic. Towards the beginning, I felt the same cheesiness that repelled me in Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven, but Coelho thankfully tones it down several notches.	2005-07-02

Be warned: he writes the book in the language of the self-help genre, with phrases such as \\"this is a different way of thinking about books, and the results can be transforming,\\" or \\"uncovering the books that will change your life.\\" But aside from the self-help language that occasionally induces eye-rolling, Leveen provides truly valuable counsel. For more literary homages to the love of reading (but with less advice), see Anne Fadiman's Ex Libris or Anna Quindlen's How Reading Changed My Life; both are wonderful. <br /> <br />Beyond the basic suggestions to write in the margins of your books and to join a book club, Leveen gives some suggestions that I found novel and have already implemented, such as putting together a list (or a collection) of books that are candidates for future reading, grouped by subject. This way, you never have to wonder what to read next or settle for a mediocre option because you can't remember all those books you really wanted to read. He also culls suggestions (from a variety of books) on how to retain more from reading. <br /> <br />Particularly helpful were chapter 1 (on choosing what to read) and especially chapter 2 (on getting more out of what you read). Chapter 3 is essentially a lengthy infomercial on the value of audio books; chapter 4 is an infomercial for book clubs. Chapter 5 tells us how wonderful reading is and summarizes the earlier portions. <br /> <br />Ideas from those initial chapters have already improved the quality of my own reading.	2005-07-02

First, he provides a compelling narrative of the epidemic itself, replete with first-hand accounts of witnesses. Then, he tells us something of what happened in Philadelphia after this particular epidemic, illuminating the important impacts this event had on such diverse aspects of life as a public water system and whether the U.S. President can call Congress outside of the capital city.  <br /> <br />He goes on to explain the unfortunately major role of yellow fever as a U.S. killer for over a century. We then learn how scientists eventually discovered the cause (mosquitos carrying the virus) and a vaccine. <br /> <br />Murphy's inclusion of relevant details adds to the evocative account of the tragedy itself. For example, we feel the irony when - in the midst of doctors and quacks expounding a range of potential ways to avoid the fever - an unknown author submits a letter to a newspaper suggesting that city residents kill the mosquitoes hatching in their yards. The remedy is not heeded. Likewise, in the midst of the panic that the epidemic created, a meteorite actually lands in the middle of the city, adding to the apocalyptic frenzy. <br /> <br />This book is an excellent introduction to the importance of public health issues in U.S. and world history. I sent a copy as a gift to a young friend with a taste for history today. <br /> <br />(Special note on the audio version narrated by Pat Bottino: he sounds too much like sportscaster Howard Cosell for my taste, with every sentence delivered as a sharp staccato.)	2005-06-24

I've already re-told several of the stories to friends, who have enjoyed them. (Two favorites are the first story, about a guinea fowl who becomes the child of a childless woman; and one about a turtle farmer and a snail trader whose friendship falls upon hard times.)    These stories would be wonderful to read aloud to children, and in addition to the suspense and action of the stories, the distinctness from most American stories is interesting: animals turn into people and trees grow out of a man's head, all without explanation. Whereas American stories would have to attribute these events to magic (or wacky science), the folk magic here is assumed. These stories also have strong morals, from the superficial (Don't reject your daughter, even if she's smelly) to the more fundamental (People who trick others out of money pay in the end).    I heartily recommend the audio version of this book, which has several excellent readers including Lisette Lecat (who reads the audio versions of The Ladies' Number One Detective Agency books and Alexandra Fuller's books).	2005-06-22

After reading this and The Kite Runner (a novel that also deals with Afghanistan), I have a basic sense of the nation and culture. <br /> <br />Seierstad does many things right that make this a compelling account. She devotes at least a chapter to members of the family at very different parts of life: the household head, a middle-aged bookseller; his widowed mother, now with little power at home; a young girl, powerless over her marital choices and busy from before dawn to late at night with household chores. In the course of the 300+ pages, we get a picture of what life is like for all these people and others. Seierstad, in the foreward, makes clear the fact that this isn't a \\"representative\\" Afghan family (whatever that is), but at the very least it is a real Afghan family, and the author successfully makes them real to us. <br /> <br />We also get a basic sense of modern Afghan history and what life was like under the Taliban, although most of the book takes place after the Taliban were overthrown. Finally, we become acquainted with a few tenets of Islam that we might not have known previously, such a key difference between Sunni and Shi'a muslims and the different between that which is permitted (halal) and that which is forbidden (haram). <br /> <br />My only critique is that the book is occasionally uneven. Some stories, such as when one of Sultan's employees is accused of stealing, are very compelling, whereas others seemed to drag. But this likely will vary with the individual interests of the reader.	2005-06-18

This is an excellent foil to the commonly circulating pessimism regarding the aid industry. (For an over-the-top example of that, see Graham Hancock's Lords of Poverty.) Drawing on both well-documented secondary sources and on interviews with key players in the cases, the authors make convincing arguments for causality between the intervention and the health improvement in most of the cases. <br /> <br />This book's strongest contribution is that it introduces the reader to important public health problems in the developing world and then shows how some of those problems can be solved. The book provides both an introduction to the science of the diseases (and their cures) and basic information about effective administration of large-scale public health interventions. <br /> <br />Some of the chapters that I thought were particularly important include Chapter 1 (Eradicating Smallpox), because it deals with a serious disease that was rampant (in 1966, it killed in over 50 countries) and has now been completely eradicated; Chapter 2 (Preventing HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections in Thailand), because AIDS is currently such an insidious disease, and successful examples of its control are essential; Chapter 6 (Controlling Onchocerciasis in Sub-Saharan Africa), because it shows the importance of and potential for strong leadership (including that of Robert McNamara, then president of the World Bank) and cooperation between organizations; and Chapter 8 (Improving the Health of the Poor in Mexico), because it gives the background for a development strategy that is currently growing in popularity and will probably be seen much more in the future. (That strategy consists of giving cash transfers to poor families, conditional on their complying with certain conditions, such as vaccinating their children and enrollingthem in school.) <br /> <br />The authors also draw certain key lessons and give examples to illustrate. For example, they emphasize the importance of ongoing commitment, both from government leaders and international organizations. They give one example of a case in which the success of an intervention ironically threatened exactly that commitment (Chapter 11 - Controlling Chagas Disease) and another in which many players have shown impressive longevity of effort (Chapter 6 - Controlling Onchocerciasis in Sub-Saharan Africa). <br /> <br />Be warned that the book reads like a textbook, and some chapters are definitely stronger than others (both in their writing and in how strong the case is made for the effectiveness of the intervention). With that minor caveat, this is an important contribution and a worthy read.	2005-06-07

Her tangents are insightful and resonate with the trends I see in reading; for example, she characterizes the shift from reading for pleasure to reading for purpose: \\"whereas an executive might learn far more from Moby Dick ..., the book he was expected to have read might be The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People [sic]\\". I loved and identified with her descriptions of growing up obsessed with reading, having spent most childhood afternoons among the stacks of the local public library.  <br /> <br />This isn't as good as Anne Fadiman's Ex Libris (on the same topic), but it's thoughtful and quick. (I read it in about two hours.) She specifically deals with why she believes women read more than men.

Fadiman convincingly makes the case that neither side is inherently at fault (although occasionally I cringe at a word or action on each side) but that the problem stems from \\"cross-cultural misunderstanding.\\" <br /> <br />She delivers a satisfying mixture of telling the story of Lia Lee (the child with epilepsy) and of giving a broader view of Hmong history and culture. (I had no idea that the Hmong were recruited by the CIA to fight for the USA in Laos during the Vietnam war, for example.) <br /> <br />Another strength of the book is that Fadiman looks within the field of medical anthropology and actually finds suggestions and solutions for this problem. Make sure, even if you decide some of the history isn't for you, that you don't miss chapters 17 (The Eight Questions) and 18 (The Life or the Soul), as they do an excellent job of transforming an interesting narrative into an instructive case study. <br /> <br />As a side note, I read this while in the hospital recovering from malaria and was gratified to find that several doctors and nurses had read the book or at least parts of it. I strongly recommend this book.  <br /> <br />Another excellent book by the same author is Ex Libris: Confessions of a Common Reader, which is a light collection of essays on the love of books and reading. It's completely different territory, but Fadiman really shows her versatility.	2005-05-30

This book tells a powerful story that led me to reflect on redemption and forgiveness. And it's refreshing to read a tragic tale with a not-entirely-tragic ending, reminding us that redemption does exist in the world. Be warned that some very disturbing events take place in these pages; I think it's worth the ride, but it's not without cost. A side benefit is that we get a brief overview of Afghan history since the 1970s.    My mild criticism is that we come across a few too many coincidences of old \\"friends\\" reappearing, neatly tying the story together. And the ending worked well for me but not perfectly. But these are small potatoes; this a very good novel.	2005-05-30

I listened to an audio version, and I was completely hooked from start to finish. Jack Foreman, our protagonist, is an unemployed (for reasons not his fault) computer programmer who gets called in to help solve the problem of a biotechnology company producing something in the desert. The something turns out to be a human-made technology that learns, reproduces, and is exceedingly dangerous! Lots of twists, turns, and red herrings make this a wonderful ride.     Occasionally, I got a little bogged down with the scientific explanations, but those are both the blessing and the curse of Crichton work (Airframe is another great thriller of his where I had similar feelings). I'm also never quite sure with Crichton how much of the science is real science and how much is...fiction. And Crichton's introduction about the dangers of messing with nature felt pretty heavy-handed. I have no doubt he's right, but it still felt a little paternalistic: if we don't do something soon, then something like what happened in my novel won't be so fictional after all. (I'm overstating, but this is the feel.) Overall, this was a great ride.	2005-05-21

The other part is a history of the role that US corporations (and, more subtly, the US government) play in eliminating hostile but strategically important leaders of developing countries and co-opting their nations' resources. (Those same leaders, hostile to US business, are often the champions of the poor in their countries.) <br /> <br />The history this book provides opened my eyes and made me want to read more on the subject. Thankfully, Perkins also provides extensive references for those who would like to read more on this, both providing an avenue for the curious reader and showing that he isn't the only witness to the new imperialism. The last few pages of the book also provide some practical suggestions for a reader to \\"do something\\" (and refuse to absolve us of collective guilt). <br /> <br />On the other hand, while the book claims to be a confession, massive page space is dedicated to Perkins's misgivings about what he was doing as he was doing it, to the point that it really feels like he's trying to let us know that he's not that bad a guy. That tone and the amount of time dedicated to it really wore me down as a reader. (Okay, okay, you were really torn, I get it.) <br /> <br />But overall, this was well worth the time, and I only hope I can carry some of its lessons with me.	2005-05-04

But his extreme rhetoric warns us that if there is a good side to aid, it certainly won't be represented here. Here's a sample of his accusations: \\"These lords of poverty are the druids of the modern era wielding enormous power that is accountable to no one.\\"    On the one hand, Hancock's anecdotal evidence is unconvincing. He tells us that his often-chilling anecdotes are representative, but we have no way of really knowing. That said, he provides so many anecdotes that - by the end - we start to feel like they are, if not representative of all aid, at least insightful into an uncomfortable proportion.    But the litany of anecdotes is also tiring. The writing is not particularly great, and I felt that some of the analysis was flawed. (For example, in two places he argues that Western nations don't give nearly enough in aid, but most of the book argues that everything we give is wasted anyway. It's not clear how giving more would help, given his theses.)     Eventually I tired of simply hearing one aid horror story after another. He also misses the fact that there have been some major successes in aid, particularly in the realm of public health, in which organizations like the World Bank and UNICEF have played a part. (To read about some of these successes, look at Millions Saved by Ruth Levine et al.)    I'm glad I read the book, but I wish Hancock had made it a little less exhausting and a little more balanced. I also wish we'd gotten more solutions in the end. His only solution is to dissolve the aid industry (as it is \\"inherently bad, bad to the bone, and utterly beyond reform\\"), after which we have the vague promise that \\"it will becomepossible for people to rediscover ways to `help' one another directly.\\"	2005-04-29

This is a fascinating account of an amazing struggle. Mandela effectively captures the paradoxes of leadership: means versus ends, ideology versus tactics. Mandela is a remarkable man, not because he is flawless (for he shows that he is not), but because he was not afraid to fight with all his might for something he believed in.

US	17580346	RD4RIPG6R5MKW	0440225701	454775948	The Street Lawyer	Books	2	0	1	N	N	fine but not very gripping	(Legal \\"thriller\\") A lawyer is taken hostage by a homeless guy and is inspired to start working with the homeless. He discovers dirt behind the hostage situation. Not the most thrilling thriller. Fine but pretty straightforward. Seems to be trying to teach people about homelessness.

Two detectives must pass through a whole series of cultural barriers to solve this mystery. Lots of twists and turns, but I didn't find it so amazing. Generally entertaining, but the language was too much for me.    Potentially offensive material: Continuous strong language, some violence and sex (brief but quite graphic)	2005-04-23
US	17580346	R2RCS5H2EX45M4	1400090598	505341703	Ella Enchanted	Books	3	1	5	N	N	fine	Ella of Frell was cursed at <br />birth with obedience: she has to follow any direct <br />order given to her by anyone. The book details <br />her mishaps, as well as her quest to break the <br />curse and find true love. This was way too girly <br />for me. Very much a Cinderella story (complete <br />with wicked step-relatives and a pumpkin coach) <br />with a new twist, kind-of-amusing twist. A young <br />girl might thoroughly enjoy this. Maybe? But perhaps the real problem was the squeaky narrator; just didn't do it for me.	2005-03-25

It was  wonderful to hear his process. I read many of his  books when I was younger and enjoyed them; it  was great to hear the foundations of some, as  well as King's tips on writing.

She gives some<br />good insights into Papua New Guinea, and she<br />also has some exciting internal discoveries that I<br />found moving and insightful.

Klitgaard provides a nice mix of stories  about day-to-day life anecdotes and how the  World Bank interacts with ministers of  government. He's also a very \\"groovy\\" guy,  jamming on the guitar with local pop stars and  continually searching for good waves.    Potentially offensive material: nothing serious	2005-03-25

She has a powerful story that illustrates  both something of Togo and the harsh realities of  how the US treats asylum seekers.  Also, the audio version, albeit abridged, has an  intro spoken by Fauziya herself, so the listener  gets to hear what she sounds like.

As always, Card is insightful and  I enjoy his thoughts on the human condition. But  his allusions to LDS stories are a little blatant for  me. And this story doesn't stand alone at all. It's  definitely written as the first in a series.    Potentially offensive material: nothing	2005-03-25
