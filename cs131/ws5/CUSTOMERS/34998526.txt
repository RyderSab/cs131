The reasons are not too difficult to comprehend.<br />&quot;What to expect when you're expecting&quot; covers many common aspects of pregnancy, starting from pregnancy tests, diet, and choices available to month-by-month development, symptoms and delivery. Heidi Murkoff explains in the introduction of the book how most pregnancy related books tend to scare and explain the worst rather than reassure and explain. So, this book has been written to reassure and calm down parents-to-be. The author just about meets her goals. Some readers like to be &quot;informed&quot; and want to know everything that is happening or can happen to them. They will love this book. Others can easily get scared, upset, or distressed. They would be well advised to skip the section &quot;When something goes wrong&quot; which is towards the end of the book.<br />The main attraction is the month-by-month question-answer format that explains what to expect, symptoms and concerns one may have during a particular month. The depth and breath of questions/answers change with each edition as the authors receive feedback from readers. Much of the information given here is available for free all over the Internet or from the doctor's office but this book consolidates in all this information at one place, which is quite helpful.<br />That being said, the cute title of the book tends to convey the impression that this book will comprehensively cover all aspects of pregnancy, which is not true. It only addresses the most common questions and concerns. It would have been really nice to see some pictures as well, which are lacking. Sometimes the tone tends to get way too reassuring, which can be dangerous.  E.g. in situations when you should follow your instinct and call the doctor but you become laid-back after reading the reassuring text. Also, sometimes the authors tend to make moms-to-be feel guilty about unintentionalor once-in-a-while indulgences in food of their choice.<br />The fact that this book is not written by a doctor does not take away anything from the helpful information it provides. But it also means that this book should be used as a supplement to rather than a replacement of your OBGYN's advice. This book should not be considered a bible and would be better read as a reference guide (with a grain of salt) instead of cover-to-cover. All in all this is a nice book that can be read by or recommended to the moms-to-be.<BR> <BR>Another book that is interesting and informative is &quot;The Girlfriend's Guide To Pregnancy&quot;.	2002-12-02

Unfortunately there is a glaring paucity of books for dads-to-be. There is no denying the fact that fathers should be involved in the pregnancy, should have as much information as possible and most long to have \\"their own book\\". But unlike pregnant women who can experience many common symptoms, men's symptoms/fears/feelings are difficult to pin down. They can range from anger and confusion to expectation and pure joy... and anything in between. No wonder it is an uphill task to write for fathers. It is therefore no surprise that the title of the book, \\"The Expectant Father\\", makes would-be parents rub their hands with glee.<br />If you are looking to understand the male psychology during pregnancy or if this is your first book or if you would like to so some surface grazing on the subject or if you are young and inexperienced, this book does cover some ground. It will give you some decent introduction on what she might be feeling, what you might be feeling and what is happening with the baby. It even gives some valuable tips to make pregnancy an enjoyable experience for all concerned.<br />If you are looking to understand the nuts and bolts (physical aspects) of pregnancy, \\"her books\\" would be a better choice. Those who have already been reading them would be disappointed with the pedantic tone of this book, psychological aspect notwithstanding. Years ago men were categorized as insensitive slobs who felt their masculinity threatened if they expressed themselves. Most men today understand that masculinity and sensitivity are not mutually exclusive. And that their nurturing instinct adds to rather than takes way from their personality. They are caring enough to use their instinct and common sense to have an open and supportive communication with their partner- which is essentially what the book advices.<br />This book is a good attempt but still leaves a lot to be desired.	2002-12-02

It is the birthplace of both Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism. It also has one of the world's oldest Jewish communities (though it is fast depleting thanks to emigration to Israel). The tolerance and acceptance of each other's very different beliefs is a part of the Indian psyche. Whatever one may read about religious violence in that country is more a result of manipulations by politicians than anything else.<br />This coffee-table format book offers a simplistic high-level introduction to the very complex subject of religions in India including Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Buddhism, Christianity, Jainism, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism- some more detailed than the other. It contains color photographs on every page. Rather than the photographs complementing the text, each text block describes a specific photograph. Some pictures and text associated with Hinduism are very region specific and are not a general representation of the religion. E.g. picture of the Bride and the practice described is very specific to Bengal state. This may be as much as 95% different for other brides, depending on the state. Since an attempt has been made to cover a very complex subject in a few pages, the result is surface grazing of the subject rather than deep insight or detailed treatment. The impact of religion on daily life is well represented and explained. This book by Lonely Planet is a decent starter book for introduction to various religions.	2002-11-23

While they adopted Indian customs, traditions and ideas, it was but inevitable that the native population would be also adopt some of the ways of their conquerors- the balance being subtly tilted in favor of the locals.<br />British were no exception. They warily started mingling their life and customs with those of Indians. Indian rulers too started to imitate their conquerors. The influence was clearly discernable in the hybrid architecture- influence of British and European architecture on Indian buildings and that of Indian architecture / style on British buildings.<br />Derry Moore first visited India in 1976. By that time, many of these once glorious buildings had become dilapidated relics of the past. He sensed that it was just a matter of time before the ravages of time and neglect by the owners would destroy them. This book contains the black and white pictures he took to preserve the record for posterity. He focused on certain areas in India. But once there, he photographed well-known palaces as well as other lesser-known buildings (including, in some cases, their inhabitants). The pictures clearly have an artistic touch even though there is something melancholy about them. The reader might have some difficulty relating to the pictures since none of them are accompanied by captions, which are given at the end. This book is suitable for those with special interest in India- historians, architects and others in similar league.	2002-10-28

In addition to some rare pictures of difficult moments of Indian history, important personalities who defined the political scene, he also captures the quintessence of everyday Indian life. His lens conveys his understanding and deep regard for this country.<br />This book also includes a very interesting article on Hinduism by Yves Vequaud because, as the author says, &quot;...many tourists who visit India today are still hidebound by the monotheism of their own religions and are apparently unreceptive to the philosophy which underlies a world very different from our own...&quot;<br />This book would an interesting addition to any collection. But to think that you would understand India or become an armchair traveler by buying this book would be a mistake, since most pictures are from 1948, 1966 and 1950 (There are a few from 1947, 1980 and 1986). India has undergone significant changes in the past 15 years. A more appropriate book for armchair travelers would be &quot;Spectacular India&quot;.	2002-10-28

Many non-Hindus have been more than happy to embrace some or all of these concepts, one of the most ubiquitous being the concept of \\"karma\\". But even they can feel awed, confused, surprised or a combination of these emotions when they first encounter the seemingly anachronistic practices of Hinduism- like worshipping the stones or trees.<br />This is one of the few books that explain well to the western audience the whats and whys of the oldest religion in the world. It focuses on the approach of common Hindu folks to their religion and how it enhances their day-to-day life. Author starts with some basic concepts and then goes on to draw pen-pictures of daily lives of devout Hindus that, at least in the religious sense, defy modernization in contemporary India. The text aided by vivid pictures fires the imagination and magically transports the reader to India. The deep passion of the author is clearly reflected in the knowledgeable text. Hinduism is a very flexible religion, which is primarily the reason it has survived thousands of years. It is perfectly acceptable to practice faith in ways different from those of ancestors, provided certain basic tenets are kept in mind. The approach to religion may vary by region, by economic status, or caste but the important thing to note that diversity is acceptable.<br />Author has presented the approach to Hinduism in rural India or that practiced by lower income strata of the society, which comprises of a significant number of Indian Hindus. This approach is different from that practiced by urban Hindus or those in middle or upper income class. This book is highly recommended to all who have interest in religion, those who have an unquenchable thirst for anything Indian and even practicing Hindus.	2002-10-24

That is indeed true. Indian style is rich in color, which is liberally used by everywhere- from palaces of erstwhile maharajas to homes in rural and urban parts of contemporary India. What fascinates most westerners is the ability of Indian interior decorations to assimilate mind-boggling number of styles from different cultures and even different eras. The whole design flows with ease- different elements blending together to enhance the look rather than impart incongruity.<br />This book presents exactly these aspects and is meant to inspire the reader. As each part of the home is visited, different styles are explored, explained and in some cases, re-interpreted for contemporary living. Some of these are high-end and would not be practically possible to duplicate. But most can easily be adapted in the Western settings to infuse them with an ethnic flair or just make them outright Indian. The beautiful color pictures are sure to fire your imagination. The types of accessories shown are commonplace in India and at most Indian art stores in other countries. You may not find the exact duplicates but you are bound to find something close. Recipedelights.com recommends this book and feels that it will start off the reader in the right direction. Everything else is limited only by the reader's imagination.	2002-10-15

There is also a belief that a natural flow of energy exists which should not be blocked and that all elements- living or non-living- should be aligned in a way to facilitate this flow of energy.<br />Vaastu shastra is an old Indian text that contains the principles of building construction and placements of objects within it, in accordance with the principles above. But in view of the religious nature of the Indian people, this text explains these principles more in terms of Gods rather than energy. It uses eight directions instead of just the cardinal four. This ancient text contains instructions on things like the shape of the plot, timing of construction, placement of various rooms around the house, home decoration and even the direction in which the inhabitants sleep.<br />&quot;Vastu in 10 simple lessons&quot; has been written as a starter book. Ancient Indian text allows some flexibility and suggests some alternatives, but only to a certain degree. The author, on the other hand, allows wide latitude- maybe rightly so. After all, the rules of vaastu are not binding but are suggestions. The more principles the readers incorporate, the better- vaastu shastra claims- will be their life. The author explains various principles in context of their traditional significance and relevance to modern day life. Some people confuse Vaastu shastra with feng shui. In spite of the goal being the same, the principles in these two tomes are entirely different and may be at conflict with one another. The practitioners can practice one or the other but not both. This books would be a decent starting point for anyone interested in the science of vaastu.	2002-10-15

A myriad of colors can be seen in the clothes people wear, product packaging, architecture, designs on vehicles and many other places. This book purports to have captured the essence of Indian advertising but ends up shocking the reader, even those who have lived in that country all their lives. It is true that the advertising there comprises of large billboards, generous use of colors and use of every available inch of space. It is indeed more colorful than anyone in west would have ever seen or imagined. That being said, it should also be pointed out that the garish advertisements pictured in the book are seen more in the southern part of India and are not representative of the entire country. The author seems to have concentrated his picks on certain regions, selected the gaudiest images he could find and ignored the tasteful advertisements that now dot the Indian landscape. Every country has its pros and cons. Selectivity of the author tends to strengthen the stereotypical image of India as a rural third-world country. To be fair to the author, his book does highlight the individuality and skills of the artists but even that would not encourage recommendation of this book. Whether you are an Indian or someone looking to visit India, money spent on this ugly book would be well spent somewhere else. Artists and art students may want to thumb through the book.

This book has an almost clinical feel to it- very cut and dry. Emphasis has been placed on names, places and dates rather than the bigger picture, which might be expected of such a small book attempting to cover more than 5000 years of Indian history. Sometime rambling sometimes lucid text is densely written and drops subtle hints of British superiority.<br />I started reading the book and had not looked at the biography of the author. Almost 1/3rd of the way through the book, a clear pattern emerged wherein the author tried to project that much of what the world knows of India's glory is a result of British efforts. And how the British brought civility and culture to India. It also seemed that the image that the author projected of India was along the lines of what a British \\"sahib\\" may have thought of the locals. It was then that I read the author's biography and saw that he was Director of Counter-Propaganda to the Government of India. From the period when he served the government it is obvious that the author was not employed by Government of Independent India but the British Government ruling India (which technically speaking was also the Government of India).<br />I really feel that justice was not done to the subject matter. Maybe someone who is both- a patriotic Indian and a history buff- might enjoy some aspects of this book. An average reader would find the treatment of this subject poor (and boring) at worst and mediocre at best. I would not recommend this book.	2002-09-28

With the advent of camera, there was a deep interest in capturing the romance, glory and mysticism of the India. Western artists, photographers and adventurers made an attempt to understand and record the mysterious and exotic India. Many books were published during this time, which were a huge hit with public.

We at Recipedelights.com consider this an outstanding book that is a \\"must-buy\\" for Collectors.	2002-09-17

But what are palaces and its architecture without some interesting history. The description and historical background accompanying the fine-detail-high-gloss mostly-color pictures breathes life into the palaces and stokes the imagination of the reader. This book is an authoritative survey of surviving proofs of lavishness enjoyed by erstwhile Indian royalty. Highly recommended for tourists with enthusiasm for architecture as well as professional architects (This review has been taken from Recipedelights.com).	2002-09-17

Most journalists and photographers have exhibited shortsightedness by never being able to see beyond India's status as a third-world country. This has reinforced India's reputation in the Western world more in terms of what it was under British rule rather than the period before or after it. Of course this is not an accurate portrayal of the rich culture, heritage and diversity spanning thousands of years; and modernity of rapidly changing contemporary India.<br />\\"Spectacular India\\" is beautiful collection of 150 color photographs by some of India's finest photographers with accompanying text by prominent Indian experts. It makes an honest and successful attempt of portraying real India and does justice to the country and it's people. It gives a sense of what India was, what India is and where it is heading. Recipedelights.com gives it a \\"must-buy\\" rating for Tourists, armchair Indians and Indians away from home. The format and size of this delectable volume make it a perfect coffee-table book.	2002-09-17
