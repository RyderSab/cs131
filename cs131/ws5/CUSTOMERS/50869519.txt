(Time Out Guides)	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Only guide that does DC art galleries	The current Timeout 2004 guide for Washington, DC has really good coverage of DC art galleries; in fact it is the only DC guide that offers any decent \\"guiding\\" to Washington area galleries.  <br /> <br />It is written by Jessica Dawson, who also pens the \\"Galleries\\" column for the Washington Post.  <br /> <br />She has a good introduction and even lists her favorites for 2004 under \\"Names of the Game.\\"  <br /> <br />Jessica nails it when she recognizes in her intro that a new \\"optimism\\" is kindling a really good art scene in the Washington, DC region.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, throughout the pages dedicated to the galleries, and as it is to be expected, there are quite a few comparisons to New York this, New York that all over the place.  <br /> <br />And reading through Jessica's descriptions of the various galleries also offers an honest and rare insight as to how this critic evaluates and views (she seems to have something about \\"safe art,\\" whatever that is) most of the Greater Washington, DC region's art galleries. For example Dawson praises Zenith Gallery's Margery Goldberg for her \\"tireless activism,\\" but describes the gallery as \\"while influential in the neon art scene, consistently shows mediocre painting and craft.\\"  <br /> <br />Addison/Ripley is praised for selling \\"high-calibre paintings, photography and prints,\\" but \\"their selections, while lovely, are awfully safe.\\"  <br /> <br />Cheryl Numark is \\"Washington's power dealer\\", while Leigh Conner shows work by the \\"kind of cutting-edge artists that Washingtonians usually travel to New York to see.\\"  <br /> <br />MOCA is \\"DC's answer to the hip, alternative galleries of New York.\\"  <br /> <br />Fraser Gallery (which I co-own) \\"concentrates on photography, but occasionally shows innovative sculpture and work in other media,\\" while our Bethesda outpost is a \\"bright, glass-walled gallery [that] exhibits realist painting and photography.\\"  <br /> <br />Hemphill Fine Arts \\"plays host to many of Washington'sstrongest artists,\\" but \\"the art here tends towards the decorative.\\"  <br /> <br />Fusebox is \\"sharp and savvy,\\" and has \\"raised the bar for visual art in Washington,\\" and their openings are \\"events to see and be seen at.\\"  <br /> <br />Anyway...

Too much is also made of Desi Arnaz's negative portrayal of Cuban men, although I never knew until I read this book that Eamon de Valera was half Cuban and that the Capote in Truman was Cuban. <br /> <br />But it does hit the nail right on the head on the formula via which the Cuban culture and character - so different from other Latin American countries - was formed.  <br /> <br />The powerful influence of the USA and all things American upon the island may have been somewhat blown out of proportion (especially when not brought to a lower class context), but it was (and is) nonetheless important and a key ingridient in the make-up of the modern Cuban. <br /> <br />I suspect that when Cuba opens up to the world, those Cubans who remained in the prison island will soon re-join the interrupted life of a island full of paradoxes, brilliant thinkers and an unfortunate history of dictators and bloodshed. And perhaps the marriage between Castro's Afro-Cuba and the exile's mostly white-Cuba will result not in a baptism of fire (or blood) but in an incorporation of lessons learned in 50 years of modern exile with the astounding eneregy and creativity of the Cuban people.	2004-12-18

It is a must read for students of Cuban history from the viewpoint of an insider.	2004-12-18

At the risk of sounding pedantic... <br /> <br />I find it incredible that the voice over for the movie trailers for the new Che Guevara movie The Motorcycle Diaries mispronounces Guevara's last name! <br /> <br />The \\"u\\" in Guevara is silent - It is not GUeh-varah; it is GE-varah (soft \\"G\\"). <br /> <br />And I haven't seen the movie yet, but I bet that Hollywood glosses over one of the key aspects of Che's motorcycle trek: His (then) racist attitude towards Indians and Blacks. <br /> <br />In 1952, together with his friend Alberto Granado, Che took a wandering trip through South America, begging, drinking and borrowing their way through Argentina's northern neighbors. The book \\"Motorcycle Diaries\\" is about this trek, and the movie is based on this book. <br /> <br />And it is a strong book by a very young man, revealing some isnight into a man who was to become perhaps the 20th century's most famous face. <br /> <br />Peru, with its largely pure Indian population had a profound effect on Guevara, and he refers to the Andean Indians as the \\"beaten race\\" in his diary. Since Argentina's own Indians had long been destroyed and overwhelmed by the millions of white immigrants from Spain, Germany and Italy which populated his homeland, it was in Peru where Che first met an oppressed people, and he notes in his writing that although he and Granado were usually broke, they were able to get by on \\"favors and concessions\\" based on their white skin.  <br /> <br />South America's Caribbean coast provided him with his first exposure to black people, and oddly enough, the man who was later to fight alongside Africans in the Congo made some harsh observations, deeply fragmented with stereotypical Argentinean white racism:  <br /> <br />\\"The blacks, those magnificent examples of the African race who have conserved their racial purity by a lack of affinity with washing, have seen their patch invaded by a different kind of slave: The Portugese.... the black is indolent and fanciful,he spends his money on frivolity and drink; the European comes from a tradition of working and saving which follows him to this corner of America and drives him to get ahead.\\"  <br /> <br />In his defense, as Che grew, his native racism towards people of color was discarded, and eventually he even married a mestiza. <br /> <br />But I suspect that the movie misses this area of this fascinating and iconic man's life. <br /> <br />I'll let you know when I see it.	2004-09-30

It is as if the author had taken her thesis and expanded it into a book, which is exactly what she did.<br />The book does seem to affirm the importance of the true martyrs of the Cuban Revolution, those fighting Batista in the cities - the &quot;llano&quot; revolutionaries, which have been somewhat pushed aside in Cuban mythology by the exaggerated myth of the Sierra fighters developed by Che Guevara after the Revolution.<br />While the book does affirm and establishes the immense contributions of all the other groups and people fighting the Batista dictatorship, it seems to me that it fails to answer the same question that it raises: WHY did Castro and his band diminish their contributions?, why did they splinter their unions? It was of course the threat of potential &quot;other than Castro and his group&quot; heroes sharing in the victory and challenging Castro's caudillismo and eventual brutal dictatorship.<br />And I wondered what would have happened had Frank Pais not been murdered by Batistianos?<br />And the answer, of course, is that he would have suffered the same fate later on in Castro's hands as countless other Cuban martyrs, who were not Communist, did.<br />The book is well researched, and Sweig has obviously had a lot of access to the Cuban regime's doctored archives. It is because of this access that perhaps she is somewhat soft on her evaluation of Castro and his motives. Nonetheless, regardless of this bias and some apparent historical errors here and there, it remains an interesting, if somewhat hard to read, window on a part of the Cuban Revolution that has been diminished by the regime.	2004-03-27

Let me explain. In 1977 I started art school as a not so impressionable 21 year-old with a few years as a US Navy sailor under my belt. But in the world of art, there's a lot of moulding and impressions being made by a very galvanized world. And although I was a few years older than most in my class... I was probably as ready as any to swallow the whole line and sinker that the \\"modern art world\\" floats out there.<br />Then I read this book - it was given to me by Jacob Lawrence, a great painter and a great teacher --- although I didn't get along with him too well at the time. I read it (almost by accident and against my will --- it was a get-a-way \\"love weekend\\" with my then-girlfriend - it went sour. And this book OPENED my EYES!!! It was as if all of a sudden a \\"fog\\" had been listed about all the manure and fog that covers the whole art world.<br />I used it as a weapon.<br />I used it to defend how I wanted to paint and feel and write. And it allowed me to survive art school.<br />And then in 1991 - as I prepared to look around to start my own gallery - I found it again, in a gallery (of all places) in Alexandria, VA. I read it again, and to my surprise Wolfe was as topical and effervescent and eye-opening as ever!<br />Wolfe has a lot of bones to pick with the art world -- 25 years ago!!! He destroys the proliferation of art theory, and puts \\"art gods\\" like Harold Rosenberg, Clement Greenberg, and Leo Steinberg (who have ruined art criticism for all ages - by making critics think that they \\"lead\\" the arts rather than \\"follow the artists\\") into their proper place and perspective. He has a lot of fun, especially with Greenberg and the Washington Color School and their common stupidity about the flatness of the picture plane.<br />Here's my recommendation: If you are a young art student or a practicing artist: SAVE YOUR LIFE! Read this book!	2003-05-03

Lam was born in Cuba, and as the son of a black ex-slave and a Chinese immigrant, he probably would have never been recorded in history had it not been for the vision of his grandmother, who saved enough money (recognizing his artistic talent) to send the young Lam to study art in Spain. Because of racism, he ends up in Paris, where he hangs around Picasso and the other luminaries of the times. It is easy to see how Picasso \\"discovered\\" African themes in Lam's works and copying the Cuban master's ideas, delivered a new period to his own works. Lam escapes the Nazis and returns to Cuba, and after Castro becomes an icon in world art - somewhat tainted in the eyes of many Cubans -- by his close relationship with the government of the Communist dictator. There has been much controversy about Lam's works after his death, as many \\"fakes\\" have surfaced, and some have even accused the Cuban government of producing (and certifying) them.	2003-05-01

From the very beginning Gonzalez Echavarria had me smelling the air in a Cuban baseball satdium and feeling the tension in the crowd as the pitchers winds up.<br />But what this book truly delivers, is a history lesson to those who think they know Cuban baseball, which has often been &quot;presented&quot; through American eyes (such as PBS specials or even through Ken Burns' documentary on Baseball).<br />Cubans not only exported baseball through Latin America, but because of the paradox of the intense Cuban racism at the amateur level and integrated leagues at the professional level, many young black Cuban players found fame and fortune in Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico and other places (including the Negro Leagues in the US), while many US professional Negro Leagues got to play alogside white US teammates in professional Cuban teams. Even the virulent Ty Cobb!<br />It also tells the stories of Cuban legends - such as Adolfo Luque - who played in the US Major Leagues in the 20's through the 60's - both as pitcher and manager in a time when white Cubans were allowed to play US professional baseball while their talented black countrymen couldn't.<br />This is a must read - from a Cuban perspective - for fans of baseball - not just Cuban baseball!	2003-05-01

It seems, according to some influential art scribes writing in the trail of this traveling exhibition, that the much heralded demise of painting, much like Mark Twains death, has been greatly exaggerated. Showcasing about 120 works over a 40-year period, this book is one of the most comprehensive retrospectives ever mounted about a contemporary painter in recent memory, and that by itself is a strong enough reason to buy it. However, it is what has been proven by Richters career and accomplishments, and unexpected stature in the art world (Sothebys recently dubbed him the most influential living artist in the world) and now driven home here, that makes this a-once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn some lessons about the contemporary art world. You see, Richter doesnt fit the formula for success that many art curators and influential critics and other art powers-that-be have carefully crafted in the rarified atmospheres of the upper crusts of the art world. In fact, Richter breaks every rule that often starts being pressed upon 18-year old art students and then is hammered home in reviews and lectures by many contemporary art critics and curators. Rules like you better have your own recognizable style! or only new is good and the oddest rule of all: painting is dead! But Richter is not only a painter in an era forced to focus on video artists, performance stars and PhotoShop wonders, but also Richter wanders from style to style with an ease and speed that makes this book a lesson on half a dozen art movements of the last century beautifully continued onto the current one. Thumb through the pages here and youll soon discover that Richter is as much as ease with photorealism  some ultra sharp and some foggy in detail -- as he is with pure abstraction and with romantic paintings of pretty clouds and scenic waterfalls. This is an artist who is not just happy with thumbing his nose at the well-enforced rule that a good artist has to have a clearly identifiable style and do something new, but who also seems intent on destroying the other forced formulas of the modern art world: he copies other artists works, works directly from photographs, blah, blah, blah  all sins that would make all my art professors and most art critics sigh in disgust. But above all, Richter paints, and he paints in a time when painting has been dismissed as ailing and ancient. New is good, technology is good painting is dead. Why does Richter paint? Doesnt he get it? NOPE!! Its because it is all about painting! And managing to make fools of critics who forget that their job is to follow the artist  not to lead the arts. What those who consider painting an ailing form will never understand (mostly because they are not painters), is that Richter cant and wont stop painting, because through his veins runs the same intoxicating venom that fueled their ancestral kin in the caves of Altamira and which will continue to drive painters long after todays critics and curators are forgotten dust. This book shouts: Art does not have to be new to be good, and technology is not the only venue to deliver great new contemporary art - it also continues to prove that painting will never die.	2003-05-01

For example - Cubans refer to themselves as white or black or mulatto, etc. not as &quot;Hispanics&quot; and Truman consistently misuses this term as a racial delimiter (a very common American mistake) rather than a cultural amplifier. The book failed to make me believe that the story was actually set in Havana.	2003-01-09

In his ealy photorealistic -paintings Richter copied ordinary, found images onto canvas, but gave them an indistinct appearance. Again, by working directly from photographs, he manages to debunk all the criticism that such techniques often bring. This subversive realism is now more evident than ever, in these later, almost fuzzy works that still manage to knock the visual senses as if shouting: &quot;Long Live Painting - Long Live Realism!&quot;	2003-01-09

Cruz scrambles the story several times and builds and changes hard-to-follow conspiracies that ends up with Cubans changing their stories, allegiances and support - all to confuse and throw Renko off his scent. There's also some sex between Renko and the black Cuban detective, which doesn't make sense, because she really dislikes Russians. The best find in this book is the interesting tapestry of Cuban life that Cruz describes, with Santeria, racism, forced ingenuity, brutality and a colorful city destined to continue to be one of the jewels of the New World.	2002-11-12

Often one of the most overlooked aspects or genres of photography is the ability of a photographer to grab a certain nanosecond of time and leave behind an impression of a people or a culture that anchors that people in time forever. It looks easy because there are so many talented photographers who have left behind haunting images in magazines such as National Geographic, Look, Life, etc. Add Wayne Schoenfeld to the mix.... In this book this California photographer brings us two incredibly different cultures as Turkey and Cuba, somehow unified by his gifted camera in this book are the serene, hard eyes of Turkish men and also the naked playfulness of blonde peasant Cuban children in Pinar del Rio province - these are disparate subjects that in a rather unusual manner come together beautifully as do many others, in this excellent book.	2002-06-01

Some of the moments in the book are intimate, while others are possibly exagerations of the artists' famous life.<br />With a movie in the works (Selma Hayek plays Frida - that is after Laura San Giacomo, Madonna and Jennifer Lopez all had the part, and were dropped because Fridomexicans complained about the lack of Mexicanity in the actresses chosen to portrait their newly-found goddess), Kahlo is sure to solidify her position as the top-of-the-art-food-chain Latin American artist of the century (Georgia O'Keefe considered her the best female artist of the 20th century) and make her iconic face even more famous.<br />Kahlo deserves this position because she painted honestly and brutally. She painted her memorable Jewish-Austrian-Spanish-Mexican face, single eyebrow and slim moustache in stark honesty; she had many lovers of both sexes (when such a course of sex exploits was practically unknown); she grabbed her Mexicanity with a fierce pride and ferocity that would not be in vogue until decades after her death (Kahlo was born in 1907 and died in 1954) and yet during her life she was just the wife of a very famous Mexican muralist and a champagne Communist who partied with the Fords and Rockefellers while marching with the workers down the wide avenues of Mexico City. It is thus ironic that it is Kahlo, whose astonishing life and unique paintings are now the subject of lawsuits between governments and collectors, has taken the limelight from her talented womanizer husband and is rightfully considered one of the best artists of the 20th century, period. This is THE BOOK about her.	2002-05-25

The author allows us to see Cuba through a foreigner's eyes, and while her lack of \\"Cubanosity\\" creates some odd reading at times, her Puritan observations do deliver some insight into this poor island with its long history of repression, bloody dictatorships and a wonderful people with worldly charms and vices. We discover Cuban pride, elegance, racism, poverty and even a bit about Fidel Castro. We read about what unites some Cubans and about the subtle racism of Cuban society, still run mostly by white Cubans in theoretically an equal society of this Communist dinosaur. The book succeeds in letting us observe Cuba through the eyes of a non-Cuban, and even in its failures, allows us to recognize what are hopefully the last gasps of a repressive society hopefully in its death gasps.	2002-05-25

Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure (The 25th Anniversary Edition)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Top Ten of All Time	This book is one of the top ten books (my list) of all time. I first read it as a child, then in college and many times since then, and now my son will soon fall under its enchantment. Forget the movie, which wasn't too bad, and get a copy of this truly astounding piece of literature and you'll cry tears of anger, of joy and of terror. Everything is here, from the world's most beautiful woman, to the greatest swordsman in the world, to terrible and evil bad guys, funny ones, dead heros and many more pages full of great words that no movie can aptly describe.	2002-05-25

It is full of data and facts and dates and does provide some very interesting facts to uncloud this rather mystical period of Anglo-Scottish history. Some chapters, such as the one detailing the truces and costs paid by English towns and villages to avoid Scottish attacks, are a bit thick to read, but others, such as an academic view of Bannockburn and other battles, do open the eyes to the Scottish struggle that kept the English away from dominating its neighbor to the north.	2002-05-25

She painted her memorable Jewish-Austrian-Spanish-Mexican face, single eyebrow and slim moustache in stark honesty; she had many lovers of both sexes (when such a course of sex exploits was practically unknown); she grabbed her Mexicanity with a fierce pride and ferocity that would not be in vogue until decades after her death (Kahlo was born in 1907 and died in 1954) and yet during her life she was just the wife of a very famous Mexican muralist and a champagne Communist who partied with the Fords and Rockefellers while marching with the workers down the wide avenues of Mexico City. It is thus ironic that it is Kahlo, whose astonishing life and unique paintings are now the subject of lawsuits between governments and collectors, has taken the limelight from her talented womanizer husband and is rightfully considered one of the best artists of the 20th century, period. This is a nice addition and a must read for Kahlophiles.	2002-05-25

A Social Anthropological Resolution of the Problem of the Picts	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Questions Answered - Questions asked	It has been said (by me) &quot;Without a doubt the best book on Pictish studies since Wainwright's &quot;The Problem of the Picts&quot; and just like that book, a great controversial entry to the field!&quot;<br />What Jackson does rather well is to deliver a brilliant and complicated theory on the marriage system of Pictish society, which according to him was governed by a complicated set of rules based on the number seven. He also delivers a clear new interpretration of Sueno's stone and the overall message in the carved stones of Scotland's original people. <br />Pictish studies have been characterized (due to lack of actual evidence) by a lot of guesses and educated postulations - it all depends if you are in the Celtic camp or not - were they Celts? or were they a non Celtic people? The Picts were around till the 9th century and yet we know less about them than people who have disappeared for thousands of years. more research is needed.	2002-05-25

After thousands of photographs we see this basic American Southern family grow and develop before our eyes. Sills' eyes and camera allow us to discover beauty where others may see ... trash and dirt. Tina Toole develops into a Frida Kahloesque sort of chameleon-like woman, often pretty, sometimes tough, but always mesmerizing. This is one of those books that every photographic aficionado should buy.	2002-05-25

To me she was an all-knowing, all-powerful person, and quite a beautiful woman to my adoring and fearing child eyes. Many years after her death, and with a mind now conditioned to see skeletal models representing someone's ideal of beauty, it took this brilliant book by Tenneson to rekindle the power and beauty of women aged 65 and older. Tenneson applies her formidable portraiture skills with an artistic ferocity that leaves no doubt in place to the fact that in doing this project, she discovered a lot of issues with her own self and perception of beauty and fear. This is one of those rare photography books that I sense are destined to become a keystone in contemporary photography and re-enforce Tenneson's place among the elite of the fine arts photography world. But more importantly, it represents a powerful alternative challenge to what has been forced fed to us about beauty and power, and help some of us to remember fondly a loving, powerful grandmother.	2002-04-19

This is a book that shows a romantic at heart with the courage to paint what he feels regardless of modern day art critics who have failed to realize that their written word no longer carries any weight in the world of art. Vettriano is a romantic Hopper, but better - he stylizes, preaches, decorates, creates and delivers wondrous works that remind us why we love painting and painters who ignore critics and fashion and trends and paint what they want to paint. This is a success story from the very dark depths of the public's ability to make superstars in art that give art critic stomach acid for centuries to come - when their names are forgotten, Vettriano's dismissed artwork will still be colelcted, sought-after and admired.

Within a handful of pages Meadows drowns your abilities to put the book down! There an abundance of technical and military jargon, but used to perfection to make the story sizzle and move along prodigiously. This is the kind of book to grab at the beginning of a long train ride or long flight and before you realize it, you are skipping your meal in order to continue reading it.	2001-09-29

MacKenzie takes you through a voyage to the abandoned worlds of farms, schools and other building in the middle of the nowhere lands of midwestern America. Here we find that ruined farmhouse, strangely sculpted by the winds and snow of many winters, but not depicted as some quaint, picturesque image, but as a stark vision in long Puritan panoramic views that work to make the landscapes appear as through they are suspended in time, a strange reminder of once active places, now abandoned and ruined, but notheless spectacular in their setting. This is the photographer that will make you throw away your Nan Goldins and your Cindy Shermans and discover what is it that makes photography the newest vibrant member of the visual fine arts.	2001-09-29

MacKenzie flies around his birthplace regions, and then finds these places, that once he photographs, become temples of the ravages of time. These are photos that make one sense's shudder at the visual touch of the moment when something went awry with a schoolhouse, or a barn or a house. He has frozen, via huge, elegant landscapes, a moment in time, an uncomfortable, but spectacular moment. I was stunned by these photographs and by the senseless beauty and brooding quality of them.	2001-07-12

This is what makes this such a special book, is that Karin Rosenthal delivers a brilliant tour of what can be accomplished with something as beautiful as the body and Earth elements, most notably water. This is a skilled, creative photographer with ample darkroom skills to boot!	2001-02-12
