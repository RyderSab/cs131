If you want an Italian lesson, read \\"The Broker\\".  This book didn't have a plot until three-quarters through.  If you thought \\"The Street Lawyer\\" was weak, this fare is even worse.	2005-06-27

This is the first book I've read by Koontz, so I am hopeful that all of his books aren't like this.  The first chapter introduces at least 25-30 characters, none of which I was particularly interested in.  Obviously there are many readers who like this \\"flakey\\" style of writing.  I just want to read a story.  Guess I'll stick to James Lee Burke, Stuart Woods, James Patterson, etc.  This book is to involved for me.	2005-01-28

There is very little plot in this story; mostly talking heads.  Credit Holly Barker for taking about three days to seduce Stone, though.  Usually the females in the Barrington mysteries jump into bed with Stone in under 24 hours, which is another part of this series that I have never understood.  The stories should be strong enough to not have to resort to the unbelievable sexcapades of Mr. Barrington, where women are all to eager to jump in the sack with him and are never sexually satisfied, leaving the poor sexually starved women trying to arouse Stone for yet another round.	2004-10-12

The introduction to the book says &quot;When The Wind Blows&quot; was one of the most widely read and appreciated books around the world.  I thought the book &quot;blows&quot; for sure.  The first was bad enough, but &quot;Lake House&quot; is pitiful.  I read a little more than half before I gave up.  I don't care about any of the characters in this book.  Stupid flying kids!

In past reviews, I have stated that he needs to stretch and go beyond the law dramas which made him famous.  It was the only way to prove whether he was a great writer or not!  In &quot;A Painted House&quot;, Grisham completely changes style.  This book reads like &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, which is my favorite book of all time.  With this book, Grisham proves that he is now America's greatest writer.  This book deserves many accolades and awards, and it would be a crime if it doesn't win every one.

Since she was at one time friends with Truman Capote, many have thought that he had a hand in the authoring of this great book, but that's not so.
