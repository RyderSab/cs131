The main point of this book is there exists a core group of people in any organization. Their concerns are what really drive the company. Not the market, the business, or anything else. There is a club aspect to any business, no matter how people may want to pretend its something more slick/high tech. Plenty of anecdotes. The book has some merit. However, this book should be called \\"Core Group is My Theory to Explain Everything\\". I would bet over half of all the paragraphs in the book contain the phrase \\"Core Group\\". I wonder if the author has a copywright on the term or something. Maybe hes doing \\"Core Group Learning Seminars\\", for a fee. (Be sure to go to one and tell me how it is.) To sum up :  Good anectdotes, not great book structure, massive repition of the term \\"Core Group\\". There are alot of management  books out there. Just throw this onto the pile.	2004-01-17

This is a very readable, compelling, well investigated, timely book. If you have any interest in Enron at all, you will like this book. <br />The main question I had - What the hell was going on? - was well explained in this book. I learned about 'Mark to Market' accounting, 3 billion dollar white elephant power plants, expense account $ at strip clubs (Lou Pai thats you!), 45 million dollar corporate jets, the Wall Street analysts who were didn't know what they were talking about, the pushover of Arthur Anderson, what went on during California's rolling blackouts, and Fastow &amp; Co and their off the books Cayman island shenanigans. <br />Enron thought of itself as the coolest company in the world. It was Fortune magazine's most innovative company for several years. Way to go Fortune!<br />Aside from the entertainment value of the book, I feel that I have gained a healthy skepticism. For example, when a company executive tells you they're doing fine, undervalued even, they might be selling their own stock. Big companies aren't as well led, as rigorously audited, closely analyzed, and regulated, as I would have thought in 1999. The whole of American business has been besmirched if you ask me. Enron, Worldcom, Adelphia, etc. There should be a lesson here somewhere....<br />I highly recommend this book.	2003-12-22

Also some disussion of the psychology of competition. That's good stuff, but the author keeps throwing his own persona into it, and he's kind of obnoxious, to put it politely. Its like a Saturday Night Live character giving an economics class or something. But not quite as funny. If you can get past that though, it's a decent book. I'd like to read more about the subject, but by someone else.	2003-10-20

There is alot more to say about blue-collar America than Babara wants to fit in here cute little articles. Too bad. Try Ben Cheevers book. Hes' significantly less flippant, believe it or not.

I have thumbed through a few .net and one ado.net books and this has been pretty much the most useful for me. The other ado.net book by David Sceppa was ok, but typical for Microsoft, its heavy on the wizards and stuff so I didn't learn as much as I might have. Plus, in my case, the wizards didnt always work because I was trying to hook up to FoxPro, not SqlServer. This book has a tendency to see things from Sqlservers point of view too, even though ado.net can work with alot of rdbmss. Anyway, if you are familiar with Oreillys nutshell books, Unix in a Nutshell for example, you will have an idea of what is up with this book. Its an excellent addition to Oreillys line.	2003-06-23

But, in my humble opinion, that is a neat thing. The author talks about alot of things besides a simple list of Erdos' achievements. It is a very readable book. The author talks about such as: Hungarian history, Fermat's last theorem, the history of math, etc. This is a fun read...

The chapters on file locking, command line processing, and date and time functions were excellent. The code presented was very readable and consise. I am talking about production quality code that I added to my projects at work. Well worth the money for me. The other main book on unix programming is the Oreilly book Systems Programming in Unix. Or something like that. Other people at work have that one, but, in my opinion, this book is better. If you program in a Unix environment, and have to deal with it at a systems level, this book has stuff in it you can use.	2001-02-20

For example the link editor, libraries, c command line options. In particular I like the sections on gdb and gprof. Super useful. The intro has a section on unix and setting up your environmental variables, another neglected topic. The only section that didn't interest me is the section on emacs since I am a vi guy. But, it doesn't hurt to have it either... In sum, if you are a true UNIX guru, you may already know all this stuff, but, if you are an aspiring guru, like myself, this is pure gold.	2001-02-20

Bugliosi is not just a good lawyer, he's an excellent writer. To this day, if I see an article he's written on current topics, for example O.J., George W. Bush's election, I go out of my way to read it. They always rock. Even if you don't agree with him, he makes his points clearly, and with depth. Helter Skelter is the last word on Manson. Bugliosi is a very on the ball observer. He has a good feel for the underworld Manson lived in, and the California of the time. This book hasn't dated a bit.	2001-01-24

In my opinion, Banks is an old school author like Dickens, Dostoyevsky, Twain, etc. Its' not a 'postmodern' book. But, on the other hand, it is more honest about how life is lived now. Banks' eye for detail is precise. I really had a feel for the scene, the characters were real, compelling. It's a classic.	2001-01-07

If you have romanticized notion of the mob, if you really think it's like the Godfather, you are in for a surprise. Sammy goes through the daily routine of a mob member. The problems he had as a club owner, the people he killed as a mob hit man. However, I dont' get the impression he is bragging. In any case, it makes for very interesting reading. He talks about the details of how the FBI caught up to him. Why Paul Castellano was killed etc. As for morality, hey, he helpled put Gotti behind bars, anyone who is against that is just a mob groupie. (There must be alot from the reviews...) Further, Peter Maas is the great writer of the New York crime scene. Serpico, in particular was another guy who was hated by his peers. He was a cop too. Just goes to show you, if you are relatively honest, you get in so much more trouble...	2001-01-07

True crime is one of my fav genres and there is nothing like this book. This guy never got caught. He wrote the paper the author worked for DARING  them to catch him. Giving them evidence and weird, cryptic clues. The  author investigates suspects himself. At points you wouldn't be surprised  to see him get shot at. This story has EVERYTHING a crime reader would  want. Read this book and you'll be wondering if the Zodiac is still out  there. Is he reading this now?	2000-06-17

In this book he talks about what it was like to live there. He talks about having to prove yourself or face the prospect of getting your ... kicked in the future. You get a VIVID description of what he was up against as a young person. I mean, I grew up  a long way away in a much less dangerous  place, and I knew exactly what he  was getting at. That's a testament to his writing, and the universality of  the subject. Mr. Canada recalls one episode where he is walking a few  blocks out of his neighborhood, and you get a detailed view of how  dangerous this was. Just walking down the street! All I can say against the  book is that I would have liked even more of the authors autobiography.  Later on in the book, he gets more polemical about what can be done. I  agree with what he says, but as far as literary quality goes, that stuff  isn't really in the same league as the earlier part of the book. Also, let  me say, the author has an excellent, direct writing style, which makes what  he has to say that much more powerful.	2000-06-17

He writes about things that as an adult you aren't even conscious of anymore. How reading a book about horses and armies can bring those things to life. Sartre talks about his  grandfather, his mother, his absent father. He is pretty dispassionate  about them. The main thing about the book is Sartres' keen observation and  reckless honesty. In the usual autobiography you get alot of bluster, the  secret to my success type stuff. Someone, I think it was Martin Amis, said,  all autobiographies are success stories. You see that all the time. How I  rose from my humble background to be a rich and famous such and such. Well  you don't get that here. This is Jean Paul's life before he ever did  anything noteworthy. Astonishing level of honesty. I look at memoirs  differently after this.	2000-05-29

From my perspective, his vision is significantly more acute than Dante's. It is tightly written. Fast moving. Eye opening. When I was reading the play, I  frequently had to put the book down and think for a while about what I had  just read. I had never read anything quite like it. This book deserves a  wide audience. It is more fun than you might think. Even if, like me, you  aren't into reading books like being and nothingness, you might like this.  This book is wild.	2000-05-29

In this book you get the same honesty the same dazzling writing. It's hard to pin down but the way Mr. Wolff writes you REALLY feel like you know him. There is no  pretension, no hype to his writing. No bs. Wolff has alot of anecdotes to  tell about his youth. Off the top of my head I can recall his experiences  watching Bonanza on tv. in Vietnam. It was quite a story believe me. And it  touched on things like, the savvy of his second in command, the day to day  life of a soldier... This book is filled with telling stories like this.  You won't see this sort of thing in your usual Vietnam memoir. Least I  wouldn't think so. I will say one thing though. Before I read any of  Wolff's work it seemed, from the reviews and the book jacket that I was in  for a kind of dull book that had a way of obliging the reader to  acknowledge it. Nothing could be further from the truth. This book has it all - chills, thrills, laughs. What a good read.	2000-05-29

Not really a digital diary, but a collection of self consciously off the wall comments and photos. Pretty much like you would see in any  'hip' contemporary magazine. And about as artificial. Totally lacking  context. There is no substantive autobiographical sketch, no pictures of  Natachas's neighborhood. Could have had something here. I wouldn't mind  reading the authors memoir if she could be bothered to write something  meaningful. On the plus side, she is pretty cute and you do get to see her  naked.	2000-05-28

In the book he discusses what we in the west might learn from the east. The east has lower crime rates, lower unemployment, safe, clean public places. He traces the roots of the  Asian miracle to the emphasis and tradition of the Confucian ethic. That is  the  basic thesis of the book, but a large part of the pleasure of the book  comes from Mr Reid's direct, down home writing style. He has many hilarious  anecdotes. Mistranslated English, exotic asian pizzas... He writes about a  steel company that made a giant indoor ski area and how that grew from an  effort to keep people employed. His neighbor, an elderly gentleman intructs  him an Japanese customs... Never dogmatic, always entertaining. The basic  message is there are things we can learn from asia, so he lets us see some  of the good stuff going on there. Certainly a good message.	2000-05-28

If you liked Studs Terkel's working you will like this book. The folks form word.com talk to people from every possible occupation, such as coporate lawyer, stripper, taco bell worker, CEO, etc. Each of them gets a  couple of pages at least, and they talk freely about what their work  experience is like. Some people love their jobs, some people plan on  quitting soon. It is like talking to these people yourself. Gig is a fun  read. There are lots of nicely obsereved details. The UPS guy talks about  having to wear certain color t-shirts. An artist talks about liking the  smell of paint. A temp guy talks about the need to look busy.  It has a  very high hard-to-put-down quotient. Also, I think it is a important book.   This is the way people really think about their livlihood. A nice antitdote  to coporate bs.

The author is essentially telling us his life story, but he is always digressing onto some by the way topic. Same technique used in Jacques the Fatalist and Tristam Shandy. It's  a good style too. For the most part Eggers kept me interested. Moved the  story along quickly. Moving in parts. But the last third of the book is  repetitious, monotonous, boring, and hokey. He admitted as much though in  the intro though. And his shenanigans involving Adam Rich were sick and  embarassing. Parts like that really were exhibitionistic. It definately  could have been better, though the good parts were different enough to make  it worth a read possibly.	2000-05-28

The author is talking about a single test which has a huge impact on millions of people. The implications of the SAT are huge, but the reasoning behind it is something that is rarely mentioned explicitly. The author explains it all... It isn't that Lemann is  simply against the SAT. This book isn't that polemical. We get the  background of the test. The story of American education. I learned alot  from that. I did not know that Yale limited the number of minorities and  women up until the 60s. And that the children of alumni really were  favored. You tend to think that things were always the way they are now ...  And I also believed the testing service when they said that you can't cram  for the SAT. Wrong.. And the discussion of affirmative action is right on  target too. In a lot of ways people aren't given equal opportunities, and  then when they are left behind the meritocracy says it is their  fault...This book is very readable and thought provoking. The only thing I  can say against it is like a previous poster, it is a little slow to start  off with. But  it picks up quickly enough, I thought.	2000-05-09
