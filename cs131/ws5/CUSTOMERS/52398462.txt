Pennington of Kickapoo County is having a \\"special\\" sexual affair with this railroad engineer's wife, Lisa. And when he drives over and tells her her husband has been murdered, what does she do? Why orders Pennington to strip her and watch while she masturbates, screaming her bloody head off, of course.  Seems all the reviewers here think that is sexy. I think it's sicko. Why does Pennington just watch? Cuz of some war injury, he can no longer get it up. What watching sex is gonna do for him I don't have the slightest idea. The same thing happens the day of the funeral out there in the cemetery, again screaming her head off. Get real.<br />Next a woman detective from Scotland Yard arrives. And she is incessantly flirty and unprofessional. She doesn't know Pennington from adam yet she hones in on his \\"special\\" sexual relationship with Lisa like a tease. Like she'd like to take Lisa place. <br />Shallow story with shallow characters. Not recommended.	2004-05-30

Mr. King forgets to \\"Show, don't tell\\"  Mr. King should reread and follow his own book \\"On Writing\\"  After I got to page 100 I started skipping paragraphs then eventually whole pages. Tons of painfully repetitious padding. When a paragraph would suffice SK drags it to 2-4 pages!<br />As an example take a  look at Tolkien's The Hobbit (289 pages) and his The Lord of the Ring trilogy (432 pages, 352 pages and 464 pages).  Another,. more relevant example The Gunslinger (256 pages), The Drawing of the Three (406 pages), The Waste Lands (448 pages). The first three books of the Dark Tower series are great, to the point and have pace. Wizard and Glass (672 pages) and Wolves of the Calla ( 736 pages) are stagnant and bloated.<br />(...)<br />The character of Susannah still talks like a black street [prostitute], degrading and diminishing her as a serious player. Eddie too is shallow and cheap. Even Roland the Gunslinger himself is made ridiculous by his insistence on ritual and pomp regarding the simplest of things. But oh! do they keep fretting about making this and that in time and even saying \\"time is short let's get <BR>going!\\"  BUT they don't. They  take FOREVER to do anything. The speech patterns and manners of the people of Calla Byrn Srurgis were mind numbing (they take forever to spit out a simple sentence) and redundant.  The Gunslingers adopting the Calla's speech patterns and mannerisms was unnatural and even more benumbing.  But hey, it sure racks up the page count, right Mr. King?<br />Mr. King is now at full count (to use his baseball lingo). One more strike and the series is OUT and over. We, the once prized, Constant Reader lose. Mr. King wins $$ either way so it doesn't matter to him.....which is glaringly obviouse by his lack of quality these past 10+ years.<br />I hope he takes the time with the last book in the DT series. Even if it takes many years. Think compact, distilled, consise.	2004-05-16

Didn't he have any say so as to whether Winston would be charged or not? Couldn't he have refused to press charges?  Or am I wrong?  <br />Why didn't he do anything to help his good friend Winston? I mean Antonelli hired Winston cuz he thought he was the best young lawyer going and as the years go by comes to really like this kid. Yet stands by and does nothing when Winston needs him. He doesn't even visit him in the asylum for 12 yrs. Doesn't make any sense to me. What kind of a friend is that? Doesn't make the character of Antonelli very appealing.<br />I've read a couple of Buffas's Joseph Antonelli books and have yet to really feel/know any of the characters.

They mostly chose not to do or learn a dang thing. They couldn't feed themselves if they had to! They were pathetic.  They had no friends nor cared to have any. They were never sent to any school and what tutors they had,  they abused so as to get rid of them. Iris in particular had absolutely no aspirations, inclinations, or curiosity whatsoever. At least Laura got out to church and did charity work etc.  So they stayed at home virtually all their lives, doing nothing until Iris at age 19 was married off to the much older flamboyant wealthy industrialist Richard Griffin, which is totally unbelievable cuz what man, especially one like Richard, is going to want an ignorant, inexperienced, braindead girl like Iris?   There wasn't a spark of life in her....not even a ember. Dull, duller, dullest. She rarely spoke.  Which brings you to the <BR>next preposterous notion that this very same Iris has written this memoir. I bet Iris, by her own admission, could barely write her own name let alone spell or construct a sentence. The whole story is out to lunch.

Fairstein's 25 years as head of the New York district attorney's Sex Crime Unit, I expected a more intelligent,  facetious, gritty, in-depth, realistic story. Deadhouse is shallow and uninteresting. Flat. Bad writing.<br />Here again we find that everybody who is anybody to the main character is the bestest of the best in his/her field of work and personal life. Her parents are wealthy...carribean home... Marth's Vineyard...Alex doesn't go to a grocery store, she has her groceries delivered.  The dialogue between her and her detective friend, Mike are dull, dim (he calls her Blondie, euck). Mike himself is outragiously unnecessarily rude and crude to people. <br />Also here we got the main character, the head of the sex crime unit,  walking the streets of NY alone in the dead of night WITHOUT ANY means of self defense such as mace or pepper spray, stun gun, pistol, retractable steel baton, cell phone. Instead of taking a self-defense class she takes ballet.  Garbage.	2003-04-24

What a go-nowhere do-nothing story of a writer/poet who goes Calcutta, India for Harper's to get a copy of a manuscript and<br />interview a famous Indian poet, M. Das,  who supposedly died 8 years earlier but who is now purported to be alive and<br />writing again. Three quarters of the time spent in the book is playing cat and mouse obtaining the manuscript and then with<br />setting up the interview with M. Das.<br />Well it turns out old M. Das had leprosy and committed suicide. BUT he was brought back to life by Kali the Hindu goddess<br />of power, death, destruction, construction, darkness,  you name it, and used by her to write and spread the word of Kali world<br />wide (the manuscript must get published!). Anyway our poet after his interview with M. Das returns to M. Das to drop off a<br />couple of requested books. In the bag along with the books is a gun so M. Das can end his miserable life, which he does BUT<br />he doesn't have the good grace to do so later after our poet is safely away. SO the Kali disciples kidnap and kill our poets 7<br />month old daughter, whom I can't for the life of me figure why he has brought to the dirty filthy sickness infested dangerous<br />India to begin with. He chose to bring is Indian wife as an interpreter (irresponsible) and then never used her.  The death of his<br />child enrages him so that he sorta comes under the song of Kali seeking revenge. But he triumphs and goes home. End of a<br />boring pointless story. No horror here (chapter 3 yes, the rest no)<br />The only book I've enjoyed of DSs was Children of the Night.

Why oh why would he bring a gun? Did he intend to shoot it out with NASA if caught? And guess what happens with the gun. It goes off accidentally killing their pilot. So now there are only two hijackers (jack & virgil), left to accomplish this highly complicated and dangerous \\"mission\\" which ideally requires three experienced people.  Oh but wait, Penny High Eagle the stupid obnoxious and totally unqualified inexperienced payload specialist (how she even rated that is beyond me. must of been affirmative action) unwittingly slips by Jack/Virgil and boards the shuttle (the rest of crew was waylaid in an elavator. NASA security anyone again? ). And what does she want to do to these \\"shuttle hijackers\\", the only people who know anything about the blood thing and can pilot it (without a pilot?)?

Given the two wealthy girls prior generous and forward behavior with money and people they would have just gone and paid Nat's (and his mothers!) bills whether he/she liked it or not.  So for me the story ended on page 221 with this way-out of character  kidnapping scheme.<br />I did read the rest regardless tho because I sometimes like the way Mr. Abrahams weaves his stories and characters.<br />But right away comes another glaring out of characterization. Nat, who has fallen in love with Izzie and can tell her apart from her twin sister -easily- suddenly fails in recognizing Grace when the girls switch places at the last minute (Izzie becoming the kidnapped instead of Grace). <br />I think Mr. Abrahams would of done this story a favor if he'd of toned down Freedy (the bad guy) with his Andro/speed/bodybuilding obsession and gone into and expanded on the Freedy and Professor Uzig connection. Professor Uzig being Freedy's  \\"Father: Unknown\\".<br />Also, why would Nat be prosecuted for attempted extortion? The kidnapping wasn't his idea! He came down against it but the twins had acted before he saw them again.  Why didn't Izzie  come to his defense?<br />All 'n all this reads like an unfinished draft.

He was a killer. If there was anyone who deserved the gas chamber it was he.  And as far as <BR>insane or not,  to me it makes no difference. You take a life...you pay with your own.   What's the good in keeping an insane person alive anyway? Especially one who kills. I don't understand it...an insane person has no life. They are the LIVINGDEAD. I think it's cruel to keep them alive in those hospitals where you know damn well they are treated like sh!t. <br />And what kind of women and/or man has baby after baby after baby when they know they can not support them (they can't <BR>even support themselves for chirst sake!)..., when they don't really want them nor care about them. That is SICK. That's abuse. It's a sin. Joe Esquibell's mother out to be shot. She  and her sheepherder husband (alcoholic) are responsible for this whole bloody mess.

This book showed me a whole different side to our president.  I was very shocked to hear some of the stories of his college days and some of his outrageous acts even after he graduated.  His entrance into politics was not always an assured one, as he seemed to have more interests in enjoying his youth.  The author seems to gloss over some things that have a potential to be more damaging to his image than they already are.  The story of how he crashed his car into the garage after his wife criticized one of his speeches was one such example.  I had also expected him to be more successful at business than he is said to be.  Surprisingly, the Bush family has had their share of persecution while living in Texas.  In Texas they were not seen as true \\"Texans\\" and in the schools George W. attended his views were opposite of a majority of the student population.  Given his private school training and Ivy League preparation, it really makes the office of president seem only attainable by those with money.  I was disappointed that there wasn't more information on his accomplishments as a Texas governor but I was pleasantly surprised to find his State of the Union address in entirety at the back of the book.  The litigation details of the 2000 election were helpful in understanding why the selection for our new president had taken so long.  Overall, I would recommend this book to any young reader looking for a biography to read, however, I would warn them that they may have a less respectful opinion of our president after their reading.	2002-08-30

Caring?<br />What I find repulsive is that most of the people A. Rule writes about are in/from the upper socio-economic classes. These women have money! to work with, friends and family to help, outside connections etc.  Yet they do nothing.

This is HIS personal experiences and HIS thoughts on same. <br />Stars and Stripes reporters by the very nature of their jobs probably saw more of the war than anyone else.  So not only are we treated to a view of the the war from a different perspective other than the soldier's but  a view broader in scope and content. He was there when many historical events were unfolding. He met and interviewed many many people, big and small.  He went into the concentration camps hours after they were liberated.  Buchenwald and Thekla.<br />\\"Buchenwald represented the worst of everything in all the Nazi extermination camps. The dead and dying were still everywhere. The camp was unchanged, still the way it had been for all <BR>those terrible months except that there were cameramen there now, documenting the horror of it for all time.\\"<br />\\"The burned and blackened bodies of about sixty men were hanging in contorted positions from needle-point barbs of the wire. ...When the SS troops realized U.S. soldiers were going to <BR>arrive in Thekla within hours, they herded 300 prisoners into one of the barracks. They threw pails of gasoline over the barracks and onto some of the prisoners and then tossed <BR>incendiary grenades into the building.\\"<br />\\" Walking the same road a day or so after a tank had passed through, I would often come upon the gruesome sight of the whole halves of four or five men, and four or five halves of what <BR>had been men, mashed into the dirt and mud by the grinding tracks of a ten-ton tank.\\"  He's talking about our tanks here rolling over our dead.<br />Mr. Rooney puts W.W.II into more of a human ground level perspective. He shows you details, such as the many animal who suffered. Cows wandering the fields with painful utters <BR>swollen with milk and no one there to milk them..... Horses and mules mowed down in battle. Abandoned pets. <br />I learned a few things here. I'm happy I read the book. Mr. R is up-front and honest and that's all that counts.  He's not afraid to speak his mind like most people, thank god!  I love him <BR>(his opinions 99% of the time are mine).<br />This would make a great movie. I envy his life.  Hell, as he scrambled behind a French farmers stone wall to avoid heavy German artillery fire he found himself in the company of Ernest <BR>Hemingway! Just him and Ernie out there.

Government gridlock explained. How it all got started and how it all got out of hand. He gives many examples that will have you shaking your head in disgust. What got my goat was the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). What a bunch of ruthless selfish people involved in that. The idea is right but in practice it is abused. To think that gifted children (the future brains of our country/world), in comparison to disabled children (kids who don't even know they are alive etc.), receive virtually NO support or attention from America's school system. These disabled kids, who will never fully function in the world, now take precedence over the normal and gifted kids. And who's paying for all this costly extra attention, programs, teachers, classrooms for these autistic/severly retarded/catatonic kids? YOU with your taxes. What happened to Perspective. Priorities. Majority rules. Reason. Statistics. Compromise. Common sense is right! I had no idea this was going on. It's absurd. Wrong. <br />I live in a town of 7,500 out in the boonies and have seen only ONE (1) wheelchaired person, yet our town is wheelchair fitted thru out. Even on the steep hillside streets where no wheelchair could possible go. In fact that one wheelchaired person is forcing our little library to put in all new restroom facilities that are wheelchair friendly. The librarian told me it has taken most all of her budget. Which she says means no new computers or books till next year. As it is now they can only afford to open for 4 days (6hr. days) outta 7. I never thought too much about it until now after having read this book. But now, Mr. Howard, how do we change it? Your next project is to lay out a step by step guide we the voters can follow to correct this mess. I'd like to see Mr. Howard on TV. Maybe on The Point With Greta Van Susteren, CourtSide with Roger Cossack or Larry King ... This is an eye opener of a book and should be required reading for all.	2001-08-24

She  enlightens you as to all the back room deals / politicking that favors the rapist / abuser instead of the victim.  How rape/sexual abuse are trivialized.  It's a sad commentary on our justice system and us as human beings,  but I am still hopeful knowing a warrior like Ms Vachss is there.  <br />This is her and her husbands (Andrew, who writes bloody awful fiction novels) fight.  Let's hope for a KO. I hope she writes more for us, she's that good and interesting.   I'm shocked and sorta put out that there aren't  more reviews here. Maybe Ms Vachss should do a speaking tour of some kind.  Her kind of good deeds need  advertising.<br />And to the reviewer &quot;What an ego&quot;.

He also explains how  the Calif. justice system worked at the time of the crime and how it has evolved in  dealing with these type of crimes/people. Which was an eye opener for me. His  view, and I agree, being that the system is failing to protect us by overly protecting  the defendants instead, by playing politics and loosing sight of the gross/obvious  facts in arguing the minute details of the law. <br />I for one thought the parents of Richard Chase the &quot;Vampire of Sacramento&quot; should  of been charged as aiding/abetting and equally punished. They knew what their son  was doing from a very early age and never got him help, never informed anyone.  Instead they took him out of hospitals the state put him in and weaned him off his  medication. I see them as more guilty than their son.	2001-04-26

Victor Ostrovsky says: &quot;I was elated when I was chosen and granted the privilege to join what I considered  to be the elite team of the Mossad.<br />But it was the twisted ideals and self-centered pragmatism that I encountered inside  the Mossad, coupled with this so-called team's greed, lust, and lack of respect for human life, that motivated me to tell this story.&quot;<br />He blames the Mossad for &quot;turning the Zionist dream into the present-day nightmare.&quot;  For choosing war and hate over peace in the middle east. It is from  Victor  Ostrovsky's personal experiences that he makes these claims. It's very interesting and  eye opening. And after reading this book you will want to know more about this  Mossad.<br />He talks about the fact that they are entrenched in the USA. That the Mossad owns  hundreds of homes in the New York and Washington D.C.. How jewish businessmen all around the world agree to provide for the Mossad when  ever they are called upon to do so. Providing money, businesses for cover, houses,  apartments, cars, boats....you name it.<br />In this book you will read how in Washington D.C. 1979, the Mossad &quot;thru their  network of electronic bugs at the homes and offices of various Arab ambassadors and leaders in New York and Washington&quot; forced US Ambassador  Andrew Young's to resign because he recognized the PLO. Young was open to both sides. And because of that he was seen as anti-sementic, anti-Israeli and therefore  had to be eliminated.<br />How the Mossad didn't like Yitzhak Rabin because he &quot;demanded raw data from  intelligence, rather than the distilled version normally offered, making it much more difficult for the Mossad to use their information to set the agenda the way they  wanted.&quot; They couldn't manipulate Rabin so they searched and search and finally found a way  to discredit him. Mrs. Rabin, against Israeli law, had a foreign bank account with less than $10,000 in New York. Mrs. Rabien used it when traveling  there even though she was entitled, as the prime minister's wife, to have all her expenses paid by the government.  When the time was right the Mossad released  that information thereby assuring Rabins fall and Menachem Begins installation as  prime minister. Menachem Begin was their type of man. He was a hawk. A dedicated Arab  hater.<br />How the Mossad will supply any country with military training, weapons and ammo.  for the right price. And has no qualms about sells opium and hashish. Everybody is a  target...and  to be exploited.  Everyone is the enemy in the Mossads eyes.<br />You will come away from this book seeing Jews in a different light. A dim light. I've  been told that the Jews see themselves as gods chosen people. Chosen for what tho  you will ask after reading this. To be an example of evil? Are they gods gift...or  satans?<br />Mr. Ostrovsky says that Jews will forever be seeking revenge for the six million Jews  killed in the Holocaust. That they conveniently forget that they weren't the only ones.  That some 47 million one hundred and ninety nine thousand people were killed, from  14 different countries and of all manner of religious beliefs.  He says &quot;The Holocaust  could have been a source for unity with other nations rather than a tool for  separation.<br />I've always found it odd how religions and the followers of, can be some of the most  intolerant and hateful people. The very things that most religions teach against. I've  never understood it. But then I've never been religious.<br />This is my first book on the subject of Israel so I can not making anyjudgments.  But  my interest is peeked so I will read more from various sources.	2000-12-25

It's a non-fiction about how Ross Perot (using his top execs. and Green Beret Col. Bull Simon (ret.)) breaks his (innocent) people out of a Tehran, Iran prison and Iran, overland during the February 9th, 1979  revolution, when Ayatollah Khomeini had led the overthrow of the pro-West shah.  Very exciting. They were, as Col. Bull Simons states, witnessing history in the making. They were right in the center of a very violent revolution. I mean right there in the streets while it was going on. WHEW!<br />This also Shows you what a lotta money can and can't do<br />My only rant is why there wasn't a picture of Rashid! Rashid is the real hero. He  picked up a gun and incited the revolutionaries to storm the prison and break  everyone out. Then he took the Americans overland thru hostile bandit and Kurdish  tribal territory at the foot of the freezing Elburz Mts. to the Turkey border town of  Sero. Securing their safe escape. If it wasn't for Rashid,  Bill and Paul would still be in prison and the rest still  waiting at the Hyatt Hotel<br />I mean there are pictures of Ross Perots mother and son for christ sake, who weren't  even involved in this,  yet there are  no pictures (except one of his backside) of the  man who saved them all. Rashid. That's inexcusable.<br />Ross Perot makes a statement in the book  I feel everyone should learn and teach their kids.<br />&quot;But if you go through life worrying about all the bad things that   can happen, you soon convince yourself that  it's best to do nothing at all&quot;<br />I believe that should be chiseled on plaques and mounted  in every school yard and class room across the nation.<br />Again, this shows you what a lotta money can and can't do. Great read!	2000-12-16

Where is the story? and Let's get on with it!&quot;<br />As in Mr. X and Ghost Story  Mr. Straub takes you on a boring meandering trip to  nowhere.    Example:  Porkpie Hat.  Mr. Straub takes 20 pgs to introduce this 'main' character  Hat,  as the all time greatest sax musician blah blah blah. Yet all that  build up has absolutely  nothing to do with the 'real story', which is a  dull adventure of two kids on Halloween  night into a back woods community.   <br />Only two of the stories were half decent. The Ghost Village I've read  before somewhere and I believe it's a little history to The  Blue Rose  Murders series (Koko, Mystery, The Throat). It's a Vietnam  experiance.<br />'Bunny is Good Bread' started out great but in what seems to  be Mr.Straubs sometime  fashion/tendancy, it soon became redundant  therefore it stalled and slowly died.  It also  I believe is connected to  the Blue Rose Murders too tho I'm not sure, it's been a very  long time  sense I read the The Blue Rose Murders series (Koko, Mystery, The  Throat).   <br />I have not  read all of Peter Straubs books but from what I have read  I've concluded  that there are two Peter Straubs. Spilt personality?<br />The  Hellfire Club, Mystery, The Throat, Shadowland and of course The Talisman  are  beautiful stories. I love em!<br />Ghost Story, Mr. X, Koko, Houses  Without Doors, Mrs. God and now this Magic  Terror are not stories at all,  in my opinion, but just ramblings. There's no core or thread  to the  writing in these books.  And Mr. Srtraub kills any kind of feelings for or   connections with the characters and their situation by endless repetive  ramblings. <br />It's like he just keeps tapping you on the shoulder over and  over and OVER! till you just want to whip  around and scream,  ALL RIGHT  ALREADY, I HEAR YA!	2000-07-16

This is the second J.Herbert I've tried and all I can  say is _he stinks. He's a sham. His writing and ideas are unimaginative, unsophisticated  ...childish drivel. No horror here.  <br />As an &quot;End Note&quot; to the book James Herbert states: &quot; This  story is based on a true incident that occurred in a certain London  children's  hospital some years ago and was related to me by the now  elderly person involved, At  least two of the main protagonists are known  to me personally (one, alas, now  deceased) and, lest I be accused of  possessing an inordinately warped imagination, I  should point out that  most of the 'others' described herein are taken from actual medical  case  histories. &quot;<br />What I have to say to that is TO BAD HERBERT DIDN'T  HAVE THE CLASS AND  RESPECT TO DO THEM JUSTICE !<br />If you want real horror,   read: <br />Stephen King: ALL<br />Peter Straub: The Hellfire club, Mystery, The  Throat, Shadowland, Talisman <br />Robert R.

You know what I  mean. Every time a woman (kathy included) appears (not just in her initial introduction  but EVERY time she steps on the  page) Emerson drools over how  perfectly gorgeous,  sexy etc. etc. her eyes  are and her hair is and her legs are. Over and over. Hey I don't  need to  be told over and over the color of someones eyes, hair, skin. I mean what  is  this? Emerson trying to fill-up the pages or is he just a shallow  sexist jerk. And naturally  most all the women in his books are stunning  beauties all hot to trot or they are sick  pathetic gutter dogs. The men  are usually ugly, potbellied freaks.   <br />Out side of that, Emerson's  Thomas Black Mysteries are superior to most of what's out  there. Full of  fun and wit. Interesting plots that have depth and breadth.  Highly   recommended.<br />Now, his Mac Fontana Mysteries are not very good. In fact  it's hard to believe Emerson  wrote them. <br />Thomas Black Mysteries: in  order, first to last The Rainy City, Poverty Bay, Nervous Laughter, Fat  Tuesday, Deviant Behavior Yellow Dog Party, The Portland Laugher, The  Vanishing Smile, The Million-Dollar  Tattoo, Catfish Café. <br /> Mac Fontana  Mysteries: in order, first to last Black Hearts and Slow Dancing, Help  Wanted: Orphans Preferred, Morons and  Madmen, Going Crazy in Public, The  Dead Horse Paint Company	2000-02-01

He is waaaay too far off the wall to even be half way believable/acceptable. All  the characters in Vachss's books  are unrealistic in the extreme. There is no connecting  with any of them,  which is what makes Vachss's books such a ...waste.  Not to mention  Vachss  can't seem to write a complete sentence.  <br />It might take Burke/Vachss 3  pages to spit out one lousy point because Burke is SO  intent on/consumed  with belittling and interrupting whom ever he is speaking. I call that   ABUSE. <br />ANYWAY my point is, Burke, in my opinion, is not a good spokes  person for child  abuse/hate crimes or anything for that matter. <br />Vachss  writes in herky jerky incomplete sentences. Conversations are always being   rudely interrupted or are being carried on in jive a#! bs. Aggravating, not  to mention  extremely juvenile. The actual story, if you can call it that,  takes a back seat to the ego  jockeying and paranoia.The story is an after  thought and it shows. Zero dimension Vachss's books lack feeling. I get no  sense of anger...or outrage...absolutely  NOTHING. <br />If Vachss wants to  reach a wider audience with his abuse message he's gonna have to get Burke  in to see a psychdoc...get him some medication for that paranoia and   delusions of grandeur.  Oh and loose Mama. That whole oriental jag is  dumber than dumb. Ace the Prof, Strega the witch and the voodoo mumbo  jumbo. Cripe! get real.  BETTER YET, ace Burke and his whole crew/family  and try again. <br />People outside of New York just don't understand all that  stupid jive posturing. WHY? Because it does not apply.  Vachss needs to  read CLOCKERS by Richard Stark. Or my favorite Dennis Lehane, &quot;Gone,  Baby, Gone&quot;, &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot;	1999-12-28

To me it was a PI  mystery with a twist. A very imaginative twist too but one that William Hjortsberg failed  to bring alive.  The whole book  read like an old Raymond Chandler. That's it.  There is no suspense. No  buildup. No horror. No nothing really...it's a very blah book.  Easy to  read...nice point A to point B style but DULLSVILLE. The other reviewers  must have been reading a different book. This book is nothing like a   Stephen King or Dean Koontz book....not even close!...not in the slightest.

I have just reread it again (uncut version) and can't see what it was I liked about it!   <br />First off this uncut version is nothing but pointless, useless  detailed characterization. These 300+ pages didn't add a single positive to  the overall story. And in fact in my  opinion degraded it (if that is  possible)<br />A &quot;bug&quot; get loose and kills off 99% of world pop. The  US survivors slowly find their  calling either with the good guys in  Boulder, Colo. or with the bad guys in Las Vegas.<br />The whole story came  off as inane and childish. The characters acted like a bunch of  lame silly  morons. Tacky.  I know I personally would find watching everyone around me  die horrible deaths and  finding myself spared, quite humbling.  I also  would be extremely scared and dead  serious.<br />And why oh why would they(or  God) choose Boulder, Colo.?, where you are snowed  in half the year?  Why  not setup base in the SF Bay Area where there is mild weather, silicon  valley, 3 airports, military bases, Berkeley U, Stanford U,  Lawrence  Livermore   Lab., the Pacific ocean, shipping,  San Joaquin Valley   I mean  come on get real! <br />It started out fantastic but quickly deteriorated into  a kiddy story. It should of been done  in a more serious manner.  I've  never seen the movie but I can just imagine how hokey that is. I concur  with all the other 1 &amp; 2 star reviews.

First off:  I find that ALL Alice Hoffman books are written like  fairy tales, and I read them as such. They are strangely magical. <br />Consequently I give her license to be bizarre and off-the-wall   BUT...this time she  went tooo far. The character's characters  were just too unbelievable.  Everyone of em is a slave to their past. <br />This is a story about sickness,  degradation &amp; destruction.  Not a subject matter I personally care to  read about and not one  Alice Hoffman seems able to properly address.  Maybe, like me, she just doesn't care for the subject matter. I don't blame  her. <br />Maybe her worst to date. Skip it. BUT what ever you do don't  judge  Alice Hoffman by this book alone.  Read  TURTLE MOON , her best to date.   Second Nature, Seventh Heaven &amp; Practical Magic are good too.<br />The  reviewer from St. Paul, Minnesota says they are currently fashioning a  movie out of this book. EEEgods! Heaven forbid!  The continuity crew and  rewrite team are going to be working over  time, that's for sure. Oh  Well.<br />This is not a love story by the way. If that's what Oprah told you   she is obviously confused as to the meaning of the word love.  So be  aware... forewarned	1999-10-17

BUT stories 2-5 hang off story 1. Story 1 being the best and the rest  unfortunately, like I said,  just sorta hanging there. Especially Blind Willie.  Don't expect roller  coaster chills and thrills or even a  strong ending. I was disappointed at  it's lack of hills and valleys..and a strong end but then..<br />.. it was  still a pleasure just to be reading Stephen King's words. The man has a way  with em.  His imagination and ability to relate are genius. <br />Anyway, this  IS a definite step in the right direction, especially after his two  previous debacles,  Storm of the Century(peeU) and that The Girl Who Loved  Tom Gordon (uck!).

I don't know what every body else was reading, but in my opinion this book failed miserably!<br />Very poor writing.  The characters were disgracefully stereotypical, wooden to the point of   petrified.  Narratives were kindergarten faire.  Simpleton.  There was no page-  turning suspense and the story wasn't interesting in the least.  &quot;gritty  police procedural&quot; ?  What?  Where?	1999-10-06

What a let down.  Why did Nevin even bother. He doesn't seem to care about telling his story. I know I didn't care about the characters, their journey...etc.  nothing.  There was no spark!<br />Niven just couldn't flesh out his brilliant  ideas. The story, the people lacked depth and  excitement. It was an  emotionally deadpan telling. There were no feelings, no high-five   crescendos or swoops into possible doom.   Descriptions were very poor. I  never got a real picture in my mind as to where I was or what I  was  suppose to be seeing.  <br />Frank Herbert (author of the DUNE series) must of  been a literary SF genius or a lone freak of  nature because I have not  been able to find a book/author that comes within light years of him.   And  DUNE was written in 1965!! You think SF authors would be required to meet  or at least come close to Frank Herbert's  quality in order to be  considered for publishing    What happened to pride of workmanship?	1999-09-26
